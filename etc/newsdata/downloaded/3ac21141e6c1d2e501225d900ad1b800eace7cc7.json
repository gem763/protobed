Good luck,' Allen told Weinstein, explaining that there was nothing he could do to stop the story.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHarv-ary: A publicist for Hillary Clinton (above in 2012 with Clinton) told Farrow that his 'big story' was a 'concern for us' when the journalist sought access to the presidential hopeful\n\nWood-vey: Days before the expose dropped, Weinstein even called Farrow's estranged father Woody Allen (above in 2008), who said: 'Jeez, I'm so sorry. Good luck'\n\nFarrow published his expose on Weinstein five days after The New York Times.\n\nHis reporting was aided at the time by work previously done for the New Yorker by Ken Auletta, who had learned of a number of incidents involving the mogul in the early aughts.\n\nFarrow would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for his work.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON AND STAFF\n\nFarrow's claims about Clinton and AMI were first reported by The New York Times in a story that cited separate specific incidents.\n\nIn that story, from December 2017, Merrill was asked bout Weinstein's behavior, and said: 'We were shocked when we learned what he\u2019d done. It\u2019s despicable behavior, and the women that have come forward have shown enormous courage.'\n\nMamma Mia: Farrow's sister and uncle were named in a letter from Weinstein's lawyer\n\nThat would have been months after he referenced Farrow's 'big story.'\n\nThe Times reported that Lena Dunham told multiple members of Clinton's staff about Weinstein's behavior well before the publication of both exposes.\n\n'I just want you to let you know that Harvey\u2019s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,' said Dunham.\n\n'I think it\u2019s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.'\n\nDunham was assured her concerns would be relayed to campaign manager Robby Mook, but later shared her story again with a spokesperson when the campaign continued to have Weinstein spearhead events and fundraisers for Clinton.\n\nMerrill, when confronted with Dunham's recollections, said: 'As to claims about a warning, that\u2019s something staff wouldn\u2019t forget.'\n\nAMERICAN MEDIA AND DYLAN HOWARD\n\nThe Times report also noted how AMI utilized the practice of 'catch and kill' to make sure that Weinstein accuser Ambra Battilana Gutierrez could not share her allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nFarrow claims that NBC killed his story after an hours-long strategy session between AMI's chief content officer Dylan Howard and Weinstein.\n\nHoward came to that meeting with a trove of information about NBC in dossiers, and in the end Weinstein chose to use Lauer to kill the story according to Farrow.\n\n'Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it,' writes Farrow in his book.\n\nAMI does not deny this relationship with Weinstein, and has stated previously that any work done of his behalf took place before any allegations of sexual misconduct became public.\n\n'NBC News was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter,' said a spokesperson for the network.\n\n'And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity. NBC meanwhile scoffed at Farrow's claim that a tabloid's threat would be powerful enough to shut down a project at the network.'\n\nRon-on: Farrow says that his boyfriend Jon Lovett was a constant source of support as he navigated his future post-NBC\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nWeinstein's lawyer tried to get Farrow to kill his own story with a letter referencing various members of his family, recalls the journalist.\n\nIn that letter, Charles Harder 'asserted Farrow's motives were related to his sister Dylan's assault allegations against their father, Woody Allen.\n\nHarder wrote: 'Mr. Farrow is entitled to his private anger.'\n\nHe then made reference to Farrow's uncle, who is in jail for sexually abusing two boys.\n\n'We have yet to find any evidence that Ronan Farrow has publicly denounced his uncle, and he might have publicly supported him,' wrote Harder.\n\nUncle: John Villiers-Farrow was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the sexual abuse of two young boys\n\nFarrow says that he has never met his uncle.\n\nJohn Villiers-Farrow was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the sexual abuse of two young boys over an eight-year period\n\nThe first victim moved near to Villiers-Farrow\u2019s home when he was six-years-old, and came to know the family because they had a son who was a few years younger than him.\n\nThe victim spent a lot of time at the family's home and Villiers-Farrow would buy him gifts, take him to baseball games and on other trips, the arrest document states.\n\nIn the same time period, a second boy who was friends with the first victim, was abused about a dozen times over five years, Deputy State Attorney Kathleen Rogers said.\n\nThe victims told police that he would show them pornographic movies. The encounters escalated to touching and then to oral sex.\n\nVilliers-Farrow\u2019s wife has stood by her husband since he was arrested and called the victims - who are now 20-years-old - 'vipers'.\n\nAt the height of all this, Farrow lost his job with NBC, but he says that his boyfriend Jon Lovett was a constant source of support as he navigated his future.\n\n'I'll take care of you, baby. I'll keep you in finery and smoothies,' Farrow recalled Lovett telling him at one point.\n\nRose off the bloom: Lisa Bloom worked with Harvey Weinstein (in October 2017 outside his office just five minutes after the Times story was published online) for a year prior to the publication of the two exposes that brought him down in The New York Times and New Yorker\n\nLISA BLOOM\n\nThe daughter of famed attorney Gloria Allred had befriend Farrow and been talking to him for months before revealing she was working for Weinstein.\n\nFarrow believed that Blook had exposed his reporting at the time, not realizing the situation was actually much worse.\n\n'Lisa, you swore, as an attorney and a friend, that you wouldn\u2019t tell his people,' Farrow recalls saying to Bloom.\n\n'Ronan, I am his people,' said Bloom.\n\n'I thought of her calls and texts and voicemails pressing me for information, dangling clients,' writes Farrow.\n\n'Bloom told me Weinstein had optioned her book, that she\u2019d been in an awkward position. \"Ronan, you need to come in. I can help. I can talk to David [Boies] and Harvey. I can make this easier for you.'\n\nFarrow says that he told her the conversation was not appropriate, and ended his relationship with Bloom.\n\nShe tweeted when that story broke, saying: 'Attorneys must maintain confidentiality even when awful, untrue things are said about us. Welp, I did sign up for this.'\n\nAt the time, Bloom had already managed to get New York to kill a piece about Weinstein which had been scheduled to run in late 2016, around the time she first learned about the mogul's alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nIn the email, sent after her first meeting with Weinstein, Bloom outlined a number of tactics for how to take on these stories, including how he could start a foundation in honor of his recently deceased mother and elicit sympathy ahead of publication.\n\nShe also said that he should emulate Charlie Sheen in getting out there first with his story, like Sheen did after his HIV diagnosis was set to break in the press.\n\n'You should be the hero of the story, not the villain. This is very doable,' said Bloom in the email, which was obtained by Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.\n\nShe also detailed an aggressive plan to take down Rose McGowan, calling her a 'pathological liar' and dangerous.\n\nThe most damning line however was about victims of sex crimes, which at the time constituted almost her entire client list.\n\n'I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them,' wrote Bloom.\n\n'They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed.'\n\nMATT LAUER\n\nAfter Farrow's report on Weinstein ran in the New Yorker, Lauer texted the journalist, writing: 'Ronan, it\u2019s Matt Lauer. Let me be the 567th person to say congratulations on an amazing piece!'\n\nANDY LACK\n\nFarrow takes aim at lack in the book by dragging up stories from his past, including his affair with a CBS anchor Jane Wallace.\n\nIt is an affair that Wallace has been open about and Lack has denied and declined to speak about, though those who worked with the two on the show West 57th are clear that the two were involved in a relationship.\n\n'Andy was giving her the lead pieces,' recalled Meredith Vieira in a 1992 interview in the Sun Sentinel.\n\n'There was a lot of resentment. She affected a lot of lives.'\n\nWest 57th was described as '60 Minutes for the MTV crowd,' and in fact there was a good degree of Real-World-like drama happening backstage.\n\n'Jane claimed her work load was ruining her personal life, but that she couldn't say no to her bosses because she was afraid she'd be bypassed,' said co-host Bob Sirott in that interview.\n\n'By then, there were a lot of shouting matches with Andy. I thought they were work-oriented, but they must have been personal. Jane was self-destructing. She had a martyr complex.'\n\nAnd a co-worker on the program noted: 'When her romance with Lack went sour, Jane flipped out. She became vindictive. She did outrageous things. She threatened to leave the show if her demands weren't met. She tried to destroy Lack, and in the end destroyed herself.'\n\nNone of that makes it into Farrow's book.\n\nNOAH OPPENHEIM\n\nFarrow claims that Oppenheim was afraid to burn bridges with Weinstein due to his budding career as a screenwriter, and that was why he worked to kill the story.\n\nThis all happened as his screenplay for the film Jackie was being met with great acclaim and talks of possible awards.\n\nFarrow writes that Oppenheim was particularly concerned to learn that Weinstein had distributed one of his father's films, which he felt added weight to the claim that this was all being done in revenge for his sister Dylan's alleged assault.\n\nVariety reports that when Oppenheim learned this fact, he summoned Farrow and said: 'I\u2019d be happier if he found video of you f***ing in a bathroom or something.'\n\nThis all left Farrow feeling like the network was quietly trying to kill his story, a claim that Oppenheim strongly denied in a statement.\n\n'All we\u2019ve asked of Ronan is that he tell the truth - that when he left NBC he did not have a single victim or witness to misconduct by Weinstein willing to go on the record and that is why a large circle of his colleagues, including the head of the investigative unit and two of the most seasoned investigative reporters in the newsroom, all agreed that he did not yet have a story that was ready for air,' explained Oppenheim.\n\nIt was also stated by multiple NBC employees that farrow refused requests to expand his team with editors and reporters working for NBC.", "description": "In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Farrow said that among those Weinstein turned to were Hillary Clinton, the editors of American Media and even his estranged father Woody Allen.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/19/19505166-0-image-a-6_1570645950772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
