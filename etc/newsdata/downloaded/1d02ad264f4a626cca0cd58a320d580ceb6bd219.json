REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/File Photo\n\nWARSAW (Reuters) - Polish banks will face costs of 20 billion to 30 billion zlotys ($5.1-$7.6 billion) due to the European Court of Justice\u2019s (ECJ) ruling on Swiss-franc mortgages, Polish rate-setter Eugeniusz Gatnar told news agency PAP in comments published on Monday.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s (EU) top court ruled on Thursday in favor of Polish consumers who took out mortgages in Swiss Francs, allowing them to ask Polish courts to convert the loans into the local zloty currency in a blow for lenders.\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the ECJ will not have any major negative impact on the stability of the banking sector in Poland, because it does not introduce an obligatory mechanism for the conversion of Swiss franc loans,\u201d Gatnar told the state-run news agency.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the process of changing contracts will be voluntary, and some borrowers will not ask for it.\u201d\n\nGatnar added that he believed the verdict could speed up consolidation in the sector.\n\nLenders have said the cost of the verdict could amount to 60 billion zlotys.", "description": "Polish banks will face costs of 20 billion to 30 billion zlotys ($5.1-$7.6 billion) due to the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) ruling on Swiss-franc mortgages, Polish rate-setter Eugeniusz Gatnar told news agency PAP in comments published on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437969856&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960A7", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
