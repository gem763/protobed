They will try to do their best, so I am not going to judge them on that or prepare to play against them based on what happened against Leicester.\n\n\"It's a little bit strange. Red card, first goal, and then every time (Leicester) arrive in the first minutes, goal, goal.\n\n\"We know the team Leicester are. It was not easy. But it's different competitions, the Carabao Cup and the Premier League. And we will try (to prepare) to face good teams.\"\n\nGuardiola will have at least one change enforced upon him on Tuesday with Fernandinho suspended following his late red card in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa, but he was already expected to bring in a number of youngsters and fringe players.\n\nTeenage defenders Eric Garcia and Taylor Harwood-Bellis could get their chance given City's shortages at the back, while Angelino will hope to start at left-back after coming off the bench on Saturday.\n\nWith Rodri sidelined as well as Fernandinho, Guardiola will have to decide whether to retain Ilkay Gundogan in midfield or rest the Germany international.\n\nIf he plays, Gundogan said he will be prepared for a Southampton response.\n\n\"I don't think they [Southampton] will be full of confidence, so they might be defending really deep, with a lot of passion,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be prepared, we need to be ready to play them a couple of times in a row. The first time is already a final, obviously we want to go through the next round.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy, especially for their last result. They will probably want to prove to everyone that they are not a bad team.\n\n\"I think it's going to be even more difficult, but we are going to work hard to get the two wins.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Pep Guardiola is not counting on Southampton suffering any kind of hangover when they visit Manchester City in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night.
