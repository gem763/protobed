And for Boris Johnson, the U.K. prime minister, that might not be a terrible outcome.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which is part of Johnson\u2019s ruling coalition, has said they won\u2019t back the latest deal. The Labour Party also is opposed. On Johnson\u2019s right, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has urged the U.K. Parliament to reject the new tentative deal reached between the British government and the European Union.\n\nJohnson will need 320 votes in the U.K. Parliament for the Brexit deal to be approved.\n\nEven if all Conservative Party MPs back the deal, Johnson will need help. \u201cJohnson\u2019s math has him needing 61 votes from a possible 85 and that will be a tall task as he is still seeing resistance from Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP, the party that holds what many consider 10 critical votes,\u201d said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, a foreign currency trading platform.\n\nKallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, said even winning over MPs Johnson kicked out of the party as well as Labour and independent MPs who previously voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal, Johnson will still be short by 6 votes.\n\nConstantine Fraser, political analyst at TS Lombard, points out that Johnson will now have this deal rather than a hard Brexit to run on if the U.K. were to hold a general election.\n\n\u201cThe main takeaway is that the Conservative party is now committed to this deal, not no-deal, and will campaign for a majority for it if the coming general election takes place before the U.K. has left the E.U.,\u201d Fraser said.\n\nOliver Harvey, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank, said the most likely outcome if the deal is not ratified would be a general election in November.\n\n\u201cIf the government were to lose a ratification vote on Saturday, Prime Minister Johnson could request an extension to Article 50 from the EU27 and table a motion under the Fixed Term Parliament Act to hold an election in November. If opposition parties refused to vote for an election, he could resign and instruct his cabinet to do the same. The political pressure to hold such an election would be high, as a caretaker government formed under these circumstances would be seen as politically illegitimate,\u201d he said in a note to clients.\n\nSky News, however, reported that Johnson has told European Union leaders he will not ask for an extension of the planned Oct. 31 exit date if Parliament doesn\u2019t approve the deal. That\u2019s despite Parliament passing a law saying he would have to do so in that situation.\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, +0.2261% shot up as high as $1.2987 before trading lower.\n\nThe FTSE 100 UKX, +0.68% of top British companies on the London Stock Exchange rose 0.9%.", "description": "The Brexit pact reached between the European Union and Britain will struggle to get through the U.K. Parliament.
