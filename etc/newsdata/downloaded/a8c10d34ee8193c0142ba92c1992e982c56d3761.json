It was very, very hard. I was demonised, I was basically called the welsh dragon, the mother from hell, and I just thought it was very unfair.\n\n\u2018I was put in a position of dealing with all these top company people like Sony etc, I was just well out of my depth, and I thought I did pretty damn well.\n\n\u2018I used to battle for Charlotte like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u2019\n\nAsked where it went wrong between the two of them, Charlotte said: \u2018I think basically I don\u2019t think anything really went wrong, I think it was just like a pressure cooker. It was a really intense situation.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got the stuff going on with the press \u2013 they put things into very simple almost fairytale narratives. So mum became the evil stepmother, I became this fallen angel.\n\n\u2018So on one level there\u2019s that, and another level my mum and dad were dealing with the huge security risk that we had, there was a couple of kidnap plots and stuff when I was a kid. It was on lots of different levels a whole load of stress and pressure.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked if it led to them being estranged, Charlotte\u2019s mum said: \u2018It was for a while when Charlotte left home and it was very brutal and very sudden.\n\nCharlotte Church: My Family and Me airs this week (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018She broke my heart and I ended up having a nervous breakdown. I\u2019ve just started back in therapy now, it\u2019s early days but it\u2019s going really well. I\u2019ve always suffered with mental health issues.\u2019\n\nSpeaking about motivations behind the documentary, Charlotte revealed how they wanted to address misconceptions about her family.\n\n\u2018I think for me it was a chance for my mum and dad who have had a really rough ride in the press to set the record straight and show who they are,\u2019 Charlotte said.\n\n\u2018As they explore in the programme, he has a terminal illness, he wanted to show there\u2019s life after a terminal illness.\u2019\n\nYou can catch Charlotte Church: My Family And Me on Channel 4 Thursday at 9pm.\n\nMORE: Why did Charlotte Church fall out with her parents, when was she with Gavin Henson and what is her net worth?\n\nMORE: Charlotte Church reveals stepdad is terminally ill and could have six months to live", "description": "Charlotte Church and her mother appeared on This Morning.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/charlotte-church-main-f5a8_1571135273.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
