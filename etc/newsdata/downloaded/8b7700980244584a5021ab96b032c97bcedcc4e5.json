REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Photo\n\nKIEV (Reuters) - A senior Ukrainian security official offered to quit before President Volodymyr Zelenskiy began a visit to the United States this week, the president\u2019s office said on Friday.\n\nOleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, gave no reason for his decision and will stay on until Zelenskiy decides whether to accept his resignation, it said in a statement.\n\nThe statement gave no indication that the resignation was connected with a telephone call between Zelenskiy and Donald Trump that is at the center of a formal impeachment inquiry into the U.S. president.\n\nIn the July 25 call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for several years, according to a summary of the conversation released by the White House.\n\nBiden, a former vice president, is a leading contender in the Democratic race to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration also released a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that questioned whether U.S. aid was held up until Ukraine showed it would act on Trump\u2019s request.\n\nRelated Coverage Ukraine agency says investigating Burisma, but not when Hunter Biden was on board\n\nReuters could not immediately contact Danylyuk for comment. Earlier this week he told Reuters Ukraine did want not to be dragged into U.S. domestic politics.\n\nDanylyuk is a former finance minister who oversaw the nationalization of PrivatBank, Ukraine\u2019s largest lender, and his appointment to his security role in May sent a positive signal to investors gauging Zelenskiy\u2019s reformist credentials.\n\nInvestors are also looking for Kiev to conclude a new loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund to help underpin economic stability, tackle reforms and fight corruption.
