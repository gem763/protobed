But what it can\u2019t do is undo all of the very close economic ties that we have with the EU, on which so much of our trade as a country depends. And nor would we want to undo all of the close security ties that we have with the EU,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd because of the importance of those ties both for the EU and the UK, it will remain hugely important to have those expressed through a formal relationship. In other words, we\u2019re going to have to negotiate \u2013 and that negotiation on the future relationship starts with citizens, money and the border on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cSo the notion that no deal somehow means that we can turn our backs on the EU and break all our ties is just nonsensical.\u201d\n\nRycroft spent part of his career at the Scottish Office and in the Scottish Executive before working in Nick Clegg\u2019s office during the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, and helping to coordinate Whitehall\u2019s approach to devolution from the Cabinet Office.\n\nHe gave a speech on Monday warning that politicians should be thinking carefully about how to protect the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland after Brexit \u2013 deal or no deal.\n\n\u201cClearly at the moment, political time has collapsed: everything has become very short term, everyone\u2019s worrying about what\u2019s happening not even next week but tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those circumstances it\u2019s very different to be lifting their eyes to a more distant horizon. How do we manage as a country, if and when we come out of the EU?\u201d\n\nAfter this week\u2019s renewed clashes between Johnson\u2019s government and rebel MPs and the judiciary, Rycroft said it may be time to think about whether Britain\u2019s constitution is working \u2013 a question also raised by the Speaker, John Bercow, on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a written constitution: it relies on convention and precedent, and the spirit within which those conventions and precedents are regarded. And if those conventions and precedents are ignored, overturned, challenged \u2013 then the lack of a codified constitution becomes an issue,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would agree with those who would say in these circumstances, it may not be that you\u2019d need a written constitution as a whole, but as a minimum, some of the procedures, not least in the Houses of Parliament, are going to have to be codified for clarity on what the rules are. There is no doubt in my mind that we have reached that point.\u201d\n\nRycroft is about to take up a post at the University of Cambridge as a distinguished honorary researcher at the Bennett Institute for Public Policy and the department for politics and internal studies.\n\nHe warned against the growing tendency in public debate to denigrate civil servants and blame them for the failings of their political masters.\n\n\u201cCivil servants do their job for governments of the day, delivering the policies of the government of the day, and that\u2019s just as true for Brexit as for anything else.\u201d He said claims his erstwhile colleague Olly Robbins had sought to stymie the government\u2019s negotiating efforts were \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d.\n\nRobbins left Whitehall as Johnson took over and it emerged recently that he had taken a job at the investment bank Goldman Sachs.", "description": "A no-deal exit would trigger complex negotiations, argues former top DexEU civil servant", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30840e5e31c2e4e13e8865069fedd83f15197926/65_0_587_352/master/587.png?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2aa88e5ea001387abd2f5dd4a2f680e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
