My building superintendent had told me that he\u2019d seen men lurking outside,' writes Farrow.\n\n'Sources had advised me to get a gun and move out of my apartment.'\n\nHe would later learn that on this day, two men were pinpointing his location with startling accuracy.\n\n'The day of that meeting, hundreds of text messages flooded my phone. \"(Survey) Should Trump be impeached?\" they said, one after another. \"Reply to cast your vote. To unsubscribe from our list . . .,\" writes Farrow.\n\n'Each came from a different number. I swiped away the texts, then finally gave up and responded to opt out, which seemed not to help. In the same time frame, unbeknownst to me, Khaykin was sending Ostrovskiy the maps accurately pinpointing my location.'\n\nUnder watch: New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor (left) and Megan Twohey (center with Ashley Judd on right) were also spied on according to Farrow\n\nSpied upon: Actresses Rosanna Arquette (left) and Anabella Scioram (right) were also being monitored according to Farrow\n\nIt was after he published his story on Black Cube that he was contacted by an individual who wanted to offer up information about the plot to spy on Weinstein's accusers and journalists.\n\nThat individual was Ostrovskiy, one of the men hired to spy on him, who said he was concerned that he might be involved in 'illegal' activity.\n\nHe revealed that he was not even aware that Black Cube had hired him to follow Farrow, and provided the journalist with photos to confirm his many stakeouts.\n\nSoon after, Ostrovskiy stopped getting job assignments from Khaykin, and now he is starting his own firm.\n\nKhaykin, who has done work with Christian Louboutin in the past and has been hired to speak with Brooklyn residents about protecting themselves from fraud, did not comment for the story.\n\nHis company was still working with Black Cube according to Ostrovisky, and seemingly had no objections to the task they were hired to do as it pertained to Weinstein's case.\n\nWeinstein, who is set to head to trail early next year, has denied all allegations of sexual assault.", "description": "Ronan Farrow reveals in an excerpt from his upcoming novel Catch and Kill that he too was followed by two men in the months leading up to his explosive New Yorker expose.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19399606-0-image-a-2_1570460537459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
