Whether that is cycling nearly 4,000 miles across Europe in less than a fortnight, or journeying through life itself, it can sometimes seem impossible or unbearable for mind, body and spirit to continue, and yet somehow they keep going, always fearing that the seemingly impossible may indeed prove to be so.\n\nFailure was at the heart of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s 1914 expedition to Antarctica, his ship Endurance crushed by pack ice. The journey, as recounted in his book South, was remarkable not only because the entire 28-man crew survived their estrangement from the world for 22 months, but also for the relative good humour Shackleton reports.\n\nIn The Rise of the Ultra Runners, Adharanand Finn gives us an inside view of the mind-boggling world of long-distance running, and perfectly captures the ebb and flow of a long race; the moments when you feel you can\u2019t take another step, chased by those fleeting periods when you believe you might run for ever. And Sarah Outen, in Dare to Do, tells us that \u201cthe most enduring muscle of all is attitude. If you want to get there, you will.\u201d\n\nBut it ain\u2019t necessarily so, argues Alex Hutchinson, exploring \u201cthe curiously elastic limits of human performance\u201d in Endure. He delves meticulously into the \u201cmind over muscle\u201d conundrum of endurance \u2013 do we fail because our body stops working, or is it our brain that makes us give up? And how can we train each of them to take us just a little bit further?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018In prison, a person\u2019s essence comes to light,\u2019 writes Nawal el-Saadawi. Photograph: Mona Sharaf/Reuters\n\nEndurance, of course, isn\u2019t only about athletics and adventure. There\u2019s little glory in Dervla Murphy\u2019s Where the Indus Is Young, in which she spends a winter in northern Pakistan with her six-year-old daughter. Murphy turns her gaze on the inhabitants of Baltistan, whose hardships are not chosen, as hers are, as well as detailing the quotidian but nonetheless excruciating ordeals of travel \u2013 bureaucracy, kerosene shortages, illness \u2013 and admitting the occasional tedium of her daughter\u2019s company.\n\nThere is a stronger camaraderie in Nawal El Saadawi\u2019s Memoirs from the Women\u2019s Prison began its life written with eyeliner on hoarded pieces of toilet paper, and follows the Egyptian author through a three-month incarceration for \u201ccrimes against the state\u201d. \u201cIn prison, a person\u2019s essence comes to light,\u201d she writes, suggesting that endurance consists of the parts of a person that remain when trauma or exhaustion have scraped away all pretence.\n\nCrossing Asia on my bike, I met countless others out to see the world on a bicycle | Emily Chappell Read more\n\nSome people endure unintentionally, sometimes even without wanting to go on. The protagonist of Edmund White\u2019s autobiographical novel The Farewell Symphony looks back on the Aids crisis and the many men he loved, most of whom he knows \u2013 or guesses \u2013 must be dead by now. He invokes Haydn\u2019s eponymous composition, where \u201cmore and more of the musicians get up to leave the stage, blowing out their candles as they go. In the end just one violinist is still playing.\u201d Endurance is an act of survival, be it of a person\u2019s values and politics, their sense of humour, their will to go on or their very existence.\n\n\u2022 Where There\u2019s a Will: Hope, Grief and Endurance in a Cycle Race Across a Continent by Emily Chappell is published by Pursuit.", "description": "From Shackleton in the Antarctic to Edmund White on the Aids crisis, Emily Chappell rounds up stories of survival", "authors": ["Emily Chappell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/596c39b027d90323c67cfdf0a9d8814a4a101ab7/0_163_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77e10600bf44f113f96f89f56d1246b1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
