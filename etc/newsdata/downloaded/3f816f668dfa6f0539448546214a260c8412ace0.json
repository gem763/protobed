Like the Nexus range before it, the Google Pixel 4 is the ultimate Android smartphone, providing instant OS updates, peerless photography software and the latest Google apps. It's also more affordable than the equivalent flagships from Apple and Samsung. Here are all the plans from Telstra, Optus and Vodafone with links to buy!\n\nThe Pixel 4 costs $1049 to buy outright. If you don't have that kind of money lying around, your best bet is to pick it up on a mobile phone contract. Here are all the plans currently being offered by Australia's major telcos.\n\nPixel 4 plans: Telstra\n\nTelstra's Pixel 4 pricing starts at $79.13 a month, which nets you 15GB data. However, to get that price you need to stick with the plan for 36 months. (There's no lock-in contract, but you will need to pay off the remainder of the phone price if you decide to cancel.) Telstra's top plan will set you back $153.29 a month - that one comes with a more generous 150GB of data and a shorter 24-month contract.\n\nBonus: Telstra is offering a free Google Nest Hub if you sign up before January 13, 2020.\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nTelstra Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOur pick: 60GB Medium Mobile Plan ($89.13 per month).\n\nPixel 4 plans: Vodafone\n\nVodafone's cheapest plan will set you back $64.13 a month. However, that plan only comes with a paltry 5GB of data. The most expensive option is $124.54 over 24 months - that ups the data cap to 120GB.\n\nBonus: Customers who sign up to a Red Plan or Red Plus Plan before 23 October will receive a bonus JBL Link 10 Wireless Portable Speaker valued at $229.\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nVodafone Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOur pick: 30GB 'Endless Data' Red Plus Plan for $88.70 per month.\n\nPixel 4 plans: Optus\n\nOptus' cheapest plan costs $70 a month on a 36-month plan. Unfortunately, it only comes with 4GB data which is even worse than what Vodafone is offering.\n\nBonus: Optus will throw in a Harman Kardon Citation One Speaker if you order before December 31.\n\nOptus Pixel 4 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (24 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 64GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOptus Pixel 4 XL 128GB Plans (36 months)\n\nOur pick: 100GB Plan (20GB bonus data) for $77.91 per month.", "description": "Google's fourth-generation Pixel is now available to pre-order in Australia.
