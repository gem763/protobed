But facts on the ground change \u2015 and the facts on the ground right now suggest a really focused effort.\u201d\n\nCaroline Brehman/Getty Images Speaker Pelosi, right, addressed reporters alongside Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). Her support for an impeachment inquiry has largely quieted critics.\n\nNot everyone is content though. Heidi Hess, who runs the progressive phone company Credo\u2019s issue campaigns at Credo Action, expressed disappointment in Speaker Pelosi\u2019s press conference on Tuesday.\n\nHess is calling for a timeline for completing the investigation and a deadline to vote on articles of impeachment that are reported out. She fears that allowing the process to drag on could give Trump an opportunity to sow more chaos and diminish public support for the process.\n\n\u201cUnless we have deadlines, then for us, that is still them telegraphing that what [Democrats] want is to stall,\u201d she said.\n\nCredo Action, the nonpartisan, pro-democracy nonprofit Free Speech for People and several other groups have called for the House Judiciary Committee to report out articles of impeachment against Trump by Nov. 1 and a vote on those articles by Nov. 15. They are also demanding an immediate end to the current congressional recess in the interest of expediting the process.\n\nAnother priority for these liberal critics is impeaching Trump on the broadest possible grounds, which they worry Democratic leadership is not adequately interested in. Credo Action is part of a coalition of liberal groups and legal experts, under the intellectual leadership of Free Speech for People, calling for Trump to be impeached for at least 12 different reasons. The reasons, which the groups outlined in a July 30 letter to the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, fall under the broad categories of abuse of power, corruption of the electoral process, promotion of racial hostility, and corruption and self-enrichment.\n\n\u201cWe remain deeply concerned that Congress is not addressing this constitutional crisis with the urgency that\u2019s required at the moment,\u201d said John Bonifaz, an attorney and co-founder of Free Speech for People.\n\nBonifaz helped develop the coalition\u2019s list of impeachable offenses and advised Democratic Reps. Al Green of Texas and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan on their earlier efforts to initiate impeachment inquiries. He worries that failure to hold Trump accountable for the full scope of his misconduct could again set an \u201cextremely dangerous precedent\u201d for presidential impunity.\n\nHess cited the possibility of a repeat of the articles of impeachment against then-President Richard Nixon. Congress chose not to issue articles of impeachment related to Nixon\u2019s secret bombing of Cambodia, which Hess and other left-leaning activists regard as a mistake that helped future presidents prosecute foreign interventions illegally.\n\nPelosi has not set any explicit deadlines for the House Judiciary Committee to report out articles of impeachment. But at a press conference on Wednesday, the speaker warned that refusals by the Trump administration to cooperate with the House\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter would be regarded as obstruction of justice.\n\n\u201cWe do not want this to drag on for months and months, which appears to be the [White House\u2019s] strategy,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nA lot of the work on the other misconduct has already been done. I think [impeachment] will be broad and fast. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)\n\nPelosi has also said that House committees investigating other elements of Trump\u2019s potential misconduct will report their findings to the Judiciary Committee, leaving open the possibility that impeachment will cover a broader range of matters.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, stood out among his colleagues with a public appeal last week for Congress to postpone its two-week recess in order to work on the impeachment inquiry. He predicted that focusing on a broad range of Trump\u2019s misdeeds is compatible with a rapid process.\n\n\u201cA lot of the work on the other misconduct has already been done,\u201d Khanna told HuffPost. \u201cI think [impeachment] will be broad and fast.\u201d\n\nBut assurances like those are not enough for Hess, Bonifaz and some other outspoken progressives who worry that the absence of firmer commitments from Pelosi right now, when the pressure to placate the grassroots is perhaps greatest, raises the risk of a looser approach going forward.\n\nThe trouble for these Pelosi critics is that many of their normally allied organizations and activists are thus far unwilling to publicly criticize the speaker\u2019s management of the process.\n\nSpokespeople for the Democracy for America, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Indivisible all expressed support for an impeachment process that is both prompt and broad in scope without joining in criticism of Pelosi.\n\nMeagan Hatcher-Mays, who runs Indivisible\u2019s democracy program, shared Hess\u2019 commitment to a rapid process, as well as a wide-ranging inquiry. \u201cEvery day that he\u2019s in office is a new threat to our election security,\u201d she said. But Indivisible is not setting out a hard deadline; Hatcher-Mays said the group hopes it nears completion before Thanksgiving.\n\nSimilarly, PCCC spokeswoman Maria Langholz called Pelosi\u2019s approach of having committees of jurisdiction submit to the Judiciary Committee the results of their investigations into Trump \u201csmart.\u201d\n\nAnd Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, which rivals Credo Action and PCCC in online organizing heft, suggested a middle path in terms of the scope of the impeachment articles \u2015 something shy of 12, but more than just one about Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine.\n\nChamberlain said he is \u201cnot really concerned\u201d with the speed of the process so far, but he would like to see the House move on it quickly so it can proceed to the Senate. The sooner it gets there, he argued, the sooner it can be used against Republicans senators up for reelection in swing states.\n\n\u201cThe Senate has the most to lose here,\u201d he said.", "description": "Most activists are satisfied with House Democrats' approach, but some want more.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97a3902100006601a95d69.jpeg?cache=c9tgei5sih&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
