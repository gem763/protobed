Indeed, it showed that the intention was the exact opposite.\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to rule on the citizenship question in the next two weeks.\n\nWhile the Census and Russia scandals emerge from different sources, they\u2019re now more alike than different.\n\nWe\u2019re no longer talking about how a citizenship question would decrease Hispanic responses to the Senate, or whether Donald Trump obstructed justice by firing James Comey. We\u2019re talking about Trump administration officials covering up evidence and refusing congressional subpoenas.\n\nIn the case of the census, Trump administration officials may have violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and perhaps even the constitution. But in brazenly defying congressional subpoenas, they have flouted the rule of law itself, not to mention Congress\u2019s constitutionally-mandated powers.\n\nIn some ways, the cover-up is even worse than the crime.\n\n\u201cWe would be committing legislative malpractice if we didn\u2019t do our job,\u201d said Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings at the start of Wednesday\u2019s often rancorous hearings.\n\n\u201c Underneath the obstruction and contempt are a series of decisions that Republicans would prefer to keep secret. \u201d\n\nIndeed, while several Republican members of the committee tried to make the investigation about something else \u2013 \u201cwhy don\u2019t Democrats want to know how many citizens there are?\u201d asked Ohio congressman Jim Jordan \u2013 Democrats continued to hammer on the core of the contempt motion: the defiance of congressional subpoenas.\n\nRep. William Lacy Clay (D-MO) noted that Ross and Barr refused to answer over 100 questions. And while Republicans pointed out that Ross spent seven hours testifying to Congress, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) countered that \u201cevery answer he gave was designed to produce pain and consume time.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, neither action was a full-on vote on contempt of Congress. Wednesday\u2019s vote was only at the committee level, and the House opted not to find Barr and McGahn in contempt of congress, apparently in the hopes that a deal could still be worked out with them.\n\nBut underneath the obstruction and contempt are a series of decisions that Republicans would prefer to keep secret.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s clear \u2013 as we noted last October \u2013 that Ross lied under oath to Congress. As Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) pointed out in today\u2019s hearing, Ross said that he only added the citizenship question in December, 2017, after a request from the Department of Justice and a public comment period.\n\nBut a letter Ross wrote seven months earlier, in May 2017, said that he had already requested the question be added. That makes the entire public process a sham, and means that Ross\u2019s underlings violated the APA by falsifying the record.\n\nAnd there are numerous other examples. Ross lied under oath about his meetings with White House advisors Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach, both ardent nationalists. DOJ officials lied about the influence of Hofeller, covered up their conversations about changing census confidentiality rules to share data with ICE, and lied about the chain of events leading up to the proposed change.\n\nMost importantly, it\u2019s now abundantly clear that the proffered rationale for the question \u2013 to aid in the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act \u2013 is pure pretext. (If nothing else, it\u2019s quite bizarre that officials who have opposed the VRA are now so committed to enforcing it.) The real rationale is right there in the Hofeller memos: to dilute the power of non-white communities by omitting non-citizens from congressional district apportionment.\n\nThat would fly in the face of 230 years of American tradition (after all, women were counted before they could vote, and children are still counted today). And it would advantage \u201cnon-Hispanic whites.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the citizenship question would intimidate Hispanics is just the icing on the cake.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nFirst, despite Republican protestations, it\u2019s unlikely that the contempt vote \u2013 even if it passes the full House \u2013 will influence the Supreme Court. They are separate procedures, different factual issues, and different legal standards. (Indeed, Contempt of Congress, like Contempt of Court, is so vague that it barely has a standard at all.) While the Court may take official notice of the contempt finding, it has no legal relevance to the case.\n\nSecond, the White House\u2019s eleventh-hour attempt to shield the documents in question under the banner of executive privilege is also unlikely to have much impact. The documents were not privileged in the months that Ross and Barr refused to turn them over, which according to the Oversight Committee demonstrated contempt of Congress.\n\nNor is the privilege claim likely to survive judicial review. The declaration was a transparent attempt to shield embarrassing or incriminating documents from Congress. There\u2019s no plausible rationale for why they should be covered by executive privilege. If anything, the tactic merely begs the question of, in Rep. Cummings\u2019 words, \u201cwhat are they hiding?\u201d\n\nSo the next move lies with the House as a whole.\n\nPerhaps, as in the Mueller case, House leaders could use the contempt resolution as leverage to compel Ross and Barr to comply with the Oversight Committee\u2019s subpoenas.\n\nOr, if such compliance is not forthcoming, the House could find the two in contempt. Doing so is not unprecedented, or even unusual; Attorney General Eric Holder was found in contempt of Congress in 2016 in connection with investigations into DOJ\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d program. And Bush White House Counsel Harriet Miers was found in contempt of Congress in 2007 in connection with the administration\u2019s mass firing of U.S. attorneys.\n\nNeither of those votes resulted in the resignations of the officials involved, let alone Presidents Obama or Bush. But they did move forward both of the investigations. Conceivably, if two Trump cabinet secretaries are found in contempt of Congress, the same might happen here.\n\nWho knows, maybe the government will even catch up with the dead guy.", "description": "House panel finds William Barr and Wilbur Ross in contempt for refusing to turn over key documents about a plot to rig the census, which was found on a deceased man\u2019s hard drive.", "authors": ["Jay Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1560373407/190612-michaelson-gop-tease_ufvhnx", "published_at": "2019-06-12"}
