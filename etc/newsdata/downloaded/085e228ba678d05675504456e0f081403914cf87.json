While he has been on the injured list four times this season because of his chronically painful right knee, he had never publicly discussed his shoulder ailment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been something that we\u2019ve been trying to deal with the past couple months. Thought that we had a pretty good handle on it,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cI threw in that game in Tampa, and it felt pretty good, but I woke up a couple days later, and it was pretty sore.\u201d\n\nSabathia hopes to be able to pitch in the AL Championship Series if the Yankees advance.\n\n\u201cHe ended up getting a cortisone shot, was able to go out and throw in a sim game Tuesday and, frankly, threw the ball pretty well,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said, \u201cbut just not quite where it needs to be, to be in the kind of role we\u2019re going to ask him to be in where he\u2019s potentially getting up on the spot and then maybe having to get up later in the game.\u201d\n\nSabathia was 5-8 with a 4.95 ERA, leaving his career record at 251-161 with 3,093 strikeouts.\n\n\u201cI do feel like the longer we go, it\u2019s a better chance that I can get back out there,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "CC Sabathia will be watching the AL Division Series from the dugout, unable to contribute from the New York Yankees bullpen because of a sore left shoulder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/alds_yankees_baseball_14097_c0-173-4134-2583_s1770x1032.jpg?31567053fe3eeb4dd344d1eb822dceb6284ba7c5"}
