It's Flynn's lawyers latest attempt to get the case thrown out.\n\nSidney Powell, Flynn\u2019s attorney, filed a 37-page motion on Thursday, outlining several big allegations, once again requesting the government produce all evidence as it relates to Flynn \u2014 urging the court to \u201cdismiss the entire prosecution for outrageous government misconduct\u201d and hold the prosecutors in contempt.\n\nFLYNN LAWYER WANTS PROSECUTORS TO TURN OVER CELLPHONES FROM MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR LINKED TO RUSSIA PROBE\n\nThe entire case stemmed from that FBI interview where Flynn was asked about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding those conversations during his interview, as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut as his legal team goes on offense in the long-running and still unresolved court proceedings, Powell alleged that FBI officials manipulated Flynn\u2019s FBI 302 \u2014 a form used by agents to report or summarize interviews. It's not clear who may have done the alleged editing, though ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok was involved in the original interview.\n\n\u201cThose changes added an unequivocal statement that \u2018Flynn stated he did not\u2019 \u2014 in response to whether Mr. Flynn had asked Kislyak to vote in a certain manner or slow down the UN vote [on sanctions],\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThis is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on the issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.\u201d\n\nPowell also alleged that agents added: \u201cor if Kislyak described any Russian response to a request by Flynn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat question and answer does not appear in the notes, yet it was made into a criminal offense,\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThe draft also shows that the agents moved a sentence to make it seem to be an answer to a question it was not.\u201d\n\nPowell also raised concerns about text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page days following the publication of the salacious anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie.\n\nAs the coverage of the dossier spread in the media, the filing said, \"Strzok wrote to Page: \u2018Sitting with Bill watching CNN. A TON more out\u2026We\u2019re discussing whether, now that this is out, we can use it as a pretext to go interview some people.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the next two weeks, there were \u2018many meetings\u2019 between Strzok and [former Deputy FBI Director Andrew] McCabe to discuss \u2018whether to interview National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and if so, what interview strategies to use,\u2019\u201d the document continued.\n\nPowell alleged that on Jan. 23, 2017 \u2013 the day before the FBI interviewed Flynn at the White House \u2013 \u201cthe upper echelon of the FBI met to orchestrate\u201d strategies that would have Flynn talk \u201cin such a way as to keep from alerting him from understanding that he was being interviewed in a criminal investigation of which he was the target.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, they planned to deceive him about the entire scenario, and keep him \u2018unguarded,\u2019\u201d Powell claimed.\n\nPowell went on to allege that, at former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s direction, McCabe \u201cpersonally called Flynn to pave the way for the uncounseled conversation.\u201d\n\nWhile saying \"Comey and McCabe were executing their own agenda\u2014not investigating a crime,\" she continued to claim the government is hiding evidence \"of the original 302, other exculpatory texts, and other forms of information completely.\u201d\n\nWhether the combative filings will persuade the court in a case where Flynn has already pleaded guilty remains to be seen.\n\nProsecutors have strongly rejected claims they're hiding evidence, saying \"the government has exceeded its discovery and disclosure obligations in this matter,\" including by providing Flynn with thousands of pages of documents.\n\nFederal prosecutors earlier this month called the defense's filings a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of their involvement, the defendant\u2019s new counsel, have sought to get the charges dropped, professed their client\u2019s actual innocence, and perpetuated conspiracy theories, all while stating that the defendant does not intend to withdraw his guilty plea,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBut Powell is also hammering the FBI and DOJ over media leaks, citing a text message from Strzok to Page in April 2017: \u201cI had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you I want to talk to you about media leak strategy with DOJ before you go.\u201d\n\nPowell also referenced a purported conversation between former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Washington Post reporter David Ignatius, claiming Clapper told the reporter \u201cwords to the effect of 'take the kill shot on Flynn,'\u201d after he reportedly obtained the transcript of Flynn\u2019s phone calls.\n\nA spokesman for Clapper, though, told Fox News that he \"absolutely did not say those words to David Ignatius.\"\n\n\"It's absolutely false,\" the spokesman said. \"It's absurd.\"\n\nIgnatius did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nPowell also claims that the official who leaked the transcripts of the calls to Ignatius was a Pentagon official who was Stefan Halper\u2019s \u201chandler.\u201d\n\nHalper, an American professor, has been widely reported as a confidential source for the FBI during the bureau\u2019s original investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Halper, in 2016, contacted several members of the Trump campaign including former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and former aides Carter Page and Sam Clovis.\n\n\u201cThe evidence the defense requests will eviscerate any factual basis for the plea and reveal the conduct so outrageous\u2014if there is not enough already\u2014to mandate dismissal of this prosecution for egregious government misconduct,\u201d Powell wrote.\n\nAlso in the filing, Powell referenced U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, who accepted Flynn\u2019s guilty plea just days before he was \u201csuddenly and inexplicably recused.\u201d\n\nFox News reported last year that Contreras and Strzok had a personal relationship, according to text messages obtained.\n\n\u201cThe government knew that well in advance of Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea that Judge Contreras was a friend of Peter Strzok and his recusal was even discussed in an exchange of multiple texts,\u201d Powell wrote, referencing text messages between Strzok and Page where they discussed Strzok and Contreras speaking \u201cin detail\u201d on anything \u201cmeaningful enough to warrant recusal.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Strzok and Page did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nPowell\u2019s filing is just the latest in a series of motions brought to the court on behalf of Flynn. Last week, Powell demanded federal prosecutors turn over two cellphones used by Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, whose role in the Trump-Russia investigation has long been shrouded in mystery.\n\nPowell\u2019s defense of Flynn has caused an escalating battle with the government, with Flynn\u2019s sentencing still up in the air for his guilty plea. The government said in late August that the case was ready for sentencing, after months of delay. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Dec. 18 sentencing date, though it\u2019s unclear whether it could be pushed off again.", "description": "An explosive new court filing from\u00a0Michael Flynn\u2019s legal team alleges that FBI agents\u00a0manipulated official\u00a0records of the former national security adviser\u2019s 2017 interview\u00a0that led to him being charged with lying to investigators\u2014in their latest attempt to get the case thrown out.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
