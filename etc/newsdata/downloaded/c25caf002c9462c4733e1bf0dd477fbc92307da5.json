I drew this on my hand and one on hers.\n\n\u2018We walked to school holding hands to charge them up and all the way she asked: \u201cIs it charged yet?\u201d\n\n\u2018When we reached her class I told her they were fully charged and to press it whenever she missed me and it would give her a magic hug from me and vice versa.\n\n\u2018Hey presto!!! She went in with no tears, just a kiss and a smile. She asked me when she came out how many times I pressed my magic button today and I said 10 times!!! She smiled and said \u201csame as me\u201d.\u2019\n\nMum Melissa spotted the trick online (Picture: Melissa Conlon)\n\nThe post racked up more than 15,000 comments and 44,000 shares with other parents vowing to start a hug button too.\n\nOne parent wrote: \u201dI love this idea!
