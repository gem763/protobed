She had a fall over here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe owner and the staff locked the door, they don't let anybody out and don't let any coaches in until they are paid. I\u2019d describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage.\u201d\n\nClaire Simpson, who was due to fly home to Manchester last night, told The Sun three coaches that arrived to take travellers to the airport were turned away by staff.\n\n\u201cLes Orangers have locked the gates to the hotel and are keeping people hostage,\u201d she said.\n\n\"They are claiming Thomas Cook hasn\u2019t paid them, so are demanding that we pay them.\u201d\n\nOther guests said staff had \u201cbarricaded the exits\u201d to prevent people leaving and switched off the WiFi.\n\nDominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, insisted their were contingency plans in place for if the company collapsed and that travellers would not be stranded abroad.\n\nBut he appeared lukewarm on the prospect of a government bailout for the firm, telling the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe would wait to see and hope that (Thomas Cook) can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we\u2019ve got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded.\u201d\n\nOne industry source cast doubt on the Government's repatriation plans, warning that spare aircraft were in short supply and that passengers would face major delays and could be \u201cturfed out\u201d of their rooms by hotel managers\n\n\u201c'This is a doomsday scenario, but you could see tourist hotspots effectively turned into refugee camps,\u201d they told the Mail on Sunday.\n\nA potential failure of Thomas Cook, which flirted with collapse eight years ago, will lead to questions about management\u2019s decision to pile new loans on the company\u2019s balance sheet despite going through a painful restructuring.\n\nTotal debt has risen to \u00a31.6bn from \u00a31.2bn in 2011. Since merging with MyTravel in 2007, the company has paid \u00a31.1bn in interest payments.\n\nStory continues", "description": "British holidaymakers have been \u201cheld hostage\u201d at a Tunisian resort over unpaid bills by Thomas Cook amid fears of its imminent collapse.", "authors": ["Victoria Ward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3PtSaWPlDu1FJ4ERB35SRg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/04c0d795d57e35c9a5cdb827bb01c0c4", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
