President Trump has called him a \u201ctraitor\u201d worthy of execution, while supporters have credited him with calling attention to and reforming the NSA\u2019s previously secretive surveillance apparatus.\n\n\u201cNo one becomes a whistleblower because they want to,\u201d Mr. Snowden told NPR. \u201cNo one becomes a whistleblower because it has a happy ending.\u201d\n\nMr. Snowden, a former CIA employee-turned-intelligence contractor, fled to Hong Kong prior to the first reports about the documents being published in June 2013. He was revealed as the source shortly afterward and charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and stealing government property, and the U.S. State Department subsequently canceled his passport.\n\nMr. Snowden managed to leave Hong Kong despite lacking a valid U.S. passport, but he soon became stranded when his flight landed in Moscow while effectively stateless. Russia granted him asylum weeks later and he has lived in the country ever since.\n\n\u201cIt was not my choice to be here, and this is what people forget. \u2026 It was not my choice to live in Russia,\u201d he told NPR.\n\nMr. Snowden said he has repeatedly taken aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin and his policies, rejecting claims that he has benefited the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly criticizing the Russian government\u2019s policy, the Russian government\u2019s human rights record, even the Russian president by name,\u201d Mr. Snowden told NPR. \u201cI had nothing to provide them. I have been criticizing the Russian government. What more can I do to satisfy you or any of these critics? There is nothing that will satisfy them. \u2026 It is their distrust of Russia.\u201d\n\nMr. Snowden faces a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment if found guilty of the charges unsealed against him.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately return a message request comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
