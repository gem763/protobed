It must also be noted that the final Young Rich List will value private companies considering as many meaningful metrics as possible - single valuation metrics were chosen for the SaaS and marketplace universes for indicative purposes in this research only.\n\nSuch elevated multiples do help explain why venture capitalists have recently put a price tag of $6.3 billion on expatriate Ori Allon's luxury property marketplace, Compass, and a $3.6 billion valuation on Canva, which straddles the SaaS sector with its corporate subscription product and marketplaces with its ever-expanding image library.\n\nDeputy's $308.60-per-share Series B was the sign of a genuine \"unicorn contender\", according to Amanda Hjorring, chief operating officer of Melbourne's Square Peg Capital, which backed the round alongside California's Institutional Venture Partners and the returning OpenView.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"With Deputy you've got amazing founders and a rostering system that's now in 90,000 workplaces and 80 countries, yet they feel they've only just touched the surface,\" Ms Hjorring told last week's Morgan Stanley Australia Summit in Sydney.\n\n\"The beauty of it is that it's a product-led sales business. It's viral among shift workers because it means they can easily communicate with each other and change rostering, and when they move jobs they take it with them, or at least show the new employer.\"\n\nDeputy could already be worth far more than the nominal $423 million indicated by last November's Series B.\n\nIt doubled revenue to $15.2 million in 2017-18 from $7.5 million the year before, according to accounts recently lodged with the corporate regulator.\n\nThe company did not provide a current revenue run rate for this article, but a doubling again to $30 million in 2018-19 would see Deputy valued at $561 million, applying the current trading of the Financial Review's SaaS universe.\n\nThe high marketplace multiples might have already made a unicorn out of Envato, founded in 2006 by Melburnian couple Collis and Cyan Ta'eed.\n\nIts EBITDA fell to $26 million in 2017-18 because of a large employee expense as it pivoted to its subscription-based Elements product. However, if the prior year's $36 million EBITDA could be considered a normalised result, the 28.47 times enterprise value to EBITDA ratio fetched by its marketplace peers would qualify it for a 10-digit valuation.", "description": "38-year-old Ashik Ahmed is set to debut in the top 20 of a Young Rich List that is on track to be richer than ever.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_117/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36919246dc77c46fcc33399a111bd6feb791b695", "published_at": "2019-06-10"}
