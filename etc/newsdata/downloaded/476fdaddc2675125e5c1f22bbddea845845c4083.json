We recognise the unique history and geography, I think to go back to my language of 10 August,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have to recognise that we are in the UK and sometimes I think people forget that.\u201d\n\nShe said her party was looking for a \u201csensible deal\u201d and it never wanted to inflict no deal on the region.\n\n\u201cThe presentation of the DUP as a \u2018no deal\u2019 party is wrong. People get very alarmed when they see that sort of rhetoric, We do want to see a deal but it has to be a deal that works for everybody,\u201d she said.\n\nThe backstop has the support of industry and farmers, who have said that no deal could have disastrous outcomes for Northern Ireland. The Stormont economy department has said it could cost 40,000 jobs.\n\nEchoing words of the party\u2019s chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson earlier this week, she said the solution lay in a joint letter she co-authored with the late leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, Martin McGuinness, in August 2016, a document rarely referred to by the DUP in the past two years.\n\nThe letter could be characterised as a plea for a soft Brexit. It envisaged a deal that would ensure new arrangements did not disrupt the peace process and accommodated the \u201cparticular significance for the agri-food sector and animal health\u201d in border regions.\n\nIt also noted it was critical that businesses were protected on the border and did not incur additional costs, suggesting the DUP could accept regulatory alignment if a Stormont assembly had a say in what EU rules would apply.\n\nIn a separate interview with RTE, Foster said the so-called Stormont lock \u2013 a promise to consult the Northern Ireland assembly on any no-deal arrangements \u2013 was being misrepresented as a veto on future EU regulations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for any control over the European Union, what we are looking for is control over what happens in Northern Ireland and I think that\u2019s a very fair thing to search for,\u201d she said.\n\nThe DUP is hoping a shift in its position will be met with a compromise by the EU and the Republic of Ireland.", "description": "Party leader indicates Brexit deal could include bespoke solution for the region", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca566b06b6d6f69228831583b8f108ac5c18eb21/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f746e202fd0f5c56c59c76fd9be2f9eb", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
