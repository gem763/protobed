Nelson added he would get water during the inning break.\n\nHouston led 2-0 when the game was delayed after the fourth inning while Kerwin Danley, who was at second base, went back to the umpires\u2019 locker room and changed into gear to work the plate.\n\nMark Carlson switched from third to second and Marvin Hudson from left field to third.\n\nYankees pitcher Luis Severino was given additional time to warm up again, and the game proceeded with a five-man crew and no left-field umpire.\n\nSix-man crews are the norm in the postseason, with a pair of outfield umpires added to the usual four.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Plate umpire Jeff Nelson left Game 3 of the AL Championship Series with a concussion after taking a pair of foul tips off the mask, causing a 16-minute delay at Yankee Stadium.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_90827_c0-118-2836-1772_s1200x700.jpg?5979620e2aa73d06b096d399f55f70baaad90e32", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
