The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more \u2014 a week on Cointelegraph in one link.\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has had us all in for a white-knuckle ride this week. Wednesday saw Bitcoin (BTC) crash $500 in a matter of minutes and sink to $7,500 \u2014 a five-month low. Saturday was a different story. At one point, BTC had realized massive gains of 36% on the day \u2014 taking the coin hurtling beyond $10,100. One commentator claimed it was the fourth-largest gain in Bitcoin\u2019s history, and the biggest daily gain since 2011. As ever, it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s behind the surge. Record trading volumes of Bakkt futures contracts may be one factor, and as we\u2019ll explore a little bit later, some words of encouragement from Chinese President Xi Jinping could have played a role too.\n\nSo, more on those comments from Xi Jinping \u2014 comments that may have proven catnip for the crypto markets. On Thursday, he called for China to accelerate its adoption of blockchain \u2014 and said doing so would be essential for technological innovation and transforming industries. Jinping cited clear direction on future strategy, as well as increased investment, as other ingredients for success. It is worth remembering here that Beijing is advocating blockchain here, not Bitcoin. A long-standing aversion to cryptocurrencies remains in China, where ICOs and crypto exchanges have been banned, and mining could follow next. Nonetheless, a Chinese central bank digital currency is in the works \u2014 bringing us very nicely on to our next guest.\n\nMark Zuckerberg headed to Washington, D.C. this week \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t for a nice, relaxing visit to the Smithsonian. Instead, the Facebook CEO faced six hours of questions from the United States Congress, predominantly from lawmakers who remain hostile to the social network\u2019s Libra stablecoin. The billionaire warned innovation is essential if America is going to remain a global financial leader, especially considering there\u2019s growing competition from China, where businesses \u201ccertainly don\u2019t share our values.\u201d Although his appearance in front of the House Financial Services Committee was meant to allow politicians to ask questions about Facebook, some Congress members used their allotted five minutes to criticize Zuckerberg instead. Rep. Brad Sherman was especially dismissive \u2014 and said cryptocurrencies either displace the U.S. dollar or cause investors to lose a lot of money. Overall, it seems very little has changed, meaning the impasse between Facebook and Washington will rumble on, prolonging the uncertainty about Libra\u2019s launch date. As the committee\u2019s chair, Rep. Maxine Waters, told Cointelegraph: \u201cAt this point, I am not a supporter of Libra. I don't know what it is, I don't think that that has been adequately explained.\u201d\n\nNew data this week revealed that a whopping $11 trillion in wealth has been transferred by Bitcoin since its blockchain went live a decade ago. According to crypto analyst PlanB, the network processes an average of about $9.6 billion per day. To put this all into perspective, PayPal\u2019s annual transaction volume was $578 billion across the whole of 2018 \u2014 meaning that, at this rate, it takes just two months for BTC to surpass it. In other developments, a survey by a financial services firm suggested that the number of Americans who own cryptocurrencies has almost doubled this year. Back in April, a report had suggested that BTC could overtake other global payment systems such as Visa and Mastercard a decade from now.\n\nWe\u2019ve been blocked for more than a month \u2014 but now, we\u2019re back on Facebook, baby. There was a lot of confusion surrounding why the block had gone into force. Although the social network has a staunch anti-crypto policy when it comes to paid advertisements, our page reports industry news \u2014 not the \u201cmisleading, fraudulent or deceptive\u201d information its company policy prohibits. Our page on Facebook-owned Instagram had also been unaffected throughout the incident. Alas, there\u2019s no point crying over spilt milk. A Facebook rep has told Cointelegraph that the page was unpublished in error, meaning it\u2019s now live again. Come and give us a like!\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $9.583.03, Ether at $184.15 and XRP at $0.30.

The company has ties to Bitfinex and other major cryptocurrency exchanges. Ivan Manuel Molina Lee is suspected of money laundering and being involved in an international drug cartel. He was subject to a European arrest warrant, and his detention was reportedly connected to $350 million previously seized by Poland\u2019s Ministry of Justice. Following the arrest, Bitfinex described itself as a \u201cvictim of a fraud\u201d \u2014 and fiercely rejected allegations that its exchange had laundered funds at Crypto Capital\u2019s request as \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\nAn unknown Bitcoin Cash (BCH) miner was apparently in control of more than 50% of the token\u2019s hash rate for 24 hours. Reaching this threshold runs the risk of them being able to dominate the entire network and do \u201cnefarious things.\u201d Some factions of Crypto Twitter cited the incident as a reason why BCH \u201cis a security risk and a liability\u201d \u2014 urging the coin to be delisted. Others have suggested that Bitcoin miners might be diverting their attention to BCH as an outlet for their otherwise useless levels of hashpower.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department official who prosecuted the infamous Silk Road case has warned that the fiat-dominated financial system is inept at tackling the very thing it purports to worry about when it comes to crypto. Andreessen Horowitz general partner Kathryn Haun claimed \u201c99.9% of all money laundering crimes go unprosecuted.\u201d Haun said that the financial services industry spends an estimated $20 billion a year on Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer checks \u2014 but questioned whether any of these measures are actually working.\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\nTwo of the largest crypto exchange markets in Asia are increasingly pressuring exchanges to delist privacy-focused crypto assets.
