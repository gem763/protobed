Uefa could now threaten Bulgaria with Euro 2020 expulsion.\n\nAfter facing monkey chants, Mings screamed at officials to intervene, shouting: \"Hey, did you hear that?\" The defender then discussed what he heard with Kane, who reported the abuse to the referee.\n\nIn unprecedented scenes for an England match, the first of a three-step Uefa protocol to tackle racist abuse was enacted. The Bulgarian fans were then warned over the stadium loudspeaker: \"Because of racist behaviour which is interfering with the game, the referee has indicated he may have to suspend the match. Please be in no doubt that the game may be suspended and abandoned if racist behaviour continues.\"\n\nThe game was then stopped for a second time shortly before half-time after a fresh round of abuse, but the players, staff and referee agreed not to enact the second protocol because the main culprits - a hooded gang identifying themselves as the Lauta Army, a hooligan linked to Lokomotiv Plovdiv - immediately walked out of the stadium.", "description": "England's players were commended for their tough and dignified response to racism after twice stopping their Euro 2020 qualifying match over abuse from Far Right Bulgarian hooligans.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace", "Keith Hackett", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213035772-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYGGZxE-BlFTHPG6FlsHtq44U3ydn9ifqeE_Egr1RiGk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
