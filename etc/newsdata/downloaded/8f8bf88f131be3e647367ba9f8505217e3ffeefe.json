Rights for people who dissolved children in acid? No way,' Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who heads the ruling 5-Star Movement, wrote on Facebook.\n\n'The history of our country has left us too much blood and pain. We will not look the other way.'\n\nItaly's tough prison regimes for mafia bosses and convicted terrorists who refuse to cooperate with the justice system violates human rights and needs to change (pictured: Salvatore 'the beast' Riina)\n\nThe court ruling focused specifically on the case of Marcello Viola, who was sentenced in 1999 to life imprisonment for several mafia-linked crimes, including murder.\n\nViola has never cooperated with the authorities or given information that might help other investigations, and for this reason he has never received any prison privileges, such as day passes, unlike many other long-time inmates.\n\nCritics of the tough regime told the ECHR that one of the main reasons why prisoners refused to cooperate was fear of retaliation against their families.\n\n'The court inferred from this that the lack of cooperation was not always the result of a free and deliberate choice,' the ECHR said in June, when it originally ruled in the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court refused to let Italy appeal the verdict, meaning Rome will now need to come up with measures to redress the rights violations. The ECHR made clear that despite its decision, it was not demanding the release of Viola.\n\nItalian magistrates say fear of unrelenting prison conditions is key to persuading mafiosi to become informers\n\nItalian magistrates say fear of unrelenting prison conditions is key to persuading mafiosi to become informers.\n\n'Only jail scares the mobsters,' anti-mafia magistrate Nino Di Matteo told daily newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano.\n\nItaly toughened jail conditions for mobsters and terrorists following the bloody struggles of the 1980s and the 1990s, which culminated with the murder of two top Sicilian anti-mafia magistrates, Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone, in 1992.\n\nFollowing the change to the law, large numbers of turncoats started cooperating with police, leading, amongst other things to the arrest of Salvatore 'the beast' Riina, who was convicted of ordering the killings of both Borsellino and Falcone.\n\nItaly toughened jail conditions for mobsters and terrorists following the bloody struggles of the 1980s and the 1990s (pictured: Salvatore Lo Piccolo shortly after his arrest)\n\nRiina always refused to cooperate with magistrates and died in jail in 2017, denied house arrest which is normally offered to terminally ill prisoners.\n\nThe decision of the ECHR, which has no connection with the European Union, angered right-wing nationalists, who complain that Italy has handed over too much sovereignty to European institutions.\n\n'Another act of madness against Italy from the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights', said Matteo Salvini, head of Italy's most popular party, the far-right League.
