The company complied.", "language": "en", "text": "Those websites and apps were back up as of Thursday.\n\nMarriott, the world\u2019s largest hotelier, has been aggressively expanding in China in recent years. It says it took down the survey \u201cimmediately\u201d and is doing a review of all of its materials, including its websites, according to a company spokeswoman. The Bethesda, Md.-based company is also taking disciplinary action against an employee who used a corporate Twitter account to \u201clike\u201d a post supporting Tibetan independence from China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMarriott International respects and supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,\u201d chief executive Arne Sorenson wrote in a statement on the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t support anyone who subverts the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and we do not intend in any way to encourage or incite any such people or groups,\u201d he added. \u201cWe recognize the severity of the situation and sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nMarriott is among a growing number of companies that have been publicly targeted by the Chinese government for listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate countries. Delta Air Lines and Zara in recent weeks have also amended their websites \u2014 and issued public apologies \u2014 under pressure from China.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was an inadvertent error with no business or political intention, and we apologize for the mistake,\u201d Susannah Thurston, a spokeswoman for Delta said in an email. Calling China \u201cone of our most important markets,\u201d Thurston said that \u201cwe are fully committed to China and our Chinese customers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA number of major companies, including Apple and Audi, have acquiesced to China\u2019s censorship laws and other demands in recent years, experts said. Apple last year removed messaging and VPN apps, which would allow users to bypass government-imposed firewalls, from its Chinese app store. Audi, meanwhile, apologized for using in a presentation a map of China that did not include Taiwan and parts of Tibet.\n\nHong Kong and Macau are officially part of China, although they have their own governments and political systems. (Traveling between Hong Kong, Macau and China requires a passport.) Tibet is ruled by China, although some Tibetans argue that it is an independent country that is illegally occupied.\n\nAD\n\nTaiwan, meanwhile, has its own democracy and maintains that it is an independent nation. China, however, claims it as a province.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis kind of policing has been going on for a long time, but it used to be handled much more discretely,\u201d said Sean Miner, a fellow at the Atlantic Council who specializes in China. \u201cNow, though, China is overtly using its economic leverage to publicly shame companies that it believes are crossing the line.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese market is an increasingly important one for Marriott, which is working hard to woo the country\u2019s growing middle class. It has opened more than 240 hotels \u2014 many of them high-end resorts \u2014 in China over the past five years as it looks to familiarize a growing population of jet-setters with the 91-year-old brand.\n\nAD\n\nThe company has more than 300 hotels in China, about five times what it did in 2012. And those properties are increasingly lucrative. During the first nine months of 2017, Marriott said, revenue per available room, a key industry metric, rose 8.4 percent in Greater China, compared with 1.5 percent in North America and 2.6 percent worldwide.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cChina is the biggest single market for us outside the U.S.,\u201d Sorenson said at an industry conference in June. \u201cWe\u2019re opening in excess of one [hotel] a week in China.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Chinese government has shut down the hotelier's site as punishment for listing Hong Kong and Taiwan as stand-alone countries.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GZAofTA7kghAOcVW0oLrk0vEHzU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L47GHKJICU75NKMGTNVLOZKRTM.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-18"}
