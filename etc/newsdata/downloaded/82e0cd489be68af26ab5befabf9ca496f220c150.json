But what happens when they have to choose between the two? The University of California apparently wants to find out.\n\nThe system said last week that its $13.4 billion endowment will sell all fossil-fuel assets by the end of September, and its $70 billion pension fund will soon do the same. Students have been lobbying administrators to divest for years, and this summer 77% of faculty in the Academic Senate voted in support of divestment.\n\nDianne Klein, the chief of staff at UC Investments, said the system\u2019s decision was \u201cnot politically motivated\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t use the term divest\u201d because \u201cthat term has political implications.\u201d Sure, and climate change isn\u2019t at all political these days.\n\nWriting in the Los Angeles Times, the university system\u2019s chief investment officer and treasurer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, and board of regents chairman, Richard Sherman, insisted that \u201changing on to fossil fuel assets is a financial risk\u201d and such investments \u201cposed a long-term risk to generating strong returns for UC\u2019s diversified portfolios.\u201d\n\nActuaries see it differently. \u201cWhile green tech advocates may be able to cherry pick individual years when green energy has recently outperformed fossil fuels, the long view shows the opposite,\u201d the consulting firm Foster & Foster concluded this year in a report commissioned by a union concerned that New York\u2019s public pension funds will divest. It found that between 2008 and 2018 fossil-fuel investments delivered an average annual return of 2.6%, while the green energy funds yielded minus-3.94%.\n\nDivestment is also costly, said Arizona State University finance professor Hendrik Bessembinder in a 2016 report commissioned by the Independent Petroleum Association of America. Selling off illiquid long-term assets is expensive, and university endowments would have to scrap investments in mutual funds or commingled funds that have fossil-fuel holdings.\n\nUC\u2019s Ms. Klein says comingled funds with fossil-fuel assets are \u201ca very small percentage\u201d of UC\u2019s investments. But Mr. Bessembinder also found that \u201csince there is no well-defined and agreed-upon list of assets that are fossil-fuel-related, investment managers must undertake a degree of active management in order to maintain compliance with divestment goals.\u201d These frictional expenses would cost a typical large university endowment $1.4 billion to $7.4 billion over 20 years, he estimated.\n\nThe real risk of investing in fossil fuels is from politicians. Solar, geothermal, wind, biomass and hydroelectric together accounted for a mere 11% of U.S. energy consumption in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration. Yet Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris want to ban shale drilling for natural gas that has reduced carbon emissions.\n\nBy the way, divestment won\u2019t appease green activists. While it\u2019s \u201ca huge victory for our movement,\u201d Fossil Free UC\u2019s Berkeley chapter said, \u201cour work is not done.\u201d The group now wants the university system to reject all funding from the fossil-fuel industry. Tuition and taxpayers will have to cover what endowments, pension funds and donations can\u2019t.", "description": "Giving up higher investment returns for climate-change piety.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109698/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
