Oil prices slip again amid gathering gloom over global economy * Brent, WTI benchmarks fell more than 5% last week\n\n* Middle East tensions linger, deadly clashes in Iraqi\n\nunrest\n\n* U.S.-China trade talks to focus minds later in week\n\n\n\nBy Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday,\n\nextending last week's heavy losses, with traders fearing the\n\nglobal economic slowdown will weigh on future oil demand growth\n\nwhile pegging hopes for a rebound on progress in talks this week\n\non ending the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nBrent crude futures edged down 24 cents to $58.13 a\n\nbarrel by 0147 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\ncrude was at $52.69, down 12 cents.\n\nBoth contracts ended last week with a more-than-5% decline\n\nafter dismal manufacturing data from the United States and\n\nChina, as the lingering row between the world's top economies\n\nhurts global growth and raises the risk of recession.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington on Oct.\n\n10-11 in the next, much-anticipated fresh effort to work out a\n\ndeal.\n\nOn the supply side, a faster-than-expected resumption in\n\nSaudi Arabia's production after a Sept. 14 attack on key\n\nproduction facilities also exerted downward pressure on oil\n\nprices, although the Middle East remained tense. In Iraq, the second-largest producer among the Organization\n\nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries, deadly anti-government\n\nunrest is posing the biggest security and political challenge so\n\nfar to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's year-old government.\n\nGlobal supply also faces facility repair and maintenance\n\npressures.\n\nThe Buzzard oil field in the British North Sea has been shut\n\nfor pipe repair work, a spokesman from China's CNOOC said on\n\nFriday. Buzzard is the main contributor to the Forties crude\n\nstream, the largest of the five North Sea oil grades that\n\nunderpin Brent crude futures.\n\nMeanwhile Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on\n\nSunday it will close the Faregh oil field at Zueitina port for\n\nscheduled maintenance from Monday until Oct. 14.\n\nOil prices slip again amid gathering gloom over global economy", "description": "Oil prices slip again amid gathering gloom over global economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7405M_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
