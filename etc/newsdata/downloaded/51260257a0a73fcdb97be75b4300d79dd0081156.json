Lee also covered one eye during his entrance to the tournament, an apparent show of support for a nurse who was hit in the eye with a beanbag during a recent protest in Kowloon.\n\nWhile a recent Hearthstone tournament quickly cut away from a similar on-stream show of support for Hong Kong protesters, the Mythic Championship broadcast didn't edit Lee's statements or stop him short in any way. And while Blizzard quickly punished Ng \"Blitzchung\" Wai Chung for similar statements after a Hearthstone tournament win earlier this month, there has thus far been no indication from Magic owner Wizards of the Coast that Lee will receive any official sanction for his statement (a representative for Wizards of the Coast was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment from Ars).\n\nTo the contrary, Magic esports Twitch chat moderator Ian Dixon noted on Twitter that \"mods actually had instructions to *allow and not touch* any and all of those kinds of mentions of [Hong Kong].\" That forms a stark contrast to the situation in Hearthstone tournaments, where Blizzard has recently started handing out 24 hour suspensions to Twitch chatters that express support for Hong Kong during matches.\n\nBlizzard said earlier this month that \"the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome... we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.\" But that was before a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sent a letter urging Blizzard to reconsider their stance , expressing worry about \"the Chinese government's growing appetite for pressuring American businesses to help stifle free speech.\"\n\nBlizzard also recently cancelled a planned promotional event at the Nintendo World NYC store and faces planned protests at next month's Blizzcon fan gathering over its stance on this issue.", "description": "Lee receives no sanction, in contrast to Blizzard's Hearthstone crackdowns.", "authors": ["Kyle Orland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mtghongkong-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
