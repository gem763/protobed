The percentage of Gen Xers and baby boomers with a side hustle is slightly lower, coming in at 39% and 28%, respectively.\n\nSide hustlers make an average of $1,122 per month from their part-time work. That\u2019s up from $686 last year. And approximately 40% of millennials who do work a job on the side say that gig brings in half of their monthly income.\n\nWhy American workers are hustling\n\n\u201cA lot of people are working side hustles because even though the economy is strong, wages are stagnant,\u201d Amanda Dixon, an analyst at Bankrate, told MarketWatch. \u201cFor a lot of Americans, expenses are rising, but there are no raises at work.\u201d\n\nThe average hourly earnings of private non-farm employees sat at $27.77 in April 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That same month, the Bureau put the average hourly earnings growth rate at 3.2% per year. But that percentage isn\u2019t adjusted for inflation or changes to the costs of living. When those variables are factored into the calculation, real wages have shrunk by 0.8% over the past 12 months and by 9% since 2006, according to PayScale.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The No. 1 reason you\u2019re still broke even if you received a pay raise last year\n\nFor millennials, a need to pay off student debt and a desire to have more disposable income are also common motivations for taking on additional jobs, Dixon said.\n\n\u201cMillennials want extra money for experiences and travel,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cAnd most haven\u2019t reached the peak earning point in their careers yet, so a side hustle can allow them to have financial stability while also being able to do more of what they want.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the case for Josh Seefried. The 33-year-old Arlington, Virginia, resident graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 2009. After eight years of serving, he left the Air Force to start a yachting company.\n\nThe only issue is that the job is part-time. Seefried decided to take on a bartending job on the side to earn some extra money.\n\n\u201cIt gives me extra comfort,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Seefried rents, lives with his partner and doesn\u2019t have kids. He could pay all of his basic expenses with his yachting company, but the additional $2,000 a month that bartending brings in adds to his sense of financial security.\n\nA lot of his friends, millennials who graduated college right around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, also have side hustles or simply work multiple part-time jobs.\n\n\u201cWith the crash, our generation has already been stripped of the idea that you can sit in a corporation for 20 years and get a pension. None of us believe that anymore, so we\u2019d rather do what we actually want to do in life,\u201d Seefried said.\n\nFor Seefried and many millennials, that often means spending money on travel.\n\n\u201cI could go get a successful job in a corporation, but I\u2019d rather chase travel and experiences and make ends meet in a bunch of different ways than work a corporate job that\u2019s only going to let me travel two weeks a year,\u201d Seefried said. \u201cWe just have different values as a generation.\u201d\n\nFrom crafting to child care: what gig workers are doing\n\nSide gigs include everything from working as a bartender like Seefried to running online blogs or social media accounts. The most common side hustles in 2018 were home repair and landscaping, selling products online, crafts, and child care, according to Bankrate.\n\n\u201cI was a little surprised Uber and Lyft weren\u2019t on there, but I think that may change,\u201d Dixon said.\n\nThough Uber UBER, +0.21% and Lyft LYFT, +0.99% didn\u2019t make it onto the list, many side hustlers, including 84% of millennials who work extra jobs, say technology plays a role in how they get their additional income.\n\n\u201cTechnology has really changed the game for people wanting to enter this side job gig economy,\u201d Dixon said. It\u2019s allowing side hustlers not only to sell products online but also to market their services to a larger audience through the internet.\n\nSome make the leap from part-time to full-time\n\nMost people with a side job are doing it to get a bit more money in their bank account. But 27% of side hustlers actually prefer their part-time gig to their primary job, according Bankrate.\n\nFor these individuals, the goal can often be to turn their hustle into their career, and some have seen success.\n\nDFinney Photography Nicaila Matthews Okome of Washington, D.C. turned her side gig into a full-time career.\n\nNicaila Matthews Okome, a 35-year-old Washington, D.C., resident, started blogging while looking for a full-time job after finishing graduate school.\n\n\u201cI was getting a lot of rejections, and I started my side hustle as an outlet for me to affirm myself,\u201d she told MarketWatch.\n\nWhen her blog began to gain traction, she launched a podcast called Side Hustle Pro with the goal of spotlighting black female entrepreneurs.\n\nToday, producing the podcast \u2014 which she says has received almost two million downloads to date and has paid advertisers \u2014 and coaching others on how they can start their own successful podcasts make up her full-time job. \u201cI teach emerging podcasters to launch, scale, and monetize their podcast,\u201d she said.\n\nThough many would like to turn their side hustles into their careers, Dixon warns that it\u2019s not always possible.\n\n\u201cSelling things on Etsy ETSY, +4.20% may not be as lucrative as one might hope, and you may still need income from two jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nThe downsides\n\nDespite the benefits of additional income, side hustles often come with risks and complications that many overlook.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working part-time, you often don\u2019t have protections and could get injured,\u201d Dixon said.\n\nBecause side hustlers typically aren\u2019t full-time employees, they\u2019re generally not protected by anti-discrimination laws and in some cases, they may not be eligible for worker\u2019s compensation if they get injured on the job. And part-time workers usually don\u2019t qualify for company benefits such like health insurance and retirement savings plans.", "description": "Side hustlers make $1,122 per month on average from their part-time work \u2014 up from $686 last year, according to Bankrate.", "authors": ["James Wellemeyer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HK972_barten_ZG_20190606220715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
