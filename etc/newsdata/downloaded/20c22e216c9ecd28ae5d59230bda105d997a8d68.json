Though she was wearing a crash helmet, her hair came loose and got stuck in one of the wheels. Her scalp was ripped nearly clean off her skull.\n\n\u201cI felt a tug. I took the helmet off, untied my seatbelt and got up. I was bleeding. I was in shock and started screaming,\u201d she told local media.\n\nShe was rushed to Restauracion Hospital, where she\u2019s since spent a total of more than 15 hours in reconstructive surgery, which included hair and skin grafts.\n\nSurgeons were able to replace 80% of the ripped-off scalp and hair. She now faces a long recovery that could take up to two years.\n\nThe Walmart centre where the race was held, issued a statement: \u201cWe regret this and are in contact with the family to provide the victim with the necessary assistance.\u201d\n\nBefore the accident, Debora had long hair that hung past her hips.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t seem as if the incident will be investigated.\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "Brazilian teen D\u00e9bora Oliveira was taking part in a go-cart race in Boa Viagem, in Recife, when the accident happened.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9319/dfcdbcff3dfc4c9ba9692b3a8d57ebc6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
