(AP) - For the first time since coach Kyle Shanahan took over in San Francisco in 2017, the 49ers have a winning record.\n\nAfter losing 10 straight games to open Shanahan\u2019s first season in 2017 and a 1-7 start last year, the 49ers came out fast in a season-opening 31-17 victory at Tampa Bay on Sunday.\n\nIt all started with a defense that struggled to take the ball away at all last season generating four turnovers, including two interception returns for touchdowns. The three interceptions surpassed last year\u2019s total of two that set a record for futility.\n\n\u201cAs long as we went last year with that, I can tell you the longer we went last year without interceptions and stuff last year the harder it got. It became a burden on everybody nonstop,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cTo open up this year and beat our interceptions from last year in one game, we\u2019re not proud of last year at all, but we\u2019re proud we could beat that right away and move on from that.\u201d\n\nThe special teams delivered a deflected punt by Mark Nzeocha to set up a score on the opening drive. The offense did just enough in Jimmy Garoppolo\u2019s first game back after a season-ending knee injury last September.\n\nIt added up to San Francisco\u2019s first road win since 2017 and first win in the Eastern time zone since 2014, ending a 12-game slide.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe Niners hoped an upgraded edge rush with Dee Ford and No. 2 overall pick Nick Bosa would help turn around a defense that had just seven takeaways last year. The early results were positive.\n\nBosa and Ford each had sacks as San Francisco got three, and put consistent pressure on Jameis Winston. That helped generate some errant passes that led to the three interceptions, including ones returned for TDs by Richard Sherman and Ahkello Witherspoon.\n\n\u201cIt kind of becomes contagious,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cJust like not getting them can be contagious, so can getting them.\u201d\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nGaroppolo looked tentative at times in his first game in nearly a year. He completed 18 of 27 passes for just 166 yards. He mostly worked underneath, completing one pass that traveled at least 15 yards downfield, a 39-yard TD pass to Richie James Jr. He threw incompletions on his other four passes that traveled at least 15 yards and also threw an interception that Vernon Hargreaves returned for a TD.\n\n\u201cHe had a number of good things, just like the rest of the offense,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we were very consistent and we missed too many opportunities. I think we\u2019ll be better next week.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nWitherspoon. Opposing quarterbacks spent much of last season avoiding Sherman\u2019s side of the field and picking on Witherspoon on the defense\u2019s right side. That strategy proved successful and dealt a blow to Witherspoon\u2019s confidence following an impressive rookie season. Witherspoon held his own against Tampa Bay\u2019s pass offense and sealed the win with his 25-yard return for a score late in the fourth quarter.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nWR Dante Pettis. After having a strong finish to his rookie season, Pettis was expected to be a major part of San Francisco\u2019s passing offense this year. But he had an inconsistent training camp that frustrated Shanahan, and dealt with a groin injury that sidelined him for a week this summer. That led to Pettis playing only two snaps Sunday, catching one pass for 7 yards. Pettis was a full participant in practice Thursday and Friday and wasn\u2019t on the injury report, making this a decision based more on production than health.\n\n\u201cHe should have been in more than that,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThat starts with me and I need to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nRB Tevin Coleman was diagnosed with a high ankle sprain after an MRI on Monday. Coleman is listed as week to week and the Niners might need to add a third halfback to the roster alongside Matt Breida and Raheem Mostert. The most likely in-house candidate is preseason standout Jeff Wilson Jr., who is on the practice squad.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n6.4 - Garoppolo\u2019s average pass traveled just 6.4 yards downfield, the second-lowest mark in his nine career starts for San Francisco. That\u2019s down significantly from his average of 8.9 yards over the past two seasons.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe 49ers will spend the week in Youngstown, Ohio, preparing for Sunday\u2019s game at Cincinnati rather than head back to California in between Eastern time zone games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the first time since coach Kyle Shanahan took over in San Francisco in 2017, the 49ers have a winning record.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/49ers_buccaneers_football_22216_c0-215-5144-3214_s1770x1032.jpg?14d5640a0fea3fdfac1063acd829ac7259ddfadd", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
