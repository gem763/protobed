Once again, the president has kept his promise to create \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d The August jobs report showed a whopping 6.3 million jobs have been created during his administration. Notably, the record jobs figures delivered something for everyone: women, Hispanics, African Americans, African American females, and blue-collar workers alike \u2014 and that\u2019s bound to drive the left crazy in 2020.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report.\n\nWomen\u2019s participation in the workforce rose to 76.3 percent \u2014 the highest level since 2002.\n\nHispanic unemployment remains at a record low.\n\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans fell to a historic low.\n\nAmericans also saw bigs gains in their wages. Pay grew 3.2 percent year-over-year, achieving 3 percent growth for the 13th consecutive month. American workers haven\u2019t seen wage increases like this since 2009, shortly after President Obama was elected.\n\nMoreover, wage gains occurred most in the areas of the working class, versus gains for management.\n\nOverall labor participation rose, to 63.2 percent.\n\nAugust also marked the 18th consecutive month that unemployment registered at or below four percent. It remains at a 50-year low, making it the most impressive jobs rebound in half a century.\n\nLastly, the report made August the 107th consecutive month of job gains in the United States. It is quite a delivery on a campaign pledge to bring jobs back to America, from a president who is constantly badgered about his trade war with China as well as the ups and downs of the market on any given day.\n\nNevertheless, critics pounced right away.\n\nNational Public Radio called all of the above job gains \u201ctepid.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch reported it as, \u201cMeh.\u201d\n\nAnd CNN set off alarm bells with its headline, \u201cHiring slows.\u201d\n\nCritics suggest the jobs report didn\u2019t deliver as \u201cbigly\u201d as the president expected for August, though it only fell short by roughly 30,000 jobs but it\u2019s arguably a negligible difference.\n\nThey also point out that manufacturing contracted (although only slightly) and that business capital sits on the sidelines awaiting the president\u2019s (or China\u2019s) next move on trade, a battle he didn\u2019t start yet wants to be the first president to finish.\n\nPresident Trump continues to find himself under attack by establishment Wall Street analysts \u2014 the same analysts who predicted that a dangerous stock market crash and subsequent global contagion would surely come within days of Trump\u2019s inauguration (something that never happened).\n\nRather than asking why jobs fell a bit short in one summer month, the better question is why is the Wall Street establishment is rooting so hard against him \u2014 and by extension, all of you?\n\nA Hillbilly Elegy 2.0, if you will.\n\nAfter all, a new survey shows that 51.2 percent of Americans now say they feel confident about jobs being \u201cplentiful\u201d while overall consumer confidence remains at a 19-year high \u2014 the highest it\u2019s been since September 2000. The last time American consumers felt this good about the U.S. economy was back when Bill Clinton was still president and Gov. George W. Bush was running against Vice President Al Gore in a contest that wasn\u2019t yet settled.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s jobs delivery alone is nothing short of impressive. After 18 consecutive months of job gains, 50-year record-low unemployment and economic gains for everyone from African Americans to Hispanics to blue-collar workers, the president has a lot of reasons to be proud. In terms of \u201cpromises made, promises kept,\u201d economic gains alone ought to earn him victory in November 2020.\n\nJen Kerns (@JenKernsUSA) is the founder of Women for a Great America, a group dedicated to educating and engaging women on civic issues.
