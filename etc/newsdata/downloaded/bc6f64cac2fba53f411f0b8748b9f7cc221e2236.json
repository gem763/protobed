Photo: Barbara Alper/Getty Images\n\nThe nation\u2019s top retailer, Walmart, is a bit of a red-state cultural symbol, in part because of its prominence in small-town America and in part thanks to its conservative business practices \u2014 including hostility to unions and an unwillingness to offer socialistic things like health insurance to many of its \u201cassociates,\u201d i.e., its employees. The chain has always sold firearms and ammunition, though it stopped selling assault rifles and (except in Alaska) handguns in 2015. Now, after two fatal shootings at its stores \u2014 one in Mississippi in July and the deadlier and more notorious tragedy in El Paso in August \u2014 Walmart is further restricting its involvement in the guns-and-ammo trade, as CNN reports:\n\nThe company, America\u2019s largest retailer, said it will stop selling handgun ammunition and ammunition commonly used in assault-style weapons after selling all of its current inventory. Walmart (WMT) will also stop selling handguns in Alaska, the only state where it still sells handguns. And Walmart will request that customers no longer openly carry guns into its 4,700 U.S. stores, or its Sam\u2019s Club stores, in states that allow open carry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a memo to employees on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Walmart will continue to sell long-barrel deer rifles and shotguns and much of the ammunition for those guns. Walmart will also continue to allow concealed carry by customers with permits in its stores.\n\nIt\u2019s in ammo sales that Walmart has been a really big contributor to the lethal-force industry, and that will change, to a degree, at least:\n\nWalmart represents about 2 percent of the market for guns today, the company said for the first time recently. Walmart believes it is not among the top-three gun sellers in the industry, but it estimates it has about a 20 percent market share of ammunition sales.\n\nOn Tuesday, McMillon said that Walmart\u2019s changes to ammunition policies will reduce its market share from around 20 percent to between 6 percent and 9 percent. \u201cWe believe it will likely drift toward the lower end of that range, over time, given the combination of these changes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe memo in which Walmart announced these policy changes was jam-packed with \u201cto be sure\u201d language cushioning the blow to those customers who may think the company has gone all PC:\n\nWe know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand. As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same. Our remaining assortment will be even more focused on the needs of hunting and sport-shooting enthusiasts. It will include long-barrel deer rifles and shotguns, much of the ammunition they require, as well as hunting and sporting accessories and apparel \u2026\n\nAs it relates to safety in our stores, there have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers. We have also had well-intentioned customers acting lawfully that have inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond. These incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them, so we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam\u2019s Clubs in states where \u201copen carry\u201d is permitted \u2014 unless they are authorized law-enforcement officers.\n\nMcMillon made it clear that this \u201crequest\u201d didn\u2019t affect those legally carrying concealed weapons, and he hastened to add that the open-carry restriction would be enforced in a \u201cnonconfrontational\u201d way. Presumably, that means the greeters won\u2019t grab your hand cannon while offering you a shopping cart.\n\nIn an equally cautious, \u201cnonconfrontational\u201d manner, the Walmart CEO is backing some changes in public policy as well:\n\n[W]e encourage our nation\u2019s leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger. We do not sell military-style rifles, and we believe the reauthorization of the assault-weapons ban should be debated to determine its effectiveness. We must also do more, as a country, to understand the root causes that lead to this type of violent behavior. Today, I\u2019m sending letters to the White House and the Congressional leadership that call for action on these commonsense measures.\n\nSince fixing the background-check system has massive public support (despite the success of the gun lobby in stopping it), this probably won\u2019t hurt Walmart\u2019s sales to that many MAGA folk. But it\u2019s good to see this influential business moving in the direction of sanity and decency at a time when so many conservative lawmakers still think the key to reducing gun violence is to encourage the entire population to arm itself to the teeth.", "description": "After two shootings in its stores in August, including the El Paso massacre, Walmart is ending sales of handguns and handgun ammunition, banning open carrying of weapons, and even backing \u201ccommonsense\u201d gun restrictions.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/03/03-walmart-ammunition.w1200.h630.jpg"}
