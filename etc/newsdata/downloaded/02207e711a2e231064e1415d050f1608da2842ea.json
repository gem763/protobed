While Scott is rushed to hospital and his life hangs on by a thread, Robbo becomes distraught and desperate to find information on Jasmine.\n\nHe turns to drink and starts frequenting Salt, ignoring Colby\u2019s (Tim Franklin) efforts to intervene. Eventually, it\u2019s Justin (James Stewart) who steps in, apologising for giving him a hard time about Tori (Penny McNamee) and thanking him for putting her in protective custody, as at least she\u2019s safe. These words inspire Robbo to return to the investigation, where Colby has used traffic camera footage to spot the kidnappers\u2019 car heading towards Reefton Lakes.\n\nDes has an ultimatum for Jasmine (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nRobbo\u2019s frustration levels intensify the longer he hears nothing from the kidnappers, wondering why they\u2019ve taken his wife without making any demands. Colby tells him to keep his cool, as they need to approach the situation calmly to have the best chance of finding Jasmine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Jasmine is being held hostage in an abandoned warehouse by Des (Matt Zeremes) and his two cronies, Lenny and Fitz. Lenny was shot during the kidnapping and urgently needs medical help. Jasmine tells Des that Lenny needs to go to a hospital or he will die.\n\nRefusing the hospital route, Des tells Jasmine she either needs to fix Lenny or he will put him out of his misery. Thinking fast, Jasmine agrees to try, but asks Fitz to go out first for some very specific medical supplies in the hope Robbo\u2019s memory will be triggered\u2026\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Ben reveals huge investigation update to Maggie\n\nMORE: Home and Away spoilers: Mackenzie and Karen in showdown over Rick\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "While Robbo desperately looks for Jasmine, she is held hostage by Des and his thugs.", "authors": ["Imogen Groome"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EP-7207-Des-M.ZEREMES-tells-Jasmine-S.FROST-to-get-to-work-on-Lenny-J.DEL-RE_HAA-1442_0795-e63e_1571990111.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
