The Aston Villa captain has long been touted as a Pep Guardiola type of player, the sort the Spaniard likes to build his sides around.\n\nQuick, brave and adept on the ball, he has all the qualities embraced by Guardiola's championship-winning sides over the years. This was the first time Guardiola had ever managed a team against Villa. What better time to show him what he was missing?\n\nSadly, on a difficult afternoon when Villa were ultimately overwhelmed by a potent combination of Raheem Sterling\u2019s steely will and the Video Assistant Referee, there was little opportunity for Grealish to demonstrate that he belongs in such company.\n\nTalked up during the week by Alan Hudson as the best English midfielder in the Premier League, watched last weekend by the England manager Gareth Southgate, Grealish arrived at the Etihad with more than just eulogies to his name.\n\nThere is serious statistical evidence to back his growing reputation. This season he is the most fouled player in the division, indicating many opponents are obliged to kick him to prevent his incursions. And he has created the second highest number of scoring opportunities, behind City\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nYet there is one number against his name which is perhaps more telling: his age. He is 24. He is not 19 like City\u2019s Phil Foden, who delivered a delightful cameo when he came on as second half substitute. Grealish is the same age as Sterling, a player who has already accumulated 55 international caps, while Grealish is still spoken of as one for the future.", "description": "As auditions go, for Jack Grealish this did not go entirely to plan.", "authors": ["Jim White", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214195721-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqANzWi0AYGKT9eUr0AmZGlGuEzgGec2QQqk9Tdjwi4sE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
