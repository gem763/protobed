The 48-year-old suspect is seen left in a Facebook photo and right in court on Wednesday\n\nSmith, 48, was arrested on Tuesday after police linked him to a memory card found on the street that was labeled 'homicide at midtown Marriott'. The SD card allegedly contained 39 photos and 12 videos of the suspect brutally assaulting and strangling a woman in a hotel room at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott (pictured) in Anchorage\n\nAn affidavit described in gruesome detail how the videos showed the victim, who has not been named, being beaten on a hotel room floor as she attempted to fight back.\n\nThe footage - time-stamped September 4 - showed the woman with long dark hair being strangled as her assailant stomped on her throat.\n\nHours later the videos showed the suspect carrying her body through the hotel parking lot in a white sheet and placing it in a pickup truck that matched one Smith shares with his wife.\n\nThe dozens of photos showed the woman lying naked on the hotel carpet with a bruised left eye, bloodied blue lips and red marks on her face.\n\nPolice believe Smith took all of the crime scene photos and videos himself. It is unclear whether he knew the victim beforehand\n\nAn Anchorage resident came across the stray memory card on the street near her neighborhood grocery store on September 30.\n\nCurious about the 'homicide' label, she opened the card on her computer and discovered the cache of horrific images before alerting the police.\n\nTwo days later, a woman's remains were found about 20 miles south of Anchorage along the Seward Highway on October 2.\n\nPolice believe those remains belong to the same woman murdered in the video.\n\nThey have determined who she is but have not released her name pending the notification of her family. She is believed to be an Alaska native.\n\nSmith's cell phone records put him near where the body was found, according to the affidavit.\n\nHis vehicle was registered to the hotel on the night the killing took place.\n\nPolice are still working to determine whether the woman knew Smith and how she ended up in the hotel room.\n\nPolice believe human remains found on a highway about 20 miles south of Anchorage on October 2 belonged to the woman who was murdered in the hotel room. Investigators are pictured at the scene where the remains were discovered\n\nSmith was arrested at Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage on Tuesday as he returned home from a trip.\n\nHe was arraigned in court on Wednesday and is being held on $750,000 bond. Court records did not list an attorney for Smith.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Smith was born in Queenstown, South Africa, and has been married to an Alaska native since 2014.\n\nPolice did not disclose the nature of the previous investigation that led them to recognize Smith's accent in the memory card images.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, police thanked the Anchorage woman who turned in the memory card and said the discovery was 'instrumental' in Smith's arrest.\n\n'Had the citizen not called us after she found the video card, we would not have been able to solve this crime as quickly as we did,' Anchorage Police Department spokesman MJ Thim told KTVA.\n\nThim said investigators initially questioned whether the crimes recorded on the SD card had been staged.\n\n'We quickly ruled that out,' he said, 'and then started to piece together from the video, from the visual aspects for the images, and also the audio, we were able to quickly determine where this took place and we were starting to put together the timeline.'", "description": "Brian Steven Smith, 48, was arrested Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder.
