REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s rand weakened in early trade on Tuesday as an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude oil facilities over the weekend continued to weigh on risk sentiment.\n\nAt 0617 GMT, the rand traded 0.46% weaker at 14.7325 per dollar.\n\nThe rand, along with other emerging-market assets, last week benefited from increased risk appetite after Washington and Beijing officials made concessions on retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe risk-on mood lost its sheen as the attack on Saudi Arabian refining facilities disrupted global oil supply and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cMarket participants will be waiting with bated breath for any Saudi retaliation which could send the recently renewed risk sentiment rapidly down the drain,\u201d said Bianca Botes, treasury partner at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, in a note.\n\nSouth Africa, which is an oil importer, is likely to be hit by a surge in crude oil prices.\n\nInvestors are also turning their attention to monetary policy decisions from major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the South African Reserve Bank, due this week.\n\nIn fixed income, bonds weakened, with the yield on the benchmark instrument due in 2026 adding 2.5 basis points to 8.240%.", "description": "South Africa's rand weakened in early trade on Tuesday as an attack on Saudi Arabia's crude oil facilities over the weekend continued to weigh on risk sentiment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430749516&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0HI-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
