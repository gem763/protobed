Its goal is to drive the jobless rate down to 4.5 per cent from the present 5.3 per cent to spur larger wage rises and nudge soft inflation from 1.6 per cent into the 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band.\n\nBefore cutting rates below 1 per cent, Dr Lowe said in August that deploying unorthodox measures was unlikely but possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome market economists are tipping the RBA to further cut the cash rate another quarter point to 0.5 per cent in coming months and to launch a quantitative easing (QE) program next year, unless the Morrison government relents on its budget surplus commitment and unleashes a fiscal stimulus.\n\nDr Lowe said recently if the RBA embarked on unorthodox monetary policy, buying government bonds to lower the \"risk-free\" interest rate to reduce borrowing rates across the economy would probably be the bank's preferred tool.\n\nHe said a \"package\" of measures would be most effective.\n\nAsset purchases\n\nThe BIS report, Unconventional monetary policy tools: a cross-country analysis, notes asset purchases, such as central banks buying government bonds and other financial assets, proved to be \"very effective\" in all jurisdictions in lowering long-term yields and easing financial conditions.\n\nNegative interest rates and other more exotic measures are considered very unlikely in Australia. Since the GFC, central banks in the US, UK, Europe and Japan have resorted to a mix of extreme monetary policy measures.\n\n\"Overall, the main message is that [unconventional monetary policy tools] provided policymakers with additional policy space and flexibility, effectively addressing the GFC\u2019s most pernicious consequences and helping central banks pursue the achievement of their mandates when conventional policy was constrained,\" Dr Lowe's BIS report said.\n\n\"This response first stabilised and then stimulated the macro economy, albeit unevenly and with some delay.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNegative interest rates\n\nNegative interest rates employed in jurisdictions such as Switzerland and Japan were effective in pushing down long-term yields and this provided a stimulus, the report said.\n\n\"Although side effects, such as the compression of bank interest margins, were detected, they have not posed a major problem for banking stability to date because of offsets from other sources of income and the eventual recovery of bank portfolio values, including the declines in non-performing loans,\" the BIS said.\n\n\"That said, the potential longer-term effects of a prolonged period of negative rates on intermediaries cannot be fully assessed on the basis of current experience.\"\n\nLending operations\n\nThe BIS noted lending operations employed by central banks included extending the length of loans to commercial banks, expanding the types of eligible collateral such as bonds banks can swap for cash and imposing explicit conditions that the cheap central bank funding be on-lent to the economy.\n\n\"[ Lending operations] supported credit flows to the private sector and helped stabilise market expectations of interest rates, but may have not been immune to side effects such as some inefficient allocation of credit and a weakening of the private sector\u2019s incentive to reduce excessive leverage,\" the report said.\n\nForward guidance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForward guidance, whereby central banks promised to keep interest rates at a specified level until a particular inflation or unemployment goal was reached, was \"indispensable\" and \"quite effective\", the BIS report said.\n\n\"A key challenge with [forward guideance] in exceptional conditions has been balancing the trade-offs between clarity of message, credibility of follow-up action and flexibility of future policy response to changing circumstances.\"\n\nDr Lowe has already embarked on a mild version of forward guidance, by foreshadowing an \"extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target.\"\n\nSide effects\n\nUltra-loose monetary policy could have the adverse consequence of taking pressure off governments to implement difficult economic reforms and fiscal spending to boost the economy, the report warned.\n\n\"It might induce a bias toward inaction among other policy authorities, such as regulatory, prudential and fiscal policymakers, if they believe the burden of policy interventions can be left to the central bank, thus raising unfounded expectations that the central bank may resort to [unconventional monetary policy tools] against all types of adverse outcome,\" it said.\n\n\"The use of [unconventional monetary policy tools] by central banks would be more effective if other policy agencies are prepared to deal in a timely way with financial vulnerabilities as they arise, reducing the risk that [such tools] will be needed in the first place.\"\n\n\"Similarly, the action of other policy agencies, alongside the central bank, in addressing large systemic crises after they materialise would avoid an over reliance on [unconventional monetary policy tools] and help central banks to pursue their respective mandates.\"\n\nThe statement suggests the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and other financial regulators could play a role in helping the RBA should it opt to employ so-called quantitative easing.\n\nDr Lowe's broad endorsement stands in contrast to criticism of unconventional monetary stimulus by some economists, who argue ultra-low rates blew a bubble in the price of stocks and houses, worsened inequality between asset owners and workers, kept alive debt-ridden \"zombie\" firms and incited a currency war between central banks.\n\n\"On balance, the report concludes that the side effects have been limited to\n\ndate, although it is too early to fully assess some of the longer-term implications,\" the BIS said.", "description": "RBA governor Philip Lowe says any buying of financial assets, or a move to negative interest rates must be supported by the government and prudential regulator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7072%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_977%2C$y_615/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/01fc489200a09550a8e9962fbc64b088c6291cb8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
