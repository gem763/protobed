But the other soaps have reason to celebrate, with EastEnders and Emmerdale winning the highest quantity of prizes and Coronation Street, Neighbours, Holby City and Casualty also taking home gongs.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the soap magazine that Hollyoaks has won the Best Soap prize, a testament to a huge year of the soap which has seen the hard hitting far right extremism storyline, the devastating ending for Lily McQueen and the footballer abuse storyline.\n\nStephanie Davis (Sinead O\u2019Connor) and Adam Woodward (Brody Hudson) were named Best Actress and Best Actor for their parts in storylines focusing on sexual abuse.

We reckon that with all of this to celebrate, there will be some sore heads but wide smiles chez Hollyoaks tomorrow.\n\nEastEnders has continued its resurgence with four awards, including a board sweep in the comedy stakes despite being known as a gritty and dark programme. Danny Dyer (Mick Carter) and Lorraine Stanley (Karen Taylor) are Funniest Male and Female while Max Bowden has silenced the initial Ben Mitchell recast doubters with an award for Best Bad Boy.\n\nThe ever popular child performer Kara Leah Fernandes (Bailey Baker) was still representing Walford as she took home another Best Young Actor trophy.\n\nWith Emmerdale also taking home an impressive four prizes, it was a great night for ITV too.
