It\u2019s not a worked out legal treaty text, but it is composed of principles agreed by both sides.\n\nLabour wants a customs union and alignment with the single market; the European Commission has repeatedly said that both these options are on the table. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier himself has even said the political declaration could be rewritten to include them in a matter of days. That is one benefit of the political declaration not being a complicated legal text \u2013 it\u2019s easy to change.\n\nMr Barnier even restated this this week. He told the European parliament on Wednesday: \u201cThe door is open to a higher ambition if there is a shared desire in that area. Obviously we want to be as ambitious as possible in rebuilding our economic relationship with the UK.\u201d\n\nOne additional point to make is that changing the political declaration to enact a soft Brexit also solves the Northern Ireland border problem which has dogged talks for the last couple of years.\n\nThis is because the border problem only appears in a hard Brexit, where there are checks on goods between the UK and EU markets. Membership of a customs union and the EU single market would render this situation and the backstop furore more-or-less irrelevant.\n\nThe EU in fact pushed this approach to solving the Northern Ireland issue at the beginning of the year when Theresa May was still prime minister, but was basically ignored. The government did not want to go for a soft Brexit.\n\nThere would not even need to be a \u201cnegotiation\u201d as such to achieve this softening. The UK would more or less be simply adopting an option that the EU has presented as available since the beginning. No leverage or brinkmanship required.\n\nBut above all, the crucial point is that the withdrawal agreement being \u201cthe only deal on the table\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the UK can\u2019t have a soft Brexit, or change the future relationship spelled out in the deal.
