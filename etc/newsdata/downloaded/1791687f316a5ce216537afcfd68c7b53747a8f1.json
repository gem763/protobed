You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor most people regardless of whether they're based in the UK or overseas, their high street bank is the first port of call when making international money transfers assuming that it\u2019s their best option. However, regardless of where you live in the world and what types of bank accounts you have set up, most banks offer poor exchange rates and levy a variety of hidden charges.\n\nAt the end of the day they know that very few of their customers bother to check the rates and how much they\u2019re paying. As a result they take advantage of a captive market and continue to cash in on our lethargy.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be this way and it pays to shop around for the best.\n\nWhen making international payments, the costs fall into two simple areas: fees and the exchange rate. When shopping around and comparing one company with another, regardless of whether it\u2019s your high street bank or a currency specialist, it\u2019s important to pinpoint two things.\n\nFees - The key charges to look out for include transfer charges and overseas bank receiving fees.\n\nExchange rates - many banks claim to be \u2018commission free\u2019 then load the exchange rate. It\u2019s also difficult to get hold of the exact rate and compare it, as some providers simply don\u2019t provide the information.\n\nGetting the most for your money actually boils down to a very simple question: \u201cHow many euros/dollars/Swiss francs/pounds will I receive for my money, after all charges?\u201d\n\nThe exchange rate is the rate at which banks and brokers buy and sell money to each other. Private individuals and small-to-medium-sized businesses cannot access these rates. Remember exchange rates often change by the minute, so to compare providers properly you need to do it one after the other.\n\nHow are exchange rates calculated?\n\nThe rate you are offered will be dependent upon a number of factors including\n\nThe amount of money you are transferring\n\nThe time-frames you are working to (i.e. whether you are looking to lock into an exchange rate for up to 12 months)\n\nThe currencies you are buying and selling and the volatility of those currencies\n\nThe exchange rate levels at the time of purchase\n\nSee how much you could save with XE: sign up and make a transfer\n\nHow to find the best deal\n\nFor larger bank-to-bank international money transfers, i.e. \u00a3250 and over, it pays to compare your high street bank\u2019s exchange rates with those offered by some of the many currency specialists that exist.\n\nTypical reasons for making international transfers include\n\nSmaller one-off transfers, topping up an overseas bank account, transfers to family members back home, etc\n\nRegular transfers, pension transfers, overseas mortgage payments, salary transfers, etc\n\nLarge purchases abroad such as stocks and shares, property, boats, cars, etc\n\nWhatever your currency exchange needs, let the experts at XE provide you with all the help and guidance you need to get the best rates possible when moving your money overseas.

So on \u20ac100,000, this could equate to a saving of \u20ac4,000 on the exchange rate alone.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that due to their branch networks, the high street banks have to set their exchange rates once or twice a day. To make sure they remain profitable they have to increase the spreads to allow for intraday exchange rate volatility. Brokers give clients access to live rates saving you money.\n\nHow quick is it to use a currency specialist?\n\nBy using a currency company you\u2019ll also avoid international banking fees, which vary from bank to bank, and your money will get there a lot faster.\n\nThe transfers will in most cases be free and transferred either same day within one to two working days depending on where you\u2019re sending the money.\n\nTiming can mean everything\n\nDepending on the amount you\u2019re sending, the timing of a transaction can also be important particularly if you\u2019re sending larger amounts.\n\nIn many cases, people don\u2019t pay much attention to what\u2019s happening to the exchange rate and simply leave their decision to make the international money transfer to the last minute hoping for a good rate, assuming, that without all the funds available, there isn\u2019t much they can do.\n\nRegardless of why you\u2019re transferring your money, the larger the amount you\u2019re looking to move overseas, the more important it is to maximise the timing of your transaction and minimise the risk that the exchange rate could get worse and make your money worth less. Remember, as soon as you decide to move overseas or buy and sell an asset abroad such as a property, you are exposed to adverse moves in the currency market.\n\nHow to choose a currency specialist\n\nIt\u2019s important that you undertake the following checks when choosing a currency specialist:\n\nHow long have they been in business?\n\nAre they authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Payment Services Regulations 2009? Companies that are authorised by the FSA have had to meet strict capital adequacy and business practice rules, comply with Payment Services Regulations and the FCA\u2019s Conduct of Business requirements.\n\nAre they registered with HM Customs as an overseas money service business?\n\nDo they hold your money in segregated client trust accounts? Your funds are held separately from company funds protecting it from creditors.\n\nDo they have audited accounts on their website and how strong is the company\u2019s balance sheet?\n\nDo they have professional indemnity insurance protecting customers from staff fraud, etc?\n\nHow many staff do they have and what turnover? Obviously a large established company is more reliable than two guys in a back room, though it\u2019s no guarantee.\n\nDo they have direct access to SWIFT? SWIFT is the world\u2019s largest payments and settlements network for domestic and international trades. Direct access ensures you, the client, benefit from faster payments and enhanced security.\n\nSee how much you could save with XE: sign up and make a transfer", "description": "Whether you own a property overseas, work abroad, or make regular international money transfers for a pension or mortgage abroad, this simple step by step guide gives you all the information you need to understand how to get the most out of your money transfers, because if you don\u2019t do your homework, you could end up losing large amounts of money in hidden fees and poor", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/14/photo-1538356111053-748a48e1acb8.jpg"}
