He admitted earlier in the tournament that he does not yet feel like he is running at 100 per cent, and even conceded that by reading too many messages telling him he should be careful not to get injured, he was not flying into collisions as he normally would.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut with Vunipola stepping up his training on Tuesday, defence coach Mitchell revealed that the back-row forward is working on ways to adapt his game that his opponents are not expecting, in order to prove he is not a one-trick pony.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going well,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cLike any player, he wants to play better. He\u2019s having to make a couple of little adjustments in his game, because players obviously start to read you in terms of what you do. That\u2019s really good awareness from him, to make those adjustments.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Marler stood up to take on responsibility in the absence of first-choice Mako Vunipola, and ensured that his absence did not become a weakness. AFP via Getty Images 3/16 2. Shota Horie (Japan) Arguably the player of the pool stage. Horie\u2019s familiar locks have made him famous for more than just his rugby skills, but it is what he is doing on the field that he deserves praise for. Standout performances against Ireland and Scotland tell you all you need to know about his form so far. Getty Images 4/16 3. Tadhg Furlong (Ireland) Furlong was outstanding against Samoa and has provided strong consistency across the pool stage to help Ireland get back on their feet. With most tighthead props being rotated game by game, it makes selection rather tricky to look for standout moments, but Furlong\u2019s two crunching runs in his most recent outing see him stand out from the rest.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe loves the ball in his hand and his experience is also really, really good amongst the rest of the back-row group. He carries a bit more experience than the others and his willingness to share and care for them has also been really impressive. He\u2019s a guy who is really consistent, but knowing him, he will want to play better.\u201d\n\nOne school of thought that Eddie Jones supported two weeks ago is that Vunipola plays much better when his older brother, Mako, is on the pitch with him. The pair have not featured as much together over the last two years due to injuries, with either one or both suffering from long-term lay-offs that have affected them both physically and mentally.\n\nMitchell doesn\u2019t fully buy into that belief, conceding his knowledge of the Vunipolas is not understanding enough to make a judgement, but he does feel that the giant No 8 reserves his best performances for the biggest games \u2013 like the one in Oita this Saturday against the Wallabies.\n\n\u201cI think he likes that, but he goes about it in a very quiet way,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a big \u2018ra-ra\u2019 guy, he\u2019ll just get on with it. Because he\u2019s been on restricted training activity, in terms of dealing with the injury, he\u2019s chomping at the bit to get out there in training and get the ball in his hands.\u201d\n\nPart of giving Vunipola the ammunition to do that relies on England getting him into the right shape, and that doesn\u2019t mean they need to make him as fit as possible. It has been noticeable how his 20-stone-plus frame has changed over the course of the last year, prompting Jones to hail him as \u201cfitter than ever\u201d earlier this year.\n\nBut Mitchell concedes that England perhaps went too far in trying to cut the Saracens man down, and believe they now have him within his optimum range to get the best out of arguably their most important forward in the World Cup squad.\n\nMitchell said: \u201cI think he\u2019s at a very optimal body weight. The last campaign, it was too extreme, whereas at the minute he\u2019s at an optimal stage. He\u2019s done very well in the pre-season camp but we\u2019ve tried to keep him at his right body-weight rather than a weight which is manufactured and unnatural for him. If he loses too much weight, it\u2019s not ideal for him.\u201d", "description": "Billy Vunipola, by his own admission, is yet to deliver his best at the Rugby World Cup, but the England\u00a0forward is undergoing something of a reassessment after being worked out by his opponents, according to coach John Mitchell.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/04/billy-vunipola.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
