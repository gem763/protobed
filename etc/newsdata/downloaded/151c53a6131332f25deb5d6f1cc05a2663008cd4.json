You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut it has also been controversial, with Murphy using homophobic slurs throughout his set and joking about women and AIDS. In 1996, Murphy apologised for the jokes, saying: \u201cI deeply regret any pain all this has caused. Just like the rest of the world, I am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in 1981.\n\n\u201cI think it is unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to an informed 35-year-old man. I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over. I know that AIDS isn\u2019t funny. It\u2019s 1996 and I\u2019m a lot smarter about AIDS now.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
