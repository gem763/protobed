Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.\u201d\n\nIn between meetings with the DUP, Mr Johnson rallied Tory backbenchers in a Commons committee room - and likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest.\n\nThe PM told his MPs: \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse a mountaineering metaphor, we are at the Hillary Step - and the summit, you can see but it\u2019s shrouded in cloud.\n\n\u201cBut we can see it and we will get there.\u201d\n\nTory MP Bim Afolami said there was a \u201csense of relief in the room that we\u2019re almost there,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long slog.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe rocky Hillary Step outcrop named after mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary collapsed in 2015.\n\nSources also said Mr Johnson compared Brexit to Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption in which the hero escapes jail by wading through a tunnel of sewage.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s reference to the Hillary Step could, like many of the Prime Minister\u2019s colourful comparisons, ultimately and unwittingly backfire on him.\n\nThe 39ft rocky outcrop was located very high on Mount Everest at 28,839ft above sea level, near the summit.\n\nNamed after mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who became the first climber to reach the top of the mountain, it was located on the south-east ridge, halfway between the \u201cSouth Summit\u201d and the true summit.\n\nOnline reports say it gave climbers the last real challenge before reaching the top of the mountain via the south-east route.\n\nBut it no longer exists, having most likely collapsed in 2015 during a massive earthquake.\n\nFlanked by bodyguards, Mr Johnson scurried away from the 1922 Committee meeting after just eight minutes, telling MPs he had \u201cthings to do\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the PM held a 45-minute Cabinet meeting in No10, updating senior ministers on the progress of talks.\n\n\u201cHe said there was a chance of securing a good deal but we are not there yet and there remain outstanding issues,\u201d said Mr Johnson\u2019s spokesman.\n\n\u201cFollowing a positive discussion, Cabinet gave the PM its full support in the Government\u2019s continuing efforts to secure a deal ahead of European Council.\u201d\n\nHe also held a series of meetings in No10 with Tory Brexit hardliners.\n\n(Image: WILL OLIVER/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nArch-Brexiteer Steve Baker said he would need to see the legal text of a deal before any vote on it.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf I am not shown the legal text I shall vote no because I haven\u2019t read it.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson is expected to fly to Brussels at lunchtime today.\n\nBut his RAF plane was on standby for a quick dash across the Channel in the early hours if negotiations reached a crucial point.\n\nEven if he manages to secure a fresh Withdrawal Agreement, the PM faces a knife-edge Commons vote to win MPs\u2019 backing.\n\nHe has a majority of minus 45 after stripping rebel Conservatives of the party whip and being hit by a series of defections.\n\nIf Mr Johnson wins the DUP\u2019s support for a deal, most Tory Brexiteers in its European Research Group would be expected to follow.\n\nHe could end up needing the backing of a handful of Labour MPs to finally cross the line.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSources suggested about a dozen Labour backbenchers from Leave-supporting seats could vote for a deal.\n\nThe Commons will vote on Thursday on triggering a rare Saturday sitting of Parliament this weekend, from 9.30am to 2pm.\n\nThe last took place in April 1982 after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.\n\nIf Mr Johnson fails to get a deal through the Commons by 11pm Saturday, he is legally-bound to ask Brussels for a fresh Brexit delay.\n\nHe has repeatedly vowed the UK will leave on October 31, \u201cdo or die, come what may\u201d.\n\nBut Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay today admitted the Tory leader would write to the EU Commission requesting another extension - as previously revealed in documents submitted during a Scottish court challenge.\n\nMr Barclay told MPs: \u201cI can confirm, as the Prime Minister has repeatedly set out, that firstly the Government will comply with the law, and secondly it will comply with undertakings given to the court in respect of the law.\u201d\n\nThe PM\u2019s spokesman insisted: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we will comply with the law but we will be leaving on October 31.\u201d\n\nHowever, even if the Government succeeds in pushing a deal through Parliament, EU sources believe a short technical extension could be needed beyond Halloween .\n\nA Withdrawal Agreement would need to be signed-off by the European Parliament - and various pieces of legislation need to pass through Parliament.\n\nHowever, Mr Barclay stressed MPs were able to act speedily when they wanted to - indicating he believed there was still enough time.", "description": "EU leaders are due to gather from 2pm on Thursday -
