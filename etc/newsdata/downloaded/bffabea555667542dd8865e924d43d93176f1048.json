It gave Kurdish fighters along the border a chance to retreat deeper into northern Syria.\n\nDuring an impromptu press conference shortly after the announcement on Thursday, Mr Trump heaped praise on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as Turkish officials cast doubt on the American claims of a meaningful ceasefire.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank and congratulate president Erdogan. He\u2019s a friend of mine and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have a problem because, frankly, he is a hell of a leader and a tough man, a strong man,\u201d Mr Trump said. He had tweeted following Mr Pence\u2019s press conference to brag about taking \u201ca necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path\u201d.\n\nMr Pence had announced the 120-hour ceasefire to allow Kurdish forces to leave the area, and claimed that the military offensive would ultimately end after those Kurds had left.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria,\" Mr Pence said. \"The Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone for 120 hours. All military operations ... will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely upon completion of the withdrawal,\u201d he added, referring to an acronym used to describe the People\u2019s Protection Units, the leading faction within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a largely Kurdish militia that has been an ally of the United States.\n\nHe continued, during an appearance alongside secretary of State Mike Pompeo: \u201cOnce that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent ceasefire and the United States of America will work with Turkey \u2014 will work with nations around the world \u2014 to make sure peace and stability are the order of the day in this safe zone.\u201d\n\nThe deal represents a big political win for Mr Erdogan, staving off Congressional sanctions while getting the US to agree to a safe zone it has long wanted. He will probably exploit the sight of two top US officials coming to his capital to work out a deal to bolster his own credibility internationally.\n\nBut many questions remain and experts doubted the durability of the halt in violence. For one thing, it remained wholly unclear whether the SDF had agreed to the deal, or whether Moscow, which has emerged as the principal power broker in Syria, has acceded to it. A few days ago Russia brokered a deal between the Syria regime in Damascus and the SDF to allow uniformed army forces to take control of the border.\n\nShortly after the ceasefire was announced, SDF Chief Commander General Mazloum was quoted as saying that fighting was continuing in the region where it had been agreed that it would stop.\n\nHe said his forces had agreed to the ceasefire, but discussions needed to take place about stopping the fighting in other regions because there should \u201cbe no demographic changes\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat this means for the SDF is ultimately in Russia\u2019s hands,\u201d Nick Danforth, a Turkey expert at the German Marshall Fund, said.\n\nThe Syrian regime sees Turkey as its greatest threat, and is unlikely to agree to allow any permanent Turkish presence on its soil, and to lobby its patrons in Moscow to reject the deal.\n\nThe 13-point agreement includes guarantees by Turkey to ensure the safety and well-being of civilians inside the zone it is to control, and designates the Turkish armed forces to \u201cprimarily\u201d enforce the safe zone, ignoring the presence of tens of thousands of Ankara-backed Arab armed groups that Turkey uses as its surrogates and who have been responsible for most of the human rights abuses in parts of Syria under Turkish control.\n\nThe agreement was announced following a four-hour meeting between Mr Pence and Mr Erdogan, and comes after Mr Trump removed American forces from northern Syria. That withdrawal has allowed Turkey to begin a military offensive in the region, imperilling US-backed Syrian Kurds who played an important role in fighting back against Isis.", "description": "Turkey agreed to a five-day cessation of hostilities on Thursday in its ongoing conflict against a Kurdish-led militia in Syria\u2019s northeast, despite lingering questions about whether the United States-brokered deal would be sustainable or receive the blessing of Russia.Donald Trump hailed what he described", "authors": ["Clark Mindock", "Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5hPMVB4iV9yyQL5ELnHP3A--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/1f1387140e7333998e168560e7532d80", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
