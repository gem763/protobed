Its shares drove a 0.81% fall in the communication services sector.\n\nThird-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies have largely been better than expected, with over 78% of the 204 that have reported so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a retracement trade from yesterday's move in the equity markets.
