And he added: \u201cThe WAB will not be put back. This is the way to get Brexit done so the country can move on.\u201d\n\nOpposition parties voiced concern that Mr Johnson\u2019s proposed exit date came after students have returned home from university for their Christmas break, with Mr Corbyn claiming that many would be \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d along with elderly and disabled voters who would not venture to the polling stations in the potentially cold and wet conditions of a December ballot.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Labour MPs were whipped to abstain, with just Kate Hoey rebelling to support the election motion.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs that voters would find the official opposition\u2019s refusal to support an election \u201cutterly bewildering\u201d.\n\nDeclaring his next effort to secure a poll, he said: \u201cWe will not allow this paralysis to continue. One way or another, we must proceed straight to an election.\n\n\u201cThis House can\u2019t any longer hold this country hostage \u2026 Now that no deal is off the table, we have a great new deal and it is time for the voters to have a chance to pronounce on that deal and replace this dysfunctional parliament with a new parliament that can get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nFormer chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 stripped of the Tory whip after rebelling over no deal \u2013 denounced the PM\u2019s move as \u201cself-indulgent\u201d.\n\n\u201cParliament showed last week it wanted to get on with the bill \u2013 it\u2019s the government that hasn\u2019t allowed us to do so,\u201d said Mr Hammond. \u201cSo stop the self-indulgent focus on elections on both sides and concentrate on passing the bill. If we\u2019d done that last week, we could have finished it by now.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s words concealed deep divisions within his party over the wisdom of going to the country before EU withdrawal is complete, leaving Tories vulnerable to attack by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn also faces disquiet among his parliamentary party about the prospect of an election in which polls suggest many of them could lose their seats.\n\nResponding to the PM\u2019s latest proposal, Ms Swinson said: \u201cBoris Johnson claims he wants a general election, but he also claimed he wouldn\u2019t prorogue parliament or put a border down the Irish sea. If Boris Johnson wants a general election, then he could have supported our bill for a general election on 9 December. Instead, he has chosen to stick to his original plan for 12 December which we have already rejected.\n\n\u201cLiberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and will continue to campaign to stop Brexit, just as we have for the last three years.\u201d\n\nAn SNP source said: \u201cThe SNP will consider the contents of the bill when it is published and will scrutinise it very carefully. We want an election, but we know that time and again this Tory government has shown it cannot be trusted.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has dramatically offered to shelve plans to ratify his EU withdrawal deal, in a desperate last-ditch scramble to force a December general election. The last-minute offer sets the scene for a possible pre-Christmas poll which would be dominated by Brexit \u2013 and by the prime minister\u2019s failure to take the UK out of the EU by his self-imposed Halloween deadline.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/19/front-boris-johnson-28-october-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
