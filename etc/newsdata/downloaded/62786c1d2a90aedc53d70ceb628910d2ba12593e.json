From the FlaPol blog story:\n\nAlmost overlooked at the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s bi-annual convention in Orlando last weekend was adoption of a platform resolution that includes potentially revolutionary language for efforts to protect Florida\u2019s environment. One of the \u201cbe it resolved\u201d clauses in a \u201cDemand Clean Water\u201d resolution approved by the party\u2019s general meeting includes a handful of key words: \u201crecognizing and protecting the inherent rights of nature, as we have done for corporations.\u201d The seemingly odd wording is a nod to an emerging national legal strategy in the environmental protection community, one that already is appearing in other statements in Orange County and elsewhere. The effort is to legally declare that rivers, lakes, forests, estuaries, reefs, or other natural features may have inherent rights against degradation, which can be defended in court, much as corporations have been found to possess inherent rights.\n\nThe \u201calmost overlooked\u201d part of the story is the problem that could allow this radical approach to personalizing nature \u2014 a neo-earth religion, if you will \u2014 to be insinuated into our national politics. People hear that mosquitoes, pond scum, frogs, and viruses \u2014 all parts of nature \u2014 will have \u201crights\u201d and roll their eyes thinking, \u201cOh please. Leftists are not that nuts!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes they are! The anti-humanists aren\u2019t fringe in environmentalism any longer, and indeed, are coopting legitimate environmentalist advocacy.\n\nMake no mistake: \u201cNature rights\u201d isn\u2019t about stopping pollution. Rather, it allows anyone to sue to protect nature\u2019s supposed right to \u201d exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution.\u201d That\u2019s akin to a right to life. (Apparently, human fetuses aren\u2019t considered part of nature.) That means any use of the natural world that disturbs what would otherwise exist in the wild is subject to legal attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine the lawfare extortion possibilities. At the very least, major, job-producing enterprises could be brought to a screeching halt. Try getting a liability insurance policy if the carrier knows anyone can sue to protect \u201cnature\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI predict nature rights will make it into the Democratic platform next year, or at the very least, will receive a sympathetic hearing. State legislatures and Congress need to thwart this drive by passing laws stating that no non-human animal or aspect of nature has any standing in court or any enforceable rights. (The Ohio Legislature did that after Lake Erie was granted rights. Good thing the governor is Republican. A Democrat might have vetoed!)\n\nDo it now, before it is too late!", "description": "We could see it nationally adopted in the Democratic party next year.", "authors": ["Wesley J.
