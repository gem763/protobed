In addition, it also announced the division of the state into two territories to be directly ruled from New Delhi \u2013 one consisting of Jammu and Kashmir and the other the remote Buddhist enclave of Ladakh.\n\nAt the same time, it poured thousands of more troops into the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, where separatists have been fighting against Indian rule for decades, and made sweeping arrests to prevent any outbreak of violence.\n\nThe government also imposed severe restrictions on travel and cut telephone and Internet lines.\n\nSchools and colleges are empty and most shops, restaurants and hotels shut. Hundreds of people, including mainstream political leaders and separatists fighting for Kashmir\u2019s secession from India, remain in custody for fear that they could whip up mass protests.\n\nCrowds have also been gathering this week in the streets of Srinagar, the biggest city in Kashmir, and elsewhere, throwing stones at security forces in protest against the continuing clampdown.\n\nNEW TERRITORIES\n\nOn Thursday, Mr G.C. Murmu, a former bureaucrat from Mr Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, will be sworn in as the first lieutenant-governor of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the government said.\n\nAnother former civil servant, Mr Radha Krishna Mathur, will take office as the lieutenant-governor of Ladakh, the Buddhist-dominated high altitude region that has long sought to disentangle itself from Kashmir, on grounds that the turmoil there had hurt its own growth prospects.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kashmir-lockdown-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
