How long does it take to get onto a tatami and bow? A lot more time than it took Uzbekistan\u2019s Sharofiddin Boltaboev to defeat Rigaqi Nai from China at the Tashkent Grand Prix - performing what\u2019s believed to be the fastest ever ippon in competitive judo history - in just two seconds.\n\nThe monumental tai-o-toshi sent the home crowd wild - and it also sent Boltaboev en route to his first ever gold medal on the world judo tour, defeating his compatriot Kamoliddin Rasulov in the final to take the U81KG crown.\n\nHe received his medal from the President of the Uzbekistan Judo Federation, Azizjon Kamilov.\n\n\u201cI wanted to win the Tashkent Grand Prix,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cWhen I won a fight in two seconds I got the feeling I was going to I win today.\u201d\n\nOur woman of the day is Kathrin Unterwurzacher. In the women\u2019s U63KG final, the Austrian defeated Anriquelis Barrios from Venezuela with a superb Osae Komi. A seventh grand prix gold for Unterwurzacher, in the seventh edition of the Tashkent Grand Prix.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s my favourite country now,\u201d said Unterwurzacher afterwards. \u201cBecause every time I\u2019m here I get a medal. So I like it for the public and it\u2019s very good here.\u201d\n\nThis was the second day of the tournament - and Khikmatillokh Turaev took a second gold for the host nation in the men\u2019s U73KG category - defeating Tajikistan's Behruzi Khojazoda in a dramatic contest. Khojazoda scored first and stayed ahead until the very last second - when Turaev picked the perfect moment to make a golden score - and win standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nHis medal was presented by First Deputy Minister of Physical Culture and Sports of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Oybek Kosimov.\n\nBut Elisavet Teltsidou from Greece prevented a hat trick of golds for the home nation - taking the women\u2019s U70KG crown in the last final of the day by defeating Gulnoza Matniyazova. It is her second title of the season.", "description": "The two second tai-o-toshi sent the home crowd wild - and it also sent Boltaboev en route to his first ever gold medal on the world judo tour", "authors": ["Richard Good"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/17/40/36/1000x563_cmsv2_950c5c7d-1ef7-589f-b69b-4a27ba466db1-4174036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
