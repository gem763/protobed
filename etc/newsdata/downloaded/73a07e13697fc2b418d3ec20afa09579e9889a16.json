This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president\u2019s critics find particularly infuriating \u2014 the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself. But whether the subject is the Clinton Foundation\u2019s influence-peddling or now the Biden family\u2019s variation on that theme, Trump has always sold himself as the candidate of a more honest form of graft \u2014 presenting his open cynicism as preferable to carefully legal self-dealing, exquisitely laundered self-enrichment, the spirit of \u201chey, it\u2019s totally normal for the vice president\u2019s son to get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the Ukrainians or the Chinese so long as every disclosure form gets filled out and his dad doesn\u2019t talk to him about the business.\u201d\n\nIn fact this sort of elite seaminess is bad, but what Trump offers isn\u2019t preferable: Hypocrisy is better than naked vice, soft corruption is better than the more open sort, and what the president appears to have done in leaning on the Ukrainian government is much worse than Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas arrangements. But no one should be surprised that some voters in our age of mistrust and fragmentation and despair prefer the honest graft \u2014 some in Trump\u2019s base, and also some in the ranks of the alienated and aggrieved middle, the peculiar Obama-Trump constituency.\n\nIndeed, history is replete with \u201cboss\u201d-style politicians who got away with corruption because they were seen as the rough, effective alternative to a smug, hypocritical elite.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Impeach-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
