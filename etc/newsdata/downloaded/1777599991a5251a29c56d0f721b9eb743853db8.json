REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe central bank on Wednesday cut rates for the third time this year, as expected, but signaled its rate-cut cycle might be at a pause. Investors, however, found enough in the central bank's message to power the benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX 0.3% higher to close at a fresh record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the willingness of the Fed to indicate continued flexibility,\u201d said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThey said they remain open to what the data shows them. Flexibility is what the market wants to see,\u201d said Meckler.\n\nIn lowering its policy rate the U.S. central bank dropped a previous reference in its policy statement that it \u201cwill act as appropriate\u201d to sustain the economic expansion - language that was considered a sign of future rate cuts.\n\n\u201cThe language and the policy change was as expected,\u201d said Michael Purves, chief executive at Tallbacken Capital Advisors in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s an affirmation that the equity and credit markets have been arguably more right than the bond market. The bond market seems to have been predicting much more dire economic conditions.\u201d\n\nAmid financial market volatility, the interest rates on some long-dated government bonds recently slipped below the level for short-term debt, causing a so-called \u201cinverted yield curve,\u201d widely viewed as a recession indicator.\n\nIn late May, yields on 3-month Treasury bills began to exceed yields paid by 10-year Treasury bonds. The yield curve returned to normal on Oct. 11, although historically a re-steepening after an inversion has not meant the economy is out of the woods.\n\nU.S. stocks have been sensitive to the central bank\u2019s stance toward interest rates. Weakness in the market late last year amid growing worries about global growth and trade tensions was at least part of the driver behind the Fed\u2019s abrupt pivot from a tightening stance to delivering three interest rate cuts this year.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Fed interest rate decisions: here\n\nOn Wednesday, investors found much to cheer in the Fed\u2019s assessment of the economy.\n\nRisks relating to global trade, as well as to the prospect that Britain would crash out of the European Union, have moved in a \u201cpositive direction\u201d since the Fed\u2019s last meeting, Powell said, adding that the U.S. economy has remained resilient.\n\nPowell also said the Fed does not currently see large financial imbalances or asset bubbles, another comforting message for investors worried about stock valuations.\n\nStocks were also taking heart from some bullish signs: U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a further contraction in business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.\n\nThe recent easing of tensions between Washington and Beijing has also helped support risk sentiment.\n\nTo be sure, though, many stock investors still seem to be counting on the Fed to ride to the rescue if the decade-long bull market shows signs of cracking.\n\n\u201cIf the market slows down in anticipation of an economic slowdown, will the Fed respond and keep lowering rates? My sense is that they probably will,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.", "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve may be done cutting interest rates but stock investors are not done buying.", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446710392&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T22T", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
