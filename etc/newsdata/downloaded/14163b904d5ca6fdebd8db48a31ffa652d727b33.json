Other responsibilities would remain with London.\n\nThe assembly would be led by a first minister and deputy first minister with a power-sharing balance between unionists and nationalists.\n\nThe agreement also set up a North/South Ministerial Council, bringing together assembly members and their counterparts in Dublin on issues of \"mutual interest\".", "description": "Britain's new proposals to break the Brexit deadlock largely focus on arrangements for the border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland after the country leaves the EU.
