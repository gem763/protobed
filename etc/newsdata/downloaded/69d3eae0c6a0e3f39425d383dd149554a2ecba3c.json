I mean, you\u2019ve got Winnie the Pooh and Piglet in jail?! Now come on, China!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China,\u201d the show\u2019s official Twitter page added Oct. 6.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter noted Monday that government censors responded by \u201cdeleting virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pages.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd on Baidu\u2019s Tieba, China\u2019s largest online discussions platform, the threads and sub-threads related to South Park are nonfunctional. If users manually type in the URL for what was formerly the South Park thread, a message appears saying that, \u2018According to the relevant law and regulation, this section is temporarily not open,\u2019\u201d THR added.\n\nChina\u2019s decision comes roughly one month after Mr. Parker told the magazine that writers should be able to find comedy in issues besides President Trump.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to not come in and talk about Donald Trump,\u201d he said of creating the show\u2019s previous season \u2014 its 22nd. \u201cAnd I think it was nice for people to watch and go, \u2018Oh, yeah, there is still comedy outside of f\u2014g Donald Trump. There is still funny s\u2014 as the world goes on.\u2019 And you can get your Trump comedy on so many other shows.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
