A brief filed by the Mexican government calls that argument \u201cbaseless.\u201d \u201cAgent Mesa\u2019s shooting of Sergio Hernandez was not part of an antiterrorism operation or other national security operation,\u201d Mexico\u2019s brief asserts. \u201cRather, it arose in the context of ordinary law enforcement activities, just as if Sergio had been shot on U.S. soil.\u201d The brief adds, \u201cInvocation of the words \u2018national security\u2019 is not a magic talisman that can ward off judicial scrutiny of unlawful government action.\u201d\n\nClearly, this case finds the Supreme Court at an inflection point. While Justice Kennedy insisted in his Ziglar opinion that the court was not abandoning Bivens but was simply not extending it, he is no longer there to apply even that minimal brake pressure. Whether Bivens will survive at all is really the question.\n\nThe extensive briefing on behalf of the Hernandez parents will give the justices something to think about. Two former officials of the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency, the Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, have filed a brief filled with disturbing details about a lawless culture inside the Border Patrol. \u201cWithout the possibility of civil liability, the unlikely prospect of discipline or criminal prosecution will not provide a meaningful deterrent to abuse at the border,\u201d the two former officials, James Tomsheck and James Wong, assert in their brief. (Having read this brief, I was less sympathetic than I might otherwise have been to the \u201cmorale crisis\u201d of Border Patrol agents depicted in an interesting article in The Times last month.)\n\nThe Institute for Justice, a libertarian organization often allied with the current administration, has filed a brief on the parents\u2019 behalf that may get the attention of the court\u2019s conservatives. It makes an originalist argument for Bivens as having not only \u201ca storied common law pedigree\u201d dating back to England and to colonial America, but also as offering \u201cthe only route to recovery now available to individuals like Sergio Hernandez\u2019s parents.\u201d The court should \u201cfully embrace the Bivens remedy as a means for holding federal officers personally liable when they violate constitutional rights,\u201d the brief argues, prominently citing a concurring opinion that Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote as an appeals court judge, shortly before President Trump named him to the Supreme Court, arguing that \u201cthere may be some circumstances when federal courts have to act because state courts are unable or unwilling to intervene.\u201d\n\nThe current Supreme Court is a court with projects. (Remember the Janus case from the term before last, the culmination of Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s yearslong, multicase effort to disable public employee unions?) There\u2019s no doubt that dismantling Bivens is on the project list \u2014 whether brick by brick or all at once, we shall soon see.\n\nThe court will hear Hernandez v. Mesa on Nov. 12. It\u2019s the second case of the day, scheduled immediately after the argument in a case on everyone\u2019s list, about the validity of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to rescind the protection of the DACA program for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, the \u201cdreamers\u201d who were brought to this country as children. The courtroom will be packed for the DACA argument. It may well empty out by the time Chief Justice John Roberts invites the Hernandezes\u2019 lawyer, Stephen Vladeck, to the lectern. But anyone lucky enough to have a seat in the courtroom for the DACA case should stay to see whether the promise of accountability offered by a Supreme Court on the verge of change a generation ago still holds for a Supreme Court in the midst of even deeper change today.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
