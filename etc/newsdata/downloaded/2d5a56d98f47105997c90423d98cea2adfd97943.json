His articles have appeared in the New York Times, Boston Globe and the BBC, among other outlets.\n\nOne day after POLITICO published a piece in which Jerry Falwell Jr. denied visiting a Miami Beach nightclub in July 2014 and alleged that any images showing such were \u201cphoto-shopped,\u201d a new trove of photos showing Falwell at the club has been released.\n\nSeth Browarnik, the owner of World Red Eye, a photography company that documents Miami\u2019s bustling nightlife scene, says he was unaware how many photos he had of Falwell until Falwell alleged that his site\u2019s images were manipulated\u2014prompting Browarnik to explore his photo archive to prove otherwise.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn Tuesday, Browarnik published the newly unearthed photos on his website, WorldRedEye.com, along with a strongly worded \u201crebuke\u201d of Falwell\u2019s claim of photoshopping.\n\n\u201cFirst things first,\u201d Browarnik told me over the phone, \u201cwe didn\u2019t even know [Falwell] was in the photos. Number one! Finding him in the crowd is like a \u2018Where\u2019s Waldo?\u2019\u201d\n\nBrowarnik lives high up in a South Beach skyrise, from which he can see the Falwell-owned Miami Hostel. Not that the owners of the flophouse crossed Browarnik\u2019s mind that often. He didn\u2019t even know his company had taken any photos of Liberty University\u2019s first family partying at Wall, a Miami Beach nightclub, until he saw them identified in the piece published by POLITICO yesterday.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, I scroll down and say, \u2018Oh my god!\u2019\u201d Browarnik said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an exclamation of excitement as much as indignance. In the article, Jerry Falwell Jr. repeatedly claimed that the photos\u2014which POLITICO obtained from World Red Eye, which World Red Eye has had on their website for five years, and which show Falwell partying at Wall on July 19, 2014\u2014were manipulated. \u201cIf the person in the picture is me, it was likely photo-shopped,\u201d Falwell said.\n\nBrowarnik said he felt insulted. \u201cMy integrity is everything in this business,\u201d he said.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor the past 21 years, Browarnik has photographed Miami nightlife. Because of his trusted reputation as a photographer, he thought it was important to quickly quash Falwell\u2019s accusation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have an archive of five million photos,\u201d Browarnik told me. \u201cThat\u2019s why we catalog everything.\u201d\n\nWhile reviewing images from the night in question, Browarnik discovered several previously unpublished photos from that evening in which Jerry Falwell Jr. and other members of the Falwell family can be seen\u2014including Jerry\u2019s wife, Becki, sons Trey and Wesley, and Trey\u2019s wife, Sarah. In the images, the Falwells can be seen in the middle of the club\u2019s dance floor while lasers and other light effects reflect around them. In at least two photos, Falwell family members can be seen holding alcohol. (Liberty University is notoriously strict about alcohol consumption, and students can receive demerits for co-ed dancing and be expelled for drinking.)\n\nA zoomed-in crop of the large nightclub dance floor photo at right reveals Jerry Falwell Jr., Becki Falwell and Wesley Falwell, among others. | Seth Browarnik/WorldRedEye.com\n\nBrowarnik told me that while the photographer who took the images of the Falwell family no longer works for his company, they took meticulous notes on the photo subjects, as all of his photographers do. Among those notes: the name Trey Falwell, which accompanied a photo of Sarah and Trey Falwell on World Red Eye\u2019s original post of the images in 2014.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t take [Trey\u2019s] name, it [would have been] non-existent,\u201d Browarnik exclaimed.\n\nIn the statement posted on WorldRedEye.com, Browarnik said he \u201cwholly reject[s] Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s baseless allegation \u2026 that one of our pictures was \u2018photo-shopped\u2019 or manipulated in any fashion.\u201d\n\nThe photos in question came to light in yesterday\u2019s article on Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s stewardship of Liberty University. During the reporting of that article, POLITICO contacted World Red Eye to purchase photographs showing Jerry and Trey Falwell at Wall nightclub in Miami.\n\nIn the statement published to his website today, Browarnik admitted to not knowing the reason for POLITICO\u2019s purchase. \u201cI was as surprised as anyone to discover that Mr. Falwell was among the partygoers we photographed on July 19, 2014 at WALL Lounge,\u201d he said.", "description": "Owner of Miami nightlife website finds additional images rebutting Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s claims of photoshopping.", "authors": ["William J.
