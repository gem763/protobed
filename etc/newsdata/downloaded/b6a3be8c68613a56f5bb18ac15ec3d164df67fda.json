However, JPMorgan is reluctant to begin serious negotiations before WeWork strikes a new deal with SoftBank, one source told the news outlet.\n\nSoftBank's money would finance WeWork's restructuring plans, Reuters reported. The Japanese conglomerate, which controls about 29% of WeWork and has invested or committed more than $10 billion already, has determined a fresh influx of cash is necessary to save its investment, one source told Reuters.\n\nBefore it coughs up the funds, however, SoftBank wants to tweak the $1.5 billion warrant deal it struck with WeWork in January based on the startup's private valuation of $47 billion at the time. It's eager to pay less per share, giving it a bigger stake in the business, the Financial Times reported last month.\n\nWeWork scrapped its plans to go public last month after investors criticized its business model, mounting losses, complex structure, and controversial cofounder and CEO Adam Neumann. Days before its IPO, the startup was looking at a public valuation below $20 billion \u2014 less than half its last private valuation. The prospect of raising less than $3 billion, the amount needed to unlock $6 billion in bank financing, prompted WeWork to shelve its plans.\n\nThe backlash from investors has led WeWork to overhaul its corporate governance, rejig its share structure, and replace Neumann with two co-CEOs, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham. The pair plan to lay off between 10% and 25% of the group's roughly 12,500 employees, Business Insider reported. They also intend to sell ancillary businesses that provide marketing, networking, and office\u2014cleaning services, according to The Information.\n\nRead more: WeWork is hitting the brakes after its IPO went up in smoke \u2014 and landlords could pay the price\n\nRead more: 'The emperor has no clothes': Billionaire debt investor Howard Marks slammed WeWork's business model and valuation", "description": "WeWork is reportedly seeking a $4 billion lifeline from SoftBank and JPMorgan.
