Our brands, both in beer and cider, are enjoying a high level of acceptance by South African consumers.\"\n\nHeineken does not provide exact numbers for each of the countries it operates in, but in the Dutch parent company's most recent financial results South Africa featured among the top performers. The flagship Heineken brand grew by double digits in SA, it said, while Amstel \"grew strongly\". Its cider business, which is headlined by Strongbow Apple Ciders, likewise reported strong growth in South Africa.\n\nBesides the direct investment in brewing Heineken said it is also working with South African suppliers to expand its malting capacity, so that it can use more locally processed barley.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Brewing a quarter more beer at its Sedibeng brewery will end up costing Dutch company Heineken and its Namibian partner R1 billion.
