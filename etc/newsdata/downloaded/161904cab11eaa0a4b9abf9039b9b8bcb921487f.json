As part of phase one, China will purchase between $40 billion and $50 billion in U.S. agricultural products.\n\nEvercore wrote that the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal doesn't clear the air for global corporations to decide on where to invest, produce hire or source. If the U.S. maintains a \"stop the China rise\" mentality perspective, the trade war will continue, the firm wrote.\n\n\"Trump's statement that 'We are near the end of the trade war' is not plausible to us,\" Evercore wrote in a note. \"We do not expect tariff cuts in 2020 \u2013 but are ready to be favorably surprised.\n\n\"And as long as such punitive tariffs remain, we would describe US-China economic relations as bad, not good.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs sees a 60% chance that the announced 15% tariffs will take effect, but expects a delay until early 2020 as opposed to the current deadline of Dec. 15. Evercore said it expects a delay and no additional tariff hikes in 2020.\n\nIn the past year, the U.S. has set tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese products, and China has retaliated with its own levies, igniting concern over slower global economic growth and weaker corporate earnings.\n\nJP Morgan said the first phase of the deal is a positive development after months of trade escalation, but that the outcome is not a surprise for the market. It expects that US-China tension could escalate again, especially during the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Investors had high hopes for some form of mini-deal in the weeks before the meeting, and Friday's announcement has at least been partially, if not fully, priced in,\" the firm wrote.\n\nMacro impact of the mini deal removes some downside risk in the next quarters, but does not affect the economic slowdown trend, JP Morgan wrote. The bank's growth forecasts are 6.2% in 2019 and 5.9% in 2020.", "description": "The U.S. had plans to hike duties on at least $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25% on Tuesday.
