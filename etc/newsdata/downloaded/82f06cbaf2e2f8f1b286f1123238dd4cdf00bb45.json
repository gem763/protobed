It wouldn't surprise me if this is 50 per cent of MoneyMe's value proposition in a very short time, it's growing that quick,\" Mr Howes added.\n\nVendors are charged an upfront 4 per cent fee on the money borrowed. After a 60-day interest-free period, they incur a 1.9 per cent fee each month on outstanding amount. The annualised rate works out to be about 23 per cent.\n\n\"You could definitely get quite a bang for your buck out of that loan if in theory you can borrow the money, market the property, sell it and pay back the loan in 60 days, but that is probably a long shot,\" Graham Cooke, insights manager at comparison website Finder, said.\n\n\"If you are going to take a long time to pay it off an old fashioned loan might be cheaper,\" he added.\n\nStaging and marketing a property is an important part of the sales process, but Mr Howes said a financing solution was one of the elements that had so far been missing.\n\nHomeowners should expect to spend between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of the value of their property on marketing as a guideline, Mr Cooke said, but warned that could encourage people to over-capitalise.\n\n\"If you're talking about the kind of budget for a $1 million home being $10,000 and suddenly someone says you can access $25,000 it may definitely be tempting to spend more.\"", "description": "Non-bank lender MoneyMe sees a huge opportunity in the real estate market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1945%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8c454ed9a34357ab53a0acecddb9ba45aec7f793", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
