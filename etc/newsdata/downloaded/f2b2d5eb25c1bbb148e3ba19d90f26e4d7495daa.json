I think we\u2019re very reticent about the opportunity. We think there\u2019s gonna be some significant opportunities, but what we don\u2019t see is the urgency.\u2019\n\nKeeping the powder dry is nothing new for Zell, who\u2019s been calling for a recession for a while now. \u201cIt very hard to sit there and not pull the trigger, but it\u2019s the guys who don\u2019t pull the trigger who are around to pull it when it works,\u201d he said last year, when he admitted to having $3.2 billion in cash.\n\nApparently, the pile\u2019s bigger now, and still he waits for the slowdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to have a recession when interest rates are zero,\u201d he told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m waiting for one is probably a positive sign because complacency is usually a major factor that leads to big surprises.\u201d\n\nZell has managed to keep his sense of humor about his misfires.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the real problem that pundits like you and me and her haven\u2019t been right about anything?\u201d he asked, referring to the guests on the CNBC panel. \u201cWe sit here and we predict that it\u2019s gonna be this, it\u2019s gonna be that, and we\u2019re worried about this and we\u2019re worried about that, and meanwhile the game keeps going.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview:\n\nAt last check, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.69% was bouncing back from Tuesday\u2019s decline with a triple-digit advance.", "description": "Earlier this year, Sam Zell, the billionaire chairman of Equity Group Investments, said President Donald Trump\u2019s continued push for interest-rate cuts could...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FV053_zell_ZG_20170926103858.jpg"}
