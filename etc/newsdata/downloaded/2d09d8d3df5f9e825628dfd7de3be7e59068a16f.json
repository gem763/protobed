It served to signal that his candidacy, which even some close confidants were unsure would continue in the first days after his health scare, had regained its footing.\n\nOver the past week, Sanders has restored his standing as a force in the fluid Democratic race with a debate performance that won positive reviews, high-profile endorsements and strong fundraising that has expanded a campaign account already flush with cash.\n\nAD\n\nYet his future in the race has been obscured by lingering questions about his age, health and ability to expand his support beyond a limited, if loyal, base all at a moment when former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are ahead of him in most polls.\n\nAD\n\nCampaign officials hope the addition of one of the party\u2019s biggest rising stars will help him jump-start his campaign headed into a crucial fall stretch. In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez delivered an impassioned explanation for why she decided to support Sanders, saying \u201cthe only reason that I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved you can run a grass-roots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought that was impossible.\u201d\n\nShe hugged Sanders after he walked onstage. The two then joined hands as the crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nAD\n\nOcasio-Cortez was part of a parade of introductory speakers, some of whom did not shy away from sensitive topics. The senator\u2019s wife, Jane Sanders, said her husband was healthy and eager to get back to the campaign. Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore dismissed the notion that Sanders\u2019s age is a liability and won cheers for saying that Wall Street would be the one having a heart attack when Sanders is elected.\n\nAD\n\nThe Sanders campaign has promised to release his health records by the end of the year. Sanders has not disclosed details about how much damage his heart sustained. And his team waited more than two days to reveal his diagnosis despite persistent questions from reporters, drawing some criticism and questions about transparency that Sanders has said were unwarranted.\n\nSanders\u2019s anti-establishment message and democratic socialist platform calling for sweeping expansion of the social safety net have made him a rock star on the party\u2019s left. But it has yet to gain traction among a broader slice of Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nSanders supporters are confident the endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez, an electrifying figure who is part of a youthful coalition of Democrats who rose to power in the 2018 midterms, will help address some of those weaknesses. Sanders also recently won the endorsement of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of an influential group of liberal congresswomen of color known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uniting different generations of Democrats,\u201d said Jonathan Glasser, 61, a South Orange, N.J., resident who attended the event. \u201cAnd it\u2019s momentum at a time when some people think his campaign is flagging because of his health issues. Him doing so great in the last debate was a really big thing.\u201d\n\nThe endorsements surprised many top Democrats who wondered whether they would throw their support to Warren, who is also running as a champion of liberal ideas, or stay neutral. But behind the scenes, Sanders worked diligently to secure their support, an effort that paid off at a moment he needed most.\n\nAD\n\nBryan Charlot, a 25-year-old from Manhattan, said he felt Sanders had gotten an unfair reputation that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement could remedy. \u201cEverybody thinks he hates women, so to have a prominent female voice out there on the trail for him will be good,\u201d Charlot said.\n\nAD\n\nSanders wrote his Saturday speech himself, aides said, honing it over the past couple of days. While he hit many of the populist themes he has long talked about, such as universal health care, he also touched on inclusivity, calling on supporters to fight for the needs of others.\n\n\u201cFind someone you don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe somebody who doesn\u2019t look like you,\u201d Sanders told the crowd as he wrapped up his remarks. \u201cMy question now for you is, \u2018Are you willing to fight for that person\u2019 \u201d as hard as you fight for yourself?\n\nAD\n\nSanders also accused some unnamed Democrats of believing \u201cthat real change is not possible,\u201d including some rivals he debated Tuesday night.\n\nWhile Sanders chose to make his return to the campaign trail in New York, he and his top aides are focusing heavily on another state. Campaign officials said Iowa, which kicks of the nomination contest on Feb. 3, is the priority in the coming weeks. The campaign intends to extend its current television ad buy there, and Sanders plans to kick off an \u201cEnd Corporate Greed Tour\u201d in a few days.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Sanders fought Hillary Clinton to a near draw in Iowa. But recent polls have shown him trailing Warren and Biden.\n\nAD\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally had a festive atmosphere. One man came dressed in an oversize Sanders mask and held up a sign that said \u201cEnough i$ Enough!\u201d The crowd broke into chants of \u201cWe will win!\u201d The distinct anti-establishment atmosphere that has been evident at Sanders\u2019s events this year was clear as speakers railed against large corporations to cheers. Outside, a handful of protesters waved Trump 2020 flags.\n\nFor some attendees, it was also an emotional moment. Few, if any, politicians have cultivated a core following as devoted as the one Sanders has built since his emergence on the national stage as a presidential candidate four years ago. His heart attack was a shock for many of them.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think, if anything, this is going to give him extra focus and more,\u201d said Alice Mosdell, 68, as she started tearing up. Her friend patted her on the back and finished her sentence for her. \u201cStronger than ever,\u201d said Maria Concilio, who wore a \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d Christmas sweater. \u201cAnd ready to make a difference,\u201d added Mosdell, who came from Millburn, N.J., wearing a Sanders T-shirt.\n\nAD\n\nSome in the crowd said they were not worried about any lingering effects of Sanders\u2019s heart attack. One sought to compare him favorably to Trump, who is 73 and has faced questions about his own health.\n\nCampaign officials and allies said the developments of the past week have created the feel of a fresh start that has boosted morale, renewed confidence, and helped the team move past the most difficult and uncertain phase of the campaign.\n\nAD\n\nThanks to a huge network of small-dollar donors, Sanders started October with $33.7 million in his campaign account, a hefty sum that ensures he will have the resources to compete in early states and is not in any danger of running low on cash in the near future.\n\nStill, questions remained about what tack Sanders will take in the months ahead. He has sent mixed signals about how aggressive his campaign schedule will be, after running at a breakneck pace for months. And at key times, he has declined to take the advice of his confidants, advisers and friends.\n\nSome of them are eager to see him sharpen the contrast that he has drawn with Biden and hear him speak more openly about his personal life, including his heart attack. On Saturday, Sanders seemed to heed their input, framing his health situation as a way to talk about what he says are severe economic, social and health-care issues facing people every day.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that I and my family have faced adversity this last couple of weeks, but the untold story is that people\u201d across the country are facing their own struggles, he said.\n\nSanders and his surrogates used the setting \u2014 a park across the river from Manhattan high-rises and across the street from the largest housing project in the country \u2014 to highlight the effects of income inequality and the reasons various government programs do not received their prescribed funding.\n\n\u201cIt is an outcome of a system that devalues the poor, that devalues working people, and that prioritizes buildings like those over buildings like these,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, as she pointed to the skyscrapers to her right, then the apartment buildings to her left, to make her point.", "description": "He drew a crowd of more than 25,000 \u2014 and the endorsement of rising star Ocasio-Cortez.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0n4jnc0_QgCBN_i2Do623RNvTgM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4EXHY2HSUUI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
