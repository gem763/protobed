More importantly, it caused the two men to die.\u2019\n\nPeter O\u2019Brien was killed in the explosion in Cardiff (Picture: Media Wales)\n\nThe force of the explosion lifted steel floor plates upwards at speeds of 40mph and hit the roof of the building some 46 feet above.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther workers tried to help the victims but were forced back by fire and smoke.\n\nElectrical engineer Darren Wood injured his hip and skull in the explosion while working on the floor above.\n\nMr Morgan said the workers should have received training to look out for faults with the system and assess the risks of operating the machinery.\n\nThe factory\u2019s health and safety manager Richard Bowen revealed he had concerns for safety during an interview.\n\nHe said some employees had \u2018little or no training\u2019 on risk assessments, and Celsa had not put in place steps to make sure workers carried them out.\n\nMr Bowen added: \u2018Prior to the accident there did not appear to be any corporate knowledge of process safety.\u2019\n\nMark Sim also died on November 18, 2015 (Picture: Media Wales)\n\nCelsa had failed to review working methods despite a smaller explosion occurring two years before the incident, the court heard.\n\nIt was also told the firm had breached health and safety legislation on five previous occasions between 2005 and 2009, with one occasion involving a death.\n\nRichard Matthews, defending, said the company accepted it had failed to identify risk of explosion when the oil tank was drained, saying: \u2018It was the cause of this tragedy and cause of these men\u2019s deaths, and the cause of the suffering and incalculable pain that has resulted.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018We underline that nothing that occurred was as a result of any failure or error or mistake of any sort on the men\u2019s part.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Neil Bidder criticised Celsa for not imposing a recognised set of instructions on how to safely drain the oil tank, describing its approach as \u2018simply a recipe for disaster\u2019.\n\nCelsa was ordered to pay a fine of \u00a31.8 million within six months.\n\nFollowing the hearing a spokesman for Celsa said in a statement: \u201cWe are truly sorry for the shortcomings which contributed to the most tragic event in our history.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
