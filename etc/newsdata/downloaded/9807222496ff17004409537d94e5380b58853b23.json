A spy submarine? An alien ship?\n\nThe case was classified as a UFO sighting and has gone down in history as one of Canada\u2019s great mysteries.\n\nNow that mystery has been immortalized on a coin \u2014 a glow-in-the-dark coin, in keeping with the spooky vibe.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mint \u2014 the corporation that makes all of Canada\u2019s coins on behalf of the government \u2014 started selling the rectangular, silver coins on Oct. 1.\n\nUnder black light, a glowing alien spacecraft appears on the rectangular, silver coin. (The Royal Canadian Mint)\n\nThe 4,000 coins were almost completely sold out by the end of the day, although some have been set aside to go to the public at the annual Shag Harbour UFO Festival, which begins in the small fishing village today.\n\nThe coins cost $129.95 each but would be worth $20 if you tried to use one in a store.\n\nWhen you use the black-light flashlight that comes with the coin, the outline of an alien spaceship appears and glows blue.\n\nNot only is Shag Harbour now home to a UFO interpretive centre and an annual festival, the fishing village has become a destination for tourists looking to buy UFO swag. (Steve Berry/CBC)\n\nWhat exactly did witnesses see in Shag Harbour on Oct. 4, 1967?\n\nMost reported seeing a series of flashing lights moving at high speed and then hitting the water.\n\nThen a glowing, orange, circular object \u2014 about the size of a city bus \u2014 sank under the water, witnesses said, leaving orange foam behind.\n\nA multi-day search of the harbour turned up nothing.\n\nStefan Michalak said he made this sketch after encountering a mysterious aircraft in the Manitoba woods in 1967 \u2014 the same year as Nova Scotia\u2019s Shag Harbour incident. (When They Appeared/Stan Michalak, Chris Rutkowski)\n\nCanadians report around 1,000 UFO sightings each year, ufologist Chris Rutkowski told the CBC earlier this year.\n\nThat\u2019s about three sightings a day.\n\nMost can be explained, but some \u2014 eight per cent in 2017 \u2014 remain mysteries, according to a report by Ufology Research, an organization Rutkowski belongs to, which analyzes Canadian UFO data.\n\nBut don\u2019t go buying supplies for your alien welcome party just yet!\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no incontrovertible evidence that aliens are visiting us, although it\u2019s a wonderful theory,\u201d Rutkowski said.\n\nIn 2018, the Royal Canadian Mint released the first coin in its \u2018unexplained phenomena\u2019 series, which focused on Manitoba\u2019s most famous UFO encounter. (The Royal Canadian Mint)\n\nThe Shag Harbour coin is the second in the Royal Canadian Mint\u2019s \u201cunexplained phenomena\u201d series.\n\nThe first, released in 2018, focused on Manitoba\u2019s most famous UFO encounter, which took place near Falcon Lake in 1967.\n\nAmateur geologist Stefan Michalak said he was searching for precious metals and gems in the woods when two saucer-shaped aircraft appeared in the sky.\n\nHe said he drew a picture, then approached the craft and touched it, only to be burned in the chest when it flew away.\n\nWith files from CBC Docs, Darren Bernhardt/CBC News, The Canadian Press", "description": "A new Canadian coin tells the story of a UFO sighting that took place off the coast of Shag Harbour, N.S., in 1967.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/UFOThumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
