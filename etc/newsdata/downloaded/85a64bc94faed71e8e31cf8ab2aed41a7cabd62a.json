Photo: Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nHaving your feet, neck, back or even scalp massaged is one of life\u2019s simple pleasures that can quickly become a very expensive habit, so if you\u2019ve ever wondered how to get a professional-grade massage at home for less, know that you\u2019re far from alone. That\u2019s part of the reason why our writers and editors have long been on the hunt for the best massage tools that you can buy online, and use yourself in the comfort of your own home, from mechanical rollers to heated Shiatsu-massagers. (We\u2019ve also learned that back massagers make great gifts for almost any person on your list.) So whether you\u2019re looking for an NBA-player endorsed massage gun, or a chiropractor-recommended back massager, here are some of the best massage tools that we\u2019ve written about on the Strategist.\n\nBest electric back massager\n\nZyllion Shiatsu Back Neck Massager $45 (was $100, now 55% off) This well-reviewed back and neck massager is so effective that many Amazon customers say that it has replaced their massage therapists. In fact, one satisfied reviewer calls it \u201cmaybe my best Amazon purchase of the year,\u201d describing the massage pressure as \u201cperfect and the heat option takes it over the top!\u201d We\u2019ve also featured the Zyllion back massager in a couple of our gift guides, and it\u2019s since become a reliable favorite for hard-to-shop-for men and dads with aches and pains. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest portable electric back massager\n\nEtekcity Rechargeable Back Neck Massager with Heat Function After hearing about the massager that had been recommended to a bevy of L.A. celebrities, like Moon Juice founder Amanda Chantal Bacon and actress Dree Hemingway, Natalie Toren tried out this Etekcity back and neck massager at designer Leslie Aitken\u2019s studio and was sold. It felt to her \u201cas if real human fists were kneading me\u201d and the massage nodes were comparable to \u201chot stones a masseuse might use for an actual spa treatment.\u201d After learning that this massager was under $50 Toren bought one right then and there, and now uses it all over her body, four or five times a day. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest massage pillow\n\nBest electric foot massager\n\nMiko Shiatsu Foot Massager With Deep-Kneading, Multi-Level Settings, And Switchable Heat Charcoal $120 (was $250, now 52% off) This Shiatsu foot massager has long been a bestseller among Strategist readers, a popular gift for boyfriends, girlfriends, and dads alike. But it\u2019s also well-reviewed on Amazon, with over 1,100 five star reviews, including one from a professional massage therapist who vouches that it \u201chits all the meridian trigger points\u201d and relaxes your entire body. $120 at Amazon Buy $120 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest non-electric foot massager\n\nTheraFlow Dual Foot Massager Roller $17 (was $30, now 43% off) Manual massage purists and reformed electric massage users are among the thousands of Amazon reviewers to give the manual TheraFlow foot massager five stars. \u201cI hate to say it, but I think it does a better job than my fancy Shiatsu massager,\u201d writes one sheepish reviewer. The roller is also celebrated by many people with sore feet for its fast-acting pain relief. One reviewer who had \u201cbecome a hermit\u201d due to their foot pain, noticed a \u201chuge difference\u201d after using this massager for just one day at work. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest foot massage ball\n\nDue North Foot Rubz Massage Ball Dr. Lori Weisenfeld, D.P.M, a New York City sports podiatrist, hears rave reviews from patients about this spiky massage ball. For people with foot pain the \u201clittle nubbies massage the arch,\u201d she explains, and the rolling motion is good \u201cfor people with tight, taught muscles and arch and heel pain.\u201d The compact, $7 ball has also impressed hundreds of Amazon reviewers, earning our pick as best-rated, less expensive foot massage tool. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest electric hand-held massage tool\n\nTheragun G3PRO This $600 Theragun is said to decrease pain due to its intense vibrations and unparalleled range of motion, which is why many professional athletes (like Kyrie Irving) have gone to bat for the muscle-relaxing magic of this must-have workout accessory. Mark Hunter, a.k.a. the party photographer Cobrasnake, and now founder of the Instagram-famous Cobra Fitness Club, uses the Theragun multiple times a day, and says it keeps him going \u201clonger and stronger,\u201d without trips to a massage therapist. $599 at Amazon Buy $599 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest less-expensive electric hand-held massage tool\n\nBlack & Decker WP900 Random Orbit Waxer/Polisher For people who are looking for a powerful hand-held massage tool without the $600 price tag, Maggie Coughlan recommends this Black & Decker power tool. Although it\u2019s designed for automotive polishing projects, Coughlan insists that it operates like \u201cwhat a foam roller wants to be when it grows up\u201d and soothes body-wide tension with a simultaneous spin-and-vibrate motion. Plus, it has a following among Amazon reviewers, Reddit commenters, and Strategist readers alike. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest mechanical muscle massager\n\nThera Cane Massager In the great Strat muscle massager face-off of 2017 our columnist Chris Black extolled the virtues of the Thera Cane Massager. Despite being an \u201cearly adopter\u201d of the foam-roller, he insisted that his back has \u201cnever felt better\u201d than after using this J-shaped device equipped with six treatment balls, which target specific muscles for maximum pain-relief. Black\u2019s claims are supported by massage therapist David Vargas who recommended the Thera Cane as a perfect non-mechanical pick for dad\u2019s with aching backs. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest mechanical muscle massager for athletes\n\nOriginal Tiger Tail Massage Stick 18\" On the other side of the muscle massager face-off was the Tiger Tail: a large, non-mechanical muscle massager that Rima Suqi swears by for rolling out muscles\u2014in a \u201churt-so-good\u201d way\u2014after her intense, three-times-a-week weight classes. Among athletes, Suqi isn\u2019t alone in her adoration of this roller. Here at the Strategist the Tiger Tail has been named among the best workout accessories, and is a device that has gotten writer, and five time marathon runner, Karen Iorio Adelson through hundreds of miles of training. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest foam roller\n\nBest vibrating foam roller\n\nHyperice Vyper 2.0 High-Intensity Vibrating Fitness Roller Another expert-recommended foam roller is the HyperIce Vyper, which is celebrated by personal trainers and chiropractors for it\u2019s muscle penetrating and pain-alleviating vibrations. Celebrity personal trainer Danny Musico noted that the Vyper has multiple levels of vibration \u201cso it gets deeper into muscles than any other foam roller I\u2019ve used.\u201d $199 at Amazon Buy $199 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest acupressure mat\n\nProSource Fit Acupressure Mat and Pillow Set When writer Lori Keong was experiencing back and neck pain so intense that no amount of stretching or rubbing helped, her roommate tipped her off to this acupressure mat. Like acupuncture this mat relieves pain through \u201ctouch and pressure,\u201d but unlike acupuncture it is non-invasive and inexpensive. Keong admits that the spiky mat is \u201can acquired comfort\u201d but after five or six minutes of use she found \u201cthat the soreness had mysteriously melted away and didn\u2019t return. I could roll my arms back and forth without any lingering tension \u2014 something I hadn\u2019t been able to do for days.\u201d $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest acupressure rings\n\nImpresa \"Spiky Sensory\" Acupressure Ring Set Sales director and beauty insider Yana Shept has known about the physical relief of energy-diffusing medicine, namely acupuncture and acupressure, since she was 7 years old. But, she didn\u2019t discover these acupressure rings that double as \u201cself-care fidget spinners\u201d until a couple of years ago. A few rolls on her finger and they help her feel less stressed, stay focused, and mitigate headaches. She writes: \u201cThe tingling pain the ring imparts when you roll it took my attention away from the headache, and I suddenly started feeling better \u2014 like my body was slowly balancing back to normal.\u201d $9 for 10 at Amazon Buy $9 for 10 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest scalp massager\n\nMarvy Shampoo and Scalp Brush Although this is not a typical massage tool, writer Alison Freer swears that using this Marvy scalp brush is a \u201cblissful\u201d experience akin to \u201cgetting a scalp massage at the hair salon (with extremely firm fingers.)\u201d Thanks to flexible, rubber bristles that deliver a perfectly pressured massage, this pack of two brushes has totally eradicated her dry, patchy scalp skin. $8 for 2 at Amazon Buy $8 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest massage chair\n\nKahuna Massage Chair Space-Saving Zero-Gravity Full-Body Recliner In the world of massage tools, massage chairs are the litmus test of excellence, but they aren\u2019t often described as compact or cheap \u2014 which makes the Kahuna Zero-Gravity Full-Body Recliner something of an exception. In addition to its \u201csimply blissful\u201d comfort and coziness, many Amazon customers give the chair rave reviews for it\u2019s \u201csmall footprint.\u201d Granted, at a $2,000 price tag the full-body recliner is hardly inexpensive, but it costs four times less than another Kahuna chair, which was the most expensive Strategist purchase of 2018. $2,000 at Amazon Buy $2,000 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
