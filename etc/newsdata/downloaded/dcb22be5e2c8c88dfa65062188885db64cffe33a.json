In terms of economic growth, it seems the strategy of boosting infrastructure projects is also working.\n\nTrade tensions have escalated\n\nAs we said in the July monthly note, it was hard to see a summer lull in the trade war. The trade war escalated on 23rd August when China surprised the market by retaliating American 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods. The retaliation came in so late that the market had forgotten that China could retaliate.\n\nChina\u2019s retaliation of 5%-25% on $750billion worth of US imports was indeed small, but it definitely caught the market and President Trump off guard, which lead to the Trump Administration hastily reacting with an additional round of 5% tariffs.\n\nOur latest CNY outlook\n\nEven though the two sides have scheduled talks in October, we don\u2019t believe there will be fruitful results from it. As such, we have revised our forecasts from 7.10, 7.00 and 6.90 previously, to 7.20, 7.30 and 7.20 by the end of 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. However, we forecast a trading range of 7.05-7.50 for the rest of 2019.\n\nThis is partly because we don\u2019t expect meaningful outcomes from trade talks in 2019, so we don\u2019t expect to go back below 7.00. If there is positive news from the trade talks, USD/CNY could possibly return to 6.8-6.9 but the chances are very low.\n\nThe 7.50 upper bound of our forecast range could also create further market chaos, just as was the case when crossed 7.00. Creating sudden market chaos could be the Chinese strategy to upset President Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nEconomy receiving support from infrastructure stimulus\n\nOn the economy, China\u2019s infrastructure stimulus projects appear to be making good progress. China\u2019s industrial profits turned positive in the latest data, mostly because of the support from infrastructure projects, which pushes up profits in the mining sector and electrical product sector.\n\nWe believe that infrastructure projects can support the economy to achieve the 6% GDP target.\n\nThe Chinese cabinet has already signaled that the PBoC should cut the required reserve ratio- RRR - to provide more liquidity to suppress the increasing interest rate trend, as there are an increased amount of local government special bonds to be issued.\n\nFig 1 and Fig 2\n\nHowever it seems that the central bank is reluctant to flood liquidity into the system. It wants to make sure that the liquidity flows to infrastructure projects and smaller exporters. This could only be done via the banks\u2019 tracking after the loans are drawn down.\n\nDisclaimer: This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.
