I love you,\u201d he told me. But I never got a grip around that. That\u2019s when I got these [implants].\n\n\u2018I thought I\u2019d have this fantastic bust and everyone would look at me and think I was amazing.\n\nShirley is now planning on getting her breast implants removed (Picture: ITV/Rex)\n\n\u2018After the operation I did feel fantastic: I\u2019d put a bra on and I had a cleavage.\u2019\n\nHowever, the 59-year-old later became more appreciative of her more natural, smaller bust since she started dating acting Danny Taylor.\n\n\u2018It isn\u2019t until you\u2019re at peace with yourself that everything about you is beautiful. So what if you\u2019ve got a smaller bust? I think it\u2019s only since I\u2019ve been with Danny that I\u2019ve realised that,\u2019 she added.\n\nThis comes as Shirley is set to have her breast implants removed after being told by a healthcare professional during a mammogram that it might not be possible to check for cancer behind the implants.\n\nThe Strictly judge is set to have the implants removed by the end of October, and she believes that they have been the cause of her chronic fatigue as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There are rumours that scar tissues cause chronic fatigue which I have suffered with even over the last year,\u2019 she previously told The Sun.\n\n\u2018But if they take out the scar tissue it would involve bigger surgery and perhaps a reconstruction. But I don\u2019t want any implants in. I don\u2019t want any foreign bodies in my body.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
