But then self-reported a DQ", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nIf you scroll down the list of the finishers from the Indiana High School Athletic Association girls golf state finals, eventually you find Kiah Parrott. The Kokomo senior is listed last, under 99 other names, though there is no official number next to her name. Her final score, officially, is \u201cDQ.\u201d\n\nParrott, unofficially, finished sixth on Saturday at Prairie View Golf Course in Carmel, Indiana. It was her dream, in her third state finals appearance, to finish on the podium with a top-10 finish for the first time. And she did it, after shooting with 6-over-par 78 in the first round on Friday, with a 2-under 70 on Saturday.\n\nSixth place was secure. The hard work was done, a birdie on her final hole to cap her high school golf career. And then, well, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nNFL WEEK 5 WINNERS, LOSERS: Christian McCaffrey posting big numbers for Panthers; Jets, not so much\n\nNCAA 1-130 RE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1\n\nKokomo's Kiah Parrott (Photo: Provided photo)\n\nParrott, after eating lunch, noticed that the live scoring app had her at plus-3 for the tournament instead of plus-4. At first, she believed it was an error on the app. Then, after checking her official scorecard again, Parrott\u2019s stomach dropped. She had signed an incorrect scorecard.\n\nIn the moment, the 17-year-old was faced with a conundrum: She could play along, knowing the score was incorrect by one stroke. Parrott would have tied for fifth with the incorrect score, five shots behind state champion Faith Johnson. Or, she could turn herself in.\n\n\u201cThere was no way anyone else would have known,\u201d Parrott said Monday.\n\nBut Parrott knew. She had a bogey on the par-4 No. 10. She wrote a \u201c5.\u201d But her playing partner, Heritage Christian\u2019s Yanah Rolston, had put down a \u201c4.\u201d Parrott does not blame Rolston \u2014 not at all. When they sat down after the round to double-check the scores, Parrott made a mistake by not looking over the scorecard more closely.\n\n\u201cObviously I knew I was going to turn myself in,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cI knew I was going to be disqualified. But there was no other option. I don\u2019t like it when other people cheat and if I didn\u2019t tell anyone, I would have been cheating. It would have made me feel worse. I knew what I really shot and I would just have to live with that. It was my error.\u201d\n\nThat does not mean there were not tears shed on the drive home. There were. Her father knew it was a \u201cbitter pill\u201d to swallow. He had seen the smile on her face after the birdie putt on 18. To go from that moment to this might have seemed brutally unfair. But on Sunday night, after the emotions had 24 hours to subside, Steve shared with his daughter an even more special moment.\n\n\u201cI told her there is no question there is a bigger picture than standing on the podium,\u201d he said. \u201cHer dream was finishing on the podium. The dream for her mom (Amanda) and I is for her to have integrity and character. She\u2019s fulfilled that. Five years from now, she will be able to sit down in a job interview and explain to someone what she did as a 17-year-old.\u201d\n\nAll was not lost for Kiah, who will play golf at Ball State. Based on her play over the course of the season, she was still named to the all-state team. And there has been a tremendous outpouring of support from peers and others in the golf community for her decision on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to live with myself knowing I would have cheated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely a good lesson learned. And I know any tournament I play in from now on, I\u2019m going to triple-check my scorecard.\u201d\n\nFollow Kyle Neddenriep on Twitter @KyleNeddenriep", "description": "Kiah Parrott would have finished state finals tied for fifth.
