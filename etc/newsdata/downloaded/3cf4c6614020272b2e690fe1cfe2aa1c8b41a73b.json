Formally withdrawing it is far more consequential, as the bill\u2019s sponsors would have to start all over again to reintroduce it.\n\nRelated: Cathay Pacific\u2019s chairman, John Slosar, said he would resign, becoming the second high-level executive at the flagship carrier to step down, amid Beijing\u2019s growing pressure against Hong Kong companie s. The company characterized his departure as retirement.\n\nFirst protest-linked death confirmed in Kashmir\n\nA 16-year-old boy died on Tuesday, weeks after witnesses said security officers aiming at protesters hit him in the face with buckshot. It was the first such death to be officially confirmed in the restive region since the Indian government abruptly revoked its limited autonomy a month ago.\n\nThe teenager, Asrar Ahmed Khan, had just finished playing cricket on the evening of Aug. 6 when security forces opened fire on a crowd. Security forces have now barricaded his neighborhood, bracing for another outbreak of protests.\n\nOn the ground: The region remains locked down. Most phones still do not work. Shops are shuttered, soldiers wearing metal face masks stand on nearly every corner and along every lane, and few children attend school. Thousands of people have been detained without charges, including teachers, rights activists and political and business leaders.", "description": "A no-go on a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Alisha Haridasani Gupta"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/briefing/05briefing-asia-slide-B0GC-copy/05briefing-asia-slide-B0GC-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
