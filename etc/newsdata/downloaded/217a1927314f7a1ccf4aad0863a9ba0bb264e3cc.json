That aside, Maserati has done a better job than most of subtly updating an older model under the skin.\n\nAs the sole naturally aspirated V8 left in the range, the GranTurismo is old school in a very visceral and appealing way, but its days of passing emission legislation are drawing to a close. It moves and growls like very few new cars still on sale; its mighty acceleration is linear and its stupendous roar bounces off the rock faces as it wends its way up into the Dolomites.\n\nViews of the Dolomites peek out between the historic buildings of Cortina d'Ampezzo's main square. Shutterstock\n\nMany of the dwellings we pass are Austrian in appearance, with white walls and dark wooden balconies lined with flowerpots. That\u2019s no surprise, as this is a borderland and the frontiers have shifted back and forth throughout history.\n\nCortina d\u2019Ampezzo must be one of the few towns in the world sponsored by a car company. Audi supposedly pays \u20ac1.5 million a year to have its name and four rings all over the spectacular alpine village, and one of its e-tron electric SUVs is on permanent display in the historic square.\n\nWith its copious views of iconic peaks between the historic buildings, Cortina is the place to be, and to be seen, for the fashionable Italian set in winter. It\u2019s famed for its skiing but increasingly it is a summer wonderland too, with the lure of walking, climbing and biking. There are plenty of fine restaurants, art galleries and high-end shops. Only beautiful people seem to be allowed in, but I manage to find a loophole \u2013 probably helped by my set of wheels.\n\nThe Dolomites are a playground for adventure seekers all year round.\n\nA Maserati, Ferrari or Lamborghini attracts far more attention in Italy than in Australian capital cities. National pride comes into it, as does rarity. With premium fuel more than $3 a litre, and average wages relatively low, it\u2019s no surprise most exotic Italian cars are exported. Our red GranTurismo gains hearty waves from schoolkids through to grandparents, even in ritzy Cortina.\n\nIt is here, however, that I swap four wheels for two, at least temporarily. While the bitumen roads offer Tour de France-style climbs, this is also superb mountain-biking terrain. I stick to the train line; since the rails were removed in the 1960s, the route has been converted for hiking and biking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the latter it is superb, because the gradient is consistent and relatively small (somewhere between 2.5 and 5 per cent on average). The climb is relentless though. The trail takes you through old tunnels, past abandoned stations and over spectacular bridges with raging rivers way below. Many of the tunnels and bridges were built by the opposing Austrian and Italian armies during World War I.\n\nThe densely packed pines can be 30 or 40 metres tall. I regularly collide with butterflies while pedalling, adding to the slightly hyper-real mountain experience.\n\nCortina d\u2019Ampezzo comes into view. iStockphoto\n\nIt takes about two leisurely, uphill hours to arrive at the Chalet Passo Cimabanche for a very Germanic lunch before continuing the ride just a little further into South Tyrol, Italy\u2019s northern-most province. If you take the uphill pain first, it\u2019s a very fast and exciting ride back down to Cortina, with the bike moving about quite a bit on the soft surface.\n\nBut back to the road. The motoring gods are smiling \u2013 a string of classic cars are among us, competing in the annual Coppa D\u2019Oro delle Dolomiti. This was once a flat-out road race, but is now completed by pre-1972 cars at a relatively relaxed clip. Even among the Porsches, Lancias, Alvises and Delehayes, one car still stands out: a spectacular Cisitalia Spider 202 SMM, just like the one that legendary Italian driver Tazio Nuvolari drove in the 1947 Mille Miglia endurance race.\n\nThe road is an amazing feat of engineering, cutting through the cores of mountains and alongside them.\n\nThe Great Dolomites Road to Bolzano is one I\u2019ve done before and it ranks up with the best of the best, even by Dolomites standards. It is an amazing feat of engineering, traversing extraordinary changes in elevation and direction, past forests, high over rivers, cutting through the cores of mountains and alongside them, on cantilevered roads with only low stone fences standing between control and oblivion. There are rock faces everywhere, and sometimes the view stretches on forever \u2013 down, down, down.\n\nWith some road works on this occasion, I elect not to go all the way to the end, doubling back and returning via the lake villages of Masare and Alleghe. Many of the towns have at least two names to cover the various dialects of Austrian, Italian and Ladin used in these parts.\n\nThe Great Dolomites Road to Bolzano features numerous bends with super-sharp hairpins.\n\nAt one stage we climb through 29 numbered bends over seven or eight kilometres, except many of the bends aren\u2019t considered tight enough to rate a number from whoever writes the signs. Those that are include hairpins almost too sharp to take in one lock, and the real number of shifts hard left to right to left are too great to count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Maserati\u2019s front tyres and brakes receive an even harsher workout on the way down (it\u2019s too good a stretch to do only once) and acquit themselves well. The GranTurismo is extraordinarily well planted in such winding terrain, although there is no getting around from how wide it feels on such narrow roads. It makes for quite a physical drive, albeit an entertaining and rewarding one.\n\nAgain, if there are better driving roads anywhere in the world, it\u2019s a well-kept secret.\n\nAt a glance\n\nCortina d\u2019Ampezzo This resort town is about two hours by road from the nearest international airport, Venice Marco Polo, and about 2.5 hours from Austria\u2019s Innsbruck Airport.\n\nThis resort town is about two hours by road from the nearest international airport, Venice Marco Polo, and about 2.5 hours from Austria\u2019s Innsbruck Airport.
