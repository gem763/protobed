Not 100 percent, but actually 1,000 percent,\u201d Mr. Zelensky gushed, according to a reconstructed transcript of the call the White House released on Wednesday.\n\nWhen Mr. Zelensky said Ukraine was almost ready to purchase American Javelin anti-tank missiles so it could better repel armored assaults by Russian-supported fighters, Mr. Trump pounced.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d Mr. Trump responded, beginning a series of pointed requests. The president pressed Mr. Zelensky to use the help of Attorney General William P. Barr in opening an investigation of a company involved in the beginnings of the F.B.I. inquiry of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. He also wanted a corruption investigation connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival.", "description": "The president pressed Ukraine\u2019s leader on potential investigations that could benefit him politically.", "authors": ["Michael D.
