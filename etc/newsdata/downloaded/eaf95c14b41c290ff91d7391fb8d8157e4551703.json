He has not had access to a lawyer nor the chance to see his family or access medical care.\n\nIn a letter sent to Cuban second-in-command Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, Amnesty International accuses the communist regime of having \u201charassed and intimidated Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda for more than a decade due to his political activism,\u201d adding that his detention \u201cfollows the naming by Amnesty International of six prisoners of conscience in less than two months.\u201d\n\nAmnesty notes that Ferrer is currently being held in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, where his organization is based. According to his wife, his health remains precarious, having developed chronic gastroenteritis developed during his prior eight years in prison for pro-democracy activism. Authorities are reportedly refusing to provide him with medical care or receive medication paid and provided for by his family.\n\nThe human rights group goes on to demand that the regime \u201cimmediately inform Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda of the charges or otherwise release him, ensure he has immediate access to a lawyer of his choosing and can communicate with his family; [and] ensure he has prompt access to a proper medical examination, if requested \u2013 and to medical care on request or as necessary throughout the period of detention.\u201d\n\nFerrer\u2019s partner, Nelva Ismarays Ortega, said in an interview with Reuters that police threatened to charge him with a fabricated common crime so he would not be heralded as a political prisoner.\n\n\u201cThey told him they were fed up with his activism \u2026 and that they were very uncomfortable with how he\u2019d supported the measures of the U.S. government against the Castro regime,\u201d Ortega told the agency. \u201cHe was in a lot of pain. But he said he wasn\u2019t afraid, and he was prepared to spend more years in jail as long as the truth were known.\u201d\n\nThe arrest also comes less than two months after Cuban police raided the UNPACU headquarters in Santiago while also arresting Ferrer. Following his release, he soon took to the streets again to participate in mass demonstrations to honor Cuba\u2019s patron saint, Our Lady of Charity, and demand a transition to democracy as the country moves towards a post-Castro era.\n\nAuthorities arrested over 100 pro-democracy dissidents following the demonstration, many of whom accused security forces of raiding their homes and stealing items that are hard to access such as milk and cooking oil. Those who were not detained suffered heavy fines for unsubstantiated crimes such as \u201charm to the environment\u201d or involvement in an unlawful protest. Cuba routinely uses these fines to imprison dissidence once they fail to pay, not being able to afford them.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Cuba's communist regime recently detained the leader of the country's largest dissident group and has yet to release him.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Jose-Daniel-Ferrer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
