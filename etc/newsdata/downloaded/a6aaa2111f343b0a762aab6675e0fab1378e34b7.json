Like, without a doubt, that\u2019d be funny. I\u2019m not asking for that; I don\u2019t want that to happen, but it would be funny to see. He\u2019d be on stage talking (expletive), the shooter would be coming at him, and he\u2019d be like, \u2018Sit down.\u2019 He\u2019d definitely make a funny noise when he got hit. \u2026 It would be funny.\u201d\n\nGillis closed out his set by calling out \u201cwoke\u201d culture, saying how he is \u201cwhite trash\u201d from Pennsylvania and has friends and family on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny to hear so many people these days say, \u2018I\u2019m not racist,\u2019 \u201d Gillis said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, are you sure? Being racist isn\u2019t like a yes or no thing. It\u2019s not like you do or you don\u2019t have it. Being racist is like being hungry: It\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re not right now, but a cheeseburger could cut you off in traffic and you could get hungry real quick. You didn\u2019t even know you were hungry for that type of cheeseburger.\u2019 The cheeseburger is not Asian in that joke.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Usatoday.Com Story Entertainment Tv Shane-Gillis-Jokes-Funny-Trump-Assassination-Post-Snl-Firing"], "top_image": ""}
