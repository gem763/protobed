As a result we have under-funded schools and colleges.'\n\nFigures from the Department for Education (DfE) show 14.6 per cent of pupils had SEND last year, while in 2016 and 2017 it was 14.4 per cent.\n\nThe proportion had been falling since 2010, when it peaked at more than 20 per cent. This year's data also gave a breakdown of the types of special needs children had.\n\nThe largest group \u2013 22 per cent \u2013 were those with 'speech, language and communications needs', followed by 20 per cent with 'moderate learning difficulty' and 17 per cent with 'social, emotional and mental health' needs.\n\nThere were 11 per cent with autistic spectrum disorder (an umbrella term which includes autism and Asperger syndrome), while less than 5 per cent had a physical disability or were blind or deaf.\n\nIt said children having issues picked up on correctly as well as earlier \u2013 and a higher survival rate for severely disabled children thanks to medical advances \u2013 had led to the increase (file photo)\n\nThe data come after education watchdog Ofsted raised fears in 2010 that many pupils were being misdiagnosed with mild SEND when they just needed better pastoral support.\n\nIn 2011, the Government moved to tackle 'over-diagnosis' and numbers fell but now the trend is in reverse.\n\nThe committee noted the Government recently promised much more support for children with SEND, but this has not properly materialised.\n\nSelect committee chairman Robert Halfon said: 'The DfE cannot continue with a piecemeal and reactive approach to supporting children with SEND... What is needed is a transformation, a more strategic oversight and fundamental change to ensure a generation of children is no longer let down.'\n\nA DfE spokesman said: 'No child should be held back from reaching their potential... That's why we recently announced a \u00a3780million increase to local authorities' high needs funding, boosting the budget by 12 per cent and bringing the total spent on supporting those with the most complex needs to over \u00a37billion for 2020-21.'", "description": "A report from the education select committee has found 14.9 per cent of UK pupils are registered as needing extra support at school this year, following a rise over the past two years.", "authors": ["Eleanor Harding Education Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20059960-0-image-a-50_1571785351133.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
