For example, the idea behind the death penalty is, in part, that executing people will dissuade others from committing such heinous crimes. That\u2019s the goal.\n\nHowever, sometimes the enforcement may actually push people into behaving very differently than originally intended.\n\nA case last week in Connecticut is just such an example.\n\nSgt. Jennifer Pinto said police were called to Reynolds Avenue at about 8:30 a.m. Tuesday on a report of a car burglary that involved a stolen gun. The owner of the car, Christopher Jerome, 26, parked his car at about 8:20 p.m. Monday and, thinking that he was going to get back into the car a short time later, did not lock the doors. When he got up the next morning, Jerome saw that his driver\u2019s side door was open and his gun had been taken out of the unlocked glove box, Pinto said. Jerome presented his pistol permit to officers and told them that he had more firearms in his home.\n\nSo Jerome was the victim of a crime. Yes, he made a big mistake in not securing the firearm, but he did the responsible thing in owning up to the mistake.\n\nAs a result, he was charged with reckless endangerment.\n\nWay to reinforce responsible behavior, folks. That wasn\u2019t all, either.\n\nBecause of the circumstances of the theft, police went into the home and took the guns, a semiautomatic Glock pistol, another handgun and a semi-automatic AR-15. Under a new law that went into effect Oct. 1, Jerome was charged with a misdemeanor count of unsafe storage of a gun in a motor vehicle in addition to the reckless endangerment charge. The new law makes it a crime to store a gun in a locked car if it is not also put into a safe, locked in the glove box or stored in the car\u2019s trunk.\n\nSo now what will happen when people learn about what happened to Jerome?\n\nEasy. They\u2019ll either refuse to contact the police about stolen guns or they\u2019ll lie and argue the car was locked or the gun was secured with a gun lock but stolen anyway.\n\nMore than likely, many will simply refuse to report the guns stolen. They\u2019ll feign ignorance or come up with some other kind of excuse if it\u2019s later learned their gun ended up in the wrong hands, but they\u2019re not going to admit to having made a mistake. Why risk it?\n\nNo, that\u2019s probably not the best thing to do, but can you blame them?\n\nJerome had a lapse in judgment. As a result, he\u2019s not only facing charges but was completely disarmed without any conviction or suggestion that he represents a threat to society.\n\nThat is a huge problem, yet this is what the anti-gunners want. They want to make it so any single mistake can be twisted and turned into justification to disarm us. People are human, they make mistakes. That\u2019s all Jerome did, and now look where he is. On some level they want all of us to either be put in that exact same spot or so terrified to be there that we basically neuter ourselves by never taking our guns out of our safe.\n\nThere\u2019s literally nothing right about this kind of thing.\n\nRemember when victim-blaming was a bad thing? That never actually applied to us, though, now did it?", "description": "A Connecticut man is charged with reckless endangerment and has had his guns confiscated after a handgun was stolen out of his car.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
