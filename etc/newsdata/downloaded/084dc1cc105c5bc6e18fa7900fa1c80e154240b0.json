We\u2019ve always known he\u2019s an exceptional athlete, but at the moment he\u2019s at the peak of his powers,\u201d Hansen said of Savea. \u201cHe\u2019s really confident, it doesn\u2019t matter where he plays.\u201d\n\nThe versatile backrower was arguably the best player in Yokohama that night. Certainly, his first half was outstanding while the All Blacks were struggling to make headway against the Springboks. Savea was bulldozing, twisting, and heaving through double and triple tackles with four immense carries that gave his team precious yardage past the gainline.\n\nHe also featured in both All Blacks\u2019 tries, ranging inside winger Sevu Reece - \u201cHe was running way faster than me,\u201d Reece says - and Aaron Smith to take the ball 30 meters into the Boks 22 before the first try, and drew three defenders to him on the right touchline in the leadup to the second.\n\nHis performance makes it all the more remarkable considering he\u2019s been playing with poor vision in one eye and will wear goggles against Canada on Wednesday in Oita. The All Blacks have noticed for a while that he\u2019s been blinking a lot in trainings and games, and Savea has finally decided to look after his worsening eye.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right move for Ardie and it\u2019s great that it helps protect an area that other people have an issue with, and it\u2019s a great message (that he can play),\u201d assistant coach Ian Foster says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a concern for us, from a point of view that we\u2019re not surprised. He\u2019s been dealing with it for a few years. We\u2019ve got a great medical staff so we trust all the research they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nSavea will be on the reserves bench on Wednesday for the first time in a year. He\u2019s been a reserve for the majority of his 40 tests. He came off the bench in his first five tests, for 10 of his 12 in 2016, and eight of his 10 in 2017. In the flankers\u2019 pecking order, he was below Jerome Kaino, Cane, Matt Todd, Liam Squire, and Shannon Frizell.\n\nBut the retirement of Kaino and injuries to the others gave Savea an opening and, since his match-winning try off a maul against the Springboks a year ago in Pretoria, he\u2019s become first choice.\n\nBeing a starter rather than a replacement, when he often tried too hard to do too much in too little time, has made a difference.\n\n\u201cAt one point, he was the impact player off the bench,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cBut his stamina and his strength as he\u2019s matured now allows him to do the special things he does for 80 minutes. That puts pressure on everyone else to come to his standards.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re standards that have garnered Savea comparisons with the great Michael Jones, who was considered a freak when he emerged in the mid-80s; a flanker who wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the centers. Savea\u2019s ability to excel in jersey No. 6, 7 or 8 - and who knows, maybe 12, 13, or Reece\u2019s 14 - prompted Australia coach Michael Cheika to call him a \u201chybrid.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s leadership potential, too. Savea captained his school 1st XV, New Zealand Schools, and Wellington province. He also launched a self-named clothing line with wife Saskia in 2017. She manages the brand and he designs and models the T-shirts, hoodies, shorts and pants with phrases on them about being \u201cYounique.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks encouraged his growth by taking him on a tour of Europe in 2013 as a non-playing apprentice. Savea got to tour with his older brother Julian, then play as an All Black with \u201cThe Bus\u201d for 18 months before Julian was axed after five years, 54 tests, and 46 tries.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing \u201cMinibus\u201d about Ardie, who will turn 26 this month and is far from the finished product to the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special athlete and he has the ability to influence the game with and without the ball,\u201d Foster says. \u201cOften you see a player who\u2019s great in one of those aspects, but he can influential in both in big moments.\n\n\u201cHis attack stuff is good, and it can be a lot better. Sometimes he puts so much effort into his ball carrying that he can switch out of the game for a little bit after that. So we\u2019re going to keep challenging him, which he probably doesn\u2019t like hearing. Everyone\u2019s got a role. The only way he can he do what he does is if people around him do what they do.\u201d\n\nColes, for one, is glad he\u2019s on the same side as Savea for the All Blacks and Hurricanes.\n\n\u201cFrom a little boy from Rongotai to, like, probably one of the best players in the world. He\u2019s in a really good place,\u201d Coles says of his teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s a special kid. He\u2019s just got a good heart, he\u2019s a good person and when he\u2019s on the field, he\u2019s just doing everything he can to show what it means to be an All Black.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The All Blacks lost ground and Ardie Savea turned around, sprinted back to the ruck, shrugged off a South African trying to clean him out, and snaffled the ball for a turnover.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
