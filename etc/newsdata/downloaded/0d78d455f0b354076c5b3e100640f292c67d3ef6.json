Dislocating his shoulder against the All Blacks in November 2017 was the worst of the lot.\n\n'The most frustrating thing about my shoulder was that they said it was meant to be a four-month return,' recalls Ball.\n\n'Then there was a bit of a complication because I had some nerve damage from the operation that set me back and it was hard for me, the fact that was on top of it.\n\n'There was a point where it just wasn't getting any stronger. I had a hole in my back where the muscle had just stopped working because of the nerves that they disrupted.\n\n'At one point, I wasn't sure that was going to get any better.\n\n'I was seeing the nerve specialist and he was saying \"look, this is probably going to take between six and 10 months.\"\n\nBall has started the first World Cup games with Alun Wyn Jones and is inspired by the skipper\n\n'I remember thinking \"Christ, I can't see it taking that long.\" He was about right.\n\n'To go for the best part of five years without an injury, which is probably what I had and I was very durable, playing 80 minutes a game, to then having that patch was very frustrating from a mental side.'\n\nBall started to plan for a life after rugby - learning how to trade in foreign exchange - as the light at the end of the tunnel dimmed.\n\nIt took a complete break from the game to set him back on a path to the Test arena.\n\n'The changing point for me was the La Rochelle game in the European Cup for the Scarlets in 2018,' Ball said.\n\n'I was hoping to be back for that and it didn't happen. The coaches said \"we want you to have a bit of down time\" and it was my sister's wedding back in Perth so they said \"we want you to go\". They knew how frustrated I was.\n\n'I had a week off, didn't train and when I came back my strength increased and for whatever reason I seemed to carry on from there.'\n\nWith Cory Hill injured, and having to fly home, Adam Beard dramatically losing his appendix and Bradley Davies not yet up to speed Ball has started the first two World Cup games with captain Alun Wyn Jones.\n\nWarren Gatland is a great man-manager and gives his players confidence, according to Ball\n\nAnd Ball has been inspired by his skipper.\n\n'Alun Wyn seems to be the constant!' he added.\n\n'Over the years everyone has revolved around him. It's a big challenge for me - Alun Wyn is obviously a talisman - to push him and outdo some of his stats.\n\n'Not that I did that against Australia! For me that's a goal - to work harder than him.'\n\nAnd Ball owes it to Warren Gatland that he is back fit, firing and full of beans at this Japanese World Cup.\n\n'Warren is very honest,' said Ball.\n\n'He tells you exactly what he wants you work on. He can give you a lot of confidence, is a great man-manager and I have a massive amount of respect for the man.\n\nAnd Ball is targeting a top spot finish for Wales in Pool D ahead of their clash against Fiji\n\n'When he says something you really listen.'\n\nWith Fiji on Wednesday Ball is ready to go again.\n\n'There's a lot of self-belief, a lot of quality in the squad and it's an exciting place to be,' he said.\n\n'We just have to target these next two games and make sure we finish top of our Pool.'", "description": "Jake Ball has gone from injury-prone to irreplaceable in the Wales team - two years ago he could not lift an arm, but in a month might lift the World Cup.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19342968-0-image-a-45_1570309431313.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
