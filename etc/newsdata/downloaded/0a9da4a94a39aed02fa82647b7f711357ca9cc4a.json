(Ramon Espinosa/AP)\n\nShella Moneistime paced outside a packed government shelter for hurricane victims.\n\nHer 3-week-old son wore a clean diaper as he napped inside. She had a cot and three meals a day. But she was distressed.\n\n\u201cWe get food. We get water. We sleep,\u201d Moneistime, 31, said, her voice cracking. \u201cThe point is: How long we going to be in there?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two weeks since Hurricane Dorian leveled Moneistime\u2019s home on Great Abaco Island and no one here can answer that yet.\n\nThe most urgent crisis left by the Category 5 hurricane, which battered the northwestern Bahamas for 40 hours and killed at least 50 people, is over. Nearly everyone has been evacuated from Great Abaco, where most structures were obliterated. Many also left Grand Bahama, where flooding and wind damage was widespread.\n\nAid efforts on those islands were underway even as a tropical storm brushed the Bahamas on Saturday. Humberto was expected to bring up to four inches of rain and winds of about 40 mph as it moved past Great Abaco island.\n\n[Tropical Storm Humberto brings more rain to battered Bahamas]\n\nBut the large-scale displacement has created a new challenge. The government says New Providence, home to the bustling city of Nassau, has received at least 5,500 evacuees, probably far more. More than 2,000 are in government shelters, most of which are full. Others are crammed into the homes of friends or family. The arrivals represent a small rise in a city of 275,000, but their presence is putting new strains on the system and raising questions about housing, employment, schooling and integration of evacuees, many of whom are Haitian and lack legal status.\n\n\u201cNew Providence is 21 miles long and seven miles wide, and it holds 80 percent of the population,\u201d said Christopher Curry, a historian at the University of the Bahamas. \u201cThe challenge is you have people being evacuated from these communities to a saturated island.\u201d\n\nOfficials may try to \u2018entice\u2019 evacuees to relocate to other islands\n\nTo address part of the newcomers\u2019 needs, the government on Thursday began registering evacuated children for public school. Some 10,000 children were enrolled on the two affected islands, and officials estimate that about 5,000 of them may seek to register in New Providence, said Zane Lightbourne, an education ministry administrator overseeing the process with assistance from UNICEF.\n\nAs he spoke, displaced parents and children sat behind him on chairs arranged outside a large stadium, waiting to be called inside for registration. Across a parking lot, a gardener zipped around on an orange ride-on mower, trimming lush grass beneath palm trees.\n\nInside, health workers checked immunization records \u2014 those that survived the hurricane \u2014 and administered required shots. Parents sat at tables, filling out forms. Children wore new backpacks, tags still dangling, that held composition notebooks and pencil pouches. If all went smoothly, families emerged with a letter that would allow the kids to attend a specific school.\n\n[Haitians in the Bahamas seek more protection after Hurricane Dorian aid groups, news cameras leave]\n\nBut many public schools here are overcrowded already \u2014 some with classes of nearly 40 students, according to the teachers union. Lightbourne said officials will assign them to the least-packed campuses, which might not be close to where the children are staying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to avoid chaotic situations. We\u2019re trying to avoid burning out teachers,\u201d Lightbourne said. \u201cNot just to be a body in an environment, but to be a body in a room with furniture and learning, that\u2019s the ultimate goal here.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials have said they are exploring housing options that are more permanent than shelters. But Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has said Nassau cannot accommodate all the displaced, and Lightbourne said education officials might try to \u201centice\u201d some evacuees to move to another of the 30 inhabited islands in this archipelago nation.\n\nThat might be for the best, said Belinda Wilson, president of the Bahamas Union of Teachers.\n\n\u201cIn those islands, the class sizes are very small,\u201d she said. \u201cThis natural disaster that we face is going to call for leadership and for extraordinary thinking.\u201d\n\nLanding jobs will be tough because of high unemployment\n\nSheneka Thompson\u2019s and Lavonne Stubbs\u2019s minds were already there. Their townhouse in the Murphy Town area of Great Abaco was ruined, their jobs in tourism now nonexistent. After stepping off the evacuation boat that deposited them in Nassau\u2019s port, they were lucky enough to meet a Good Samaritan who put them up in a hotel for several days.\n\nBut this night would be their last, and now their sights were set on Eleuthera, an island famous for pink sand beaches. Stubbs, 30, grew up there. He had a lead on a place to stay. There might be tourism work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough jobs for everybody here,\u201d said Thompson, 34, who was outside the shelter trying to reach a friend inside.\n\nShe\u2019s right, Curry said: Unemployment in New Providence was already above 10 percent, and youth unemployment was around 20 percent. \u201cA lot of people are living below the poverty line, basically just surviving from meal to meal and with the assistance of social services,\u201d he said.\n\n[When Hurricane Dorian blew through the Bahamas, it exposed one of the world\u2019s great faultlines of inequality]\n\nNicola McIntosh tried to get a job. Just a few days after evacuating from Grand Cay, off Great Abaco, she spotted an ad for an office assistant in the Tribune, a local paper. She gathered her documents and went to apply. But the employer wanted a police record and references \u2014 things she didn\u2019t have yet.\n\nMcIntosh and her three children stayed one night in a Nassau shelter, but it was \u201cso horrible,\u201d she said. Now they were staying with her brother in his studio apartment \u2014 they on the bed, he on the floor. It wasn\u2019t sustainable, but renting would require income.\n\n\u201cI need to get a job, get on my feet, get an apartment,\u201d she said, waiting at the stadium to register her children for school. \u201cBut we just started from scratch.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials have emphasized that accommodating the displaced is a priority, but also a slow and evolving process. Registering schoolchildren is expected to take about an hour per student, and a month total.\n\nFrustrations and fears mount as progress is stalled for many\n\nShakira Lightbourne exited the stadium holding the hand of her 3-year-old and glowering. The mother of six boys, whose souvenir shop in the Grand Bahama city of Freeport was flooded, was already tense from temporarily residing in a small house with five other relatives.\n\nEven though she hoped to return home in a few weeks, she wanted stability for her children. So she borrowed a car and waited three hours to enroll them in school. Instead, officials told her they were prioritizing kids in shelters, she said, and she needed to bring all six to the stadium. She\u2019d brought three.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know when they can process me. They say they\u2019ll call me,\u201d said Lightbourne, who is not related to the education ministry official. \u201cI said, how long? They don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA few feet away, Veronne McKenzie sat on brick steps, waiting her turn. She had an option if Nassau didn\u2019t work out: A U.S. visa. She\u2019d long used it to travel to Miami, buy clothing, and then sell it in the now-destroyed Great Abaco town of Marsh Harbour. America might be better than here, she said.\n\nThere was a problem, though, one shared by other evacuee families. Her three children didn\u2019t have visas. \u201cI can\u2019t leave them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe friend they were staying with had kicked them out that morning, McKenzie said. From her pocket, McKenzie, 55, pulled a crumpled scrap of paper that someone inside the stadium had given her. It listed the names of two shelters. Maybe she\u2019d try them.\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll sleep in the car,\u201d she said softly.\n\nDid she have a car?\n\nShe waved her hand.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nCrews keep finding bodies.
