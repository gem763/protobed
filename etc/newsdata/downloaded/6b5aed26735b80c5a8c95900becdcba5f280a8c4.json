Samsung\n\nAfter months of delays, Samsung\u2019s ambitious Galaxy Fold is finally ready for sale \u2013 making it the world\u2019s first brand to sell phones with a foldable touchscreen.\n\nThe device will be launched on Friday (Sept 6) in Korea, followed by selected countries including Singapore, the US, UK, France and Germany, the brand announced on Thursday (Sept 5).\n\nThe phone will be available in Singapore on Sept 18 (for the Cosmos Black colour) and Sept 21 (for the Space Silver colour) at Samsung stores or local telcos.\n\nIt costs S$3,088, and comes with 12GB RAM and 512GB of storage space.\n\nSamsung has teased the Galaxy Fold since April, but was forced to delay its launch after a disastrous and very public series of tests that saw the device severely malfunction after being unboxed by tech reviewers.\n\nThe company said it had since improved the phone\u2019s design and construction, and created an \u201centirely new UX (user experience)\u201d to make use of its ability to fold.\n\nWhen closed, the users can still access \u201cessential\u201d features, such as the camera, on the phone\u2019s 4.6-inch cover screen, or have apps open in multiple windows on the fully-opened 7.3-inch screen.\n\nVideos opened on the main screen will automatically switch to the cover screen when the phone is shut.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold has six camera lenses: three on the back (wide-angle, ultra wide-angle and telephoto), two on the front (selfie and depth), and one on the cover screen (selfie).\n\nIt has no earphone jack \u2013 instead, the device will come bundled with a set of wireless Galaxy Buds.\n\nIt supports fast charging, but has no reverse charging capability.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It has 6 camera lenses and no earphone jack..
