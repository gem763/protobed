Children the country over are benefiting from tablets, computers, smartboards, Google Classroom and more.\n\nWhat you haven\u2019t yet heard are the reasons why technology can simplify a parent's life when talking administrative tasks related to their child's schooling.\n\nSo for starters, let\u2019s pull ourselves out of the 19th century!\n\n\n\nNow more than ever we're aware of the impact our paper usage is having on the environment. It\u2019s long overdue to bid a fine farewell to paper permission slips and indemnity forms.\n\nSay hello to checklists that update automatically when forms are digitally signed off by the parent. Something as simple as a Google Sheets can be used for this purpose.\n\nYour child's teacher will thank you for dramatically reducing the need for her to chase and follow up when the dog accidentally stole the outing return slip.\n\nWhatsApp is also a handy communication tool.\n\nMake your child\u2019s school a cash-free zone\n\nConsider the safety of your child in the school environment and insist on a cash free zone. Using technology to remove the need to transact in cash on the school premises should be a priority in every school.\n\nApps like Karri gives parents the ability to process school fees via an app \u2013 as well as all the little annoying payments that pop-up. Bonus, you\u2019ll earn e-points (Greenbacks, Ebucks, Ucount, etc.) when making the payment using a pre-loaded credit card.\n\nThe TAPTUCK app works similarly, allowing users to pre-order tuck shop items for their child by loading cash onto a 'TAPTUCK wallet'. Find more information about the TAPTUCK app and other school admin apps here.\n\nTech driven school transport\n\nFind reliable and safe transport for your child with the LocTransie app.\n\nThe service puts parents in touch with the transport system at a specific school and also features a real-time tracking service.\n\nDrivers also keep parents informed regarding delays and route diversions. Read more about the LocTransie app and other travel services here.\n\nIt\u2019s time to progress to the age of technology-enabled parenting.\n\nCompiled for Parent24 by Lesley-Anne Johannes.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
