The company does not provide figures by region for its equities business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacquarie plans to focus on its Asia Pacific equities trading business, the sources said, which will likely be its only major equities operation remaining after it scaled back from the Middle East in May.\n\nA broader slowdown in equities trading has prompted banks to cut costs. In July, Deutsche Bank's massive cull of 18,000 jobs in a \u20ac7.4 billion ($11.8 billion) shake-up included staff reductions from Sydney to New York.\n\nAt least four trading sources at other brokerages said their contacts at Macquarie's equities research and trading businesses could not be reached on their usual messaging systems on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Lots of staff are milling around the local coffee shops ... opposite their building [in the City of London] waiting to be allowed in,\" one of the sources said.\n\nBloomberg was first to report the Macquarie job cuts on Tuesday.\n\nThe bank, which is due to report its half-year earnings on Friday, had said in March that it faced \"challenging market conditions and reduced opportunities\" in its cash equities and equity derivatives trading business.\n\nAnother source at a hiring firm noted the latest move was a U-turn for Macquarie, saying it was hiring as little as a few months back.\n\nReuters", "description": "The bank, which is seen cutting 100 jobs in London and New York, said the restructuring is part of a plan to focus on the Asia-Pacific region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/69309bb8b5505ccef62ab2e6370d4a2840906ff5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
