They said their coach never gives up on them and therefore they aren't giving up on him.\n\nThe players recorded the emotional moment they showed Kris Sweet, the team offensive coordinator, their new look. Sweet was sitting in his office on Monday as the players walked in one by one with bald heads.\n\n\"This all for you coach,\" one player is heard saying.\n\nSweet stands up embracing each of them. The video has since gone viral of on Twitter.\n\nRecently our Offensive Coordinator, Kris Sweet, was diagnosed with cancer. So members from the team shaved their heads to support him.
