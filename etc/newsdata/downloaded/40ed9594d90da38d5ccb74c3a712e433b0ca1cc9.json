An animated Murray let out several high-decibel roars and chuntered aggressively to himself and in the direction of his team throughout, while Londero was resigned to slapping himself around the face in fury at his failure to break down the three-time Grand Slam champion.\n\nLondero was beaten (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nOn a three-match losing streak heading into Shanghai, Londero seemingly found his groove coming through qualifying and adapted far quicker to the conditions than the British No. 6, in what was his first appearance at this Masters 1000 event since he won a third title there in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor much of the first set Londero struck a clean ball \u2013 hitting 18 winners in total \u2013 but Murray was largely the architect of his own downfall, with his forehand misfiring.\n\nBut as Londero\u2019s level dipped, Murray\u2019s rose. He tidied up his game in the second set \u2013 creating multiple break point chances in each return game \u2013 and soon levelled.\n\nThe third and final set was by far the most competitive \u2013 with both finally simultaneously operating at a high level \u2013 but a pumped up Murray was ultimately the victor.\n\nMurray was put under pressure early on by his Argentine opponent and was forced to save two break points in a 14-minute opening game with aces \u2013 first down the T and then out wide \u2013 while a third saw Londero fire narrowly wide before Murray held.\n\nThree break point chances came and went for Murray \u2013 whose forehand was spluttering errors \u2013 in the fourth game of the match and they came back to bite him in the fifth, with his opponent breaking after 35 minutes.\n\nAndy Murray struggled early on (Picture: Getty)\n\nHis erratic forehand cost him dearly at 40-0 up in the seventh game. With the court at his mercy, Murray sent the ball long before serving two double faults on his way to falling a double break and 5-2 behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith his 18th winner of the set, Londero wrapped up a thoroughly deserved 1-0 lead with 49 minutes on the clock.\n\nMurray responded well early in the second, winning four points in a row from 40-15 down to break before holding for a 3-0 lead just beyond the hour mark.\n\nLondero recovered from 15-40 down in his next two service games to hold but ultimately couldn\u2019t keep a resurrgent Murray down, with the Briton securing the set with a double break.\n\nA sliced backhand dumped into the net saw Londero broken to love to fall 3-1 down in the decider but he hit back with a crisp forehand return winner in the next game, much to the frustration of an expletive-spitting Murray.\n\nAt the change of ends, he repeatedly aimed repetitive questions of \u2018yes or no?\u2019 \u2013 yes or no to what is not exactly clear \u2013 with a sarcastic look on his face in the direction of his team but a stunning forehand winner on the run left him roaring with joy as he broke once more for a 4-2 lead.\n\nAfter his opponent slapped himeslf around the face repeatedly at the next change of ends, Murray was soon over the line and joined compatriot Cam Norrie in the second round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth have outside chances of replacing Kyle Edmund as British No. 1 this week.
