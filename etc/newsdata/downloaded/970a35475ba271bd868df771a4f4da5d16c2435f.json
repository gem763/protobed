REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) raised its estimate for 2019 earnings on Tuesday as quarterly profit climbed 9.2% amid improved sales of its F-35 fighter jets, but shares fell in premarket trading after it forecast lower cash flow next year.\n\nThe company estimated 2020 cash flow of $7.2 billion, lower than its 2019 year-end estimate of $7.6 billion, which disappointed investors and sent the stock down about 2.8% in premarket trading.\n\nStill, Lockheed raised its profit estimate for 2019 by 1.9% to $21.55 per share from $21.15, the high point of a previous guidance, amid an improved performance in its aeronautics business.\n\nThe Bethesda, Maryland-based company said 2020 sales would increase 5% to $62 billion from the current year-end 2019 estimate of $59.1 billion. Profit margins in 2020 were estimated to be between a range of 10.5% and 10.8%.\n\nNet income rose to $1.61 billion, or $5.66 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 29, from $1.47 billion, or $5.14 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales rose to $15.17 billion from $14.32 billion.\n\nLockheed delivered 28 F-35 combat jets in the quarter, compared with 20 a year earlier.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Lockheed delivered 29 F-35s. So far this year, the company has delivered 83 of the jets, out of a total expected for the year of 131.", "description": "Lockheed Martin Corp raised its estimate for 2019 earnings on Tuesday as quarterly profit climbed 9.2% amid improved sales of its F-35 fighter jets, but shares fell in premarket trading after it forecast lower cash flow next year.", "authors": ["Mike Stone", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443721081&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0ZI", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
