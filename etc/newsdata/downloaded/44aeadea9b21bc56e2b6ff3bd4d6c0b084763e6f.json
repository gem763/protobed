He highlighted the government\u2019s proposal for an expansionary budget next year, while maintaining fiscal health. Korea\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be at 39.8 percent next year, far lower than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average at over 100 percent.China\u2019s latest economic data, released Friday, places further uncertainty on Hong\u2019s target.The country\u2019s economy grew by only 6 percent in the third quarter, a 27-year low. Korea\u2019s economy will likely be impacted by its neighbor\u2019s slowdown, considering their deep-running trade ties. China is Korea\u2019s largest trading partner.In the face of an economic slowdown, Korea has resorted to monetary and fiscal measures.The central bank lowered the interest rate to a historic low of 1.25 percent this week.The decision has, however, had limited impact on the bond market.According to the Korea Financial Investment Association, three-year bond yields rose for two consecutive days since the rate cut, ending at 1.375 percent on Thursday.President Moon Jae-in called for more expansionary spending on Thursday, including in construction projects, which the current administration had previously distanced itself from, underscoring an urgency to vitalize the economy.The government expects the economic slowdown to continue in the near future, according to the Finance Ministry\u2019s latest monthly report released Friday.\u201cThe Japanese government\u2019s export restrictions continue, and although there was a first stage agreement made on the U.S.-China trade conflict, uncertainties to future negotiations exist,\u201d read the report.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/18200731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
