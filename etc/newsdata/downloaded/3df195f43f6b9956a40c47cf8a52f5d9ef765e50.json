Earlier this week, the bloc agreed to limit arms exports to Turkey over its offensive, but stopped short of a bloc-wide embargo against their NATO ally.\n\n\"This is a deep, durable and multi-faceted crisis,\" said one senior EU diplomat, adding that there is serious concern among EU member states that the crisis will flush out foreign Islamic State militants who could come to Europe.\n\nTENSIONS OVER ENLARGEMENT\n\nDifferences over plans for the EU's first enlargement since 2013 will be exposed at the summit, with France determined that Albania and North Macedonia are not ready for membership talks.\n\nParis says challenges facing the EU - including Brexit, the emergence of China as a strategic rival and security threats posed by Russia - are already too extensive to admit two more states from a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\n\"It's a very difficult and political debate,\" said a second senior EU diplomat, describing it as an effort to find a balance between stabilizing the Balkans and risking the functioning of the bloc itself.\n\nAnother key issue will be the EU's budget for 2021-2027, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), with the biggest problem how to cover the shortfall when Britain leaves.\n\nMember states have yet to agree how much individual countries should contribute, a question made all the more difficult by proposals to end a system of rebates.\n\n\"It's not a discussion that will end in consensus, but the first time that they will enter into the numbers game,\" said a third senior EU diplomat. \"The positions are clear, but obviously there is division.\"\n\nThe summit will also be a chance for EU leaders to find common ground on climate targets ahead of a U.N. summit in Chile in December.\n\nThere is broad, though not unanimous, support for the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, but there are differences among members over how much progress should be made by 2030. In 2018, the majority of EU states agreed on a 40% reduction, a goal some have criticized as not ambitious enough.", "description": "Last-gasp Brexit deal set to dominate fraught EU summit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F21U-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
