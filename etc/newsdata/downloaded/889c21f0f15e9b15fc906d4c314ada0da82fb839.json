S, -3.34% claimed monthly subsidies for serving about 885,000 Lifeline subscribers, low-income earners who get subsidies to access phone and broadband service, even though none were using the service, the Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday. Chairman Ajit Pai called for an investigation of the matter on the grounds that it was a violation of a key rule, called the \"non-usage\" rule, that is designed to prevent waste, fraud and abuse of the program. \"It's outrageous that a company would claim millions of taxpayer dollars for doing nothing,\"Pai said in a statement. \"This shows a careless disregard for program rules and American taxpayers. I have asked our Enforcement Bureau to investigate this matter to determine the full extent of the problem and to propose an appropriate remedy.\" The 885,000 number is equal to almost 30% of Sprint's Lifeline subscriber base. The program helps make phone and Internet service more affordable for less well-off customers and companies are supposed to turn it off if they are not using the service. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said in a tweet that Sprint's planned merger with T-Mobile TMUS, -0.75% should be paused to allow for the investigation. Sprint shares fell 3.3% and are up 9.5% in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.84% has gained 18%.", "description": "Sprint Corp. claimed monthly subsidies for serving about 885,000 Lifeline subscribers, low-income earners who get subsidies to access phone and broadband...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
