Photo: Ken Howard/Met Opera\n\nThe longest-running, dumbest debate in musical categorization got an answer at the Met\u2019s season-opening night: Porgy and Bess is neither a musical nor an opera; it\u2019s two operas. One is a profound and moving portrait of neighborhood pummeled by deprivation, racism, and hurricanes. The other is a pageant of mortifying stereotypes: the flashy drug dealer, the promiscuous addict, the panhandler with a platinum soul, the army of Lord-praising church ladies waving their hands at the sky. What binds those irreconcilable differences into an abiding piece of theater is George Gershwin\u2019s music, which has more marvels per yard than much of the standard repertoire. And, in its first revival in a generation, the Met does the score proud.\n\nEven though Porgy\u2019s been gone from the house since 1990, the company treated it as utterly familiar territory. David Robertson has the Met\u2019s orchestra whipping up Verdian gales and caressing Puccini-esque arias. Bass-baritone Eric Owens lends hard-earned Wagnerian majesty to the title role. Alfred Walker, a veteran of 150 Met performances over two decades, draws on a deep well of operatic villains for his terrifying portrayal of Crown. And Latonia Moore, who has sung a scorching Aida at the Met, delivers Serena\u2019s aria, \u201cMy Man\u2019s Gone Now,\u201d with the kind of confidence that comes from playing a princess on the world\u2019s most intimidating stage.\n\nGershwin conceived Porgy and Bess in part as a stepping-stone for struggling black singers. He would have been gratified to see this production reap the benefits of so many rich careers. On opening night, the competition for the most raucous ovations was intense, and not limited to top-billed artists. Leah Hawkins, a member of the Met\u2019s young artist program, turned the Strawberry Woman\u2019s cry into a two-minute revelation.\n\nAll those musical superpowers on the Met\u2019s stage make Porgy as easy to love as it is hard to swallow. Director James Robinson makes no excuses for the written-out patois. ( \u201cThem\u2019s the same cock-eyed bones what clean the game out last Saturday night. If they rolls in this game, I rolls out.\u201d) He doesn\u2019t try to humanize the \u201cdrinkin\u2019, gamblin\u2019, swearin\u2019 \u201d \u2014 not to mention murdering, beating, and raping \u2014 Crown, or soften the scene in which Bess throws herself into her abuser\u2019s arms. This is not a Porgy for the Black Lives Matter or #MeToo eras. It\u2019s the same old troubled triumph, flaunting the same old faults and doing so magnificently. Catherine Zuber dresses the downtrodden in stylish misery and set designer Michael Yeargan turns Catfish Row into a rotating cluster of fishermen\u2019s stilt houses. Porgy takes Bess as she is, not as he would like her to be, and we must do the same for the work. Opera audiences will tolerate a lot of clich\u00e9s in exchange for some mighty singing.\n\nMusic is like a drug, and its narcotic powers have made it a struggle for the Met to drag itself into the present. Give it points for trying. True, the only depiction of African-American life that makes it to the opera stage with any regularity was written by three white guys, but the Met has the beginnings of an alternative: Just before launching the season, the company announced plans to stage Terence Blanchard\u2019s Fire Shut Up in My Bones, based on a memoir by the Times columnist Charles Blow.\n\nIn the meantime, this Porgy depends on a cast whose members not only sing superbly but sing to each other. As the curtain goes up, Clara soothes her newborn with \u201cSummertime,\u201d and Golda Schultz really does seem to be blessing the doll in her arms with all the pleasurable memories she can muster from a difficult life. Frederick Ballentine does more than strut and ooze as Sportin\u2019 Life; he understands Bess enough to manipulate her.\n\nAnd at the heart of the show are Owens and the soprano Angel Blue, who made the title characters\u2019 love utterly believable, never something to be taken for granted in opera. Owens sings with urgent reticence, letting his big voice roll through the lines like deep waves. Porgy has learned that, without the full command of his body, he must tame his emotions, and the tension between passion and control plays out in his voice. Instead of kneeling or pushing himself around on a wooden cart, Owens stands with his leg in a brace, using his crutch as support, weapon, and expressive tool. That simple decision to get Porgy off the floor allows Owens to deploy the full measure of his stage presence \u2014 and, incidentally, compensate for the moments when the part drifts a little high for comfort.\n\nBlue, too, finds a way to dose tenderness and vulnerability into an almost three-dimensional Bess. Whether she\u2019s sashaying into Catfish Row or flopping in a drugged stupor, she wears a bruised soul and sings with polished radiance. But it\u2019s the fusion of her and Owens\u2019s dark timbres and emotional currents that bears the opera\u2019s tragic load. When Porgy limps off to follow the runaway Bess to New York, we root for a reunion, mostly because we want to hear their voices intertwine once more.", "description": "Opera Review: Justin Davidson on the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s First Revival of George Gershwin\u2019s \u2018Porgy & Bess\u2019 Since 1990", "authors": ["Justin Davidson"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-porgy-and-bess.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
