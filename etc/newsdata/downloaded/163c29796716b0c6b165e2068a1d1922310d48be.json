He turns it into a marketing opportunity, of course.\n\nIn addition to $50 million in guaranteed money due in his contract extension, Elliott received a new T-shirt from Jones with the phrase \u201cZeke Who?\u201d emblazoned on the front.\n\nOn the back? \u201cThat\u2019s who!\u201d complete with an image of Elliott and the iconic Cowboys star.\n\nJerry presents jersey to Zeke! \u201cThat\u2019s pretty funny,\u201d said Zeke. \u201cI was thinking of doing one, too!\u201d pic.twitter.com/m8bKZCCoMp \u2014 KristiCowboySideline (@KristiCowboy) September 5, 2019\n\nAnother marketing win for Jerry Jones\n\nHere\u2019s guessing those shirts will soon be widely available at your favorite Cowboys merchandise outlet.\n\nLeave it to Jones to turn a source of tension into a marketing opportunity.

(AP)\n\nOrigins of \u2018Zeke who?\u2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shirt, of course, is a reference to the comment Jones made after a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams. When asked about the emergence of backup running back Tony Pollard in terms of contract negotiations with Elliott, Jones responded, \u201cZeke who?\u201d\n\nYes, Jerry Jones said \"Zeke who\", when asked if Tony Pollard is his \"best negotiator\".\n\n\n\nBut... this is the full \"Zeke who?\" sound bite from Jerry, complete with the necessary context of his follow-up to the joke, saying the #Cowboys need both Zeke Elliott and Tony Pollard. pic.twitter.com/yDiZnlwwke \u2014 Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) August 18, 2019\n\nJones\u2019 remark reportedly irked Elliott and prompted his agent Rocky Arceneaux to blast it as \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d\n\nThat was roughly three weeks ago.\n\nNo more talk of disrespect\n\nNow Elliott has his payday and is ready to go for Week 1 against the New York Giants. Which, in hindsight, appears to have been the plan all along. There\u2019s no talk of disrespect in Cowboys camp now.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so far behind us,\u201d Elliott said when asked about \u201cZeke who?\u201d after rejoining the Cowboys. \u201cWe signed a deal. So there\u2019s really no point in talking about that old stuff.\u201d\n\nJones, however, is clearly happy to talk about \u201cthat old stuff\u201d as long as there\u2019s a dollar to made and he does so with a smile on his face.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "It was all laughs and smiles between Ezekiel Elliott and Jerry Jones over \"Zeke who?\" on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kPhHkotWc20lYE6eXrwvZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTAuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z89yPynpT9C7PuLlELDP6A--~B/aD0zMDU5O3c9NDM5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a8fa4000-d029-11e9-bfe5-b6c74f38b2a5", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
