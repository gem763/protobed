She is one of more than 180 women who filed sexual assault complaints against the company.\n\nLilly, for her part, complained to the police, the state licensing board and the company. A year and a half later, she realized Massage Envy was still billing her every month for her spa membership. Frustrated and angry, she downloaded the company\u2019s app hoping that she could use it to cancel.\n\nThat\u2019s when things got even worse. When Lilly clicked to agree to the app\u2019s terms and conditions, she also agreed to take any complaints about the company to arbitration, a secret court where she would have no right to a jury trial and where the deck is often stacked against victims of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nLilly\u2019s case, though extreme, is not unusual. Hundreds of millions of Americans have unwittingly signed away their right to go to court against most of the biggest companies in the world through the practice that\u2019s known as forced arbitration. These agreements are tucked into online terms of service or buried in cellphone or credit card agreements. They\u2019re even slapped onto stickers placed on washing machines.\n\nThis Friday, the House is expected to vote on a bill, the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, that would ban forced arbitration. The FAIR Act would prohibit so-called pre-dispute arbitration agreements in all employment, civil rights, consumer and antitrust cases.\n\nIf the law passes, Americans could still choose to take a dispute to arbitration but no one would be forced to give up their right to go to court. The bill is expected to pass in the House, with wide Democratic support. At least one Republican, Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), also backs the Fair Act.\n\nThe vote Friday would mark the first time an arbitration bill has even made it out of committee. Though, it isn\u2019t expected to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nIn floor debates at the House on Wednesday, one Republican congresswoman, Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona, summarized the opposition, saying the bill would be a boon to trial lawyers \u2015 and flood the courts with class-action lawsuits. She contended arbitration is faster for victims and less costly. Lawyers and victims who\u2019ve gone through the process say those claims have little grounding in reality.\n\nStill, even though the bill might not become law, activists and arbitration opponents are celebrating a victory.\n\n\u201cThe fact this is coming to the house floor for a vote is a pretty monumental development,\u201d said Karla Gilbride, a senior attorney at Public Justice, who represents workers and consumers in cases against corporations that involved forced arbitration.\n\nForced arbitration has undergone renewed scrutiny in recent years because of the way companies use the practice to cover up sexual harassment cases.\n\nMen accused of sexual harassment, like former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, have used the secretive process to silence women.\n\nNancy Erika Smith, a lawyer who represented two women who sued O\u2019Reilly for defamation after the New York Times revealed he had secretly paid them money.\n\n\u201cThe N.Y. courts allowed O\u2019Reilly to force these women into secret arbitration. It\u2019s outrageous. Women are so tired of being silenced by secret corporate courts,\u201d she said.\n\nSmith also represented former Fox host Gretchen Carlson who has been advocating against forced arbitration ever since she filed a sexual harassment suit against her former boss at Fox, Roger Ailes in 2016.\n\nCarlson was able to get around an arbitration clause by suing Ailes directly but the litigation sparked years of activism. She\u2019s been advocating on the Hill for a different bill that would ban the practice in sexual harassment cases.\n\n\u201cWe basically have 25 years of sexual harassment history under wraps,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cThe way in which we resolve harassment cases is that we never hear from women ever again.\u201d\n\nIn the work world, about 60 million workers in the private sector are subject to forced arbitration agreements, meaning that they cannot sue their employer in open court.", "description": "She never dreamed that downloading an app would prevent her from seeking justice.", "authors": ["Emily Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4rREa4HKMU4NBZ7j7.myew--~B/aD0yNDQ4O3c9MjQ0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8385772300001c0557c1d4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
