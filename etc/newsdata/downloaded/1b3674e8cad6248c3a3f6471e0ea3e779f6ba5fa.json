AFR\n\nThe failure of the $1 billion float of Fahour's Latitude Financial Group occurred despite Latitude's owners being, in the end, willing to sell stock 11 per cent beneath the bottom of their $2.00 to $2.25 initial pricing band (and after its joint lead managers sent messages to would-be investors saying demand for the stock \"currently exceeds the expected offer size\").\n\nLess than a day later, Harvey Norman fell some $8 million short of a $174 million capital-raise, despite its being priced at an extraordinary $2.50 a share, a 46 per cent discount to the trading price.\n\nSeems Harvey Norman shareholders were sceptical of tipping in more cash to fund their own dividends. Meanwhile, others couldn't quite stomach the thought of buying up Latitude (and funding Fahour's $22.5 million pay day).\n\nStill, for sheer capital-raising chutzpah, we suppose Fahour and Harvey do make the best-matched of business partners.", "description": "Within 24 hours of each other, both had failed to convince investors to stump up the cash to invest in their respective businesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.542%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_56%2C$y_454/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a6d9dde86fcf3d429a651773e174653c95b790a8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
