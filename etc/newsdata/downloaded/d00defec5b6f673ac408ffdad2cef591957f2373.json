The department says Pankey remains a person of interest in the investigation.\n\nOn July 24, crews digging for a pipeline in a rural Weld County oil field uncovered a set of skeletal remains. The next day, Greeley police confirmed they belonged to Matthews, who had been the subject of a Weld County missing persons case, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.\n\nJonelle's sister, Jennifer Mogensen, declined to comment on the investigation Friday.\n\nPankey and his former wife lived about 2 miles away from the Matthews family in 1984, according to the Statesman. Pankey told the newspaper that investigators had asked to speak with him multiple times about Jonelle after her disappearance, but he refused to do so without an attorney.\n\nMike Peters holds a photo of Jonelle Mattews in his home in Greeley. More\n\nLast week, roughly a month after Pankey said he submitted DNA to police in the case, authorities searched his Twin Falls condo and car.\n\nPankey was a 2014 Constitution Party candidate for governor in Idaho. He ran for the seat as a Republican in the 2018 primary.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Collins Coloradoan: Cold case: Former Idaho candidate under investigation in girl\u2019s slaying", "description": "Steve Pankey, a former candidate for Idaho governor, recently revealed he is under investigation in the 1984 slaying of a Colorado girl.", "authors": ["Erin Udell", "Fort Collins Coloradoan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MzvMYoPSbhYj_GkTRdVnpA--~B/aD0zNzAyO3c9NTQ5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/2eec39d229f9a8af074975b8b8f7b0f2", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
