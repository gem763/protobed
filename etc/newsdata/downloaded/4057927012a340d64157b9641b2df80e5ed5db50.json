It was an intimate affair: about 50 people. Emma Barua, a 28-year-old makeup artist from Brighton, arrived in a long, red velvet dress, before changing into a short, red number for dancing. After cutting the cake \u2013 vegan buttercream \u2013 the crowd began heckling: \u201cSPEECH.\u201d Barua stepped forward nervously and gazed out at the faces of her loved ones. \u201cI looked around the room and said: \u2018I didn\u2019t know I had so many friends,\u2019\u201d Barua remembers. \u201cThen I started crying and my friends sang a song about me being great, so I laughed instead of crying.\u201d\n\nIf you had stumbled across the get-together, you would have been forgiven for thinking you had crashed a wedding party. But, looking closer, you would have noticed something amiss. First, the groom was nowhere to be seen. And that heart-shaped pi\u00f1ata? Black. The cupcakes \u2013 reading \u201cNewly unwed\u201d and \u201cJust divorced\u201d \u2013 would have given it away. Barua wasn\u2019t getting married. She was having a divorce party.\n\nMany cultures have rituals to mark the transition from married life to singledom. In Judaism, a divorce document called a get is presented from husband to wife, in the presence of rabbis and witnesses, to spiritually dissolve the union. Divorcing couples in Japan smash a wedding ring with a mallet. Members of the north African Beidane ethnic group hold divorce parties to welcome women back into the community and signal to potential suitors that they are available to remarry. In western cultures, however, divorce is typically met with hushed silence, whispered gossip or sympathetic looks. Divorce isn\u2019t commemorated \u2013 and certainly not celebrated. Until now.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I wanted to make the party about me and my support network\u2019 ... Emma Barua (centre) with two friends at her divorce party.

(Tips include buying a penis pi\u00f1ata for guests to whack, and tossing melons carved to look like your ex-partner\u2019s face.) Since then, a cottage industry has sprung up, serving the needs of parting divorcees. Need a \u201cDivorced AF\u201d tank top or \u201cAll the single ladies\u201d bunting? No problem.\n\n\u201cWe need to recognise divorce as OK and an often positive step,\u201d Gallagher says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed or been discarded.\u201d Gallager\u2019s Catholic grandparents were unhappily married, but never divorced; they viscerally hated each other in their final years. Most of her clients are female, although she has thrown parties for men, who favour weekend jaunts to casinos or ski lodges.\n\nIs there a cruel side to all this revelry? Gallagher insists that her intention is to help her clients move on in a healthy and respectful way: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with trashing the ex.\u201d Still, melon-chucking and penis-shaped pi\u00f1atas don\u2019t sound like classy ways to signal you are getting over it. And being on the receiving end of a divorce party can be hurtful.\n\nFor Leah, a student in her 40s from north London, the party her ex-husband threw after they divorced several years ago was calculated to inflict maximum pain. He had been emotionally and financially abusive during their marriage and, after Leah initiated divorce proceedings, he left invitations and a guestlist in her home for her to find. The divorce party was held at her local pub and her ex had invited all their mutual friends, whom he had turned against her. \u201cThe whole thing was designed to hurt me,\u201d Leah says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that because I\u2019m self-centred. There was no reason for him to come to my local pub and leave the invitation on my coffee table.\u201d\n\nIn a society that often regards divorce as a failure, divorce parties offer an opportunity to reclaim the narrative\n\nBarua\u2019s divorce party wasn\u2019t about getting back at her ex, however, but a way to thank the loved ones who had been by her side during the difficult breakup. \u201cMy friends had suggested making a pi\u00f1ata with my ex\u2019s face on it, but I didn\u2019t want to do that, because it wasn\u2019t about him. I wanted to make the party about me and my friends and my support network, and a celebration of my life moving forwards.\u201d\n\nAmmanda Major, a therapist at Relate, agrees that divorce parties can be helpful. \u201cIt shows you\u2019re ready to embrace the next stage of your life and talk openly about what happened ... [and] celebrate the fact that you took action to end something that wasn\u2019t working for you,\u201d she says.\n\nDivorce parties can also commemorate the end of a protracted, and expensive, legal process. \u201cIt was an extreme relief,\u201d says Caleb, whose marriage broke down after he came out as trans. \u201cThere was a lot of going down to the courthouse. I was never sure if I was doing the papers right.\u201d Catherine Navarro, 35, an area manager from New Jersey, also didn\u2019t realise how difficult it was to obtain a divorce until she tried to begin proceedings. Despite separating from her ex-husband in 2012, Navarro wasn\u2019t able to locate him to serve him with divorce papers. After running a missing persons ad in her local newspaper, Navarro was finally granted a divorce in his absence in May 2019. Walking out of the courthouse, she felt like a teenager again. \u201cI was so happy. I\u2019d never cried tears of happiness like that before.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It was about celebrating a new chapter of my life\u2019 ...

As our lives are increasingly lived through the glowing squares of social media, public announcements about life landmarks are de rigueur. We track the births of children in real time, downloading new life one pixel at a time through the modern umbilical cord that is the smartphone. Pre-scripted proposals are shared online in excruciating detail. Weddings are elaborate and dizzyingly expensive. (The average cost of a wedding topped \u00a330,000 in 2018, an all-time high.) Even separations are now announced via public statement. Why not add divorce parties to the mix?\n\n\u201cWe have to have parties for everything now,\u201d says Leah, who doesn\u2019t understand the trend. But divorce parties can be a way to salvage some dignity from the messy wreckage of divorce. Gallagher tells me about the $25,000 (\u00a320,000) party she threw for a client in her 50s, whose husband left her for a younger woman. \u201cIt was an opportunity for her to acknowledge this horribly humiliating event and get ahold of it and say: \u2018I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m moving on and holding my head up high.\u2019\u201d In a society that often regards divorce as a failure, divorce parties offer the newly single the opportunity to reclaim their narratives. \u201cWhen we divorced, people kept saying: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019\u201d Barua says. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t sorry. I was in an unhappy marriage.\u201d\n\nDone right, divorce parties can be a celebration of new beginnings, full of joy and hope. \u201cIt was about celebrating a new chapter of my life,\u201d says Navarro. Featuring a \u201cHappily divorced\u201d sign and a sheet cake reading \u201cStraight out of marriage\u201d, her divorce party, held in April, was an uplifting affair, set to a soundtrack of 90s hip-hop. \u201cIt was one of the best nights of my life. I had so much fun.\u201d Caleb\u2019s divorce marked the beginning of a new, more authentic life. \u201cMy marriage was the last thing that tethered me to the period before I came out as trans,\u201d he says. \u201cMy ex was one of the only people who deadnamed me ... walking out of the courthouse felt like leaving my past behind.\u201d\n\nAfter Barua\u2019s divorce party ended, they all piled down to Brighton beach. Sitting on the stones, she felt free. \u201cThe divorce party was about celebrating that I\u2019d moved on and learned from my mistakes. There was no regret about what happened.\u201d Still, Barua probably wouldn\u2019t remarry. \u201cDivorce is a long process! I wouldn\u2019t want to go through that again.\u201d\n\nSome names have been changed", "description": "Is celebrating the end of a marriage a cruel way to get back at an ex \u2013 or a way to salvage dignity and move on?", "authors": ["Sirin Kale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5328490d21574fb35eec4ae8bcc3f5e2059466fb/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8dd4a21f3f908a5eb50ff8c9b6ec6c32", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
