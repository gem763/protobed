That puts the greater focus on clues about how much further the Fed will go.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed gives forward guidance that suggests less than what the market is thinking, then you will probably see markets sell off,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. \u201cSo long as the Fed plays along with what markets are pricing in...I think markets will be very stable.\u201d\n\nThe Fed's 180-degree pivot from tightening monetary policy last year to easing it has helped drive the stock market's overall strong performance in 2019. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX has climbed 20% this year and is near all-time highs.\n\nThe central bank in July cited signs of a global slowdown, simmering U.S.-China trade tensions and a desire to boost too-low inflation as it lowered borrowing costs.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a near 90% probability that the Fed will shave another quarter point from its current overnight lending rate of 2.00% to 2.25%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool. There is a roughly 65% probability that the Fed makes at least one more quarter-point cut by the end of the year, according to FedWatch.\n\n\u201cThe market is going to want to see a focus that we have a cut and there is likely more coming,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. \u201cThey want to know that the Fed is vigilant and will act aggressively if needed.\u201d\n\nThat raises the importance of the newest set of policymakers\u2019 rate-path projections - the so-called dot plot - that will be released along with the rate decision. UBS economists said in a note they expect that will shift lower overall for 2019, but project only two cuts total for the year, which could irk both investors and a U.S. president eager for a more aggressive posture.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has frequently criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more swiftly and significantly, with the Fed chair he appointed, Jerome Powell, the primary target of his ire.\n\nThe European Central Bank\u2019s decision on Thursday to cut interest rates and restart a larger stimulus program could further pressure the Fed to cut rates, as the ECB\u2019s move stands to weaken the euro against the dollar and thereby drive up the price of U.S. exports - an issue that especially vexes Trump.\n\nPowell, who will give a news conference after the central bank issues its statement, has made comments in the past that have shaken the market, including in July, when he said the bank\u2019s rate cut might not be the start of a lengthy easing campaign to shore up the economy.\n\n\u201cEvery meeting has the ability for Jay Powell to say something that upsets markets a little bit,\u201d said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.\n\nPowell \u201chas had enough practice to know that he does not want to move markets or make news,\u201d he added.\n\nOf the past eight easing cycles since 1981, four have been \u201cinsurance\u201d cycles, when economic problems loom but the economy is not in a recession, while four were pre-recession cycles, according to research from Allianz Global Investors.\n\nOne year into an easing cycle, the S&P 500 rose an average of 20.4% during insurance cycles, while the index fell an average of 10.2% during pre-recession cycles, according to Allianz.\n\n\u201cHistorically, what they\u2019re doing now, which is cutting rates in an economy that is not in a recession and not really in any imminent risk of a recession, has been positive for the stock market,\u201d said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz.\n\nThe stock market overall has typically responded well to a second rate cut, which Wednesday's would be, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rising an average of 20.3% one year later, according to Ned Davis Research. The weakest performance has come when the Fed tried and failed to prevent a recession.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe probability of a recession in the next 12 months is nearly 38%, its highest in about a decade, according to the New York Fed\u2019s recession indicator, which is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Last month, yields on two-year U.S. bonds exceeded those on 10-year notes, an inversion of the yield curve that is seen as an omen of recession.\n\nAn escalation in the U.S.-China tariff war is contributing to economic uncertainty and is top among concerns for stock investors. Late last month, a key speech from Powell was upstaged when Trump issued tweets that heightened trade tensions.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s important that the Fed helps ease financial conditions and helps reduce the probability of recession,\u201d SunTrust\u2019s Lerner said. \u201cIf the tariff fight ratchets up more, then what the Fed does, the effect will be less.\u201d", "description": "With U.S.-China trade tensions roiling markets, investors are counting on support for stocks coming from a Federal Reserve willing to keep cutting interest rates to help the U.S. economy avoid a severe downturn.", "authors": ["Lewis Krauskopf", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429595959&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0YD", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
