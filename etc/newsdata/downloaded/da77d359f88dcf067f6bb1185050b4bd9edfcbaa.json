A dangerously polarized and often viciously partisan country would grow more so, with people on opposing sides hunkering down deeper in their camps and clinging harder to their chosen narratives as the president \u2014 concerned only with himself \u2014 ratcheted up his insistence that truth itself was subjective and up for grabs.\n\nThat\u2019s not a reason to blink, but it\u2019s a reality to brace for. At a juncture when we so desperately need to rediscover common ground, we\u2019d be widening the fault lines. Bringing the country together afterward would call for more than a talented politician; it would demand a miracle worker. None of the Democratic presidential candidates qualify.\n\nImpeachment should terrify you because it would mean a continued, relentless, overwhelming focus on Trump\u2019s lawlessness, antics, fictions and inane tweets. He would win in the short term \u2014 and all Americans would lose \u2014 because as long as most of the oxygen in Washington is consumed by the ghastly carnival of this barker, there\u2019s too little left for the nation\u2019s very real problems and for scrutiny of his substantive inadequacy in addressing them.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Bruni", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Impeachment-.Html"], "top_image": ""}
