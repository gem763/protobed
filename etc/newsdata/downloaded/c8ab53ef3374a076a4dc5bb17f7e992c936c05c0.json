On Tuesday, Fairfax County\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved the purchase of cameras for widespread use in the county police department. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nFairfax County on Tuesday moved to purchase 1,210 body cameras for its police force, putting into place the last big piece of a series of changes prompted by the 2013 fatal police shooting of an unarmed man outside his home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about accountability,\u201d said Supervisor John C. Cook (R-Braddock), who introduced a motion to spend $11 million over the next three years to buy the body cameras, train officers and hire 34 people to handle the new equipment.\n\nThe motion was unanimously approved by the Board of Supervisors, ensuring that Fairfax will join the District, Montgomery County and other major local jurisdictions whose officers commonly wear cameras to increase transparency and accountability as they work.\n\nAs chair of the board\u2019s public safety committee, Cook oversaw Fairfax\u2019s response to public outrage over the death of John B. Geer, who was shot at his doorstep in Springfield by a county police officer responding to a call about a domestic dispute.\n\nAdam D. Torres, who was eventually fired from the force, pleaded guilty in 2016 to involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThe shooting exposed a sense of distrust that some residents in Fairfax have toward county police, which spread to the county leadership after revelations that county attorneys counseled the police department to withhold Torres\u2019s internal affairs files from the office of the commonwealth\u2019s attorney investigating the shooting.\n\n\n\nJohn B. Geer was fatally shot by a Fairfax County police officer on Aug. 29, 2013, on his doorstep in Springfield. Geer was unarmed. (Jeff Stewart)\n\n[John Geer had hands up when shot by police, four officers say in documents]\n\nIn hopes of soothing tensions, Board of Supervisors Chairman Sharon Bulova (D-At Large) appointed an advisory task force to recommend ways to improve law enforcement in Virginia\u2019s largest jurisdiction.\n\nThe group made about 200 recommendations \u2014 estimated to cost $34 million if all are implemented \u2014 leading to the creation in 2016 of a nine-member civilian review board tasked with scrutinizing police department investigations into allegations of abuse or misconduct. That same year, the county board also approved the hiring of an independent auditor whose job is to monitor use-of-force investigations.\n\nBefore approving a pilot program for body cameras in some precincts in 2017, some county supervisors were worried about the possibility of violating the privacy of innocent bystanders if the footage was publicly released.\n\nThe police department allayed those concerns by putting in place procedures that mandate informing people they are being recorded, turning off the camera if asked to do so in places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and prohibiting recording private conversations.\n\nAdditionally, the extra people hired with the funds approved Tuesday will include personnel to screen footage for possible privacy concerns before it is released, county officials said.\n\nOn Tuesday, some supervisors were mainly worried about the costs of implementing the program as Fairfax continues to work its way out of an economic slump that made it harder to fund the police department and other services.\n\n\u201cThis program is going to set our public safety budget back millions of dollars and we should consider whether it should be prioritized over other pressing public safety concerns,\u201d said Supervisor Pat Herrity (R-Springfield), who nonetheless supported the measure.\n\nSeveral supervisors said their concerns were outweighed by the benefit of increased transparency in how Fairfax police officers do their work. They added that the body cameras also help the police officers against false accusations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cSo often, an incident is captured by someone using an iPhone or using some kind of video equipment,\u201d Bulova said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more critical that we have our own internal evidence about what happened.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Use of cameras throughout the department completes reforms proposed after Greer shooting.", "authors": ["Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qCf2_s2PJOonK_AotSuZaJo0MSY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TCOC6RGF4EI6LOJTGHETAIJZFI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
