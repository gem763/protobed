When the announcement was made early Thursday morning, jumped more than 170 pips in a matter of minutes. However it sold off just as quickly as investors turned their focus to the odds of Parliamentary approval. Nearly all of the initial gains were lost by the start of the N.Y. session but as the day progressed, traders dipped their toes back into the currency. We think that the gains in sterling are sustainable because even though Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces an uphill battle to collect all of the votes needed from lawmakers to seal the deal, members of Parliament won\u2019t want to risk another 3 years of policy gridlock or worse \u2013 an unruly no-deal Brexit. It's worth noting that Johnson hasn\u2019t won one Parliamentary vote, he\u2019s lost his majority and faces stiff resistance from the DUP. However this is the closest we\u2019ve been to an orderly exit in years and probably the best deal they\u2019ll get from the EU.\n\nThe new Brexit agreement bears many similarities to Theresa May\u2019s proposal with the biggest difference being the Northern Irish border. May\u2019s solution was to keep all of Britain in the European customs union, which Brexiteers vehemently opposed. In Johnson\u2019s deal, there is no hard land border and the entire UK would leave the EU customs union with the exception of Northern Ireland, which would be required to adhere to the same maze of EU customs rules and procedures on trading of goods \u2013 this in effect puts a customs and regulatory border down in the Irish Sea.\n\nNow, it all hinges on Super Saturday when Parliament will hold a marathon session to determine if they support Johnson\u2019s deal. If they approve the new withdrawal agreement, there are 2 paths: Parliament fast tracks the deal into UK law and they leave the EU on October 31 as scheduled or they get a technical extension to debate the details and set a new date for departure. In the EU\u2019s eyes, a deal is done so they\u2019ll agree to any extension. Either scenario should drive back to 1.30 and beyond. However if Parliament rejects Johnson\u2019s Brexit agreement, there could be a second referendum or a general election and an almost certain collapse in GBP.\n\nMeanwhile another round of weaker U.S. data drove the lower against all of the major currencies. and declined in September with starts falling by the largest amount in 7 months. The Philadelphia Fed survey also pulled back, reflecting a slowdown in that was confirmed by the larger pullback in . Coming on the heels of yesterday\u2019s softer report, today\u2019s numbers reinforced expectations for a Fed cut later this month. So far we\u2019ve seen very little pullback in and if the is as realistic as the market expects, we think the pair is due for a deeper correction toward 108.\n\nThursday's best-performing currency was the , which shot higher on the back of better-than-expected labor data. While slowed to 14.7K from 37.9K, the dipped to 5.2%. Full-time jobs increased 26K as part-time jobs fell 11.4K. These numbers tell us that despite the Reserve Bank\u2019s recent rate cut, the labor market in Australia is tight, which reduces the chance of further easing from the central bank. We think the RBA is done for the year and with expectations building for another Fed cut, AUD/USD could squeeze up to 70 cents.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, US Dollar Index Futures.
