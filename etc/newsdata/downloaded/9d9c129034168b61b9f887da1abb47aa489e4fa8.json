Indeed, Liverpool's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain may even have bettered Sabitzer's effort later in the night with his nonchalent flicked effort against Belgian champions Genk.\n\nOutrageous finish from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pic.twitter.com/GgLXy2dN7H \u2014 B/R Football (@brfootball) October 23, 2019\n\nAbsolute class from The Ox!! \ud83d\ude31\n\n\n\nFirst time \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutside of the boot \u2714\ufe0f\n\nIn off the crossbar \u2714\ufe0f\n\n\n\nHe's got his second of the night and it is truly sublime! pic.twitter.com/nqV2xBGnno \u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 23, 2019", "description": "Wednesday's early UEFA Champions League kick-off served up an exciting clash in Germany as Austrian winger Marcel Sabitzer's spectacular strike won the match for RB Leipzig against Zenit St. Petersburg.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db0b9632030277ceb161ef8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
