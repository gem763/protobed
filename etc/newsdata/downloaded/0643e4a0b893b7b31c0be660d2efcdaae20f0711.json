Elizabeth Warren, some major contributors want the former VP to take off the white gloves and to capitalize on an opportune moment of the subpoena flying impeachment inquiry.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nBiden did amp up his attacks on the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host on Wednesday, when he called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, centering on the president\u2019s July 25 phone call in which he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. Never one to miss a chance to kick up dust in his enemies\u2019 faces and his own, and double-down, Trump has now publicly called for the Ukrainians and the Chinese government to both probe the \u201ccrooked\u201d Bidens.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t make-or-break time for the Vice President, but it is time to start hitting Trump harder,\u201d said one top industry donor of Biden\u2019s responses to him, his family and his campaign. \u201cCalling for impeachment was one thing, but Biden needs to stop coasting and get out in front of this,\u201d the A-lister added.\n\nBack for another fundraiser swing through L.A. today and in search of catching up to Sen. Warren and other Dems in passing the hat around, Biden is scheduled to appear at two pricey showbiz-heavy events. There\u2019s an afternoon gathering at the home of ex-HBO chief and producer Michael Lombardo and an evening event at the home of Paramount boss Jim Gianopulos.\n\nNow, candidates are commonly showered with advice from donors, perhaps more so from those in Hollywood who see themselves as premiere experts in shaping narrative. But there has been some growing drumming beating from from the industry deep pockets that Biden\u2019s initial response was not aggressive enough after he swore to beat Trump like a drum, and then said the same thing over and over.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that they think Biden should do a 60 Minutes-style sitdown to go point-by-point through the Ukraine-Hunter Biden connection, as some believe that would be giving implicit credibility to Trump\u2019s attacks. However, there is a sense that Biden has an unique opportunity to break through, particularly at a time when the Massachusetts senator is drawing so much attention for her rise in the polls and fundraising.\n\n\u201cI think Biden is handling this the best he can right now,\u201d said political consultant Donna Bojarsky. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make yourself more of a target for the incendiary and baseless attacks by Trump and his allies. It\u2019s prudent to consider that.\u201d\n\nOne fundraising source pointed to Biden\u2019s speech on Wednesday as the type of remarks they want to hear more of. Biden said that Trump \u201cwill do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy. That\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s a fact. No president in American history has ever dared engage in such unimaginable behavior.\u201d\n\nAfter the Ukraine story broke, \u201cthe initial reaction was that his response was inadequate,\u201d said the fundraising source. \u201cBut the Biden campaign seems to have heard that, and seems to have adjusted in the last 48 hours.\u201d\n\nMike Murphy, the Republican strategist who co-hosts the podcast Hacks on Tap with David Axelrod, said that Hollywood donors \u201clook for performance. They value that more than anything.\u201d The Ukraine scandal has given Biden an opportunity to stand out from the Democratic field and frame the race as a general election campaign against Trump. Yet his performance against the president has \u201ckind of been on again, off again\u201d and \u201cat best uneven,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nHe added that \u201cBiden\u2019s problem is that when Hunter comes up, instead of pivoting and going on the attack, he kind of staggers.\u201d In other words, industry donors and activists want to see him go on offense, like bringing up Trump\u2019s children and their own business conflicts-of-interests.\n\nMurphy, too, thinks that Biden\u2019s speech on Wednesday was the kind of offense that industry donors are looking for \u2014 but want to see it more often.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: As Joe Biden heads into a full day of events and visits to the Hollywood ATM on Thursday, he feeling the heat from some of his most influential Tinseltown donors to get tougher with Donald Trump.
