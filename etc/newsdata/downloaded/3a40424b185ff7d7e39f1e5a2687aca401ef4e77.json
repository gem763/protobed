There are also growing concerns among environmentalists that Russia could seek to exploit increasingly accessible natural resources beneath the fragile ice cap.\n\nThe large-scale expedition involved 60 people and as well as visiting the melting glacier at Novaya Zemlya, found another previously undiscovered island off the Franz Josef Land archipelago to the north west.\n\nThe crew, travelling on a rescue towboat rather than an icebreaker, followed the paths of historical expeditions and studied the remnants of the military infrastructure of the Soviet period and the traces of the expeditions \u201cof past centuries\u201d, Tass reports.\n\nIn September, as a group from the expedition attempted to land at Cape Heller on Franz Josef Land, in an inflatable boat, they were attacked by a female walrus.\n\n\u201cThe walruses probably feared for their cubs and attacked the rubber landing craft,\u201d a statement by the Geographical Society said. \u201cThe boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore.\u201d\n\nDuring the expedition, crews also determined the maximum depth of the Barents Sea, found to be 632m (345 fathoms).", "description": "Russia has announced it has found five new islands after ice has melted from a glacier in the Arctic.
