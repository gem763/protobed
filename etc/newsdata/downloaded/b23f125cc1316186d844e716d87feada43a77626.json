According to the MayoClinic, they are most often a cosmetic concern, but in some cases they can lead to more serious issues. They are typically caused by damaged or weakened valves, but there are several risk factors that may be at play including age, sex, pregnancy, family history, obesity, or sitting or standing for long periods of time.\n\nPatients most often only experience visible symptoms such as dark purple or blue veins, or veins that appear twisted or bulged. But some patients can experience an achy or heavy feeling in the legs, burning, throbbing, cramping or worsened pain after sitting or standing for a long time. Patients may also experience itching or skin discoloration. Complications tied to varicose veins may occur, which according to MayoClinic may include ulcers, blood clots or bleeding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPhysicians may recommend exercise, leg elevation or wearing a compression stocking to help ease the pain or prevent varicose veins from worsening.
