(Juliet Linderman/AP)\n\nReporter\n\nGreg Miller, a Pulitzer Prize-winning national security correspondent for The Washington Post, is the author of \u201cThe Apprentice: Trump, Russia and the Subversion of American Democracy.\u201d\n\nIt has been more than six years since Edward Snowden landed at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow for what he expected to be a tense but temporary wait for a connecting flight on his way to asylum in Ecuador. Instead, he was stranded at the airport for 40 days in a futile search for safe passage beyond the reach of the U.S. government. When he finally left the terminal, it was as a pawn in a U.S.-Russia standoff, and he was confronting life as a permanent resident of Moscow.\n\n\u201cExile,\u201d he writes in his new memoir, \u201cis an endless layover.\u201d\n\nThe espionage abuses that Snowden exposed before he became a fugitive in 2013 \u2014 most notably the U.S. government\u2019s mass collection of unsuspecting Americans\u2019 phone records \u2014 look no less alarming in hindsight. But after the public reckoning he provoked came a wave of technology-driven crises: Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016, the racist manifestos that surfaced after mass shootings, the broader descent into dysfunctional public discourse.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to look at Snowden now and not see him as a figure from a bygone era, sounding warnings about grave dangers to privacy and liberty to a public that proceeded blithely to surrender reams of personal data to Facebook and other platforms.\n\nSnowden\u2019s book, \u201cPermanent Record,\u201d is an exploration of his disenchantment with a digital universe that, early in his life, he saw as a source of liberation, even salvation. He traces his rapid path from a tech-obsessed teen to positions of tremendous access at powerful U.S. spy agencies, culminating in his decision to expose the sweeping and invasive surveillance networks that the CIA and National Security Agency had erected in the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nSnowden demonstrates a knack for explaining in lucid and compelling language the inner workings of these systems and the menace he came to believe they posed.\n\nBut the consuming concern for personal privacy that he says compelled his leak works against him as the author of a memoir. He revealed some of the U.S. government\u2019s most closely guarded intelligence programs, but he withholds from readers any truly revealing material about his own life. As a result, \u201cPermanent Record\u201d is a book that mostly skims the surface of Snowden\u2019s relatively familiar life story. It becomes more energetic when he expounds on the architecture of sprawling computer systems that hoover up our personal data and the perils they pose to humanity.\n\nNo matter where you are physically, \u201cyou are also elsewhere,\u201d he writes in one of the book\u2019s most evocative sections. \u201cThe records of a life lived in Geneva dwell in the Beltway. . . . The videos of a funeral in Varanasi are up on Apple\u2019s iCloud,\u201d he laments. \u201cOur data wanders endlessly.\u201d\n\nSnowden doesn\u2019t point to any single moment when he crossed from conscience-wracked employee to \u2014 depending on your perspective \u2014 determined turncoat or whistleblower. It was a transformation that took place gradually.\n\nWhile Snowden is not completely forthcoming in his account of one of the most serious security breaches in U.S. history, he provides glimpses of his tradecraft. While working in 2012 at an NSA facility called the Tunnel, under a pineapple field in Hawaii, Snowden used his access as a systems administrator to begin assembling a library of documents on the agency\u2019s most far-reaching surveillance programs. Night by night, he probed the corners of the agency\u2019s network and copied the files to a micro SD card, the size of a fingernail, that he smuggled past security guards in the \u201cpried-off square of a Rubik\u2019s cube\u201d that he carried everywhere.\n\nHis ability to solve the Rubik\u2019s puzzle in seconds dazzled colleagues. He gave cubes as gifts to those he was seeking to dupe and gave them tips on how to solve them. \u201cThe more that people got used to them, the less they\u2019d ever want a closer look at mine,\u201d he reasoned.\n\nHe spent entire shifts filling up the data cards, then took them home and offloaded their contents onto an encrypted hard drive that he didn\u2019t even bother to hide; it sat on his desk in plain view of anyone who might enter.\n\nAfter assembling his collection of files, he began reaching out tentatively to journalists. Some of the most gripping passages in the book center on his forays around Oahu in a car loaded with a laptop and technical equipment. He would pilfer wireless signals from resorts and libraries to send encrypted messages to journalists, including the documentarian Laura Poitras and the columnist Glenn Greenwald. In these communications, he used the pseudonym \u201cVerax,\u201d speaker of truth, as a counterpoint to the adopted moniker of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange: \u201cMendax,\u201d speaker of lies. Throughout the book, Snowden distinguishes his leak \u2014 in particular his decision to turn over his trove to journalists who engaged in discussions with the government \u2014 from the unfiltered dumps that have become WikiLeaks\u2019 signature.\n\nAs he progressed with the plot, he became increasingly paranoid. \u201cI kept imagining a team of FBI agents lying in wait for me,\u201d he writes. But that team never materialized, and by 2013 Snowden was planning his endgame. That spring, he emptied his bank accounts and shoved the cash into a steel box for the girlfriend he was about to abandon. He told his employer \u2014 at that time he was working on contract to the NSA \u2014 that he needed to take an emergency medical leave. Then he disappeared, paying cash for an airline ticket to Hong Kong.\n\nThe outcome will be familiar to anyone who tracked the explosive stories that began running that May in the Guardian and The Washington Post, articles revealing that the NSA had collected a massive stockpile of data on millions of Americans and was exploiting secret relationships with tech powers including Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe revelations triggered what President Barack Obama grudgingly called an overdue \u201cnational conversation\u201d about the country\u2019s surveillance powers. In time, U.S. spy agencies were forced to retreat from operations that had stretched if not exceeded constitutional limits. The reports also showed the extent to which U.S. officials had for years misled the public about spy agencies\u2019 domestic capabilities.\n\nFor many who had been in charge of these programs, it was particularly galling that this had been engineered by a 29-year-old contractor. To some, that Snowden had acted unilaterally out of some sense of patriotic obligation bordered on megalomania. Those critics will find hints in Snowden\u2019s book of such grandiosity. Snowden berates himself for supporting the Iraq War, as if he somehow helped steer the country into that conflict. He proudly recounts episodes when he infuriated CIA bosses; refers to himself as a spy, when colleagues probably considered him support staff; and agonizes, sometimes out of proportion, over his role in erecting or maintaining the surveillance systems he exposed.\n\nSnowden was also widely suspected by U.S. intelligence officials of being an asset of Chinese or Russian intelligence, based on little more than the fact that he ended up seeking refuge in Hong Kong and Moscow. Snowden insists in the book that he never shared a single file with another government. Before leaving Hong Kong, he writes, he \u201cwiped my four laptops completely clean and destroyed the cryptographic key,\u201d which meant he could no longer access any of the documents.\n\nIn the latter section of the book, he describes a gripping scene when Russian officials \u2014 presumably from the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB \u2014 whisk him into a room where they pressure him to cooperate. Snowden says he cut them off. \u201cIf you want to search my bag, it\u2019s right here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I promise you, there\u2019s nothing in it that can help you.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, Russian authorities finally issued him a temporary visa for a stay that has now dragged on for six years. One of this book\u2019s greatest flaws is that it gives us almost no meaningful insight into that life of perpetual exile.\n\nSnowden describes how he was joined in Russia by his American girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, and offers their marriage two years ago as a happy ending.\n\nBut what is that existence really like? Does he have regrets? To what extent has he pursued a possible return to the United States? And most important, how has he adapted to life in a nation known for the sort of repressive surveillance that he feared was encroaching on his own country?\n\nThe speaker of truth doesn\u2019t answer.", "description": "In his memoir, he recounts how a Rubik\u2019s Cube helped him expose government secrets.", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bo-rFQmQPmtdHwoqaSk04tEhvWU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3LVZOGWKUI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
