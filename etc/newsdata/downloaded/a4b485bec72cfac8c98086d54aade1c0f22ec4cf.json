REUTERS/Bobby Yip/Files\n\nSpot gold was up 0.1% at $1,508.50 per ounce, as of 0609 GMT, after a near 1% drop in the previous session. U.S. gold futures were also up 0.1%, at $1,517.5 an ounce.\n\n\u201cThe renewed global risk appetite has spurred some weakness in safe-haven assets,\u201d said Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing short-term weakness (in gold prices), but in the long term the trajectory is still bullish.\u201d\n\nGlobal equity markets received a lift after China\u2019s central bank said on Friday it was reducing how much cash banks must hold in reserve, releasing liquidity to shore up an economy slowed by the Sino-U.S. trade conflict.\n\nData on Sunday showed China\u2019s exports unexpectedly fell in August as shipments to the United States plummeted, pointing to further weakness in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and underlining the need for more stimulus.\n\nRisk sentiment was also supported by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank would continue to act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to sustain the economic expansion.\n\nPowell\u2019s comments and a mixed U.S. employment report firmed market expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates at its meeting later this month.\n\nData from the Labor Department on Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, but strong wage gains should support consumer spending and keep the economy expanding moderately.\n\nLower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\n\n\u201cCentral banks across the globe look set to remain on a dovish path as the global economy slows, pushing bond yields lower, which helps to support the precious metal... This dynamic is further exacerbated by rising fears of recession,\u201d Fitch Solutions said in a note.\n\nInvestors now await the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting later this week amid hopes it would cut interest rates.\n\nHedge funds and money managers hiked their bullish positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to Sept. 3, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.\n\nSpot gold is expected to test a support at $1,497 per ounce, a break below which could cause a further fall to $1,453, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nSpot silver dipped 0.7% to $18.03 per ounce.\n\nSpot platinum fell 0.2% to $948.20 an ounce, while palladium inched 0.1% higher to $1,537.66.", "description": "Gold prices edged up on Monday as expectations of monetary policy easing by major central banks gathered momentum amid soft economic data, although an uptick in equities capped gains.", "authors": ["Eileen Soreng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427830342&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880DD", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
