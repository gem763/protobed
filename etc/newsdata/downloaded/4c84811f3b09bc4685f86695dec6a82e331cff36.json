Here\u2019s what travelers need to know.\n\nThe numbers: The airline is offering salary increases totaling 11.5 percent over three years, taking the average pilot from 167,000 pounds in salary and other payments and allowances annually, or about $205,000, to more than \u00a3200,000.\n\nThe pilots say that they are asking for slightly more \u2014 and that the strike will cost the airline around \u00a340 million a day. They plan another strike for Sept. 27.\n\nAdvance planning: British Airlines said it had contacted customers two weeks ago to offer a choice of full refunds or alternative flights, even on different airlines.
