It had previously forecast growth of 9% to 12%. GoPro also lowered its adjusted profit to 33 cents to 39 cents a share from 37 cents to 49 cents a share.\n\nProduction delays for its Hero8 Black camera, which it unveiled Monday, are expected to delay shipments to the fourth quarter from the third quarter. \"The revenue associated with those shipments will shift accordingly,\" CEO Nick Woodman told analysts on a call Wednesday. He estimates the revenue shift will be about $30 million, or 100,000 units.\n\nMr. Woodman added that the production delays didn't have anything to do with the company's decision to move some of its U.S.-bound production from China to Mexico, and had more to do with late-stage production delays.\n\nGoPro has previously faced production issues in the past few years that prompted shipment delays of its flagship products. In 2016 the company recalled its first drone product because a few of the units lost power during flight. It exited the drone market in 2018.\n\nThe maker of action cameras announced a slate of new products this week, including the Hero8 Black. The new camera has a price tag of $399. It is also offering different modular accessories, called Mods, that can be attached to GoPro cameras to expand its functionality. The Mods range in price from $49.99 to $79.99.\n\nThe new products are geared toward GoPro's more high-end consumers, Mr. Woodman said. The company has learned that it gets the best return when it can invest at the high end and \"deliver more 'wow' performance capability in those products,\" he said.\n\nCustomers can preorder the Hero8 Black and start receiving shipments by Oct. 15. Globally, the new camera will be available at select retailers beginning the week of Oct. 20.\n\nGoPro's shares have climbed 21% year to date.\n\nWrite to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com", "description": "GoPro Inc. lowered financial targets for the latter half of the year, due primarily to production delays for the latest Hero8 Black cameras.
