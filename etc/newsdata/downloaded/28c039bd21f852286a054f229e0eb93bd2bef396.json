REUTERS/Andreas Mortensen\n\nThe results come in a year which has seen Nordic bank shares tumble following a money-laundering scandal at Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE.CO).\n\nNordea, which has also struggled with declining profitability, reported an operating loss for July-September at 421 million euros.\n\nThat compared with the average expected profit of 905 million in a Refinitiv poll of six analysts.\n\nThe bank blamed the loss in part on 1.3 billion euros worth of one-off items including an impairment charge for IT intangibles, a restructuring provision, an additional loan loss provision and an expense related to a share sale.\n\nSeveral key executives, including the chief financial officer and chief operating officer, have left bank recently, marking the first moves under newly appointed CEO Frank Vang-Jensen.\n\nInterest income, the bank\u2019s most-watched income line, fell 4% versus the same period a year prior to 1.08 billion euros.\n\nNordea also announced financial targets for 2022, with a return-on-equity target of above 10% and cost-to-income ratio of 50%.\n\nNordea said it targets a dividend of 0.4 euros for 2019. Analysts\u2019 average forecast stood at 0.47 euros in the poll.\n\n($1 = 0.8980 euros)", "description": "Nordea Bank Abp , one of the Nordic region's biggest lenders, on Thursday reported its first quarterly earnings under a new chief executive, saying they were dragged down by surprise one-off charges totalling 1.3 billion euros ($1.45 billion).", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444370075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N09N", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
