If you want to help, you have to keep yourself focused and in relative calm, otherwise you can't think clearly.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nLater, Martinez said he went to the hospital to check on Dieu-Nalio.\n\n\"He was sent home after the doctors took care of him. He was resting and waiting to have the bullet removed. The doctors said that he was fine, and his condition wasn't life-threatening, so they sent him back home to be with his family.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nEarlier, Martinez captured Senator Willot Joseph as he scuffled with opposition supporters upon arriving at the Congress building in Port-au-Prince.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\n\"I've covered shootings before and have also photographed fights in official buildings, like in the National Assembly in Caracas in 2017 or recently in the Haitian parliament between lawmakers, but I never thought that I would see a politician using a gun like [Monday].\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Joseph holds a gun as he pushes an opposition supporter who was shouting at him\n\nAll pictures copyright.", "description": "Andres Martinez Casares describes how he reacted as a senator started shooting outside parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9FC6/production/_108920904_385badf0-bebd-4b04-8fcc-d680df60495e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
