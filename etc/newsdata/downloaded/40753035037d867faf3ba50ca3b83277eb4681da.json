It\u2019s something that\u2019s not lost on the cast and creator of the series, who chatted with Gizmodo at New York Comic Con this past weekend.\n\nWe asked The Expanse crew about special memories they\u2019ve had with their fans over the years. This ranges from folks flying out to see them on the night the show got renewed, to a hilarious case of mistaken identity at a bookstore.\n\nMy favourite encounter was Philadelphia Comic Con. We played Cara Gee\u2019s, Drummer\u2019s Belter rally \u2014 her big speech from season three, which is my favourite part of season three. And all the audience started, like, banging their chests and chanting along with it. And it was just so overwhelming. I cried.\n\nWes Chatham (Amos):\n\nThe funniest thing happened to me last weekend. I was in a bookstore. I was looking at the latest Stephen King book and I was talking to the guy. He\u2019s really passionate and he says, \u201cOh let me show you this other book.\u201d And as we\u2019re walking we passed The Expanse book series in the sci-fi section, and I said to him, \u201cHave you read these books?\u201d He goes, \u201cOh my God they\u2019re my favourite books. I love those books. Because you know they did TV show?\u201d And I go, \u201cNooooo.\u201d I said, \u201cHow is the TV show?\u201d He goes, \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. Oh it\u2019s amazing.\u201d And then I go, \u201cWhat do you think about Amos?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t who I would have cast...\u201d And I go, \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d And he goes, \u201cOh it\u2019s Wes Chatham, he was in\u2014\u201d I said, \u201cCan you show me a picture?\u201d And he Googled me and showed me me and still didn\u2019t connect! Then finally I said, \u201cDoes he look familiar?\u201d And then he looks and goes, \u201cOh my God.\u201d\n\nCara Gee (Drummer):\n\nThe night that the show was renewed at that conference, when Jeff Bezos announced, it was so surreal. To share that with them was really extremely special. Also, anytime I see someone dressed up as Drummer I\u2019m just, like, it blows my mind. It\u2019s the coolest thing in the world to know that someone put that effort in. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s such a look.\n\nNaren Shankar (showrunner) and Steven Strait (Holden):\n\nShankar: For me, it was actually the night that the show got picked up. We had just gone to do this panel at the Space Sciences Conference. And in the lobby, like, we met just suddenly a bunch of guys who had come from the Save The Expanse [campaign] \u2014 who were running the whole thing. They had travelled from Belgium to Los Angeles just for this evening. And these guys have put together incredible fan videos, and they had organised it. It was kind of astonishing. Strait: I mean, they rented a plane at one point and then flew the Save The Expanse banner around the Amazon headquarters for a day.\n\nThe Expanse returns with season four on December 14.", "description": "The main reason The Expanse is getting a fourth (and fifth!) season on Amazon Prime is because of the fans.
