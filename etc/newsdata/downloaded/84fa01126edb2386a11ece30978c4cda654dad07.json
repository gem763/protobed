We are not there yet and it is disappointing.\n\nThe former Sint-Truidense VV assistant coach then slammed his charges as he believes they only raise their game against big teams.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can stand for this, maybe it is short-minded to have Pirates next and raise the game,\" he continued.\n\n\"But it won't sit well with me because I can\u2019t coach players who have that small mentality of preparing for big games.\n\n\"Then you up your level, but the games which matter and then those are the ones which you don\u2019t show up in. But we will work hard this week.\"\n\nThe retired striker will be looking to ensure City maintain their dominance over his former side on Saturday.\n\nThe Citizens are undefeated in their last four matches against Pirates across all competitions having recorded two wins and two draws.\n\nPirates and City, who are placed 10th and 11th respectively on the league standings, will clash at Orlando Stadium.", "description": "The 41-year-old tactician has slammed City players as he feels they only raise their game against big clubs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6y45HXdkANwB9NrX2yQDuA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0.RNFAqBKt9Ao5P7ASU2Uw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/0b934e4ccf5bb99cee48e9905e75dde5", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
