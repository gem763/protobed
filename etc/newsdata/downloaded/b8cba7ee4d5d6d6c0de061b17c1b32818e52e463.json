Chole-bhature? Chaat? Pizza?\n\nI am craving a nice big hot chocolate sundae with extra almonds and extra chocolate sauce, obviously. Now, if there is no way I can eat hot chocolate fudge sundae and there is chocolate cake at home, no amount of chocolate cake is going to make me feel as satisfied as a hot chocolate fudge sundae would. And vice-versa.\n\nIf you are craving for chocolate cake and opt for hot chocolate fudge sundae, you won't be satisfied either. If I eat hot-chocolate fudge sundae and chocolate cake but I am cry, I won't be satisfied even then.\n\nI can bet this is an all too common experience for all of us.\n\nBut do you know why this happens? Why we churn out immense satisfaction from food?

What do you think will happen then?\n\nYou know, in all honesty, eating a hot chocolate fudge sundae all day everyday sounds like a dream but by the end of day two, we would all be sick of it. It's possible to detest the damn sundae even before day one. Makes sense right?\n\nWhat gives a certain food power to satisfy you depends on your ability to deprive yourself of it.\n\nPexels\n\nThat is why, true satisfaction is about fulfilling a desire and enjoying it. That's what gave rise to the concept of cheat days. Instead of cheating everyday and feeling guilty, people started reward themselves one entire day to eat what their heart desires and enjoy eating that thing.\n\nSatisfaction is not equivalent to being stuffed. So go out and eat what your appetite and body is demanding, once in a while. Because then there's nothing to be ashamed about.", "description": "That is why, true satisfaction is about fulfilling a desire and enjoying it. That's what gave rise to the concept of cheat days.
