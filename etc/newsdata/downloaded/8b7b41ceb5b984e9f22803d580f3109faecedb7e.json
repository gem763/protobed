Defense officials said there is currently a backlog of about 303,000 security clearances \u2014 down from high of 725,000 in April 2018.\n\nOfficials said they aim to cut the number to 200,000 by the end of the year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
