Scott Applewhite/Associated Press William Taylor arriving on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nIf Tuesday\u2019s congressional testimony by William Taylor, the acting United States envoy to Ukraine, is to be taken at face value \u2014 and no one in the Trump administration has yet denied a word of it \u2014 then it is now beyond doubt: President Trump placed his personal political future above the national-security interests of the United States. He did so at the expense of longstanding foreign policy, a critical international alliance and the stability of the global order \u2014 and he used hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to do it.\n\nThe nation has known the basic outlines of this story for weeks, thanks to the bravery of a C.I.A. whistle-blower and others. But in 15 pages, Mr. Taylor laid out with a stunning degree of detail the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to extort Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son over supposed corruption.\n\nGallery: Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes (Photo Services)\n\nYou know it\u2019s bad for the president when the only response the White House can muster is to sidestep the testimony and complain instead about \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nWould that be the same Constitution that Mr. Trump referred to, in part, as \u201cphony\u201d just this week? Also, \u201cradical unelected bureaucrat\u201d is a curious way to describe Mr. Taylor, who currently serves as Mr. Trump\u2019s acting envoy to Ukraine and is a retired career civil servant and Vietnam War veteran who has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents.\n\nMr. Taylor described to lawmakers how, after agreeing to take over as interim head of the United States Embassy in Ukraine last spring, he soon realized something was very wrong. There were \u201ctwo channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular.\u201d The regular one was what it had long been: support, with bipartisan backing in Congress, for Ukraine against Russian aggression from the east. The irregular one was a concerted effort, led by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, to get Ukraine to investigate purported corruption by Mr. Biden and his son, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 United States election.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Former Ambassador William Taylor leaves a closed door meeting after testifying as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2019.

But Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t care about details like that \u2014 he is hungry to damage Mr. Biden and he wanted Mr. Zelensky to state publicly that there would be a thorough investigation. He dangled two carrots: a White House visit and nearly $400 million in desperately needed military aid that the United States had promised to Ukraine for its war with Russia.\n\nMr. Taylor\u2019s alarm bells went off when, shortly before one call with Mr. Zelensky, Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, said he didn\u2019t want most of the normal interagency participants to be on the line, and didn\u2019t want anyone monitoring or transcribing the call.\n\nLater, Mr. Taylor said, Mr. Sondland told him that \u201ceverything\u201d \u2014 the White House visit and the military aid \u2014 depended on Mr. Zelensky\u2019s willingness to start a high-profile, public investigation. That sure sounds like a threat to withhold money unless Mr. Zelensky did the president\u2019s bidding \u2014 what sticklers might call a quid pro quo. Mr. Trump has denied this, repeating \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d as though it were a magical incantation. After reading Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony, I don\u2019t think that phrase means what the president thinks it means.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Ambassador William Taylor is escorted by U.S. Capitol Police as he arrives to testify before House committees as part of the Democrats' impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2019.

In an interview with \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d that aired Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said, \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d)\n\nWhat comes through most clearly in Mr. Taylor\u2019s written testimony, which he supplemented with oral testimony to three House committees behind closed doors, is the sheer shock that an American president would be so reckless with both human lives and international relations, all for his own political gain.\n\nMr. Taylor laid out the real-world stakes of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to play politics with Ukraine\u2019s military aid. He recalled a visit to the front lines in eastern Ukraine that he and Kurt Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, made in late July, from where they could see armed Russian forces gathered on the other side of a bridge. \u201cOver 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 21: U.S. President Donald Trump listens to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a cabinet meeting at the Cabinet Room of the White House October 21, 2019 in Washington, DC.

The other is a positive one \u2014 about \u201ca young nation, struggling to break free of its past\u201d and eager to \u201cenjoy a more secure and prosperous life.\u201d Mr. Taylor might have added that there are also two American stories \u2014 one in which politicians use foreign policy to maneuver for domestic advantage, and one in which there is bipartisan support for fledgling democracies that share our values and there are diplomats who devote their lives to delivering on that support.\n\nIn that America, there should be no room in the Oval Office for someone like Donald Trump.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
