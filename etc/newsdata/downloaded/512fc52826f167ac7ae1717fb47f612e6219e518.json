We scratched together some runs at the right time.\u201d\n\nCarson Kelly and Nick Ahmed started the final rally with back-to-back singles off John Brebbia (3-4), who was the Cardinals\u2018 11th pitcher of the night. Jarrod Dyson and Robbie Ray - a pitcher who had to pinch hit - struck out before Christian Walker was intentionally walked to load the bases.\n\nThen it was Vargas\u2019 turn to be the hero again, smacking a single - his fourth hit of the game - through the left side of the infield. He raised his hands as players rushed the field.\n\n\u201cI was so excited, just pumped up,\u201d Vargas said through an interpreter.\n\nIf Vargas hadn\u2019t come through with the game-winning hit, he was going to be on the mound in the 20th inning because the D-backs were out of available pitchers.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much to go on - that was it,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cLuckily, we didn\u2019t have to find out how that looked.\u201d\n\nThe game last 6 hours and 53 minutes and featured 24 pitchers and 48 strikeouts, with both teams plowing through bullpen arms thanks to September\u2019s expanded rosters. The Diamondbacks used a franchise-record 30 players. It was the longest game by innings and time in Chase Field history.\n\nWith the Rockies beating the Giants in 16 innings earlier, it marked the first time since June 8, 2013 - Mets-Marlins and Blue Jays-Rangers - more than one game went at least 15 innings the same day, according to MLB Stats.\n\nThese two teams were set to play again in Phoenix 11 hours later.\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly tough turnaround for the Cardinals, who are locked in a playoff race with the Milwaukee Brewers. St. Louis had its lead in the NL Central cut to 2 1/2 games over Milwaukee. The Cardinals have four games remaining and the Brewers have five.\n\nThe Cardinals\u2018 bullpen blew two one-run leads, once in the ninth inning and again in the 13th as they wasted a stellar outing from starter Jack Flaherty.\n\nSt. Louis manager Mike Shildt said the team\u2019s confidence wouldn\u2019t be shaken.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good spot,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing good baseball. Played good baseball tonight. Played clean. 19 innings and no errors. Played the game well. Just came up short.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt looked like he\u2019d be the hero after giving the Cardinals a 2-1 lead in the 13th when he hit a homer for the second straight night in his return to Chase Field. The six-time All-Star spent his first eight seasons with the Diamondbacks before being traded to St. Louis last offseason.\n\nTurns out, there was much more baseball left to play.\n\nAhmed started the D-backs\u2019 13th inning rally with a triple and then Dyson drew a walk off John Gant. Pinch-hitter Caleb Joseph ripped a single through the right side of the infield to tie the score at 2-2, but the rally stalled when Walker hit into a double play and Vargas grounded out.\n\nSeveral hours before the game\u2019s conclusion, Flaherty continued his run of outstanding pitching with seven brilliant innings, including a no-hitter through six, but Andrew Miller couldn\u2019t hold a 1-0 lead in the ninth.\n\nWith one out, Vargas stunned the Cardinals with a solo shot that just cleared the fence in right-center field and tied the game. Miller retired the next two batters.\n\nThe Diamondbacks looked like they might rally in the 11th when Tim Locastro hit a one-out single. With two outs, Vargas hit a high chopper for an infield single but Locastro was thrown out at third when he barely slid past the bag while trying to take an extra base.\n\nFlaherty, who finished with 11 strikeouts, has been brilliant for the Cardinals as they\u2019ve charged to the top of the division. The right-hander has a 0.97 ERA during the second half of the season and has given up just seven earned runs over the past two months.\n\nDexter Fowler provided the Cardinals\u2018 early offense, leading off the game with a solo homer to right field. It was Fowler\u2019s 18th homer of the season, and 26th leadoff homer of his career.\n\nLET\u2019S GET HYPE\n\nBy the 15th inning, the D-backs\u2019 and Cardinals\u2018 benches appeared to be having a good-natured contest to see who could be the most raucous and obnoxious when cheering. It was easily heard because most of the Chase Field crowd was gone.\n\nWEIRD NO-HIT ENDING\n\nFlaherty\u2019s no-hitter ended on a strange play when a hard ground ball from Eduardo Escobar hit the seam between the dirt and grass and bounced behind Paul Goldschmidt, who tried to reach back with his bare hand, but couldn\u2019t make the play.\n\n\u201cIt was hooking toward the line,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cIt hit the lip on the turf and bounced back the other way. Tried to grab it with my bare hand. Weird.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (6-7, 4.68 ERA) allowed one run over four innings and in his previous outing against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly (12-14, 4.31) will head to the mound to begin a game that starts at 12:40 p.m. local time. He\u2019ll bring a 15-inning scoreless streak into the game.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona had ample reasons to be a beaten-down ballclub one day after being officially eliminated from the National League playoff race.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/aptopix_cardinals_diamondbacks_baseball_75160_c0-186-4438-2773_s1770x1032.jpg?d15ddae4d2c9c944039c9c82ed3ab58bc0e6a69a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
