UPDATE 3-Hengyuan, Petron unable to offload crude oil at Malaysia's Port Dickson\n\n(Adds Hengyuan official comment)\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Refineries at Port Dickson on\n\nPeninsular Malaysia's west coast are unable to receive crude oil\n\nafter a port facility that carries crude from the ships to the\n\nplants broke down.\n\nA system known as a single point mooring (SPM) unit, a\n\nloading buoy anchored offshore that allows tankers to offload\n\ntheir crude via pipeline to the refineries, has been out of\n\nservice, the refinery operators said.\n\nThe SPM connects to a refinery operated by Hengyuan Refining\n\nCompany Bhd (HRC) , a subsidiary of China's Shandong\n\nHengyuan Petrochemical Co, and a second plant owned by the\n\nPhilippines' largest refiner Petron Corp .\n\nPetron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd (PMRMB)\n\nconfirmed that its Port Dickson refinery cannot receive crude\n\noil to produce refined products due to an SPM problem, and said\n\nit had taken necessary measures to import more refined products\n\nto meet its needs.\n\nThe SPM is anticipated to return to normal operations by\n\nearly November and the company's temporary inability to process\n\ncrude oil at the refinery will not impact its supply of finished\n\nproducts to the market, PMRMB said. A Shandong-based official with Hengyuan's parent company\n\nconfirmed the refiner was replacing a broken valve of the\n\npipeline of the SPM unit, but said he has no knowledge how long\n\nthe repair work would take.\n\nHengyuan's refinery has a capacity of 156,000 barrels per\n\nday (bpd), while Petron's refinery has a crude distillation\n\ncapacity of 88,000 bpd, according to their websites.\n\nThe outage appears to have delayed two ships that were\n\nscheduled to unload at the port, shipping data on Refinitiv\n\nEikon showed.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell has chartered the Maran Plato, a\n\nSuezmax-sized tanker, to discharge on Oct. 18 and the Torm\n\nValborg, an Aframax-sized vessel, on Oct. 16, the data showed.\n\nBut the tankers were still anchored off the port laden with\n\ncrude as of Tuesday, the data showed.\n\nShell declined to comment.\n\nWhen contacted by Reuters, the Port Dickson Marine\n\nDepartment said the companies that have operations in Port\n\nDickson run their own mooring operations and the department was\n\nnot aware of any delay in shipments as they did not receive any\n\ncomplaints.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 3-Hengyuan, Petron unable to offload crude oil at Malaysia's Port Dickson", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEBAI13Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
