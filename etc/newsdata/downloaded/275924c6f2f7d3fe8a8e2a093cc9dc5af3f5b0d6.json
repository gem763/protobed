REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nAfter a downturn in the first half of 2018 when farming plunged, the economy has struggled to regain momentum, posting a shock contraction in the first quarter of this year.\n\nAnalysts said while the second-quarter GDP print could see South Africa avoid recession in 2019, it was not enough to stop credit rating downgrades linked to debt issues including bailouts for state power utility Eskom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great relief. A huge positive, but in reality it won\u2019t do much for the credit rating situation. That\u2019s more about debt,\u201d said Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at FNB Wealth and Investments.\n\nThe rand extended gains after the data, firming more than 0.5% to a session high of 15.1125.\n\nGDP growth in the three months to June was 3.1%, after a revised contraction of 3.1% in the first quarter, Statistics South Africa said. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted an expansion of 2.4% for the quarter.\n\nThe second-quarter growth was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2017. Year-on year GDP growth was 0.9% compared with zero previously.\n\nMINING TURNAROUND\n\nThe data showed mining output grew by 14.4% in the second quarter, after declining by 10.8% previously. Manufacturing output rose 2.1%, rebounding after declining 8.8% in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cThere was a strong rebound in iron prices in the months leading to this quarter ... and remember with mining in the first quarter there were challenges with electricity supply and those have eased a bit,\u201d said Mike Manamela, chief director for national accounts at the statistics office.\n\nGrowth in Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy hinges heavily on saving power firm Eskom, which is drowning in debt. At the start of the year, it implemented power outages that triggered a slowdown across most sectors in the first quarter.\n\nFixing Eskom, which supplies more than 90% of the power in South Africa, is one of the biggest challenges Ramaphosa faces.\n\nIt is regularly cited by ratings agencies as one of the main threats to South Africa\u2019s investment-grade credit rating status and economic growth prospects.\n\nMoody\u2019s, the last of the three big international ratings agencies to keep South African debt at investment grade, said in July that government\u2019s proposal to provide additional financial support to Eskom was \u201ccredit negative\u201d.\n\nThe government said it would give Eskom 59 billion rand ($3.87 billion) of additional financial support over the next two years, on top of an already-promised bailout of 230 billion rand spread over the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe could avoid a recession this year with even zero growth in the next quarter,\u201d said Isaah Mhlanga, chief economist at Alexander Forbes.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s absolutely no room for Ramaphosa to manoeuvre. The macroeconomic fundamentals are still very weak.\u201d\n\nThe IMF has warned that South Africa\u2019s public debt, forecast at 55% of GDP in February by Treasury but likely to be revised upwards at the October mini-budget, is reaching uncomfortable levels.\n\n($1 = 15.2369 rand)", "description": "South African GDP grew more than expected in the second quarter thanks to a recovery in mining and manufacturing, official data showed on Tuesday, in a reprieve for President Cyril Ramaphosa as the economy looks set to dodge recession this year.", "authors": ["Mfuneko Toyana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425752266&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8211N-OZABS"}
