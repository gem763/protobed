Mr. Kerry told The New York Times in 2004 that any effective Afghanistan plan \u201crequires destroying terrorists. And I\u2019m committed to doing that. But I think I have a better way of doing it.\u201d\n\nFive years later, Mr. Obama overruled warnings from his ambassador in Kabul that his administration\u2019s plan to surge troops into the country, then depend on the Afghan government to defend itself, would probably not work. Speaking at West Point, Mr. Obama said he had \u201cdetermined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.\u201d Quietly, his White House set up an \u201cAfghan Good Enough\u201d committee to find an exit.\n\nThe current presidential candidates seem uninterested in revisiting those decisions. Instead, they race to reassure voters about how quickly they would bring the remaining 14,000 troops home.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics"], "top_image": ""}
