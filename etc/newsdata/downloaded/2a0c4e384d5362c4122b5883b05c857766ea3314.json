He is wearing a T-shirt and dark shorts, and is seen raising his hands and sticking his tongue out.\n\nMr. Trudeau appeared in costume at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d-themed gala, in a photo from a West Point Grey Academy school newsletter about the 2001 event.\n\nThe events have upended his campaign ahead of an Oct. 21 election in which polls show his Liberal Party in a dead heat with the rival Conservatives. The Liberals had clawed back from a fall in popularity in the first half of this year, under the weight of allegations that he and his senior aides tried to politically interfere in a criminal prosecution of a Montreal engineering firm. That scandal undermined his promise to run an ethical, transparent government.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trudeau apologized for the second time over the blackface scandal. \u201cWhat I did hurt people who shouldn\u2019t have to face intolerance and discrimination because of their identity,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters at a press conference in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \u201cThis is something I deeply, deeply regret.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s first apology came Wednesday night after Time magazine published a photo from 18 years ago in which he appeared wearing dark makeup at an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d-themed costume party for a Vancouver private school where he was a teacher. Mr. Trudeau, who was 29 years old at the time, said he now recognizes what he did was racist.\n\nMr. Trudeau said there was another time in high school in Montreal when he wore blackface in a talent show and sang \u201cDay O,\u201d also known as the \u201cBanana Boat Song.\u201d An image has since emerged of that event. Mr. Trudeau didn\u2019t mention wearing blackface in the early 1990s on Wednesday night.\n\nAndrew Scheer, the leader of Canada\u2019s Conservative Party, said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s omission undermined his initial apology.\n\n\u201cHe committed a racist act and lied about the extent of the number of times he had done such a thing,\u201d Mr. Scheer said in a campaign stop in Quebec. \u201cAfter his inability to tell the truth Wednesday, he\u2019s continuing to show Canadians that he\u2019s not fit to govern this country.\u201d\n\nReporters pressed Mr. Trudeau about the possibility of more images with him wearing blackface. \u201cI am wary of being definitive about this because I did not remember the recent photos that came out,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said.\n\nMr. Trudeau held a conference call with Liberal candidates from across the country Thursday, in which he expressed deep regret for his behavior, Liberal lawmaker William Amos said.\n\nMr. Amos said he was disappointed by the photos but hopes Canadians accept Mr. Trudeau\u2019s apology. \u201cIt\u2019s a heartfelt apology from a leader who has been nothing short of a champion on issues of multiculturalism, anti-racism, promotion of diversity and pluralism,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Liberal candidates contacted Thursday either expressed support for Mr. Trudeau or referred questions to Liberal Party headquarters.\n\nMr. Trudeau said he didn\u2019t tell aides he previously wore blackface until he learned Time was asking about one of the photos. \u201cI was embarrassed, particularly given the person that I\u2019ve become and the leader I\u2019ve tried to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about it with anyone because I\u2019m not that person anymore.\u201d\n\nThe images are particularly problematic for Mr. Trudeau, whose advocacy for diversity and inclusiveness is one of the principle tenets of his leadership. He led an effort immediately after coming to power to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees into Canada. He has also promoted women and minorities to senior ranks and apologized for the past treatment by authorities of the gay and lesbian community.\n\nShachi Kurl, executive director of polling firm Angus Reid Institute, said the biggest risk for Mr. Trudeau is that blackface revelations could thwart efforts to coalesce younger, left-leaning voters behind the Liberals.\n\n\u201cThese are the people he not only desperately needs to support him, but also actually show up and vote,\u201d Ms. Kurl said. \u201cIt could be one more sign for them that he\u2019s not who he says he is.\u201d\n\nIn a busy east Toronto neighborhood lined with Indian and Pakistani restaurants and shops, reaction was split.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw the photo last night, I thought this is outright racism,\u201d said Kshitiz Sharma, a Mississauga law student who immigrated from India four years ago.\n\nInder Jandoo, who has owned a store in this South Asian neighborhood since 1979, said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s blackface costume doesn\u2019t undermine his values or reputation as Liberal politician.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago he was not preparing himself to be prime minister. This is not that serious a problem,\u201d Mr. Jandoo said.\n\nThe leader of Canada\u2019s left-wing New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh, said the photos and video are insulting and could be troubling for young Canadians dealing daily with racism. Mr. Singh is a Sikh who wears a turban. \u201cThis is so hurtful for so many Canadians,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Trudeau has a lot to answer for.\u201d\n\nSamya Hasan, executive director of the Toronto-based Council of Agencies Serving South Asians, said the images were hurtful and demeaning. However, she added, the people her organization serves aren\u2019t \u201cas short-minded to look at one thing and let that decide how our next four years are going to be.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jacquie McNish and Vipal Monga contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com\n\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tried to contain the fallout from a growing firestorm after a series of images emerged of him wearing blackface and brownface, damaging his reputation as a progressive champion of diversity amid a tough bid for re-election.", "authors": ["Paul Vieira", "Kim Mackrael", "Paul.Vieira Wsj.Com", "Kim.Mackrael Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108710/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
