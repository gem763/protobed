The oil-producing western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, long Conservative strongholds, shut out the Liberals. French-speaking Quebec experienced the resurgence of the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which more than tripled its representation in Parliament.\n\nBridging those chasms and tamping down on polarization will be a critical test for Trudeau\u2019s government.\n\nWith most of the vote counted on Tuesday, the Liberals had won 157 seats in the House of Commons, more than any other party but shy of the 170 needed for a majority, a setback that leaves them reliant on the support of smaller parties to stay in power.\n\nAndrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives edged out the Liberals in the popular vote but trailed with 121 seats. Trudeau became the first prime minister in decades to win the election while losing the popular vote; Scheer said the Conservatives had put Trudeau \u201con notice\u201d \u2014 and were ready to take over when his government falls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge is clear. Minority governments in Canada have seldom lasted longer than 18 months, and rarely has the country been so polarized.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing mood in the country is pessimistic,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of the polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs in Toronto. \u201cThere is a significant group of people that aren\u2019t happy about what happened. Couple that with the geography, and you could have a combustible situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrains of regionalism have existed for a long time in Canada,\u201d said Daniel Beland, director of the Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cBut they are re-emerging at the federal level.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, it was unclear which parties the Liberals would turn to as partners in a minority government, or how they would try to govern. Precedent suggests that Trudeau will seek the support of the other parties to pass bills on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThat could pose a conundrum: Gaining the support of the smaller parties might require him to make compromises that further alienate the people who turned their backs on him in this election.\n\nIn an election night speech to supporters in Montreal, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, whose party rode a wave of Quebec nationalism to capture 32 seats Monday, called on all the parties \u2014 Liberal, Conservative, the Bloc, New Democrat and Green \u2014 to work together \u201cdespite the deep divisions that we see in the electoral map.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut then he laid down a few red lines. His party would not support any attempts to put a pipeline through the province. And it would always defend its efforts to enshrine secularism within Quebec, including the controversial provincial law that bans some public-sector workers from wearing religious symbols such as hijabs or yarmulkes on the job.\n\nTrudeau, who represents a riding in Montreal, has refused to rule out challenging that law, which many outside Quebec oppose, potentially teeing up a future conflict.\n\nAnalysts said Trudeau doesn\u2019t necessarily need to rely on support from Blanchet\u2019s party to advance his agenda. A more likely ally would by Jagmeet Singh\u2019s left-leaning New Democrats, which won 24 seats.\n\nAD\n\nBut that could create a challenge in oil-rich Alberta and Saskatchewan, where anger over falling oil prices because of pipeline bottlenecks and the Liberal government\u2019s energy policies are inflaming a level of grievance and regional alienation not seen in decades. Those provinces are challenging the Trudeau government\u2019s nationwide levy on carbon in court.\n\nSingh\u2019s NDP has called for more urgent action on climate change. The party opposes some pipeline projects, including Trudeau\u2019s Trans Mountain pipeline, which oil producers and Conservative lawmakers argue is critical to the energy industry, the region and the nation.\n\n\u201cThe NDP will push the Liberals even further left on environmental policy, which could generate even more regional resentment in oil-producing provinces,\u201d Beland warned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his victory speech in a Montreal convention center on Tuesday morning, Trudeau promised that his government would \u201cfight for all Canadians.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow that you are an essential part of our great country,\u201d he said to Alberta and Saskatchewan. \u201cI heard your frustration and I want to be there to support you.\u201d\n\nBut he extended the olive branch while Scheer was in the middle of his concession speech in Regina, Saskatchewan \u2014 he had flouted the convention of waiting for the other leaders to concede before launching into his victory speech.\n\nThe optics weren\u2019t great.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot of anger out here right now,\u201d said Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Alberta. \u201cI think Trudeau ignores this at his peril.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The prime minister\u2019s Liberals performed well in Atlantic Canada but lost seats in French-speaking Quebec and were shut out of oil-producing Alberta and Saskatchewan.", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yn_bQPUJXy3fNeG-esMQ0qMtAWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV2NIEXU2QI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
