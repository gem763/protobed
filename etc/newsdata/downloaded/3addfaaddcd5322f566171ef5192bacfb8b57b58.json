Its colour can tell you and your doctor a lot about what\u2019s going on in your body. While this is not enough to diagnose anything outright, it offers a unique glimpse into your body\u2019s strange ways of telling you that something\u2019s up.\n\nClear mucus\n\nClear mucus is totally normal. The body naturally produces about 1.42 litres of it every day \u2013 enough to fill a large ice cream container. It keeps your nasal passages lubricated and germ-free by acting as a moisturising barrier against dehydration and foreign objects, including bacteria and viruses. But if the amount drastically increases, it could mean you\u2019re suffering from allergies or the start of a cold or flu.\n\nWhite mucus\n\nThis could mean a bunch of different things. Most often it means that your nasal passages are irritated and swollen, restricting mucus flow and causing it to dry out. This could be due to a nasal infection or a cold. But dairy products, allergies, and eating dehydrating foods such as coffee, tea, and alcohol can also turn your mucus white. Acid reflux (also known as heartburn) or dry conditions may also be the culprit.\n\nVideo of Is Eating Boogers Actually Unhealthy?\n\nYellow mucus\n\nWhen you have an infection, your immune system\u2019s white blood cells rush to the site to fight and destroy the pathogenic invader. After they\u2019ve done their job and die, they\u2019re flushed out of your body with your mucus, and in the process can dye it yellow. Yellow mucus doesn\u2019t mean that you need antibiotics, but it means your body is fighting something; possibly a cold. At this point, you may want to wait it out and hope things don\u2019t improve after 10 to 14 days.\n\nGreen mucus\n\nYour mucus can turn green from the even larger build-up of dead white blood cells. This potentially means that your body is using many reinforcements to fight the infection, and perhaps it\u2019s losing the battle. This is especially true if your mucus has been green for a few weeks or longer. If that\u2019s the case, you should see your doctor; especially if you have a fever or feel nauseated.\n\nDo-it-yourself experiments: How far does a sneeze travel?\n\nRed mucus\n\nBloody mucus signals that there\u2019s a lot going on in your nasal passages, including dryness and irritation, and the tissues have become damaged. This be due to allergies, infection, and lots of blowing or rubbing. Physical trauma \u2013 like walking into a wall, face-first \u2013 can also turn your snot red\n\nBrown mucus\n\nWhen blood from your nasal lining dries, it can mix with the mucus and turn brown. But brown mucus isn\u2019t always because of blood. It could also be dirt, dust, or discolouration from inhaling smoke. If you\u2019re coughing up brown mucus, though, you should see a doctor because this could be a sign of bronchitis (or inflammation of the bronchial tubes which carry air from your nose to your lungs).\n\nBlack mucus\n\nBlack mucus can materialise after inhaling dirt or dust; or after smoking cigarettes. It can also signal a serious fungal infection, especially if you have a compromised immune system. If your mucus is black for no obvious reason, you should see a doctor. This is especially true if you have a fever, chills, or have difficulty breathing.", "description": "The gooey substance is produced by special cells in your nose to keep dust, bacteria and other foreign particles from entering your lungs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/sneeze_mucus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
