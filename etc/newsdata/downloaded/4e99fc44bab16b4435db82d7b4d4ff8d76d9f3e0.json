Meanwhile, watching parties are planned around the country, with a long weekend and 9pm kick-off delighting fans, many of whom must travel from remote areas to pubs and hotels to ensure they get decent coverage.\n\nOne fan is so confident of an All Blacks win, he has already had a tattoo celebrating the victory inked, while those working night shifts are turning their phones, internet and TV off to avoid spoiling the outcome. As the game approaches, rugby talk has hit saturation point, with the New Zealand Herald examining the UK media\u2019s analysis of the All Blacks and turning advertisements on its homepage black, while Stuff ran a national world cup \u201cRWC Mood-O-Meter\u201d, rating the current station of the nation as \u201cNo Worries\u201d.\n\nStuff\u2019s RWV Mood-O-Meter Photograph: Stuff\n\n'It\u2019s in the DNA': New Zealand feels strain ahead of All Blacks opener in Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nAt parliament house in Wellington politicians were also gearing up, with the speaker of the house, Trevor Mallard, donning a signed All Blacks jersey to deliver his weekly Facebook update.\n\n\u201cShowing my support for the All Blacks this weekend \u2013 does the jersey go well with the speaker\u2019s robes?\u201d Mallard said in his Facebook caption.\n\nSports and recreation minister and mega-fan Grant Robertson will be watching the game live at Yokohama Stadium and said he was beginning to feel jittery about the outcome.\n\n\u201cLike I imagine a lot of New Zealanders will be, I am a bit nervous but I am also quietly confident the All Blacks are going to take the win,\u201d Robertson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important with games at this stage of the World Cup to take nothing for granted \u2013 England will be giving it everything they\u2019ve got, but so too will the ABs.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New Zealand speaker of the house Trevor Mallard showing off his All Blacks supporters jersey under his speaker\u2019s robes Photograph: Facebook/Trevor Mallard\n\nThe prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will be watching too. Following New Zealands win against Ireland last week she posted an Instagram picture of the victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re right behind you for the semis,\u201d Ardern said.\n\nWilliam Nelson, 27, a rugby fan from Hawkes Bay, said England was the only team who could potentially spell defeat for the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much more nervous about this game than I was about Ireland \u2013 I think England are the only team that have a decent chance of beating us and I think whoever wins the semi-final will go on to win the World Cup,\u201d Nelson said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited too as I think it will be a super entertaining game. I just hope the game doesn\u2019t get decided by a controversial referring call \u2013 but in saying that I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got Nigel Owens as the referee \u2013 he\u2019s the best referee in the game by a fair margin in my opinion.\u201d\n\nSports psychologist Steve Jackson has advised fans to keep expectations low to avoid disappointment.\n\n\u201cPeople forget, they think the All Blacks are the favourites, but New Zealand has a lot less money and resources than many other countries,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cThe All Blacks are actually the underdogs, they are expected to win, which is a lot of pressure, but the reality is they do amazingly well with very little. And I think trying to reframe things as \u2018we\u2019re the underdogs going in\u2019 is probably a better way of looking at it in terms of managing anxiety about the outcome.\u201d\n\nJackson said in New Zealand \u201cmore people go to rugby games than go to church; the passion for the game is extreme\u201d, but also that some Kiwis were growing fatigued of rugby\u2019s dominance in the cultural psyche and fed up with the violence and excessive alcohol consumption that is often associated with match nights.\n\n\u201cI do see a growing number of people resenting the prominent place rugby has in New Zealand\u2019s story \u2013 that it has displaced almost any other form of culture.\u201d\n\nJackson said there had been no definitive studies linking poor mental health outcomes in fans if their favourite teams lose, though there was strong anecdotal evidence that more violence could occur in homes and pubs, and moods could dip for days following a significant loss.\n\nSean Cuttance of Methven in the South Island is a rugby coach and former professional player. He said he would be disappointed if the All Blacks lose on Saturday, but he\u2019ll survive \u2013 partly due to his professional rugby training.\n\n\u201cAs a coach I do understand fans mental health can take a knock [if the All Blacks lose]. Kiwis love their rugby and it means a lot to them,\u201d says Cuttance.\n\n\u201cBut I know listening to the All Blacks themselves and coaching and management staff, they\u2019re very pragmatic about a win or a loss and they\u2019re not so emotional and that\u2019s a good way to lead it..\u201d", "description": "Nerves, excitement and wall-to-wall coverage as All Blacks prepare to take on England in do-or-die match in Japan", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/debd8bf4e072dc526b0f89775aee494692795626/0_198_2999_1802/master/2999.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be236937d522b39de325659d07e61008", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
