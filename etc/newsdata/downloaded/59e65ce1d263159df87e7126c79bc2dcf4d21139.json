It didn't fall from a plane, FAA says", "language": "en", "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a mysterious object that may have fallen from a plane and hit Tommy Woosley's mobile home in Burgin, Mercer County, Kentucky, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration says the mysterious object that damaged a Kentucky man's mobile home earlier in October did not come from an airplane.\n\nAnd Norfolk Southern Railway says its nearby rail lines have nothing to do with the canister-type object that hit the home in Burgin, roughly 75 miles southeast of Louisville.\n\nWhat about the National Guard or the Fort Campbell military base? Could the object have possibly come from one of their units?\n\nNope.\n\nAll that news \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 leaves Tommy Woosley still wondering about the origin of the object that damaged a wall and part of his bathroom.\n\n\"Seems to me that they should be able to trace the bar code on this thing to see where it came from,\" Woosley told The Courier Journal in a message Wednesday.\n\nBoeing 737 Max fallout: Blasting Boeing, FAA, safety panel recommends changes in certification process\n\nUFO sightings: These videos have been called UFO sightings for years.

The object was a type of canister, about 2 inches round and 10 inches long and \"very heavy for the size,\" Woosley previously said.\n\nAuthorities initially believed the canister may have fallen from an airplane, but an FAA spokeswoman told The Courier Journal that an investigation \"has determined that the object is not an aviation part.\"\n\nFAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the agency reached out to Norfolk Southern \"to ask if it could have come from a rail line that's near the home.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Norfolk Southern spokesperson said the railroad company confirmed that the damage to Woosley's home \"was not caused by part of a Norfolk Southern engine or any (Norfolk Southern) device. Norfolk Southern was not involved.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration says the mysterious object that damaged a Kentucky man's mobile home earlier in October did not come from an airplane.
