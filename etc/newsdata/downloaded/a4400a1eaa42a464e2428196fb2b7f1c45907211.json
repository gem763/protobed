According to sources, Lim, a veteran TV writer whose breakout feature film was working on the \"Crazy Rich Asians\" screenplay, was offered $110,000-plus to work on the follow-up, a small fraction of the $800,000 to $1 million on the table for Chiarelli.\n\n\"Being evaluated that way can't help but make you feel that is how they view my contributions,\" Lim tells THR.\n\nLim originally walked from the Warner Bros deal last fall and another counteroffer in February that still wasn't the amount she felt was fair. The entertainment company reportedly explained to Lim's representatives that the quotes were industry-standard ranges based on experience, and that making an exception would set a troubling precedent in the business.\n\nLim began her Hollywood TV career in 2000 and has worked on series including \"One Tree Hill,\" \"Private Practice\" and \"Lethal Weapon.\" Her co-writer, Chiarelli, found his big break in Hollywood writing for the movie \"The Proposal\" in 2009. After learning about the discrepancy between himself and his co-writer, Chiarelli reportedly volunteered to split his higher earnings with her to reach parity.\n\n\"Pete has been nothing but incredibly gracious, but what I make shouldn't be dependent on the generosity of the white-guy writer,\" Lim tells THR. \"If I couldn't get pay equity after [\"Crazy Rich Asians\"], I can't imagine what it would be like for anyone else, given that the standard for how much you're worth is having established quotes from previous movies, which women of color would never have been [hired for]. There's no realistic way to achieve true equity that way.\"\n\nWorking on \"Crazy Rich Asians\" was like writing \"the love letter to my people I never had a chance to write,\" the Malaysian-born writer and producer has said. She was hired directly by director Jon Chu in an effort to add cultural specificity, as well as emotional authenticity, to the script \u2014 a requirement before Michelle Yeoh, who plays the film's matriarch Eleanor Young, agreed to sign on. Together with Chu, Lim created a pivotal scene original to the movie \u2014 in which Eleanor and her would-be daughter-in-law play a charged game of mahjong \u2014 that the director calls the most important of the film.\n\nLim told THR she believes women and people of color are often regarded as \"soy sauce,\" meaning she sees diversity hires being made to sprinkle culturally-specific details on a screenplay rather than substantially craft it from the ground up.\n\nLim joined the \"Crazy Rich Asians\" screenwriting team after the film's production studio had already enlisted Chiarelli's work. The studio spent five months fielding other writers of Asian descent after Lim turned down the job the first time, before it came back with another (unsuccessful) offer.", "description": "The blockbuster's female co-writer would have earned one-eighth of her male colleague's pay, at best.", "authors": ["Jennifer Liu"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105403583-1534530426782cra.jpg?v=1567778620", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
