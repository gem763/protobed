But even more important was the ultimate outcome of the Manchurian battles, which culminated in Pearl Harbor and the Pacific War between Japan and the United States.\n\nIt might be hard to believe that all this began with a few insignificant hills and steppe. Yet both sides had tangled before. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, the new Japanese Empire\u2014dismissed by the Tsar's forces as racially inferior Asiatics\u2014sank the Russian navy, outfought the Russian army and seized the strategically important harbor of Port Arthur (which the Russians themselves had previously extorted from China). During the Russian Civil War in 1919, Japan sent 70,000 troops to support the anti-Communist White Army. The Imperial Japanese forces nearly annexed Siberia before withdrawing.\n\nThere was little love lost between either side, especially in the ultra-militaristic atmosphere of the 1930s. Japan lurched towards fascism while Stalin bulked up Soviet industrial and military power for the inevitable clash with capitalism. Indeed, the Russo-Japanese conflict was in some ways a battle of mirror images. Whether it meant dying for Stalin or the Emperor, both sides cared nothing for how many of their men perished on the battlefield.\n\nThe fuse was first lit at the beginning of the 1930s, when Japan's aggressive Kwantung Army\u2014on its own initiative\u2014occupied China's Manchurian territory in 1931, creating a disputed 3,000-mile frontier between Japan and Russia.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Overwhelmed, Japan learned from its mistakes.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bOi8w2hYvOZkaOCNCdymUw--~B/aD04MDE7dz0xMjUwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/2133372e60f353ad4115f29a3cb418e8", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
