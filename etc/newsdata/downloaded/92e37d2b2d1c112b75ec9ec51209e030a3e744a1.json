Mr. Uccellini then asked the Birmingham staffers to stand to rousing applause.\n\nMr. Uccellini\u2019s comments came as the controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s Sept. 1 claim that Alabama would likely be in the path of the storm dragged into a second week. At the time, forecasters weren\u2019t expecting the state to be directly affected, and the president was quickly accused of using outdated information. But Mr. Trump has aggressively defended the statement, including displaying a doctored map that added Alabama to the path of the storm.\n\nLate last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the NWS, issued an unsigned statement criticizing the Birmingham forecasters.\n\nRelated Air Force Reviews Travel Policies Amid Scrutiny Over Trump Resort\n\nThe acting chief scientist for the NOAA took issue with his agency\u2019s response in an email to its employees Sunday. The email from Craig McLean, first reported by the Washington Post, was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. In it, he said he is investigating whether the agency\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets constituted a violation of NOAA policies and ethics.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political,\u201d Mr. McLean wrote. He added: \u201cIf the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products, that specific danger arises.\u201d\n\nMr. McLean added that he is pursuing any \u201cpotential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\u201d\n\nResponding to the email, NOAA spokesman Scott Mullen said in a statement that \u201cNOAA\u2019s policies on scientific integrity and communications are among the strongest in the federal government, and get high marks from third-party observers. The agency\u2019s senior career leaders are free to express their opinions about matters of agency operations and science. The agency will not be providing further official comment, and will not speculate on internal reviews.\u201d\n\nDan Sobien, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, said he was concerned that the spat over the storm\u2019s path was politicizing public-safety information.\n\n\u201cI think what is important, what is extremely important is that the American public can trust the forecast and warnings the National Weather Service is putting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot allow politics to get in the way of weather forecast and warnings. It\u2019s going to cost people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "The head of the National Weather Service offered a robust defense of forecasters who contradicted President Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian posed a threat to Alabama.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105439/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
