Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations\n\nThey were charged in the case last week alongside Ukraine-born Lev Parnas (right) and Belarus-born Igor Fruman (left). They worked for Giuliani in Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his businessman son Hunter\n\nCorreia and Kukushkin are scheduled to appear in court again on December 2.\n\nThe judge granted a request from Kukushkin to remain in California where a $1 million bail package limits where he can go beyond home to work, legal visits and medical appointments.\n\nParnas and Fruman, who were arrested at Dulles International Airport near Washington last week, are scheduled to make their first appearance in federal court in Manhattan on October 23.\n\nFruman was released on bail on Wednesday, while Parnas has not yet met his bail conditions and remains jailed in Virginia.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in California announced they would review the dozen state marijuana distribution licenses granted to a partnership involving Kukushkin to make sure there were no improprieties.\n\n'We always have concerns when something like that happens, so we want to do our due diligence and look at them,' said Lori Ajax, chief of the California Bureau of Cannabis Control.\n\nAll the state licenses issued to the partnership of Garib Karapetyan and Kukushkin are provisional permits, Ajax said, pending detailed background checks and disclosure of major investors.\n\nKarapetyan's attorney, Brad Hirsch, said his clients are in complete compliance with all regulations.\n\nSeparately, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg called for an investigation of his city's permit system to determine how Kukushkin and another businessman obtained nearly one-third of the licenses issued by the city.", "description": "David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin are among four men charged with using straw donors to make illegal contributions to politicians they thought could help their political and business interests.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19859160-0-image-a-9_1571348734606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
