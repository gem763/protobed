You will always be taken seriously and the incident will be fully investigated.'\n\nShah now faces jail after he was convicted of sexual assault at Isleworth Crown Court\n\nMandy McGregor, Head of Transport Policing at TfL, said: 'This attack on a vulnerable passenger was predatory and disgusting, and we are pleased to see that Shah has been convicted.\n\n'I would like to thank the young woman for coming forward and reporting this so TfL and the police could investigate and take action against the driver. We expect the highest standards from TfL licensed taxi and private hire drivers.\n\n'Not only has Shah been convicted but immediate licensing action was taken to prevent him from continuing in his role as a TfL licensed private hire driver.'", "description": "Temur Shah, 45, picked up the woman in London's West End in the early hours of January 15 last year and agreed to take her to her home to the north of the capital.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19738916-0-image-a-23_1571141082939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
