(Michael Nelson/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAfter causing an international political uproar, video game giant Activision Blizzard has reduced the suspension of a Hong Kong-based pro player of the Blizzard game Hearthstone to six months and will restore his prize money.\n\nThe same six-month suspension goes to the two casters whom Blizzard initially fired after they ducked their faces out of the camera\u2019s view as Ng \u201cblitzchung\u201d Wai Chung expressed support for the protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe specific views expressed by blitzchung were not a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: Our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,\u201d said Blizzard Entertainment President J. Allen Brack in a Friday evening statement. \u201cIf this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.\u201d\n\nBlizzard\u2019s actions sparked a furor, even within Congress, for appearing to bend a knee to China. Tencent, a Chinese entertainment conglomerate, owns a 5 percent stake in Activision Blizzard, and China is a sought-after market in the entertainment world, particularly in gaming.\n\n[Blizzard won\u2019t ban American players after Hong Kong protest, but team plans to forfeit over boycott]\n\nBrack said blitzchung \u201cplayed fair,\u201d and that the company now believes he should receive his prize money of $3,000. He was initially banned from competing for one year.\n\nAll this comes weeks before a planned protest at the company\u2019s popular annual gathering of fans BlizzCon. Fight for the Future, an online freedom activism group, called for an umbrella protest of companies that cater to China\u2019s interests. And online chatter of Blizzard\u2019s community across various social media platforms showed they fully intended to participate.\n\nIt will take some time to see whether Blizzard\u2019s statement would quell the furor. Prominent YouTube industry critic Jim Sterling remained unconvinced.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision. It just happened to be a decision that exactly mirrors what dozens of other corporations have been doing to appease the Chinese government.\u201d -a more accurate Blizzard statement. \u2014 Sterling! (@JimSterling) October 12, 2019\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have been a common rallying point for social activists in recent months. A proposal by Hong Kong to allow extraditions to China sparked the movement, as it was seen by some as an attempt by Beijing to pick apart the autonomy and liberties promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nThe NBA is also dealing with political fallout from a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s tweet in support of the protesters. All of this is set against President Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China and its economic fallout.\n\nBlizzard has invested in China\u2019s esports scene through its Overwatch League, placing franchises in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Chengdu. Tencent, a Chinese entertainment giant, owns a 5 percent stake in Blizzard\u2019s parent company, Activision Blizzard, and serves as the NBA\u2019s rights holder in China.\n\nActivision Blizzard is also seeking Chinese approvals for its \u201cCall of Duty Mobile\u201d game, according to the Wall Street Journal. That game saw a record-breaking 100 million downloads in its first week. Releasing it in China, where mobile gaming is a larger phenomenon, would reap even more financial rewards for the largest gaming company of the West.", "description": "After international uproar, the American gaming giant eases punishment for Hong Kong player who expressed his political views on China.", "authors": ["Gene Park", "October At Pm", "Gene Park Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Video Games", "Gaming Culture.
