He was named man of the match.\n\nBright spark Matheson is currently studying A-levels in history, sociology and psychology - and he had to ask teachers for permission for a day off from those studies so that he could play against United in last month's Carabao Cup game.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter another teenager, Mason Greenwood, had given United the lead, Matheson smashed home a half-volley 14 minutes from time to force a penalty shootout, eventually won by the Red Devils.\n\nMatheson said of playing at Old Trafford: \"I've never played anywhere like it, with a crowd of that size before.\n\n\"So to start and score was just a dream come true. They call it the Theatre of Dreams for a reason and my dreams definitely came true.\"\n\nFor Matheson - who has also been tracked by Chelsea in the past - that dream of playing at the biggest stadiums could become a day-to-day reality if he keeps impressing.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe would appear to be a good fit for either Manchester club.\n\nUnited boss Solskjaer is intent on snapping talented young homegrown players as he bids to return the Red Devils to the top of the English game.\n\nAnd as for City, they are currently in the midst of a defensive injury crisis and would no doubt be glad of some quality back-up coming through the ranks.", "description": "Rochdale are braced for a January auction over right-back who scored Carabao Cup equaliser against United at Old Trafford last month", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733931.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Rochdale-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round-Old-Trafford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
