The president must sign off on covert actions, which must also be briefed to key members of Congress responsible for intelligence.\n\nBut according to a provision in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, such missions are not covert actions but \u201ctraditional military activities\u201d and therefore do not require presidential authorization, nor do they have to be briefed ahead of time to Congress. By declaring them to be traditional military activities, the provision also placed clandestine cyber operations under the purview of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, rather than the intelligence committees.\n\nThat move is fraught with significant risks, according to critics, including that foreign powers will retaliate against Cyber Command\u2019s military missions by launching cyberattacks against private American firms. \u201cThat\u2019s not a consideration that our normal military operators are used to calculating,\u201d said Suzanne Spaulding, a former undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security who previously worked as a lawyer for the CIA and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nA defense official said Spaulding\u2019s concerns were misplaced, however. \u201cTo suggest that military personnel aren\u2019t used to weighing repercussions on the civilian population is simply not accurate,\u201d the defense official wrote in an email. \u201cCyber Command routinely coordinates with governmental partners to understand the potential risks and impacts to the private sector.\u201d\n\nEscalating tensions in the Persian Gulf in the wake of the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities have raised fears among Democratic lawmakers that President Trump could take military action against Iran without congressional authorization. Yet the ability of Cyber Command to conduct cyber missions before even notifying the president or Congress appears to have raised few hackles on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen-U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush talking with Tower Commission members investigating the Iran-Contra affair.

W. Bush, when in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal the government engaged in an internal debate over how to oversee covert action, according to John Rizzo, former acting general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. It was these discussions that produced the requirements for covert actions to be personally approved by the president and briefed to the so-called Gang of Eight \u2014 the Senate majority and minority leaders, the speaker and minority leader of the House, as well as the chairs and ranking members of the Senate and House intelligence committees.\n\nAlthough the military already had secret units conducting operations that might otherwise have been considered covert action, the Defense Department argued successfully that what it termed \u201ctraditional military activities\u201d should be exempt from these requirements and remain under the purview of the armed services committees. \u201cIt was a big point of contention,\u201d said Rizzo, who took part in the negotiations. \u201cThey were terrified of getting into the covert action reporting and oversight regime.\u201d\n\nIn addition to cyber attacks, the Pentagon\u2019s carve-out has also affected areas such as low-visibility special operations missions and information operations.", "description": "Escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf in the wake of the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities have raised fears among Democratic lawmakers that President Trump could take military action against Iran without congressional authorization.", "authors": ["Sean D.
