Now, African swine fever is set to tear through those markets, killing off business as surely as the fatal disease decimates vast herds of pigs once raised on U.S. crops.\n\nPigs are seen at a farm outside Hanoi, Vietnam September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Kham/Files\n\nU.S. feed crop exports to countries like Vietnam, Myanmar and the Philippines surged nearly 50% last year to a record 12.3 million tonnes. That helped to cushion the blow of a slump that wiped out nearly three-quarters of China sales of the same crops as Washington and Beijing exchanged tit-for-tat trade tariffs.\n\nBut the scale of the shipments to Southeast Asia that could be lost due to the incurable pig disease highlights the headache for growers in the U.S. grainbelt: Unless a trade deal unlocks China, farmers will have little option but to stockpile, not sell their crops.\n\n\u201cThere will probably be a drop in hog production (in the Philippines) and also in demand for commercial feeds, just like what has happened in other countries,\u201d said Edwin Chen, president of the Pork Producers Federation of the Philippines. Feed grain demand is already slowing in the country, the world\u2019s fourth-largest soymeal importer, after outbreaks of the disease.\n\nThough not harmful to humans, African swine fever is deadly to pigs, with no vaccine available. It surfaced for the first time in Asia more than a year ago, in China, and has now spread to over 50 countries, according to the World Organisation of Animal Health - including those that account for 75% of global pork production.\n\n\u2018WHAT IT TAKES\u2019\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s mix of large population, sprawling cities, fast-growing economies and limited feed crop production have helped fuel a near-25% expansion in its corn and soymeal imports in the past five years.\n\nThe region has established itself as the third-largest market for those commodities, making any sharp slowdown in demand all the more alarming for suppliers.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Corn and soymeal imports by region tmsnrt.rs/2mgH2tQ)\n\nThe rapid growth has also ensured stiff competition for the business, with exporter organisations regularly dispatching trade missions in the fight to gain market share.\n\nThe U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC) is one such body. It has helped promote sales of American farm products across the region as part of its \u2018What it Takes\u2019 strategy, designed at least partly to offset lost sales to China.\n\n\u201cThe diversification of markets has been a primary focus for USSEC for several years, prior to the U.S.-China trade situation,\u201d said Rosalind Leeck, USSEC Regional Director of North Asia.\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. exports of corn, soybeans and soybean meal to top consumers tmsnrt.rs/2nl60IW)\n\nThose efforts paid off for the U.S. in 2018, when sales of bulk crops and soymeal into Southeast Asia reported their largest-ever annual gain, surpassing exports to China for the first time.\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. crop and soymeal exports to Southeast Asia and China tmsnrt.rs/2l6HP0n)\n\nSPREADING DEVASTATION\n\nThese hard-won gains are now at risk of being reversed by African swine fever: Since Southeast Asia accounts for 15% of total corn and soymeal imports, any substantial downturn in animal numbers will lead to a commensurate drop in feed crop imports.\n\nAccording to two traders who sell U.S. and South American crops into the region, corn and soymeal purchases are expected to drop by roughly 1 million tonnes each this year in Vietnam alone. The traders declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media.\n\n(Outbreaks of African swine fever tmsnrt.rs/2nsxi0l)\n\nIn Vietnam, the world\u2019s sixth-largest pork producer, about 4.7 million pigs have already been culled as African swine fever has spread to all 63 of the country\u2019s provinces since being detected in February. By end-July, the country\u2019s pig herd had shrunk by 18.5% to 22.2 million animals.\n\n\u201cIn my village, there are a lot of pigs infected with swine fever,\u201d said Nguyen Thi Hai, a pig farmer at Tu Nhien village, outside Hanoi, in business since 2006. \u201cAt least, more than half of them (were) infected and killed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Thailand - the world number five soymeal importer - this month began culling pigs amid heightened fears of a potential outbreak of African swine fever after the death of two hogs without explanation in a province close to swine fever-hit Myanmar earlier this month.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nFor now, industry watchers say Asia\u2019s farmers and U.S. grain exporters will need to strap in for a bumpy ride.\n\n\u201cIt has been a big blow to feed demand as China has culled more than 30% of its herd,\u201d said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney.\n\n\u201cNow it is spreading into Vietnam, the Philippines and South Korea. It is more bad news for feed grains growers in America and livestock farmers in Asia.\u201d", "description": "Last year, Southeast Asian farms offered a lifeline to U.S. grain exporters wounded in a bitter trade war with China.
