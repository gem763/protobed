Funds managed by JPMorgan were early WeWork investors.\n\n\"I absolutely think that it will come up. The relationship was significant, it was a huge, high-profile IPO that was canceled, and reputationally, the deal being canceled with JPMorgan as the lead is not positive,\" James Shanahan, analyst at Edward Jones, told Business Insider.\n\nWeWork is seeking a $1 billion lifeline from SoftBank, its biggest investor, which it hopes to parlay into a $3 billion debt deal with JPMorgan, according to a Reuters report on Monday. WeWork's new co-CEOs are meanwhile planning huge job cuts and looking to sell non-core businesses.\n\nRead more: Wall Street gave Adam Neumann up to $500 million he was going to pay back after WeWork's IPO. Now that the offering is pulled, banks are scrambling to hammer out a solution.\n\nTo be sure, JPMorgan and other banks are also grappling with factors like Fed interest rate cuts and general macroeconomic and political uncertainty. Analysts are looking for color on those topics and potential impacts on net interest income, loan growth, and trading and investment banking revenue.\n\nAnd some said WeWork is not setting off any alarm bells, especially given JPMorgan's sheer size.\n\n\"It's a headline, don't get me wrong. But when you have a balance sheet the size of theirs, where total assets now are $2.7 trillion, and total loans are about $950 billion, it's not something that's going to derail the company,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy told Business Insider.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts devoted a section of a big-bank earnings preview to potential WeWork writedowns. But they believe JPMorgan would avoid a hit because of how it has accounted for private investments.\n\nJPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan and UBS private wealth execs explain why they're doing more private share-backed lending to Silicon Valley. Both banks have lent to WeWork CEO Adam Neuman\n\nLending relationships\n\nAnalysts will have their eyes on any potential credit-related issues tied to lending to WeWork and Neumann.\n\n\"If there's any earnings implication within third-quarter results, it would have to be credit-related,\" said Shanahan.\n\nNeumann has referred to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon his \"personal banker,\" according to Vanity Fair, and Business Insider reported that Dimon and Neumann met in late September to hammer out how to get the IPO and financing back on track (that was before WeWork pulled the offering entirely.)\n\n\"It's something that we're all paying attention to of course \u2014 it's not too often that you find out ahead of time who has the credit relationships with large companies,\" Cassidy said. WeWork's S-1 filing detailed the co-working company's and Neumann own borrowing from JPMorgan and others.\n\n\"It wouldn't surprise me if the question comes up, and it wouldn't surprise me if we hear a response that 'we don't talk directly about relationships with our customers,'\" Cassidy said.\n\nLast week, we reported Neumann is working with banks to consider new terms for the $500 million credit line he took out from JPMorgan, UBS, and Credit Suisse before the failed IPO. He's drawn down $380 million, and the credit line is backed by WeWork shares.\n\n\"Presumably there's some equity value in WeWork still, and that would be theoretically recoverable. But that's where I would see some issues for JPMorgan \u2014 if they determine that some portion of the outstanding debt that they have with WeWork is presumed to be uncollectable or impaired in some way. You may see loss provisions,\" Shanahan said.\n\nNeumann also borrowed $97.5 million from JPMorgan across products including mortgages secured by personal property.\n\nOne place to keep an eye on is the bank's total delinquent or non-performing loans. Should the relationship with WeWork and Neumann result in that total as a percentage of overall loans rising, the bank could address that change.\n\n\"That might be something that would get called out. But we don't expect it to be delinquent,\" Cassidy said.\n\nWeWork shares\n\nWhen Jefferies announced results in late September, it took a writedown of $146 million on its WeWork stake.\n\nJefferies said in a statement the writedown as of the end of August reflected uncertainty around timing and pricing of an IPO, and that \"as the facts at We become clearer, further adjustments may be made.\"\n\nThat caught the eye of large-cap bank analysts at Morgan Stanley. They wrote in an Oct. 4 note that it's possible banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, both early investors in WeWork, could take similar hits.\n\nHowever, they said because of how JPMorgan appears to be valuing WeWork shares, they did not envision a writedown this quarter. The note's key questions for JPMorgan's analyst call included the bank's loan growth and credit outlook, IBD pipeline, and \"how to manage conflicts in the business model,\" among other factors.\n\nThose analysts did estimate a $264 million WeWork writedown in Goldman's investing and lending business, which houses the firm's own bets, saying Goldman typically takes \"event-driven\" write-ups or write-downs.\n\nPulled IPO, knock-on effects\n\nWith the WeWork IPO shelved, JPMorgan is no longer positioned to rake in about $100 million in fees from that offering, plus a $50 million structuring fee for $6 billion in debt from various lenders contingent on WeWork raising $3 billion by the end of 2019.\n\nBut those fees wouldn't have been booked until they were received by JPMorgan, so any fee income from an IPO and JPMorgan structuring financing would have accrued in the fourth quarter.\n\nTo the extent that the failed IPO process reflects an opportunity cost in terms of compensation or other expenses, there's likely to be little visibility or impact.\n\n\"Because JPMorgan is so large, I would be surprised if they had to call out the costs associated with taking the company public and the offering was pulled,\" Cassidy said, noting that while WeWork was going to be a \"good-size offering,\" it's not big compared to JPMorgan's total balance sheet.\n\nWeWork had been valued at $47 billion in its last SoftBank-backed funding round, but according to media reports mulled massive valuation cuts to pull off going public.\n\nThen there's the question of what knock-on effects WeWork's flop and rocky public debuts for money-losing companies like Lyft and Uber could have on other planned IPOs.\n\n\"I think the markets could support IPOs, but not when there's been such a poor track record recently,\" Shanahan said.", "description": "Here's what analysts say they'll be looking for when JPMorgan reports earnings next week.
