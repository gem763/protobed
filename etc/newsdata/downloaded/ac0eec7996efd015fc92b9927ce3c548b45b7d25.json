Council member Jack Evans\u2019s \u201cethically compromised\u201d behavior when he was Metro board chairman, including whether he and an ally tried to obstruct the inquiry that led to his resignation from the panel.\n\nTwo top GOP congressmen on the House Oversight Committee wrote to their Democratic counterparts on the panel Tuesday, calling for the committee staff to conduct \u201ctranscribed interviews\u201d with Evans and four current and former Metro officials.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said further investigation is warranted, partly because Metro documents suggest Evans (D) and former board member Corbett A. Price sought to block the board\u2019s ethics committee investigation of Evans and conceal its results.\n\nThe Washington Post obtained a copy of the letter and an accompanying staff memorandum describing the GOP concerns.\n\nThe initiative appeared designed in part to highlight the scandal over Evans, a longtime D.C. Council member, as a way to undercut support for District statehood and to tighten federal oversight of Metro.\n\nA congressional hearing on D.C. statehood is scheduled for Sept. 19. Opponents of statehood have often cited corruption in District politics as a reason to oppose it.\n\n[Evans to resign from Metro board after probe shows he \u2018knowingly\u2019 violated rules]\n\nJordan is the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, and Meadows is the ranking GOP member of the panel\u2019s government operations subcommittee. Those panels oversee the District and Metro, respectively.\n\nThe letter was addressed to Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and the subcommittee chair, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.).\n\n\u201cThe information produced to the Committee to date suggests that Evans attempted to exploit his position on the [Metro] Board for his personal financial benefit,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis investigation has a direct bearing on matters currently before the Committee, including the announced hearings on statehood for the District of Columbia and [Metro] oversight.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans noted that while the Metro board\u2019s ethics committee investigated Evans\u2019s business dealings, there has been no probe of evidence that Evans and Price sought to obstruct the inquiry.\n\nConnolly said his subcommittee would address the Evans controversy and Metro safety issues at an Oct. 22 hearing. He did not say whether he would support the deeper investigation sought by the GOP. \u201cThe documents provided to our Committee confirm my serious concerns about Mr. Evans\u2019s unethical behavior,\u201d Connolly said in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn a blind eye to this type of self-dealing and threats.\u201d\n\nMetro board chairman Paul Smedberg said he has accepted an invitation to testify at the hearing, at which he plans to share \u201cthe ethics improvements that, as the board\u2019s new chair, I am advancing.\u201d On Thursday, the Metro board will consider changes in its much-criticized ethics procedures, including requiring that ethics findings be made public and that the agency\u2019s inspector general play a bigger role in investigations.\n\nCummings\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Post reported last month that Evans threatened the jobs of Metro\u2019s general counsel and board secretary in an effort to keep secret that the agency\u2019s ethics committee had found Evans committed a violation, according to confidential agency documents and current and former Metro officials. Evans was supported by Price, who badgered Metro General Counsel Patricia Y. Lee and made false statements about the inquiry\u2019s results.\n\n[Jack Evans threatened Metro officials\u2019 jobs in an effort to conceal ethics violation, documents show]\n\n\u201cThe concerted effort by a jurisdiction [the District] to derail an investigation to protect one of its own should be investigated thoroughly to ensure Committee members are in possession of all available information, particularly in light of upcoming hearings announced by Chairman Cummings to consider D.C. statehood,\u201d the nine-page memo accompanying the GOP letter said.\n\nThe scandal led both Evans and Price to resign from the board.\n\nJordan and Meadows called on the Democratic-controlled committee to interview Evans and four Metro officials whom documents have identified as being familiar with the efforts to obstruct the ethics probe: Lee, former ethics committee chairman Clarence C. Crawford, board corporate secretary Jennifer Green Ellison and Metro Senior Vice President Lynn M. Bowersox.\n\n[Corbett Price, under fire for concealing ethics violation, resigns from Metro board]\n\nIn describing in detail the allegations of Evans\u2019s ethical violations, the GOP staff memo reviewed information that has previously been made public. It drew on more than 900 pages of confidential documents from the Metro ethics committee\u2019s investigation, which the Republicans requested from Metro in July and which have previously been reported by The Post.\n\n\u201cThese documents suggest that Evans was ethically compromised and that he sought and obtained personal financial benefit in return for official actions,\u201d the memo said.\n\nIt cited three broad areas where it said Evans may have committed ethical violations \u2014 by helping a parking company with which he had an undisclosed consulting contract paying $50,000 a year; by working on behalf of a digital sign company with which he had a consulting arrangement for a time; and by using his position on the Metro board in an attempt to advance his personal business opportunities.\n\nAn outside law firm retained by Metro found Evans committed multiple ethics violations in those three areas. But the four-member ethics committee could reach agreement only that Evans committed a single violation, by failing to disclose his consulting contract with the parking company.\n\n\u201cThe information we have received so far raises serious concerns,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cCongress and District residents need to have complete confidence that the local leaders are accountable and above reproach.\u201d", "description": "Republicans say the controversy is relevant to debates over D.C. statehood and Metro oversight.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/69dn-kyxJZ5FcIRWoi6utrNJZog=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OE3ZIPUY6YI6TGQW3RKR5JNEHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
