Chris Sutton, whose own father, Mike, has dementia, believes that Taylor had failed his members and should apologise.\n\nRachel Taylor's father, Rod, last year became the second British footballer after Astle to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a type of dementia caused by head trauma.
