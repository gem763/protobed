He was arrested before they could see each other in person.\n\nThey announced plans to tie the knot in April, but the prosecutor in the case refused to sign off on the wedding plans, according to a memo from the local sheriff's office.\n\nA judge then reversed the decision to ban the pair from getting married and now Jenai, 48, says they'll likely get married this month, according to Page Six.\n\nCrossFit co-founder Lauren Jenai, 48, may finally tie the knot with her accused murderer boyfriend Franklin Tyrone Tucker this month after a judge reversed a prior decision to ban them from getting married\n\nThe wedding will likely take place at Monroe County Detention Center in Key West Florida where Tucker is being held\n\nThe judge's decision comes after Tucker recently filed a motion to remove the prosecutor in the case, alleging she has a conflict with one of his defense lawyers.\n\nTheir jailhouse wedding would be the place where Jenai and Tucker share their first kiss - in fact, it'll be the first physical contact they'll share in 30 years.\n\n'Isn\u2019t that a little bit romantic?' she said to the outlet. 'Today I was called by the chaplain of the jail \u2026 One of the next steps in the process according to Florida law is we have to go to a marriage counseling class.'\n\nJenai is worth some $20million and has four children - aged 10 to 13. They all live in an idyllic $800,000, 5-bedroom house, a couple of blocks from Mt. Tabor Park in Portland, Oregon.\n\nShe made her fortune from her part in building the CrossFit exercise regime and then divorcing the company's co-founder, Greg Glassman, in a long, messy process that stretched from 2009 to 2013.\n\nJenai, who was previously married to CrossFit co-founder and CEO Greg Glassman, met Tucker back in high school but they reconnected as adults on Facebook before he was arrested for murder\n\nTucker has been in jail since 2017 and faces a first-degree murder charge as well as two counts of strongarm robbery\n\nJenai insists Tucker is innocent and tells DailyMailTV they reconnected before his arrest but fell in love through these love letters and artwork he sent her from prison\n\nDespite Tucker being behind bars for two years, the two fell in love through video visitations, until Jenai got 'a little risque' and flashed one of her breasts, and they were suspended from further video calls.\n\nThe two will tie the knot at Monroe County Detention Center in Key West, Florida, where tucker is being held.\n\nShe says after the nuptials in jail she'll have to leave on her own but she says she'll celebrate the wedding with friends and family.\n\n'That\u2019s gonna be horrible. I know how hard that\u2019s going to be,' Jenai said.\n\nAs for their future, it's unlikely the pair will be able to enjoy conjugal visits.\n\nJenai is worth some $20million and lives in Oregon with her four children. She made her fortune from her part in building the CrossFit exercise regime and then divorcing the company's co-founder, Greg Glassman (above)\n\nThe couple had crushes on each other in high school but haven't met face-to-face in 30 years, only communicating through video chat, phone and letters. Jenai is pictured in this dated photo\n\nTucker pictured above as a teen, around the time that he knew Jenai\n\n'Conjugal visits - I assume this is never going to happen,' she said.\n\nA lawyer representing the couple said that they 'should be granted conjugal visits after their marriage because of the length of time he\u2019s been held behind bars' with no bond.\n\nAs for Tucker, if convicted in the Treehouse murder, he could face life in jail.\n\nIn the murder Matthew Bonnett, 59, was stabbed to death on the evening of November 17, 2017, after he went to check on his neighbor Paula Belmonte who lived in a ramshackle tree house on Florida\u2019s Stock Island, immediately east of Key West.\n\nPolice allege that when Bonnet arrived on the scene, Tucker and co-defendant Rory Wilson were in the process of robbing Belmonte at knifepoint as they searched for crack cocaine.\n\nWilson sliced Belmonte\u2019s neck, prosecutors say, and as the pair left they encountered Bonnet. Wilson claims Tucker attacked Bonnet with a knife. Bonnet died in hospital several hours later from five stab wounds.\n\nTucker \u2014 inmate number 16MNI021983 \u2014 has been in the Monroe County Detention Center ever since. As well as the first-degree murder charge, he faces two counts of strongarm robbery, one of tampering with a witness, two of committing a felony while wearing a hood, three of using a deadly weapon and one of violating probation.", "description": "CrossFit co-founder Lauren Jenai, 48, says she'll marry her accused murderer boyfriend\u00a0Franklin Tyrone Tucker, 47, this month in Florida jail.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19446556-0-image-a-20_1570545107764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
