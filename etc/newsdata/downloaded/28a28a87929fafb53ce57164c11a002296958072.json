(Vincent Yu/AP)\n\nApple Inc. removed a mapping app that allowed users to track the whereabouts of police in protest-wracked Hong Kong after Chinese state media accused the U.S. tech giant of enabling unrest in the city by permitting downloads of the \u201cpoisonous\u201d app.\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Apple said it took down HKmap.live because it had learned from Hong Kong authorities that the app had been used to \u201ctarget and ambush police\u201d and threaten public safety, adding that the program violated its rules.\n\nIt was Apple\u2019s second reversal on HKmap.live, which it initially rejected and then allowed to appear on its App Store. The latest about-face came after the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, said in a blog post this week that the app had \u201cbetrayed the feelings of the Chinese people.\u201d The article accused the app\u2019s anonymous developer of harboring malicious motives and queried whether Apple was an accomplice of \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed authorities have intensified a crackdown on demonstrators, who have taken to the streets to push for democracy and to oppose Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the semiautonomous financial hub. The unrest has become increasingly violent in recent weeks, posing the most direct challenge to the rule of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n[Response to NBA executive\u2019s Hong Kong tweet shows the rift between China and U.S.]\n\nApple\u2019s backdown comes as U.S. businesses find themselves under pressure from China\u2019s government over actions or statements perceived as contrary to the narrative of the ruling Communist Party. The pressure is particularly acute when it involves sensitive political issues such as Hong Kong.\n\nIn recent days, the NBA found itself the target of a furious nationalist backlash from Beijing after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters. Blizzard Entertainment, meanwhile, suspended a professional gamer for a year for reportedly shouting \u201cLiberate Hong Kong!\u201d during an interview. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns a 5 percent stake in Blizzard\u2019s parent company, Activision Blizzard.\n\nThe tension has highlighted some U.S. firms\u2019 dependence on China while raising questions about their willingness to compromise on values such as freedom of expression to continue doing business in the country, where authorities tolerate no criticism of the ruling party. The experience has also shown the Chinese government\u2019s preparedness to punish foreign companies that don\u2019t toe its line.\n\n[From Shake Shack to Starbucks, the Hong Kong-China standoff is proving bad for business]\n\nIn Hong Kong, other U.S. companies have found themselves on the opposite side of the coin. Starbucks outlets have been targeted by pro-democracy demonstrators because the Seattle-based chain\u2019s local franchisee, Maxim\u2019s, is seen as backing the Chinese government\u2019s stance against the protests.\n\nHong Kong police didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment on Thursday about their purported role in the HKmap.live app\u2019s removal.\n\nThe app used crowdsourced information to publicize the locations of riot police, traffic disruptions, deployment of tear gas and other incidents related to the protests.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter on Thursday, the app\u2019s developer said there was zero evidence that it had been used to target police or threaten public safety. It stressed that moderators deleted comments that encouraged criminal activity.\n\nApple\u2019s move, it said, was \u201cclearly a political decision\u201d designed to suppress freedom and human rights in Hong Kong.\n\nShibani Mahtani contributed to this article.\n\nRead more\n\nChina lashes out at Western businesses as it tries to cut support for Hong Kong protests\n\nFrom Shake Shack to Starbucks, the Hong Kong-China standoff is proving bad for business\n\nResponse to NBA executive\u2019s Hong Kong tweet shows the rift between China and U.S.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The step followed Chinese state media accusations that the tech giant was enabling unrest in the city.", "authors": ["David Crawshaw", "Asian Politics", "Geopolitics", "Especially North", "South Korea", "Southeast Asia", "Australia", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6N2T-SbUYOGsJASlSuvVjH9jQWA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LLJ2WWHLD4I6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
