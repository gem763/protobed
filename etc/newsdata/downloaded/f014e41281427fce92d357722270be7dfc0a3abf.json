On October 12th, RSK, the project that brought smart contracts to Bitcoin, launched a new incentive program that will provide a big boost to its merged mining rewards program.\n\nRSK\u2019s reward program, which compensates merged mining efforts in RBTC, the platform\u2019s native token, increased rewards by more than 1,000%.\n\nSmart contracts have been one of the most lauded features of blockchain technology. Deloitte\u2019s 2019 Global Blockchain Survey found that 58% of today\u2019s businesses see smart contract development and implementation as highly important and an additional 37% see it as moderately important.\n\nRSK brings this functionality to businesses while developing as a sidechain to Bitcoin\u2019s famously secure and incredibly popular blockchain. The value of the platform\u2019s utility token, RBTC, is linked 1:1 to Bitcoin, and this token is used to facilitate the smart contract ecosystem.\n\nIts merge mining technique means that Bitcoin miners don\u2019t need any additional equipment or capabilities to merge mine RBTC. Simply put, Bitcoin miners can accrue fees from transactions taking place on the RSK sidechain, without expending additional effort or relying on more resources.\n\nRSK\u2019s most recent incentive program will make this process even more lucrative. Indeed, the initial plan which ran between September 1st and September 5th, showed that rewards increased by 1,000% per block, surpassing all other merged mining platforms during that period.\n\nIn total, nearly $50,000 was distributed during the first month.\n\nThe announcement was made at the Global Mining Leaders Summit, an invite-only event that brings together 300 of the industry\u2019s movers and shakers with a special emphasis on the mining space.\n\nNow, all network miners can participate in this new program, with increased rewards that are intended to spur additional mining involvement as the platform grows.\n\nAs Adrian Eidelman, RSK Chief Technology Officer, said in an October 12th statement, \u201cBringing enough rewards to miners and pools is crucial for RSK\u2019s goal of becoming the most secure smart contracts platform. As we drive adoption and increase the volume of transactions in the network, we want to be sure incentives are already enough to make it attractive for miners and pools to integrate RSK.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was just one element of the positive sentiment surrounding RSK.\n\nIOV Labs, which develops many of the popular elements for RSK\u2019s platform, recently acquired Taringa, Latin America\u2019s largest social network. Taringa intends to integrate RSK blockchain infrastructure into its platform, which boasts a user base of more than 30 million people.\n\nWhile RSK isn\u2019t the only merged mining platform compatible with Bitcoin, it already has support from three of the top Bitcoin mining pools, and its latest announcement should entice more people to participate, further bolstering its long-term capabilities.\n\nFor miners, the implications are clear. The financial prospects for merge mining are significantly improved. There is money to be made from the practice as supply and demand economics continues to drive the equation.\n\nImage by Luisella Planeta Leoni from Pixabay", "description": "If you\u2019re a Bitcoin miner or enthusiast, you now have another reason to smile.
