Since then, his administration has seemingly redefined \"religious freedom\" as a license to discriminate against Muslims, LGBTQ people and other groups. So, forgive me for my surprise when the president recently gave a speech on religious freedom, urging other nations to address religious persecution.\n\nIf Trump is serious about promoting true religious freedom worldwide, he should start with his own policies.\n\nFor instance, Trump chose Tony Perkins to chair his Commission on International Religious Freedom. Perkins has long advocated for anti-LGBTQ+ initiatives and calling for \u201creligious freedom\u201d when it favors Christians first and foremost. Perkins has used his chairmanship to champion similar policies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPerkins is not the only one in the president\u2019s close circle to share this worldview. Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PencePence open to releasing transcripts of call with Ukraine Only openly gay major league men's soccer player Collin Martin endorses Buttigieg Poll: 21 percent of GOP voters would prefer Pence as president MORE, who sat by Trump\u2019s side as he delivered his address, describes himself as \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" He repeatedly has expressed sympathy for business owners facing legal charges for violating civil rights laws, affirming their claims that religious freedom includes a license to discriminate.\n\nTrump used this opportunity to announce a new proposed coalition of business leaders, who will focus on \u201creligious freedom in the workplace.\u201d We can reasonably assume they will share Pence and Perkins\u2019 views \u2014 with $25 million of promised support. This is especially alarming as the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments in three workplace discriminations next month.\n\nThe Trump version of securing religious rights in the workplace sounds a little different from longstanding non-discrimination laws. The administration consistently pushes the view that commercial enterprises should be permitted to refuse to hire, discipline or fire employees whose lives do not conform to their boss\u2019 religious beliefs. As a result, employers of a certain faith have more rights \u2014 and power over their employees\u2019 lives \u2014 while the rest of us have less.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Trump chose to champion this cause on the international stage just one day before the historic congressional hearing on his very own Muslim ban. Even in its slightly revised form, the ban violates constitutional principles and undermines America\u2019s standing in the world. So, the president\u2019s invitation to immigrants facing religious persecution abroad strikes a discordant note for the Muslim families his own policies have kept apart, along with the immigrants at our southern border seeking safety and a new beginning.\n\nAll Americans \u2014 of any faith and of no faith \u2014 should recognize the disconnect between Trump\u2019s speech and his administration\u2019s policies. For the past several decades, the Christian conservative movement has attempted to alter the meaning of \u201creligious freedom\u201d to solely encompass the protection of one particular ideology and belief system \u2014 at the expense of everyone else. From recent pushes to limit civil liberties for LGBTQ+ Americans to a constant attack on Muslim Americans and immigrants, these efforts are only escalating.\n\nSo, what exactly will Trump\u2019s $25 million notion of \u201creligious freedom\u201d look like at home and abroad?\n\nRabbi Jack Moline is president of Interfaith Alliance.", "description": "All Americans \u2014 of any faith and of no faith \u2014 should recognize the disconnect between Trump\u2019s speech and his administration\u2019s policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as12_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
