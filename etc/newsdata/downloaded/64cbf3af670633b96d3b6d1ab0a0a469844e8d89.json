Katie Hill amid allegations of improper relationship with staffer", "language": "en", "text": "The allegations first surfaced in an article on the conservative website RedState.org. The article alleged that Hill and her husband were in a consensual three-person relationship with a woman on her campaign team. The article included text messages it said were between Hill and the woman as well as intimate photos of them together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe article also alleged that Hill was involved romantically with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, which would violate House ethics rules.\n\nHill, 31, confirmed that she was in a relationship with the female campaign staffer, according to the Los Angeles Times, but has denied that she had a romantic relationship with Kelly.\n\n\u201cAllegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false,\u201d Hill said in a statement she released Tuesday. \u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNeither Kenny Heslep, Hill\u2019s husband, nor Kelly, who is still employed by Hill\u2019s office, responded to requests for comment Wednesday. The divorce proceedings between Hill and Heslep began this summer, Los Angeles County court records show.\n\nAD\n\nHill is among the new class of freshmen who beat Republicans in 2018 to help the Democrats win back the majority. She is one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress.\n\nHill reported to Capitol Police that lewd photos of her had been published online. In a letter sent to constituents and obtained by the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, Hill called the action \u201ca crime\u201d and said \u201cthe perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe acknowledged in the letter that she did have a romantic relationship with a campaign staffer but has continued to deny the alleged affair with Kelly.\n\n\u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,\u201d the letter read, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nUnder House ethics rules adopted last year in response to high-profile sexual harassment claims involving members of Congress, it is against the official code of conduct for a member to \u201cengage in a sexual relationship with any employee\u201d who works for the member.\n\nAD\n\nThe House Ethics Committee, compromising an equal number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers, investigates possible violations by House members and offers verdicts. A House member who is found guilty of breaking House ethics rules can face myriad disciplinary actions including being stripped of committee leadership posts.\n\nAD\n\nHill is vice chair of the Oversight Committee, a rare powerful position for a freshman.\n\nThe Ethics Committee said in publicly revealing its investigation that the announcement \u201cdoes not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee. No other public comment will be made on this matter except in accordance with Committee rules.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The California Democrat has denied allegations that she was romantically involved with her legislative director.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i3ike-gqfyrGnbuOeZDZQHFoh3U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXUVELXV5EI6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
