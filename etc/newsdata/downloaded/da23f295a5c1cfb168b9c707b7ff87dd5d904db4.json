Though many prominent men who have been #MeToo-ed have discussed the ways in which they\u2019ve been negatively impacted by accusations of assault, New York\u2019s reporting finds that the trauma experienced by the people who\u2019ve come forward to report them is often ignored \u2014 some have lost their jobs, some have incurred debt, some have lost friends and family. With an introductory essay by New York writer-at-large Rebecca Traister, and reporting by senior correspondent Irin Carmon and contributor Amelia Schonbek, New York\u2019s September 30\u2013October 13, 2019, issue\u2019s cover story looks at the toll of speaking out.\n\nSchonbek and Carmon began their reporting by researching the details of dozens of cases, from the best known to the often forgotten. One by one, they contacted people who had come forward and asked whether they\u2019d be interested in talking about everything that followed their decision to speak out. \u201cIn our interviews, the stories often tumbled out quickly, as if the speakers had been waiting a long time for a journalist to ask them about something other than the details of the harassment or assault that men had inflicted on them,\u201d says Schonbek, who added that she was struck by how much of what the subjects said went against the dominant narrative of what motivates people to speak out about sexual misconduct. \u201cNone of them made the decision lightly; none of them were excited about becoming public figures,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of them said they made the decision to speak publicly only when it became clear that the story was larger than them. They spoke out not for their own sake but to try and protect future victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs journalists, we tend to congratulate ourselves for our heroic role in exposing wrongdoing \u2014 the barriers we overcame, how dogged we were in getting to the truth,\u201d adds Carmon. \u201cBut it\u2019s really the sources who put themselves on the line, who lose control over their own narrative and have to pick up the pieces of their lives after the headlines fade. That was what we wanted to get at here.\u201d", "description": "In New York Magazine\u2019s September 30\u2013October 13, 2019, issue\u2019s cover story, talking to the people who lived it on the costs of coming forward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/press/2019/09/27/Sept30-Oct13_Testimonies.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
