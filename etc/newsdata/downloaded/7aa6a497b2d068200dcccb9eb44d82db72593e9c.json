Also, the second question is one I and my colleagues get asked constantly, including within the glass walls of The Times.\n\nThe editorial board is composed of 14 writers and editors drawn from the Times Opinion department, which also includes opinion columnists, Op-Ed editors and others. The Opinion department is independent of the Times newsroom, with a separate mission but the same standards for fact. The first anyone in the newsroom learned of the board\u2019s editorial about the impeachment inquiry was when we posted it to The Times\u2019s website at 5 a.m. on Friday.\n\nThe purpose of Times Opinion is to supply the wide-ranging debate about big ideas that a diverse democracy needs. Just in the last couple of days, we\u2019ve had writers arguing against the impeachment inquiry and arguing for it. Amid that debate, the role of the editorial board is to provide Times readers with a long-range view formed not by one person\u2019s expertise and experience but ballasted by certain institutional values that have evolved across more than 150 years. That\u2019s why the editorials, unlike other articles at The Times, appear without a byline. I\u2019ve always believed that strong institutions, like strong families, are meant to transmit principles across generations; the work of The Times\u2019s editorial board has reflected the principles both of its members and of the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which has supplied the publishers who have overseen the board\u2019s work \u2014 sometimes day to day, sometimes only on the occasion of momentous news \u2014 for five generations.", "description": "And what is an editorial board anyway?", "authors": ["James Bennet"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27readersWeb/27readersWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
