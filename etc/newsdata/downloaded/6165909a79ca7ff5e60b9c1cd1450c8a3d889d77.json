Worried he couldn\u2019t compete with the plethora of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, he reversed course and made an unusual announcement.\n\nHe would not run for president.\n\nBut Steyer flipped yet again, declaring in July he would enter the race and spend at least $100 million on his presidential bid.\n\n\u201cI genuinely thought that there\u2019d be so many people running that their whole situation would be covered,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cThe reason I changed my mind was I felt as if no one was talking about the basic point in American politics, which is that the government is broken.\u201d\n\nExplore where you live.

Cory Booker wrote to supporters in a fundraising email that Steyer\u2019s \u201cability to spend millions of his personal wealth has helped him gain in the polls like no one else in this race.\u201d\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC in July that he\u2019s \u201ca bit tired of seeing billionaires trying to buy their political power.\u201d\n\nI am a bit tired of seeing billionaires trying to buy political power. pic.twitter.com/NphhRorqnu \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 9, 2019\n\nThe former hedge fund manager who has led a national effort to impeach President Donald Trump has spent millions to secure small donations and to gain traction in the polls. He\u2019s devoted nearly all of his energy thus far into the nation\u2019s four earliest voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an awful lot of people in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada who still don\u2019t know who I am,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cBut for the ones who do, I think I\u2019m saying something different. I have a very different history as an outsider and someone who built a business from scratch. There\u2019s nobody else on that stage who has the same profile that I do.\u201d\n\n\u2018My message is resonating\u2019\n\nSteyer has spent an estimated $20 million on television ads, according to FiveThirtyEight. Data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a D.C.-based communications agency tracking candidates\u2019 online spending, shows Steyer has spent $8.4 million on digital ads through Facebook and Google since he launched his campaign in July. Steyer will release his first official campaign finance report with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday.\n\nAsked if the money is what has propelled him onto the debate stage, he insisted, \u201cI\u2019m winning because my message is resonating.\u201d\n\nSteyer, who lives in San Francisco and has previously considered challenging Dianne Feinstein for senate, fell just one poll shy of meeting the Democratic National Committee\u2019s criteria for the last debate. Steyer has since steadily gained steam in the four early states, allowing him to appear on the stage Tuesday night and at the fifth presidential debate scheduled for Nov. 20.\n\nOn Monday, Steyer received 2 percent in his first national poll. By contrast, he\u2019s received as much as 4 percent support in qualifying state polls in Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina. He expects those numbers to rise as voters learn more about him.\n\nSteyer has also met the DNC\u2019s donor requirements for the next two debates by spending millions on political ads.\n\nThe nearly $30 million in advertising expenses has helped Steyer raise a total of $2 million from 166,119 donors, which exceeds the 130,000 and 165,000 individual donors the DNC has required for the October and November debates, respectively.\n\nSteyer said he has no clue how much of his personal money has already been spent and is unsure what the breakdown looks like by state. \u201cI have a very specific job in this campaign: My job is to try and talk to as many people as possible and explain what I stand for and who I am. That\u2019s my job. All the questions you are asking me are for the campaign manager, which is not my job. You can ask me those questions, and every time, I\u2019m going to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\n\nDonors give Steyer $2 million\n\nSteyer redirected specific questions to his campaign, and the campaign declined to release additional data on how much it has spent from Steyer\u2019s $100 million war chest.\n\nAlberto Lammers, a spokesman for Steyer\u2019s campaign, said the average donation size of $12 \u201cproves that his message is penetrating every level of the American electorate and that Tom is extremely effective at building grassroots movements to create progressive change.\u201d\n\nThe $12 average donation is also the smallest of the nine Democrats who have qualified for Tuesday\u2019s debate and have already released their latest quarterly campaign financial report, suggesting Steyer could be spending a lot of money on ads in order to get a lot of small-dollar contributions.\n\nSanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had the next lowest donation size, with $18 and $26, respectively. Former Vice President Joe Biden had the highest donation size at $44.\n\nThe $2 million Steyer raised between July and September represents the smallest total amount among the nine candidates who have reported their numbers. Sanders and Warren raised the most at $25.3 million and $24.6 million, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Booker ranked at the bottom with just $4.8 million and $6 million raised.\n\nSteyer\u2019s takeaway is simple: He\u2019s gained lots of ground lately but faces an uncertain future. With millions of potential voters likely to hear from him for the first time, it could mark a turning point \u2014 both for the best and the worst.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is completely in flux as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. It\u2019s completely in flux. There\u2019s going to be a lot of surprises.\u201d", "description": "Billionaire liberal activist Tom Steyer will appear at the 2020 presidential debate in Ohio.
