The family told CBS News they're pursuing a civil suit against the Trump administration, as well as Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American official who admitted to causing the car crash.\n\nHarry's stepsister, Larna Harber, explained why the family is taking it to court, a step they hoped they would never have to take, CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports.\n\n\"In simple words: get her back on the plane to the UK. Donald Trump has the authorities to do that and I can't understand why they're not,\" she said. \"She's a mom of three children \u2014 what example is this setting to her three children? \u2026 It just seems wrong. I don't understand why when something seems so simple to us.\"\n\nSacoolas' immunity is, of course, a complex issue \u2014 one that reached the highest levels of government in the U.K. and led Harry's parents all the way to the White House, where they say they were \"shocked\" when President Trump asked them to meet with Sacoolas who was in an adjoining room.\n\nThey declined that meeting, saying they would only meet with her in the U.K. and only in the presence of grief counselors. That of course still hasn't happened.\n\nThe family said it will accuse the administration of \"lawless misconduct\" and will also be seeking damages. CBS News reached out to Sacoolas' lawyers and is waiting for a reply.\n\nThis legal battle is the latest chapter in what can only be described as an extraordinary campaign led by Harry Dunn's parents. A campaign for justice that isn't over.", "description": "Harry Dunn's family wants Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American official involved in the crash, back in the U.K.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/678ac069-dc89-4465-9a29-2c4819694c24/thumbnail/1200x630/6e7d09fcdd86249090c8bb582c4eefa7/1029-ctm-dunnfamilydebrief-1960588-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
