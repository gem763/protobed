(3968.HK) said its third-quarter net profit jumped 18% from a year earlier, as both interest and fee income rose.\n\nNet profit for the third quarter was 26.63 billion yuan ($3.77 billion), compared with CNY22.62 billion in the year-ago period, the bank said.\n\nNet interest income rose 7.0% from a year ago to CNY43.82 billion, the bank said. Its net interest margin for the quarter was 2.57%, down 0.12 percentage point from the previous quarter. The decline was mainly due to still-weak credit demand from the real economy and fierce competition for deposits, the lender said.\n\nNet fee and commission income rose to CNY18.19 billion from CNY15.51 billion a year earlier, it said.\n\nWrite to Yifan Wang at yifan.wang@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 06:37 ET (10:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
