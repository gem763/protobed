Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nHow the whistleblower\u2019s complaint made it to Congress\n\nOn Thursday, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before House lawmakers about the whistleblower complaint that helped touch off an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaguire has been at the center of controversy for refusing to hand over the complaint to Congress for more than two weeks. The now-public complaint alleges that Trump used his office to solicit \u201cinterference\u201d by a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaguire sought guidance from the White House counsel and the Justice Department before turning the complaint over to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat troubled a lot of people because the White House, and specifically the president, are the subject of this whistleblower complaint,\u201d says intelligence reporter Shane Harris . \u201cSo [Rep. Adam] Schiff is asking Maguire, \u2018Why are you going to get permission on how to handle a whistleblower complaint to the person who\u2019s being complained about?\u2019 \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nOil and gas industry executives conflicted over climate change response\n\nFor years, the oil and gas industry downplayed the connection between fossil fuel burning and climate change. Today, however, nearly major fossil fuel company has acknowledged that carbon emissions help drive global warming, even as President Trump questions the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt a time when President Trump and his top deputies are moving full steam ahead with expanding fossil fuel production in the United States,\u201d says energy reporter Juliet Eilperin , \u201cyou have oil and gas industry officials themselves trying to adopt a more nuanced approach.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Post obtained a recording from a meeting of the Independent Petroleum Association of America in which key players in the fossil fuel industry debate over how to address climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn one level, they feel like they need to acknowledge that their operations are helping fuel climate change,\u201d Eilperin says, \u201cin part because they don\u2019t want policies that are so out of sync with the science that they\u2019re going to be rejected by the courts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Rabbis have to weigh in: Is this what God intended?\u2019\n\nDietary restrictions are woven into many religious texts. The Old and New testaments, the Koran and the Vedas all feature rules that may soon be muddled by food company Tyson, which has invested in the development of a plant-based shrimp alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of my editors said, \u2018By the way \u2014 is it kosher?\u2019 \u201d says food reporter Laura Reiley . \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered that element of it, that religious doctrine has to deal with this raft of new food technology.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Shane Harris takes us through the newly released whistleblower complaint.
