Rather than being able to focus solely on how to improve on a debut season that brought a French league title, a cup final and an infuriating last-16 exit to Manchester United in the Champions League, the Paris Saint-Germain manager was fielding questions about the future of Neymar.\n\nOn and on it went. From the moment the first reports of Neymar wanting to leave appeared, through to the moment he did not return for the first day of pre-season to finally playing his first club game of the season on 14 September, the story was always about the Brazilian rather than the team.\n\nNot that Tuchel was surprised. He knows what it entails being the manager of PSG and is not complaining. The Neymar saga may have overshadowed the start of the season but PSG are top of Ligue 1 by two points and lead their Champions League group after two wins in two games, including a 3-0 victory over Real Madrid. Tuchel can be happy when they are 11 games into the season and there are signs the relationship between Neymar and the fans is slowly healing.\n\nWhat next for Neymar and PSG? Read more\n\n\u201cThe supporters have expressed their opinions and I can understand them, absolutely. It\u2019s their right to express themselves,\u201d he says as we sit down for our interview as part of my work for beIN Sports France. \u201cThey\u2019re proud of their club and it\u2019s not so nice when you hear your player talking for weeks and weeks saying he wants to leave. As I told Neymar, sometimes it\u2019s like this in life \u2013 you have to face the truth and deal with the consequences.\u201d\n\nOnce the transfer window closed with Neymar still at PSG, the manager\u2019s job was to reintegrate and remotivate a player for whom he has great affection. \u201cNeymar has a good heart,\u201d Tuchel says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a bit hard to see that he is a nice person when you only watch him play from outside. But he is, he\u2019s a nice guy.\n\n\u201cI told him: \u2018You think the hardest part is over but from now on you have to deal with me and I\u2019m going to push you hard. So the hardest thing is still to come for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nTuchel\u2019s pushing seems to be working. Neymar has scored winning goals for PSG against Strasbourg and Lyon, with further strikes against Bordeaux and Angers, although he was ruled out for four weeks with a hamstring injury on Monday. Bigger tests await for Tuchel, with the Champions League last 16 looming in February as a make-or-break moment once again for a PSG manager. I ask him how he measures success at a club such as his. Is it simply a question of points or is there something more to it?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thomas Tuchel replaced Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund before moving to PSG in May 2018.

But there\u2019s also the relationships with the players, the connection with the players, sometimes helping a player through a difficult period in his career. That\u2019s also success, no? Hopefully I don\u2019t depend too much on the points and the titles because the possibility that you get sad or that you don\u2019t fulfil your own goals is too high. There\u2019s more to life than points and trophies but we\u2019re all very competitive and we all want to win every game.\n\n\u201cSometimes you work hard helping players through tough times and you work hard in building a team and creating connections and then you see your team work so well together in a really tight match and you think, \u2018Wow, what a great job we did over the past however many weeks.\u2019 But nobody out there knows what you\u2019ve really achieved. All the little things you achieve every day are like little rewards for me. From the outside it\u2019s all much simpler and it\u2019s just about winning.\u201d\n\nThe German arrived at PSG in 2018 after two seasons at Borussia Dortmund followed by a year\u2019s sabbatical. In the French capital he has won the league but that is expected at a club who have Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Neymar and Edinson Cavani in the forward line. Tuchel has a remarkable squad at his disposal but when asked whether he has ever experienced a perfect game, he says: \u201cNever had one, never been close and still on the hunt. Still looking for one and still loving the training and still looking for the perfect training session, too. I like to think we get closer and closer all the time.\n\n\u201cYou have these periods where you really think, \u2018Yes, this is it\u2019 but the tension is so high in these games that you cannot fully enjoy it. Football is a game where lots of mistakes happen and the ability to deal with the mistakes is also a quality. You have to accept as a coach that there will not be a perfect game. It is sad, of course. It\u2019s a bit like Sisyphus, isn\u2019t it? You never quite get there.\n\n\u201cOur recent game against Real Madrid makes you very happy as a coach, of course. Winning big games can bring a lot of satisfaction, like winning at Old Trafford last season and beating Liverpool at home. You have amazing feelings and you love this job because you see so many good things. It can get close to perfection but never quite attain it.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIn the meantime Tuchel, who speaks fluent English and gets by pretty well in French, will continue his quest to become better acquainted with the city of Paris. A family man with two young daughters (who, he says with a laugh, only recently discovered there could be other things on the television screen at home than football matches), Tuchel would like to have more time and freedom for cultural pursuits. He is still coming to terms with a profile that often means he will be recognised, even in Paris museums.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same looking at a painting in a gallery when you can feel other eyes are on you,\u201d he shrugs and admits to toying with the idea of adopting a disguise. \u201cSometimes I try to sneak out when it\u2019s dark, out in the streets, to get a taste of that freedom, to feel the vibe of the city. Other times I care less about people watching me and just go to a restaurant but that doesn\u2019t happen that often. It\u2019s an all-consuming job, hard to escape from and you don\u2019t know the price you have to pay for your passion when you start out.\u201d\n\nPSG travel to Nice on Friday night and then take on Club Brugge in the Champions League next Tuesday. Then it is Marseille on Sunday night. It is a relentless business and for someone who has been a manager for 19 years it is a demanding job that can seem never-ending.\n\nDoes a person have to be slightly mad to be a manager? \u201cYes, you have to be,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cIt was pretty obvious from the start because even when you\u2019re the coach of the under-14s or the under-15s in the academy, although you don\u2019t have to deal with the press or the media you do have to deal with the parents and sometimes I\u2019m not sure which is worse \u2026\n\n\u201cYou have to deal with the pressure inside the academies, the parents who want the best for their kids and how you don\u2019t always share the same opinions. But we\u2019re all crazy in love with football so we accept it.\u201d", "description": "The PSG manager talks to Darren Tulett about the Brazilian star, what constitutes success and why \u2018you never quite get there\u2019 chasing the perfect game", "authors": ["Darren Tulett In Paris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca8e137716944d8ceba4c9eb6567ac0feda75781/341_273_4970_2982/master/4970.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4554b01d3fdb82d9bfebb3b1eaf0342", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
