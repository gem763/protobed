And now they want to bring him down.\n\nSoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s sudden turn against WeWork CEO Adam Neumann highlights how the Japanese conglomerate has wielded far more dollars than sense in its investment strategy. Officials tied to SoftBank want Neumann to step down as CEO, according to reports over the weekend.\n\nSoftBank and its Vision Fund are WeWork\u2019s biggest investors, with a stake of around 29% in We Co., the company\u2019s official name. That support is a key reason why this real-estate rental company fetched a $47 billion valuation.\n\nTo SoftBank, WeWork was a unicorn on the rise. Its corporate peccadilloes, which largely revolve around corporate governance, appear to have been ignored by executives at the Japanese company: WeWork was a unicorn and SoftBank just had to be part of it. So SoftBank kept pouring in more money, just as it did with other great startups like Uber Technologies Inc., Didi Chuxing and Slack Technologies Inc. At one point SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son described WeWork as the next Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in reference to the fortune he made from investing in Jack Ma\u2019s Chinese e-commerce giant.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until WeWork filed its IPO prospectus in August that the rest of the world saw in clear daylight what SoftBank\u2019s common sense-radar had failed to detect when it signed each check. As my colleague Shira Ovide wrote at the time, the list of \u201ctransactions involving a company\u2019s CEO or other insiders is astonishing for WeWork.\u201d\n\nAmong them: Neumann\u2019s wife is one of two or three people who get to choose a successor if he is incapacitated; the CEO owns stakes in some of the office buildings that WeWork leases; and at least two members of Neumann\u2019s family did work for the company\u2019s Creator Awards, which its biggest outside shareholder committed $180 million to fund.\n\nThat outside shareholder is none other than SoftBank \u2013 a stark reminder that Masayoshi Son and his team not only knew of these dealings, it actively enabled them.\n\nBecause these red flags have spooked other investors, WeWork is looking more like it\u2019ll fetch $15 billion when it eventually lists. So now SoftBank cares, to the tune of a $9 billion lower value on its stake. It\u2019s too late to exit WeWork. But it\u2019s not too late to exit Neumann.\n\nComparisons to Uber are inevitable. Co-founder Travis Kalanick faced numerous complaints about his erratic management style and questionable judgment. SoftBank\u2019s entry into into the ride-hailing giant\u2019s capitalization table was part of the solution to a problem. Son bought out a lot of Kalanick\u2019s stake, giving other shareholders and board members leverage to push out the CEO and replace him.\n\nIn WeWork\u2019s case, it may be that Son himself is wielding the cutlass. According to CNBC, his maneuver is seen by some as part of an effort to stop a planned IPO altogether. Last week I discussed why halting the IPO might be good for SoftBank.\n\nJust as a new CEO helped revive sentiment toward Uber, and prepare it for a successful IPO, Son is likely betting that simply getting rid of Neumann and pretending that will fix things should be enough to juice the valuation when a listing does eventually happen. And should installing a new CEO result in, say, a $25 billion valuation instead of $15 billion, then that would be a $3 billion win for SoftBank.\n\nYet this recent maneuvering by SoftBank suggests the concern isn\u2019t WeWork\u2019s funky corporate structure, but that public-market investors don\u2019t like this funky corporate structure. It\u2019s like a kid not being sorry for dipping his hand in the cookie jar, but for getting caught.\n\nIt tells us also that SoftBank is tone deaf. WeWork\u2019s structure should have raised red flags even before it decided to pump billions into the company. It could have gone straight to Neumann and the existing board and pushed for change, because that\u2019s the kind of power a big stack bully with a $100 billion checkbook wields.\n\nInstead, it looks like SoftBank\u2019s biggest concern was the Vision Fund\u2019s much-vaunted internal rate of return.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible this WeWork saga will be a wake-up call to SoftBank. Maybe now they\u2019ll be clear-sighted enough to spot landmines before they hit them \u2013 instead of boldly barreling down the unicorn highway in the belief that speed negates any need for caution.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- They built him up.
