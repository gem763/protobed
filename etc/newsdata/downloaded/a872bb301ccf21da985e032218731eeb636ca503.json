The tool is based on futures pricing from live markets and reflects the views of traders placing real bets on the CME exchange.\n\nThe services sector grew at a considerably slower pace than expected in September with the ISM nonmanufacturing index posting its the weakest reading since August 2016. The stock market sold off sharply on the data.\n\n\"My bottom line is that the weakness in manufacturing has now infected the services side of the U.S. economy which makes up about 80% of it,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.", "description": "A rate cut by the Fed later this month seems almost a done deal to traders after disappointing services reading fueled recession fears.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136943-1568832928750gettyimages-1169219362.jpg?v=1568833022"}
