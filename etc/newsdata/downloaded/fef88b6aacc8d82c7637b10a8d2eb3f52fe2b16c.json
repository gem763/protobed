We live with that fear every day.\n\n\"I feel like we\u2019re going backwards in society with our attitudes. People who say, 'Gay Pride? Why isn\u2019t there a Straight Pride?' I\u2019ll tell you why, because you don\u2019t need it.\n\n\"Because luckily for you, you\u2019re able to be affectionate with your partner in public and you won\u2019t be abused for it. It\u2019s absolutely vile what goes on.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
