Hundreds \u2013 many furious, many elderly \u2013 have contacted The Mail on Sunday demanding that regulatory action be taken against him \u2013 and other companies involved in the debacle.\n\nNursing considerable losses and unable to access the money tied up in the Equity Income and Income Focus funds, they demand that:\n\nWoodford must be made to return the \u00a38.7m of fees he earned from Equity Income, say investors\n\nWoodford must be made to return the \u00a38.7million of fees he earned from Equity Income after dealings in it were suspended in June, when he was unable to raise enough cash to meet a wave of redemptions amid mounting concerns over the fund\u2019s performance.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) must hold Woodford to account for mismanaging his flagship Equity Income fund \u2013 and take punitive action (some want him banned from the City). Investors are furious he has been allowed to step away from the wreckage of his operation \u2013 Woodford Investment Management \u2013 with just an apology and nothing by way of explanation.\n\nThe fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown must be disciplined by the FCA for relentlessly billing Equity Income and Income Focus as \u2018best\u2019 buys \u2013 up until Equity Income was \u2018gated\u2019 on June 3.\n\nOther firms involved in the demise of Woodford \u2013 namely fund overseers Link and Northern Trust \u2013 should face close regulatory scrutiny for their failure to protect investors\u2019 interests by allowing Woodford to consistently break fund rules.\n\nLawyers must take up cudgels on behalf of investors and mount legal claims against Woodford and Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThe regulator must clamp down on fund labels that are misleading. For example, where a fund suggests a focus on producing an income for investors when it is in fact heavily invested in illiquid or unquoted stocks that do not generate income (as was the case for Woodford Equity Income).\n\nThe regulator itself should be overhauled so it is ready to detect potential problems.\n\nThe rage of investors cannot be underestimated. They feel let down by a regulatory system that continues to fail to protect the consumer.\n\nINVESTORS LOSE HALF THEIR MONEY\n\nUnderstandably, the butt of most investors\u2019 anger is Neil Woodford. The 59-year-old jumped ship from asset manager Invesco Perpetual in 2013 to go it alone, setting up Woodford Investment Management and launching three investment funds \u2013 vehicles that have proved disastrous investments.\n\nEquity Income, his highest profile fund, was launched in June 2014. It is now being dismantled, with investors likely to start receiving the first of a series of cash payments early next year. Depending on when they bought into the fund, investors could be left nursing losses of 50 per cent or more.\n\nYour fury at fallen star We need to make an example of Woodford to stop irresponsible management by fund managers who care more about their fees than the financial wellbeing of investors. Andy Sutcliffe, Nottingham I invested in Equity Income through a Lifetime Isa. The money was intended for my 22-year-old daughter to use as a deposit on her first home. That\u2019s not now possible. David Hughes, Selby, North Yorkshire Woodford should flog a few of the horses he owns to pay us back the money we have lost. Nigel Bennett, Cobham, Surrey I was hoodwinked. He should be forced to return the money Chris Button, 77, Suffolk I feel that Hargreaves Lansdown has failed investors like me Geoff Ranger, 74, Hampshire\n\nDealings in Income Focus are suspended as its future is debated \u2013 the fund\u2019s share price is down 25 per cent since launch in March 2017. A statement is likely early next week, which could see a new investment manager appointed, or the fund wound up like Equity Income.\n\nThree days ago, the board of the third vehicle, Woodford Patient Capital, announced that asset manager Schroders would be taking over management of the investment trust. This triggered a mini-revival in the trust\u2019s share price, though it is still 60 per cent below its \u00a31 launch price in April 2015.\n\n\u2018Woodford acted immorally in raiding Equity Income for \u00a38.7million of management fees after the fund was shut,\u2019 says retired veterinary surgeon Chris Button, from Lowestoft, Suffolk. \u2018He should be forced to return the money and held to account.\u2019\n\nChris, 77, invested a five-figure sum in Equity Income and says he was \u2018hoodwinked\u2019 by its income label. He says: \u2018I never thought for a moment I would be exposing my retirement investments to a fund with significant holdings in risky unquoted firms. If I had known, I would have left well alone. I expected an emphasis on income. It wasn\u2019t delivered.\u2019\n\nMichael Collins, 67, from South Bedfordshire, also says Woodford should be made to return fees levied after Equity Income was shut. Michael and his partner have a five-figure sum tied up in the fund.\n\n\u2018I followed Neil Woodford at Invesco Perpetual in the 1990s and 2000s and was impressed with his strategy of investing in big, undervalued companies,\u2019 he says. \u2018I assumed he would do more of the same when he set up Woodford Investment Management, which is why I invested in Equity Income at launch in June 2014. But he changed tack and I\u2019ve lost out as a result.\u2019\n\nHe adds: \u2018Of course I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m not a gambler and hold a broad spectrum of funds, invested in the UK and globally. Yet Woodford, by investing in unquoted firms, gambled with my precious money as if choosing between red and black on the roulette wheel.\u2019\n\nJohn Astall, a retired accountant from Warrington, Cheshire, accuses Woodford of taking Equity Income investors like him for an \u2018\u00a38.7 million ride\u2019 while depleting the value of their retirement funds.\n\nAvril Robertson, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, says Woodford behaved in an \u2018unscrupulous manner and deserves no sympathy from anyone\u2019 while Gillian De Maine, 81, from Christchurch, Dorset, says Woodford should be brought to book for \u2018misnaming and mismanaging\u2019 a fund \u2013 Equity Income \u2013 that had more of an \u2018emphasis on illiquid stocks than income generation\u2019. She also wants Woodford to repay the fees.\n\nCOULD HARGREAVES LANSDOWN BE SUED?\n\nFund platform Hargreaves Lansdown is much criticised for tirelessly promoting Equity Income \u2013 from before the fund\u2019s launch in June 2014 right up to when it was suspended on June 3 this year.\n\nThough Hargreaves Lansdown did alert clients to Equity Income\u2019s increased exposure to risky, illiquid stocks in December 2017, March 2018 and January this year, it chose to keep the fund on its \u2018wealth\u2019 list of best buys. This was even though, early this year, it cut the number of funds listed on this powerful sales tool from 150 to 50.\n\nFund platform Hargreaves Lansdown is much criticised for tirelessly promoting Equity Income\n\nSome law firms are now assessing whether a class action could be brought against Hargreaves Lansdown on grounds of misrepresenting the true financial health of Equity Income to investors.\n\nLaw firm Leigh Day has already received a hundred \u2018enquiries\u2019 from customers of Hargreaves Lansdown asking about whether such a class action is feasible. Kam Vojdani, a solicitor at the firm, says it will decide on the merits of such an action \u2018fairly soon\u2019. If it goes ahead, the claim will be set up on a \u2018no win, no fee\u2019 basis, with the firm taking a slice of any compensation it wins. Leigh Day would probably battle for investors to be returned to a position of \u2018no loss\u2019.\n\nRetired Crown Court judge John Machin says such a class action \u2018could succeed\u2019. The 77-year-old, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, and his wife Susan invested a combined \u00a350,000 across Equity Income and Income Focus.\n\nHe says: \u2018The fact that Hargreaves Lansdown kept telling customers that Woodford was a top fund manager, and continued to recommend Equity Income even though the fund\u2019s portfolio was getting riskier is an indication of possible negligence.\u2019\n\nThough many readers support the idea of a similar class action against Woodford for mismanaging Equity Income, John believes its chances of success are less. He says: \u2018Woodford has the defence that had he been allowed to continue managing Equity Income, he may have turned around the fund\u2019s fortunes.\u2019\n\nRetired optician Geoff Ranger, 74, from Southampton, supports a class action against Hargreaves Lansdown. He believes the firm has been \u2018negligent\u2019.\n\nGeoff says: \u2018I talked to Hargreaves Lansdown earlier this year and expressed my concern that Equity Income was included in its new Wealth 50 best-buy list despite performing so badly. I was assured all was well. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the case. They made a massive call and got it wrong. Yes, we all make mistakes but I feel Hargreaves Lansdown has failed investors like me.\u2019\n\nGeoff is also exposed to Equity Income through a holding in one of Hargreaves\u2019 \u2018multi-manager\u2019 funds \u2013 designed to offer exposure to the country\u2019s best managers under the umbrella of a single fund.\n\nSix of these multi-manager funds have stakes in Equity Income, with three listing it as a top ten holding. Geoff\u2019s fear \u2013 shared by many \u2013 is that as investors flee these multi-manager funds, the relative exposure to Equity Income will increase, leaving remaining investors at a disadvantage.\n\nOn Friday, Hargreaves Lansdown downplayed this concern, stating the multi-manager funds were highly liquid, well diversified portfolios. On Multi-Manager Income & Growth, for example, it said Equity Income now represented 11 per cent of the total fund compared with 12.8 per cent back in June, when the Woodford fund was suspended. It refused to comment on the possibility of class actions being mounted against it.\n\nThose interested in being part of a class action against Hargreaves Lansdown should visit the website leighday.co.uk/hargreaves.\n\nREGULATOR SHOULD NOT GO UNPUNISHED\n\nFinally, many investors accuse the City regulator \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 of not acting quickly enough to lance the Woodford boil and protect investors.\n\nPhil Lynes, a retired fireman from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, says the regulator \u2018sat on the fence\u2019 for too long, allowing the problems at Equity Income to grow. He invested \u00a319,000 in Equity Income \u2013 via Hargreaves Lansdown \u2013 and says he has now put on hold some retirement plans while waiting to see how much money he gets back.\n\nHave your say on the Woodford debacle. Email: jeff.prestridge@mailonsunday.co.uk\n\nPhil, 64, adds: \u2018I feel let down by the financial services industry and regulator. We need a fit-for-purpose regulator that can restore people\u2019s confidence in savings and investments. Ineptitude and bad practice should not go unpunished.\u2019\n\nOn Friday the regulator refused to comment on whether it had dealt effectively with the Woodford case. Instead, it pointed to a letter it sent to the Treasury Select Committee in June, outlining its monitoring of Equity Income since February 2018. It did confirm ongoing investigations into Woodford, Link (an overseer of Equity Income) and the use of best-buy lists by fund platforms like Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nOn Woodford\u2019s receipt of \u00a38.7million of fees after Equity Income\u2019s suspension, it said decisions on fee structures are for the fund manager to take.\n\nAdditional reporting: Toby Walne", "description": "Many investors caught up in the Neil Woodford scandal have contacted us demanding that regulatory action be taken against him - and other companies involved in the debacle.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
