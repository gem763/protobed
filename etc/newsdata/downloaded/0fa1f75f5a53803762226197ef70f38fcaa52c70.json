Today the PM is expected to try to win parliamentary backing for his deal in a straight yes or no vote in the Commons, in the hope that MPs will sign off on the withdrawal agreement before there is the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. But Labour has another plan: overnight it declared that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP for amendments that would force Johnson to drop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit. Some of what happens today will hinge on whether the Speaker, John Bercow, will allow another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, because Johnson tried and failed to get it done on Saturday. No 10 will resist any amendments to the Brexit legislation, arguing that the current offer from the EU is the only one on the table and that \u201cwrecking amendments\u201d could torpedo the fragile coalition that it is trying to assemble for a deal.\n\nOur guide to what next for Brexit sets out the potential paths ahead. The PM claims he has the numbers to get his way, including all of his 287 voting MPs (including his brother Jo), about 20 former Tories who left the party or had the whip suspended, and about eight Labour MPs. You can read the papers\u2019 opposing stances on Brexit here, but it\u2019s a brave person who would predict with any certainty exactly what may happen over the next few days.\n\nAir pollution \u2013 Scores of people are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, including for heart attacks and strokes. Data from the King\u2019s College London study, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain on the NHS on those days, including 120 more cardiac arrests, 230 more strokes and 200 more people needing asthma treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency,\u201d said the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens. Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.\n\nChristmas recycling \u2013 John Lewis and Waitrose are to stop selling crackers containing plastic toys and puzzles as part of a drive to reduce single-use plastics \u2013 but not until 2020. Today they will announce a switch to recyclable materials such as metal and paper. John Lewis has also joined the wider crackdown on glitter (some of which contain microplastics) by reducing the amount used to decorate its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags and tags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds.\n\nNorthern Ireland abortion rights protest \u2013Members of mothballed Stormont assembly are due to return to the chamber today for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The DUP and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a largely symbolic recall of the assembly. The region\u2019s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight tonight after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.\n\nRenewable expansion \u2013 Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency has found solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 the world\u2019s solar capacity could have grown by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. The cost of solar power is also expected to decline by a further 15% by 2024.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t be a dick\u2019 \u2013 Hillary Clinton has been trolling Donald Trump, tweeting a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev, which was intended to ridicule a real letter from Trump to the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, revealed publicly last week. \u201cFound in the archives,\u201d Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d the \u201cletter\u201d began, \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, OK? Get your missiles out of Cuba \u2026 if you don\u2019t everyone will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion\u2019\u201d. Trump\u2019s letter to Erdo\u011fan, in which he urged the authoritarian Turkish president who has invaded northern Syria \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d, met with widespread disbelief, not least for its strikingly unpresidential tone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hillary Clinton\u2019s mock letter trolled Trump\u2019s letter to the Turkish president about his country\u2019s action against the Syrian Kurds.

But his new autobiography, Who am I, Again? is also about bearing witness to the time of his early years in Dudley. \u201cI grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan \u2018If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour\u2019,\u201d he tells Lanre Bakare, referring to Peter Griffiths\u2019s notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henry, aged 16, with his mother in January 1975, just after his TV debut. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images\n\nThe book ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984. To write it, Henry opened up a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d of memories and then started, as he puts it, \u201cto vomit out the chapters\u201d. He turned violence at home into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy his mother (who died in 1998) a home. He used his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies and honed his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men\u2019s clubs. At 61, and arguably Britain\u2019s best known comic, Henry continues to push back against racism: \u201cWhen, in 100 years\u2019 time, we look back at the way things change, we\u2019ll go: \u2018Wow, that was a snap of a finger.\u2019 But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, change is long. And I think that\u2019s the problem. Things aren\u2019t happening fast enough.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nWales refused to buckle under intense pressure in their Rugby World Cup win over France, which bodes well for their next outing against South Africa, who ended Japan\u2019s campaign after grinding down the host nation in the other quarter-final. Eddie Jones has told England they stand on the brink of greatness after setting up a semi-final against the \u201cbeatable\u201d All Blacks on Saturday. Winger Jack Nowell is expected to be fit and available for selection for the game in Yokohama. J\u00fcrgen Klopp railed at the VAR outcome over a \u201cclear foul\u201d in the buildup to Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal as Liverpool surrendered their 100% record in a 1-1 draw at Manchester United. Pep Guardiola has claimed Manchester City are \u201cstill not ready\u201d to win the Champions League because they are not clinical enough in front of goal. Katie Zelem and Jess Sigsworth fired United to a League Cup win over City in a Manchester derby. A tearful Andy Murray defeated Stan Wawrinka in three sets to lift the European Open in Antwerp, his first singles title since March 2017. And the ECB\u2019s Hundred has taken its first steps in an engaging piece of contrived TV theatre when eight franchises handed out playing contracts.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has warned the world economy is sleeping walking into a new financial crisis that will have devastating consequences for the democratic market system. Lord King, who was in charge at Threadneedle Street during the near-death of the global banking system and deep economic slump a decade ago, said the resistance to new thinking meant a repeat of the chaos of the 2008-09 period was looming. Giving a lecture in Washington at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, King said there had been no fundamental questioning of the ideas that led to the crisis of a decade ago. \u201cAnother economic and financial crisis would be devastating to the legitimacy of a democratic market system,\u201d he said. \u201cBy sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis.\u201d\n\nContinuing uncertainty over Brexit has pushed the pound down from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro. It\u2019s buying $1.291 and \u20ac1.157.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nThe papers almost all focus on the prospect of a new vote on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal today. The FT reports that things are looking fairly sunny for the prime minister: \u201cJohnson sticks to Brexit deal as faith rises in Westminster victory\u201d. The Guardian reports: \u201cLabour seeks new alliance to kill off PM\u2019s Brexit deal\u201d, the i has: \u201cLabour to back deal ... if second referendum included\u201d.\n\nOther papers are livid at Labour\u2019s talk of amendments, like the Daily Mail, which reports on \u201cFury at Labour plot to wreck Brexit\u201d. The Express channels some of this fury: \u201cHow dare they! New plot to hijack Brexit\u201d. The Times reports: \u201cDowning St says Labour is trying to stop Brexit\u201d, and the Telegraph says \u201cPM faces \u2018guerrilla war\u2019 over new vote on deal\u201d.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s lead story is \u201cBad blood brothers\u201d, about comments made by Prince Harry that he and his brother are \u201con different paths\u201d and the Mirror leads on an investigation into working conditions at Amazon\u2019s biggest UK warehouse: \u201cTreated like slaves\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
