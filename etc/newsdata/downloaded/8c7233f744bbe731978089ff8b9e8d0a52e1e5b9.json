REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nMohammad bin Salman told CBS program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that as de facto Saudi leader he ultimately bore \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the killing a year ago, but he denied ordering it. He made similar remarks to U.S. broadcaster PBS.\n\nAsked how he did not know about the killing by Saudi officials, he told CBS it was impossible for him to know \u201cwhat three million people working for the Saudi government do daily\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Agnes Callamard, U.N. expert on summary executions, attributed his remarks to a \u201cstrategy of rehabilitation in the face of public outrage around the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is creating a distance between himself, he is exonerating himself from direct criminal responsibility in the killing. He is creating layers, and layers and layers of actors and institutions which are protecting him from his direct accountability for the killing.\u201d\n\nShe spoke before joining Khashoggi\u2019s family and friends in Istanbul on Wednesday to mark the murder\u2019s first anniversary.\n\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the crown prince, was murdered on Oct 2 at its consulate in Istanbul. His dismembered body has never been found. A global outcry ensued and led to U.S. Treasury sanctions on 17 Saudi individuals and a Senate resolution blaming Prince Mohammed.\n\nSaudi officials have denied suspicions in the CIA that the crown prince, known as MbS, ordered the killing. Eleven people are on trial in Saudi Arabia, although Callmard has voiced concerns over a potential miscarriage of justice.\n\nIMPUNITY\n\nA report by Callamard in June found credible evidence warranting further investigation that the crown prince and other senior officials including key adviser Saud al-Qahtani are liable for the murder.\n\nCallamard told Reuters the only way she could interpret his admission of state responsibility \u2014 as opposed to personal responsibility \u2014 was as \u201crecognising implicitly at least that the killing was a state killing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the extent the killing occurred under his watch, he represents the state, he is indeed quasi head of state,\u201d she said.\n\nTurning to the international implications, Callamard said that if countries around the world did not respond properly to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, \u201cit will open the gate to a sense of impunity for the killing of independent critical voices.\u201d\n\nCallamard has called for states to widen sanctions to include the crown prince and his assets abroad unless he can prove he is not responsible.\n\nCritics of the kingdom say his latest public comments appear part of a public relations campaign ahead of Riyadh\u2019s hosting of the G20 next year, its IPO of state oil giant Saudi Aramco and a foreign investment push to diversify the economy away from oil.\n\nReacting to Prince Mohammed\u2019s description of the killing as a \u201cmistake\u201d, Callamard countered that a killing that implicated \u201ca consulate, requires preparation and planning and ultimately premeditation for 24 hours, is not a mistake.\u201d\n\nShe called for \u201ca transparent investigation into the chain of command\u201d around the killing and demanded the prince apologise to Khashoggi\u2019s family and fiancee.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince is trying to repair damage to his image done by Jamal Khashoggi's murder by insisting \"layers and layers\" of hierarchy separated him from the Saudi agents who killed the journalist, the U.N. investigator told Reuters.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435897777&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902VD", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
