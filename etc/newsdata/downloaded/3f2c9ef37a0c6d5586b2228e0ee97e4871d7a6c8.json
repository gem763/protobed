Turla then sought to compromise the operational platforms that APT34 used themselves. It is where the APT34's crown jewels are.'\n\nMr Chichester said exposing Turla was significant because of the new method of its espionage.\n\nIn a briefing to journalists, he said: 'We want to call out this behaviour and share the knowledge.\n\nSpooks at GCHQ (pictured, the headquarters in Cheltenham) have exposed a terror group that was masquerading as Iranian crooks\n\n'This is more assessment than fact - I think initially it looked more like an attempt to see how far they could go. That has given them, over time, a range of capabilities should they choose to do it. This is a real change in the modus operandi of a cyber attack.'\n\nThe UK-based cyber security experts, who worked in collaboration with their US counterparts, said Turla's intention was to masquerade as an adversary that victims might more likely think would target them.\n\nIt meant there was the potential for some cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to APT34, rather than Turla.\n\nHe said there was no evidence to believe that Iran was complicit in the cyberhack, nor was there any evidence of collusion.\n\n'This is a group of opportunists being inventive - we have got no evidence to suggest this is a politically led campaign,' he said.\n\n'We have never seen these done to the significance it has been done here, it is unique in its complexity.\n\n'It is not linked to a broader Russian campaign, we're calling it out because it is a new technique. There is not enough known about this in the public domain.'\n\nHe said members of the public would not be affected by the cyberhack, but said the NCSC wanted to share the success of the operation 'so targets can better defend themselves'.", "description": "The terror group Turla hijacked the Iranian hacking group APT34 to inflict attacks on 35 countries, most of which were in the Middle East, UK intelligence has revealed.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/07/19978508-0-image-a-13_1571639201361.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
