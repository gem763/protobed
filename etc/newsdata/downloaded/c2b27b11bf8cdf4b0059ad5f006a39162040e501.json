Are you talking about the violence from police who have aggressively attacked our protesters who are peacefully protesting,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI think the onus is on the police. The police attacked us first. We are peacefully demonstrating.\n\n\u201cThis conference is putting together some of the worst climate criminals who profiting off polluting the earth.\n\nmedia_camera Two people were arrested after allegedly assaulting a police horse.

And I was pushed to the ground. My back is still sore.\n\n\u201cIt was a man using his whole strength. I think I have a sprain, I am going to go to a doctor.\n\n\u201cHe kept saying you can move. But I was stuck. I was protesting peacefully.\n\n\u201cSome of the cops are very \u2026 and needlessly aggressive.

Climate activist Jacob Andrewartha told Sky News it was his \u201cright\u201d to shut down the International Mining and Resources Conference at the Convention Centre by forming a blockade of 300 people. Ms Jayes said climate activists would lose support from normal people by trying to bring a city to a standstill. \u201cWhy do 200 to 300 people have their arrogance to hold a whole city to ransom \u2026 you think you are going to get supporters by doing this?\u201d Mr Andrewartha said the disruption to the city was not as bad as a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and labelled mining workers \u201ccriminals\u201d. \u201cWe have a right to organise a mass number of protesters, like this, with the aim of shutting down the mining conference and making these climate criminals accountable.\u201d\n\nSupporter Sheena, who did not give her surname, brought her three-year-son to the protest.\n\nShe said she was fighting so he could grow up in a safe place.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important \u2013 they\u2019re taking Aboriginal land and are the main cause of climate change,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd they have blood on their hands. I think it\u2019s important that he grows up in a planet safe for him.\u201d\n\nOrganiser Emma Black, from the Blockade IMARC Alliance, said police were \u201cincredibly hostile\u201d already.\n\n\u201cThe police have been incredibly hostile. I\u2019m quite shocked,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis morning we were standing here very quietly \u2026 and the cops have been interrupting our ability to free speech.\u201d\n\nMs Black said the aim was still to shut down the conference. She said there were 23 groups involved in today\u2019s protests.\n\nmedia_camera A protester faces off with another man.

One police member received minor injuries during an arrest and is receiving medical treatment at the scene,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe injured police officer has since been taken to hospital.\n\nThe activists are lashing out against an international mining conference being held in Melbourne this week and have blocked the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre\u2019s main entrance.\n\nThe \u201cmass disruption\u201d will likely shut down Clarendon St during morning peak and aims to \u201cmake life hell\u201d for those heading to the conference.\n\nmedia_camera A mounted policeman attempts to break the crowd up.
