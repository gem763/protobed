The average room books for around $300 to $400 a night.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, GSA announced that it had chosen The Trump Organization to lease the property. The company pledged to spend $200 million to turn the structure into a 250-room luxury hotel.\n\nThe final lease was signed in 2013 and was for 60 years with the option for another 40 years. The hotel officially opened for business in the fall of 2016. Donald Trump took time off the campaign trail to attend.\n\nThe hotel has been at the center of allegations and lawsuits that charge President Trump violated the Constitution's ban on emoluments, which forbids a president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without the permission of Congress, with his ownership of the property.\n\nThe president is a frequent visitor to his DC property - dining there at its steak restaurant and hosting Republican Party fundraisers.\n\nLast month, a federal court ruled fellow hoteliers could sue the family over the property.\n\nEmoluments Clause The clause, contained in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, states: 'No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.'\n\nThe plaintiffs, including owners of high-end hotels and restaurants in New York City and Washington, argued they are harmed by competing with Trump's businesses over the exact same customer base when customers know that giving business to Trump's establishments might secure his favor in governmental decisions.\n\nTrump has made appearances at his resorts, golf clubs and a hotel in Washington frequently since he was sworn in as president in January 2017.\n\nRepresentatives of at least 22 foreign governments have spent money at Trump Organization properties, NBC News reported in June.\n\nThe president received $40.8 million in revenue from his Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, just blocks from the White House, in 2018, according to his financial disclosures for that year.\n\nHouse Democrats have launched an investigation into Trump's businesses practices, including whether he violated the Emoluments Clause, and the issue is being heard in the federal courts.\n\nEarlier this year a federal appeals court dismissed an Emoluments Clause lawsuit filed against Trump by the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia.\n\nBut, on Tuesday, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals voted to rehear that case.\n\nDonald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump, and Ivanka Trump opened the hotel in October 2016\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump break ground at the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C. in July 2014\n\nThe Trump hotel in Washington DC resides in the Old Post Office building, just blocks from the White House\n\nDonald Trump turned over his Trump Organization to his sons Eric and Don Jr after he became elected president\n\nThe Trump family decision to sell their opulent hotel in the nation's capitol comes after the president reversed a decision to hold next year's G20 conference at his Trump Doral property near Miami.\n\nThe original decision to host a gathering a world leaders at a property owned by the president led to a harsh round of criticism and the president's reversal came after members of his own party expressed concerned and said they would find difficulty defending the move.\n\nDonald Trump decided against selling his business after he was elected. He also declined to place his interests in a blind trust - as many elected officials do. Instead he handed over control to his eldest sons, Don J. and Eric.", "description": "Donald Trump's business arm is looking at selling his Washington D.C. hotel, partly because of criticism the family is facing for profiting from the property while the president sits in the Oval Office.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197988-0-image-a-2_1572036678815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
