Two of its pillars would be Social Security benefits and your required minimum distributions (RMDs) from IRAs, 401ks, and other retirement accounts.\n\nBut that still may not be enough to provide you with a comfortable standard of living in retirement or to prevent you from outliving your money.\n\nThat\u2019s where annuities come in. A times, annuities have a bad reputation. In this column I\u2019ll focus on a specific kind of annuity\u2014the single-premium immediate annuity (SPIA)\u2014which could be an excellent complement to Social Security and your RMDs. (I\u2019ll highlight other attractive annuity products in future columns.)\n\nWhen you buy a SPIA, you fork over (or annuitize) a lump sum to an insurance company and you\u2019ll start collecting a monthly benefit at a date of your choosing over the next year. Although most SPIAs are lifetime annuities, you can also buy them for, say, 10 years. You can also include a yearly cost of living adjustment (COLA) and leave the balance to your heirs after you pass on. Some of these extra features will reduce your monthly payout, so you have to be willing to make the trade-off.\n\nRead: Social Security is pretty great, but here\u2019s something that could improve it\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a man turning 65 and you\u2019re getting Social Security but you want an annuity \u201cpension\u201d as well, beginning in January 2020. You have $100,000 to invest. Using the calculators on www.immediateannuities.com, I got quotes from several insurers (all rated at least A) for a simple lifetime policy with a 2% annual COLA that offered payout rates ranging from 6.26% to 6.65%\u2014or monthly payments of $522-$554.\n\nFor a woman, the payout rate would be a lot lower\u2014mostly below 5%\u2014and you\u2019d receive $100 less a month, presumably because women live on average almost seven more years than men do in the U.S., so the insurer will have to pay out the balance over a longer time. (You can buy a joint policy that includes your spouse as well.)\n\nAnd unlike many annuities that charge steep commissions and annual fees, SPIAs are no-fee products, says Kyle Brossard, an agent at ImmediateAnnuities.com, based in Englishtown, N.J. He says his firm is paid a small commission from the insurers whose annuities they sell.\n\nRead: Sweden partially privatized its Social Security \u2014 here\u2019s how it has worked out\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s profitable, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge moneymaker for them,\u201d Brossard told me. Insurance companies make money by investing the premiums they receive, mostly in the bond market. So, you\u2019ll get a steady payout, while big insurers take on more risk to earn higher yields in, say, corporate bonds or emerging market debt. Better them than you, as my mother used to say.\n\nThe good news is there are no steep surrender charges on these policies. The bad news? There\u2019s no surrendering them while you\u2019re alive or during the term of the policy. That\u2019s why taking a lower monthly payout to leave any balance to your heirs is probably a good idea.\n\nOne other possible drawback: If you\u2019re funding an annuity with money from a tax-deferred retirement account (not a Roth), you\u2019ll be taxed at your ordinary income rate on the payouts you receive. Please consult your tax adviser.\n\nUnlike other annuities, which are so complex even math teachers can\u2019t understand them, SPIAs are pretty straightforward. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple product. It\u2019s something the public wants,\u201d says Brossard.\n\nSales of all fixed annuities (of which SPIAs are a small part) rose 27% to $133.5 billion in 2018, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nWade D. Pfau, a professor at the American College of Financial Services in King of Prussia, Pa., has published a paper on the role SPIAs can play in securing people\u2019s retirement.\n\nRead: How to raise frugal kids as you save for early retirement\n\nFor a 65-year-old couple whose Social Security benefit equals 2% of their retirement assets and who have a standard 4% annual withdrawal rate from their retirement accounts, a combination of stocks and a SPIA would be an \u201coptimal\u201d allocation, Pfau concludes.\n\n\u201c...Clients need not bother with bonds, inflation-adjusted SPIAs or [variable annuities],\u201d he writes. \u201cThough SPIAs do not offer liquidity, they provide mortality credits and generate bondlike income without any maturity date\u2026\u201d\n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend retirees put 100% of their investible assets into equities, but buying a SPIA would allow you to hold slightly more stock and reduce your bond allocation. Bonds are particularly difficult investments these days when the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields 2% and may be headed lower.\n\nEven Ken Fisher, founder of Fisher Investments, whose whole marketing pitch is that he\u2019d \u201crather die and go to hell before selling an annuity,\u201d wrote in USAToday that SPIAs \u201ccan be OK, done right.\u201d That may be damning with faint praise or high praise indeed from an avowed annuity hater. Either way, this kind of annuity is worth exploring.", "description": "Immediate annuities are good bets in a low-yield world", "authors": ["Howard Gold"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GC527_spock__ZG_20180126110132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
