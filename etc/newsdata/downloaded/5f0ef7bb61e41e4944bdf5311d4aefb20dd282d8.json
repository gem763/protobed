(AP) \u2014 Bernie Sanders began reintroducing himself to the 2020 campaign on Tuesday, venturing outside his Vermont home to say that he doesn\u2019t plan on leaving the presidential race following last week\u2019s heart attack \u2014 but that he may slow down a frenetic pace that might have contributed to his health problems.\n\n\u201cWe were doing, in some cases, five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that,\u201d Sanders told reporters when asked what his schedule may look like going forward. \u201cBut I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit. I\u2019ll make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d\n\nPressed on what that meant, Sanders replied: \u201cWell, probably not doing four rallies a day.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign has said he will be at next week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio. But it hasn\u2019t commented on if or when he\u2019ll resume campaigning before that \u2014 or what his next steps will be. NBC News announced it would air an \u201cexclusive\u201d interview with Sanders, his first since the heart attack, on Wednesday.\n\nHis health problems come at a precarious time, since Sanders was already facing questions about being the oldest candidate seeking the White House, and he has seen his recent poll numbers decline compared to 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren, his chief competitor for the Democratic Party\u2019s most-progressive wing.\n\nSanders, a Vermont senator, also recently shook up his campaign staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, which kick off the presidential nominating process.\n\n\u201cI must confess, I was dumb,\u201d Sanders said in front of his house, speaking in soft, calm tones with his wife, Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, looking on behind him. \u201cThank God, I have a lot of energy, and during this campaign I\u2019ve been doing, in some cases, three or four rallies a day all over the state, Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms.\u201d\n\nSupporters privately conceded that the timing of the heart attack \u2014 which came just as the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump was escalating \u2014 helped limit the political fallout. But they also acknowledge that he will have to more directly address lingering health concerns then, if not before.\n\nAnd they hinted changes would be coming to better keep their candidate healthy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at everything \u2014 the whole campaign in its totality \u2014 and make adjustments where necessary,\u201d said national campaign co-chair Nina Turner, who spoke with Sanders at length on Tuesday during a call with his four national co-chairs. \u201cBut make no mistake: Sen. Bernie Sanders is as committed \u2014 more so, even more now than he always has been, if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d\n\nLast week began on a high note when Sanders announced that he\u2019d raised $25.3 million during the year\u2019s third quarter, more than Warren and any other Democratic presidential hopeful. But word of that was overshadowed hours later Tuesday, when Sanders was at a campaign event in Nevada, experienced chest discomfort and was taken to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with a heart attack.\n\nDoctors inserted two stents to open up a blocked artery in his heart. Sanders left the hospital on Friday and flew home to Vermont the following morning.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a major heart attack. He had a minor heart attack. The stents will be extremely helpful in terms of blood flow. I assume he\u2019ll be far more vigorous,\u201d said RoseAnn DeMoro, a Sanders\u2019 confidante and former executive director of National Nurses United. \u201cHeaven help the opposition.\u201d\n\nHis campaign noted that he had $33.7 million in cash on hand in the quarter that ended last month and, on Monday, he released a plan to impose stricter campaign finance limits. The plan was in the works for weeks before Sanders took ill, advisers say, but they declined to comment on the effectiveness of campaigning via press release \u2014 simply issuing policy statements without a candidate out there campaigning to back them up. Surrogates have taken Sanders\u2019 place on the campaign trail in the meantime, including Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, who visited New Hampshire on Saturday.\n\nSanders has been active in recent days communicating with his staff and broader network of longtime supporters. Those who have spoken to him say he is quick to shout down questions about his health, insisting that he\u2019s fine \u2014 and that he vowed to remain committed to the 2020 race in a Monday conference call with his entire campaign staff.\n\nSupporters also say the campaign has seen a surge in fundraising while he recuperates \u2014 though it hasn\u2019t released figures to quantify that.\n\nSanders said Tuesday that he would be meeting with the cardiologist on a regular basis and getting some checkups, but that his main doctor is in Washington, meaning he didn\u2019t have a physician in Vermont, \u201clet alone a cardiologist.\u201d He previously promised to release his medical records and reiterated that, saying, \u201cWe will release them at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPeoples reported from New York.
