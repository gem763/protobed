What it also reintroduced is the nagging suspicion the Nationals are tight-roping significant portions of these games, and if the Astros are going to continue to force early bullpen innings, and if the Nationals are not going to hit exactly as they did in the first two games, then they ought to get to work on that net.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSome time had passed since the Nationals\u2019 bullpen reminded anyone that it was, indeed, at the end of the day, at the end of the game, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen. For that, it can be commended.\n\nThrough the eight-game October winning streak, manager Davey Martinez (and, presumably, general manager Mike Rizzo) endeavored to shorten the rotation of relievers, mostly to Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson, and feathered in some Patrick Corbin and Tanner Rainey.\n\nThe result, over those eight wins \u2014 the last two in the division series, all four of the NLCS, and the first two of the World Series \u2014 was 22 \u2153 relief innings and four runs allowed. In Friday night\u2019s loss, managing in a three-run deficit, Martinez got 3 \u2154 more scoreless innings from Fernando Rodney, Joe Ross and Wander Suero.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, really, the Nationals still were operating in the black, seeing as the loss cost them little in the way of leverage relievers as the series continued.\n\nThe issue, turned out, was the Nationals\u2019 definition of leverage, that coming in the seventh inning of Game 4, as the Astros continued to pull away from two unsightly losses in Houston that began the series. There was another issue, and that is, when you have two \u2014 and only two \u2014 sturdy relievers, is there such a thing as leverage in a three-run deficit? How about at seven runs? And maybe that\u2019s the answer. Because without honoring the first, you\u2019re opening yourself up to the second.\n\nFernando Rodney allowed a grand slam to Alex Bregman in Game 4 of the World Series. (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)\n\nBecause, pulling from the shadows of his bullpen, and given one of his more trusted bullpen elements \u2014 Corbin \u2014 started Game 4, Martinez was again in the position of being all in (with Doolittle and/or Hudson) or in the mood to gamble from three runs back, and chose to roll again. Rainey and Rodney then combined to put Game 4 away, that being for the Astros. Whether the Nationals could have come back from four runs over the final three innings is speculation only, and whether to spend Doolittle and/or Hudson to find out is the musings of a man with a long, full bullpen.\n\nThis is, either way, how it looks when a manager hopes to maneuver four starters, one of whom is a part-time reliever, and two reliable relievers through an entire month.\n\nSaturday night was actually the second consecutive game in which it appeared part of the in-game decisions were based on the short bullpen and when to fire those bullets. On Friday night, in the fourth inning of a 2-1 game, with Nationals starter Anibal Sanchez at 65 pitches and unlikely to go much further, Martinez had Sanchez bat with one out and a runner at third base. Sanchez struck out, of course. The Nationals never did pull even and eventually lost by three runs.\n\nIf the bullpen scares him a little bit, and he\u2019d have every right to it, then Martinez would be reluctant to leave five innings out there. As it happened, Sanchez was able to record only four more outs (and allow two more runs), and the game never felt very close.\n\nAsked afterward about the opportunity to pinch-hit for Sanchez, Martinez admitted, \u201cI seriously thought about it, yeah.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also four games into the World Series, has other issues to consider -- the Nationals have scored twice in two games, for one, first against a wobbly Zack Greinke and then what turned out to be a taut Jose Urquidy, and are one for 19 with runners in scoring position in those games \u2014 and has gotten \u2014 or asked for \u2014 eight outs from his two best relievers.\n\nAgain, it is a question of what is leverage and what is pipe dream, what is smart and what unnecessarily taxes a bullpen for tomorrow, which is a terrible position to be in some days, worse when those days are in late October.\n\n\u201cFor me,\u201d Martinez said late Saturday night, \u201cyou don\u2019t chase wins.\u201d\n\nBy that, he meant, from behind, or from far behind, which, apparently, is three or four runs. So, he\u2019d sat through a seventh inning in which he summoned Rainey, who went walk, walk, fly out. Then Rodney, who went single, home run. The Astros\u2019 lead went from 4-1 to 8-1, so at least the decisions got easier from there.\n\n\u201cCome tomorrow, [if] we\u2019re up, 2-0, and all of a sudden you\u2019re in the seventh inning, you have to use Hudson for two innings [or] you have to use Doolittle for two innings,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cYou want those guys ready to pitch. I know we got a day off the next day. All this we talked about before the game. But [tonight], you\u2019re down still three runs and, like I said, Rainey has done well for us. It just happens he couldn\u2019t throw strikes tonight.\u201d\n\nThere are no pretty answers. And, if they\u2019re fortunate, and Max is Max and Stras is Stras and somebody can get a hit with runners in scoring position, there\u2019ll hardly be any more questions. By then, and with any luck, the Nationals will have either won the series or played themselves into a Game 7, at which point we\u2019ll have to start the whole conversation over again.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Some time had passed since the Nationals\u2019 bullpen reminded anyone that it was, indeed, at the end of the day, at the end of the game, the Nationals\u2019 bullpen.
