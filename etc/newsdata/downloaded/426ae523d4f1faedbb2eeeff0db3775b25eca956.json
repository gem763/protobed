We would like it to show today the same spirit towards us,\" the embassy said in its statement.\n\nFrance's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by John Irish Editing by Robert Birsel)", "description": "China's embassy in Paris on Monday strongly criticised French and European reaction to protests in Hong Kong calling it hypocritical and telling France to show empathy after it experienced its own violent demonstrations.  \"We express our deep dissatisfaction and our profound contempt for the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
