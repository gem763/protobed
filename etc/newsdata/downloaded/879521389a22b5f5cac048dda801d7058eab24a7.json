The Top Tier Is All White.", "language": "en", "text": "When the Democratic primary contest began last winter, it featured the most racially diverse field in history, with two black senators, a Latino former Cabinet secretary, an Asian-American businessman and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men.\n\nCandidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, will qualify.\n\nWith the Iowa caucuses three months away, it\u2019s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership \u2014 not to mention the affected candidates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, \u2018Is America ready for another black president?\u2019\u201d Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident it\u2019s never been asked of a white candidate, \u2018Is America ready for another white president?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe emergence of an all-white top tier reflects a combination of factors at the intersection of race, money and politics.\n\nFinancial support from mostly white, educated elites has helped propel the candidacies of Warren and Buttigieg, while two nonwhite candidates \u2014 Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have had to explicitly petition supporters for money to stay in the race.\n\nAssumptions about which candidates can or can\u2019t beat President Donald Trump have also hurt minority candidates, with some Democrats fearing that the white working class voters who helped propel Trump to the White House would not support a nonwhite nominee. Donors for Booker and Harris have argued that such implicit bias causes voters and pundits to treat Buttigieg as the natural heir to Biden\u2019s moderate coalition, though their candidates perform better among older black voters, the Democrats\u2019 most loyal moderate voting block.\n\nOther Democrats, however, say the blame rests with the candidates themselves. None of the nonwhite challengers have been able to forge a strong coalition or peel away black voters from Biden. Some voters and elected officials, white and nonwhite alike, say privately what the polling suggests: They have not been swept off their feet by any of the candidates of color.\n\nTheodore Johnson, who studies African-American politics at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the nonwhite contenders, fairly or not, are suffering in comparison to the country\u2019s first black president.\n\n\u201cTheir road is easier because of Obama, but their ability to secure the nomination is harder because they\u2019re not Obama,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMiscalculations along the way have not helped. Harris has been criticized for waffling on policy, Booker for timidness and Castro for a failed debate attack on Biden in September, which cost him the endorsement of one of his few congressional allies.\n\nCastro, in an interview, zeroed in on \u201celectability\u201d as a problem, saying that concept has created an unspoken skepticism of nonwhite candidates among Democratic voters. People with this viewpoint, he said, can sometimes see nonwhite candidates as vice-presidential options, but not best equipped to lead the party.\n\n\u201cIn every election there\u2019s a current, and the current this year seems to be running toward candidates that people believe can take Donald Trump on with a certain profile of voter \u2014 the white working class in the Midwest,\u201d said Castro, whose polling support is running at about 1%.\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cassumptions are being made on who the best type of candidates are to do that.\u201d\n\nBooker said he thinks the tide will turn as more people seek a strong candidate to replace Biden as the moderate alternative to Warren and Sanders.
