REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nHere is a summary of what he said:\n\nCONSTRUCTIVE PROPOSALS\n\nJohnson said he was submitting \u201cconstructive and reasonable proposals\u201d to the EU and that he hoped that Brussels would also find room to compromise to secure a deal.\n\n\u201cToday in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals, which provide a compromise for both sides,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd yes this is a compromise by the UK, and I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn.\u201d\n\nTIME TO DELIVER BREXIT\n\nJohnson said it was time to get Brexit done, pledging again that he would take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 \u201ccome what may\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are coming out of the EU on October 31, come what may... let\u2019s get Brexit done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can we must and we will.\u201d\n\nNO CHECKS AT IRISH BORDER\n\nThe 500-km (300-mile) land border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland has become the sticking point in efforts to agree on the terms of an orderly British exit from the European Union.\n\nIreland says an invisible border is a key national interest as any checks or infrastructure on the frontier could undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s 1998 peace deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nJohnson said his proposals will not include plans for customs infrastructure at the border.\n\n\u201cWe will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement.\u201d\n\nCONSENT\n\nHe said that the Northern Irish assembly would be given a \u201crenewable\u201d say over regulatory arrangements. The United Kingdom, he said, would leave the EU \u201cwhole and entire\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland, we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start,\u201d he said.\n\nEU NEEDS TO COMPROMISE\n\nJohnson said the EU needs to prepared to accept new technology to solve the issue of preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nHe said if the EU fail to be more flexible then he is ready to take Britain out of the bloc without a divorce deal.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen that technology is improving the whole time. Then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal. That is not an outcome we want.\u201d\n\nNO SECOND REFERENDUM\n\nJohnson ruled out holding a second Brexit referendum.\n\n\u201cA second referendum on the EU? Can you imagine? Another 3 years of this?,\u201d he said.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday unveiled some proposals for an amended Brexit agreement with the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436225866&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910X3"}
