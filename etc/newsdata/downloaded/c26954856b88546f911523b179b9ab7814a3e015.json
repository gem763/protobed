They asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement. Rabin and a spokesman for Glass Lewis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGlass Lewis advises shareholders on how to vote on corporate governance issues such as pay, deals and directors. The San Francisco-based firm distributes its research to more than 1,300 institutional clients, including the bulk of the world\u2019s biggest pension plans and asset managers.\n\nRabin joined Glass Lewis in 2003, shortly after the firm was founded, and has served as its chief executive for the last 12 years. During her tenure, Glass Lewis grew as the proxy advisory industry\u2019s second largest player after ISS, guiding how shareholder votes representing trillions of dollars worth of shares are cast.\n\nHowever unlike ISS, Glass Lewis did not expand in areas such as consulting services for investors.\n\nBefore joining Glass Lewis, Rabin was vice president of communications at supply chain management company QRS Corp, where she helped create its investor relations program.\n\nCanadian pension fund Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan spent $46 million to buy Glass Lewis from Xinhua Finance in 2007. In 2013, another Canadian pension fund, Alberta Investment Management Corp, bought a 20% stake in Glass Lewis from Ontario Teachers\u2019 for an undisclosed sum.\n\nLast month, the SEC issued new guidance that aims to clarify how investors and advisory firms that cast ballots on their behalf should vote in corporate elections on issues like pay and diversity.\n\nThe guidance, which expands previous 2014 guidance on shareholder voting in corporate ballots, addresses some of the grievances U.S. corporations have long had about so-called proxy advisers, such as mistakes in reports the advisers issue on specific companies and conflicts of interest in their business models.", "description": "Katherine \"KT\" Rabin is stepping down as CEO of Glass Lewis & Co, after spending more than a decade at the helm of the influential proxy advisory firm that shapes the outcome of major corporate ballots, according to people familiar with the matter.", "authors": ["Svea Herbst-Bayliss", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
