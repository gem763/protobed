Some migrants have thrown themselves overboard rather than be taken back by the Libyan coastguard.\n\n'Fast-track'\n\nFour EU nations will seek endorsement next week from their bloc partners for a \"fast-track system\" for getting migrants off boats in trouble in the Mediterranean and distributing people on board who want to seek asylum among countries willing to take them.\n\nGermany, France, Italy and Malta want approval for a process that would screen refugees and migrants, relocate asylum seekers and return people who do not apply or qualify, all within four weeks, according to a statement obtained by the civil liberties watchdog Statewatch.\n\nThe statement said all vessels engaged in rescue operations would be required \"to comply with instructions given by the competent Rescue Coordination Center\", which in most cases probably means the Libyan authorities.\n\nThey are warned not to obstruct search and rescue operations by official coastguard ships, including the ones operated by Libyan authorities.\n\nEU member countries are urged to provide more aircraft and drones so aerial surveillance can be increased near the Northern African coast.\n\nIn a veiled warning to NGOs actively looking for migrant boats in distress in the Mediterranean, the four countries underlined that \"the facilitation of illegal migration at sea is an offence\" and that \"the systematic activity facilitating irregular migration poses a particular cause for concern\".", "description": "It is the sixth year in a row that more than 1,000 deaths have been registered in a single year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/a311d6b783464a00aaf590d4ef309343_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
