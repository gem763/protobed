In fact, you have high expectations for me as your president. I promise to learn from this experience.\u201d\n\nHarvard did not comment further.\n\nSome staffers felt Bacow\u2019s analogy was \u201ctone deaf\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis was not an appropriate comparison,\u201d one told the Globe.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Harvard has a \u201chistory with slavery\u201d and attempts to atone have included the installation of a plaque in honor of four people who were enslaved there in the 1700s. In 2017, Harvard hosted a symposium that examined the relationship between slavery and higher-education institutions.\n\nBacow\u2019s comments come on the heels of controversy over the college\u2019s acceptance of donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in jail earlier this year.\n\nHarvard accepted some $9m prior to Epstein\u2019s 2008 guilty plea to prostitution charges in Florida. The institution rejected a donation after his conviction. The politically connected financier did not attend Harvard.\n\nEarlier this month, Bacow wrote in an email to students and faculty that Epstein\u2019s behavior was \u201crepulsive and reprehensible\u201d and \u201craises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors\u201d.\n\nBacow said $186,000 from Epstein\u2019s donations remained and would be distributed to organizations that help human victims of sexual assault and human trafficking.", "description": "* Larry Bacow apologises for remark about 13th amendment  * Colleges should not try to \u2018own\u2019 wealthy alumniThe Widener Library in Harvard Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
