But the devices that special operators rely on in the field to collect and analyze such data are sometimes unreliable and can require that the target be a living person with a pulse to provide accurate results.\n\nTeam members would also collect DNA samples, in the form of body parts or blood. Over the past two to three years, advances in DNA technology have led to the production of portable Rapid DNA devices, which can provide accurate automated results in as little as 90 minutes. Both the Pentagon and the F.B.I. have invested in the technology.\n\nRapid DNA machines can be as small as a microwave, and easily stored in a military helicopter. It is not known whether the forces who conducted Saturday\u2019s raid had one on hand. One official said that had not been the practice of special operators to date. The samples could have been flown to a military facility elsewhere for the DNA testing.\n\nIf DNA provided the positive identification, as is probable, a key question is what sample the military used to confirm a match.\n\nIdentifying someone by DNA often involves matching one sample to another that is known to come from the same person. It is possible that the United States sampled and stored Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s DNA when he was imprisoned at an American-run detention center in Iraq in the mid-2000s.", "description": "American officials identified the body of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi swiftly, even after he blew himself up.", "authors": ["Michael Crowley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/world/27dc-dna3/27dc-dna3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
