Katie Tabb was a PwC director for about seven months. She is now a vice-president at JP Morgan. Virginie Maikim had worked at PwC for five years, and was an associate director in her last role. She is now an associate at JP Morgan, as is Alli Peacock, who was an associate director at PwC, where she worked for six years.\n\n\"PwC was understandably disappointed,\" Ms Mooney told The Australian Financial Review. \"They didn\u2019t want us to go but if we wanted to go they were going to support it. I am sure they would rather have us here rather than at one of the other big four.\"\n\nA PwC spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nBanking has a better track record than professional services for gender parity at management level. According to the latest stats from the federal government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency, 40.7 per cent of managers in the finance sector are women compared with 34.1 per cent at professional services firms such as PwC.\n\nNew York-headquartered JP Morgan is the leading global investment bank this year with almost $US5 billion ($7.5 billion) in fee income, followed by Goldman Sachs with $US4.3 billion in fees, according to the Financial Times.\n\nMs Mooney said her team was likely to focus on companies selling or making consumer goods, healthcare and technology.\n\n\"People in Australia think the investment banks, especially the global ones, will only do really big deals,\" Ms Mooney said. \"I don\u2019t want anyone to think they are too small to come to us.\"\n\nMs Mooney is known in the investment banking industry for her fanatical interest in skiing. Her last skiing holiday was in February to Revelstoke resort and Galena lodge in Canada.", "description": "Annabelle Mooney was one of PwC's hottest partner recruits in years.
