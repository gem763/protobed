A report by research firm eMarketer predicted China would be the world's top e-commerce market in 2019, with sales expected to hit $1.935 trillion.\n\nAccording to property consultancy firm JLL, Chinese mega cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are seeing \"robust demand\" for industrial real estate, which includes warehouse facilities and distribution centers.\n\nJLL also wrote that the \"primary drivers of market demand in these markets continue to be retail, e-commerce, manufacturing and third-party logistics firms.\"", "description": "China's e-commerce boom is fueling demand for storage spaces and offers opportunities for those looking into putting their money in real estate, says Jean Eric Salata from Baring Private Equity Asia.", "authors": ["Abigail Ng"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106142035-1569049222050gettyimages-1066565566.jpeg?v=1569049322", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
