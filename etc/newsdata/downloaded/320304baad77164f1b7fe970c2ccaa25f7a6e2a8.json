This follows the general public\u2019s growing concerns about the system\u2019s unfair targeting of the vulnerable, as well as the heartbreaking findings released earlier in the year that over 2000 Australians died after receiving a debatable robo-debt from the government.\n\nGordon Legal will be actioning the suit, on the grounds that the government have generalised thousands of unique circumstances with a computer algorithm and subsequently preyed on the weak.\n\nPeter Gordon, senior partner at the firm, elaborated in an official statement: \u201cInvestigations reveal between $2-3 million have been wrongly taken from people and making it even worse was many were hit with penalties of 10 percent on those amounts.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe\u2019ll allege that to simply collect money from hundreds of thousands of people by the simplistic application of an imperfect computer algorithm is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think that before the Government docked the pensions or took the tax refunds of widows and carers and aged pensioners it needed to have better evidence, it needed to consider each case individually.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE The Government Is Doubling Down On Its Fucked Centrelink Robodebt Program\n\nBill Shorten, shadow minister for government services, has publicly backed the class action, suggesting that it\u2019s time to suggest the legality of the scheme.\n\n\u201cThe Government has used a flawed calculation system to unlawfully take back millions of dollars from pensioners,\u201d Shorten released in an official statement. \u201cThe Federal Government has financially benefited by wrongfully taking and banking money that legitimately belonged to recipients.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe robo-debt scheme \u2013 including its reverse onus of proof \u2013 is at best legally dubious and should rightly have its legality determined by a court.\u201d\n\n\u201cStress, heartbreak, suicides \u2013 this is the trail of carnage that robo-debt has wrought.\u201d\n\nNow over to the High Court.
