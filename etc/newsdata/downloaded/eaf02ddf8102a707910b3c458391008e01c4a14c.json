He said Boris Johnson's proposals might even require the EU to suspend its own rules.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barnier: UK Brexit proposals must protect peace in Ireland\n\nWhile Downing Street insists their Brexit proposals are serious and that the onus is also on the EU make compromises, Brussels seems demotivated.\n\n\"Even if we manage to reach an agreement with (Boris) Johnson - which is an outside chance anyway,\" a diplomat from a southern European country told me me, \"do we really think that the angry, divided House of Commons will approve a Johnson-brokered Brexit deal?\"\n\nThe diplomat clearly didn't. And that's important. It means the EU believes there is no point compromising right now.\n\nBrussels is also unconvinced that the prime minister is willing to make what they view as real compromises in negotiations. They think he wants to keep his hard Brexiteer credentials intact ahead of a general election.\n\nSo is the EU assuming that a no-deal Brexit is round the corner?\n\nNot really. EU politicians now believe a new three-month Brexit extension is the most likely next step. And Boris Johnson is right. That belief does take the pressure off them somewhat. It's yet another factor deterring Brussels from offering significant compromises in current negotiations.\n\nBut the EU is aware that the route to a new extension is neither straightforward nor guaranteed.\n\nParliament may have passed a law instructing the government to request a new extension if a Brexit deal isn't reached by mid-October. But if Boris Johnson refuses - as he insists would be the case - then EU leaders would normally listen to him, their peer, as head of Her Majesty's government.\n\nEU sources point at Spain (and the Catalan issue) as to why leaders alone - not parliaments - represent member countries at the EU table.\n\nBut as so often when it comes to Brexit, this situation is messy.\n\nImage caption EU diplomats suggest Boris Johnson might refuse an extension and resign after 31 October to stay clear of any political fallout\n\nIn fact, EU lawyers won't give a definite answer as to what the EU would definitely do if, with a no deal Brexit looming, parliament demands a new Brexit extension while the prime minister says no.\n\nEU rules on how to deal with a departing country - the so-called Article 50 text - don't specify that an extension request must come from a government but rather from \"the member state concerned\".\n\nThe EU could offer an extension unprompted but the decision to trigger one has to be unanimous amongst EU leaders and the UK.\n\nThis is a real nail-biter for EU leaders. They have so wanted to stay out of UK domestic politics, but if and when it comes to the extension debate, they could find themselves slap bang in the middle of the fight between parliament and the PM.\n\nAlways keen to kick the can down the road when agreement can't yet be reached, EU diplomats muse that, with his options dwindling, Boris Johnson could choose to make a big stand at the October summit, ostentatiously refusing to ask for an extension when he meets with EU leaders (to score points with hard-line Brexiteers at home) and then resign. This would allow him to keep his hands clean of any extension, while a caretaker government requests one.\n\nEU hopefuls cite this hypothetical scenario as a reason not to give up. A three-month extension, they say, could allow time to agree a compromise Brexit deal with the UK by the end of the year.\n\nOr not. Glued as they are to watching the heated House of Commons scenes on their screens, EU insiders readily admit no-one has a clue what might happen in UK politics right now from one day to the next.", "description": "But the EU is aware that the route to a new extension is neither straightforward nor guaranteed.", "authors": ["Katya Adler", "Europe Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/151F2/production/_108641568_b8f4525d-fcc7-445a-a510-3110a7ad21c2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
