Revenues at the firm rose about 53% to \u00a3179 million.\n\nTransferWise, which was recently valued at $3.5 billion, has shaken up the money transfer industry with an online platform that it says allows people to send money abroad at a fraction of the cost offered by banks and the likes of Western Union and MoneyGram.\n\nIt was set up in 2011 by Estonian friends Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Kaarmann with the stated aim of making foreign exchange fees more transparent. Kaarmann, TransferWise's CEO, said the firm was among a \"rare breed of unicorns\" that have managed to create a profitable business.\n\n\"This is indeed rare, but it is very important for us internally,\" Kaarmann told CNBC in a phone interview. \"We really only know if the product works once the product works on its own and doesn't need any extra cash to support it.\"\n\nMany other fintech unicorns \u2014 private companies worth $1 billion or more \u2014 have so far failed to generate an annual profit. Monzo's losses climbed to \u00a347.2 million in the fiscal year ending February 2019, while Revolut last year reported a \u00a314.8 million for 2017.", "description": "TransferWise posted an annual net profit of \u00a310.3 million on revenues of \u00a3179 million.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105925754-1558468132679taavet_kristo5543.jpg?v=1558469039", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
