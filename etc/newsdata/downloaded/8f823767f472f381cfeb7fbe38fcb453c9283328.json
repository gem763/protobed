Everton have still not managed to come from behind to win a game under Marco Silva though a much improved performance almost earned them a point against the defending champions.\n\nHenderson howler hands Liverpool narrow win at spirited Sheffield United Read more\n\nA draw would have done their neighbours a favour by opening up a seven-point gap at the top of the table, and Everton were on course until Riyad Mahrez struck from a set piece with 20 minutes remaining. That was slightly ironic since Everton\u2019s chief second-half threat had come from Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s delivery of free-kicks and corners, with Yerry Mina in particular using his height to advantage, yet on the balance of chances created from open play the visitors deserved the victory even before Raheem Sterling made sure of it with a late left-foot volley.\n\n\u201cIt was a good game, this is a difficult place to come,\u201d Pep Guardiola said. \u201cIt is only September but we still needed to win after Liverpool won. The season is long and we just have to keep going.\u201d Marco Silva said he was encouraged by everything except the result. \u201cThere were a lot of positives, and in the second half we had a couple of big chances to affect the result, but we didn\u2019t take them. City were more clinical with theirs.\u201d\n\nThere was no goal after 53 seconds, as City had managed against Watford last week, but if anything the game got off to an even more eventful start. First Theo Walcott departed on a stretcher after being knocked out by taking the ball in the face, six minutes of treatment on the pitch having failed to bring him round. Walcott was taken to hospital before later being released. Then Ilkay G\u00fcndogan hit the bar while practically standing on the Everton goalline, Mahrez\u2019s fierce cross reaching him too quickly to adjust his feet in time, and when Jordan Pickford made his second save of the afternoon from the industrious Mahrez barely five minutes of play had taken place.\n\nOnce the contest settled down a little a well-worked Everton move ended with Sigurdsson seeing a shot blocked by Fernandinho, before City took the lead midway through the first half. Again Mahrez was involved, breaking down the right to set up Kevin De Bruyne for a cross, predictably sent early and accurately into the space right in front of Pickford where Gabriel Jesus twisted his body impressively to score with a close-range header.\n\nSigurdsson brought a save from Ederson as Everton attempted to hit back but Mahrez tested Pickford again at the other end, putting his shot too close to the goalkeeper after bursting into space. When Everton did equalise after half an hour it was from an unexpected source, S\u00e9amus Coleman delicately lifting a shot over Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Ederson from a narrow angle after the ball had broken free from Alex Iwobi. It was a shot, not a cross, and though Dominic Calvert-Lewin got a final touch on the line to claim the goal, the ball was going in anyway.\n\nCity should have gone back in front just before the interval when a fine pass from Mahrez found Jesus in the clear but brought only a hesitant finish, the striker taking a touch to switch feet and ending up missing the target. There were chances for G\u00fcndogan and De Bruyne at the start of the second half and a decent one for Richarlison too, who headed wastefully from a Sigurdsson free-kick. The Brazilian sensibly left the next set-piece opportunity to Michael Keane and Yerry Mina, who combined to bring a first-class save from Ederson, clawing the ball out from under his crossbar.\n\nHarry Kane rescues Hugo Lloris as 10-man Tottenham beat Southampton Read more\n\nCity produced a stunning opening on the hour when an exquisite through ball from Mahrez played Sterling in behind a square Everton defence, yet from close to the penalty spot with only Pickford to beat the winger slid his first-time shot the wrong side of an upright. The travelling support took up a chant of \u201cSergio, Sergio\u201d almost immediately, and five minutes later the Argentinian was introduced, though it was Mahrez, whose performance deserved a goal, who made the breakthrough. City had a range of options when De Bruyne was fouled by Mina on the edge of the area, but Mahrez took the free-kick and cleared the wall with a shot that beat Pickford\u2019s somewhat unconvincing dive.\n\nCity were indebted to Ederson for keeping out Calvert-Lewin after Sigurdsson carved out a chance, though the home side\u2019s search for an equaliser inevitably left gaps at the rear.\n\nAfter Mahrez had accelerated into one Sergio Ag\u00fcero arrived at his shoulder to take over and drive across goal, where Sterling was able to fasten on to a rebound and steer the ball over the line. The goal had to be confirmed by technology, but the City fans in the Bullens Road stand had the perfect view and were already celebrating.", "description": "Raheem Sterling capped off the scoring late on as Manchester City stayed within five points of the Premier league leaders Liverpool after beating Everton 3-1 win at Goodison Park", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d623fa88732cc19fa892310afd79bfcd69e6d2/0_90_2699_1619/master/2699.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b462d84042cfffcdf548dd9f5a61236", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
