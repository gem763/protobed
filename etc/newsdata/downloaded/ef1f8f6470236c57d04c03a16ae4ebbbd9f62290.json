But you\u2019re going to feel the elements in all of the tracks.\u2019\n\nThe 31-year-old went on to say: \u2018Reggae always feels right to me. It\u2019s in my blood. It doesn\u2019t matter how far or long removed I am from that culture, or my environment that I grew up in; it never leaves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s always the same high. Even though I\u2019ve explored other genres of music, it was time to go back to something that I haven\u2019t really homed in on completely for a body of work.\u2019\n\nHowever, she\u2019s keeping tight-lipped about the new project as she refused to confirm a release date.\n\nWe can but dream, right?\n\nShe\u2019s not giving too much away about R9 (Picture: WireImage)\n\nAlthough RiRi has had R9 in the making for years, she\u2019s taking her time with it as she confirmed back in September that no new music is dropping just yet.\n\nAsked when she will release an album, she said: \u2018Whatever I do is gonna be confident whether it\u2019s the album, perfume, lingerie, make-up, or fashion. Y\u2019all gonna have to wait. Navy, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWe\u2019ll just be over here sobbing.\n\nHowever, she definitely hasn\u2019t forgotten about it as she dismissed suggestions about performing at the Super Bowl.\n\nShe told Entertainment Tonight: \u2018I still got an album to finish. You gonna ask me about Super Bowl? My fans about to have my neck.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, she\u2019s keeping herself busy after she announced a new \u2018visual autobiography\u2019, revealing she\u2019s been spending the past half-decade working on it.\n\nWe won\u2019t blame her if we don\u2019t get new music right away then \u2013 she\u2019s a busy lady to say the least.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
