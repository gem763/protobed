The deterioration of Iran\u2019s economy, under a set of sanctions, including its crucial oil exports, by the US has negatively affected Iranian allies and proxies in the region, including Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Iran also seems unable to maintain its energy supplies to the Syrian regime or payments for Russian oil to Damascus, which have been covered by Iran.\n\nBut since pulling out of Syria, Trump is giving some relief and more space for Iran\u2019s allies to score strategic gains on the ground, eyeing the oil fields in Kurdish held areas.\n\nWhy Iran doesn\u2019t want US troops in Syria\n\nBecause of the strategic corridor which links Iran with Lebanon on the Mediterranean Sea, through Iraq and Syria.\n\nPresident Trump has vowed to push against Iran expanding influence in the region in his bid to ensure Israel\u2019s security and the interests of his allies in the Gulf. But the drawdown from Syria is expected to give Iran a free ride in the country and a chance to entrench its interests in yet another strategic area.\n\nIran also sees the Turkish incursion in the northeast an opportunity for a permanent deal between Assad and the Kurds. Moreover, Tehran aims to seize the moment and try to convince Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to open up to Assad, sighting more legitimacy for his regime on the international stage.\n\nBoth Iran and Russia showed interest in reviving the Adana pact between both sides.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, tweeted earlier this month, prior to the Turkish operation, insisting that: \u201cAchieving peace and fighting terror in Syria will only succeed through respect for its territorial integrity and its people. Adana provides framework for Turkey and Syria \u2013 Iran is ready to help.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Adana pact?\n\nCommonly known as the Adana agreement. It is a security pact signed in 1998 between Turkey and Syria as a legal framework for peacefully establishing security on the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nAccording to the agreement, then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad pledged to shut down the bases of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) \u2013 which Ankara regards a terrorist group \u2013 in Syria and expel its leader Abdullah Ocalan \u2013 who is now in a Turkish jail. The pact has been widely seen as the basis for striking a deal that could lead to Turkey\u2019s military and the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) guarding the Turkish-Syrian border through a coordinated effort.\n\nHow the US sees the new potential arrangement\n\nPresident Trump seems to have no problem with the arrangement. In a tweet this week, Trump said: \u201c...And Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nMazloum Abdi, commander of the SDF, said on Thursday after a phone call with the US president that Trump did not object to an agreement between the Kurdish-led forces and the Syrian government.\n\nThis means recognising Assad\u2019s regime as the legitimate government of Syria, and giving the nod to a future deal between Syria, whose forces will be deployed along the northern borders, and Turkey. Erdogan said on Friday: \u201cI hope our operation will be the beginning of a peaceful settlement in Syria.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s five-day ceasefire agreement in northeast Syria, reached between Erdogan and the US vice president Mike Pence, could be the foundation for the new arrangements.\n\nThis ceasefire agreement means from the US point \u201cvalidating what Turkey did and allowing them to annex a portion of Syria and displace the Kurdish population\u201d, according to a US official, familiar with operations in Syria, who spoke to CNN.\n\nThe future looks bright for Iran and Russia in the area as a result of Trump\u2019s decisions, according to analysts, but rather grim for the US and the west.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull US forces out of Syria, paved the way for Turkey to push the Kurds away from its borders \u2013 but also facilitated a comeback by Iran in one of the most strategic areas in the Middle East.
