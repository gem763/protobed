As many as 1.5million Armenians were rounded up, deported and massacred by their Turkish rulers in the early-20th century massacre. Armenians had clashed with Turks as the Ottoman Empire fell apart in the late 19th century and matters came to a head during World War I. The Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1914, and many Armenians were suspected of supporting the Russian enemy. On April 24, 1915, thousands of Armenians suspected of harbouring nationalist sentiments and being hostile to Ottoman rule were rounded up. On May 26, a special law authorised deportations 'for reasons of internal security'. Armenian orphans are deported in 1915, the year the genocide of 1.5million began The Armenian population of Anatolia and Cilicia, labelled 'the enemy within', was forced into exile in the Mesopotamian desert. A large number were killed on the way or in the detention camps. Many were burned alive, drowned, poisoned or fell victim to disease, according to foreign diplomats and intelligence services at the time. Others starved to death, or were shot or bayoneted by Ottoman Turkish soldiers. Turkey rejects the term 'genocide', questioning the numbers involved and saying there were fatalities on both sides. In 2014, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of 'shared pain' over the killings, but earlier this year he slammed France and Emmanuel Macron for officially commemorating the 'genocide'.", "description": "Kim And Kourtney Kardashian visited the President of Armenia, Armen Sarkissian, and his wife,\u00a0Nune Sarkissian, for dinner at the Presidential palace on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19501992-0-image-a-4_1570639883412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
