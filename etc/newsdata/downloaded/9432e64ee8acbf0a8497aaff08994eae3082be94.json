(AP) - A day after complaining on social media that there were too many penalties in the game he was watching on TV, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady tried to make nice with the NFL referees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pro-ref,\u201d Brady said in the New England locker room on Friday.\n\nBrady was tweeting a different story on Thursday night, when Tennessee and Jacksonville were flagged 15 times in the first half, starting on the very first play from scrimmage. After Titans linebacker Kamalei Correa was called for roughing the passer in the second quarter, Brady posted on Twitter : \u201cToo many penalties. Just let us play!!!!\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, he added in a tweet that has been liked 122,300 times by Friday afternoon: \u201cI\u2019m turning off this game I can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore.\u201d Even broadcaster Troy Aikman seemed to agree with Brady.\n\nAsked about it on Friday, Brady maintained he wasn\u2019t criticizing the officials.\n\n\u201cThe refs always do a good job. I never complain to the refs,\u201d he told reporters crowding around his locker. \u201cYou guys ever hear me complain to the refs?\u201d\n\nYes.\n\nWe.\n\nDo.\n\nHe then added that maybe he has, but only in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe backtracking by one of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars makes sense, because he relies on the officials to protect him when 300-pound defenders are bearing down on him in the pocket. Dolphins linebacker Raekwon McMillan told The Miami Herald that a member of the officiating crew told him after a legal hit on Brady this Sunday, \u201cStay off Tom.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A day after complaining on social media that there were too many penalties in the game he was watching on TV, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady tried to make nice with the NFL referees.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/rams_browns_football_36194_c0-80-1903-1189_s1770x1032.jpg?1240bb1c640d4199f46b7674ef3b14aa6e8766e4", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
