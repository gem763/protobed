So it was long past time for the series to dig into the entertainment industry\u2019s underappreciated, overexploited underclass: The assistants that answer phones, make lunch reservations, and keep weirdos from wandering onto film sets.\n\nWhen Casey McGarry, who leads the strike, meets with big-shot mega-producer Lenny Turtletaub, her demand is simple: Stop treating assistants like garbage. \u201cIt appears we are at an impasse,\u201d shrugs Turteltaub. So the strike is on, bringing the town to a screeching halt and leading Hollywoo into an almost post-apocalyptic collapse.\n\n\u201cThe Kidney Stays in the Picture\u201d is another one of BoJack Horseman\u2019s ensemble pieces, using the assistants\u2019 strike as a backdrop while telling three distinct stories that never really cross over with each other. The first is Turteltaub and Princess Carolyn\u2019s cagey effort to break the strike by promising its leaders that they\u2019ll be promoted out of the drudgery of assistant work and into easy, prestigious jobs in development. It\u2019s a fairly effective strategy, and an appropriately acid-laced nod at the way people tend to put their own professional development over their principles or the collective good when someone hands them a cushy contract.\n\nBut as a couple of flashbacks remind us, Princess Carolyn has also been on the other side of that table, as an assistant exploited by creepy male bosses who keep her on the hook by dangling vague promises about a promotion that never actually seems to arrive. So after a crisis of conscience, she switches sides, telling her own (useless) assistant Stuart not to sign any deal, and bringing in her old (terrifyingly competent) assistant Judah Mannowdog to broker a better deal on behalf of all of the assistants.\n\nMeanwhile, BoJack is outside of the Hollywoo loop, doing his best to get Dr. Champ back on the wagon after accidentally knocking him out of it with a misplaced bottle of vodka. The accidental drink led Dr. Champ to a full-on relapse, slugging down margaritas at BoJack\u2019s old watering hole, Bellican\u2019s. As BoJack tries to play horse therapist to his horse therapist, he has his own rapid-fire psychiatric breakthrough, realizing that he had both an internal and an external hatred of horses following his abusive childhood and his own inescapable self-loathing. But BoJack\u2019s halting progress toward fixing his own problems has, once again, come at the expense of someone else. Not for the first time, BoJack ends up on the receiving end of a rant about his uncanny knack for ruining the lives of anybody who cares about him. But this time, at least, BoJack is doing his earnest best to help, checking Dr. Champ into a different rehab facility with the hopes of helping his therapist get his own life back on track.\n\nThe third story, as Todd himself describes it, is a goofy whimsical mess-around. Todd\u2019s stepfather Jorge shows up on Todd\u2019s doorstep, revealing that Todd\u2019s mother is in a coma and desperately in need of a kidney donation. Unfortunately, Todd has just sold his kidney to Jeremiah Whitewhale in exchange for enough money to buy some sock puppets to entertain Ruthie. So Todd and Jorge are off to Chicago to storm the Whitewhale building and get the kidney back (with a major assist from Diane, who will do anything to avoid working on the memoir that\u2019s been going so poorly).\n\nThe mission itself is your normal delightful Todd nonsense, but the show is also making a much clearer effort to be as sharp on the subject of race as it is on everything else. Several writers, including Vulture\u2019s own E. Alex Jung, have accurately criticized BoJack Horseman for being weak on the subject of race, and series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg has acknowledged that it has historically been one of the show\u2019s biggest flaws.\n\nIf \u201cThe Kidney Stays in the Picture\u201d isn\u2019t a full corrective, it\u2019s at least an acknowledgment of one of BoJack Horseman\u2019s biggest blind spots. When Todd fails to fool a security guard at the Whitewhale building, Jorge just pretends to be a night custodian and speaks to the uncomprehending guard in Spanish, confident \u2014 correctly \u2014 that the guard will eventually just throw up his hands, take him at his word, and let him into the building. Later, when Todd and Jorge finally find the kidney, they get caught by a guard \u2014 who is utterly charmed by Todd\u2019s antics, letting Todd go after warmly referring to him as a scamp. Jorge, who was hard on Todd when he was growing up, realizes that the tough-love approach wasn\u2019t actually a necessary survival skill for his stepson: \u201cI should have realized: You\u2019re white.\u201d (\u201cI forgive you,\u201d replies Todd, cheerfully oblivious to the darker moral of Jorge\u2019s revelation.)\n\nIs this enough to atone for BoJack Horseman\u2019s missteps on race in its earlier seasons? That\u2019s up to each individual viewer. (For what it\u2019s worth, Bob-Waksberg has also said he feels like he\u2019s gotten too much praise as a white person who merely acknowledges the existence of the problem.) But at the very least, it\u2019s refreshing to see a series as long-lived as BoJack Horseman actually recognize legitimate criticism, and do its best \u2014 even at this relatively late hour in the series \u2014 to work toward fixing it.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 The revelation that Todd has adopted Jorge\u2019s last name is another wrinkle in BoJack Horseman\u2019s greater reckoning with its initial \u201ccolorblind casting.\u201d For most of BoJack Horseman\u2019s run, it hasn\u2019t even been clear whether Todd was white or Latinx. For more on that subject, read this 2018 interview with series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg and star Aaron Paul.\n\n\u2022 Princess Carolyn\u2019s little scheme \u2014 \u201cWe satiate TV creators by giving them little vanity cards at the end of episodes, then sell the shows to streaming networks that auto-skip the end credits so no one even sees the vanity cards\u201d \u2014 feels particularly pointed for a Netflix series (and for a show on which I frequently need to scramble for the remote to keep the credits running before the Netflix app jumps ahead).\n\n\u2022 Highlights from the news ticker on MSNBSea: \u201cAnti-vaxx actress claims there are no small parts, only small children with smallpox\u201d; \u201cControversial new film casts white zebra with black stripes to play black zebra with white stripes.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The full breakdown of what Jorge says the name \u201cChavez\u201d represents: Cerebral, High-Minded, Analytical, Voracious, Efficacious, and Zealously Practical.\n\n\u2022 Todd\u2019s sock-puppet tribute to Ang Lee gets cut off during a particularly wrenching scene between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway in Brokeback Mountain.\n\n\u2022 Charley Witherspoon, the failing-up-the-ladder son of Princess Carolyn\u2019s former boss \u2014 who makes his first appearance since season four in a cameo at the beginning of the episode \u2014 is voiced by Raphael Bob-Waksberg.\n\n\u2022 And the brief flashback to Princess Carolyn\u2019s assistant days features Paul F. Tompkins (who also voices Mr. Peanutbutter) as her disgusting male-chauvinist boss Marv.\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
