Six inspiring women are transforming traditional notions by making it possible for those not typically considered \u201cJapanese\u201d to have a voice.\n\nSometimes it seems like Japanese women and femmes share the exact same characteristics. This is, of course, a myth, but in the face of pervasive kawaii culture, the overwhelming social pressure to be thin, and the uniformity of idol groups like AKB48, it\u2019s not hard to see how this damaging idea gets perpetuated.\n\nThe \u201cideal Japanese woman\u201d is relentlessly depicted as adorable, fashionable, organized, submissive, straight, soft-spoken (think lovable Japanese darling, Marie Kondo), and above all else, of pure Japanese descent. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with this image, painting it as the definition for all Japanese women is.\n\nDespite this, these six modern women are evolving on the work of the renowned women who helped shape Japan\u2019s history by shaking up the stereotype and redefining what it means to be Japanese.\n\n1. Naomi Osaka: The title-winning tennis star representing Japan\n\n\u00a9 Photo by Naomi Osaka\n\nFlip on the TV and nine out of ten times you\u2019ll see a commercial featuring professional tennis player Naomi Osaka.\n\nRepresenting Japan, Osaka has risen to worldwide stardom in recent years for her mad skills on the court. At just 22 years old, she\u2019s the first Asian player to hold a top rank in the tennis singles category. In 2018, Osaka shocked the world when she defeated her idol Serena Williams in a controversial match.\n\nOsaka was born in Osaka (of course) but moved to the US when she was three, so she holds dual citizenship. However, because she lacks the pale complexion typical of Asian women\u2014her mother is Japanese and her father Haitian\u2014Osaka has received both praise and hate from her native country.\n\nView this post on Instagram full circle A post shared by \u5927\u5742\u306a\u304a\u307f (@naomiosaka) on Oct 15, 2019 at 10:48pm PDT\n\nAn animated ad created by Japanese noodle giant Nissin features a whitewashed version of Osaka. Despite Nissin apologizing and claiming they meant no harm, the ad caused quite the controversy. More recently, a Japanese comedic duo joked her skin \u201cneeded some bleach.\u201d Naomi\u2019s excellent Twitter response proves one can care about beauty without being superficial\u2014or racist.\n\nIt\u2019s as if, in order for Osaka to be accepted into Japanese society, some people are trying to change her appearance to force her to fit in. Yet, despite the hate, Osaka has won four titles, continues to be a strong representative of Japan in the world of sports, and is still kicking ass both on the court and in life.\n\n2. Rina Sawayama: The fashion-forward pop star giving a voice to queer Japanese women\n\n\u00a9 Photo by Risa Sawayama\n\nRepresenting bi and pansexual women everywhere is Rina Sawayama, a singer-songwriter and model who was born in Niigata and raised in London.\n\nThe rising pop star pens songs with powerful, feminist lyrics featuring beats evoking the playful nostalgia of the 90s and early 2000s. Sporting colorful hairstyles (including her trademark orange mane) and fusing genres like pop, rock, and R&B, Sawayama shuns the image of the typical Japanese girl.\n\nHer rise to fame came in 2017 when she independently released an album called RINA exploring themes like social anxiety, how people portray themselves online, and pop music\u2019s lack of Asian representation. She gained further popularity in the form of the LGBT+ community when she came out as bi/pansexual in 2018. She\u2019s since been named one of Forbes Japan\u2019s 30 Under 30.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Rina Sawayama (@rinasonline) on Mar 22, 2019 at 6:06am PDT\n\nSawayama is outspoken about Asian beauty standards. In an interview with Vogue Magazine, she explains, \u201cFor a lot of women in Japan, these are the expectations people put on them, from anime culture, kawaii culture\u2026that can really put women at a disadvantage, objectifying and infantilizing them.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, she criticized this very issue in a collaboration with photographer John Yuyi for a series of portraits titled Asian Beauty. Sawayama posed for the camera, showcasing an anime-style eye with a double eyelid and text referencing the desire for pale skin painted on her bare skin. By regularly calling out behavior she views as harmful, Sawayama continues to bring to light discrimination and pioneer the future of Japanese beauty.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Sawayama is already breaking the mold. As she intones in \u201cTake Me As I Am\u201d:\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s okay\n\nTo keep up the status quo\n\nWell, that ain\u2019t no more.\u201d\n\n3. Ariana Miyamoto: The former Miss Universe Japan who uses her platform to fight racial discrimination\n\n\u00a9 Photo by Ariana Miyamoto\n\nAnother inspirational biracial woman is Ariana Miyamoto, a Japanese model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Universe Japan in 2015.\n\nLike Osaka, Miyamoto is half-Japanese (her father is African-American). Unfortunately, she too has been subjected to racist and colorist backlash by those who don\u2019t believe someone who isn\u2019t fully of Japanese descent can represent the nation.\n\nThe difference between Osaka and Miyamoto, however, is that Miyamoto grew up almost entirely in Japan, solely holds Japanese citizenship, and speaks the language fluently. She knows no other nation better than she knows Japan, her home.\n\nMiyamoto was inspired to compete in the Miss Universe pageant after a Japanese friend who was also biracial committed suicide. She realized she could potentially use her fame to combat racial prejudice, so she auditioned.\n\nView this post on Instagram \u7740\u7269\u4e45\u3057\u3076\u308a\u306b\u6765\u305f\u30fc\u2764\ufe0e #love#\u7740\u7269#kimono @ayako_cosmopolitan A post shared by Ariana Miyamoto (@arianastan) on Oct 12, 2016 at 4:29am PDT\n\nNot only did Miyamoto best every other Japanese contestant to become Miss Universe Japan, but she also made it into the top 10 during the global Miss Universe pageant later that year. This capitulated her into international stardom, allowing her to directly challenge the outdated notion that Japanese people have to look a certain way. The once-shy Miyamoto no longer minds drawing attention to herself if it inspires other Japanese people of color to aim for success.\n\n\u201cNow I have a great platform to deliver that message as the first black Miss Universe Japan,\u201d she said.\n\n4. Megumi Nishikura: Film director and producer introducing the struggles of hafus to an international audience\n\nFew Japanese people are more familiar with the trials and tribulations of hafu (someone born to one Japanese and one non-Japanese parent) life as Megumi Nishikura. A Japanese-Irish filmmaker raised between Japan and the US, Nishikura received worldwide acclaim for her 2013 film Hafu.\n\n\u201cIf you are in [Tokyo], you will see many hafus and interracial couples. But I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why Japanese society doesn\u2019t know the true feelings and struggles of hafus\u2026\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Japan to accept diversity.\u201d\n\nWorking with fellow hafu Lara Perez Takagi, Nishikura set out to depict the experiences of five half-Japanese individuals and how they\u2019ve been affected by their identities. Besides being directed by and starring hafu, many of the film\u2019s key creative elements were contributed by hafu artists as well.\n\nThe film helped bring to light the issues hafus in Japan face, as well as the fact that a growing number of children born in Japan are biracial, a fact the nation will have to reckon with sooner than later.\n\nNishikura continues to use film as a medium to remind people of their common humanity. She has collaborated with the United Nations and NGOs to create documentaries on social issues.\n\n5. Naomi Watanabe: Proving to the world that one size does not fit all\n\n\u00a9 Photo by Naomi Watanabe\n\nNamed one of Time Magazine\u2019s \u201c25 Most Influential People on the Internet\u201d in 2018, Naomi Watanabe is poised for international stardom.\n\nThe Japanese-Taiwanese comedian, actress, and fashion designer rose to fame in 2008 for her televised imitation of Beyonc\u00e9 on popular variety show Warate Iitomo! She is now Japan\u2019s most-followed person on Instagram.\n\nWatanabe is undeniably hilarious, but what often initially draws people\u2019s attention is the fact that she\u2019s bigger and curvier than most Japanese women. She expertly uses this to her advantage, like in her hilarious Shu Uemura campaign where she presses cosmetics up against the glass with her curvaceous body. Though she has experienced body shaming and criticism online and beyond, Watanabe retains a positive attitude and regularly preaches the value of body positivity and self-love.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by \u6e21\u8fba\u76f4\u7f8e (@watanabenaomi703) on Jul 3, 2019 at 2:16am PDT\n\nShe said: \u201cIf you love yourself, you can try anything.\u201d\n\nIn everything she does, Watanabe is spreading the idea that curvy girls can be sexy, successful, and happy\u2014and proudly boast it, too. As she said in an interview with Vogue UK, \u201cI definitely think that it\u2019s important to change the stereotype: Japanese women do have opinions; we are not going to say yes all the time or agree to everything. I want to just to be seen as an individual.\u201d\n\n6. Shiori Ito: A brave journalist and filmmaker who\u2019s not afraid to speak out\n\n\u00a9 Photo by @valentina98433\n\nShiori Ito is a renowned journalist and filmmaker. Her films, which mainly focus on gender-based human rights issues, have won her international accolades and praise. As a journalist, she reports to and contributes articles to publications like Al Jazeera, Politico, and Reuters.\n\nIn 2017, she shocked the nation by publicly accusing a prominent fellow journalist with ties to the Prime Minister of raping her. She chose to be verbal about the attack after the police refused to press charges against the man, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, despite there being substantial evidence against him.\n\nIn a country known for lax rape laws and victim-blaming, the backlash was devastating. \u201cI was vilified on social media and received hate messages and emails and calls from unknown numbers\u2026and told I should \u2018be dead\u2019,\u201d Ito wrote. \u201cThere were arguments over my nationality because a true Japanese woman wouldn\u2019t speak about such \u2018shameful\u2019 things.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram #shioriito #blackbox Be brave and be with u all. A post shared by \u5341\u516b\u7237 (@hidoggy) on Jul 18, 2019 at 10:24pm PDT\n\nMany people rallied behind her, however. Ito became the subject of an acclaimed BBC documentary called Japan\u2019s Secret Shame, which made waves internationally. She also wrote a book called Black Box revealing the sexism in Japan\u2019s society and institutions.\n\nThe \u201cideal\u201d Japanese woman is viewed as shy, quiet, and told not to make a scene\u2014quite the opposite of what Ito is doing. Her decision to speak out has opened up a difficult but necessary dialogue, and is encouraging other Japanese women to follow in her footsteps.\n\nWho are the women of today\u2019s Japan who inspire you?
