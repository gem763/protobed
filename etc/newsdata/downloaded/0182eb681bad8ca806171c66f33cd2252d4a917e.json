Does That Make Him Gore\u2014or Reagan?", "language": "en", "text": "Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images 2020 Biden\u2019s a Gaffe Machine. Does That Make Him Gore\u2014or Reagan? In 2000, a presidential candidate\u2019s verbal flubs were devastating. In 1980, an old man\u2019s goofs were irrelevant. How Biden runs his campaign could determine the difference in 2020.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.\n\nHe was a study in stumbles. He blamed trees for air pollution, could not remember the basics of his tax proposals, claimed to have witnessed the liberation of concentration camps, told an affecting story of World War II heroism that was in fact a scene from a movie. And this track record was so devastating that in November 1980, he won 44 states and 489 electoral votes against an incumbent president.\n\nJoe Biden might take comfort from Ronald Reagan\u2019s invulnerability as he contends with political reporters who have made his slips of the tongue and memory a near-daily story. No, he wasn\u2019t vice president when he met with survivors of the Parkland shooting; yes, he confused former Prime Minister Theresa May with Margaret Thatcher; no, the shootings he talked about did not happen in Houston and Michigan; yes, he conflated several different medals ceremonies into one moving, inaccurate account. Maybe all this will matter to the Democratic voters\u2014and to the general public\u2014as little as Reagan\u2019s confusions and misstatements mattered 40 years ago.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo the logical question for Biden\u2019s campaign is: Why didn\u2019t Reagan\u2019s stumbles matter? After all, when he ran in 1980 his age was a significant issue. At 69, Reagan was running to be the oldest president ever inaugurated (how times change!). The key for Reagan\u2019s success was that by 1980, the Republican Party knew and embraced him as the campaign of their conservative beliefs. He\u2019d come onto the national stage 16 years earlier with a memorable TV speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater. He\u2019d served for eight years as governor of the most populous state in the nation. He\u2019d nearly unseated the Republican president in 1976 with a challenge from the right that came within a few dozen delegates of success. In the simplest of terms, they knew who he was.\n\nA faulty statistic, or a slip of the tongue, or a memory lapse wasn\u2019t going to change their minds about their political hero. And by general election time, the combination of inflation, an industrial recession, and the American hostages in Iran was more than enough to persuade the broader electorate to vote for change.\n\nAs the 2020 campaign begins in earnest, it\u2019s not at all clear that Biden fits this pattern. He has certainly been around long enough for Democrats to find him a comfortable fit. His \u201cblue-collar Joe\u201d demeanor, his affinity, his empathy with the victims of life\u2019s hardest blows are considerable assets. But there is one significant difference: Reagan embodied the Republican Party\u2019s values and ideology in 1980.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Democratic Party foot soldier in the progressive camp in 2019, you\u2019ve got serious problems with Biden on everything from health care to immigration to his work on the crime bills of the 1980s and 1990s. In a time when the Democratic Party is considerably different from what it was in the era of Bill Clinton or even Barack Obama, the inclination among Democrats to brush aside slips on the campaign trail is, to put it mildly, limited.\n\nThat, in turn, raises the possibility that Biden isn\u2019t Reagan. What if he\u2019s Al Gore?\n\nIn 2000, Vice President Gore sailed to the Democratic nomination. After a fairly close win in New Hampshire, Gore saw his only rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, more or less disappear. With nearly a quarter century in public life, including eight years as vice president, Gore was a known commodity. But as the campaign progressed, Gore became pilloried by a press corps that subjected his every statement to a withering examination of its accuracy.\n\nAs columnist Paul Waldman would later write in The American Prospect, \u201cWith the possible exception of Barry Goldwater 36 years before, no presidential candidate in the television age has been treated with the kind of naked contempt reporters heaped on Gore during his 2000 run. While they portrayed George W. Bush as an honest and genial fellow who was \u2018comfortable in his own skin\u2019 if not the sharpest tool in the shed, Gore was ridiculed as a liar and a phony whose very desire to be president was disqualifying in and of itself.\u201d He was ridiculed for having claimed to \u201cinvent\u201d the Internet. (He hadn\u2019t said that, though he did say he \u201ctook the initiative in creating it\u201d while in Congress.) He was attacked for claiming to have discovered the Love Canal environmental disaster. (He hadn\u2019t, though he did say that his congressional hearings on the event, which were the first, \u201cstarted it all.\u201d) He\u2019d claimed to have traveled with the Federal Emergency Management Agency director to storm-ravaged Texas (He\u2019d been with him on a different trip).\n\nWhat drove this intense criticism was more personal than mere truth-squadding: It was a sense that there was something arrogant, even supercilious, about Gore\u2019s demeanor, and it made the press anxious to knock Gore off his pedestal. In drawing a distinction between the two candidates in 2000, it has been frequently said, \u201cBush speaks English as if it\u2019s his second language; Gore speaks English as though it\u2019s your second language.\u201d (And it didn\u2019t help that Gore, unlike Reagan, was not beloved by his party\u2019s most ideological members.)\n\nPolitical reporters don\u2019t seem to loathe Biden, even if they do tend to think he\u2019s a blowhard. But even when a candidate isn\u2019t hated by the press, enough misstatements can begin to form a template for coverage. It happened to George Romney as the 1968 campaign began, when he explained his change of heart on Vietnam by stating he\u2019d been \u201cbrainwashed.\u201d Romney quickly became the target of relentless coverage that focused on every plausible inconsistency. The quip among the press was that every story contained a paragraph beginning, \u201cRomney later explained \u2026 .\u201d And it happened to Dan Quayle, whose deer-in-the-headlights debut as a vice presidential candidate in 1988 defined him as a not-ready-for-prime-time player. (Misspelling \u201cpotato\u201d at a spelling bee in a New Jersey public school did not help).\n\nThe impulse to define the 76-year-old Biden by his verbal slips hasn\u2019t become the dominant theme of coverage, and his appearance at CNN\u2019s climate-change town hall this week and at ABC\u2019s debate next week could go a long way to lessen\u2014or strengthen\u2014that impulse. But the danger is there for his campaign, especially if the press begins to try to find a stumble even when there isn\u2019t one. At a town hall in Hanover, New Hampshire, late last month Biden asked the younger members of his audience to try to imagine how they would have felt if President Barack Obama had been assassinated. It was an attempt to explain to them what it felt like to lose Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy in an eight-week span in 1968. The New York Times in particular seemed to treat the comment as something close to bizarre.\n\nAnd this raises a perhaps more serious danger for Biden. Should he win the Democratic presidential nomination, his missteps may serve to lessen the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s manifold falsehoods. In a sense, they would serve the same political role that Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual misconduct did in 2016 in saving Trump from the full consequences of his language and his conduct. There is no equivalence between Biden\u2019s words and Trump\u2019s relentless outpouring of falsehoods and outright lies, but if enough of the voting public sees such an equivalence, or if the press begins to regard them similarly, it could make a profound political difference.\n\nIt would be unfair, but as JFK once said about life, politics is unfair. And if Biden wants his mistakes to fade into Reagan-like irrelevance, his most important task is to give Democratic voters a reason beyond his political longevity to support him.", "description": "In 2000, a presidential candidate\u2019s verbal flubs were devastating.
