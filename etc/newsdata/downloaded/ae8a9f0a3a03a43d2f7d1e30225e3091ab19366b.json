GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares firm as \"very good\" trade talks boost risk appetite\n\n* MSCI Asia ex-Japan +0.5%; Nikkei +0.9%\n\n* Pound eases after rallying on Brexit hopes\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Andrew Galbraith\n\nSHANGHAI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Asian shares and U.S. stock\n\nfutures rose on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he\n\nwould meet with China's top trade negotiator, while sterling\n\nretreated after rallying on revived hopes of a possible Brexit\n\ndeal.\n\nInvestors' renewed appetite for riskier assets weighed on\n\nthe safe-haven yen and U.S. Treasury prices, while oil\n\nstayed firm on comments about possible supply cuts from the head\n\nof OPEC.\n\nIn early Asian trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific\n\nshares outside Japan rose 0.5%, following on\n\nfrom gains on Wall Street. S&P e-mini futures added 0.2%.\n\nAustralian shares climbed 0.8%, while Japan's Nikkei\n\nstock index gained 0.9%.\n\nThe more bullish market mood came after a first day of trade\n\ntalks between top U.S. and Chinese negotiators that Trump\n\ncharacterised as \"very, very good.\"\n\nA White House official said the talks had gone \"probably\n\nbetter than expected\" and a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official\n\nbriefed by both sides raised the possibility of a currency\n\nagreement this week. \"Freezing tariffs at current levels are unlikely to reverse\n\nthe current trade driven slowdown in economic growth, and the\n\nuncertainty around unresolved structural issues such as IP theft\n\nand subsidies to state own enterprises are likely to remain\n\ndeterrents for a pick-up in much needed capital expenditure,\"\n\nanalysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note.\n\n\"On this score details on a potential currency pact will be\n\nimportant,\" they said.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.1% against the yen to 108.07 , while\n\nthe euro was flat at $1.1004 and the pound was slightly lower,\n\nfetching $1.2432.\n\nThe dollar index , which tracks the greenback against\n\na basket of six major rivals, was down at 98.663 after posting\n\nits biggest daily drop in five weeks on waning safe-haven demand\n\nfor the currency.\n\nThe British pound jumped nearly 2% on Thursday, its biggest\n\ndaily gain since March, after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar\n\nsaid a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October after\n\nwhat he called a very positive meeting with his British\n\ncounterpart, Boris Johnson. The move away from safe havens also lifted the yield on\n\nbenchmark 10-year Treasury notes to 1.6716% compared\n\nwith a U.S. close of 1.656% on Thursday. Yields rose across the\n\ncurve, with two-year notes yielding 1.5464% compared\n\nwith a U.S. close of 1.53%.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices remained higher after the\n\nhead of OPEC said the organisation could take action to balance\n\noil markets, including a deeper cut in oil supplies.\n\nU.S. crude was up 0.43% to $53.78 a barrel and global\n\nbenchmark Brent crude was up 0.46% at $59.37 per barrel.\n\nRising risk appetite tarnished gold's appeal, pushing spot\n\ngold down 0.16% to $1,491.65 per ounce.
