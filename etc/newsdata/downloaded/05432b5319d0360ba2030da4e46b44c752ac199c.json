Bringing him or her forward after repeated attacks by Trump would only put the whistleblower\u2019s safety at risk, they said.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-standing concern that the president and his allies in Congress aren\u2019t interested in the underlying act but are interested in risking the life of the whistleblower,\u201d Representative Eric Swalwell told reporters.\n\nGovernment personnel have been assigned to protect the whistleblower, according to sources familiar with the matter, after Trump has attacked the whistleblower and conservative news outlets and social-media activists speculated about the individual\u2019s identity.\n\nAs many as five possible names for the whistleblower have circulated in political circles, according to sources familiar with efforts to protect the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cSuch behavior is at the pinnacle of irresponsibility and is intentionally reckless,\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nIn a closed-door hearing on Tuesday, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff cut off a Republican line of questioning of a witness, Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, objecting that it was designed to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nRepublicans said they were trying to figure out who Vindman had spoken with after Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in a July 25 phone call.\n\nThey said they do not aim to publicly reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity but need to assess his or her motivations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to determine someone\u2019s credibility if you can\u2019t put them under oath and ask them questions,\u201d Republican Representative Jim Jordan told reporters.\n\nAfter Vindman\u2019s testimony, Schiff accused Trump and his allies of seeking to \u201cout,\u201d or reveal the identity of, the whistleblower and insisted that his committee will not allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cWe will make every effort to make sure that notwithstanding the president or his allies\u2019 desire to out and exact political revenge on this whistleblower, that our committee is never used for that purpose,\u201d Schiff said in a brief statement to reporters, not responding to questions.\n\nIn previous sessions, Republicans have asked witnesses whether they know the person they suspect to be the whistleblower and inquired about possible motives, according to a congressional aide.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s lawyers have told congressional investigators their client is only interested in answering written questions.", "description": "Republican and Democratic lawmakers clashed on Tuesday over questions about the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint led to the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Mark Hosenball", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
