An expected improvement this summer has not happened.\n\nCui Dongshu, the secretary general of the Chinese Passenger Car Association, said September at least was not as bad as some recent months. \u201cThe sales are recovering but very slowly, due to weak consumption,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purchasing power of families is still not enough.\u201d\n\nChinese automakers had planned to export a lot of cars to the United States starting this winter. But Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have made that much harder and have prompted one carmaker, Guangzhou Auto, to suspend indefinitely its plans to enter the American market.\n\nProperty market weakness has also pinched growth, hurting consumer sentiment. A decades-long run-up in home prices gave many in China, where the homeownership rate is high, the feeling that they were becoming prosperous enough to splurge on other purchases. But prices have mostly stabilized, and even fallen in some smaller cities, and many families are struggling with large mortgage payments.\n\nChina\u2019s biggest challenge may be slower investment, which weakened further in September. Although state-owned enterprises continue to pour money into new projects, foreign investment has faltered, especially in September; some companies are diversifying away from China.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a significant divestment by multinationals in this part of the world in the past 18 months,\u201d said Mark Webster, a partner in the Shanghai office of BDA Partners, a New York investment bank that specializes in Asia deals.", "description": "The U.S. trade war is only part of the problem, as Beijing grapples with weakening investment and falling car sales.", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/business/17chinaecon1-print/17chinaecon-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
