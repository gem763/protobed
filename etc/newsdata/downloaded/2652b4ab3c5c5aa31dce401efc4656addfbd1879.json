It's the hardest race on the planet, but for me it's a way of pushing the limit for better - like TGR [tagline] says, but it's the same from the driver's point of view.\"\n\n\"This is the hardest challenge I ever took in my career.\"\n\nAlonso, who will be co-driven by five-time Dakar bike winner Marc Coma, understands he still has plenty to learn ahead of the start in Jeddah for the maiden Middle Eastern Dakar on January 5.\n\nAlonso to compete in Dakar Rally with Toyota More\n\nHe told Autosport.com: \"In my case, reading the terrain, the obstacles, where to pass them sometimes.\n\n\"The dunes too, I have to have a bit more rhythm, more speed and never get stuck.\n\n\"With Marc [Coma, co-driver], the more kilometres we do, the better we will be, because it is also new for him.\n\n\"It is not that he is a co-driver who has years and years of experience inside the car, so little by little we are getting better.\"\n\nIn preparation for January's 12-day event, Alonso is expected to tackle a Saudi Arabian national event, the Ulma Rally (November 4-9).\n\nHe is also likely to start Abu Dhabi's premier cross-country event in December.\n\nGiven the Dakar organisers's decision to ban testing in Saudi Arabia ahead of the event, both rallies are expected to be busy with crews cramming in as much mileage ahead of the marathon January event.\n\nThe former World Endurance Champion will be joined in the South African-based TGR squad by last year's winner Nasser Al Attiyah, former winner Giniel de Villiers and Bernhard Ten Brinke.\n\nFollowing Toyota's announcement in Salou on Thursday, the team will spend Friday and Saturday testing in the hills of Tarragona, inland from the Costa Daurada.\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Two-time Formula 1 world champion Fernando Alonso has confirmed he will compete at January's Dakar with Toyota Gazoo Racing", "authors": ["David Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LaFhi0TpDakCFSei2ns9tw--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/e15779209aa4cd82603bbbd44f6813e4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
