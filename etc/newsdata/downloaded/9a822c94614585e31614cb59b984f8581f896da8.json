As Trysta Krick details, Washington is brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nNow President Donald Trump knows what it\u2019s like to be a professional athlete. And pretty much every one of his predecessors, too.\n\nThere was much consternation and even more navel-gazing Monday about fans serenading Trump with boos and chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d during Game 5 of the World Series. Some saw it as a rightful comeuppance for Trump, who has made similar chants a de facto soundtrack of his appearances and campaign rallies, while others saw it as disheartening confirmation of the polarization of our society.\n\nThat\u2019s overthinking it and, quite frankly, overreacting. Fans boo. It might not be printed on the ticket, but fans believe the price of admission includes a right to express themselves about pretty much anything that goes on at the ballpark, stadium or arena. They whistle, jeer and taunt, and no one \u2013 players, coaches, other fans, even mascots \u2013is immune.\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended Game 5 of the World Series, and did not receive a warm reception from fans in Washington.

Santa Claus!\n\nTo think Trump would be spared that kind of reception, or be outraged that he wasn't, is either na\u00efve or sanctimonious. To say he was singled out unfairly, then-candidate Bill Clinton was roundly booed at a NASCAR race in 1992. The boo birds were out in force for Barack Obama at the All-Star Game in 2009 \u2013 though he might have brought some of that on himself by wearing a White Sox jacket in St. Louis.\n\nLabor Day weekend 1992: With a \"No Draft Dodger For President\" banner flying overhead, Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton is loudly booed by tens of thousands of NASCAR fans pic.twitter.com/wgJAWOfSqL \u2014 Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) October 28, 2019\n\nAnd in the very same stadium where Trump\u2019s appearance on the Jumbotron prompted loud and sustained boos, George W. Bush was jeered in 2008, when he threw out the first pitch at Nationals Park.\n\nOPINION: President Trump's World Series visit may be his last \u2013 for good reason\n\nAnd to argue fans' treatment of Trump was mean-spirited or crossed some bright line, it paled in comparison to the worst of the abuse that's directed at players.\n\nDuring the ALCS earlier this month, New York Yankees fans mocked Astros starter Zack Greinke about his battles with social anxiety and depression. Indianapolis Colts fans booed Andrew Luck after learning the oft-injured quarterback was retiring. The Utah Jazz banned a fan for life last season after Russell Westbrook said the man had made \u201cracial and inappropriate comments\u201d to him. Also last season, the New England Patriots banned a fan who poured a beer on Kansas City receiver Tyreek Hill.\n\nAnd two years ago, Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones endured what he called one of the worst cases of abuse of his career during a game at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park. Jones said he was \u201ccalled the N-word a handful of times tonight,\u201d and pelted with a bag of peanuts.\n\nSo in the grand scheme of things, Trump got off easy. He\u2019s not the first president to be booed, and he wasn\u2019t even the only person Sunday to be booed. Maybe it is a Rorschach test for our society, but not in the way pundits are trying to frame it. Much like peanuts and Cracker Jack, boos and jeers are just a part of the game.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Angst over President Trump's reception at the World Series ignores the fact that fans have long history of booing presidents  at sporting events.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
