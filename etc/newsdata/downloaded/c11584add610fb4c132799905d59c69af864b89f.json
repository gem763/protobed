And our children continue to fall further and further behind their international peers.\n\n\"Many American students who were already low-achieving are worse off today, while our best-performing students have plateaued. Those near the bottom -- our most vulnerable -- have fallen even further behind.\"\n\nMath scores for fourth and eight graders also were little changed, as the younger pupils averaged 1 point better than in 2017 and the junior high students averaged 1 points worse.\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\n\"Over the past decade, there has been no progress in either mathematics or reading performance. The lowest performing students -- those readers who struggle the most -- have made no progress in reading from the first NAEP administration almost 30 years ago,\" said Peggy Carr, the associate commissioner for the National Center for Education Statistics, according to a tweet from the NAEP.\n\nDeVos criticized \"Big Ed\" during her remarks, blaming much of the educational failure on the federal government's involvement in the education system.\n\n\"More rules and more regulations. More staff and more standards. More spending and more strings,\" DeVos said. \"But, as the numbers in today's Report Card reaffirm, students and teachers have gained precious little as a result.\"\n\nSome of DeVos' signature platforms during her time in the administration has been promoting school choice and Education Freedom Scholarships.\n\nWhen discussing the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, DeVos said the law \"invites each state to determine their standards and develop innovative assessments that focus on achievement and excellence.\"\n\n\"States can also set aside a certain percentage of federal taxpayer funding to use in new and creative ways,\" she added. \"There's a student-centered funding pilot program for dollars to support students -- not buildings. I like to picture kids with backpacks representing funding for their education following them wherever they go to learn. States should embrace the freedom in ESSA and look for ways to extend that freedom to empower teachers, parents and students themselves.\"", "description": "A national academic achievement test released on Wednesday revealed that 4th grade and 8th graders\u2019 average reading scores in 2019 declined compared to 2017 results.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/betsy-devos-ap-jef-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
