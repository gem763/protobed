Mark Sanford, who announced this week he is challenging President Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2020, on Monday pushed back against the notion that an intraparty challenge would be damaging for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe American way is premised on competition, and political parties are only made better by competition,\u201d Mr. Sanford, a former South Carolina governor, said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the party would be made stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the eventual nominee would be made stronger by a robust debate of ideas, rather than simply saying, we picked our horse, we\u2019re sticking with it, and we\u2019ll see what happens come next November.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanford on Monday declined to say who he would vote for if Mr. Trump does secure the GOP nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll worry about it when I get there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an idea guy \u2014 I believe in ideas, and I\u2019m going to pick the candidate that\u2019s closest to what I believe in confronting this financial storm that\u2019s coming our way.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanford joined former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh as the most prominent Republicans mounting long-shot bids for the White House in 2020.\n\nMr. Trump has labeled the trio the \u201cThree Stooges.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanford announced he is entering the race just as state Republican parties in places like South Carolina, Nevada and Kansas have moved to cancel or curtail their 2020 nominating contests.\n\nCritics have said they\u2019re trying to limit competition and are serving to protect a flawed candidate, but the parties have pointed to expected cost savings and past precedent of both parties moving to cancel their presidential nominating contests when they have an incumbent president running for reelection.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
