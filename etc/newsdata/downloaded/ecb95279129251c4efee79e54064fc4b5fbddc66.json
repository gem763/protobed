He died in 1967.\n\nThe shah returned immediately after the ousting to rule Iran for nearly three decades, before he was then overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nTogether with Oscar-winning editor Walter Murch, Amirani uses never-seen-before archival footage, interviews with historical figures and new research to forensically examine the events.\n\n\u201cLike all counter-intelligence stuff there\u2019s a lot of smoke drifting over the tracks of who did what when,\u201d said Murch, whose credits include \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d movies.\n\n\u201cBut the film really does throw a lightning bolt across that landscape that makes it very clear what was going on.\u201d\n\nThe pair stumbled upon a 1980s British TV documentary which had identified and interviewed a former MI6 operative named Norman Darbyshire, who admitted helping mastermind the coup.\n\nThe now-deceased Darbyshire is conspicuously absent from the programme that aired, with suggestions the British government may have intervened to have him omitted.\n\nAmirani discovered a transcript of his interview with the documentary makers, and enlists Oscar-nominated actor Ralph Fiennes to play the ex-spy in a re-enacted interview.\n\n\u201cThe actual running of the coup from our side was my responsibility,\u201d Fiennes recounts Darbyshire saying.\n\nBritain\u2019s Foreign Office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Hopes and dreams\u2019 \u2013\n\nFor Amirani, 59, making a film about Mossadegh\u2019s overthrow felt \u201cas personal as it can get\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a kid I lived through the consequences of the coup that gave rise to the shah\u2019s rule for 25 years,\u201d he said.\n\nHis interest was piqued after seeing pictures of the long-deposed prime minister at pro-democracy protests in Iran in 2009.\n\nThat resonated with a deeply-held sense that the country\u2019s recent history could have been radically different had Mossadegh remained in power.\n\n\u201cHe, for many including myself, presented the hopes and dreams of a democratic secular Iran,\u201d Amirani said.\n\nDuring his decade-long quest to make \u201cCoup 53\u201d, relations between Iran and the West deteriorated markedly, with a 2015 nuclear deal unravelling and rising military frictions in the region.\n\nTensions between Tehran and London also increased due to the detention of several British-Iranian dual nationals and, more recently, the seizure of oil tankers by both sides.\n\nAmirani said he could feel history repeating itself.\n\n\u201cEverything that happened in \u201953 was unfolding in the news headlines during our editing,\u201d said Amirani.\n\n\u201cThe relevance of this film grew more and more the longer we spent making (it),\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhat the film can tell us is what (former US President) Harry Truman said: \u2018there is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know\u2019,\u201d Amirani recounted.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Filmmaker Taghi Amirani calls them the documents that changed the fate of his country, casting light on Britain\u2019s role in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/2db520_iranian-taghi-amirani-film-coup-53-purports-fresh-evidence-british-spy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
