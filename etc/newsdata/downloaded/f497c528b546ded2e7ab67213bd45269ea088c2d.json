That means it has to match your iPhone\u2019s system-wide settings, which is pretty standard right now as most iOS app makers are adding dark mode support for the first time.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s always better to have more visual options, and I can\u2019t complain too much about an Instagram experience that is, in my opinion, much improved. For those keen on trying it out, the update is out now on the App Store.", "description": "Instagram has updated its iPhone app to take advantage of native dark mode support in iOS 13, and it makes scrolling through your feed and tapping through Stories much easier on the eyes if you\u2019re not a fan of Instagram\u2019s popping color palette and bright white borders.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCNXBmqJO2tm1eqRlNvkSamDTPM=/0x453:4000x2547/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19268521/dark_mode_instagram.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
