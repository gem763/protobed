She has pleaded not guilty to fabricating the accusation of rape, but could be imprisoned for up to a year if found guilty.\n\nForced to relinquish her passport and remain in Nicosia, the island\u2019s capital, she has already spent a month in detention, sharing a cramped cell with nine other women.\n\nA growing number of human rights organisations are demanding her release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brutal what she and her family have had to endure,\u201d said Susana Pavlou, the director of the Nicosia-based Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies. \u201cIt is totally disproportionate to what she is accused of.\u201d\n\nThe NGO is among 11 organisations that last week urged Cyprus\u2019s attorney general, Costas Clerides, to dismiss the case, which is being watched as closely there as it is in Israel and the UK.\n\nThe student \u2013 who cannot be publicly identified \u2013 says she retracted the rape claims under duress during prolonged police interrogation. A confession, retracting her initial accusation of assault in the resort town of Ayia Napa, was signed at 2am after eight hours of questioning, according to her lawyers. They have been highly critical of the fact that a lawyer was not present.\n\nThe same day, the Briton\u2019s alleged assailants were released from custody and allowed to return home. Most were 18 although at least two were 15.\n\nMichael Pollak, a barrister with the legal aid group Justice Abroad, which is spearheading a four-strong team defending the Briton, said it was evident she had post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 brought on by her change of status from victim to suspect \u2013 and was susceptible to pressure.\n\n\u201cIt is the flight instinct of those who suffer from PTSD to want to take the easy way out and what is so unique here is that nothing was recorded by [Cypriot] police, creating the perfect environment for officers in the station to exert undue pressure on her to change evidence.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear police in Cyprus were under immense pressure to deal with the matter quickly, that no one wanted rape claims hovering over Ayia Napa, which after all depends on young tourists.\u201d\n\nLast week, police denied any mishandling of the case. \u201cWe have treated this affair with utmost sensitivity and seriousness,\u201d said the force\u2019s chief spokesman, Christos Andreou.\n\nCyprus\u2019s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The divided island\u2019s Greek-administered south is keen to expand already warm ties with Israel. The east Mediterranean nations are linked by security and energy ties that officials consider to be strategic and politically sensitive.\n\nLocal NGOs echo the argument of the woman\u2019s defence lawyers that police mishandled the inquiry.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset she had no access to basic rights as foreseen under domestic and EU law,\u201d said Pavlou, adding that in a patriarchal society such as Cyprus the case had highlighted a lack of protocol by authorities in rape complaints.\n\n\u201cFor three days she had no mental health support. We have asked the attorney general to intervene because we want to put an end to her re-victimisation and this constant media exposure, which can only be traumatic. What we have seen has amounted to cannibalism. It is hugely troubling.\u201d\n\nThe trial is set to last at least three days. If convicted, the Briton\u2019s defence team say they will take the case to the European court of human rights.", "description": "Woman, 19, says police pressure led her to retract claim of rape by 12 Israeli tourists in hotel", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20801c1b356c6e9af0a48e72d1f0e2dcbbf89719/0_0_4131_2479/master/4131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=804d13ac3385eb8c016738761e4fc76c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
