Photo: Butch Dill/AP/Shutterstock\n\nRepublicans in Virginia and beyond have had great sport with the \u201cblackface scandals\u201d that struck two Democratic statewide officials, Governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring, earlier this year. In both cases, old campus yearbook photos that appeared to exhibit the future pols in blackface created intense embarrassment and (for a while, at least) a real chance of career catastrophe. Both Northam and Herring apologized and survived demands for resignation. But it\u2019s been a real mess that has made Virginia Democrats\u2019 efforts to regain control of the legislature this year much more difficult than they might have been.\n\nBy the law of averages, you had to figure it wasn\u2019t only Democrats with this particular skeleton in their closets. And now Alabama governor Kay Ivey has made the blackface scandal bipartisan, as the major state news site al.com reports:\n\nGov. Kay Ivey is contacting state legislators, and apologizing for her role in a racist student skit from her time as an Auburn student. Ivey was president of her Alpha Gamma Delta pledge class at Auburn.\n\nPhotos of her sorority sisters in blackface emerged earlier this year. None showed the governor.\n\nBut Thursday she apologized after audio emerged of a skit at a Baptist Student Union Party. The audio is a radio interview of Ivey and her then-fiance, Ben LaRavia. He describes Ivey as wearing blue coveralls and said she \u201chad put some black paint all over her face.\u201d\n\nIvey says she doesn\u2019t remember the skit or the blackface, but perhaps recognizing that there really wasn\u2019t much in the way of innocent racial insensitivity in Alabama in 1967, she\u2019s owning it and apologizing profusely:\n\nI offer my heartfelt apologies for the pain and embarrassment this causes, and I will do all I can \u2013 going forward \u2013 to help show the nation that the Alabama of today is a far cry from the Alabama of the 1960s.\n\nOh, I dunno. When Ivey was running for her first full term as governor last year (she initially ascended to the job when former governor Robert \u201cLove Gov\u201d Bentley was forced to resign in the wake of a sex-and-corruption scandal), she sure sounded like someone for whom old times there were not forgotten, as I observed at the time:\n\n[H]er first reelection ad boasts of her efforts to preserve the state\u2019s many Confederate monuments, and scores the \u201cpolitically correct nonsense\u201d from \u201cfolks in Washington\u201d suggesting that the self-styled Heart of Dixie might need to come to grips with its past in the kind of ways that \u201cspecial interest groups\u201d (e.g., every civil-rights organization in the state) recommend.\n\nIn a campaign appearance after the ad went up, Ivey doubled down on the old-timey rhetoric, attacking \u201cout-of-state liberals\u201d for messing with Alabama\u2019s fine heritage. Southerners of a certain age could not have possibly missed the echo of the old segregationist complaint about \u201coutside agitators\u201d coming in and inciting African-Americans to challenge Jim Crow.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like Ivey could have been unaware of this legacy. Indeed, a year before the blackface incident, she was campus coordinator at Auburn for the gubernatorial campaign of Lurleen Wallace, run by her husband, George, to ensure he kept his grip on Alabama despite term limits while he was off running his racist 1968 presidential campaign. Indeed, Ivy recently touted her service to the Wallaces as the inspiration for her own political career:\n\nIvey later said Wallace invited her to join her team after graduation, but she declined, a decision she said she regretted. \u201cHindsight is 20-20!,\u201d Ivey said in 2009. \u201cI should have accepted and joined her administration, but instead I chose to get married in August 1967.\u201d\n\nIvey credits Wallace nurturing her innate desire for public service. \u201cServing others has always been a passion,\u201d she said. \u201cLurleen Wallace helped me develop that passion over when she was running for governor and I was a student at Auburn.\u201d\n\nLooks like she\u2019s not about to apologize for that.", "description": "The blackface scandal that hit Virginia governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring went bipartisan as Alabama Republican governor Kay Ivey admits she wore blackface in a campus skit soon after campaigning for George Wallace\u2019s wife.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/29/29-kay-ivey.w1200.h630.jpg"}
