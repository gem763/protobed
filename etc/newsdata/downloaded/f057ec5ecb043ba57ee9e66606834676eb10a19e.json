I thought from a very young age I want to work the way I like to work.\n\n\u2018Sometimes today I weigh up a little bit \u2018have I done well or not?\u2019 But I felt that I was in a club [Arsenal] where I met my needs the way I wanted to work.\n\n\u2018Why change that and maybe be in a bit more glorious situation but less happy situation and less influenceable situation, where I had less influence on the club [Real Madrid]?\n\n\u2018So I decided that I keep trying to experience my love story [at Arsenal].\u2019\n\nWenger was again linked with the Real Madrid job last year when Julen Lopetegui lost his job, but said he was never contacted by the club about the role.\n\nThe former Monaco boss is still keen to return to club management and has not retired, but is remaining patient as he waits for a suitable opportunity.\n\nThe France national team, Paris Saint-Germain or a move to the Chinese Super League have been touted as possible options for Wenger, but no new job looks likely to materialise any time soon.\n\nMORE: Arsenal eyeing up Scunthorpe United\u2019s record-breaking midfielder Joey Dawson\n\nMORE: Arsenal star Mesut Ozil recommended Serge Gnabry for Germany call-up five years ago", "description": "Arsene Wenger has admitted that his loyalty to Arsenal cost him success in his career, saying that it is a 'fact that he could have won more by going somewhere...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1133905711_1570978865.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
