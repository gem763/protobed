although he insists if he had to make the same decision again, he wold act the same way.\n\nHalliwell slaughtered Becky and Sian and dumped their bodies in shallow graves.\n\nSian had been on a night out with friends on March 19, 2011, when she vanished as she made her way home.\n\nIt was a journey - from nightclub to the home she shared with her boyfriend - that should have taken just 15 minutes.\n\nBut after leaving Suju in Swindon, Sian was captured on CCTV one final time before she disappeared.\n\n(Image: Godden Family / SWNS)\n\nHer boyfriend, Kevin Reape, raised the alarm at 9.45am the following morning when Sian hadn't turned up at home.\n\nHe had messaged his girlfriend at 3.24am, just over half an hour after she left the club, and mobile phone records revealed Sian's phone ahd received this message in Savernake Forest.\n\nBut at 12 miles from the club the only way Sian could have made it there was by car.\n\nA huge search was launched, involving the police and members of the public, but was stood down four days later when officers said they were following \"significant lines of inquiry\".\n\nTo the public, police released CCTV images of a green Toyota Avensis, but Det Supt Fulcher believed he knew who the criminal was.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe pinpointed Halliwell as the prime suspect and put the taxi driver under constant police surveillance.\n\nBut is was Halliwell himself that forced police to make an arrest.\n\nWhen he was spotted buying large quantities of pills, police feared he was about to commit suicide, and they swooped in to charge him with Sian's kidnap and his green Toyota was seized.\n\nIn the following seconds, Det Supt Fulcher made a decision that would ultimately solve not only this case but that of murdered Becky Godden-Edwards.\n\nHowever, it also ended his own career within the police force.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nInstead of cautioning Halliwell for a third time and taking him straight to a police station, Det Supt Fulcher tried something completely different that wasn't in the rule book.\n\nIf Halliwell had been taken to the Gablecross police station in Swindon, he would have had access to a solicitor before he was formally questioned.\n\nInstead, Det Supt Fulcher told his officers to take Halliwell to Barbury castle.\n\nThe Iron Age hill fort was where the detective chose to question Halliwell.\n\nHe insists he believed Sian was still alive and if there was any chance of rescuing her and bringing her home safely, he was going to take it.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDet Supt Fulcher also believed in a police officer's \"gut instinct\" and believed if he could look Halliwell in the eyes he would know if he was guilty or not.\n\nThe killer and the cop formed a strange connection over the next four hours as det Supt Fulcher questioned Halliwell.\n\nSince, he has said it was \"the most intense four hours I've ever experienced or am ever likely to experience\".\n\nEven in the face of Halliwell's denials and stony silence, the police officer refused to back down.\n\nHe threw everything at it, even warning Halliwell he would be crucified in the press if he didn't come clean.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDet Supt Fulcher was about to give up when Halliwell finally cracked and agreed to take police to where he had dumped Sian's body.\n\nWhile she was recovered, Det Supt Fulcher sat on the tail of the chalk horse, known as the White Horse, in nearby Uffington, Oxfordshire,\n\nAs the two men continued to talk, Halliwell offered up another victim - Becky Godden-Edwards.\n\nHe asked Det Supt Fulcher \"do you want another one?\" before leading the team to the field where he had buried Becky back in 2003.\n\nThe 20-year-old's body was found in a shallow grave.\n\n(Image: Wiltshire Police/PA)\n\nShe had been missing for nine years and her murder could have remained unsolved but for Det Supt Fulcher.\n\nDespite convicting Halliwell of Sian's kidnap and murder and jailing him for 25 years, the judge threw out Becky's case.\n\nJudge Mrs Justice Cox ruled both of Halliwell's confessions were inadmissable as evidence because Det Supt Fulcher had breached Police and Criminal Evidence Act guidelines by not cautioning the killer and giving him access to a solicitor.\n\nAnd in 2013 Det Supt Fulcher was found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct for ignoring force orders following an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.\n\nBy May the following year the officer felt he had no choice but to leave Wilthshire Police.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nDespite it ending his career, Fulcher still insists it was the right decision.\n\nHe told the Guardian : \"It's a simple moral issue. I did these things because they were the right things to do in the circumstances.\n\n\"In fact, they were the only thing to do.\"\n\nJust two years after Fulcher left the police, judge Sir John Griffith Williams allowed his evidence about Becky's death to be heard in court.\n\nHalliwell was convicted and will now never be released from prison.\n\n(Image: Rowan Griffiths/Daily Mirror)\n\nBecky's family were always grateful to Fulcher for solving her murder.\n\nHer mum, Karen Godden-Edwards, previously told the Mirror: \"I know for a fact that if Halliwell had been given a lawyer he would not have told the police where my Becky was buried.\n\n\"We may never have found her if it wasn\u2019t done this way.\n\n\"I think a senior police officer should be able to make decisions about the arrest at the time.\n\n\"Steve made a split-second one. If it was not for him Halliwell could still be driving around in a taxi and God only knows how many \u00adothers there could have been.\"\n\n(Image: Matt Frost)\n\nBut life has been far from simple for the former police officer since he left the force.\n\nHe says his services are shunned in Britain because of his actions in capturing Halliwell.\n\nFulcher has worked as a consultant for a private company in Somalia which offers aid from the Foreign Office.\n\nAnd Paul Andrew Williams, who directed the series, says the scars of what happened are still visible.\n\nHe added: \"You can really sort of see the damage that has been done to him and sort of observing him you can see.\n\n\"It\u2019s really interesting to be with him to just sort of see and try and understand how one\u2019s life can be f****** destroyed by something like this.\n\n\"But the injustice of it all and not necessarily being able to make it all better because obviously, it is out of your power, is very, very tough.\"", "description": "Det Supt Steve Fulcher actions led double killer Christopher Halliwell to confess, which has inspired the ITV show", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Itv", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Godden Family", "Swns", "Pa", "Wiltshire Police Pa", "Rowan Griffiths Daily Mirror", "Matt Frost"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20099114.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Murder-probe-in-Wiltshire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
