And for the president, it had the potential to overshadow one of Mr Obama\u2019s legacies and earn Mr Trump the kind of plaudits he believes are unfairly reserved for other presidents.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And, there, he continued to underscore his competition with Mr Obama by speaking at length about what he said were his own premonitions about bin Laden, rather than focusing on the events of the day.\n\nHe also repeated the misleading claim that he delivered a warning about bin Laden in one of his books. \u201cNobody listened to me,\u201d Mr Trump lamented. \u201cTo this day, I get people coming up to me, and they said, \u2018You know, one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn reality, the US president\u2019s book The America We Deserve makes one passing reference to bin Laden, where he is simply referred to as \u201cpublic enemy No 1\u201d.\n\nBut Sunday morning, Mr Trump took credit not only for the raid that killed Baghdadi, but also for having been wiser than his predecessors. \u201cI made a prediction,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. If they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different.\u201d\n\nFrom his implicit undermining of Mr Obama to his focus on the fact that he has never received the credit he deserves, Mr Trump handled the moment in a familiar way: putting himself at the centre of the action, releasing information such as the number of helicopters involved in the operation that are normally classified, and focusing on vivid, cinematic details of a raid he bragged unfolded \u201cas though you were watching a movie\u201d.\n\nAll presidents make military victories their own, but for Mr Trump, that movie was a lot about him.\n\nRecalling the scene on Saturday in the Situation Room, he claimed to have watched the raid from an \u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d view of the skirmish and appeared to relish the details.\n\n\u201cThey blasted their way in so quickly, it was incredible,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cWhen he blew himself up, the tunnel collapsed on top of him, on top of everything \u2014 and his children. I mean, so he led his three children to death,\u201d he said of Baghdadi. Mr Trump added that the body of the Isis leader \u201cwas mutilated by the blast\u201d.\n\nA photograph released by the White House showed Mr Trump in the Situation Room on Saturday, surrounded by his top aides, monitoring developments.\n\nThe photo, showing six stone-faced men staring into the camera, appeared to be the US president\u2019s answer to the photograph of Mr Obama and his team receiving live updates about the operation to kill bin Laden.\n\nBut Mr Trump\u2019s breathless language stood in contrast to the stark version of events Mr Obama relayed to the public after the secret raid that killed bin Laden.\n\n\u201cA small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability,\u201d Mr Obama said, addressing the nation in 2011. \u201cNo Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\u201d\n\nAfter reading his statement, Mr Obama turned around and left the podium, taking no questions.\n\nMr Trump ended his news conference after defending his decision to pull US troops out of Syria and criticising president George W Bush\u2019s decision to send troops to Iraq.\n\n\u201cHe was a gutless animal,\u201d Mr Trump said in closing of Baghdadi. \u201cThank you all very much. I appreciate it. Very great day for our country.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "From the moment Donald Trump learned Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Isis, had been killed in a commando raid in Syria, he handled the news in an unusual way. \u201cSomething very big just happened!\u201d Mr Trump teased on Twitter on Saturday night around 9.30pm, just hours after US\u00a0forces had landed in the region.", "authors": ["Annie Karni", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
