They have been linked to the murder of 23-year-old Sinethemba Gwatya on July 29. He was murdered by a group of suspects after they severely assaulted him and then set his body alight using tyres.\n\nThe five suspects, which include four men aged between 32 and 47 years old and a 37-year-old woman, were detained at New Brighton police station.\n\nA group of community members gathered at the gates of the police station on Thursday morning demanding their release, but after Public Order Police intervention, the group dispersed again by noon. The suspects will be appearing before the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Thursday to face charges of murder.\n\nThe Motherwell cluster commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, applauded the arrests and repeated the warning that \"The SAPS cannot allow communities to take the law into their own hands by becoming a community of killers and killing persons in the streets. Any person taking part in such activities will be arrested and charged with murder.\"\n\nAny person that can assist police in these murder cases can contact Detective Lieutenant Colonel Marlize Dippenaar at 082 457 2507.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
