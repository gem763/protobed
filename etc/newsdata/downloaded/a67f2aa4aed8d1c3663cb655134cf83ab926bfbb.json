Montgomery Advertiser\n\nMONTGOMERY \u2014 If former Sen. Jeff Sessions gets into the Alabama Senate race, the Republicans already in the race say they\u2019ll stick to their plans.\n\nBut many of those plans include pledges of loyalty to President Donald Trump. And some seemed likely to weaponize Sessions' time as U.S. attorney general under Trump, a brief affair that ended bitterly.\n\n\u201cIf the voters of Alabama want a career politician as their next U.S. senator, then they have plenty of choices,\u201d a statement from former Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville\u2019s campaign said Tuesday. \u201cIf they want a political outsider who will actually stand with President Trump and fight the DC establishment when it matters the most, then I am the only choice. Jeff Sessions had a chance to stand and defend the President and he failed.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaks during the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce annual meeting in Montgomery, Ala., on Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2018. (Photo: Jake Crandall/ Advertiser)\n\nThere was a spectrum of opinion Tuesday on the likelihood of Sessions \u2014 a U.S. senator from Alabama from 1997 to 2017 \u2014 entering the race. Staffers on three separate campaigns suggested Sessions\u2019 entry would hurt campaigns other than their own. But few thought the messages of the campaigns would change.\n\nThe Associated Press and Politico reported Monday evening that Sessions was looking into the possibility of entering the race, citing three Republicans with knowledge of the situation. Qualifying for the March 3 primary ends on Nov. 8.\n\nAfter winning election in 1996, Sessions cruised to three re-elections while firmly positioning himself on the right edge of the Republican Party. He became notable as a hardliner on immigration policies.\n\nFormer Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville speaking at Montgomery Quarterback Club on Sept. 12, 2017 (Photo: Michael Galvin)\n\nSessions was an early endorser of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016 and was later named his attorney general, where he aggressively used the courts for immigration enforcement and restricted asylum access.\n\nSessions recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia due to meetings he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, which he did not disclose during his confirmation hearing in 2017. The recusal led to hot-tempered criticism from the president, who belittled his decision and later called his hiring of Sessions his \u201cbiggest mistake.\u201d\n\nDespite the criticism, Sessions has continued to praise the president in the few public appearances he has made since stepping down late last year.\n\n\u201cThis very public adventure, I have to say, exceeded my expectations,\u201d Sessions said at an appearance in Montgomery in December 2018. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Trump\u2019s policy agenda and proud to have a part in it.\u201d\n\nSimilar loyalty to Trump is a hallmark of the Republicans in the race. U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Mobile, has been a vocal critic of the impeachment investigation, probing Trump's conditioning military aid to Ukraine on officials there providing information embarrassing to former Vice President Joe Biden, a presidential candidate. Byrne also voted against a resolution criticism Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw combat troops from northern Syria.\n\nLenze Morris, a spokeswoman for Byrne, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cBradley isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is laser-focused on becoming the next senator from Alabama and will lead efforts to secure our borders, fight for American workers and stand up to Democrats and their deep state allies attempting to nullify and sabotage the Trump presidency.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep Bradley Byrne looks at the slavery statues during a congressional delegation visit at the EJI National Memorial in Montgomery, Ala., on Friday, March 1, 2019. (Photo: Jake Crandall/ Advertiser)\n\nIt\u2019s not at all certain how Trump\u2019s criticisms of Sessions would play out in the primary, in part because Trump\u2019s endorsement record in Alabama GOP primaries is mixed. He gave his blessing to U.S. Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, in 2018 in a crowded primary where Roby\u2019s opponents tried to make an issue of her criticism of Trump bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals on an Access Hollywood tape released in 2016. Roby ultimately prevailed in a runoff.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s endorsement of then-Sen. Luther Strange in a special election in 2017 failed to boost the incumbent, who lost a special election to former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. Despite accusations of Moore assaulting, harassing, or making unwelcome comments to nine separate women, Trump later endorsed Moore, who lost the general election to Democratic nominee Doug Jones.\n\nMoore, who is running again for the seat, said in a statement Tuesday Sessions entering the race would have no bearing on his campaign.\n\n\u201cI like Jeff Sessions, I know him,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to him. It wouldn\u2019t affect one way or another what I do.\u201d\n\nMore: Doug Jones leads third-quarter fundraising in U.S. Senate race\n\nThe prospect of an impeachment vote in the Senate is potentially complicating an already tough election fight for Doug Jones, a red-state Democrat. (Photo: Kim Chandler, AP)\n\nJones is considered one of the Senate\u2019s more vulnerable incumbents, thanks to Trump\u2019s all-but-certain presence on the presidential ballot next year and straight-ticket Republican voting. But the incumbent has held his own in the money chase: He pulled in $2 million in the third quarter, more than the entire GOP field combined, and has $5 million on hand. Byrne has $2.5 million on hand and Tuberville has $1.4 million in the bank.\n\nThe Friends of Sessions Senate Committee reported $2.4 million on hand in its latest FEC filing, filed earlier this month.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/jeff-sessions-senate-alabama-some-campaigns-stress-loyalty-donald-trump/2501756001/", "description": "Tommy Tuberville said in a statement that \"Jeff Sessions had a chance to stand and defend the president and he failed.\"", "authors": ["Brian Lyman", "Published P.M.
