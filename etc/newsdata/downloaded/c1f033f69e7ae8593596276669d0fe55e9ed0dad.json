But the chef alleges that the inspector simply had an \u201cunsophisticated palate\u201d and mistook the cheese's yellow color (it was made with saffron) for cheddar while visiting Veyrat's La Maison des Bois eatery in the French Alps.\n\nApparently, the incident caused the establishment to lose a star in the Michelin Guide\u2019s rating.\n\nGUY FIERI RESPONDS TO SUGGESTION THAT HE PLAY URSULA IN LIVE-ACTION 'LITTLE MERMAID' REMAKE\n\nWhile speaking with France Inter radio, Veyrat said, \u201cI\u2019ve been dishonored. I saw my team in tears, to have them call you one evening without warning, without anything written down, without anything, to say \u2018That\u2019s it, it\u2019s over,'\u201d according to a transcript in the New York Post.\n\nVeyrat explained, \u201cI put saffron in it, and the gentleman who came thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. That\u2019s what you call knowledge of a place? It\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe described losing the star as, \u201cworse than a wound,\" as well as \"profoundly offensive.\"\n\n\"It gave me depression,\u201d he said.\n\nVeyrat\u2019s lawyer, Emmanuel Ravanas, said his client is more upset about the Michelin inspector's false accusation than anything else.\n\n\u201cFor decades, Marc Veyrat has been used to having his cooking graded, evaluated and compared, and he knows quite well that you don\u2019t own a star for life,\u201d Ravanas told Agence France-Presse. \u201cHe accepts it all, as long as the criticism is accurate.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nIn a statement obtained by the New York Post, Michelin said they understand \u201cthe disappointment for Mr. Veyrat, whose talent no one contests, even if we regret his unreasonable persistence with his accusations.
