Maybe I am missing that 15 per cent I need for the grand finale of this career.'\n\nBuffon moved to PSG for what he thought was one last tilt at Champions League success\n\nBuffon has also hailed Cristiano Ronaldo's positive impact on the Juventus dressing room\n\nBuffon, who has made two appearances for Juve this season since his return, also revealed his pleasure at sharing a dressing room with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n'After that overhead kick he scored against us for Real Madrid, I asked him how old he was. He smiled and said: 'I'm 33. Not bad, right?'\n\n'I thought: 'Look at this son of a\u2026' If you can't beat'em, you join'em! I must say, Cristiano is really a nice guy to be around, we spend a long time discussing and preparing things, he interacts with his teammates. He has been a pleasant surprise.\n\n'If he were to win the Ballon d'Or, and I hope he does, it'll mean Juve will too have won something important. I know that I never got one, but it's very tough for goalkeepers, the only shot-stopper who ever got the Ballon d'Or was the legendary Lev Yashin.'", "description": "Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon\u00a0has revealed he's desperate to end his playing career by winning the Champions League and hailed the positive impact of Cristiano Ronaldo at the club.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658766-0-image-a-145_1570980388545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
