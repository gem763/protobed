In the company of diehard supporters, prospective Trump voters and Minnesotans who simply came for the show, the president unloaded on Joe Biden over his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China, claiming at one point that the only reason the former vice president landed a spot on the 2008 ticket was because \u201che understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nFar from the only coarse language in his hour-plus speech, Trump jokingly referred to himself as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d while imitating an intimate conversation between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page. And he suggested that his campaign print t-shirts emblazoned with the phrase \u201cWhere the hell is he?\u201d in reference to Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who has kept a low profile since the Ukraine scandal first broke.\n\n\u201cThe radical Democrats\u2019 policies are crazy. Their politics are corrupt. Their candidates are terrible and they know they can\u2019t win on Election Day, so they\u2019re pursuing an illegal \u2026 unconstitutional bullshit impeachment,\u201d he said Friday, repeating a line from his rally the previous evening.\n\nThe more Trump focused on Biden, the more he repeated disproved claims about his potential 2020 opponent \u2014 mocking him for asking cable news executives and major newspapers not to write about the president\u2019s \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and accusing the Democratic presidential hopeful of enriching his family while \u201cAmerica got robbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleepy Joe and his friends sold out America,\u201d Trump said Thursday night in Minneapolis as he assured the crowd it\u2019s \u201cmuch better\u201d when he ditches his prepared remarks.\n\nOn Friday, he claimed the media would demand that his own children be jailed if they conducted business like Biden\u2019s son, whom he has repeatedly accused of accepting $1.5 billion from Chinese officials in exchange for pressuring his father to advocate for trade deals with the country.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump, or if our beautiful Ivanka \u2026 if they walked out with $1.5 billion?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey would be saying, \u2018Where\u2019s the nearest cell?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe president also went after Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who along with Biden have consistently polled at the top of the 2020 Democratic primary field. Trump mocked Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack, for sharing a video earlier Friday of him hitting baseballs outside his home in Vermont.\n\n\u201cBernie was hitting a baseball today to show how strong he was,\u201d Trump said, warning his supporters that if the self-avowed Democratic socialist exits the race, \u201cit looks like those [votes] will go to your radical leftist, Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that will probably, most likely be the end of sleepy Joe,\u201d he added.\n\nOff-script, Trump appeared increasingly aggrieved and ready to exact revenge against Democrats who, in recent weeks, have accused him of abusing his power as president and obstructing congressional investigations into his most controversial actions \u2014 including asking the Ukrainian leader to dig up dirt on Biden and his son. In both Louisiana and Minnesota, the president relied on the same fiery language and evidence-free claims he often used against Mueller and his team of \u201cangry Democrats\u201d to attack House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the growing number of members from her caucus who have publicly endorsed impeachment in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Nancy Pelosi hates the United States of America,\u201d Trump told the crowd on Friday, drawing a response of sustained booing.\n\n\u201cAll of our nation\u2019s gains are put at risk by a rage-filled Democrat party that has gone completely insane,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Democrats are fighting to restore the wretched political class that \u2026 surrendered our sovereignty, flooded our cities with drugs and crimes and bogged us down in one foreign war after another.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s rally capped a day filled with more twists in the impeachment drama, as well as several adverse legal rulings for the president and a key departure from his administration.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, defied a directive from the administration not to testify about being recalled from her post, and appeared in a marathon session before the three House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOne of the two foreign-born associates of the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week while trying to leave the country was reported to have boasted three years ago about his friendship with Trump, even as the president on Friday said he didn\u2019t know either of them.\n\nAnd in the courts, Trump lost an appeal to keep his financial records from Democrats investigating him, then suffered setbacks on trying to deny green cards to certain immigrants and reappropriate federal money for the construction of his border wall.\n\nMinutes after arriving in Louisiana, the president also announced via Twitter that acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan would be leaving his position in the coming days after just six months on the job. The outgoing DHS secretary \u201cwants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe president said he would announce a successor to McAleenan in the comings days, noting that this person would also be brought on board in an acting capacity.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/28/b4/6110a78b47209cde48d890a27cc3/191011-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
