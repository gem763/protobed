I struggle to read the offerings: h cks, he e nd om t toa ti\n\nThen I realise it\u2019s a peg board where items are composed of individual plastic letters and several have fallen off. The caf\u00e9\u2019s interior decor \u2013 red Formica tables and wood veneer walls, suggests it was last updated circa 1960. Strung across the ceiling are faded Christmas paper-chains (it\u2019s September) that predate Slade, possibly even Bing.\n\nCaffi Cwtch seemed to materialise out of nowhere, a concrete cube on a misty B-road in mid-Powys. Yet it\u2019s three quarters full, mostly with regulars, judging by the lively banter. There must be a settlement nearby, though I can\u2019t check Google Maps as there\u2019s been no signal for miles.\n\nHorlicks, and cheese and tomato toastie \u2013 as I\u2019ve now deciphered \u2013sound just the thing to brighten this grey day. Waitress Delyth (full complement of letters embroidered across her chest) is apologetic. She has to shout to make herself heard over the drumming of hailstones on the corrugated iron roof: \u201cSorry, my lovely. We\u2019ve run out of Horlicks. Blame Welsh Water.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Welsh water in its various meteorological states has spoilt my morning\u2019s plans. Dawn began with a downpour; soggy-bottomed clouds now squat over the hills, obliterating my hopes of seeing the wheeling red kites, recently reintroduced into these parts. But I\u2019m puzzled as to how H2O could be held responsible for the disappearance of the milky comfort beverage.\n\nIt turns out Delyth is talking about a passing trio of engineers from the utility company who commandeered the last few scoops earlier this morning. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Gwyn\u2019ll do,\u201d she confides as she turns to the hissing chrome coffee machine. \u201cHe always has Horlicks.\u201d\n\nThe door blows open to admit a bedraggled Gwyn and his dripping collie. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of those,\u201d he decides, pointing at my glass cup.\n\n\u201cOoh, lah-tay! There\u2019s posh. I\u2019ll have a cup of tea on standby, is it?\u201d Delyth offers.\n\nA sign on the wall reads \u201cCraft club here, Tuesdays 10am-12noon. Knit and natter.\u201d Today is Friday, and it\u2019s gone 1pm, but a rapid clicking from the table behind alerts me to two women, elbows pistoning, as their embryonic scarves dangle precariously over plates of po ched ggs nd c ips.\n\nClearly, time here is as elastic as the sagging streamers and I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2019ll discover evidence of Thursday\u2019s \u201cUkulele and Cawl\u201d evening. Sadly, no George Formby impersonators; however, the unmistakable aroma of cooked leeks overlaid with lamb hints that there could be a few remaining portions of the iconic soup lurking nearby.\n\nAs I pay my bill, ready to head back out into the wet Welsh afternoon, I hear one of the knitters ask: \u201cHow was the latte, Gwyn?\u201d\n\n\u201cTidy. Bit like Horlicks, really. But without the taste.\u201d\n\nHow to enter the Just Back travel writing competition\n\nEmail your entry, in 500 words (with the text in the body of the email), to justback@telegraph.co.uk.\n\nThe winner will receive \u00a3250 in the currency of their choice from the Post Office.
