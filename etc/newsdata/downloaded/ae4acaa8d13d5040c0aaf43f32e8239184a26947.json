Jarvis Landry had eight catches for 167 yards before leaving with a suspected concussion, and Odell Beckham Jr. had two catches for 20 yards in a supporting role.\n\nThe addition of Beckham and the maturation of Mayfield, combined with an improved defense, created high expectations for the Browns (2-2) during the offseason. Then Cleveland started 1-2, losing twice at home. Worse, Mayfield threw five interceptions and just three touchdown passes.\n\nNone of that mattered after the Browns breezed past the Ravens.\n\n\u201cWe know how good we can be. That\u2019s the frustrating part about how we started,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWe just need to do our job and that\u2019s what guys did this week.\u201d\n\nFirst-year coach Freddie Kitchens concurred.\n\n\u201cYou keep your head down and keep working, usually good things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou turn the corner.\u201d\n\nCleveland kept Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson in check and used a mixture of Mayfield\u2019s passing and Chubb\u2019s physical running to rip the Ravens for 530 yards - the second straight week Baltimore (2-2) yielded more than 500 yards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to clean it up and guys do their job. Simple as that,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing our assignment the way we\u2019re supposed to, too many times, and it\u2019s costing us big plays.\u201d\n\nMayfield hit Landry for 65 yards and connected with Ricky Seals-Jones for 59. Then, of course, there was that 88-yard run. In all, the Browns had 10 plays of at least 16 yards.\n\nAs a result, Cleveland finds itself tied atop the division with the Ravens, who won it last year. It\u2019s the first time Cleveland has been in first place after four games since 2013.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really won anything,\u201d Kitchens conceded. \u201cGuys, it\u2019s just one game.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that Cleveland went 1-15 in 2016 and 0-16 just two years ago, and this victory came against a team that owned a 30-10 lead in a series that began in 1999 - three years after Art Modell moved the original Browns to Baltimore.\n\nJackson\u2019s deft passing and elusive running were a key part of Baltimore\u2019s 2-0 start, but for a second straight week he couldn\u2019t make up for his own team\u2019s porous defense. He got the Ravens to 24-18 with 9:51 left before Chubb took a pitch deep in his own territory, burst through a hole on the right side and ran untouched into the end zone.\n\n\u201cAnybody could have ran through that hole,\u201d Chubb said.\n\nA subsequent fourth-down gamble by Baltimore failed before Jackson threw successive interceptions . The first one ended a run of 248 passes without being picked off.\n\nJackson went 24 of 34 for 247 yards and three scores. He had 66 yards rushing.\n\nDown 17-10, the Ravens were moving for the potential tying score when Mark Ingram had the ball pried loose by Jermaine Whitehead, and Chad Thomas recovered at the Cleveland 26. It was Baltimore\u2019s first turnover of the season.\n\nThe Browns immediately went the other way and grabbed a two-touchdown advantage late in the third quarter with a 2-yard run by Chubb.\n\nCHOKE HOLD\n\nBeckham and Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey tangled several times during the game and got into a heated scuffle in the third quarter. Beckham threw a punch and Humphrey choked him after they wrestled to the ground. Both players were penalized.\n\n\u201cI ran to him after the game, apologized,\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really the brand of football I really want to represent. When the whistle blows, it\u2019s got to be over with.\u201d\n\nHAIL BRIAN\n\nThe Ravens inducted former coach Brian Billick into the team\u2019s Ring of Honor , adding his name to the facade on the upper deck. Billick led Baltimore to a Super Bowl victory during the 2000 season and went 85-67 from 1999-2007.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBrowns: Starting CBs Denzel Ward and Greedy Williams were inactive with hamstring injuries for a second straight week. \u2026 LB Willie Harvey left in the first quarter with a shoulder injury and did not return.\n\nRavens: DT Brandon Williams (knee) was placed on the inactive list after struggling during a pregame workout.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrowns: For the second time in three weeks, Cleveland plays in prime time, facing the San Francisco 49ers on the road Monday night.\n\nRavens: In the second of three successive AFC North games, Baltimore travels to Pittsburgh to face the rival Steelers (0-3 entering Monday night game vs. Cincinnati).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mayfield threw for 342 yards and a touchdown, Nick Chubb ran for a pivotal 88-yard score and the Browns beat the Baltimore Ravens 40-25 Sunday to earn a share of first place in the AFC North.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/browns_ravens_football_45609_c0-0-3956-2306_s1770x1032.jpg?05970838c9490256427da3fc07bb3a7de2f3719e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
