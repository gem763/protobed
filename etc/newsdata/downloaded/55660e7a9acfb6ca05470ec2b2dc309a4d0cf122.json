When the photographers and the videomakers arrive at her home, she slips into her bedroom and puts on some makeup to welcome the guests. She is ready for the day she will never forget.\n\nMaria on the morning of the party day. When the photographers and videomakers arrive at her home, she runs into her bedroom to put on some makeup\n\nMaria at home during a photo shoot. Right: Giusy at home being helped by her mother into the dress she has just bought\n\nFirst communion in Naples is not just a religious sacrament but is experienced as an important rite of passage to be properly celebrated, and a community event with many levels of interpretation and meaning, not just limited to religion.\n\nEleonora and Giusy play and dance at the Princess Royal Palace in Telese during the party for their first communion\n\nFor the young person involved and for their family the holy communion is filled with social and moral public obligations to be fulfilled, from wearing expensive clothes to providing banquets and putting on spectacular stage shows with bands singing modern Neapolitan pop music.\n\nDoves are often released during the communion ceremonies to add to the spectacle\n\nMaria posing for a photo shoot at the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa\n\nMaria during a photo shoot before her party. Right: leaving her house with her parents on the day of the celebration\n\nIn recent years, communions have often become more important than weddings, especially for parents who have had children before marriage. The celebration of their child\u2019s communion becomes the feast of their dreams, the one they did not have for their wedding, and it is also perceived as an entrance into society.\n\nEven though in 1910 the Pope reduced the age for receiving the sacrament from 10-14 years old to seven, the first communion in the social context appears to be still related to the arrival of puberty, especially for the female communicants, often called spose bambine (child brides). They are in fact dressed, embellished and treated like young brides, with elaborate and expensive dresses made in the city\u2019s best ateliers.\n\nIn the designer\u2019s atelier, Francesca tries on her dress for last-minute adjustments as her mother and grandmother look on\n\nFrancesca in the studio for pre-communion photographs\n\nIt is even more beautiful than I expected - it\u2019s important because for a special day we need a special dress Francesca\n\nFrancesca during her dress rehearsal\n\nIn this photographic project Diana Bagnoli follows the daughters of the famous photographer of events and ceremonies, Oreste Pipolo, called \u201cthe shaman of weddings\u201d. His daughters, Ivana and Miriam, inherited their father\u2019s studio and, like him, they sell a dream, building elaborate photo sets before, during and after the first communion day.\n\nMaria\u2019s sister in the living room with relatives and neighbours who came to congratulate her\n\nMaria on her phone during the first communion lunch that will last almost the whole day\n\nAll the big expenditures \u2013 banquets, dresses, entertainments, photo shoots and so on \u2013 serve to convey a sense of social worth and to mark, or sometimes re-establish, the status of the communicant\u2019s family within the local community. There is also a competitive element in displaying and sharing your goods with the community members and putting on the best and most lavish show.\n\nSuch behaviour appears to be particularly related to a social milieu that is historically connected to poverty; to show economic capacity may mean power but also social improvement. And it is also related to the high level of \u201ctheatricality\u201d of Neapolitans in the public space, as observed by anthropologists who have done fieldwork in Naples \u2013 including myself, having carried out ethnographic work in this city for more than a decade.\n\nA band performs for Giusy in the street.

It is a premise and a promise for future success. And it has to be a day to remember forever.\n\nIrene poses during dress rehearsals for her first holy communion in the historic Naples shop Fratelli Martone, a specialist for a century in ceremonial clothing for children\n\nEleonora posing at Lido Elena di Posillipo during a photo shoot with the Pipolo photographers", "description": "Not just a religious sacrament, a child\u2019s first communion is experienced as an important rite of passage to be properly celebrated, and a community event with many levels of interpretation and meaning.
