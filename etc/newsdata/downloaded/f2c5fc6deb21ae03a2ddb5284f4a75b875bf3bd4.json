It\u2019s bound to fail, this attempt, it\u2019s already obvious,\u201d he said.\n\nThe interview was aired on Sunday ahead of Putin\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia on Oct. 14.", "description": "Moscow is not blaming U.S. President Donald Trump for failing to improve U.S.-Russian relations, a pledge he had made during his election campaign, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Arab broadcasters.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440357375&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0DP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
