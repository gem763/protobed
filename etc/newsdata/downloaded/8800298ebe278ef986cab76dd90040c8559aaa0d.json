It is high-quality architecture in its purest, most environmentally and socially conscious form.\"\n\n\"This is proper social housing, over ten years in the making, delivered by an ambitious and thoughtful council. These desirable, spacious, low-energy properties should be the norm for all council housing,\" the judges added.\n\nThe development is designed to the stringent Passivhaus standard, which means homes will use very little additional energy for heating or cooling.\n\nArchitects took inspiration from nearby Victorian streets.

These included an opera house in Leicestershire, the Macallan Distillery in Scotland and the revamped London Bridge train station.", "description": "A social housing project in Norwich, England, hailed as a \"modest masterpiece,\" has won the prestigious Stirling Prize architecture award.", "authors": ["Rory Sullivan"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191009050459-03-goldsmith-street-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
