Now I\u2019ll add a couple more \u201cno no\u201d topics: Hong Kong, the trade war and President Xi Jinping. In fact, just keep it simple and stick to the \u201c4 P\u2019s\u201d: price, product, promotion and place.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey was thinking. He manages an NBA team, and his sole purpose is to win championships, not ponder geopolitics or promote Hong Kong\u2019s independence.\n\nHis comments would be akin to making his opinions about President Donald Trump public. Whether he\u2019s pro- or anti-Trump, he\u2019s bound to alienate half of the Rockets\u2019 fan base. He would never do that, so why make a comment about another divisive topic?\n\nWhat should the NBA and the Rockets do? Morey should resign to preserve the NBA\u2019s billions of dollars of revenue, investments and goodwill. I know. It\u2019s unfair and it\u2019s un-American. In America, we all have the right to express our opinions without retribution.\n\nBut we aren\u2019t in America when we\u2019re part of the global economy. This is China. Things work differently in the Middle Kingdom, and any China-experienced business person knows that. Disney doesn\u2019t share its brand name in other countries but does a joint venture in Shanghai. Google willingly submits to Chinese censorship, and other behemoths like General Electric, Apple and McDonald\u2019s all accede to the Communist Party\u2019s wishes.\n\nOUR VIEW:China's business bullying jumps to new heights over tweet by NBA Rockets GM\n\nIf the NBA knows anything about doing business in China \u2014 and it does \u2014 Morey should slowly fade away. Then, this anti-NBA sentiment will likewise disappear.\n\nI know this leaves a bad taste for Westerners, as we are so rooted in our inalienable rights to speak freely. And this is partly why Trump is fighting a trade war with China. He wants to make a fairer playing field where Western companies can do, say and act as they wish in China. But dare I give my opinions about Trump?\n\nStanley Chao is the author of \u201cSelling to China\u201d and managing director for All In Consulting, assisting Western companies in China.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.", "description": "Doing business in China is different.
