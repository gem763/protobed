It was a strong performance on all fronts: rookie pitcher Jos\u00e9 Urquidy delivered five scoreless innings of two-hit, four-strikeout ball, while Alex Bregman snapped out of a postseason slump after going 3-for-5 with an RBI single and a grand slam.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Astros had control of the game. In the first inning, Jos\u00e9 Altuve, Michael Brantley, Alex Bregman, and Yuli Gurriel collected four consecutive singles and two runs off of Nationals\u2019 starter Patrick Corbin. Corbin recovered for a scoreless second and third, but was foiled again by Robinson Chirinos in the fourth, who belted a two-run homer \u2014 his second in two straight games \u2014 to score Carlos Correa and give the Astros a comfortable four-run lead.\n\nUrquidy, meanwhile, stymied the Nationals at every turn. He allowed a two-out single to Anthony Rendon in the first inning, then quickly retired Juan Soto with a first-pitch line out to end the inning. When Yan Gomes returned in the third with a leadoff double, he put a stop to that, too, erasing the Nationals\u2019 lone RISP with three outs from Corbin, Trea Turner, and Adam Eaton.\n\nThings went a little haywire for the Astros in the sixth, however. With Urquidy formally relieved of his duties, Josh James tried to keep the lid on the Nationals\u2019 offense \u2014 and instead issued two walks and a strikeout to put runners on first and second. He was replaced by Will Harris, who promptly gave up back-to-back hits to Rendon and Soto, allowing the Nationals to get on the board with their first and only run of the game.\n\nAny concern for Houston\u2019s lead was short-lived. In the seventh, with Tanner Rainey in for Corbin, the Astros loaded the bases with Kyle Tucker, George Springer, and Michael Brantley. Fernando Rodney subbed in for Rainey, Bregman stepped up to the plate, and two pitches later, hit a grand slam to give the Astros a cushy 8-1 advantage:\n\nNot only was the grand slam the first by a third baseman in 55 years, but Bregman\u2019s five RBI were the most by an American League player in the World Series since Hideki Matsui in 2009.\n\nFollowing Bregman\u2019s slam, neither the Astros nor the Nationals improved their side of the scoreboard. The Nationals got a pair of runners on first and second in both the seventh and eighth innings, but couldn\u2019t find a way to score in either situation \u2014 which then triggered this unsightly stat:\n\nThe #Nationals are a combined 1-for-19 with runners in scoring position during the last two World Series games at Nationals Park. #MLB #WorldSeries \u2014 William Ladson (@ladsonbill24) October 27, 2019\n\nWith the Astros\u2019 victory, the teams will enter Sunday\u2019s contest tied at two wins apiece. Game 5 will feature a match-up of their respective aces, as the Astros\u2019 Gerrit Cole and Nationals\u2019 Max Scherzer are scheduled to face off for the second time this series. Their last meeting ended unfavorably for the Astros, who saw Cole pitch to the worst results of his postseason career with five runs, a walk, and six strikeouts scattered over seven innings.\n\nGame 5 is set for 8:07 PM EDT.", "description": "Alex Bregman went 3-for-5 with an RBI single and grand slam on Saturday, helping cement the Astros' comeback as they tied the series 2-2 with the Nationals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1183673637-e1572148687906.jpg?w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
