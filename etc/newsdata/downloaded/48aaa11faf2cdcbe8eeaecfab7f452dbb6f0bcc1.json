Turkey is violating the ceasefire agreement by continuing to attack the town since last night,\" Bali said.\n\nThe details: Shelling and machine-gun fire could be heard and smoke was seen rising early Friday in the city of Ras al-Ain at the Syrian border with Turkey, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Associated Press reports the fighting died down by mid-morning.\n\nThe agreement: Vice President Pence on Thursday announced the five-day cease-fire deal, weeks after President Trump said he would be pulling U.S. troops from the area, where they've been assisting Kurdish forces, ahead of a Turkish attack. Trump's withdrawal has faced fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\nIn return for the ceasefire, the U.S. would lift sanctions imposed this week on Turkish officials.\n\nBut...: Fighting along other towns and cities on the border appeared calm, with no fighting heard from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad, according to AP.\n\nTrump touted the cease-fire deal on Thursday, earning a rebuke from Sen.

I also reminded him of Turkey's responsibility for maintaining security of the ISIS detainees located in the affected areas.\"\n\nTrump insists Turkey wants ceasefire: Trump on Friday spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as a temporary cease-fire in northern Syria teetered amid report of Turkish mortar fire.\n\nTrump tweeted that Erdo\u011fan attributed the break in the cease-fire to \"minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated.\"\n\n\"He very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen,\" he added.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump was referring to by \"the ultimate solution,\" but critics of the deal the U.S. brokered with Turkey have noted that Kurdish fighters are being forced to vacate land in northern Syria over the next few days or face additional bloodshed, and that the Trump administration did not appear to extract any significant concessions from Turkey.\n\nIn the House: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelHouse Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump insists Turkey wants cease-fire | Fighting continues in Syrian town | Pentagon chief headed to Mideast | Mattis responds to criticism from Trump Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense MORE (D-N.Y.) and committee ranking member Rep.

John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.) acknowledged that senators will have to deal with impeachment and said that he was looking to the Congressional Research Service (CRS) for guidance on the Senate's rules.\n\n\"I have a copy ordered from CRS.

The focus of the potential articles of impeachment, or how many there would be, remains unclear.\n\nBut the creeping inevitability that the Senate will have to act follows weeks of speculation that McConnell could find a loophole to let the Senate avoid an impeachment trial that would otherwise eat up precious floor time and put some of his 2020 incumbents under a fierce spotlight.\n\nThe GOP leader, however, shot down that possibility this week. Though McConnell positioned himself as a roadblock to Trump being removed from office in Facebook ads, he said this week that the Senate would fulfill its \"constitutional responsibility.\"\n\n\"Under the impeachment rules of the Senate, we'll take the matter up ... We intend to do our constitutional responsibility.\"\n\nUnsure on timeline: But the particulars of the trial, including the length, remain up in the air.\n\n\"We just talked about the Senate rules. We're going to have to have more meetings to talk about how we proceed,\" Kennedy said about the GOP briefing.\n\nGraham, asked what his message to the caucus was, said he warned his colleagues that it would be a \"roller coaster.\"\n\nMcConnell told senators during the closed-door lunch that a potential timeline for impeachment would be that the House passes articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, setting up the Senate to wrap up its trial by the end of the year.\n\nBut Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiCummings to lie in state at the Capitol House Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014Dem wants more changes to Pelosi drug pricing bill | Ebola outbreak wanes, but funding lags | Johnson & Johnson recalls batch of baby powder after asbestos traces found MORE (D-Calif.) declined to weigh in on the timeline during a weekly press conference on Thursday.\n\n\"I have no idea.

It also coincided with a host of current and former administration officials raising concerns during closed-door testimony about the administration's Ukraine policy.\n\nMulvaney indicated he felt the behavior was nothing out of the ordinary, telling reporters to \"get over it.\"\n\n\"There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,\" Mulvaney said during a rare press conference in the White House briefing room. \"That's going to happen.\"\n\nHis comments threaten to erode the administration's narrative that there was no quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine and may bolster the Democrats' impeachment probe.\n\nMATTIS RESPONDS TO TRUMP CRITICISM: Former Defense secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump insists Turkey wants cease-fire | Fighting continues in Syrian town | Pentagon chief headed to Mideast | Mattis responds to criticism from Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: White House does damage control after Mulvaney remarks Mattis responds to Trump criticism: 'I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals' MORE responded to President Trump calling him \"the world's most overrated general\" during a meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday.\n\nAt the Al Smith Memorial Foundation dinner on Thursday, Mattis opened his speech with a caustic blow about Trump's deferment from the draft during the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I earned my spurs on the battlefield; Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor\" he said.\n\nThe general continued on with the Trump references, stating, \"I'm not just an overrated general. I'm the greatest, the world's most overrated.\" Mattis was the keynote speaker at the 74th annual event.\n\n\"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress.
