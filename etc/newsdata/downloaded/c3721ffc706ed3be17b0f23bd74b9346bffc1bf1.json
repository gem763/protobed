Their actions speak for themselves,\u201d adding, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on cabinet meetings,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you\u2019re doing is for them,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd the idea that you\u2019re going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, should not be negotiating Middle East peace, Mr. Biden said. \u201cWhat credentials does he bring to that?\u201d\n\nWith little more than three months until the first caucus, in Iowa, most national public polls show Mr. Biden leading his top opponents, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, although one poll recently placed Ms. Warren at the head of the pack.\n\nAsked whether he was worried that his opponents were exciting young voters by offering dramatic change, Mr. Biden said that while he wants young people engaged , older voters \u2014 a demographic in which Mr. Biden has considerable support \u2014 will ultimately control the outcome of the nomination ra ce.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly, people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries,\u201d Mr. Biden said.
