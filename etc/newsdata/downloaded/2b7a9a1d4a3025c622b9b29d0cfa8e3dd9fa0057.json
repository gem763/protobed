(Michael B. Lloyd)\n\nFor many Americans, questions about the cost of health care in the United States start when they open their mail to see an unexpected bill or pick up their phone to answer a call from a medical debt collector.\n\nMedical debt is all too common: According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 1 in 5 working-age Americans with health insurance has had problems paying medical bills within the past year, and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau finds that nearly 1 in 5 credit reports include medical collections.\n\nBehind those debts, suggests Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and health policy commentator, is a broken system that can be fixed.\n\n\u201cThe Price We Pay,\u201d his new book, is stuffed with examples of predatory billing, confusing costs and statistics that could make you despondent. But there\u2019s plenty of honesty, problem-solving and hope to leaven all that despair.\n\nMakary paints a grim portrait of American health care, from companies that won\u2019t reveal how much their services cost to unnecessary medical procedures, unneeded diagnoses and medications that shouldn\u2019t be prescribed. He asks how the industry lost sight of its \u201csacred mission\u201d: caring for people who need help.\n\nThen he lays out a potential solution: honesty. Organizations that insist on transparency and measure performance can lead the way to a revitalized, more common-sense system, he suggests.\n\n\u201cPeople blame doctors, hospitals, payers, pharma, device companies, and even patients for not taking better care,\u201d Makary writes. \u201cBut every one of us in health care, every stakeholder, needs to look inward and address the waste in our own backyard.\u201d\n\nThough Makary\u2019s calls for more market \u201cdisruption\u201d feel familiar, his argument for a return to medicine\u2019s mission is fresh indeed. Individuals must demand transparent pricing; physicians and hospitals must promise to avoid unnecessary procedures. But if everyone recommits and pitches in, he suggests, there might just be a way to stop the medical madness.\n\nRead more\n\nAs price of insulin soars, Americans caravan to Canada for lifesaving medicine\n\nAmericans are more focused on health-care costs than Medicare-for-all, poll finds\n\nWorld health, by the quite interesting numbers", "description": "In \u201cThe Price We Pay,\u201d a surgeon says the broken system can be fixed with honesty and a return to common-sense medical service.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore", "September At Am", "Erin Blakemore Is A Freelance Reporter Based In Boulder", "Colo.", "A Frequent Contributor To The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6I8fnfZbV47xhEjt3bcJEASjgyM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZFKEJJGVQMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
