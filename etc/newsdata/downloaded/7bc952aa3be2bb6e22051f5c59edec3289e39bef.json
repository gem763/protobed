The ratings firm Morningstar grabbed headlines this summer by announcing that the amount of assets in so-called \u201cpassively-managed\u201d mutual and exchange-traded funds topped those that are actively managed for the first time.\n\nAmong ETFs in particular, the division is even starker: a whopping 98% of all ETF funds are passively managed, meaning they follow a pre-determined index, an imbalance that often makes it seem like \u201cETF\u201d is synonymous with \u201cpassive.\u201d\n\nBut active investors aren\u2019t conceding defeat. As ETFs mature and the appeal of their structure becomes more accepted, fund managers will increasingly opt to use an ETF framework, rather than a mutual fund, as the backbone for their investing strategies.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of daylight between 98% and 2%, but thanks to regulatory changes and industry innovations, active managers who have long been eager to narrow the gap now have more ways to approach it. That could mean more choices\u2014as well as more difficult decisions\u2014for investors.\n\n\u201cI just think the pendulum has swung so far,\u201d Catherine Wood, CEO and founder of ARK Invest, told MarketWatch in a recent interview. ARK Invest manages five ETFs focused on \u201cdisruptive innovation,\u201d among them the Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG, +1.23% and one focused on Fintech ARKF, -0.06% .\n\n\u201cSo many investors are focused on performing exactly in line with the indexes, but we see so much opportunity that\u2019s future-oriented that\u2019s not captured in the indexes. I think active management is going to have its day in the sun and the indexers will lag behind innovation,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Three fund managers may soon control nearly half of all corporate voting power, researchers warn\n\nBorn from a crisis\n\nTo properly consider the future of ETFs, it\u2019s important to understand their past.\n\nETFs were born in the aftermath of the 1987 crash known as \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d The Securities and Exchange Commission wanted a single tradable security that represented the entire stock market to offer liquidity in the hope of preventing future market meltdowns.\n\n\u201cSo many investors are focused on performing exactly in line with the indexes. But we see so much opportunity that\u2019s future-oriented that\u2019s not captured in the indexes.\u201d Cathie Wood, ARK Invest\n\nThe first-ever ETF, the SPDR S&P 500 fund, SPY, +0.26% debuted in 1993 and is far and away the most popular ETF of any type, with nearly $275 billion in assets under management and a daily average volume of almost $18 billion, according to FactSet data.\n\nETFs like SPY have flourished not only because of their rock-bottom fees, but also because they outperform their more expensive counterparts.\n\nA September report from Morningstar showed that only 23% of all active funds topped the average of their passive rivals over the past 10 years. What\u2019s more, the cheapest funds succeeded more than twice as often as the priciest ones (33% versus 14%) during that same period.\n\nRegulatory changes\n\nA September SEC ruling which overhauled the way ETFs are brought to market, in particular eliminating the regulatory distinction between the two categories, may help hasten Wood\u2019s expected \u201cday in the sun\u201d for active funds.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that index-based and actively managed ETFs do not present significantly different concerns,\u201d the SEC wrote. Regulators said they believe the new rule will \u201chelp to provide a more consistent and transparent regulatory framework for ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe rule is a boon to active managers, said David Mann, head of ETF Capital Markets for Franklin Templeton Investments. Franklin has seen investors shy away from products it offers simply because they have the \u201cactive\u201d label despite having the same characteristics, including fees and liquidity, as most passive funds.\n\n\u201c\u2019Passive\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u2018cheap,\u2019 and \u2018active\u2019 doesn\u2019t have to mean \u2018expensive,\u2019\u201d Mann said.\n\nSee: What is an ETF?\n\nBut the rule isn\u2019t just semantic. It also allows active managers access to so-called custom baskets, allowing them to hold securities that may not precisely mimic the ones in their portfolio for when investors buy and sell shares of the fund. That tool was previously only available to passive funds. It will improve liquidity, not just for the issuer, but also for institutional investors who may want to swap shares of certain single securities for a fund that offers more diversification.\n\nIs opacity a step forward?\n\nAnother factor that may boost a renaissance in active funds is a new type of ETF known as \u201cnontransparent.\u201d The new structure offers a way for managers to buy and sell actively in a fund structure many find preferable to mutual funds while revealing their holdings only once a quarter, as mutual funds do. Many active managers view this type of limited disclosure as key: investing holdings and strategies are Wall Street\u2019s secret sauce.\n\n\u201c\u2019Passive\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u2018cheap,\u2019 and \u2018active\u2019 doesn\u2019t have to mean \u2018expensive\u2019\u201d David Mann, Franklin Templeton\n\nSeveral asset managers have signed up to license the product from a company called Precidian, which was the first company to receive SEC approval for its version of the nontransparent approach. But since the new innovations do away with precisely what\u2019s made ETFs so popular, including transparency on holdings and the ability to find an investing flavor that appeals in an index, many analysts aren\u2019t sure what to make of it.\n\nWhile some industry commentary has called nontransparent a solution in search of a problem, Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA, says he has a relatively optimistic view of its prospects. \u201cWe believe there\u2019s an audience of investors that like active managers, or like their own active manager, but don\u2019t have an ETF alternative,\u201d Rosenbluth told MarketWatch.\n\nTo be sure, for people lured away from pricier alternatives to dirt-cheap options like iShares\u2019 answer to SPY, the Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, +0.23% , \u201cthose investors are not coming back,\u201d Rosenbluth said.\n\nBut as long as the asset managers using the new fund structure pass on the savings of running an ETF to their customers, they are likely to also attract investors, Rosenbluth believes.\n\nAdvisors like James Werner, who helps manage about $240 million for high-net-worth households at Austin-based Silicon Hills Wealth Management, love ETFs of all flavors, including active.\n\nOver the years, Silicon Hills has shifted most of its mutual fund business to ETFs, which now represent about two-thirds of the firm\u2019s assets. The firm favors ETFs not just for the lower management fees but also the more favorable tax implications.\n\nWerner sees value in passive strategies that add a layer of active positioning, such as \u201cfactor investing.\u201d With a highly educated, mostly progressive client base, he also appreciates the way ETFs make socially responsible investing accessible.\n\nBut more often than not, Silicon Hills\u2019 decision to use an active strategy is \u201cto generate a little extra income over and above the index or to provide a little more downside protection,\u201d he said. One such example: the \u201cDefined Outcome\u201d buffer products PJUN, +0.15% profiled by MarketWatch in August.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that mutual funds are still a dominant force in their own right. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that 345 mutual funds were launched last year, to 247 ETFs, citing fund-advocacy group Investment Company Institute. And mutual funds still maintain nearly $20 trillion in assets under management as of Aug. 31, according to Morningstar data.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s why ETFs can\u2019t bring down the financial system, iShares says", "description": "As ETFs mature and the appeal of their structure becomes more accepted, fund managers will increasingly opt to use an ETF framework, rather than a mutual...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT326_active_ZG_20191015114813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
