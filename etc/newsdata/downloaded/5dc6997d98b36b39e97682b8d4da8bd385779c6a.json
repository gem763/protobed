Impeachment Inquiry in Focus", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.\n\nInvesting.com - The U.S. dollar was largely unchanged on Friday in Asia as investors remained cautious over recent developments related to an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe U.S. dollar last traded at 98.825 by 11:30 PM ET (03:30 GMT), down 0.1%.\n\nA House committee released a whistleblower report that alleges Trump tried to get Ukraine to investigate the son of former VP Joe Biden, who is one of the top candidates for the 2020 presidential election. The report claims that the White House had tried to lock down a transcript of the call between Trump and the Ukrainian President, which was released Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative had started the impeachment inquiry earlier this week over the allegations.\n\nOn the Sino-U.S. trade front, Beijing\u2019s top diplomat said the country is willing to purchase more U.S.-made goods.\n\nWang Yi, China\u2019s foreign minister, said in response to questions from Reuters that trade discussions could yield results if both China and the U.S. \"take more enthusiastic measures\" to show goodwill and reduce \"pessimistic language\" in their trade dispute.\n\nHe said Washington has shown goodwill by easing tariffs on a range of Chinese products.\n\nThe USD/CNY pair inched up 0.1% to 7.1332.\n\nThe GBP/USD pair inched down 0.1% to 1.2329 amid fresh uncertainty over European Central Bank policy after the resignation late Wednesday of Sabine Lautenschlaeger.\n\nThe pound was also under pressure on reports cited European Union's Brexit negotiator, who said Britain had yet to provide \"legal and operational\" proposals for an agreement on exiting the bloc.\n\nThe AUD/USD pair traded 0.1% higher to 0.6754 ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s meeting next Tuesday. The central bank is expected to deliver a interest rate cut.\n\nThe USD/JPY pair slipped 0.1% to 107.73.", "description": "Forex - U.S. Dollar Unchanged; Trade Developments.
