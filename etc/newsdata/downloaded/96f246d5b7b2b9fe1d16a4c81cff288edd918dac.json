The NGO Verdeluz has reported 21 turtle deaths in Ceara alone as a result of the spill.\n\nTamar, a group dedicated to the protection of sea turtles, has said the leakage was \"the worst environmental tragedy\" it has encountered since its formation in 1980.", "description": "A huge oil spill off Brazil's northeastern coast may have involved a \"ghost ship\" carrying Venezuelan oil in breach of US sanctions, an expert close to the probe into the disaster said Tuesday.
