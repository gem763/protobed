This post is therefore an objective arrangement of basic nutritional information'\n\n'For optimal health, excessive consumption of fast food is not going to be particularly beneficial. But if consumption is moderate and accompanied by an overall supportive dietary process, it can have an enjoyed position in one\u2019s life.\n\nHe went on to say how the public should be aware of the total energy consumed in a Nando's as it will allow individuals to have a successful diet.\n\n'Once the hard nutritional facts of a Nando's meal are grasped, one can adjust prior and subsequent nutritional intakes to accommodate what will likely be a calorie dense meal in happiness and calm control,' he said.\n\n'Such an eating episode can be free from guilt and enjoyed in serene knowledge that the fruits of the overall diet will yield progress.'\n\nGraeme Tomlinson, aka The Fitness Chef, has analysed the caloric offerings in Nando's most popular dishes, and told how it fares better than many other express dine-in chains\n\nChoose well and the high-street chain can serve up protein-rich, lean chicken, which is a good choice if you're watching the pounds\n\nAnd while most of the chicken served is lean and low in calories, Graeme warned against sides and starters that are high in calories, which could lead to meals being over 2000 calories.\n\nWhile Peri-Peri nuts are often seen as a small snack to graze on before the main meal arrives, the small portion contains a staggering 793 calories, while a large chips is 1256 calories - more than half an adult female requires in a day.\n\nNANDO'S: LIGHTEST AND HEAVIEST DISHES The lightest: A quarter chicken leg has just 265 calories The heaviest: A whole chicken with large chips has the combined calories of 2412\n\nMeanwhile, the hummus, pitta, and peri peri drizzle is 819 calories, while a large spicy rice is 492 calories.\n\nThose opting for a healthier option could go for a saucy spinach, at just 98 calories, or some long stem broccoli, which is only 24 calories.\n\nGraeme added: 'In comparison to many express dine-in establishments, consumption of chicken, coupled with assortments of nutrient-dense foods, may lead one to believe that Nando's is the \"fat loss\" alternative. And this may well prove valid if it is enjoyed.\n\n'However, instances such as the accumulation of 1/2 a peri peri hummus starter, ten wings, regular chips, macho peas and extra sauce = a caloric intake of 1845 nutrient-inclusive calories. But nonetheless... 1845 calories before drinks are considered'.", "description": "Graeme Tomlinson, 31, from Aberdeen, who is known online as The Fitness Chef, says that if you're trying to lose weight opt for the quarter chicken leg, or butterfly chicken, when visiting Nando's.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20288358-0-image-a-40_1572281375506.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
