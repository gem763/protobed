They came, they baked and they definitely left a mark.\n\nThe tent experience feels like the journey Frodo took through Middle-earth to Mordor. There\u2019s always going to be obstacles (Orcs and monsters alike), but as humans we learn to survive and persevere no matter the conditions.\n\nIt was never going to be an easy challenge but they all did really well and have now joined quite a unique family.\n\nThe final episode was a roller coaster of emotions and magnified the good, the bad and the ugly of tent life.\n\nThere are days when it just won\u2019t go right, despite your best efforts and good intentions \u2013 and unfortunately Steph had that during the final.\n\nFortunately, those moments also highlight the brilliant magic that each baker experiences when they step into the tent. As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s the least competitive competition I know and there is always a welcoming shoulder to lean on \u2013 even Paul\u2019s apparently!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a hard one when bakes go wrong and you\u2019re watching the person next to you struggle. It\u2019s natural to want to help and, although we\u2019re restricted in how much we can do, even the smallest gesture helps someone get back on track.\n\nWe saw it this season early on, with the tent gathering around Priya and Jamie\u2019s workstations during biscuit week. And in Liam\u2019s season in 2017 there was also a biscuit week rescue for Tom.\n\nMaybe companies should start doing biscuit week team building sessions.\n\nI look forward to getting to know this year\u2019s contestants (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nBaking, at its core, is about uniting people \u2013 and I think that\u2019s been reflected in every season of GBBO.\n\nI started baking when I was at uni and it was a great way to bring my friends together and also meet new people who I can proudly call great friends today. Plus everyone likes free cake!\n\nMy time in the tent gave me 11 new friends. We\u2019re lucky to still see each other regularly and that friendship circle has only expanded as I\u2019ve met other Bake Off alumni through various functions.\n\nPeople who love baking tend to share the same traits: they\u2019re warm, inclusive and want to help those around them.\n\nThey make great friends and it means the extended GBBO family is a brilliant one to be part of.\n\nA perfect example of this is my latest venture with Val \u2013 my favourite OAP \u2013 as ambassadors for ShareThyme, to encourage youth to bake with the older and wiser people in their lives and spend time together. It perfectly sums up what baking is really about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo watch the season 10 finale and celebrate 10 years of Bake Off, I gathered some fellow alumni for the viewing party in London. It was a brilliant chance to catch up, see how everyone\u2019s getting on and reminisce over the journey we\u2019ve been through.\n\nWe\u2019ll be looking forward to adding this year\u2019s bakers to the ranks!\n\nFor finalists Alice, Steph, David and this year\u2019s bakers, venturing into the world after the end of Bake Off will probably be a relief as their TV life (still suspended in British Summer Time) can finally catch up with real life.\n\nThis is just the beginning, but if I could offer them some words of wisdom, it would be pick the people who help you through this next stage wisely and enjoy the opportunities that come with it.\n\nBut most importantly, don\u2019t let the hype get to you. At the end of the day it\u2019s a beautiful privileged journey, which is borne from a love of cake and baking. No matter what happens, that passion is what really matters.\n\nOh \u2013 and never trust anyone who doesn\u2019t love cake!\n\nTo quote Jay-Z, the greatest rapper ever \u2013 \u2018All I got is dreams, nobody else believes, nobody else can see and nobody else but me.\u2019 Dream big bakers, the world is your oyster and welcome to the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig Bear Love and Hugs, Selasi\n\nMORE: Great British Bake Off 2019 winner David Atherton breaks silence after fans claim Steph Blackwell was \u2018robbed\u2019\n\nMORE: Bake Off finalists: How old are Steph, Alice and David?\n\nMORE: Love Island fans fume as India Reynolds grabs Tommy Fury\u2019s knee in cosy snap", "description": "In his column, Selasi Gbormittah talks about making friends for life on Bake Off.", "authors": ["Selasi Gbormittah", "Great British Bake Off Semi-Finalist"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EIEwkJPWwAAvJ6d-f3f6_1572434988.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
