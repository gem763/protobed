The only other public school besides Penn State to make the top 10 is the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPenn State, which has more than 41,000 enrolled students, is ranked the No. 52 best university in America by U.S. News for its robust undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\nIt has been recognized elsewhere as one of the top 10 universities in the country for producing Fortune 500 CEOs, including Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead and CH2M CEO Jacqueline Hinman. And one of Penn State's richest alums, Terrence Pegula, who is worth $4.3 billion, owns the Buffalo Sabres and the Buffalo Bills.\n\nLinkedIn also finds that, by far, the most popular field of study for CEOs was computer science. While \"the most common starting place for these CEOs was a consulting job,\" numerous CEOs began as software engineers, too.\n\n\"One thing is for sure, millennials are interested in moving up,\" director of insights for LinkedIn Talent Solutions Sarah O'Brien tells CNBC Make It. \"By looking at the path of leaders at some of the top companies globally, [this analysis] can help provide insights into what moves they should consider taking now to get there in the future.\"\n\nTo help you choose a career you can thrive in for years to come, check out the 10 best and worst jobs for the future.\n\nLike this story?
