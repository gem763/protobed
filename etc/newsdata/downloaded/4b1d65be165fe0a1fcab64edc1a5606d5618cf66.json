Warldorf Arcade was cordoned off and protesters started moving their belongings to a nearby church.\n\n- Migrant magnet -\n\nSouth Africa is home to 268,000 refugees and asylum seekers, according to government statistics. They are mainly from Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and DR Congo.\n\nThe country boasts one of the world's most advanced asylum-seeking laws, allowing foreigners to apply for refugee status within the country itself and to work during the process.\n\nBut the United Nations has voiced concern over the more than 50,000 pending asylum claims -- the highest in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nRights groups say the number of people granted refugee status has remained unchanged for the past decade, suggesting an intentional culling of foreign national acceptance.\n\nAs the continent's most industrialised economy, South Africa is also a magnet for migrants seeking better job prospects.\n\nSeen as competing with locals for jobs, foreigners are often the first to come under fire when South Africa's chronic unemployment and inequality boils into resentment.\n\nXenophobic violence left at least 62 dead in 2008. Seven people were killed in 2015 and 12 died in the latest spate of attacks this year -- most of them South African. The incidents occurred mainly in the Johannesburg area.", "description": "South African police on Wednesday arrested around 100 foreign nationals occupying an office building in Cape Town as part of a sit-in protest against xenophobia.
