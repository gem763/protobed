Reversing a 1.21% fall from Wednesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,452.\n\nA bearish start to the morning saw Bitcoin slide to a mid-morning intraday low $10,064. Holding well above the first major support level at $9,892.67, Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $10,488.\n\nBitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $10,378.67 to test resistance at $10,500.\n\nWhile failing to break through to $10,500 levels, Bitcoin managed to hold onto $10,400 levels in spite of a late pullback.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the extended bullish trend remained intact. Bitcoin continued to hold above the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 having steered well clear of sub-$9,000 levels and the 62% FIB of $7,245.\n\nThe Rest of the Pack\n\nAcross the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag.\n\nBitcoin Cash ABC (+0.59%), Binance Coin (+0.58%), Ethereum (+1.56%), and Monero\u2019s XMR (+0.54%) joined Bitcoin in the green on the day.\n\nIt was red for the rest of the pack, however, with Litecoin and Stellar\u2019s Lumen leading the way down. Litecoin fell by 0.80%, with Stellar\u2019s Lumen falling by 0.95%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance held at 70.3%, supported by the upward momentum on the day.\n\nOn Thursday, the total crypto market cap recovered from Wednesday\u2019s current week low $257.9bn to hit a day high $266.17bn. In spite of the recovery, more support is needed to recover to $267bn levels seen at the start of the week.\n\nAt the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $265.37bn.\n\nThere were no major news events to provide the market split and Bitcoin support on the day.\n\nOn the Bitcoin ETF front, SEC Chairman Clayton spoke in the early part of the week, saying that progress has been made on addressing SEC concerns. He also noted, however, that concerns over price manipulation remained. His comments suggested that Bitcoin was likely to remain in limbo for some time to come.\n\nA number of SEC deadlines are set for October on the Bitcoin ETF front\u2026\n\nKey near-term is for Bitcoin to break out from $10,000 levels to avoid a reversal in the final quarter.\n\nThis Morning\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.42% to $10,408. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $10,475 before falling to a low $10,408.\n\nBitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\nElsewhere, Ripple\u2019s XRP bucked the trend early, rising by just 0.06%.\n\nIt was red for the rest of the pack. Monero\u2019s XMR and Stellar\u2019s Lumen led the way down with 1.1% and 1.55% losses respectively.\n\nFor the Bitcoin Day Ahead\n\nBitcoin would need to hold above $10,350 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $10,605.33.\n\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break through to $10,500 levels.\n\nBarring a broad-based crypto rally, we would expect Bitcoin to come up short of $10,600 levels for a 7th consecutive day.\n\nIn the event of a breakout, a move through the first major resistance level would bring $10,700 levels into play.\n\nFailure to steer clear of $10,350 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,181.33 into play.\n\nBarring an extended sell-off through the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $9,910.67.\n\nGet Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "It\u2019s a bearish start to the day for the majors.
