According to researchers for the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s Economic Mobility Project, it\u2019s the child\u2019s family circumstances, with schools ranking as the second-most important factor.\n\nIn the U.S., family circumstances and schools are closely linked, because most cities and counties link schooling to housing. The extent to which families can select schools is largely determined by the extent to which they can afford to select their neighborhood.\n\nThis arrangement effectively limits the prospects of upward mobility for millions of children across the country.\n\nIn 2013, the real estate brokerage firm Redfin analyzed more than 400,000 home sales. It found that, on average, families paid $50 more per square foot for houses in highly rated school districts.\n\nIn one case, Redfin found a house priced $130,000 more than its \u201ctwin\u201d (in terms of square footage and number of rooms) less than a mile away. The main difference? The first was in a highly rated school district; the other was not.\n\nAlthough the Redfin study did not control for other potential confounding variables, its findings underscore what we all already know: housing choice is school choice.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s largest school districts give families no alternative to the nearest public school. They offer no charter schools, no school vouchers \u2013 no school choice programs of any kind. Instead, kids are consigned to a dysfunctional school.\n\nFourth graders in Baltimore and Philadelphia public schools are reading more than two grade levels behind their peers nationally, according to the Nation\u2019s Report Card. Detroit\u2019s fourth-graders are reading nearly four grades behind their peers.\n\nYet parents in large public school districts often have even bigger concerns than whether Johnny can read. They\u2019re worried more about their children\u2019s safety. And with good reason.\n\nFrom September through December last year, Chicago Public Schools dealt with more than 600 allegations of sexual violence. In the year before that, 10 percent of high school students in Washington, D.C., public schools were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property.\n\nNationwide, the National Center for Education Statistics reported more than 827,000 incidents of crime among students aged 12 to 18, including sexual assault, robbery and theft.\n\nUpward mobility doesn\u2019t just require that schools keep students safe and teach them to read; it requires that schools imbue students with that cultural currency that will enable them to be productive members of a free society.\n\nHere, too, many public schools are failing. Today, one-third of Americans \u2013 the vast majority products of our public schools \u2013 cannot name a single branch of government.\n\nNor is an uptick in civic literacy visible anywhere on the horizon. Instead, public schools seem more interested in introducing their pupils to leftist ideology than in teaching basic civics.\n\nUnsurprisingly, California is leading the way in this endeavor. After introducing a much-derided sex education framework earlier this year (with no opt-out for families), the Golden State has now introduced an ethnic studies curriculum that brings the social justice warrior mentality of grad schools to grade schools.\n\nWilliamson Evers of the Hoover Institution calls it training for \u201cideological activists and proponents of identity politics.\u201d\n\nInez Stepman of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum wrote that with its references to terms like \u201ccis-heteropatriarchy\u201d and its broadside against capitalism, the curriculum \u201creads as though ripped from a Berkeley seminar on \u2018critical whiteness studies.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll this while, as my colleague Jonathan Butcher points out, 57 percent of California\u2019s black fourth-graders cannot read at even a basic level.\n\nThese disappointing outcomes support the notion that public education is actually hindering upward mobility for its students.\n\nWhen government assigns children to schools that are failing every test of quality \u2013 safety, learning, and civic literacy \u2013 it is saddling those kids with lifetime opportunity costs.\n\nYet it need not be that way.\n\nSchool choice programs allow students to attend schools that meet their learning needs. And studies show that when students avail themselves of these options, they develop better both academically and as citizens (as measured by things like political tolerance and civic engagement). Their parents are more satisfied as well.\n\nA near-monopoly education system that denies students access to schools that would better serve them impedes upward mobility in America. It will not get better until we separate housing from schooling, through universal education choice.", "description": "What social institutions have the most immediate and strongest impact on a child\u2019s development and well-being?
