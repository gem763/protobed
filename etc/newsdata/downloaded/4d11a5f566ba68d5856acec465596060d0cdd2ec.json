The Indian playwright has written about acid attacks, sex tapes and her home country\u2019s culture of patriarchal violence. \u201cI have been asked so many times, mostly by men, \u2018Why don\u2019t you write comedies, or plays that celebrate India?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI tell them: on the day that these things don\u2019t happen any more, I will happily start writing bedroom farces.\u201d\n\nHer latest play, When the Crows Visit, takes Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts as its inspiration. This may seem something of a departure, but Chandrasekhar found a surprising degree of affinity within the drama. \u201cHere is a white, male, Norwegian playwright from the 19th century,\u201d she says, \u201cand yet, as an Indian woman in Chennai in the 21st, I find so much resonance in his work.\u201d It is a brilliantly creepy play, building up tension and horror through the crows that bridge the worlds of the living and the dead.\n\nThere is one vital \u2013 and shocking \u2013 twist in her splicing of India with Ibsen. The original featured Mrs Alving and her syphilitic son Oswald, grappling with the awful disease handed down from his father. But in When the Crows Visit, the toxic inheritance comes in the form of sexual violence against women. What\u2019s more, the mother figure, played by Ayesha Dharker, is both a victim of this violence and an enabler. One reference point in the play is the Delhi bus gang rape of 2012. Even though this takes place off stage, the horror is palpable, spreading through the script like a contagion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shocking twist \u2026 When the Crows Visit, based on Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts.

It was imperative that the play be conceived by someone rooted in Indian society, says Rubasingham. \u201cAnu\u2019s not only a brilliant playwright \u2013 she is writing from a place of knowledge and lived experience. Immediately after I got this job, I wanted to commission her.\u201d\n\nYou sense the media fatigue around crimes against women. Outside of the cities, it's just another incident \u2026 candlelit vigils don't happen\n\nChandrasekhar has an important reason to return to the Delhi rape. Sexual violence, she says, has become more rife in India since 2012, despite all the national and international hand-wringing that followed the case. \u201cIt was not a one-off incident. It has happened over and over again since, and has just become more gory, more brutal. But you can sense the media fatigue around the reporting of crimes against women. If it happens outside of the cities, it\u2019s just another incident. The candlelit vigils don\u2019t happen for women in small towns and villages.\u201d\n\nThe resurgence of violence in the country has coincided with the rebirth of its rightwing movement and this, says Chandrasekhar, is complicated by the conflict between modernity and conservatism. \u201cEven 30 or 40 years ago, Indian women were growing up freer than girls are now. My grandmother is a pre-independence woman.\u201d India gained its freedom from Britain in 1947. \u201cShe was brought up on the idealism that women are as important as men for the growth of the country. She sees what\u2019s happening to the women around her and says, \u2018What\u2019s happened to that promise?\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police turn water cannon on protesters outraged by 2012\u2019s fatal Delhi bus rape.

You wonder which century you\u2019re living in, but that\u2019s the thing with India. We live in different centuries at the same time: the 21st and the 18th.\u201d\n\nShe feels that women\u2019s rights are being reeled back around the world, not just in the subcontinent. But it is how this happens locally that interests her as a playwright. In India, the twin privileges of money and parental protection render some women safer than others. \u201cThe most disenfranchised in a lot of societies, not just India, are working-class women,\u201d says Rubasingham. \u201cThe minute you have money and power behind you, you can get out of situations.\u201d\n\nThe women of privilege in Chandrasekhar\u2019s play not only work alongside men in cities, often proving to be better at their jobs, but are also the enablers and protectors of the flawed and violent men around them. Female complicity is an ethically thorny area, I suggest. Was Chandrasekhar worried that the audience might end up blaming the women?\n\n\u201cI, like Ibsen, am just trying to be faithful to my society\u2019s dynamics,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated by how culture and patriarchy expresses itself in how women are supposed to behave \u2013 and I think Ibsen was too.\u201d\n\nSo was Ibsen grappling with \u201cthe woman question\u201d as it was labelled in his time? Could he be considered a feminist playwright? And is that why we are seeing female directors and writers increasingly adapting his works? These have included Tanika Gupta, who recently relocated A Doll\u2019s House to 19th-century India; Cordelia Lynn, who turned Hedda Gabler into the far older Hedda Tesman; and Rubasingham herself, who directed Samuel Adamson\u2019s Wife, another reworking of A Doll\u2019s House.\n\n\u201cHe was ahead of his time,\u201d says Rubasingham. \u201cWhat he was really writing about was the tension between the individual and society. Just take A Doll\u2019s House \u00ad\u2013 a woman breaking all society norms and leaving her husband in that time was unheard of.\u201d Chandrasekhar first read the play decades ago and its resonance has never left her. \u201cTo me, Ibsen\u2019s up there with Shakespeare, because it doesn\u2019t matter which era or what culture you are living in, you find him speaking to you as a contemporary.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Call centres and debt ... Disconnect. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nDespite her love of literature as a young woman, Chandrasekhar came to playwriting circuitously. She started off as a news journalist but ended up on a business publication, dissatisfied by its focus on money and restrictive language. Yet it was this background in reporting that fed her social conscience when she began writing plays. After doing a part-time British Council course in Chennai, she got a fellowship at London\u2019s Royal Court and her career was born in earnest. \u201cI saw people my age doing important things and saw how important they felt their voices were to their own countries. I felt I could be part of this. I could matter.\u201d\n\nHer first \u2013 and much celebrated \u2013 UK play was 2007\u2019s Free Outgoing, which dramatised the insidious power of the internet, as a teenager\u2019s sex tape is circulated around her school in Chennai (or Madras, as the capital city of Tamil Nadu state was formerly known). The same year in India, Acid was staged by the Madras Players, featuring the horrific titular attacks on women. Then came Disconnect, again set in Chennai \u2013 this time in a call centre that collects credit card debt \u2013 which revolves around a young call centre worker who becomes romantically fixated on a debt-ridden librarian in Illinois.\n\nThe threats to political theatre in India: fundamentalism and escapism Read more\n\nHer work has not been cancelled or gatecrashed by the police, but she is constantly under pressure to tone it down or remove its contentions. Yet she resists. There is certainly a rising generation of bold young women writers in India, she says, even if they are not all playwrights \u2013 but #MeToo is not having the same impact it had in the west. \u201cFor instance, a Tamil singer outed a very famous lyricist and you\u2019d think that the whole of society would support her. It didn\u2019t. She has been banned by the industry and he\u2019s doing the things he always did. Her career has been destroyed. She\u2019s not the only person you see this happening to. Women are speaking, but they are being punished for it. This is the difference.\u201d", "description": "Her dramas confront the growing horrors facing women in India today.
