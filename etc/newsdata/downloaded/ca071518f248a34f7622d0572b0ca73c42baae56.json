Now she\u2019s blaming the language on a digital media company she said was hired to work on it.\n\nThe initial ad run by state Sen. Amanda Chase, who represents Chesterfield County, read, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to shoot down gun groups.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Friday, Chase called the \u201cludicrous unauthorized\u201d message a mistake, releasing an edited ad that reads, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to shoot down any attacks by anti-gun groups, because gun rights are women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to the senator, the change isn\u2019t meant to be a mea culpa.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with me toning down my message; it has everything to do with the digital media company we just recently hired screwing up our original approved ad,\u201d she said, accusing the company of altering the approved ad after it was submitted.\n\nHowever, not everyone is accepting Chase\u2019s explanation, and her Democratic opponent Amanda Pohl tweeted that it was an example of her \u201cdangerous rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cGun violence prevention advocates and constituents deserve an apology not excuses,\u201d Pohl wrote.\n\nChase\u2019s first ad has also sparked backlash from the state\u2019s Democratic party, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring and Parkland, Florida, shooting survivor David Hogg, who called out the senator online.\n\nOn the same day that @GiffordsCourage endorsed over 40 Virginia Democrats, @AmandaChaseVA released an ad saying she would \"shoot down\" gun violence prevention groups\n\n\n\nInciting violence like this is beyond dangerous. She needs to delete the adhttps://t.co/x1wEne2zy1 \u2014 Virginia Democrats (@vademocrats) September 20, 2019\n\nIf you're as disgusted by this as I am, then support our Democratic nominee @pohlforvirginia. She's been named a \"Gun Sense Candidate\" by @MomsDemand and she'll be a voice and a vote for commonsense gun safety measures.
