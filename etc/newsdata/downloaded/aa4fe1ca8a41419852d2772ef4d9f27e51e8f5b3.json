Ana Blazic Pavlovic\n\nBut research by Chinese scientists who looked at the health records of more than 36,000 people in the US found those who were obese after 47, but went on to lose their excess weight, were more likely to die earlier than those who stayed overweight.\n\nThey linked weight loss in that age group to a 30 per cent increased risk of mortality. Putting weight on in middle age and later life, conversely, was not associated with premature death.\n\nThe biggest risk came for those who had been obese throughout adulthood, with early death rates increasing by 72 per cent, suggesting it is not just gaining weight that matters, but also the stage of life. Researchers say the study shows the risks associated with weight loss become more pronounced as people grow older. Writing in the British Medical Journal, the authors said: \"Stable obesity across adulthood, weight gain from young to middle adulthood, and weight loss from middle age to late adulthood are associated with increased risks of mortality.", "description": "Scientists discover obese people who diet after 47 tend to die earlier than those who stay overweight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_8/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce8dc94d43865a585159602bc7f6ca3b83213743", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
