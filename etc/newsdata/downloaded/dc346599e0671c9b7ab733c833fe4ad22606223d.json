But they said it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to read that more of their loved ones could have been saved if the building was evacuated earlier.\n\nThe long-delayed report into the blaze that claimed 72 lives was released on Wednesday morning by the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick and was branded \u201cstrong\u201d by Grenfell United which represents hundreds of members of the community affected by the 14 June 2017 disaster. The group said the London fire brigade\u2019s failure to prepare and plan for a cladding fire and evacuation, described by Moore-Bick as \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d, was a breach of national guidance and the LFB\u2019s leadership must now \u201cstop hiding behind the bravery of their front line fire fighters [and] ... face consequences for these failings if there is to be change\u201d.\n\nThe survivors said rank and file firefighters, rather than being scapegoated in the report, were let down by their training, procedures, equipment and leadership. Moore-Bick\u2019s conclusion that the refurbishment of the tower completed in 2016 with the fixture of combustible cladding broke building regulations adds to their \u201cdetermination to see criminal charges brought against those responsible for turning our homes into a death trap\u201d, they said.\n\n\u201cJustice means different things for all of us but the truth needs to be at the heart of our collective healing. We have been waiting a long time for this report. Today\u2019s findings give us some confidence that our journey towards truth has finally begun. We now need to urgently see responsibility and action from this report, not excuses. One of the most worrying findings is Sir Martin Moore-Bick\u2019s view that the LFB are currently an institution at risk of not learning the lessons from Grenfell.\u201d\n\nUnveiling the report, Moore-Bick called for urgent action by the government to improve safety in high rise blocks and in a message to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he wanted to see his recommendations, which included improvements in fighting high-rise fires and new national guidelines for evacuating high-rise flats, implemented without delay.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sir Martin Moore-Bick, pictured in 2018, called the LFB\u2019s planning \u2018gravely inadequate\u2019. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n\n\u201cGrenfell Tower was home to a strong and vibrant community that was torn apart by the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some cases whole families died and many people are mourning relatives friends and neighbours with whom they shared their lives.\u201d\n\nMoore-Bick found:\n\nBehailu Kebede, in whose fourth floor flat the fire started, was not at fault.\n\nThe principle reason the fire spread was the aluminium composite cladding filled with plastic used on the building exterior.\n\nFirefighters showed \u201ccourage and devotion to duty\u201d and 999 call operators were \u201cunstinting\u201d in their efforts to help trapped residents.\n\nIncident commanders were not trained to cope with the fire and there was no contingency plan for evacuation\n\nThe LFB failed to lift the stay put advice when the stairs remained passable , which cost lives\n\nThe brigade suffered \u201csignificant systemic failings\u201d.\n\nCommunications systems failed and there were serious deficiencies in command and control.\n\nThe survivors said the fact Moore-Bick found the refurbishment breached fire safety regulations means the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea which owned the building, its tenants management organisation and the construction companies involved now have serious questions to answer in the second phase of the inquiry which starts in January and will conduct 18 months of hearings running until the middle of 2021.\n\nIn parallel with the inquiry the Metropolitan police are investigating possible cases of manslaughter and corporate manslaughter, but detectives are not planning to forward evidence to prosecutors for consideration until after the second phase of the public inquiry is complete. It will consider, among other things, the design and construction of the \u00a310m refurbishment between 2014 and 2016 and the government\u2019s role in fire safety both by regulation and provision of effective fire and rescue services.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Teddy bears and signs attached to a fence near Grenfell Tower in London, Wednesday, 30 October Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP\n\nMoore-Bick\u2019s recommendations included requiring high-rise building owners to provide fire brigades with details of external wall materials and building plans, regular inspections of high rises and lifts, national guidelines for evacuations of high rise flats and urgent inspections of fire doors across all multi-occupancy, residential properties.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister must not only accept these recommendations in full, he must also outline how and when he will ensure they are implemented,\u201d Grenfell United said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe must bring in a national evacuation plan for high rises, new laws for building owners and ensure there must be institutional change at the LFB so that lessons are learnt.\u201d\n\nGrenfell United called for more resources for the fire service to make the necessary changes to training and equipment and said: \u201cOur thoughts today are once again with people still sleeping in buildings covered in highly combustible cladding and insulation. This cannot go on any longer. The immediate and real dangers of these materials are now beyond any doubt. Lives are at risk and the government need to treat this as a national emergency.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson said: \u201ctoday, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017. For the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community, this report will prove particularly harrowing. Yet I hope it strengthens their faith in the inquiry\u2019s desire to determine the facts of the fire \u2013 and in this government\u2019s commitment to airing those facts in public, no matter how difficult they may be, and acting on them. That commitment is absolute.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Heartbreaking\u2019 to read more loved ones could have been saved, say bereaved", "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49875fce0599c9144d4baf52afeb6946ee697444/0_0_5855_3513/master/5855.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1847f1cac7446f5ad9c50dd4edb659d4", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
