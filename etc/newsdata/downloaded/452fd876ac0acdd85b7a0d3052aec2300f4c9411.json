Both countries were joined in implementing the new sanctions by Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe U.S. has designated both Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Treasury said recruits child soldiers and tortures those it captures, as terrorist organizations.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the plan to disrupt the financial networks Iran uses to fund terrorism a \u201cpowerful demonstration of Gulf unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud to join forces with our TFTC partners to expose and condemn the Iranian regime\u2019s gross and repeated violations of international norms, from attacking critical oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia to fomenting strife in neighboring countries through regional proxies such as Hizballah,\u201d Mnuchin added. \u201cThis coordinated action is a concrete step towards denying the Iranian regime the ability to undermine the stability of the region.\u201d\n\nThe new sanctions come during Mnuchin\u2019s trip to the Middle East, where he plans to work with Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon on an economic development plan.\n\nThe move is the latest development in the administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran, which has crippled the Iranian economy, although banned trade and terror funding continues to flow into the regime through blackmarket channels.\n\nTensions with Iran have spiked since the Trump administration pulled out of the Obama administration\u2019s Iran nuclear deal in May of last year, and reinstated heavy sanctions on the state terror sponsor. In recent months, the U.S. has placed blame on Iran for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Hormuz as well as the September attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.", "description": "The U.S. and six Gulf nations on Wednesday slapped sanctions on businesses and individuals who have expressed support for Iran's military and the Tehran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Frederick M.
