Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming budget,\u201d he added.\n\nIn analysis ahead of a government budget this autumn, the IFS said the deficit \u2013 the shortfall between government spending and income from taxes \u2013 was already on track to rise to more than \u00a350bn next year from \u00a329.3bn currently, as a result of changes in the treatment of student loans in the national accounts and as Boris Johnson ramps up public spending.\n\nHowever, it said no-deal Brexit could cause economic growth to flatline in 2020-21, even if the Bank of England cut interest rates and the government stepped in with emergency tax cuts and higher spending.\n\nDescribing the scenario emerging from a \u201crelatively benign\u201d no-deal Brexit, the IFS said the budget deficit would rise to almost \u00a3100bn or 4% of GDP by 2021-22, reversing the progress over the past decade of producing gradually smaller deficits.\n\nThe budget deficit peaked in 2009-10 after the banking crisis at almost \u00a3160bn, before gradually falling as David Cameron and George Osborne cut spending using a policy of austerity to reduce it.\n\nThe government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecast this year that the deficit should fall to \u00a321.2bn in 2020-21. However, it made its estimate in March on the basis of a smooth Brexit deal.\n\nSuccessive budget deficits have caused the national debt to rise to about \u00a31.8tn, or about 80% of GDP \u2013 more than double the level before the financial crisis. Although economists debate how sustainable such debt levels are, the IFS said that keeping such a debt level may prevent the country from raising spending on public services in future.\n\nAfter a decade of austerity the IFS said the government\u2019s near-\u00a314bn spending plans outlined by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, at last month\u2019s spending round for 2020-21 would only return public funding for services as a percentage of national income to levels seen in 2006-07.\n\nIt said the plans for day-to-day spending next year had taken Conservative policy close to offering the same level of funding for public services implied by Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe IFS said the government had in effect abandoned the former chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s borrowing rules, including a Conservative manifesto pledge to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cSeptember\u2019s spending round supported the people\u2019s priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.\u201d", "description": "IFS says public borrowing will more than double next year whatever the Brexit result", "authors": ["Richard Partington", "Larry Elliott Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc96a16dfed7c8a44b3f89b2a4c5658400864642/0_130_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c0b18a50bae3bd43887095f00600687", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
