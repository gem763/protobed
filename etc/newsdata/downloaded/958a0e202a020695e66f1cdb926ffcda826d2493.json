But with the USA taking on England in what will be only their sixth encounter \u2013 and first for 12 years \u2013 former Bath, Newcastle and Worcester boss Gold suggested that the death of the Nations Championship doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the attempt to bring the developing and established international teams closer together.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

If there were a solution where we could potentially play them a lot more regularly that\u2019s not necessarily the Nations Cup\u2026 maybe after the Six Nations and before the Rugby Championship in that July window there could be a window where tier one teams play tier two teams, and we welcome them to our country. An England or Ireland or Scotland or Australia or New Zealand could come to America and play a few Tests there as a preparation for the Rugby Championship, or post-Six Nations.\u201d\n\nThe issue has taken a spotlight once again following the impressive showings by the smaller nations at Japan 2019. The current tournament is on course to be the third-lowest scoring World Cup ever, and with not a single team clearing the 50-point barrier yet, it\u2019s fair to look at the likes of Tonga and Fiji and argue that their continuing improvement is justification to bring nations together in some format, be it regular test series or one global championship.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking the tier two countries have been more competitive,\u201d said England boss Eddie Jones when asked for his standout opinion of the World Cup so far. It was Jones of course who lead Japan to the greatest upset in World Cup history when they beat South Africa four years ago, and Gold paid tribute to what his team achieved to show the rest of the tier two nations of what can be achieved.\n\nGold also went as far to suggest that if Japan fail to make the quarter-finals \u2013 at what would likely be the expense of Scotland \u2013 it should be classed as a surprise.\n\n\u201cThe work that Eddie has done has helped put rugby on the map,\u201d Gold added. \u201cI think the Rugby World Cup is just going to accelerate that even further. I think you can probably see Japan rugby being the supposed tier two team that are going to improve the greatest and the quickest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll really be surprised if they don\u2019t qualify for the quarter finals of this Rugby World Cup.\u201d\n\nWhile the dream for the US is to follow that lead, the next big step in their development \u2013 as it was Japan\u2019s \u2013 looks to be hosting the World Cup itself. It\u2019s understood that America is firmly in the running to host the tournament in 2027 or 2031, with World Rugby determined to expand into a previously untapped territory, and with the advantage of its own professional league behind it in Major League Rugby, Gold believes hosting the tournament will improve rugby union across the States as it did football in 1994.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking that we\u2019ve got to improve our game enough in order to deserve to host a Rugby World Cup, I actually see it as the other way around,\u201d Gold explained. \u201cIf the USA were able to host the Rugby World Cup in 2027 or 2031, I think that would give a lift to the game. There\u2019s certainly enough interest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a couple of years ago when Ireland came to the States and even when the All Blacks came to the States, even though the Eagles got hammered in that game, it sold out Soldier Field.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly enough folk in the States who love the game of rugby and they want to see us play better teams.\u201d", "description": "United States\u00a0head coach Gary Gold wants games like tomorrow\u2019s Rugby World Cup clash against England\u00a0to become a mainstay of the international calendar, and believes post-Six Nations and pre-Rugby Championship tours could be the ideal way to increase competition across the globe.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/09/gary-gold.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
