I still remember the first time I heard it on the radio, riding in my dad\u2019s \u201886 red Chevy Nova as a child.\n\n\"No One Needs to Know\" \u2013 Shania Twain\n\nI sang this song at my first talent show performance (at age 12). I was obsessed with Shania. I sang to a karaoke version, wore cowboy boots, a fringe suede jacket and bandana around my neck with choreographed hand movements.\n\n\"When You Say Nothing At All\" \u2013 Alison Krauss\n\nThis song was written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz but I first heard Alison Krauss\u2019 version. Her voice is hauntingly beautiful.\n\n\"Wings Upon Your Horns\" \u2013 Loretta Lynn\n\nLoretta was gutsy and wrote about women\u2019s issues, which was incredibly racy at the time. She\u2019s still a role model and inspiration to be outspoken and honest.\n\n\"Strawberry Wine\" \u2013 Deana Carter\n\nThis song is perfect for both teenage love and angst.\n\n\"Forever Yours\" \u2013 Tammy Wynette\n\nThe ache and pain in Tammy\u2019s voice hurts deeply in my heart every time, in a very good way.\n\n\"It Wasn\u2019t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" \u2013 Kitty Wells\n\nI mean, is there more to say than just 'This is required listening'?\n\n\"Strange\" \u2013 Patsy Cline\n\nI love so many songs Patsy recorded, especially because she didn\u2019t always play a country shuffle. This is a great example of a country clubhouse rumba, not very common in the country music canon.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/07/playlist-michaela-annes-favorite-female-country-throwbacks/3785684002/", "description": "Nashville rising star Michaela Anne is celebrating the release of her new album \"Desert Dove.\"", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published A.M.
