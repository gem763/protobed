As Faraday used to say: Talk to a stranger on a bus!\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nWe closed the day, October 19 2019, at a price of $7,988. That\u2019s a minor 0.18 percent increase in 24 hours, or $14. It was the highest closing price in one day.\n\nWe\u2019re still 60 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).\n\nBitcoin market cap\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $143,808,163,807. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.\n\nBitcoin volume\n\nYesterday\u2019s volume of $13,797,825,640 was the lowest in twelve days, 10 percent below the year\u2019s average, and 69 percent below the year\u2019s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 288 tons of gold.\n\nBitcoin transactions\n\nA total of 304,594 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 9 percent below the year\u2019s average and 32 percent below the year\u2019s high.\n\nBitcoin transaction fee\n\nYesterday\u2019s average transaction fee concerned $0.18. That\u2019s $3.53 below the year\u2019s high of $3.71.\n\nBitcoin distribution by address\n\nAs of now, there are 11,789 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.\n\nCompany with a market cap closest to Bitcoin\n\nWith a market capitalization of $145 billion, Medtronic has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s path towards $1 million\n\nOn November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.\n\nHe even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn\u2019t. Unfortunately for him it\u2019s 93.3 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin\u2018s price should have been $120,025 by now, according to dickline.info.\n\nBitcoin Energy Consumption\n\nBitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73.12 terawatt hour. That\u2019s the equivalent of Austria\u2019s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world\u2019s electricity use.\n\nBitcoin on Twitter\n\nYesterday 15,757 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That\u2019s 15.5 percent below the year\u2019s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.\n\nMost popular posts about Bitcoin\n\nThis was yesterday\u2019s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:\n\nJUST IN: Taiwanese electronics giant @htc has launched its latest blockchain phone, the Exodus 1s, with the ability to support a full bitcoin node.
