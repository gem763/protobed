In text messages with other U.S. diplomats, Taylor raised alarms about the White House holding back military aid to Ukraine and pressing for investigations into the 2016 U.S. election and an energy company that employed former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney continues to back away from a quid pro quo, as a top diplomat defends Trump personal lawyer Rudolph W.

The Twitter thread urged Trump supporters to \u201cCheck if your Representative is on this list and call them NOW!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump Jr., an outspoken opponent of the impeachment inquiry, has repeatedly taken aim at Schiff on Twitter, including blasting him as \u201c#FullofSchiff.\u201d\n\n9:55 a.m.: Pelosi\u2019s office accuses Trump of having \u2018betrayed his oath of office, betrayed our national security\u2019\n\nPelosi\u2019s office released a four-page \u201cfact sheet\u201d citing the most compelling evidence of what Democrats have cast as a gross abuse of power by Trump.\n\nAD\n\nThe citations are divided into three categories: \u201cthe shakedown,\u201d \u201cthe pressure campaign\u201d and \u201cthe cover up.\u201d\n\nAs evidence of a \u201cshakedown,\u201d the fact sheet cites quotes from the rough transcript from Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which it says \u201cpaints a damning picture of Trump abusing his office by pressing a foreign government to interfere in our 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump, the document contends, \u201chas betrayed his oath of office, betrayed our national security and be\u00adtrayed the integrity of our elections for his own personal political gain.\u201d\n\nThe evidence of a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d includes several texts from State Department officials, including one in which Taylor says, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assis\u00adtance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs of evidence of a \u201ccover up,\u201d the document points to the complaint filed by the whistleblower that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn it, the anonymous U.S. intelligence official asserts that senior White House officials \u201cintervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call\u201d and loaded the transcript into \u201ca separate electronic system \u2026 used to store and handle clas\u00adsified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n9:45 a.m.: GOP Rep. Biggs says censure resolution will let Schiff know \u2018how disappointed we are\u2019\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the lead sponsor of the resolution seeking to censure Schiff, said forcing debate on the issue would let Schiff \u201cknow himself how disappointed we are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiggs\u2019s comments came during an interview on Fox News hours before the House is expected to take up the censure resolution, which is backed by 173 Republicans.\n\nBiggs argued that it is also important for Democrats to go on record about an impeachment process that he criticized for largely taking place behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cIt gives the Democrats an opportunity to show where they are on due process, and they get to say, \u2018Look we\u2019re perfectly content with closed-door impeachment inquiry,\u2019 or they get to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t quite right, and we want to do it the right way.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchiff has said the closed-door depositions are necessary so that witnesses don\u2019t have the benefit of hearing one another\u2019s testimony. Questions are being asked by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and staff, and Schiff has said transcripts will be made public later.\n\nAD\n\nBiggs said Republicans have lost confidence in Schiff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a fair arbiter, and that\u2019s part of what this goes to,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of poisoned the well here.\u201d\n\n9:20 a.m.: Trump continues to insist his golf club is the best location for G-7\n\nTrump continued to insist Monday that his private Miami golf club would have been the best place to host next year\u2019s international Group of Seven summit, two days after he backed off the plan amid criticism from impeachment-weary Republicans.\n\n\u201cDoral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G-7, and free, but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats & their Partner, the Fake News Media!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 Plus Presidential Salary!

That is up from 47 percent in mid-September before the impeachment inquiry was announced.\n\nThe poll finds that 93 percent of Republicans oppose impeachment and removal, a figure virtually unchanged from the previous survey. But support for impeachment among Democrats has jumped 10 percentage points, to 88 percent.\n\nIndependents remained divided, with 49 percent now favoring impeachment, according to the poll.\n\nAD\n\nSupport for impeachment and removal has ranged from 43 percent to 52 percent in other independent national polls released this month.\n\n8 a.m.: House Democrats seek to derail resolution censuring Schiff\n\nHouse Democrats will seek Monday to derail a Republican-backed resolution seeking to censure Schiff for how he has handled the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans pressed the issue last week but lawmakers decided to postpone a vote following the death of House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who was admired on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe resolution, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), takes issue with Schiff\u2019s remarks at a Sept. 26 hearing. Schiff embellished the transcript of the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSchiff later said his remarks were intended as a parody and that Trump and others who have criticized him should have recognized that.\n\nThe resolution, which has the backing of Trump and the House Republican leadership, also takes aim at Schiff for other actions, including some related to the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nShortly after 6:30 p.m., House Democrats are expected to move to table the resolution. If successful, that would prevent a vote on the resolution itself.\n\nTrump urged support for the resolution last week and took fresh aim at Schiff in a tweet on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff is a Corrupt Politician!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet that also included a clip of a television interview in which House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) urged a censure of Schiff.\n\n7 a.m.: Series of closed-door depositions planned this week\n\nHouse investigators are planning closed-door depositions from a parade of witnesses this week, starting Tuesday with acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, considered by Democrats to be a key figure in the probe.\n\nTaylor, in text messages with two other U.S. diplomats, raised alarms about the White House holding back military aid to Ukraine, calling it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\u201d and a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers are expected to hear from Ambassador Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, and Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. Duffey\u2019s signature was on the letters reapportioning the Ukraine aid.\n\nOn Thursday, Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense whose portfolio includes Russia and Ukraine, and Lt.
