That includes sweating the small operational details while at each factory visit (of which there have been many).\n\nMeanwhile, Culp has also drilled down on GE\u2019s bloated cost structure by letting go of underperformers. He has overhauled management and jettisoned businesses for sale, by his own admission, pay down GE\u2019s still too high debt levels.\n\nGeneral Electric Co.

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott More\n\nThe financial results stemming from Culp\u2019s extensive efforts have been mixed at best, underscoring the years of gross mismanagement under former CEO Jeff Immelt. Revenue and profits continue to be dreadful in GE\u2019s all-important Power business. Free cash flow generation remains a problem, too.\n\nGE\u2019s stock has dropped 27% since the company named Culp as CEO, according to Yahoo Finance data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have each gained about 7% during that same span.\n\nCulp and his team continue to downplay the claims made this summer by Bernie Madoff whistleblower \u2014 turn General Electric whistleblower \u2014Harry Markopolos. Recall the forensic accountant said GE is committing financial fraud.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
