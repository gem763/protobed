We asked readers for their views\n\nWhy do women fake orgasms \u2013 and is it anti-feminist? We asked five women\n\nDo you feel uncomfortable saying the word clitoris? Have you faked an orgasm recently? Are you a feminist? These may not seem related, but two recent academic studies linking societal attitudes to faking it suggest they are.\n\nMy life in sex: the partner of a man with erectile dysfunction Read more\n\nThe first showed that women who felt uncomfortable saying the word clitoris were more likely to fake orgasms. The second showed that heterosexual women in relationships who held hostile views about feminism were more likely to fake it.\n\nBut does faking an orgasm really make you anti-feminist? And does being intimidated about accurately naming one\u2019s sex organ have anything to do with what goes on between the sheets? We spoke to five women about whether they fake it to find out more about why.\n\nShelby, 28, South Carolina: \u2018I faked it because I thought that\u2019s how sex ends\u2019\n\nDo you call yourself a feminist? Hell yeah!\n\nDo you feel uncomfortable saying the word clitoris? No.\n\nHave you ever faked it? I can\u2019t think of a specific time, but I know I have.\n\nWhy? Mostly it\u2019s an ending mechanism. I haven\u2019t done it for a long time now, but when I did, it was because I just wasn\u2019t going to get there and it was easier to end it that way.\n\nWhy did you stop faking it? Because I started having a more adventurous sex life with men and women, and I largely stopped having sex with cisgendered men. I used to think the goal of sex was to have an orgasm. Now I just think it\u2019s to have fun. So there is way less pressure on me to fake it because it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t have one.\n\nIs faking it a feminist issue? I have faked orgasms with men and women. I have a theory that you\u2019re less likely to fake it if you can accept yourself, and you can communicate yourself to others. That is tied to feminism because women have a hard time doing that. We are taught not to accept ourselves.\n\nMaddie, 49, New York: \u2018I fake it because I am cheating on my husband\u2019\n\nWould you call yourself a feminist? No. I am glad women are more empowered these days, but feminists make a bigger deal out of it than they need to. I think feminists think women are better than men. I don\u2019t think you qualify for certain things just because you\u2019re a woman, and I don\u2019t put myself above a man.\n\nDo you feel squeamish saying the word clitoris? No. I have no problem talking about sex in any way.\n\nDo you fake orgasms? Yes. There are lots of reasons. Sometimes the guy seems so fragile, he\u2019s just asking how you\u2019re feeling constantly and you can tell he\u2019s not going to stop until you finish. I think they wouldn\u2019t be able to take the truth, so I fake it.\n\nAny other reasons? I am married, but I go outside the marriage because I\u2019m not happy. He doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve slept with anyone else. In fact, he believes we\u2019re each other\u2019s first. I can\u2019t get myself to orgasm with him any more because I don\u2019t feel that way any more.\n\nI have faked it and I would never tell him that, because it will really hurt him, and it will open up a whole can of worms. I\u2019m not looking to hurt him like that.\n\nLast time you faked it? About three weeks ago.\n\nAnita, 51, UK: \u2018Faking it empowers me\u2019\n\nAre you a feminist? Um, no. I see feminism as believing that women are entitled to more than men, and I believe men and women are equal.\n\nHave you ever faked an orgasm? Yes. I was in a relationship for a long time that wasn\u2019t sexually satisfying and the guy was controlling. I found it easier to fake it. But that was the only time I\u2019ve done it.\n\nIs faking it a feminist issue? I think it is, but in the opposite way to what [the study] suggests. I think faking it can make you feel empowered \u2013 because you are in charge of your body and you\u2019re deciding to do it. I used to fake orgasms because it made me feel desirable.\n\nDidn\u2019t you say you did it because you thought it was what the guy wanted, though? Yes. Well, I suppose that is a bit hypocritical. You know what, I\u2019ve changed my mind. Maybe I am a feminist.\n\nLast time you faked it? About 18 years ago. I make much better choices now!\n\nAdaire, 26, Boston: \u2018It made me feel safer to fake it\u2019\n\nDo you call yourself a feminist? I do.\n\nHave you faked an orgasm before? Yes. A lot, when I was in my early 20s.\n\nWhy? Back then I felt like it was easier to pretend. I didn\u2019t want to make the guy feel bad, so I faked it. Sometimes it\u2019s less work to just fake it and get them out. Some men get defensive and angry, like it\u2019s their job to make it happen. I don\u2019t like that, I find it forceful. Sometimes I feel safer faking it because it\u2019s on my own terms.\n\nDo you fake it anymore? No, and I link that to my own feminist education. Feminists have better sex because it\u2019s less about performing and more enjoying it, and just everyone having a good time. Faking it now, I feel like I\u2019m objectifying myself. It\u2019s so performative and that makes me feel gross. When I faked it I was feeling self conscious because I was wondering if I looked good. I would be trying to pout, and arch my back and flip my hair at the same time \u2013 that\u2019s just not real.\n\nAnything else? Here\u2019s a tip for heterosexual men for the future: if your partner looks good while they\u2019re doing it, she\u2019s faking.\n\nLucy, 31, Canada: \u2018I faked it because I thought I was supposed to\u2019\n\nDo you call yourself a feminist? 100%\n\nDoes saying clitoris make you feel uncomfortable? No! I love the word.\n\nHave you ever faked an orgasm? Yes. To begin with, I started doing it because I found it really difficult to orgasm and it seemed like my friends were having a great time \u2013 maybe they were lying \u2013 but I felt like I was failing by not being able to be. It really mattered to me that I was seen as sexy and desirable. I felt like not being able to orgasm made me prudish.\n\nWhat made it worse was one relationship where I cared enough to tell him the truth. He then made it his sole mission to make it happen for me, which was very intense. I felt he was taking it personally. It was all about his ego, not me, and that led to me faking it again.\n\nDo you think faking it a feminist issue? Absolutely. Women fake it because of the societal pressure to be desirable and not to upset others. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anti-feminist to fake it, because we have to accept that in the society we live in, women feel pressured to behave that way.\n\nInterviews have been lightly edited and some names have been changed\n\nHave you ever faked an orgasm?
