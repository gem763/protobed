Enjoy the ride, because anything can happen.", "language": "en", "text": "Some will disagree and cite a need for parades. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m too pleased to argue. I suspect this World Series, regardless of result, will be our touchstone emotional moment: \u201cWashington, meet baseball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMajor league baseball was gone from Washington for so long \u2014 33 years \u2014 and D.C. had gone without a World Series for so many years before that \u2014 38, that I honestly wondered how many people in the District had any sense of what they were missing. And how excited they would be if they ever got it.\n\nThis is the season, and this October is the month, when we will find out the level of bonding, the level of pent-up, or never-tapped, passion, for the sport in the Washington area. For decades, I\u2019ve been curious to find out what that level is. How can you know until it happens?\n\nIf this World Series is as competitive as I think it is going to be \u2014 a six- or seven-game affair between two excellent teams, with Houston a deserved, but not huge, favorite \u2014 I doubt D.C. will know what hit it. Oh, so that is what you\u2019ve been babbling about all these years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA major league season is a seven-month journey. You need the whole experience once \u2014 including all of October \u2014 for the memory to color your anticipation for every future season. So much is condensed in so short a time, fortunes swing so fast, that fans feel they are part of \u201cthe wave\u201d that every Nationals player now says they are riding.\n\nConsider: In 15 days the Nats had three elimination games, won them all and had four champagne-popping celebrations. That\u2019s a quirk of making the playoffs as a wild card, but it\u2019s as many celebrations as the 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017 teams, who all won the NL East, had combined.\n\nBecause the Astros won 107 games, and won the World Series just two years ago, this Series may be a short, unpleasant experience for the 93-win Nats. Plenty will predict that. The Nats have had so many days off (six) that their bats may have gone cold. Meanwhile, the Astros\u2019 rest \u2014 two days \u2014 and their rotation, with Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke lined up for the first three games, is ideal. With home-field advantage, the Astros won\u2019t even have to hop on a jet for Game 1.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHistory also frowns. The Nats can practice those long group hugs because, in a few days, they may need them. Only twice has the Series been won by a team with a deficit of 14 or more wins in the regular season \u2014 the 1954 New York Giants and the 1906 Chicago White Sox.\n\nPerhaps Washington will have to be satisfied with the memories from a team that will be loved for decades for what it has already done, bringing the Series to D.C. for the first time in 86 years after rallying from 12 games under .500 in late May. Pulling off a stunt like that will get you remembered.\n\nHowever, be wise, and be warned: prepare for perspiration, palpitations and some joyous pirouettes, too. Fill that medicine cabinet.\n\nAD\n\nSince league championship series began in 1969, the team with the better regular season mark is 23-24 in the World Series. The \u201cbetter\u201d team has lost more. Since \u201969, 15 World Series looked lopsided because one team had an edge of 10 or more regular season wins \u2014 as is the case now. The \u201cbetter\u201d team has a 7-8 record in those World Series.\n\nAD\n\nOne key factor may be pressure. The Astros have more experience handling it. But the Nats carry little weight of external expectation. High demands are the enemy of \u201cfun\u201d and free-flowing play. Can the Nats truly find that free-wheeling place? While every Nats player passionately wants to win and probably expects to win because they have played so well for so long, no one outside the team demands much of them at all.\n\nWashington is going to love them, and talk about them for decades, whether they win four games from Houston or none. If a lesser team emerged from the AL, that\u2019s a different tone. But the Nats, who have already beaten the 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers, must face the Astros, too. Tall task.\n\nAD\n\nInside the Nats\u2019 clubhouse, where only one player (reliever Hunter Strickland) has played on a Series winner, the attitude will be totally different. Scherzer has been on a ring quest for 14 years and signed with the Nats to improve his chances.\n\nAD\n\nWho is in the Hall of Fame that never won a World Series ring? Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Ken Griffey Jr., Rod Carew, Ernie Banks, Willie McCovey, Harmon Killebrew, Carl Yastrzemski, Juan Marichal, Tony Gwynn, Ryne Sandberg, Frank Thomas and many more. Trust me, players know this.\n\nYou get a chance, you don\u2019t say, \u201cOh, we\u2019re underdogs.\u201d You say, \u201cLet\u2019s take the fight to these guys till the last pitch. This is our shot.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn analyzing this Series, are we looking at the full-season Astros and Nats, or those two teams as constituted now? Players say, \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nMy view \u2014 it\u2019s more fun this way \u2014 since May 23, the Astros, including the postseason, are 81-41 and have scored 691 runs with a plus-182 run differential. The Nats are 82-40 and have scored 700 runs with a plus-203 run differential. I don\u2019t see one exceptional, versatile, mash-or-manufacture offense; I see two multifaceted mirror images.\n\nAD\n\nAdd an X-Factor: NL teams seldom have a natural designated hitter for games in AL cities without denuding their bench. The Nats do with switch hitter Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera (91 RBI), especially against Verlander (21 hits and 11 RBI, both in the top five of active players off the future Hall of Famer) and Greinke, whom he hits even better with a 1.079 on-base-plus-slugging-percentage in 37 at-bats. Also, how much will subtracting a DH limit the Astros in D.C.?\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats\u2019 bullpen has improved recently, but maybe not enough. Reluctant closer Daniel Hudson has a 1.47 ERA in his past 51 games. Since returning from the injured list, Sean Doolittle has a 2.35 ERA in 15 games. Rookie Tanner Rainey has allowed two runs in his past 13 games. Is this group, plus matchups for Rodney, an average bullpen?\n\nMaybe. But how could the Nats get another \u201cstar-starter\u201d arm in their bullpen as in previous series? I doubt they\u2019ll do it, because they aren\u2019t paying Patrick Corbin $140 million to be a middle-inning reliever. But if you ride S\u00e1nchez\u2019s hot hand in Game 3 and (if necessary) 7 and bump Corbin to Game 4, then interesting options appear.\n\nAD\n\nYou could use Corbin for one (or two) innings of relief in Game 1 or 2 (but not in both), and he would still be rested enough for Game 4. He would also have three days of rest to follow S\u00e1nchez in Game 7. By then, Scherzer, on two days\u2019 rest, might go an inning in a Game 7, too.\n\nAD\n\nOh, and Strasburg\u2019s \u201cthrow day\u201d is Game 4. What bullpen problems?\n\nSee, the World Series makes you crazy \u2014 but in wonderful ways.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to say the Astros are simply better than the Nationals.\n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable, at least in my chair, to say that \u2014 with the luck of perfect health, with peak team play in the proper month, and with star starters who will work overtime to get their first rings \u2014 the Nats have risen to the magisterial level of the Astros.\n\nAnd, after so long a wait, this World Series will be played atop that very high hill.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Generations of Washington baseball fans will finally get to experience the Fall Classic in their hometown, and who\u2019s to say it can\u2019t go their way?", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hmWkKX1X544oCVDp5-8LWEoAvnk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K4UAJJXR4QI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
