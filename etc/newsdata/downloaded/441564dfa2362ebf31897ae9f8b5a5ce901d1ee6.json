Sales were helped by currency tailwinds, mainly from the dollar, the French company said.\n\nPernod backed its guidance of organic growth in profit from recurring operations of between 5% and 7% for fiscal 2020. It expects foreign exchange to have a \"significantly positive\" impact on this metric, it said.\n\nThe company said it will buy back its own shares for up to EUR150 million between Oct. 18 and Dec. 18 as part of the EUR1 billion buyback program it announced in August.\n\nWrite to Cristina Roca at cristina.roca@dowjones.com; @_cristinaroca\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 02:03 ET (06:03 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
