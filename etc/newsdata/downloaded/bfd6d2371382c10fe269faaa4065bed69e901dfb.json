(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nFormer national-security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s lawyer claims in a new bombshell court filing that the FBI tampered with notes from his 2017 interview, during which Flynn pleaded guilty to lying.\n\nIn a 37-page motion, attorney Sidney Powell called on the court to \u201cdismiss the entire prosecution for outrageous government misconduct\u201d over allegations that FBI agents manipulated a form summarizing Flynn\u2019s statements to investigators.\n\nThe interview dealt with Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to charges that he lied to the FBI about his Russia contacts during his brief stint as national-security adviser. He is expected to be sentenced in December.\n\n\u201cThose changes added an unequivocal statement that \u2018Flynn stated he did not\u2019 \u2014 in response to whether Mr. Flynn had asked Kislyak to vote in a certain manner or slow down the UN vote [on sanctions],\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThis is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on the issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat question and answer does not appear in the notes, yet it was made into a criminal offense,\u201d Powell wrote in the motion. \u201cThe draft also shows that the agents moved a sentence to make it seem to be an answer to a question it was not.\u201d\n\nOne of the FBI agents involved in the interview was Peter Strzok, who was fired from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigative team when text messages disparaging President Trump were discovered between him and FBI colleague Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair.\n\nFBI brass sent Strzok and another agent to conduct an \u201cambush-interview\u201d of Flynn explicitly to trap him into making statements they could claim were false, Flynn\u2019s defense team alleged.\n\n\u201cThis amounts to conduct so shocking to the conscience and so inimical to our system of justice that it requires the dismissal of the charges for outrageous government conduct,\u201d Powell said.\n\nFlynn\u2019s defense team has also accused prosecutors of withholding classified information and other evidence favorable to Flynn.\n\n\u201cThe government continues to hide evidence of the original 302 [the interview notes], other exculpatory texts, and other forms of information completely,\u201d Powell wrote.", "description": "Former national-security adviser Michael Flynn's lawyer claims in a new bombshell court filing that the FBI tampered with notes from his 2017 interview.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Ilya Shapiro", "Kevin D.
