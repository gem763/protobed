The CJEU ruled that an Austrian court correctly ordered Facebook to take down statements about an Austrian politician, not just in Austria, not just in Europe, but everywhere in the world. Called an \u201coaf\u201d and a \u201cfascist,\u201d the politician more or less proved the truth of the accusations by suing to keep that and similar statements off Facebook worldwide. I suggest that the US adopt blocking legislation to protect the First Amendment from foreign government interference and argue that President Trump should support such a law. After all, if he were ever to insult a European politician on Twitter, this ruling could lead to litigation that takes his Twitter account off the air. Heading off that threat is truly a legislative and international agenda for the Age of Trump!", "description": "", "authors": ["Stewart Baker", "Reason.Com When-Will-The-European-Union-Order-Twitter-To-Silence-President-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
