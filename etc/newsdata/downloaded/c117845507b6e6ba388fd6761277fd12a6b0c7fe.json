It\u2019s easy to look ahead, but the guys did a great job of staying in the moment and going out and winning today\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nJosh Donaldson doubled and drove in three runs, Mike Foltynewicz pitched five scoreless innings, and the streaking Braves won their sixth straight game with a 7-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.\n\nOzzie Albies added an early RBI for the Braves, who are 14-2 since Aug. 16 and 32 games over .500 for the first time since the 2003 team finished 101-61.\n\nTyler Flowers\u2019 three-run double in the eighth finished off the Blue Jays, who have lost 12 of 15 to fall a season-worst 30 games under .500.\n\nAtlanta heads into its off day with a 10-game home winning streak and a 6\u00bd-game lead over the Nationals.\n\nFoltynewicz (5-5) allowed a baserunner in each of his innings, but none in scoring position. His last threat came from Randal Grichuk, who singled to begin the fifth and was erased on the last of three double plays.\n\nThe Braves led 2-0 in the first off Wilmer Font (3-4). Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., mired in a .162 slump since Aug. 13, tripled off the brick wall in right and scored on Albies\u2019 single. Albies advanced on Freddie Freeman\u2019s opposite-field double down the third base line and scored when Donaldson lined a single to left.\n\nDonaldson lined a double to left in the fifth off T.J. Zeuch, scoring Acu\u00f1a and Freeman to make it 4-0. Donaldson is 6 for his last 15 with six RBIs over his last three games.\n\nBryse Wilson, the second Atlanta pitcher, gave up Rowdy Tellez\u2019s second homer in the last two nights and Derek Fisher\u2019s RBI double to make it 4-2 in the seventh.\n\nFoltynewicz, who left the game after Snitker noticed his face was blush red in the dugout, walked three and struck out two. Atlanta has won his last nine starts, though the right-hander has a 5.27 ERA over that span.\n\n\u201cHe looks fine now,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cThey brought him in to see how he\u2019s doing, but at that point and time he didn\u2019t look so hot.\u201d\n\nFoltynewicz said he felt better after getting checked out by the team medical staff.\n\n\u201cMy body was very warm today, even when I started in the \u2018pen and was coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the first three innings, it was just a very uncomfortable feeling for me out there.\u201d\n\nFont, getting a spot start for the Blue Jays, gave up two runs and four hits in one inning.\n\nIn the eighth, two Toronto pitchers walked the bases loaded before Flowers\u2019 liner bounced off Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s glove in center field to put the game out of reach.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a play we should\u2019ve made in center field, and we didn\u2019t make it after the walks,\u201d Toronto manager Charlie Montoya said. \u201cThen that was the game.\u201d\n\nROSTER MOVES\n\nToronto selected the contract of Zeuch, a 2016 first-round draft pick who allowed two runs and three hits in his major league debut. Zeuch, who pitched a no-hitter two weeks ago for Triple-A Buffalo, became the 37th pitcher used by the Blue Jays this year, a new franchise high. \u2026 OF Anthony Alford, OF Jonathan Davis and INF Richard Ure\u00f1a were recalled from Buffalo. \u2026 RHP Zack Godley was designated for assignment. \u2026 Atlanta recalled Wilson and LHP A.J. Minter from Triple-A Gwinnett.\n\nROLLING\n\nThe 10th straight victory at SunTrust Park gave the Braves their longest home winning streak since the 2000 team won 12 in a row. \u2026 Donaldson became the 13th player in franchise history with 30 doubles and 30 homers.\n\nTHAT HURTS\n\nToronto hasn\u2019t been this many games under .500 since 1995.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jays: Toronto is off Wednesday and begins a four-game series Thursday at Tampa Bay. The Blue Jays have yet to announce a starter.\n\nBraves: LHP Max Fried (15-4, 4.09 ERA) will make his 27h start of the season on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Braves manager Brian Snitker plans to relax Wednesday and enjoy a rare off day in the middle of a pennant race.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/blue_jays_braves_baseball_79913_c0-89-2121-1325_s1770x1032.jpg?a95813b27b23090ccc73bfed6bad65f1c500cf6c"}
