Tulsi Gabbard over Clinton\u2019s insinuation that Gabbard was fronting for the Russians in her long-shot presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, if you\u2019ve heard of her, she\u2019s the one that\u2019s accusing everybody of being a Russian agent,\u201d said Trump during a Monday Cabinet meeting at the White House. \u201cAnybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent, so that\u2019s a scam that was pretty much put down. Tulsi, I don\u2019t know Tulsi but she\u2019s not a Russian agent.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on the podcast of former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe published last week, Clinton expressed her concerns about possible Russian interference in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also going to do third-party again,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton didn\u2019t mention Gabbard by name, no other female candidates currently running in the primary \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar and spiritualist author Marianne Williamson \u2014 have been accused of having ties to Russia. Gabbard has been criticized for some of her foreign policy stances, including visiting Syrian President Bashar Assad, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFew things rile up Trump as much as the question of Russian interference in American elections, which he treats as impugning his victory in 2016. While Trump has insisted that Russia had nothing to do with the 2016 election, siding with Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies, both special counsel Robert Mueller and the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee found that Russia directly interfered in an attempt to aid Trump.\n\nTrump also defended Jill Stein, the 2016 Green Party candidate who Clinton also said was \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d\n\nStein, whose vote totals in key Midwestern swing states were larger than Trump\u2019s margin over Clinton, has been blamed by Democrats as a reason for her loss to Trump. Stein was a guest at a 2015 dinner in Moscow honoring the Russian propaganda outlet RT, which Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, also attended, both seated at the head table with Putin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Jill Stein,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI know she likes environment. I don\u2019t think she likes Russians. If she does like them I know she\u2019s not an asset. [Clinton] called her an asset of Russia. These people are sick. There\u2019s something wrong with that.\u201d\n\nTrump added that if Clinton \u201cwould have done this earlier, people would have realized what a scam it is. Everybody\u2019s a Russian, a Russian agent or a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump; Hillary Clinton; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Thank you @HillaryClinton,\u201d said Gabbard in a series of tweets. \u201cYou, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\u201d\n\nTrump had previously supported Gabbard in a tweet over the weekend, writing, \u201cSo now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard \u2018a Russian favorite,\u2019 and Jill Stein \u2018a Russian asset.\u2019 As you may have heard, I was called a big Russia lover also (actually, I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary\u2019s gone Crazy!\u201d", "description": "President Trump on Monday stepped gleefully into a name-calling dispute between Hillary Clinton and Rep.
