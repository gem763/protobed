Got a question for Polly? Email askpolly@nymag.com. Photo: Chaithanya Krishna Photography/Getty Images\n\nDear Polly,\n\nI am 38 years old and all the usual stuff \u2014 fairly attractive, great friends, fulfilling career, etc. From 22 to 34, I lived with a boyfriend who refused to marry me or think about having children, which was why we eventually broke up. Following this, I had a few years of not meeting anyone I really clicked with.\n\nLast summer, I met a lovely man through friends. He is four years younger than me, very kind and funny, and seems committed to a relationship with me. We are very happy and moved in together after five months, which has been lovely. From the beginning, we have both talked about this being a different and special relationship, built on radical honesty and empathy for each other as sensitive souls who have had previous bad experiences. He told me early on that he had chosen his future children\u2019s names, and we often talked about the child we would have together \u201cone day.\u201d\n\nIn the last couple of months, I turned 38 and one of my close friends had a baby. I have felt suddenly, frantically, and viscerally desperate for a child. The idea of never having one fills me with sadness.\n\nI have spoken to my boyfriend about this and, to be honest, fully expected us to come up with a plan together for having children in the next couple of years. I hoped my ideal life was coming together. Instead, he has seemed panicked and defensive. He says he definitely doesn\u2019t want children right now and doesn\u2019t want to think about the future. He says he\u2019s sorry if he\u2019s misled me, but if I want to have children in the immediate future, I should break up with him and find someone else. It\u2019s this last bit that I\u2019ve actually found the worst to deal with \u2014 this has made me feel very disposable (a familiar feeling).\n\nI don\u2019t want to be with anyone else, so I\u2019m simultaneously trying my best to enjoy what I do have but also hoping that somehow things will magically fall into place.\n\nEthically, I don\u2019t think I want to bring a child into the world who is solely dependent on me as an already older mother, so if I considered solo parenting, it would be through adoption. So I guess giving birth to my own baby, which I have always craved, is looking unlikely for me now and I should come to terms with it.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m concerned about being in a relationship where I\u2019m the one doing all the compromising, which I promised myself I would never do again. I am in therapy and have been working on my inability to address my own needs.\n\nDo you have any advice, please?\n\nCan\u2019t Believe I\u2019m Nearly Forty and This Is My Life\n\nDear CBINFATIML,\n\nYes, I have some advice. Break up with him.\n\nStaying with someone when that person doesn\u2019t want kids and you do is very difficult. It\u2019s particularly difficult when your partner says things like, \u201cWait a little bit longer and maybe I\u2019ll get to a place where I can start to imagine having kids with you,\u201d or \u201cI just need to get established in my career and then we can talk about it.\u201d I know a lot of women who waited for their partners to be ready for kids and ended up regretting it. One woman I know waited for years only to discover that her husband didn\u2019t want kids after all. Another friend waited for eight years and then her husband dumped her for a younger woman and had a kid with her instead. A different friend waited for years and then she needed fertility treatments, but she and her husband couldn\u2019t afford them, so they gave up.\n\nI try not to traffic in emotional horror stories, but the truth is that you don\u2019t know how common this experience is until you\u2019re in your 40s. It\u2019s common. And it is very, very hard for the women involved to feel like they missed their chance to have kids because someone convinced them to wait.\n\nYou\u2019re in a better position than they were, because your boyfriend isn\u2019t telling you to wait for him. He\u2019s telling you to break up with him. And when someone says the words, \u201cYou should probably break up with me,\u201d what they mean, nine times out of ten, is \u201cI\u2019m not sure about us, and even if you don\u2019t dump me right now, I\u2019ll probably dump you sooner or later.\u201d When someone gets defensive and panicked, when someone says they don\u2019t want to think about the future, when someone says they definitely don\u2019t want kids now even though they understand that you can pretty much only have kids now if you want to avoid costly fertility treatments, what they mean is, \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to dump me.\u201d\n\nNo one wants to leave a good relationship. But you need to hear the words coming out of his mouth. That\u2019s something I always had trouble with myself, back when I was dating a string of noncommittal men who didn\u2019t like thinking about the future. I had trouble listening and comprehending. I had trouble hearing \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d and \u201cI might never be sure\u201d and \u201cWhy do we have to talk about this right now?\u201d and \u201cMaybe you should just break up with me.\u201d I had trouble hearing \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel sometimes\u201d and \u201cI want to be ready, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nAnd even when my friends asked me, \u201cDo you hear what he\u2019s saying? He\u2019s saying he\u2019s not ready and he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be ready.\u201d I would still say, \u201cYeah, but this is a good relationship. He just drags his feet about everything.\u201d I would disagree with all outside opinions, even when they supported their arguments with the actual words coming out of my foot-dragging boyfriend\u2019s mouth.\n\nAnd then I would say, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I really don\u2019t get it.\u201d I was like a lost person who doesn\u2019t know what to do, so she lights her map on fire.\n\nYour boyfriend might love you very much. But he doesn\u2019t love you enough for your purposes at this moment in your life. You need someone to love you more than this. You deserve that. This experience doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re unlovable, either. Know that. Some people fear the future more than they value love in the present.\n\nDoes your boyfriend take initiative in other areas of his life, or does he avoid making big life choices? Can you see him staying with you indefinitely, never breaking up with you, but never really committing to anything, either? Does he talk about things he wants badly, or does he seem to only want things when they\u2019re imaginary? Is he a tiny bit depressed?\n\nI\u2019ve known a lot of men who struggle with forward motion. When I\u2019ve dated these men, friends have told me, \u201cGuys like that never really change.\u201d And you know what? They really don\u2019t. The same guys I knew who didn\u2019t know what they wanted at age 34 still don\u2019t know what they want at age 49 or 50. If they knew they wanted kids at 34 but they just weren\u2019t ready yet, they spent their 40s talking about how they wanted kids but they just hadn\u2019t found the right woman yet. If they found someone who seemed right, they inevitably broke up with that person, because it turned out she wasn\u2019t quite right. And that was too bad, because they really did want to have kids. They liked imagining kids a lot.\n\nSome people just can\u2019t make the leap. They might enjoy musing about the future, but they can\u2019t stand the idea that the present will change dramatically. They want to live exactly how they want, and they don\u2019t want to compromise. They\u2019re worried that they\u2019ll have to give something up. They\u2019re already nostalgic for five seconds ago. They fear change at a deep level.\n\nWhat\u2019s messed up is people like that often find a way to date people like you, people who can make decisions, who do want things, who aren\u2019t afraid of change, but who DON\u2019T KNOW HOW TO STAND THEIR GROUND YET.\n\nSo. You need to find some way to stand up for your future right now. I know it\u2019s difficult. But it\u2019s true for all of us. We all need to find the strength and the guts and the will to fight for our futures, if we want to be happy. We need to dare to want things, and we need to dare to say what we want out loud.\n\nYou say that your boyfriend \u201cseems committed\u201d to you. You two probably should have had a very concrete conversation about your plans for the future before you moved in together. You don\u2019t like to push things, I can see that. But you need to learn how to speak up and ask questions. You need to understand that you deserve to gather information. You don\u2019t have to just go with the flow. You have a right to ask for more.\n\nSo you don\u2019t just need to break up with this guy. You also need to figure out how to fight for your dreams. You need to believe in your dreams. You need to believe in them even after you break up with your boyfriend, and after he moves out. (Somehow I have a feeling he moved in with you, and not vice versa.) You need to believe in your dreams even when you\u2019re dating again and you hate it.\n\nI had my second kid at age 39 and I don\u2019t really feel like an older mother. You have to do what makes sense to you, but personally, I don\u2019t think you have some ethical obligation not to raise a kid alone past a certain age. Honestly, I think you\u2019re putting undue pressure on yourself with that belief and blocking your path to what you want for no reason. I wouldn\u2019t normally quibble with someone\u2019s beliefs on this front, but in your case, it sounds like that\u2019s a pattern with you. You look for reasons why you can\u2019t get what you want, why you don\u2019t deserve what you want, why you should settle for less.\n\nI get it. I was a settler, way back in the day. I settled for whatever was around. I saw this as virtuous. I felt like it was honorable to take less than I deserved. I thought it was cool, too, not to want too much. Big, unrealistic dreams were embarrassing. Wanting to be with someone who was really sexy and had an actual career and loved me like crazy was just absurd. What a shameful delusion! Don\u2019t tell anyone you want that! Don\u2019t say it out loud, you\u2019ll look like an idiot!\n\nThese days, I do whatever the fuck I like at all times. I do not mind looking like an idiot. I am not ashamed. I want to strongly recommend this lifestyle to you. This includes bailing on people when I\u2019m not in the mood (not if they\u2019re depressed or old or sick, obviously). This includes never pursuing work that sounds lackluster. This includes throwing exactly the sort of party I feel like throwing and inviting the exact people I feel like seeing. This includes writing whatever I feel like writing. This includes quitting work early for the day to read a book. This includes saying things like, \u201cI know we were going to cook, but let\u2019s go out tonight instead, what do you think?\u201d Small things and big things. I ask for what I want. I proceed according to my own compass.\n\nThe honest truth is that I can\u2019t describe to you just how dramatically the minute-to-minute experience of being alive changes after you learn how to do exactly what the fuck you want to do without imbuing every tiny choice with a heavy moral weight. I don\u2019t know how to paint a vivid enough picture for you of the cell-level shifts in your sensations, once you learn how to stand up for yourself, once you learn how not to do ALL OF THE COMPROMISING anymore, once you can say to yourself, \u201cI am not going to settle for less than I deserve\u201d \u2014 and you know that you won\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing quite like trusting yourself to honor what\u2019s best for you. It\u2019s much more relaxing than that uncertain state you\u2019re always in when you don\u2019t trust your own words and you don\u2019t stick to your own commitments.\n\nPart of the joy of living this way comes from knowing that you\u2019ll have your own back. It makes everything possible, and it makes anything possible.\n\nFor example, I keep thinking I should take a week off from work just to write songs. I haven\u2019t written a song in a few years, but I woke up yesterday and I thought, It\u2019s time to write songs again. This is the kind of thing you do when you care about yourself and you don\u2019t give a fuck what anyone else thinks about what you do. You don\u2019t feel overwhelmed as often, because you don\u2019t constantly second-guess yourself. You simply make time for what you love. You find a way to honor your needs.\n\nSo yes. Dump your boyfriend, who is perfectly wonderful and lovely but who is really, truly not ready for kids and who should love you much more, honestly. He doesn\u2019t sound very committed to you, kids or no kids. He\u2019s not solid enough to warrant your devotion. And then, once he\u2019s gone, I want you to work on loving yourself a lot more than you do right now. I want you to crawl out from under this faintly depressed, afraid, confused, compromised place you\u2019ve been living in, and I want you to start asking for more. I want you to WANT more.\n\nYou can have the life you want. I want you to believe that for a change.\n\nI have a friend who\u2019s raising a baby alone right now. She\u2019s often overwhelmed and she\u2019s often overworked and she\u2019s also filled with joy every single day. You need to widen your vision of what\u2019s possible. You need to stop regretting lost time. It\u2019s time to seize the future and grab it around the neck and wrestle it to the ground. You need to aim high for a change. You need to let your imagination lead you toward a life that\u2019s much bigger than anything you\u2019ve imagined before.\n\nI know that sounds grandiose. Sometimes when I\u2019m writing this column, I sound like someone I never thought I\u2019d become. But it\u2019s strange how good it can feel to find myself on unfamiliar ground, and instead of feeling afraid or unnerved, I just feel grateful.\n\nI know that this moment is incredibly difficult for you. But it\u2019s time to take a leap. Stop worrying so much about what you do and don\u2019t deserve and follow your heart. You aren\u2019t too old to start. You are very, very young. Stop measuring your life against someone else\u2019s imaginary timeline and START LIVING.\n\nThere is more love in this world for you. Believe that. Your future is wide open. Don\u2019t be afraid. Learn to cultivate faith in the future. Learn to cultivate faith in yourself.\n\nPolly\n\nPolly\u2019s evil twin Molly has a newsletter; sign up here.
