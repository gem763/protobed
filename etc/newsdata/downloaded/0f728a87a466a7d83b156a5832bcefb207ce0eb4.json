Not so much.\n\nUllenka Kash, an Instagram influencer who promotes her raw vegan diet and recipes online, is generating a fair bit of controversy over her idea for \u201clettucetti,\u201d which she uses as a replacement for traditional pasta in dishes such as her signature lettucetti \u201cBolognezze.\u201d\n\nSEE IT: DISNEY WORLD GUESTS CLAIM THEY WERE FED BUG-COVERED LETTUCE\n\nKash had originally shared an earlier video of the raw vegan \u201cBolognezze\u201d recipe back in July \u2014 seemingly before coming up with the term \u201clettucetti\u201d \u2014 but the idea didn\u2019t sit well with all of her 127,000 followers.\n\n\u201cImagine if I told you I was making pasta and I give you this,\u201d one Instagram user joked.\n\n\u201cLike... she could have at the VERY LEAST made zoodles and not used f---ing shredded lettuce,\u201d another wrote.\n\n\u201cYou just shredded lettuce. KFC do the same,\u201d someone pointed out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m into the vegan lifestyle, but that\u2019s just a f---ing salad,\u201d another observed. \u201cIt looks good, but that\u2019s a salad ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nOne other user, meanwhile, was fired up for perhaps the most hilarious reason of all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mad that she twirled it like pasta,\u201d commented an Instagram user who identifies as vegan.\n\nKash, however, said she never intends to mislead people, but rather to get them comfortable with the idea of swapping out higher-calorie, higher-fat ingredients for healthier ones.\n\n\u201cI am making a lot of raw vegan versions of popular foods, to make familiar what\u2019s unfamiliar,\u201d Ullenka told Metro U.K., adding that she developed the idea of \u201cBolognezze\u201d after growing tired of traditional salads, and only named it after Bolognese because it reminded her of the dish.\n\n\u201cTo follow high raw vegan lifestyle successfully, you\u2019ve got to get a bit creative, with your dinners especially,\u201d she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Kash \u2014 who also claims that a raw vegan diet helped to \u201cheal\u201d her daughters\u2019 eczema, and, more controversially, her son\u2019s autism, according to Vice \u2014 says she has no intentions of walking back her lettucetti and spaghetti comparisons, or responding to any lettucetti controversy, which she admits has gotten \u201cpretty hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept that some people will not agree with me and may continue to be upset,\" she told Metro. \"We are often afraid of something we don\u2019t know or don\u2019t understand.\"", "description": "\u201cImagine if I told you I was making pasta and I give you this,\u201d one Instagram user joked.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/LettucettiIstock2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
