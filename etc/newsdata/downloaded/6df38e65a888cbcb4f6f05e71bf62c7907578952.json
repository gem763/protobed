The decision reportedly further angered critics, who destroyed China-owned banking facilities and retail outlets across the city.", "description": "Gold Prices Dip Amid Lowered Rate Cut Expectations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1M0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
