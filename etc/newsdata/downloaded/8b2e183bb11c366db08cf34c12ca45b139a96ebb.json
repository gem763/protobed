USA TODAY\n\nPresident Donald Trump took another swipe at Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr regarding the latter's response to questions surrounding the ongoing situation involving the NBA and China.\n\n\"So funny to watch Steve Kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about China. He chocked (sic), and looks weak and pathetic. Don\u2019t want him at the White House!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe tweet was sent late Friday night following the president's rally in Louisiana, which at one point featured the Little League World Series champions taking the stage with Trump.\n\nThe back-and-forth of sorts between Kerr and the president began Wednesday when Trump, speaking at a news conference, said Kerr and San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich were \"pandering\" to China amid the ongoing saga between the country and the NBA that began with a pro-Hong Kong tweet sent by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey.\n\nSo funny to watch Steve Kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about China. He chocked, and looks weak and pathetic. Don\u2019t want him at the White House! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cI watched this guy Steve Kerr. He was like a little boy who was so scared to be answering the question,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t answer the question. He was shaking like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. Yet, he\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly. I watched Popovich do sort of the same thing. But he didn\u2019t look quite as scared, actually.\u201d\n\nKerr said Thursday that he was merely the latest \"shiny object\" for Trump, and that \"This is just another day. I was the shiny object yesterday. There was another one today, there will be a new one tomorrow. And the circus will go on. It's just strange, but it happened.\"\n\nMore: As impasse over pro-Hong Kong tweet simmers, what's at stake for the NBA in China?\n\nOpinion: Terrible week for NBA may open more eyes to price of doing business in China\n\nOpinion: Adam Silver shows NBA will only go so far in making nice with China\n\nFor context, here is what Kerr had said earlier in the week regarding his reasoning for largely declining to comment on the NBA-China situation, which drew Trump's initial criticisms: \"What I\u2019ve found is it\u2019s easy to speak on issues that I\u2019m passionate about and feel like I\u2019m well versed on. What I found is that it makes sense to stick to topics that fall in that category. I keep my comments to those. It\u2019s not difficult. I\u2019m more trying to learn.\u201d\n\nThe coach, entering his sixth season leading the Warriors, said he had emailed his brother-in-law \u2013 whom he said is a Chinese history professor \u2013 in hopes of learning more about the situation.\n\nSteve Kerr during a Team USA practice in August.
