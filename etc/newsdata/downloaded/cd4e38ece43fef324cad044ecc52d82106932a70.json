The initiative would fly 42,000 SpaceX satellites at a lower orbit of around 342 miles (550km)\n\nITU Chief of Space Services Alexandre Vallet confirmed that FCC had submitted 30,000 applications in 20 filings on SpaceX's behalf.\n\nSpaceX received FCC and ITU approval for a plan to launch 1,200 broadband satellites into orbit around Earth in May this year.\n\nBillionaire CEO of SpaceX Elon Musk says his 'starlink' plan is hoped to provide reliable internet worldwide.\n\nThe company already gained approval to launch the smaller constellation in November 2018 but it has since tweaked its plans.\n\nThey originally had permission to launch 4,425 Starlink satellites into orbit - between 689-823 miles (1,110 to 1,325 kilometres) above Earth.\n\nThe private aerospace firm was initially able to communicate with all of the 60 orbiting satellites they launched in May, pictured just prior to deployment, until three developed a fault\n\nHowever, they learned from test satellites that the lower orbit allows coverage with fewer satellites, reducing the amount of space debris.\n\nThe modified initiative would fly 42,000 SpaceX satellites at a lower orbit of around 342 miles (550km).\n\nSpaceX argued that it would be easier to get rid of satellites at this new lower altitude when they can no longer function properly in orbit - to avoid space junk accumulating.\n\nEach satellite weighs 227 kilograms and was assembled in SpaceX, Redmond, Seattle - 800 will need to be operational before Starlink becomes operational.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists calculate the number of satellites operational and orbiting the world at 2,062 (as of April).\n\nSpaceX's plans will mean 20 times that amount surrounding the globe - 8,500 satellites are believed to have been launched by all of humanity.\n\nA SpaceX spokesperson told Cnet: 'As demand escalates for fast, reliable internet around the world, especially for those where connectivity is non-existent, too expensive or unreliable, SpaceX is taking steps to responsibly scale Starlink's total network capacity and data density to meet the growth in users' anticipated needs.'\n\nApplications by SpaceX have been met with some resistance as fellow communications and satellite companies OneWeb and Kepler Communications refused their applications claiming the large number of satellites would interfere with their own.\n\nHowever the FCC ruled that it didn't believe the satellites would create 'significant' interference.\n\n'We deny the petitions to deny of OneWeb and Kepler. We note that there is no increase in the number of satellites in the constellation,' they said in the first ruling.\n\nWithin a day of being deployed, the train of Starlink satellites were seen to be far brighter in the night sky than had previously been anticipated\n\nSixty satellites from SpaceX have already been launched as part of the Starlink project - with three of them failing to orbit properly (which will eventually burn up) and two purposefully 'de-orbited' to see how they would incinerate on entering the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe astronomical community also share concerns over the launch of yet more 'bright' and 'noticeable' satellites in the skies they study.\n\nWHAT IS SPACE JUNK? Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. It is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit. The picture above shows a ball of twisted metal, thought to be fallen space junk, on a farm in Queensland, Australia, in 2008.\n\nA Dutch UFO website UFO Meldpunt Nederland encountered 150 reports of UFO's as people spotted the Starlinks orbiting over the Netherlands in a 'train of stars'.\n\nSpaceX has said they will make the next batch of satellites black so they are less noticeable.\n\nIn September Space X 'missed a message' telling them that one of the Starlink satellites was getting dangerously close to a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite.\n\nThe ESA moved their satellite above the Starlink to avoid a collision.\n\nA statement from SpaceX said they had encountered an error with their alert system, reoports Cnet.\n\nSpeaking of the risks of such mega-constellation launching operations, European Space Agency scientist Stijn Lemmens told Scientific American in May that 'the worst case is: You launch all your satellites, you go bankrupt, and they all stay there.'\n\n'Then you have thousands of new satellites without a plan of getting them out of there. And you would have a Kessler-type of syndrome.'\n\nThe Kessler syndrome is a hypothetical situation in which there is so much space junk in orbit that space operations might be rendered impossible for generations.", "description": "Billionaire CEO of SpaceX Elon Musk says his 'starlink' plan is hoped to provide reliable internet worldwide.
