LOUIS (AP) - Thatcher Demko is making the most of his time in the Vancouver Canucks\u2019 starting lineup.\n\nDemko made 34 saves in regulation and overtime and stopped all six shots in a shootout to help the Canucks to a 4-3 win over the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.\n\nVancouver won its fourth in a row - its longest streak since winning four straight from March 25-31, 2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we were able to get the win,\u201d Demko said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me really.\u201d\n\nJosh Leivo scored the lone shootout goal, which came at the end of the sixth round.\n\nBo Horvat, J.T. Miller and Micheal Ferland scored for the Canucks, who won for the first time on the road in three tries this season.\n\nVladimir Tarasenko, Alex Pietrangelo and Robby Fabbri scored for the defending Stanley Cup champions, who have dropped three straight.\n\nDemko is replacing regular starter Jacob Markstrom, who has missed the last two games due to a family emergency.\n\nThe San Diego-born Demko stopped 26 shots in a 5-1 win over Detroit on Tuesday in his first start of the season.\n\nHe made a pair of impressive stops in the shootout, including pad saves on Brayden Schenn and Alexander Steen.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a composed guy,\u201d Vancouver coach Travis Green said of Demko. \u201cHe\u2019s ultra-competitive. That\u2019s a hell of a hockey team over there and he had to make some tough saves.\u201d\n\nLeivo lifted a shot over Jordan Binnington after the first 11 shooters came up empty.\n\nHorvat jammed the puck in off a scramble in front of the net to tie the game at 3-3 with 7:55 left in the third period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s feeling good right now, guys are confident,\u201d Horvat said. \u201cBut at the same time, it should push us to win more.\u201d\n\nTarasenko and Pietrangelo scored 47 seconds apart in the second period to give the Blues a 3-1 lead.\n\nPietrangelo ripped a one-timer from the top of the faceoff circle off a pass from Oskar Sundqvist at 2:47. Tarasenko then jumped on the rebound of a shot from Jaden Schwartz for his second goal in as many games.\n\nFerland tied the game 1-1 on the rebound of shot by Brandon Sutter early in the second period. Miller cut the deficit to 3-2 with his third goal in two games.\n\nThe Blues have points in six of seven games this season, but have blown two-goal leads in all three extra time losses.\n\n\u201cWe can do a better job of closing teams out,\u201d Pietrangelo said. \u201cOnce we start closing out teams, we can be pushing things in the right direction.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Blues visited the White House on Tuesday. Since 2007, teams are 7-2-2 in their first game after visiting the White House. \u2026 Vancouver G Jakob Markstrom is not with the team because of a family emergency. He has missed the last two games. \u2026 St. Louis C Brayden Schenn had a five-game goal streak snapped. \u2026 Blues RW Robert Thomas returned to the lineup after missing the past five games with an upper-body injury that was not related to his left wrist injury that required offseason surgery. \u2026 St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright and catcher Yadier Molina were in attendance, two days after they were eliminated from the playoffs by the Washington Nationals.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanucks: Face New Jersey on Saturday in the second game of a four-game trip.\n\nBlues: Host Montreal on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thatcher Demko is making the most of his time in the Vancouver Canucks' starting lineup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Overbey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/canucks_blues_hockey_58061_c14-0-2486-1442_s1200x700.jpg?3b7b7fad497743253ab368f0e894b2ac533f45ab", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
