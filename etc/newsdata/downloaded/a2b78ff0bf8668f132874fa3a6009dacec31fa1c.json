A Texas jury in June found Huawei had stolen CNEX\u2019s solid-state drive computer technology but declined to award damages.\n\nThe charging document describes the company identifiable as Huawei as having \u201cattempted to misappropriate\u201d technology from a company identifiable as CNEX since 2016, and it says Mr. Mao worked with the company \u201cas part of this fraudulent scheme.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Mao, who was charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud, declined to comment. Mr. Mao, who worked at universities in both Texas and China, pleaded not guilty on Aug. 28 and has been released on bail.\n\nFor more than a decade, Huawei has faced a number of allegations in civil suits about intellectual-property theft. But the Justice Department\u2019s CNEX case underscores its aggressive approach to Huawei and its alleged IP theft on a number of fronts, including criminal cases accusing the company of stealing from T-Mobile US Inc., and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nRelated Video Allies are under U.S. pressure to shun Huawei. But the company's prevalence in existing telecom networks and dominance in 5G technology make that nearly impossible. Illustration: Crystal Tai\n\nIn the new case, the Justice Department is drawing particular attention to Huawei\u2019s alleged use of university professors it funds to get access to cutting-edge tech. The charges say the U.S. unit of the company identifiable as Huawei donated $100,000 to a Texas university Mr. Mao later worked at to support related research, and it portrayed Mr. Mao as trying to use the framework of academic research to secretly further Huawei\u2019s technology.\n\nIn a statement, Huawei didn\u2019t dispute that it was the Chinese \u201ctelecommunications conglomerate\u201d referred to as \u201cCompany 1\u201d in the Aug. 14 federal charges.\n\nBut it denied wrongdoing, adding: \u201cHuawei strongly disagrees that it or any of its employees were involved in any efforts to take CNEX trade secrets through a Chinese University or otherwise. Whatever arrangement CNEX may have entered into with a Chinese research institution is between CNEX and that institution\u2014and does not involve Huawei, and Huawei is not aware of any wrong doing of the University or its employees.\u201d\n\nMr. Mao was an associate professor at Xiamen University in Fujian, China, and also worked in the computer-science department at the University of Texas-Arlington since 2018, according to the university\u2019s website. In December 2016, he contacted the \u201cVictim Company\u201d to obtain a computer board that would enable him to test the firm\u2019s unique solid-state drive, or SSD, storage technology, according to the complaint. The technology allows massive data centers to manage the ever-growing volume of information generated by artificial intelligence and other advanced applications.\n\nA spokesman for UT-Arlington said he couldn\u2019t comment because of the \u201congoing federal investigation.\u201d A representative of Xiamen University didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Mao represented to CNEX that he wanted the board\u2014which wasn\u2019t available to the public for purchase and which contained proprietary technology\u2014for academic research, according to the complaint. CNEX agreed to send him the board after he signed a nondisclosure agreement pledging not to share the technology with third parties or to use it to develop a competitive product, the complaint said.\n\nBut, unbeknownst to CNEX, Mr. Mao was also working with Huawei\u2019s SSD Application Department Manager to develop a similar product, the complaint said, referring to the executive as \u201cco-conspirator 1.\u201d The complaint cites specific testimony the executive gave during the CNEX trial, which matches that of Hou Jiancen, of Huawei\u2019s chip-development unit, at the civil trial.\n\nMr. Hou couldn\u2019t be reached for comment; Huawei declined to comment on his behalf.\n\nMr. Mao also discussed his research on CNEX\u2019s board with a professor at a Texas university whose supervision he worked under, and who worked on a study titled \u201cEnforcing Xth Percentile Latency and Throughput SLOs under Consolidated Datacenter Resources,\u201d the complaint said, identifying this person only as \u201cProfessor 1.\u201d\n\nMr. Mao worked with UT-Arlington computer science professor Hong Jiang, according to the university website, which lists the same project as one of his current research projects, funded by Huawei\u2019s U.S. unit, Futurewei. The professor didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe case against Mr. Mao raises the possibility of further federal action targeting Huawei itself and its executives.\n\nIn the civil case in Texas, CNEX alleged Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu participated in a conspiracy to steal its technology with the help of Mr. Mao and others. Huawei acknowledged in that case that Mr. Xu \u201cwas in the chain of command that had requested\u201d information about CNEX, and the fact that there had been an agreement between Huawei and Xiamen University, but it denied wrongdoing.\n\nSince Mr. Mao\u2019s Aug. 14 arrest and subsequent court appearances in Fort Worth, Texas, the case has been transferred to federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., where it has been assigned to the same prosecutor and federal judge handling the case against Huawei deputy chairwoman Meng Wanzhou for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Legal experts said that move suggests there are links between the cases against Mr. Mao and Ms. Meng, which lists additional, unnamed defendants.\n\nAccording to the complaint against Mr. Mao, within weeks of his receiving the computer board, in May 2017, he told the company that one of his students had damaged it, the complaint said, with prosecutors concluding that someone had tried to hack it. The next month, a CNEX distributor alerted CNEX that purchasers for Huawei had contacted it directly to procure the same board and provided the product number, even though both the distributor\u2019s identity and that number were confidential, the complaint said. Mr. Mao was the only academic to whom the \u201cVictim Company\u201d had ever provided such information, the complaint said.\n\nIn July 2017, CNEX stopped providing Mr. Mao technical support for the board, but Mr. Mao continued to work on the project, possibly with the help of \u201cProfessor 1\u201d and a colleague, prosecutors alleged. The following month, Mr. Mao requested remote access to Professor 1\u2019s server in Texas and then began working at UT-Arlington himself the following year, according to the complaint.\n\nU.S. companies for years have complained that Huawei has pilfered their technology, which Huawei has denied. Prosecutors earlier this year accused Huawei of stealing information from T-Mobile US about a phone-testing robot, \u201cTappy,\u201d after a Seattle jury found Huawei civilly liable for misappropriating the technology.\n\nLast week, Huawei in a news release accused the U.S. government of \u201cusing every tool at its disposal\u201d to disrupt its business, and it condemned a Portuguese multimedia producer after The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. prosecutors were investigating his allegations Huawei stole his IP as well.\n\nWrite to Kate O\u2019Keeffe at kathryn.okeeffe@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. has filed criminal charges against a Chinese professor in Texas accused of stealing a U.S. startup\u2019s technology for Huawei Technologies, escalating the U.S.\u2019s investigations into issues related to the telecom giant.", "authors": ["Kate O Keeffe", "Aruna Viswanatha", "Kathryn.Okeeffe Wsj.Com", "Aruna.Viswanatha Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103406/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
