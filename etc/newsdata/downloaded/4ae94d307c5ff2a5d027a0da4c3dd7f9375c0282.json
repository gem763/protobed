He thinks he has got the body of a 23-year-old.\"\n\nIn one incredibly cheeky snap, the Italian born dancer can be seen waltzing around in minuscule pants.\n\nThe chatty choreographer fondly gripped hold of his dear female friend Kelly Hoppen's hand as they posed for a fun picture.\n\nBruno often shares underwear-clad snaps with his 210K followers on social media.\n\nBruno missed out on judging in Strictly last week and was replaced by Alfonso Ribeiro as he was busy filming in America on Dancing With The Stars.\n\nThe judge returned for Halloween week, which saw Catherine Tyldesly shockingly eliminated from the show.\n\nHarsh-talking judge Craig recently made headlines after he hit back at the public outcry following Catherine's controversial exit from the BBC dance competition.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Online at the recent Pride Of Britain Awards 2019, the judge bragged he was happy with the result despite the public anger.\n\nThe Strictly star called the public out for not filing their votes.\n\n(Image: Roland Leon Sunday Mirror)\n\nHe said: \"Yeah I was [happy with the result]. The public weren't. I just say vote, you must vote. The public have 50% of the vote, not just four of us.\"\n\nCraig's swipe back at the public come after head judge Shirley Ballas received death threats from online trolls following Dev Griffin's Strictly departure.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues this Saturday.", "description": "Craig Revel Horwood has begged fellow Strictly judge Bruno Tonioli to stop flashing his pants on social media.", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Copyright Unknown", "Sopa Images Lightrocket Via Gett", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761733.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-151605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
