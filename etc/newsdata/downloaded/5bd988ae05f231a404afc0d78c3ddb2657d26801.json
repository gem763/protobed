CNBC reported that a Chinese delegation, helmed by Vice Premier Liu He, would arrive in the U.S. capital in Oct. 10-11 for higher-level talks.\n\nU.S. equity markets ended lower on Friday, with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.53% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.26% posting weekly losses.\n\nHere\u2019s what investors should keep in mind if a broader crackdown on U.S. capital flows into China makes further headway:\n\nExchanges\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese companies have already been under pressure over complaints that the rigor of financial statements from Chinese companies were not at the same standard of U.S. firms, exposing American investors to potential corporate governance problems and outright fraud.\n\nTwo bipartisan bills have been introduced in Congress aimed at pushing U.S.-listed Chinese firms to comply with auditing rules in the U.S. and if those companies failed to submit to regulatory oversight, they would face delisting.\n\nBeijing has long pushed back on moves to allow overseas regulators to examine the audit work of domestic accounting firms.\n\nChinese companies have a large presence in U.S. capital markets. A total of 156 Chinese companies were listed in the U.S., commanding a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion, as of February 2019.\n\nSee: Regulators revive China audit dispute, but miss prime opportunity to fully explain why\n\nChinese internet giants listed in the U.S. were hit hard by Friday\u2019s report. Alibaba\u2019s BABA, -5.15% stock closed down around 5.2%, and Baidu\u2019s BIDU, -3.67% shares ended lower by 3.7% in Friday trading.\n\nThe KraneShares CSI China Internet Exchange-traded fund KWEB, -3.80% fell 3.8%, while the broader iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI, -2.18% finished down 2.2%, FactSet data shows.\n\nRead: Huya, iQiyi, Nio, Luckin Coffee, Baidu and Pinduoduo move sharply lower on listing report\n\nDecoupling\n\nThe breakout of trade tensions between U.S. and China about two years ago has led some in Washington to push for a broader decoupling of financial ties between the two countries, drawing Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. into the cross-sights of more hawkish members of Congress.\n\nAnalysts say this pressure may have led some Chinese companies to look for other listing venues. Alibaba announced it would hold its second listing in Hong Kong. Those plans, however, were postponed after the Asian financial center was rocked by protests in the past few months.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio has been particularly vocal on the need to monitor connections between Wall Street and China.\n\nIn a June letter, Rubio asked MSCI, the global securities index provider, what they were doing to ensure that U.S. investors were not funneling money into Chinese state organs, or businesses linked to Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer allow China\u2019s authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets while Chinese companies avoid financial disclosure and basic transparency, and place US investors and pensioners at risk,\u201d Rubio told MSCI\u2019s chairman and chief executive Henry Fernandez in a letter dated June 12.\n\nLater in August, he called for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, a pension fund for federal government employees, to avoid benchmarking its funds to the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index.\n\nRubio said the index contained companies partly owned by Beijing like Hikvision 002415, -0.03%, which have been accused of being complicit in human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\n\nRubio has let the White House know what he is doing with regard to his efforts on China and U.S. capital markets, a spokesman for the senator told MarketWatch. But the senator didn\u2019t coordinate on the actions reported by Bloomberg, the spokesman said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear, however, if the U.S. government can pressure global index providers not to include shares from Chinese firms.\n\nCheck out: \u2018Socially responsible\u2019 investors may have unwittingly backed police-state surveillance in China\n\nBenchmarking\n\nPatrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management worried that if U.S. investors couldn\u2019t include Chinese stocks and bonds into their portfolios, they could risk underperforming their benchmarked indexes. That\u2019s become a pertinent issue as assets linked to Chinese companies now occupy a bigger weighting in global indexes, in line with China\u2019s growing economic and financial heft.\n\nThat has been a somewhat controversial development, and not all investors have been happy with it. But it means that if they can\u2019t allocate to Chinese assets, they\u2019re at risk of deviating from their expected performance. \u2014 Patrick Chovanec (@prchovanec) September 27, 2019\n\nIn May, MSCI quadrupled the weight of Chinese stocks listed in domestic bourses in the MSCI Emerging Markets EEM, -1.29% to 3.3%.\n\nBloomberg Barclays and JP Morgan have both recently added Chinese government bonds and debt issued by the country\u2019s policy banks to their indexes, even as the FTSE Russell declined to do so on Thursday.", "description": "Reports that the White House might look to limit U.S. portfolio inflows into Chinese companies is roiling Wall Street, as investors try to make sense of the...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS234_chinap_ZG_20190927131856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
