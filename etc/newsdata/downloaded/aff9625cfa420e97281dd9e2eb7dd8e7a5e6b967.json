He had been invited there the day before by Communitech\u2019s CEO Iain Klugman, who insisted over the phone\u2014with an urgency Woods thought was odd\u2014that they meet as soon as possible.\n\nNot five minutes into dinner, it became clear to Woods why he had been summoned. \u201c\u2018What are you going to do for us here?\u2019\u201d Woods recounts Klugman asking immediately after toasting his arrival to town, along with other local luminaries\u2014like then-University of Waterloo (UW) president David Johnston\u2014who proceeded to brief Woods on how the community worked. \u201c\u2018If you do it this way it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u2019\u201d Woods recalls them conveying to him. \u201cAnd they sort of left uncited what would happen if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWoods\u2019s arrival in town in August 2008 signalled, in many ways, Google\u2019s official stake in the region\u2019s tight-knit innovation ecosystem. Over the 10-plus years prior, Kitchener-Waterloo had honed an identity as Canada\u2019s hub of digital talent and entrepreneurship. Now, Google\u2014a Silicon Valley behemoth with few apparent ties to the community\u2014risked upsetting that ecosystem. The leaders responsible for carefully fostering that community had reason to question how the company\u2019s presence would alter what had become Canada\u2019s most promising innovation hub.\n\nIn the 10 years since Woods arrived to spearhead Google\u2019s Canadian operations, the company\u2019s footprint in the region has ballooned from about 20 to 600 employees; its Waterloo office (Google Canada\u2019s engineering headquarters) now accounts for 60 per cent of its total workforce in the country. Its outsized presence amid the 500,000-plus population of Waterloo Region\u2014which encompasses Waterloo, Kitchener and Cambridge\u2014has not gone unnoticed. Google has become a reliable source of funding and mentorship for local startups. The company\u2019s employees have logged hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours in the community. And, it\u2019s been a vocal advocate on civic files like better transit and boosting STEM in the curriculum.\n\nKitchener\u2019s newly re-elected mayor, Berry Vrbanovic, notes that some of Google\u2019s impact is harder to measure\u2014like bolstering the city\u2019s reputation as an innovation hub. \u201cGoogle has really served as part of the foundation from which everything here has grown over the last number of years,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as you get a large company like that, it gives the broader ecosystem that signal of confidence that this is the place to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey draw talent to the region, which is good for me,\u201d says Alroy Almeida, CEO and co-founder of Volterra, a fast-growing tech startup in Waterloo, who notes that people originally drawn to the region by Google may be more likely to join a local company, like his, once they\u2019re in town.\n\nOthers, however, worry that by virtue of being a large, foreign technology company, Google\u2019s growth in the area could stunt local companies\u2014particularly those in the scaling phase, by outcompeting them for talent, driving up wages and cornering the digital tech market.\n\nIndeed, Google walks a tightrope in the community\u2014a delicate give-and-take with the ecosystem that\u2019s underscored by persistent tension. It\u2019s a balancing act that many foreign companies fumble, if they attempt it at all. \u201cThe Googles of the world, you can\u2019t block them out,\u201d says Carol Leaman, CEO of Waterloo-based Axonify, an online learning platform. \u201cBecause Google came in very slowly and carefully and logically, they\u2019ve been embraced here,\u201d she adds. \u201cRight from the beginning was \u2018How can we contribute back to the community?\u2019\u201d\n\nTalking Point Google\u2019s foray into Kitchener-Waterloo at first raised concern within the tight-knit tech ecosystem. Now, more than 10 years later, the Silicon Valley behemoth has stymied fears of rampant talent poaching and innovation hoarding by integrating into the community on KW\u2019s terms. The company\u2019s outsized presence in the community isn\u2019t without its critics, however, with some arguing that championing foreign multinationals represents a myopic approach to the economics of innovation.\n\nIn 2007, as Google neared its 10th anniversary, co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page decided they needed a new global expansion strategy. \u201cIf they were going to develop world-relevant products,\u201d says Woods, \u201cthey needed to develop them from the world; not from California.\u201d The company set out on a 22-month global tour to identify cities where it would put down roots. Each potential international headquarters needed a world-class technology university, a local culture of entrepreneurship, an appealing standard of living and a local leader who could represent the interests of both Google and the community.\n\nAlong with cities like Sydney, Z\u00fcrich and London, Google selected Waterloo, and named Woods\u2014who did his bachelor\u2019s degree and PhD at UW\u2014as the honorary local to head up the endeavor.\n\nWoods, originally from Saskatchewan, was reluctant to take the plum job. \u201cI had some bad experiences with my companies being acquired by big companies in the Valley,\u201d says Woods, who was building his startup NeoEdge Networks in Mountain View, Calif. when the Google offer came up. \u201cI had promised myself I would never go work for a large company ever again.\u201d\n\nGetting Woods on board meant convincing him that Google\u2014whose parent organization Alphabet is the fourth-largest enterprise in the world, with a market capitalization of roughly US$800 billion\u2014wasn\u2019t actually a large company. \u201cIt might be big on the balance sheet side or the stock value side, but it\u2019s not a big company organizationally at all,\u201d Woods insists. \u201cIt\u2019s a cross between a startup and organized chaos. It\u2019s constantly reinventing itself.\u201d\n\nPersuading Woods of Google\u2019s value to Kitchener-Waterloo was one thing; getting the community on-board was another question altogether. \u201cI think it was during that first two or three years that people were a little bit worried about the impact [Google] would have on Kitchener-Waterloo,\u201d says Leaman. \u201cThere was excitement mixed with a little bit of fear of \u2018How is this going to go?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn any given weekday afternoon, grade-school kids can be found downstairs at Google tinkering with robots. The echoey, 4,000 square-foot space of concrete floors, large windows and scattered desks is open to student groups and local STEM-related non-profits. Google officially opened the community area this past spring, at the same time announcing $2.1 million for outreach programs that teach STEM skills to school kids, women and immigrants.\n\nThe space was born out of a culture of volunteerism at Google, where employees are required to spend 10 per cent of their time giving back to the community. \u201cWe found that they needed space for all the things they were doing,\u201d says Woods. \u201cWe want to do more \u2018teach the teachers\u2019, we want to do more engagement with kids ourselves, but space is often a problem with schools. They have all this robotics equipment\u2014where do they put it? And so, we decided to create this community space downstairs to do these things.\u201d\n\nThat initiative is one way in which Google has integrated with the community. \u201cThey recognize that they have to contribute to the good of the whole,\u201d says Klugman. \u201cGoogle has grown in a fashion that says, \u2018We\u2019re playing the long game, and we\u2019re here to be part of this ecosystem.\u2019 If Google wanted to be 5,000 people in 10 years, they could have been,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut they would have wiped out the startups, and Steve Woods chose not to do that.\u201d\n\nThere were concerns in the beginning that Google could indeed pillage the community. When the company first entered Waterloo in 2005\u2014before Woods was at Google\u2014it did so by acquiring Reqwireless, a local mobile phone software development company. While Reqwireless employees enjoyed payouts and jobs with Google, the deal saw the startup wind-down before it had the chance to scale.\n\nAs Dan Ciuriak, economist and senior fellow at the Waterloo-based Centre for International Governance Innovation, noted in his July 2018 report on industrial policy for data-driven economies, \u201c[An] acquisition can dampen the dynamism of the host economy\u201d by blocking \u201cthe emergence of a future competitor.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there are ways beyond acquisition that foreign tech giants\u2014not just Google\u2014can stifle up-and-coming competition; a number of founders in Waterloo expressed concerns to The Logic around poaching talent and hoarding innovation, for instance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against them being here, but when we use incentives to get foreign companies to Canada, that\u2019s distorting the economy and it\u2019s creating inflation,\u201d says one executive from a scaling Waterloo-based technology company, referring to incentives like subsidized university tuition and Canada\u2019s Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive, which Google confirmed it leverages to help pay for R&D. \u201cIt\u2019s also, I would say, stunting growth of scaling companies because the cost of things like data scientists and developers goes up and could price them out of the market,\u201d says the executive, who asked not to be named out of concern it would cause harm to their company.\n\nSeveral Waterloo-based founders who spoke to The Logic\u2014few of whom felt comfortable speaking on the record\u2014complained about foreign companies\u2019 ability to leverage those taxpayer-funded incentive programs, only to have the return on that investment sent back to the company\u2019s country of origin through intellectual property.\n\nGoogle Inc. has 33 patent applications pending and 80 patents granted in the U.S. for inventions that were developed, at least in part, by employees in Kitchener-Waterloo (that doesn\u2019t include inventors who reside outside KW but work out of the Canadian headquarters). Jim Hinton, a Waterloo-based patent lawyer, says those figures likely capture about 70 per cent of patent activity that Google employees in the region have a hand in generating, and which is ultimately assigned to Google in Mountain View.\n\n\u201cOf course foreign branch plants make a contribution to our economy, but I would suggest Canada is capable of far bigger economic gains than simply being a hub for cheap talent,\u201d says Jim Balsillie, the former chairman and co-CEO of Research in Motion (RIM), who built and grew RIM out of Waterloo and turned it into one of the largest tech companies in the world.\n\nBalsillie argues that championing Google\u2019s presence in the region represents a myopic approach to the economics of innovation. \u201cThis is a matter of innovation economics, not shallow nationalism.\u201d\n\nAccording to Balsillie, the lack of large exits and IPOs in Waterloo recently indicates how challenging it is for local companies to scale. In the decade prior to Google\u2019s arrival, 10 companies from the Waterloo region went public, or were acquired, for more than $50 million. Those included RIM (now BlackBerry), OpenText and Sandvine. Since 2008, only one company, Arise Technologies, has gone public; it has since shut down.\n\n\u201cThe economic impact of those success stories is visible not just in KW but across Canada,\u201d Balsillie says. \u201cBut then came the incubator industrial complex and a push for cheap talent branch plants, and we haven\u2019t had an IPO in 12 years or even a decent exit. Why? Because global value chains in intangibles are inherently unstable, data asymmetry breaks markets and IP operates on a winner-take-all principle.\u201d\n\nOne can\u2019t attribute causation from the lack of IPOs alone. Those figures don\u2019t factor in the dot-com bust or the 2008\u201309 financial crisis, or the fact that more companies now choose to stay private longer because they can raise funds without an IPO\u2014but they\u2019re hard to ignore.\n\nShopify CEO Tobi L\u00fctke, who chairs the federal government\u2019s economic strategy table for digital industries, weighed in on the issue of foreign companies in Canada at the Elevate conference in Toronto last month. \u201cWhat we need is a couple of bigger [Canadian] tech companies, because [big companies] have a very outsized impact on the ecosystem,\u201d he told the audience. That same day, the government released an interim report on Canada\u2019s global competitiveness, which also flagged the problem. \u201cWe are exporting our most precious assets to the benefit of other countries,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. We do, however, need to double down on our own inventiveness to capture more of that wealth here at home.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Google has become a welcome presence in the Waterloo region. But that didn\u2019t happen by chance. Recall that first steakhouse meeting where Woods was grilled by the community\u2019s innovation leaders: \u201cFrom that moment on, I basically reported to David Johnston, as far as I could tell,\u201d says Woods. He and Johnston\u2014who was UW president from 1999 to 2010 and later Canada\u2019s Governor General\u2014would convene regularly at the University Club to set goals for Woods and ensure he was achieving them. \u201cHe had this notebook full of things I said I would do,\u201d Woods says\u2014things like increasing the number of Google Research Awards at the university, for example, and mentoring startups in the community and advocating for fast rail transit to Toronto and Pearson Airport. \u201cI would often postpone the meetings because I was terrified of going in there and not having them done,\u201d he says.\n\nOver time, those relationships became formalized. Woods eventually joined the board of Communitech and became an advisor to UW\u2019s ad hoc Committee on Technological Innovation. Soon, Google in Silicon Valley took note of the bond Woods had built with the community in Waterloo. \u201cThey picked up the model and it became Google for Entrepreneurs [G4E] worldwide,\u201d says Woods, with the company setting up its own Communitech-style innovation hubs in other cities. Initially, Google even had a G4E accelerator in Communitech, \u201cbut they decided it made more sense to support partner organizations like Communitech, rather than to run their own programming,\u201d says Chris Plunkett, vice-president of external relations at Communitech. G4E now sponsors Communitech\u2019s own accelerator programs, like Rev and Fierce Founders. A number of ventures that have gone through those programs, including Bridgit and Knowledgehook, have gone on to participate in the global G4E Demo Day in Mountain View.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been big supporters of our talent programming,\u201d says Plunkett. Most recently, Google started running themed one-day training sessions for other companies in the community, including one in June on analytics and search engine marketing.\n\nLeaman, whose company PostRank was acquired by Google in Silicon Valley in 2011, says Woods has been an effective ambassador for the region. \u201cGoogle in Kitchener-Waterloo has taken a very respectful approach to building their business here,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done that by, first and foremost, having a leader who has been very respectful of the community, who has gotten involved in the community and hasn\u2019t been just sort of this transplant who\u2019s come in with a mission to take from the community and not give back.\u201d\n\nSeveral Waterloo-based entrepreneurs who spoke to The Logic pointed to San Francisco-based Terminal as an example of how branch plants can upset the local ecosystem. Terminal\u2019s business model is to help companies (usually from the U.S.) outsource development to Canada, where they can access tax credits, talent and affordable wages. Terminal has offices in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Kitchener-Waterloo; it employs about 125 workers across Canada. \u201cThese Terminal companies have no interest in building a company in Canada or contributing to the local economy,\u201d says Leaman. \u201cIt just feels very different from what Google is doing. It feels like a satellite operation with all decisions getting made elsewhere. And giving government funding to those organizations is what I object to. I think that money could be redirected to real Canadian businesses.\u201d\n\nIn an email to The Logic, Terminal CEO Clay Kellogg said, \u201cWe invest in cities like Waterloo by building local offices, investing in established and emerging talent, and giving those engineers equity in scaling startups around the world,\u201d adding that Terminal may help keep talent in Canada who would otherwise have moved to places like Silicon Valley for work.\n\n\u201cIn the coming months and years, we know that major U.S. enterprises will be setting up shop in Canada or expanding\u2014Uber, Google, Amazon, Microsoft,\u201d said Kellogg. \u201cWhile we certainly hire local talent, Terminal isn\u2019t the threat. We simply compete with every other startup and enterprise tech company who\u2019s hiring.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to what degree, if at all, foreign companies in Canada ultimately benefit or leech off the local economies in which they operate. \u201cThis is a policy issue that\u2019s not going away,\u201d says the Waterloo-based executive, noting that policymakers need a way to assess the long-term economic impact of foreign companies compared to Canadian ones. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right data points for that, and that\u2019s really, really concerning.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Google in Waterloo has avoided the negative reputation assigned to big foreign companies in satellite cities, at least for now. It\u2019s done that by leveraging its clout as a big company to benefit, rather than traipse over, local ones.\n\n\u201cI tend to feel obligated in a way,\u201d says Woods. \u201cGoogle is big\u2014it\u2019s maybe not a structural monolith like some companies\u2014but it is big. We have a lot of resources. I spend a lot of my time trying to make sure we get more invested in the community.\u201d\n\nShare the full article! Send to a friend\n\nLoading... Thanks for sharing!

Of course, other companies would benefit, too. \u201cIf we can use Google\u2019s clout to bring in talent, that\u2019s great for us,\u201d says Almeida. \u201cIt builds a bigger city and a stronger community.\u201d", "description": "Google\u2019s Waterloo Region outpost has managed to stay in the community\u2019s good books\u2014a delicate balancing act that few foreign tech giants manage to achieve.", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre", "Murad Hemmadi", "Jessica Galang", "Zane Schwartz", "Megan Haynes"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/TLG004_GoogleKW.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-10-24"}
