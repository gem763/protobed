(GRMN), today announced a revolution in general aviation - the first Garmin Autoland system. In the event of an emergency, Autoland will control and land the aircraft without human intervention1. The Autoland system determines the most optimal airport and runway, taking into account factors such as weather, terrain, obstacles and aircraft performance statistics. Autoland brings peace of mind to air travel and will soon be available on select general aviation aircraft with the Garmin G3000\u00ae integrated flight deck.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191030005354/en/\n\n\u201cToday, aviation is forever changed as we introduce one of the industry\u2019s most significant innovations \u2013 the first Autoland system for general aviation aircraft,\u201d said Cliff Pemble, Garmin president and CEO. \u201cThe unveiling of Autoland demonstrates Garmin\u2019s deep commitment to develop advanced technologies that enhance aviation safety and save lives.\u201d\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the pilot or passengers on board the aircraft can activate Autoland to land the aircraft with a simple press of a dedicated button. Autoland can also activate automatically if the system determines it\u2019s necessary. Once activated, the system calculates a flight plan to the most suitable airport, initiates an approach to the runway and automatically lands the aircraft \u2013 without pilot or passenger intervention.\n\n\u201cThe vision and development of the world\u2019s first Autoland system for general aviation was a natural progression for Garmin as we looked at our aircraft systems and existing autonomous technologies and recognized it is our responsibility to use these building blocks to deliver a technology that will change lives and revolutionize air travel,\u201d said Phil Straub, Garmin executive vice president and managing director of aviation. \u201cCongratulations to the entire Garmin team for executing upon a tremendous vision that will transform the industry, forever change lives and help protect the most valuable contents in and around the aircraft \u2013 our children, family and friends.\u201d\n\nDuring an Autoland activation, the system takes into account a breadth of information and criteria. Factors taken into consideration when identifying the most suitable airport include weather, fuel on board, runway surface and length, terrain, obstacles and more. The availability of a GPS approach with lateral and vertical guidance to the runway is also required when the system is considering various airports and runways. Even further, the system will automatically communicate with air traffic control (ATC), advising controllers and pilots operating near the aircraft of its location and its intentions.\n\nThroughout an Autoland activation, the system provides simple visual and verbal communications in plain-language so passengers in the aircraft know what to expect. The flight displays show the aircraft\u2019s location on a map alongside information such as the destination airport, estimated time of arrival, distance to the destination airport and fuel remaining. Airspeed, altitude and aircraft heading are also labeled in an easy-to-understand format. Passengers also have the option to communicate with ATC by following instructions on the display using the touchscreen interface on the flight deck.\n\nThe Garmin Autothrottle system is used to automatically manage aircraft speed, engine performance and engine power so the aircraft can climb, descend or maintain altitude as needed during an Autoland activation. On approach to land, the system initiates a controlled descent to the airport. If the aircraft needs additional time to descend or slow down during the approach, the Autoland system initiates a standard holding procedure and extends the landing gear and flaps. Once in landing configuration, the aircraft begins its descent to the runway. On the runway, automatic braking is applied while tracking the runway centerline to bring the aircraft to a full stop. Engine shutdown is also automated so occupants can safely exit the aircraft.\n\nAt any time, a pilot can easily deactivate an Autoland activation. With a single press of the \u201cAP\u201d autopilot key on the autopilot controller or the autopilot disconnect button on the controls, an Autoland activation can be canceled. The flight display shows a message that confirms Autoland has been deactivated and in the event of an accidental deactivation, the system shows passengers how to reactivate Autoland if needed.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Garmin International, Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd.
