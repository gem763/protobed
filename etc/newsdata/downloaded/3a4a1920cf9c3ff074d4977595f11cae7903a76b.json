The coat and heels are a classic wardrobe essential for Melania Trump, who generally sticks to a uniform of beautifully crafted coats and stilettos for the winter season.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions, like when Mrs. Trump visited Wyoming this past week and wore casual Ralph Lauren-inspired activewear ensembles with sweaters, J Brand skinny jeans, and puffer coats.\n\nThe photos of Mrs. Trump\u2019s Wyoming visit are easily some of the most breathtaking portraits she has ever posed for, looking as though they were ripped from the pages of Vogue for a Bruce Weber fashion spread.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
