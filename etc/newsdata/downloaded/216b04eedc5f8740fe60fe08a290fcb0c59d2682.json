If anyone was gone too soon, it was Khal.\n\nBut the leader of the Dothraki became one of the most prolific figures through eight season on Game of Thrones, not because he was bursting with character, but because Momoa embodied everything fans could have asked for \u2013 which wasn\u2019t a coincidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShowrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss recalled casting the star, which was proving almost impossible until fans had their say.\n\n\u2018It was really hard to find a good Khal Drogo,\u2019 Benioff told the crowds at the Austin Film Festival on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u2018We had all these auditions and no one was quite right. And then we\u2019re looking at some website that had \u201cFan Casting of Game of Thrones.\u201d\n\n\u2018A lot of it was kinda knuckleheaded, but some of it was really smart. And there was one person, or maybe a few people, who said, \u201cOh, it should be this guy Jason Momoa.\u201d\n\nKhal Drogo was killed off Game of Thrones back in season 1 (Picture: HBO)\n\n\u2018And we\u2019d never heard of Jason before \u2014 and I apologise to the Baywatch fans \u2014 but I haven\u2019t gotten around to it. But I saw a picture of him, we both did, and I thought, \u201cWell, that really does look like Khal Drogo.\u201d\n\nGame of Thrones would go on to make Momoa a household name, later leading his own superhero franchise in Aquaman and taking charge in Apple TV\u2019s first big blockbuster, SEE \u2013 which cost a casual $15 million an episode so expect a spectacle. But, as Momoa has stressed time and time again \u2013 don\u2019t compare to Game of Thrones.\n\nGame of Thrones is available to stream on NOW TV. SEE launches this Friday on Apple TV+.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
