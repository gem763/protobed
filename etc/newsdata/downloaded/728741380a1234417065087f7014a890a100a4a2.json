It also contained a line hailing Moscow as \u201cthe city where they don\u2019t hold gay parades\u201d. He also rapped about \u201cwolfing down a burger to the health of Sobyanin\u201d.\n\nThe music video, which featured sweeping images of Moscow\u2019s best-known landmarks, recorded the highest number of dislikes \u2013 1.48m \u2013 for a single video on Russian YouTube. It also entered the top 30 most disliked music videos worldwide. It had 85,000 \u201clikes\u201d.\n\nTimati denied allegations that he had been paid by the government to record the track. He said he had pulled it from YouTube to stop \u201cthe wave of negativity\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s trendy to complain about the government, but I have my own opinion,\u201d he wrote on his Instagram page. \u201cInstead of going to protests, you should work and improve yourselves.\u201d\n\nTimati, whose real name is Timur Yunusov, in 2015 released a song entitled My Best Friend is Vladimir Putin that describes Russia\u2019s president as a \u201csuperhero\u201d.\n\nGuf, another rapper who contributed to the now notorious music video, apologised to his fans and said he had not even been aware elections were taking place. Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party suffered massive losses at Sunday\u2019s city council polls.\n\nMany of Russia\u2019s most famous rappers have lent their support to the newly invigorated opposition movement. Face, one of Russian rap\u2019s biggest stars, performed at an opposition rally in Moscow last month, while Oxxxymiron, an Oxford-University-educated rapper from St Petersburg, has also spoken out in support of Kremlin critics.", "description": "Timati pulls latest music video from site after it received 1.48m dislikes", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fe4b26f73dcc4bff266c05605e51aae77c9808/0_0_4193_2515/master/4193.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=703dd76d5bf95c5b58cd887dded46a47", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
