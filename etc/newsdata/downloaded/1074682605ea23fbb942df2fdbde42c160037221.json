And I ask for your forgiveness.\"\n\nSteinmeier was joined by Poland's President Andrzej Duda, who described his German counterpart as someone \"who has come with humility, with his head bowed, to pay homage ... to share the pain.\"\n\nThe two leaders observed a minute's silence at the ceremony, which began at 4:40 a.m., the moment 80 years ago when the first bombs rained down on the town's civilians. Some 6 million Polish citizens would die over the course of World War II.\n\nAlso on Sunday morning, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans marked the war's outbreak at a ceremony in Westerplatte, a peninsula where Nazi German forces attacked a Polish military base 80 years ago.\n\nTimmermans, who is Dutch, in his speech praised \"the incredible sacrifices by Polish soldiers ... who fought for six years to bring liberty to all of us.\"\n\nHe added: \"I say this in gratitude on behalf of the European Commission and the European Union as a whole. But I also say this on behalf of the Dutch nation which was liberated, in part, by Polish soldiers.\"\n\nLater on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will attend a ceremony in the capital Warsaw.\n\nPence stepped in for President Donald Trump, who cancelled his trip to Poland in order to stay in the country while a hurricane heads for Florida and Georgia.\n\nThis article was updated.", "description": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his counterpart Andrzej Duda mark the 80th anniversary of the war\u2019s outbreak on Sunday.", "authors": ["Eddy Wax", "Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165316473-1200x628.jpg"}
