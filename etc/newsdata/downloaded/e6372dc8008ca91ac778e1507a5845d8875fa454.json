The best companies in the sector could be the ones with the strongest balance sheets to take advantage of sector weakness and thrive when the market eventually takes off in 2020 as Cannabis 2.0 products hit store shelves.\n\nThe Canadian cannabis sector has already seen a few stocks blow up due to regulatory and sales issues. CannTrust (CTST) was teetering on the verge of going out of the business, but progress on regulatory compliance could have the company back in business. HEXO (HEXO) missed sales targets and slashed 2020 guidance requiring the company to raise C$70 million of 8.0% unsecured convertible debt. At the same time, Zenabis Global (ZBISF) has pulled back on capacity expansion in order to conserve cash.\n\nAll of these stocks trade down substantially from all-time highs. The questionable balance sheets and business prospects make the stocks risky even at the low.\n\nA main issue in Canada remains the size of the black market due to the government holding back on licenses for retail stores. Seaport Global sees the market needing 1,055 stores for maximum sales and profit generation and Canada is only on pace for 675 stores in 2021. Both Ontario and Quebec are adding retail stores, but both provinces will remain far under stored entering 2020.\n\nWhile the above stocks are facing liquidity concerns due to various issues in the cannabis sector or specific company problems, we\u2019ve delved into these three cannabis companies poised to thrive in an environment where the sector has to cut back on wild expansion due to a lack of positive cash flows and cash:\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC)\n\nA big player in the global cannabis sector is Canopy Growth due in large part to the investment from Constellation Brands (STZ). The large consumer beverages company invested C$5.0 billion in Canopy Growth back in 2018 providing the large cash balance to thrive in a sector where companies are finding it a difficult time to obtain cash for further expansion.\n\nThe main concern with Canopy Growth is that the company has already spent a large portion of the Constellation Brans investment only months into claiming the cash. At the end of June, the cash balance was down C$1.4 billion to C$3.1 billion. The company spent aggressively acquiring the right to Acreage Holdings (ACRGF) and buying The Works and C3 during the prior period.\n\nA smaller concern is the cash burn from operations. Canopy Growth has an alarming quarterly EBITDA loss of C$92.0 million while spending a substantial C$211.8 million on capital spending. The company has the cash to continue investing in global cannabis expansion, but investors will want to see Canopy Growth cut these quarterly losses substantially in the next couple of quarters or the cash balance won\u2019t last very long.\n\nThe stock has a mark value of $7.5 billion so a large part of the investment here is the rather large cash position of $2.4 billion. Canopy Growth has an enterprise value of $5.1 billion, but the cash burn will quickly increase this number over the next few quarters.\n\nOverall, CGC has had 8 bullish analysts in its corner over the last three months, 8 analysts playing it safe on the sidelines, and one who sees a bearish scenario in play. Importantly, the 12-month average price target of $34.81 showcases 60% in upside potential for the stock.
