kingmaker", "language": "en", "text": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Whether in protests, elections, secret negotiations or government formations, one man always seems to have the last word in Iraq\u2019s tumultuous political scene: sharp-tongued cleric Moqtada Sadr.\n\nThe onetime militiaman has earned himself a cult-like following in Iraq which he can mobilise with a single tweet to crown \u2014 or bring down \u2014 a government.\n\nHe appeared to do just that this week, endorsing mass protests in Iraq that have demanded the collapse of a government he himself brought to power only a year ago.\n\nMind-boggling politicking is par for the course when it comes to Sadr, said Renad Mansour of the London-based Chatham House think-tank.\n\n\u201cHe was concerned with how the government he formed had failed so he decided to take it down,\u201d said Mansour.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who has multiple sides: an anthropologist who goes with the street, making him inconsistent over the years.\u201d\n\nSadr, 46, was born in the southern Iraqi town of Kufa to a family with deep political roots.\n\nHis father, Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr, who was assassinated in 1999, was one of Iraq\u2019s most respected Shiite clerics and a fierce opponent of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.\n\nMoqtada Sadr is also related to Mohammad Baqer al-Sadr, the prominent thinker who was executed by Saddam in 1980.\n\nThis legacy fuelled the younger Sadr\u2019s fire, and he saw his opportunity in Saddam\u2019s 2003 ouster by a US-led invasion \u2014 which he also opposed with his Mehdi Army.\n\nSadr virtually disappeared in 2006, spending the next few years studying to become a cleric in Iran\u2019s Qom before returning to Iraq\u2019s holy city of Najaf in 2011.\n\n\u2013 Ruling reformist \u2013\n\nAs he returned to public life, Sadr began railing against corruption and its main symbol in Iraq: Baghdad\u2019s once-exclusive \u201cGreen Zone\u201d which hosts government offices and embassies.\n\nIn 2016, he held weekly Friday protests against graft in a country considered the 12th most corrupt in the world, according to Transparency International.\n\nSadr regularly dispatched his critiques to his more than 600,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nBut after years as a self-styled opposition, his Saeroon bloc won the largest share of parliament\u2019s 329 seats in elections last year.\n\nTo form a majority, he allied with the next-biggest bloc Fatah, the political arm of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, and brought Adel Abdel Mahdi as premier.\n\n\u201cSadr presents himself as an anti-establishment champion of reform and a populist voice of the millions who have been let down by the system,\u201d said Fanar Haddad, an expert at Singapore University\u2019s Middle East Institute.\n\n\u201cBut the fact remains that the Sadrists have been an integral part of the political classes and have had no shortage of ministerial posts and high ranking public office,\u201d he added.\n\nThat contradiction has been strained by the protests, which put Sadr and the Hashed on opposite sides of the swelling anti-government movement.\n\nMore than 240 people were killed and thousands wounded in rallies that erupted on October 1 in anger at unemployment and corruption before evolving into calls for regime change.\n\nAmid the protests, several Hashed offices were torched in southern Iraq in what observers said was an escalation of the rivalry between Sadr and the Hashed.\n\nBut in a slick about-face, Sadr invited Fatah chief Hadi al-Ameri late Tuesday to jointly drop their support for Abdel Mahdi.\n\n\u2013 Back to the driver\u2019s seat \u2013\n\nTheir apparent rapprochement came hours after Sadr returned from Iran, a country with which he has complex ties.\n\nHis family was long opposed to the theocratic ruling system there and Sadr even visited its regional foe Riyadh in 2017.\n\nHe shocked many when he travelled to Tehran in September, meeting both supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Major General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nAn observer who was tracking the visit said it was sparked by fears for his life.\n\n\u201cSadr was asking for protection because he was afraid he may be assassinated,\u201d the source said, citing his worsening ties to the Hashed at the time.\n\nIt was another indication of Sadr\u2019s \u201cwinding trajectory,\u201d said Karim Bitar, an international relations analyst at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.\n\n\u201cA nationalist anti-American troublemaker during the Iraq war, who we then find allied to Saudi Arabia, before he makes another radical turn again to get closer to the Iranians,\u201d Bitar said.\n\nIn the weeks since his meeting with Khamenei, Sadr has cleverly turned the tables.\n\nHe backed protests with sharp-tongued tweets as Saeroon shut down parliament with a sit-in, a show of force that ultimately scored him key political leverage.\n\nAfter landing in Najaf from Iran, he immediately drove his car to the swelling protests, finding himself in the driver\u2019s seat again.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Whether in protests, elections, secret negotiations or government formations, one man always seems to have the last word in", "authors": [], "top_image":
