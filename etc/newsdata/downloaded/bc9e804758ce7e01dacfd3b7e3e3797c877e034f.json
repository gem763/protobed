Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign sought to capitalize on the attention by offering to sell pens with the president\u2019s signature on them; a set of five went for $15.\n\n\u201cBuy the official Trump marker, which is different than every other marker on the market, because this one has the special ability to drive @CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy!\u201d Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, tweeted, adding the hashtag: \u201c#KeepMarkersGreat.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s wrath at his critics, however, left the Birmingham forecasters caught in the path of a presidential storm. For five days, NOAA had no public objection to this conclusion. Only after Mr. Trump insisted on sticking by his disputed claim did NOAA finally weigh in \u2014 and no spokesperson attached a name to the statement.\n\nThe Birmingham office had no reaction to its dressing down on Friday. A man who answered the phone there referred questions to NOAA in Washington.", "description": "The parent agency of the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham, Ala., office issued a statement admonishing it for challenging President Trump\u2019s claim about a hurricane threat to Alabama.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Sarah Mervosh"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/us/politics/07Trump-map/merlin_160193625_7150617c-bc42-4cac-9e83-7a70074d9efe-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
