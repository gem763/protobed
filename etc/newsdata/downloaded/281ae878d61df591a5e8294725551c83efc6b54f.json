Instead he said Democrats only want to find potentially embarrassing information.\n\nNeal says they need documents to examine how thoroughly the IRS audits presidents and vice presidents.\n\nNeal is now suing Trump in federal court and a hearing is scheduled for Nov 6 in Washington.\n\nTrump won\u2019t publicly release his taxes, unlike other former presidents, claiming he is under audit.\n\n\u201cI want to be assured that Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service (\u2018IRS\u2019), is enforcing the law in a fair and impartial manner and no one is endeavoring to intimidate or impede government officials and employees carrying out their duties,\u201d Neal said in a letter to Delmar.\n\nNeal wants to know everyone within Treasury, including the IRS, and anyone outside the agencies, who was \u201cinvolved in the handling of my requests and all related decisions.\u201d\n\nDelmar didn\u2019t say whether he could investigate a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint that someone tried to improperly influence the IRS audits of Trump.", "description": "Oct. 5 (UPI) \u2014 The Department of Treasury\u2019s inspector general announced he will investigate the federal agency\u2019s rejection of producing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
