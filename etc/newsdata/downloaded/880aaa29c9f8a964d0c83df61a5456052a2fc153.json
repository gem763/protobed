Listening to government minister Kwasi Kwarteng suggest tonight that independent judges doing their jobs are \"interfering\" tells us that - even though he used a classic political technique of saying he was only articulating what others were saying.\n\nWhen you listen to it remember that in this country, while it's not unusual for the courts to rule on cases relating to government business, we have an independent courts system traditionally and vitally free from political interference.\n\nThere's been a sense from day one this is a campaign to get Brexit done, rather than a traditional administration.\n\nBut the problems stacking up cannot just be dismissed as campaign upsets to be blasted away with brass neck.\n\nGovernment is not a campaign where screaming headlines and binary arguments jostle with each other over a period of a couple of months.\n\nWith no majority, the prime minister cannot simply dismiss MPs' concerns for more than a short period of time - a government that can't win votes is a government that can't last for long.\n\nWith Scotland's senior judges ruling Downing Street's behaviour broke the law, the prime minister may also soon have to reverse his decision on suspending Parliament - that depends on what the legal brains at the UK Supreme Court will conclude on Tuesday.\n\nEven though these challenges might in the end play into No 10's political narrative of \"us and them\", a tangle with the constitution is not a minor inconvenience that can just be dismissed.\n\nThose who know Boris Johnson say often that he never really believed the rules applied to him.\n\nBut as prime minister, his dreaded \"establishment\" will constrain him in some ways.\n\nAnd some old allies, who are not in the No 10 inner circle, are frankly furious that he has chosen to take such a confrontational path.\n\nRuthlessness in politics can be an attribute - any political leader who's ultimately succeeded has likely shown that.\n\nPerhaps Boris Johnson will perform a Houdini-like escape, get an EU deal and go on to govern successfully, stitching his angry and febrile party together - who knows, maybe then even winning an election?\n\nBut ruthlessness can tip in to recklessness too that could damage not just Mr Johnson's interests, not just the Tories' wider interests, but much more widely, push the two sides in our national debate further apart.\n\nThe prime minister and some of his team might revel in pushing the rules.\n\nThey have made a clear decision about taking a controversial strategy, which could ultimately be successful, from which they won't be diverted.\n\nBut there are powerful ministers in cabinet with concerns, as well as MPs in the Tory Party and the opposition.\n\nAnd ultimately of course, sooner or later, it's the public who will judge.\n\nBoris Johnson once joked about his own political style, suggesting he may sometimes take some plaster off the ceiling.\n\nBut pushing the boundaries of convention in Parliament, with the palace and perhaps the judiciary, risks bringing the whole house down too.", "description": "So far Boris Johnson's time in No 10 has suggested he believes he will profit from a divide.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4E9D/production/_108752102_575f9cb5-c447-48a8-b27a-8c11dec53f1b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
