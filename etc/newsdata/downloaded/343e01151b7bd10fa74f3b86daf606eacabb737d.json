(AP) - A treasure trove of about 130 books once owned by a renowned Abraham Lincoln biographer has been donated to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield.\n\nThe books that once belonged to Benjamin Thomas could be a gold mine for Lincoln scholars as many of them contain the author\u2019s handwritten comments, observances and notations.\n\nThe donation comes from the Lincoln Land Community College Library, which was given the books by Thomas\u2019 widow, Salome \u201cSally\u201d Pasfield Thomas, before her death in 1999.\n\nBenjamin Thomas lived in Springfield from 1932 until his death in 1956. During that time, his best-known works were published, including \u201cLincoln\u2019s New Salem\u201d in 1934 and \u201cAbraham Lincoln: A Biography\u201d in 1952.\n\n\u201c(Thomas\u2019) biography on Lincoln was kind of the gold standard for that era,\u201d Ian Hunt, the museum\u2019s chief of acquisitions, told the State Journal-Register. \u201cI would say he\u2019s still very high in the pantheon, not only because of the 1952 book, but also because he had a heavy hand in what is called the \u2018Lincoln Day-by-Day.\u2019 There are scholars who look at this research every single day (and he\u2019s) someone I go to on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nHunt accepted the collection earlier this week at a ceremony at the LLCC campus.\n\nThe books are a combination of biographies of Lincoln and other historical figures from that period, as well as Civil War reference books, Hunt said.\n\nDuring his time in Springfield, Thomas headed the Abraham Lincoln Association\u2019s research program and was also a trustee of the Illinois State Historical Library.\n\nThe books will go into a special collection at the museum, which already contains Thomas\u2019 personal papers and manuscripts.\n\n\u201cI know that we\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Tammy Kuhn-Schnell, dean of the LLCC Library, said of the donation. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to further the scholarship of Lincoln and Thomas himself into future generations.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The State Journal-Register, http://www.sj-r.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A treasure trove of about 130 books once owned by a renowned Abraham Lincoln biographer has been donated to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
