He also resigned as president of the Free Software Foundation.\n\nOn Monday, Stallman, a visiting scientist at the university's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, posted a brief message on his blog announcing the decision. \"To the MIT community, I am resigning effective immediately from my position in CSAIL at MIT,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations,\" Stallman added.\n\nIn a statement, Executive Director of the Free Software Foundation John Sullivan noted that the board will begin an immediate search for a new president.\n\nDespite Stallman's professional accolades \u2014 he has received several honorary doctorates, was given the MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" in 1990, and is considered the godfather of the free software or open source movement (though he detests the latter moniker) \u2014 he has long cut a divisive figure for his personal views.\n\nThe controversy swirling around him now stems from a series of emails from a CSAIL listserv \u2014 made public by Selam Jie Gano \u2014 in which Stallman said that a 17-year-old girl who allegedly was instructed by Epstein to have sex with AI pioneer Marvin Minsky, likely seemed \"entirely willing\" to engage in the illegal act. He also argued it is unfair to call such an incident \"sexual assault.\"\n\nMinsky, now deceased, was an MIT computer scientist accused of sexually assaulting Virginia Guiffre, who has said she was trafficked by Epstein.\n\nIn the thread, Stallman wrote, \"We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing.\"\n\nWhen a person on the email chain noted that the girl was 17 at the time, and that sex with a minor is statutory rape, Stallman replied, \"I think it is morally absurd to define 'rape' in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.\"\n\nThe remarks drew ire from computer scientists in and out of the university and they inspired some to dig through Stallman's past blog posts. That effort has since unearthed other writings in which he advocated for the legalization of pedophilia and child pornography.\n\nThe Daily Beast first reported that Stallman wrote in 2003, \"I think that everyone age 14 or above ought to take part in sex, though not indiscriminately. (Some people are ready earlier.)\" In 2006, he wrote, \"I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily [sic] pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.\"\n\nStallman's departure follows that of MIT Media Lab Director Joichi Ito earlier this month. He also left amid scandal after an article by The New Yorker revealed the lab tried to conceal its financial relationship with Epstein.\n\nThe disgraced financier who committed suicide in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges had been involved in landing gifts from others of about $7.5 million.\n\nIn a letter to the MIT community, CSAIL Director Daniela Rus said the university will work with Stallman \"to come up with a transition plan.\"\n\n\"We thank him for his technical contributions to the lab, to the free-software movement, and to the wider computer-science community over the decades,\" Rus wrote.\n\n\"Recent events have also prompted me and other senior leadership at the lab to focus on having a discussion on how we can improve the ways we respectfully work with one another in this community. This includes ongoing conversations about the future of the CSAIL-related listserv.\"\n\nStallman did not immediately reply to NPR requests for comment.", "description": "\"I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations,\" Richard Stallman wrote on his blog.", "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/17/gettyimages-489592568_wide-5ca597881feda728aac8a0ae17d2d4fd6581ea1c.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
