He said, in a series of tweets, that the social media giant would stop all political advertising globally in order to inhibit the spread of misinformation and to ensure that political reach was earned, not bought.\n\nClinton, who had tweeted just hours earlier condemning Facebook\u2019s stance on allowing misinformation in political advertising, immediately praised Twitter for the move, which she characterized as the \u201cright thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world.\u201d\n\nThis is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world.\n\n\n\nWhat say you, @Facebook? https://t.co/dRgipKHzUG \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 30, 2019\n\nFacebook's decision to allow false information in political advertisements is appalling.\n\n\n\nVoters are being confronted by millions of pieces of misinformation.\n\n\n\nA world where up is down and down is up is a world where democracy can't thrive. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cWhat say you, @Facebook?\u201d she added.\n\nThe former Democratic presidential candidate was plagued by issues with Facebook during her 2016 campaign against Donald Trump, which she blames, in part, for her loss.\n\nClinton says she was subjected to an unprecedented campaign of disinformation and social engineering on the platform, orchestrated by Russian agents and bots.\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned at a congressional hearing about the company\u2019s proposed digital currency, which it is calling Libra. The hearing turned into a grilling on a wide range of issues with the platform, including privacy, data use and the spread of false information.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) demanded Zuckerberg explain whether Facebook would hypothetically allow her to run false political ads claiming Republicans had voted for the Green New Deal. After first being unable to answer, the Facebook exec said, \u201cProbably.\u201d\n\nHis defense of his company\u2019s policy was that, although \u201clying is bad,\u201d it is not within a tech company\u2019s mandate to determine what politicians can or cannot say.\n\nLast month, Facebook (as well as Twitter and YouTube) refused to remove an ad run by the Trump reelection campaign that pushed debunked claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The Biden campaign condemned the platforms for allowing the ad.\n\nOther Democrats have challenged Facebook\u2019s policy, including 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was able to run a fake ad that claimed Zuckerberg endorsed Trump for 2020.\n\nHowever, when a left-wing political action group ran a version of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s hypothetical ad on Friday, claiming that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) supported the Green New Deal, Facebook halted paid distribution of the ad, saying that different rules applied for political action groups versus politicians.\n\nThe Biden campaign also praised Twitter\u2019s Wednesday announcement, calling it \u201cencouraging\u201d that the company chose integrity over revenue.\n\nThe Trump campaign slammed the move. Campaign manager Brad Parscale issued a statement calling it \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d and a \u201cvery dumb decision for their stockholders\u201d to walk away from \u201cmillions of dollars of potential revenue.\u201d\n\nTwitter bans political ads in yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if @twitter lifted the ban after 2020.\n\n\n\nStatement: pic.twitter.com/4ZdHGJw3js \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 30, 2019", "description": "The former Democratic presidential candidate has been outspoken about Facebook allowing the spread of misinformation on its platform.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dba0342210000343834b849.jpeg?cache=bndpwh4u6u&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
