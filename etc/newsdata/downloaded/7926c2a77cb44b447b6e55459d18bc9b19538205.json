This was below the \u00a3677m predicted by analysts and shares tumbled 20 per cent\n\nBosses said this was partly because of glitches that affected the technology behind its advertising services and partly because of unusually-low demand over the summer, when fewer big events had taken place compared to the previous year.\n\nNed Segal, Twitter's chief financial officer, said the bugs 'affected our ability to target ads and share data with partners'.\n\nHe added: 'Despite its challenges, this quarter validates our strategy of investing to drive long-term growth.'\n\nBut the problems triggered a slump in shares, with the company warning they were likely to affect the fourth quarter as well.\n\nTesla back in the fast lane Tesla shares shot up after it unexpectedly returned to the black. The electric car maker's stock surged by as much as 20 per cent when trading in the US opened, hours after it stunned Wall Street with a \u00a3111million third quarter profit. It was only the fifth quarter in Tesla's 16-year history that it has avoided a loss. It notched up losses of \u00a3855million in the first half of 2019. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, described the profit as a 'jaw dropper'.\n\nBefore the announcement, Twitter had been valued at about \u00a323billion but the early drop saw more than \u00a34billion wiped off that figure.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and chief executive, insisted the company was in 'its strongest position ever'.\n\n'We're much better equipped to identify and fix issues we come across today than we were just one to two years ago,' he told analysts, adding such problems were 'still painful but no longer existential'.\n\nTwitter said 145million daily active users saw its ads, better than an expected 141million.\n\nBut the company told investors it was expecting fourth quarter revenues of between \u00a3728million and \u00a3782million, well below Wall Street predictions of about \u00a3821million.\n\nBen Marder, associate professor of marketing at Edinburgh University's Business School, warned the company would also be tested in the coming months ahead of the 2020 US elections.\n\nHe warned that so-called 'deepfakes' \u2013 realistic-looking videos showing someone saying or doing something that they did not actually do \u2013 had the potential to 'cause havoc'.", "description": "Twitter reported sales of about \u00a3638m for the three months to September 30, up from \u00a3587m during the same period last year.\nHowever, it was below the \u00a3677m predicted.
