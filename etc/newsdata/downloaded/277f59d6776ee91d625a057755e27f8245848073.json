'They had what was called the \"hot seat\" and every prisoner that was in a group had to sit in the hot seat and they were bombarded - it was like an interrogation.'\n\nThe government's scheme for people convicted of rape or child sexual abuse in England and Wales was scrapped in 2017 (file photo)\n\nGiving his name only as Paul, the 60-year-old discussed his involvement in the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP), which was founded in the early 1990s.\n\nPaul is currently serving a long prison sentence and has been convicted of rape among other offences.\n\nHe says he started SOTP on three separate occasions as a form of cognitive therapy aiming to help offenders think and act in different ways.\n\nBut facilitators removed him from the programme each time because they believed he was learning anything, he claims.\n\nPaul believes that discussing serious offences in a group setting normalised the behaviour inherent in their crimes.\n\nAnd he also thinks that serious offenders sharing details of their crimes with convicts who'd committed less serious abuse made the latter inmates 'worse'.\n\nIn such sessions, rapists, child sex offenders and murderers would be placed with people guilty of indecent exposure, he says.\n\n'People were learning from their mistakes - they were learning from other group members how to perhaps be better sex offenders without being caught,' he said.\n\nTen per cent of the men who completed SOTP reoffended, compared with eight per cent of those who had not enrolled in the scheme, the Ministry of Justice found.\n\nThe MoJ published its results five years after Kathryn Hopkins raised concerns that the scheme might be failing.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice (pictured) found that 10 per cent of those who took part in the SOTP would reoffend\n\nPaul said that prisoners were encouraged to reveal their victims' names and go into graphic detail about their history.\n\nDr Robert Forde, a retired forensic psychologist who used to work for the Home Office, shares many of his concerns.\n\nHe told the programme that an inmate had said to him: 'I hate doing this course because I've never had so many deviant sexual thoughts as I've had since I started because we're talking about sex offending all the time and actually I want to get away from all that.'\n\nOne prisoner, who was abused as a child, told him that he was required to detail his ordeals in front of paedophiles, who became aroused by what he was saying.\n\nAnd another told Dr Forde that if you could trick the system by claiming to have deviant thoughts then dropping them during the post-course assessment.\n\nHe said the prisoners could secure a lower risk score by engaging in such a deception.\n\nA former inmate calling himself Peter, aged in his 50s, served two sentences for sex offences against children as well as possessing indecent images.\n\nHe said that the SOTP provides a false feeling that you've been fixed but in reality just forces you to relive offences.\n\nThe ex-prisoner believes that to become a useful member of society, inmates need to learn how to move forward.\n\nPeter says that the Healthy Sex Programme was more helpful because it focused on steps to overcoming his issues in one-to-one sessions.\n\nHe is currently seeking support at the Corbett Centre in Nottingham, which offers help and support for about 30 sex offenders.\n\nIt is not yet known whether the scheme at the Corbett Centre reduces reoffending in the long term.\n\nThe Healthy Sex Programme is being evaluated and Horizon and Kaizen, which replaced the SOTP, have not yet been tested.\n\nThe MoJ told the BBC that it works closely with the Correctional Services Accreditation and Advice Panel when designing prison and probation programmes.\n\nThe department says that independent experts from across the world for the panel, which must approve schemes before use.\n\nBut forensic psychiatrists Penny Brown and Callum Ross are so alarmed by the SOTP's failings that they are demanding greater oversight of new treatment.\n\nThe Lancet Psychiatry medical journal published a paper they have written in this week's edition.\n\nDr Brown said she wants reassurance that government policy research is under as much scrutiny as all other scientists.\n\nShe added that the need to show that you're taking action should not override the risk of causing harm.", "description": "Two sex offenders have revealed what taking part in the Sex Offender Treatment Programme for England and Wales entailed and why they think it worsens some inmates.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/23/19466422-0-image-a-47_1570575204058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
