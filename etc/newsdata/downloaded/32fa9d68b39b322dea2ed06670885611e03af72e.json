No one likes to think about dying or about someone else raising their children. But if you get no further than scribbling notes or thinking about which lawyer to hire, you risk dying \u201cintestate\u201d \u2014 without a will that could guide your loved ones, head off family feuds and potentially save your family thousands of dollars.\n\nFinancial planners say getting people to stop procrastinating on this important money chore can be tough. I asked several advisers to offer their best strategies for getting clients to get this done. Maybe one of these will help you.\n\nRemember whom you\u2019re doing it for\n\nCertified financial planner Katrina Soelter of Los Angeles suggests thinking of an estate plan as \u201cthe best love letter you can write to those you love.\u201d Providing guidance on what you want to happen after your death \u2014 and who you want to care for minor children or pets \u2014 can be a huge gift to those you leave behind. You\u2019re also saving them the potentially large costs and delays of hiring attorneys to sort out your estate later.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: You could live 24% longer, thanks to your dog\n\nSoelter says she procrastinated on her own estate planning and finds the positive approach works better than browbeating.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to heap more shame on them, but rather focus on the reasons why it is wonderful to get it done,\u201d Soelter says.\n\nVisualize what happens without a will\n\nThen again, some people need to hear worst-case scenarios before they\u2019ll act. Financial planners often point out, for example, that without an estate plan a court could end up deciding who takes care of your kids. State law determines who inherits your stuff, and the distribution may not be as you would want.\n\nCFP Janice Cackowski of Rocky River, Ohio, says one of her clients recently died after ignoring her advice to create a trust. His will bequeathed his estate to his financially irresponsible son, with no restrictions.\n\nAlso read: \u2018Netiquette\u2019 tips for responding to death and grief on social media\n\n\u201cThe money my client saved over his 63-year lifetime will be gone within 18 months of his death,\u201d Cackowski says.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nCFP Kevin Gahagan of San Francisco notes that getting a basic estate plan in place may not be as complicated or expensive as you fear.\n\n\u201cIt is the attorney who does the work,\u201d Gahagan says. \u201cThey\u2019ll guide you in identifying the questions you need to answer so a plan can be developed.\u201d\n\nAlso, think about what you\u2019d want to happen if you died in the next five years, rather than trying to create an estate plan that covers all eventualities, says CFP Karen E. Van Voorhis of Norwell, Massachusetts. You can always update and change things.\n\nUse employee benefits\n\nMany big companies offer their employees access to attorneys through prepaid legal services, says CFP Amy Shepard of Mesa, Arizona. That\u2019s how she and her husband, Michael, created their estate plan. They met with an attorney affiliated with the service, which cost less than $10 per biweekly pay period when he was employed by Wells Fargo. WFC, +0.73%\n\n\u201cFor most people, the biggest thing stopping them is money,\u201d Shepard says. \u201cIf their employer offers a legal benefit, it can make the process of doing an estate plan very affordable and very simple.\u201d\n\nGiven that attorneys often charge $300 and up for a will, while a living trust can cost $1,200 or more, prepaid legal services can be a cost-effective option for many people, Shepard says.\n\nRelated: Online wills may save you money, but they can lay these estate-planning traps\n\nAffordable options for those who aren\u2019t offered coverage through their employer may include online services such as Rocket Lawyer and LegalZoom, which are best for people with simple situations, such as those who don\u2019t have a lot of assets and who don\u2019t need trusts, Shepard says. But users need to answer the sites\u2019 questions carefully and get the resulting documents notarized, or the paperwork won\u2019t be valid.\n\nSet a timeline\n\nVan Voorhis also suggests making an appointment with an attorney now but scheduling it for a few months down the road.\n\n\u201cThat way it\u2019s on the books and they\u2019ll feel like they\u2019ve accomplished something, but they also don\u2019t have to face it for a while,\u201d she says.\n\nCFP Mike Giefer of Minneapolis recommends incremental deadlines.\n\n\u201cBy Oct. 1, have the conversation about guardians, charities and other estate intentions. By Nov. 1, have the initial meeting with an estate planning attorney. By Dec. 1, clarify and confirm the documents and have them signed before the holidays,\u201d Giefer suggests. \u201cOn Jan. 1, 2020, they are done!\u201d\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Writing a will is a tough chore.
