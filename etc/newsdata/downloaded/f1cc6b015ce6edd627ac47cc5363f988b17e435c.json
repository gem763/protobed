Mercifully, though, \u201cI make a conscious choice not to use it in a social setting because it\u2019s very, very powerful.\u201d Maaate, will you listen to yourself?\n\n\u201cWe still get caught out,\u201d he admitted, citing his 90 per cent success rate.\n\nWell how\u2019s this for a 10 percenter? On Livewire\u2019s April 27, 2017 episode of Buy Hold Sell, Kessler threw his weight behind sandalwood fraud, Quintis (previously known as TFS Corporation). \u201cWe actually hold it \u2026 I think it\u2019s a real business and very, very cheap,\u201d he insisted, sitting alongside Quintis short seller Ben McGarry of Totus Capital. It closed that day at $1.21 and not three weeks later (on May 12), the stock traded for the final time. Pengana had itself a donut (unless it bailed in the interim \u2013 and we note it didn\u2019t appear in the top 25 shareholders upon its suspension).\n\nFor us, Kessler\u2019s most alarming defence of Quintis was that \u201cthe board \u2026 has done their due diligence, they\u2019re all reputable people.\u201d Surely no money manager would use the ostensible respectability of a company\u2019s directors as a green flag?\n\nNeed we catalogue Enron\u2019s board: A business school dean, the CEOs of several other companies, an economist and one of Britain\u2019s foremost experts on accounting. All reputable people! As Marianne Jennings noted in The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse, \u201cEnron\u2019s board was a model in corporate governance if it were to be judged by the standards of those who have given us the ideal board structure for effective corporate governance.\u201d But then, see, Professor Jennings never trained with the FBI. That Kenneth Lay would not have fooled Kessler for a second.
