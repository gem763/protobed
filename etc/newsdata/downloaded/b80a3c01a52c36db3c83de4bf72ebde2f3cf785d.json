BTC has held on to five figures as we begin the weekend and bigger things could be in store as open interest mounts up.\n\nBinance and BitMEX Building Up Bitcoin\n\nLooking at on-chain flows for the past 24 hours shows positive action going on at a number of the world\u2019s largest exchanges. The inflow has exceeded the outflow of bitcoin on Binance, BitMEX and Bitstamp indicating that accumulation has started to occur.\n\nWhile prices across the board have taken a slight dip over the past 24 hours, bitcoin price remains relatively stable within its consolidation range. Since the same time, last Saturday BTC has gained almost 8% but has yet to form a clear direction.\n\nThat could be all about to change as the futures market heats back up. Open interest is a measure total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled for an asset. It provides a good picture of trading activity and direction of monetary flow.\n\nFor BitMEX at least it is the fourth time this summer that OI has reached $1 billion which is a bullish signal.\n\nBitmex open interest \u2013 4th attempt this summer > $1bln Fasten your seatbelt! pic.twitter.com/cE9m43PX16 \u2014 skew (@skew_markets) September 6, 2019\n\nYesterday, crypto trader \u2018Cantering Clark\u2019 noted that overall OI was almost the highest it has been this year so, despite the sideways price action, bitcoin appears to be generating momentum.\n\n\u201cAlmost the highest OI that we have had all year. I tell you what, this area is either going to be one hell of a base or one hell of a trap.\u201d\n\nAlmost the highest OI that we have had all year.

Back when bitcoin market share was at a similar level it was priced around $2,500 with a market cap of roughly $40 billion. A lot has changed since then with BTC prices and market cap being four times higher now.\n\nAll of this action may have been driven by Bakkt which has just activated its warehouse custody services in preparation for final futures launch later this month.\n\n\u201cNow accepting customer bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. Only 17 days until the Bakkt Daily and Monthly Futures contracts launch on Sep 23.\u201d\n\nBakkt Warehouse custody is live. Now accepting customer bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. Only 17 days until the Bakkt Daily and Monthly Futures contracts launch on Sep 23. \u2014 Bakkt (@Bakkt) September 6, 2019\n\nAs we have seen every time bitcoin price drops into four figures, it does not remain there very long. A large amount of accumulation is clearly happening and a lot of it could be in anticipation of further institutional interest in Q4 this year.\n\nWill bitcoin price surge later this year?
