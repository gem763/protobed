This year\u2019s Zombie Pizza from Aoki\u2019s Pizza is called \u201cChimamire Zombino,\u201d or \u201cBlood-covered Zombino.\u201d It looks like a zombie emerging from the pizza crust Earth to search for human flesh with its olive eyes.\n\nWhile this year\u2019s zombie pizza may seem less gory than previous years\u2019, 2019\u2019s spooky pie is arguably the healthiest of them all. It\u2019s basically a prosciutto salad with lettuce, sausages, and the teriyaki chicken sauce base that Aoki\u2019s is famous for.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Aoki\u2019s Pizza, it\u2019s a Japanese delivery pizza chain that serves mainly the areas of Aichi, Gifu, Shizuoka, and Mie prefectures. Should you happen to be in the area and are interested in having one of these horrifying meals delivered to you, you\u2019ll have to pay 2,600 yen for a medium or 4,200 yen for a large. All pies come with a pizza cutter included.\n\nBetween Aoki\u2019s Black Thunder pizza and Meat Mountain, we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get bored with this highly original chain. We\u2019d even so go far as to say they\u2019ve served up this Halloween\u2019s most appropriate meal. Grab yours before Halloween!\n\nSources: Value Press, Twitter/@aokis_pizza\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japan now has a giant pizza sandwich called Meat Mountain, packed with 18 different types of meat\n\n-- Domino\u2019s Pizza now sells Tsundere Pizzas in Japan, wants to both hurt and please you\n\n-- Horror pizza lives!
