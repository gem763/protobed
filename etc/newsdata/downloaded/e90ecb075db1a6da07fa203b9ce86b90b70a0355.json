Show Hide The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson's government leaving the EU without a deal. It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal. If neither of those conditions are met \u2013 and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on 'super Saturday' \u2013 it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act. The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests. Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 Martin Belam\n\n\u201cLet us go for a deal that can heal this country and allow us all to express our legitimate desires for the deepest possible friendship and partnership with our neighbours. A deal that allows us to create a new shared destiny with them.\u201d\n\nLetwin said he was minded to support Johnson\u2019s deal, but the aim of his amendment was \u201cto keep in place the insurance policy provided by the Benn act, which prevents us from crashing out automatically if there is no deal by 31 October\u201d.\n\nDowning Street has repeatedly insisted it will comply with the requirements of the Benn act, which forces the PM to write to the EU and request an extension if he has not received parliamentary support for his deal by the deadline. But Johnson has also insisted he will not delay Brexit.\n\nHe hinted in his speech that EU leaders could rebuff Britain\u2019s request for a delay, if he is forced to make it. \u201cI must tell the house in all candour that there is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told MPs: \u201cWhatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d\n\nAfter being defeated on the Letwin amendment, the government made clear that it would boycott the follow-up vote on the amended motion, which Downing Street sources said had now been rendered \u201cmeaningless\u201d.\n\nBefore Letwin tabled his amendment, Downing Street had appeared tantalisingly close to achieving majority support for the last-minute deal the prime minister secured on Thursday, which outlines a looser economic relationship with the EU.\n\nArdent Eurosceptics including Mark Francois and Bill Cash had signalled that they would support the deal, despite the objections of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP).\n\nAnd several Labour MPs, including Melanie Onn and Sarah Champion, who had rejected Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, signalled that they too were ready to vote with the government.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s backing was key to the success of Letwin\u2019s amendment, after they rejected Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on Thursday.\n\nIn a passionate speech to the Commons, DUP politician Sammy Wilson said that the agreement cut off Northern Ireland from the country \u201cto which we belong\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will not give in to this agreement which we believe does damage to our part of the United Kingdom and which will lead to the focus of attention away from London, towards Dublin.\n\n\u201cBecause don\u2019t forget we will be tied into an arrangement where the laws for Northern Ireland are made in Brussels, the British government will have no input, the Stormont government will have no interest \u2026 so we move towards a united Ireland.\u201d\n\nOn the Letwin amendment, he said: \u201cWe would be failing in our duty if we do not use every strategy which is available to try and give guarantees, changes and alterations which will safeguard the interests of the United Kingdom, our constituents and the interests we represent.\u201d", "description": "Commons backs Letwin move, meaning PM is legally bound to request EU extension", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f9564cf32947d50b989adc5d0a1cbbf8f34d5c/0_31_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=12b23bf8e508a55a1315eb5e0a495141", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
