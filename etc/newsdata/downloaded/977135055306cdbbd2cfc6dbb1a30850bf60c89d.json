Although women tend to mostly property crimes, their involvement has increased across every type of crime.", "description": "A new campaign by European crime agency Europol is shining a light on the \"most-wanted\" female fugitives.", "authors": ["Viola Stefanello"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/37/46/1000x563_cmsv2_a8df9f28-f9fd-5813-ae28-888addcce59d-4243746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
