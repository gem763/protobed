urged to pay \u00a3750,000 bonus to staff who lost their jobs", "language": "en", "text": "Former chief executive Peter Fankhauser was grilled by Labour MP Rachel Reeves (Picture: UK Parliament/Getty)\n\nThe former boss of Thomas Cook is facing demands to repay bonuses to workers who were left jobless after the company\u2019s dramatic collapse.\n\nEx-chief executive Peter Fankhauser earned a \u00a3750,000 bonus in 2017, 30 per cent of which was in shares, a cross-party committee of MPs heard.\n\nHe said sorry to employees who \u2018worked extremely hard and tirelessly\u2019 but was told his apology \u2018rings rather hollow\u2019 unless he is willing to \u2018put something back\u2019.\n\nCommittee chair and Labour MP Rachel Reeves said his bonus money could be \u2018put to better purpose\u2019 such as redundancy payments or compensation for taxpayers.\n\nAlthought the Government refused to stump up the \u00a3200m needed to keep its business afloat, it did spend \u00a3100 million bringing some 150,000 stranded tourists home.\n\nHe said he will \u2018consider\u2019 paying back some of his bonus money to jobless staff (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe company\u2019s collapse affected 21,000 jobs worldwide, 9,000 of which were in the UK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Fankhauser is one of five former board members giving evidence to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee.\n\nHe said how \u2018deeply sorry we are that we couldn\u2019t save this iconic brand\u2019 and apologised for the disress caused to millions of customers and suppliers who were \u2018loyal to us throughout this time\u2019.\n\nWhen asked about redistributing his bonus payments, he said he will \u2018consider what is right but I\u2019m not going to decide that today\u2019.\n\nWoman screams 'I'm not a beast' as she's found guilty of child abuse\n\nMr Fankhauser has taken home \u00a38.4 million since 2014, including \u00a34.6 million in bonus payments, it has been reported.\n\nDirectors of the world\u2019s oldest travel company have been accused of treating themselves to \u00a347 million in pay and bonuses over the past 10 years.\n\nThe hearing was attended by several former Thomas Cook workers who were dressed in their uniforms.\n\nThe closure affected 21,000 jobs worldwide, 9,000 of which were in the UK (Picture:

he had no contact with UK ministers in the six day running up to Thomas Cook going into liquidation on the morning of Monday, September 23.\n\nPrince Harry breaks down as he recalls Meghan's pregnancy

Mr Fankhauser said: \u2018We were instructed and heavily advised by the transport ministry that they are the single point of contact.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe committee was quick to question some of the accounting policies, including the decision to include a \u00a32.5 billion \u2018goodwill\u2019 value on the business in 2018.\n\nMs Reeves said huge sums dismised as \u2018exceptional\u2019 costs came back to bite (Picture: UK Parliament)\n\nMPs also asked the bosses why they based bonuses on profits that excluded one-off payments to pay for the restructuring.\n\nA total of \u00a31.8 billion was written off as \u2018exceptional\u2019 costs over eight years.\n\nMs Reeves said: \u2018The proof of the pudding is somewhat in the eating and you failed to turn around this business.\n\n\u2018In the end you couldn\u2019t just hide these numbers (exceptional costs) forever, they caught up with you.\u2019\n\nShe also called the former Thomas Cook chairman Frank Meysman \u2018deluded\u2019 over the collapse.\n\nMs Reeves added: \u2018You can point to as many successes as you like, but you have brought down a 178-year business with huge repercussions for customers, staff and taxpayers.\n\n\u2018You can point to the successes, but I\u2019ll point to the failures, and they hugely outweigh the successes you\u2019ve spoken about.\n\n(Left to right) Thomas Cook remuneration committee chair Warren Tucker, CFO Sten Daugaard, CEO Peter Fankhauser, chairman Frank Meysman and audit committee chair Martine Verluyten (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018I think you\u2019re deluded, Mr Meysman, about the business you ran.\u2019\n\nGiving evidence to the committee at a separate hearing, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she was told about Thomas Cook\u2019s struggles a month before the travel firm collapsed.\n\nBut she said helping it financially would have been akin to \u2018throwing good money after bad\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked why the Government did not bail the travel company out, Ms Leadson told MPs: \u2018It was quite clearly the fact that the \u00a3200 million plus \u2013 and I can only speak for the final endgame \u2013 that the company was looking for would only have dealt with it in the short term.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
