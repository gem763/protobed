Wold said mountain lions are on the verge of becoming endangered in California.\n\nGonzalez had been charged with two misdemeanor counts, one for the unlawful taking of a protected mammal and one for vandalism of National Park Service property over the cutting of the lion\u2019s collar, which Wold said was \u201cvery sophisticated\u201d and is worth more than $2,300. The collar maintained data on the mountain lion.\n\nMOUNTAIN LION SPOTTED PROWLING CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD PROMPTS WARNING\n\nGonzalez\u2019 attorney, Shanit Frydman, did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nHe is expected to begin his jail sentence on October 25, followed by 30 days of work release and then 240 hours of community service.\n\n\u201cBecause the defendant took early responsibility for his actions and has no prior criminal history I think it [the sentence] is fair and reasonable on the part of the court,\" Wold said. \"I think that this particular case is a great deterrent that will send a message to anyone who would want to kill a protected mountain lion.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "The Southern\u00a0California\u00a0man charged with\u00a0shooting and killing a protected mountain lion this summer has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and was ordered to serve 240 hours of community service in an animal shelter after pleading guilty, prosecutors said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
