Sze said of Leung, who also participated in Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 pro-democracy protests.\n\nLeung was sentenced last June in connection with February 2016 unrest in the working-class Mong Kok district. It was unclear whether his appeal was successful, according to the AP.\n\nLeung\u2019s attorneys told the court that his sentence was disproportionate to his role and that more violent protesters received lighter sentences, according to Reuters. Supporters wore black masks, defying a ban Lam has invoked as the protests show no signs of flagging.\n\nProtesters originally took to the streets four months ago after Lam introduced a bill that would allow certain criminal suspects to be extradited to China, but have continued since she withdrew the legislation.", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong reportedly demonstrated Wednesday in front of the city\u2019s High Court to call for the release of activist Edward Leung, who\u00a0was\u00a0appealing a six-year prison sentence relating to clashes with police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hongkong_100119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
