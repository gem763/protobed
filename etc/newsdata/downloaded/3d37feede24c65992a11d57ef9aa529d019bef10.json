Seven months later, it happened again.\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday issued his second veto against legislation seeking to end his national emergency at the southwestern border, rejecting bipartisan objections to his efforts to obtain funds for a border wall. His move, announced late Tuesday night, was expected and will return the resolution to Congress. It is unlikely to garner the two-thirds majority needed there to override the veto.\n\nIn case this isn\u2019t obvious, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that if Trump were politically confident about his position, and certain that the American mainstream was on his side about redirecting funds in defiance of Congress\u2019 wishes, he wouldn\u2019t have issued the veto late at night \u2013 during a Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nNevertheless, this caught my eye for a couple of reasons. The first is that Trump may yet have to veto this same measure again. As regular readers may recall, under the National Emergencies Act, Congress can vote every six months on the president\u2019s emergency declaration. Senate Democratic leaders have already forced the issue onto the floor twice \u2013 under these circumstances, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can\u2019t block a vote \u2013 and they\u2019ll likely do so again in the spring.\n\nThe second area of interest is the rarity of Trump\u2019s use of his veto pen. For those keeping score, the list of measures vetoed by the Republican is quite short:\n\n1. March 15, 2019: Trump vetoed a congressional effort to block his emergency declaration related to border barriers.\n\n2. April 16, 2019: Trump vetoed a measure to end U.S. involvement in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\n\n3, 4, and 5. July 24, 2019: Trump vetoed three measures related to Saudi arms deals.\n\n6. October 15, 2019: Trump vetoed another congressional effort to block his emergency declaration related to border barriers.\n\nOr put another way, Trump has issued four vetoes intended to help Saudi Arabia, and two vetoes to redirect funds to the border in defiance of Congress\u2019 wishes.\n\nNevertheless, Trump is on track to have the fewest vetoes of any American president since Warren Harding, whose presidency only lasted two years (1921 to 1923).", "description": "Trump has issued four vetoes intended to help Saudi Arabia, and two vetoes to redirect funds to the border in defiance of Congress' wishes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/afp_m07vw.jpg?itok=r7tI2Y79", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
