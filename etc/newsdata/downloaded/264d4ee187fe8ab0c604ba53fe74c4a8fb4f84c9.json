That makes it a \u201ccritical part\u201d of the Justice Department\u2019s case charging Stone with lying to Congress and obstruction of justice, the government said in a filing on Thursday.\n\nThe department earlier this summer had asked U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson for permission to show the film scene during Stone\u2019s trial, which is scheduled to start Nov. 5 in Washington and last at least two weeks.\n\nBut Stone\u2019s lawyers objected , and during a pretrial hearing last month maintained that the clip could prejudice the jury into making connections between the defendant and the Mafia. Jackson acknowledged their point and urged both sides to find an alternative.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s five-page filing, the Justice Department said those talks didn\u2019t go well. Stone\u2019s attorneys rejected a plan that would have involved jurors being read a jointly written statement describing the scene. Instead, they said, the film should come up only if witnesses talked about it during the trial.\n\n\u201cIn the government\u2019s view, this confirms the importance of playing the short scene for the jury,\u201d the Justice Department prosecutors told Jackson. \u201cThat scene played a direct part in the very obstructive acts charged in this case.\u201d\n\nA breakdown in talks over the \u201cGodfather\u201d scene puts the issue back before Jackson, who is scheduled to hold another pretrial conference one day before jury selection begins on Nov. 4.\n\n", "description": "The Justice Department and Roger Stone\u2019s attorneys remain in a standoff over whether jurors should be shown a clip from \u201cThe Godfather, Part II\u201d during the longtime Donald Trump associate\u2019s upcoming trial.
