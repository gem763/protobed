Our thirst for boozy advent calendars has shown no signs of slowing down and this year brands have outdone themselves, launching exclusive new flavours and limited editions to whet our appetite.\n\nGin undoubtedly reigns supreme \u2013 we could have written an entire roundup on this alone \u2013 but that\u2019s not the only holy spirit available. There are also rum, vodka and whisky creations as well as all wine and beer calendars to tempt you. Can\u2019t decide? Choose one that mixes up categories to keep you on your toes throughout December.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a fan of a specific spirit or keen to broaden your horizons and get your chops around artisan, boutique brands, we\u2019ve found the best of the best.\n\nBefore making your selection, do note that some of these calendars only have 12 doors, with others treating you to the full 25. Other things to consider before handing over your cash is where you\u2019re going to house your calendar \u2013 some take up a considerable amount of room, especially important if you\u2019re planning on transporting it or giving as a gift.\n\nThe best advent calendars always sell out fast, so if you\u2019re keen to count down with us, it\u2019s best to buy your favourite ASAP.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nThat Boutique-y Gin Company advent calendar: \u00a349.95, Master of Malt\n\nForget your bog standard fruit-infused gin, That Boutique-y Gin Company is well known for always pushing the boundaries of what can be infused with gin. Over half of this calendar is packed with completely new flavours for 2019, including the bonkers sounding fresh rain gin, the invigorating cold-brew coffee gin and the deliciously savoury smoked rosemary gin. The other half features the brands best-sellers like moonshot gin (with botanicals actually sent into space, including real moon rock), spit-roasted pineapple and yuletide gin made with gold, frankincense and myrrh. With 24 drams included, we think this represents great value.\n\nBuy now\n\nVirgin Wines advent calendar: \u00a369.99, Virgin Wines\n\nWe were smitten with last year\u2019s Virgin wine calendar so imagine our delight when we found out this year the company is giving us the option of all red, all white or the original mixed version as well as a beer and gin one. As in previous years, the selection is made up of 24 of Virgin\u2019s highest rated wines, made into miniature form. The packaging has been updated though, this time looking like a giant gift box \u2013 which let\u2019s face it, it is. This one\u2019s sold out fast year after year, so we suggest getting in there early if you\u2019re going to be in with a chance of waking up to a daily vino.\n\nAvailable to reserve now\n\nAdnams 12 days of Christmas box: \u00a359.99, Adnams\n\nFor those that simply can\u2019t make up their mind, the Adnams advent calendar offers 12 miniatures from across its range, including gin, beer and wine.

You\u2019ll get to try its aromatic copper house gin which was voted best gin at the International Wine & Spirit Competition in 2017, as well as a couple of variations on the good ol\u2019 G&T in a can. Wine wise there\u2019s a juicy Argentinian malbec, a sauvignon blanc from New Zealand\u2019s infamous Marlborough region and even a mini bottle of prosecco. The other half of the box is comprised of the best of the brand\u2019s brewery \u2013 with lagers, ciders and pale ales waiting to be found. However, do note, there are just 12 treats, not the full 24!\n\n\n\nAvailable October 15\n\nFever Tree gin & tonic advent calendar: \u00a360, Waitrose\n\nIf Fever Tree is your tonic of choice, this is the perfect opportunity to mix and match your G\u2019s to your T\u2019s.
