The network, which outbid Lance Bass last year to purchase the Studio City, Calif. home that was once used for the beloved series\u2019 exterior shots, has \u2014 with the hands-on help of all six actors who played the Brady kids \u2014 uncannily transformed the house\u2019s interior into an exact replica of the sitcom\u2019s set.\n\nFrom the leaky clay pot that was once shattered by the Brady boys\u2019 errant basketball to the Kitty Carryall doll reclining on Cindy\u2019s bed, from the beaded hippie curtains in Greg\u2019s attic bachelor pad to the vintage olive green appliances in the kitchen where Alice used to make her porkchops and applesauce and pineapple upside-down cake, from long-missing family pet Tiger\u2019s paisley-curtained wooden doghouse to the iconic shag-carpeted staircase, HGTV has spared absolutely no detail. Stepping through those blue doors and into that cobblestone-walled entryway is like stepping into a groovy portal to 1969.\n\nHowever, there is one addition to the Brady home that isn\u2019t true to the original: There\u2019s finally an actual running toilet in the Brady kids\u2019 shared \u201cJack & Jill\u201d bathroom. A half-century ago, network standards and practices dictated that toilets could not be shown on television before 10 p.m. But to loosely quote a famous hit by the Brady 6, it was time to change and rearrange.\n\nThe Brady Bunch actors recreate their iconic pose on the famous Brady house staircase.
