But Christie\u2019s sold an even more monumental example, Anthropom\u00e9trie \"Le Buffle\" (ANT 93), 1960-61, which is about 70 inches by 110 inches, in May 2010.\n\nLe Buffle sold for $12.4 million, with fees, the highest known price for a work from the series at auction. At the current estimate, Barbara (ANT 113) could possibly achieve a record.\n\nBarbara (ANT 113) \u201cis brimming with dynamism and intensity,\u201d Alex Rotter, Christie\u2019s chairman of post-war and contemporary art, said in a news release Monday.\n\nBoth Anthropom\u00e9trie works feature the artist\u2019s signature International Klein Blue (IKB) pigment, a deep yet bright blue. Klein orchestrated the models\u2019 movements across the canvases, inaugurating the series with a live performance. Christie\u2019s says ANT 113 is one of a subset \u201cin which the body appears to take flight.\u201d Other works in this subset include Princess Helena, which is at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and ANT 130 in Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany.\n\nThe painting is being offered from an anonymous private collection.
