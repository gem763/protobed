My commitment is fully here, and it will remain the same. About the future, long-term, I have no idea.\"\n\nThe deal between KTM and Tech3 supposes parity in terms of machinery, but Oliveira admitted he had his doubts that this would be fulfilled in 2020, saying: \"We were supposed to have a factory bike this year, it didn't happen until only recently, [so] who knows about next year?\"\n\nHe added: \"The thing is, when you are offered a factory seat, there are many other things at stake - first of all, you are guaranteed that you have a factory bike, secondly you are more involved in the development of the parts and you get to try many things.\n\n\"For me as a one year [of] experience MotoGP rider, [it] made more sense to be there, but it doesn't make [more sense] to them, and this is the thing where we disagree. But again, I respect that. There's nothing I can do.\"\n\nOliveira said he found out Binder's promotion was on the cards on Friday at Motegi.\n\n\"Mike [Leitner, KTM team manager] came and talked to me, and I explained how I felt about it, but it made no difference, so clearly they knew about it [the final decision], and they were just asking me my opinion to waste my time.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Miguel Oliveira says KTM's decision to hand rookie Brad Binder a factory MotoGP ride for 2020 makes sense \"only\" to KTM and has left him feeling \"not worthy\"", "authors": ["Valentin Khorounzhiy", "Oriol Puigdemont"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EMWjbh86ani7KZmvpBMi1Q--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/97dc5342e7dbd0afdc9bc738bc25f3a2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
