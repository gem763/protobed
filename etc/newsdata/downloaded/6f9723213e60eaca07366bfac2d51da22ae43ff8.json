There\u2019s really no such thing as a small nuclear war. Any wartime use of atomic weapons would be catastrophic, even civilization-ending.\n\nThe Science and Global Security team developed the simulation to depict what it described as \u201ca plausible escalating war between the United States and Russia using realistic nuclear force postures, targets and fatality estimates. It is estimated that there would be more than 90 million people dead and injured within the first few hours of the conflict.\u201d\n\nThe Princeton simulation relies in part on NUKEMAP, an on-line atomic-strike simulator that historian Alex Wellerstein developed. \u201cWe live in a world where nuclear weapons issues are on the front pages of our newspapers on a regular basis, yet most people still have a very bad sense of what an exploding nuclear weapon can actually do,\u201d Wellerstein explained.\n\n\u201cThis project is motivated by the need to highlight the potentially catastrophic consequences of current U.S. and Russian nuclear-war plans,\u201d the Princeton team stated.\n\n\u201cThe risk of nuclear war has increased dramatically in the past two years as the United States and Russia have abandoned long-standing nuclear arms control treaties, started to develop new kinds of nuclear weapons and expanded the circumstances in which they might use nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nAs part of the wider strategic escalation between the two countries, the United States under Pres. Donald Trump has moved to acquire new, smaller-yield nuclear weapons -- and has begun writing doctrine for employing them even in cases where the threat is non-nuclear.\n\nThis is a bad idea, Deverrick Holmes explained for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, D.C. \u201cEmbracing the concept of limited nuclear war is folly to the highest degree, and we fool ourselves if we think using low-yield nuclear weapons will somehow help halt the escalation to all-out destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already know this,\u201d Holmes added, \u201cwe have tested the proposition before.\u201d\n\nIn 1982, the Reagan administration organized a war game known as \u201cProud Prophet\u201d involving high-level defense officials. During the exercise, which played out over two weeks, the United States wanted to test the theory of limited nuclear strike. What they found was that the Soviet Union perceived even a low-yield nuclear strike as an attack, and responded with a massive missile salvo. \u201cThe result was a catastrophe,\u201d said Paul Bracken, a political scientist and Department of Defense advisor. \u201cA half-billion human beings were killed in the initial exchanges and at least that many more would have died from radiation and starvation. NATO was gone. So was a good part of Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union. Major parts of the Northern Hemisphere would be uninhabitable for decades.\u201d Post-Proud Prophet, the rhetoric and policies coming out of the Reagan administration shifted dramatically. Bracken writes, \u201cLaunch on warning, horizontal escalation, early use of nuclear weapons, tit-for-tat nuclear exchanges \u2014 these were banished conceptually and rhetorically.\u201d The exercise brought to light the inherent flaws of using nuclear weapons to maintain stability, and the Reagan administration stopped working to respond to nuclear escalation, instead focusing on reducing risks altogether.\n\nThe Reagan administration gazed upon the simulated horrors of simulated nuclear war and made an effort to change its policies in order to minimize the chance of any atomic exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the Trump administration will have a similar change of heart, even when confronted with a depiction of a \u201csmall\u201d nuclear war that kills 90 million people in a virtual instant.\n\nDavid Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.
