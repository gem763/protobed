I am a big believer in what he's set out to do for the country,\" Bernhardt said. \"And part of that is making the Department of the Interior work better in a number of ways ... and part of being able to do that is certainly having some folks who have the experience and know how to do it and expertise.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, I work for the president, and nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 I will ever do is going to deviate from his priorities, provided I have the lawful means to do it,\" Bernhardt said.\n\nBernhardt also said that he has \"spent a lot of time with ethics officials.\" His predecessor, Ryan Zinke, stepped down amid several ethics investigations.\n\nBernhardt also denied that his policies benefit the companies he used to represent as a lobbyist.\n\n\"I was not motivated in any particular matters where former employers were a party,\" he said.\n\nBernhardt also defended the decision to relocate Interior Department headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado. He denied that this move had anything to do with Republican Senator Cory Gardner's tough race for re-election in 2020.\n\n\"That is completely wrong,\" Bernhardt said about the allegations.\n\nFor more of Major's conversation with David Bernhardt, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on iTunes, GooglePlay, Spotify and Stitcher.
