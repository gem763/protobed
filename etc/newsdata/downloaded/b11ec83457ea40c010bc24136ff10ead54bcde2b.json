The illegal alien lived in a region of Iowa that was surrounded by sanctuary cities, as Breitbart News noted, and worked on a dairy farm using a stolen ID and Social Security card after allegedly crossing the U.S.-Mexico border as a child.\n\nThis week, Bahena Rivera\u2019s defense attorneys were able to successfully get the trial moved to February, telling the court that they needed additional time to gather expert witnesses for forensic evidence released this month, according to the Des Moines Register.\n\nThe attorneys said not granting another trial delay would be a violation of Bahena Rivera\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial. Now, the trial will begin February 4, 2020.\n\nAs Breitbart News has chronicled, Bahena Rivera has been able to win a series of battles in the court system, getting at least $22,000 worth of taxpayer-funded services like a full-time translator, previously securing a trial delay, and having his trial moved after he claimed that the county where the trial was set to be heard had a population that was too white and not Hispanic enough.\n\nMollie Tibbetts Murder Trial Moved to More Hispanic-Populated Iowa Countyhttps://t.co/KAQJfm0qgo \u2014 John Binder \ud83d\udc7d (@JxhnBinder) March 28, 2019\n\nBahena Rivera\u2019s attorneys have sought for months to suppress his alleged murder confession and have it thrown out of the case before the trial begins. The attorneys said Bahena Rivera\u2019s \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d were violated when police questioned him.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Bahena Rivera was the last person who saw Tibbetts jogging on the evening of July 18 in Brooklyn, Iowa. That is the night Tibbetts went missing.\n\nBahena Rivera, according to police, said Tibbetts was jogging when he saw her. That is when he said he approached Tibbetts and started talking to her. After Tibbetts told Bahena Rivera that she would call the police if he did not stop following her, the illegal alien allegedly chased her and says he \u201cblacked out\u201d after this.\n\nPolice believe Bahena Rivera stabbed Tibbetts to death, then drove to a cornfield where prosecutors say he placed cornstalks over her to hide her body. The illegal alien has been held on a $5 million bond.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
