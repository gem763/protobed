The Bronze Age find dates from between 800BC and 900BC\n\nCurator Kate Sumnall, from the Museum of London, said: 'This exceptional discovery came up. We can tell a lot about what life was like for Bronze Age people living in this part of London.\n\n'Hoarding is something we see a lot of in the late Bronze Age. We don't have all the answers. Our knowledge of the Bronze Age is quite fragmentary.\n\n'But every time we find something it gives us another piece in that jigsaw puzzle.\n\n'This may have been a store, for a metal worker, or some sort of offering to the gods perhaps. We don't know.\n\n'It may have been for recycling. Bronze can be melted down and recast almost an infinite number of times.'\n\nIt is well-known that Bronze Age societies made sacrifices to appease their gods.\n\nOfferings were made by either burying the sacrifice in the ground or placing it in water.\n\nMs Sumnall added: 'There are a lot of overlaps between what we know about the Bronze Age and today.\n\nExperts believe the site may have been an armoury vault, weapon shops or blacksmiths due to how carefully the items were grouped together\n\nThe treasure was found by archaeologists who were asked to look at a site being developed for gravel extraction\n\n'There was climate change, but that was part of a natural pattern, and so water levels were rising.\n\n'If settlements were adjacent to rivers, people may have had to move and the weapons could have been buried then.'\n\nAlmost all the objects appear to be partially broken or damaged and it is not known why they were not recovered.\n\nHistoric England chief executive Duncan Wilson said: 'This extraordinary discovery adds immensely to our understanding of Bronze Age life...\n\n'The opportunity to investigate here and ultimately unearth the remarkable hoards that have come to light was only possible because of the effective partnership between archaeologists and developers.'\n\nRoy Stephenson, London's historic environment lead at the Museum Of London, said: 'We're thrilled to be able to display this momentous discovery for the first time at the Museum Of London Docklands as the centrepiece of a major exhibition in April 2020.'\n\nThe museum has acquired the objects after they were declared treasure by the coroner.\n\nThe hoard will travel to the Havering Museum for display after going on show at the Museum Of London Docklands.", "description": "The treasure trove of 453 artefacts dating back nearly 3,000 years were discovered in Havering, east London, last September.
