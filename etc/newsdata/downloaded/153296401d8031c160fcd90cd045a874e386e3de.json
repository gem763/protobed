They added that he should have been aware of any shortages in supply.\n\nA 15-page official report - the result of a probe ordered by the government - has, however, said Dr Khan is not guilty of medical negligence. It also says he was not in-charge of the hospital ward where most of the deaths occurred.\n\nThe government is yet to respond to the findings of the report.\n\nIn August 2017, a video testimony by Dr Khan, which went viral in the days following the deaths, had contradicted the government's claim.\n\nIn it, he describes begging nearby hospitals for oxygen canisters after learning that his hospital's central supply had been exhausted.\n\n\"I brought 250 cylinders in 24 hours! 250! I don't know how many children lived or died but I did my level best,\" he said.\n\nDr Khan was suspended and later arrested, along with eight others. He spent seven months in jail, awaiting trial on charges of attempting to commit culpable homicide, a criminal breach of trust by a public servant and criminal conspiracy.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption It was widely reported that the deaths were caused by oxygen supply being cut over unpaid bills\n\nIn April 2018, the high court in Allahabad granted him bail, saying there was not enough evidence of negligence on his part.", "description": "Dr Kafeel Khan was blamed for the deaths of dozens of children in a public hospital in India.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B265/production/_108996654_gettyimages-984398758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
