Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nTo celebrate SpongeBob Squarepants turning 20 this year, Nickelodeon released a \u201cMasterpiece Memes\u201d vinyl figurine collection featuring the most beloved memes birthed from the show, including \u201cImaaagination SpongeBob\u201d and \u201cHandsome Squidward.\u201d The 8-inch figurines, retailing for around $20 each, immediately sold out when they were first released, speaking to the enduring popularity of the show and how closely it mirrors the internet\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cThe SpongeBob memes are a top seller. It\u2019s just that pop culture, that older audience,\u201d says Freddy Tutiven, Nickelodeon\u2019s creative director of toy design. Now Nickelodeon is working on the second wave of SpongeBob meme toys. Like the first wave, which memes are chosen will be determined by fan demand.\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of other shows that have a natural connection to memes to the degree that SpongeBob has, but the success of the line has given Nickelodeon some ideas for other meme collections. \u201cI think the next one, I might be talking too soon, but it might be Rugrats,\u201d Tutiven says.\n\nThroughout his 10 years at Nickelodeon, Tutiven has supervised the designs and development of thousands of toys, ones created both internally and through licensees. He also teaches toy design at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), a two-year BFA program that covers everything from traditional model making to technical engineering and product safety. Tutiven showed me around Nickelodeon\u2019s Consumer Products division where I got to see concept art, one-of-a-kind prototypes, and rare art toy collections.\n\nAn anatomical Patrick sculpture from artist Jason Freeny\u2019s Hidden Dissectibles line.\n\nHow does a toy become a collector\u2019s item? \u201cIt\u2019s all fan-based. A lot of pop culture artists, they gravitate to certain characters, and then they approach us, or we find them and say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019d be great to do a collaboration.\u2019\u201d\n\nInktober sketches from the design team. \u201cWe had a basket of words, where we just took out two words and then made new sketches out of that.\u201d\n\nA wall of concept art featuring other Viacom properties like Top Gun (which gets licensed to other toy companies like Funko), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Paw Patrol, as well as YouTube star JoJo Siwa. Siwa has an exclusive licensing deal with Nickelodeon and has sold 35 million bows alone since 2016. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about her, is that she does a lot of her own network. Anytime we make a product, she is a promoter of her own brand,\u201d Tutiven says.\n\nA traditional maquette of CatDog, which was first sculpted in clay, then created into a mold and completed with resin. Maquettes are used as \u201crough sketches,\u201d in a sense, to get a feel for what a toy will look like, as well as provide the manufacturing partners with a model to work off of. \u201cNow with technology, we don\u2019t send these anymore. We just send the rigs and the 3D files to our partners, but it\u2019s a great starting point.\u201d\n\nA maquette for a TMNT Krang figurine that never made it to production, for being too large and expensive.\n\nAn entire closet full of maquettes, featuring characters from shows like The Fairly Odd Parents, Dora the Explorer, and Rocket Power.\n\nStuffed plush toys are considerably harder to make than hard figurines, because they first have to be stitched by hand. \u201cThis helps us with the consistency of our brand characters,\u201d Tutiven says.

All students in the FIT toy design program have to take a sewing course.\n\nSpongebob-themed kitchen accessories: slow cookers, measuring cups, and a Krusty Krab ceramic butter dish, where the sign also doubles as a butter knife.\n\nPhotography by Dami Lee / The Verge", "description": "To celebrate SpongeBob Squarepants turning 20 this year, Nickelodeon released a \"Masterpiece Memes\" vinyl figurine collection featuring the most beloved memes birthed from the show, including \"Imaaagination SpongeBob\" and \"Handsome Squidward.\"", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LE5fWgrPXjqMxYXIf555LwLlvLc=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18314899/dlee_190716_3547_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
