Water views, palm trees, a gentle breeze -- it's the perfect way to start the day.\n\nSo when I heard about the possibility of running the world's only organized private island 5K -- complete with course clocks and finishing medals, not to mention the adrenaline rush of a formalized start and hundreds of other runners on the course -- I knew I would sign up.\n\nBut what intrigued me even more than the scenery along the way was who was behind this run that has been on my bucket list \u2014 Disney Cruise Line.\n\nCastaway Cay, Disney Cruise Line's private island, is the home of the Castaway 5K -- and it's one of the cruise line's most popular excursions.\n\n\"Guests get to come off the ship early, about 8:30 when there's practically no one on the island,\" Anthony England, assistant cruise director for Disney Cruise Line, told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"It's a great opportunity to get in a run or walk first thing and see some beautiful scenery you might not otherwise. They love that it gets them off the ship first thing.\"\n\nFull disclosure: As a marathon runner, I have run several 10Ks and half-marathons. But I hadn\u2019t run in about a year when it came time for the 5K on Castaway Cay. I found the course flat and easy but still took full advantage of the on-course water stations and photo ops that also served as mini breaks.\n\nOn the course, I chatted with a father-daughter duo running together. Reed and Avery, from Seattle, said they signed up because they thought it sounded like a unique opportunity.\n\n\"It's not every day you get to run a 5K on a private island,\" said Aver, who was running her first 5K. Reed told \"GMA\" he loved sharing the experience with his daughter.\n\n\"We're having a lot of fun,\" he said.\n\nFrom first-timers to long-timers, the course is designed to appeal to all fitness levels. And there's no need to run at all -- many people walk the course.\n\nSelf-described fitness enthusiast Jon Kuzava, from Denver, found out about the Castaway Cay 5K from a friend who had run it before.\n\n\"It was a fun trail back there,\" he told \"GMA\" at the finish line. \"People were high-fiving, there was music going. There's every different kind of person and fitness level.\"\n\nDisney Cruise Line has four ships in its fleet, with a fifth on the way. Every Caribbean and Bahamas cruise calls on Castaway Cay. That means that chances are if you're on a Disney cruise you'll have the chance to cross this run off your bucket list. Repeat guests often run the 5K again and again. Kuzava said he plans on becoming a repeat runner.\n\n\"I'm going to do this every time I come on the ship now,\" he said. \"The Castaway Cay 5K was the highlight for me.\"\n\nWhat to know:\n\n- There are clocks on the course, but it is not an individually timed race.\n\n- If you have kids, you can drop them off before the race at the on-island\u2019s kids\u2019 club, Scuttle's Cove.\n\n- Cruisers registered for the Castaway 5K get off the ship before everyone else, avoiding the crowds.\n\n- The finish medals change frequently, and runners collect them the way park-goers collect pins.\n\n- The race is free.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. is the parent company of ABC News.", "description": "Disney Cruise Line's private island is the home of the Castaway Cay 5K.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191002castawaycay5kmain_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
