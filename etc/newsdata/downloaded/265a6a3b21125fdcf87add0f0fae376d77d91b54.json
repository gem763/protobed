It employs a consensus model called delegated proof-of-stake.\n\nProtocol updates: smart contract efficiency and security\n\nAccording to Block.one\u2019s announcement, the core of EOSIO 2.0 includes various improvements to EOS VM \u2014 a high-performance WebAssembly engine specialized for blockchain applications that enables more efficient use of system resources when processing smart contracts.\n\nBlock.one claims that the updated EOS VM offers up to a 16x performance gain over EOSIO 1.0, thereby greatly improving smart contract efficiency.\n\nOther major developments include the adoption of WebAuthn authentication standards, allowing to use a hardware device for authenticating and signing transactions in browsers without extensions or extra installed software for EOSIO applications.\n\nThis will improve security without users needing to keep track of private keys or other account information, the press release claims.\n\nFor the network\u2019s block producers Block.one has also developed what it dubs \u201cweighted threshold multi-signature block production\u201d \u2014 a way for them to \u201csecurely sign blocks by utilizing a permission layer that allows for multiple block signing keys in a flexible scheme without sharing any sensitive data.\u201d\n\nNew developer tools\n\nThe release also includes a new web-based development tool dubbed EOSIO Quickstart Web IDE \u2014 currently at an alpha support stage \u2014 which aims to decrease the complexity and system requirements for building EOS.io applications.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 14, a hacker had allegedly stolen over $110,000 in cryptocurrency through an exploit of EOS gambling game EOSPlay.\n\nIndustry developers have subsequently contextualized the hacker\u2019s exploits amid a purportedly wider problem: an inexpensive technique that allegedly allows hackers to \u201ccongest\u201d the network \u2014 or put it into a low-efficiency mode \u2014 with just a few dollars worth of EOS.\n\nBlock.one executives have rejected this claim and contended that the network is operating correctly.", "description": "EOS developer Block.one announces the release of version 2.0 of the EOSIO open source protocol with improved smart contract processing and security", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjQwMTM0MGIzMmEyZjM3MTM4NmU2MjlkYTBkYzQwNzIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
