I've lived in this violent relationship for two years, and the final attack upon me by Shaka was the worst.'\n\nThe 24-year-old mother-of-one suffered a series of life-threatening injuries including multiple facial fractures and a collapsed lung at the hands of the sadistic 31-year-old. Williams was jailed for nine years and ten months after admitting grievous bodily harm\n\nThe 24-year-old said she has suffered from anxiety, depression and hair loss since the attack.\n\nShe still has to use a surgical bag to compensate for her lost bowel function.\n\nProsecutor Deborah Smithies told the court in the hours leading to the attack Ms Bashforth had enjoyed a night at home with friends and a neighbour.\n\nShe went to bed after the last of her guests left at around 12.30am, but was awoken at 3am by Williams, who had climbed up to the French windows of her first floor bedroom.\n\nMs Bashforth let Williams in as requested and he soon started an argument about a packet of tobacco he found at her flat because he did not believe it was hers.\n\nShe told him her neighbour had left the tobacco behind and Williams insisted that she call her neighbour immediately to confirm what she had told him.\n\nMs Smithies said: 'She declined and said, 'why would I do that in the middle of the night? We're not even together anymore'.\n\n'That's when he set about physically assaulting her over what must have been a significant period of time...he knocked her unconscious.\n\n'The next thing she remembers is waking up in great pain and wondering what on earth had happened to her.\n\n'Her first thought was that she must have been in some sort of car crash, so extensive were her injuries.'\n\nThe next day Williams persistently phoned a mutual friend and told her she needed to take Ms Bashforth, who is also from Sheffield, to hospital.\n\nHe did not tell the woman what had happened or how badly her friend was injured.\n\nDue to work commitments the friend did not arrive at Ms Bashforth's flat until 3.30pm, more than 12 hours after the attack, by which time she was barely breathing.\n\nJudge Reeds QC said: 'She suffered such extensive bruising that when you eventually did raise the alarm and a friend found her, she was barely able to breathe.\n\n'Her friend describes the horror in seeing the state in which you left her.'\n\nHe added: 'You are a physically powerful man.\n\n'She could never hope to defend herself from you and you must have been in a state of rage to do that to her, and then, almost as bad leave her for dead without giving any thought about getting immediate help for what you had done to her.\n\n'You went home, and no doubt went to sleep, not caring to do anything to raise the alarm until much later.'\n\nSean Sullivan, defending Williams, said his client had inflicted Ms Bashforth's injuries with a 'flurry of hard punches'.\n\nThis was questioned by Judge Reeds QC, who said he found it 'very difficult' to believe that Williams had inflicted all of the injuries with his fists.\n\n'The extent of the bruising to the body, the limbs and the genital area is not that which generally would be associated with simply punching a person, whatever the circumstances,' Judge Reeds said.\n\nHe said the evidence suggested Williams had used his feet to inflict at least some of the injuries.\n\nIn addition to jailing Williams, Judge Reeds QC also granted a restraining order which prohibits him from contacting Ms Bashforth indefinitely.\n\nHe said: 'This was self-evidently a sustained attack in order to cause such extensive injuries.\n\n'You are very fortunate that she did not die or you would now be starting a life sentence for murder.'", "description": "Shaka Williams carried out the horrific beating at the home of his former partner Britney Bashforth on April 13 this year.
