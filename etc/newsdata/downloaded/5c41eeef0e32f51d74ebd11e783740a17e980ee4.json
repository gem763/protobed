Murphy was set to speak at the Palmerston library branch at 6:45 p.m. ET.\n\nMurphy has argued that \"allowing men to identify as women\" undermines women's rights, and that transgender women should not be allowed in women's spaces.\n\nHer appearance has been widely condemned by authors, politicians and members of the city's LGBTQ community.\n\nBut the library has defended its decision to allow the event, saying it has an obligation to protect free speech and that Murphy's appearance does not violate TPL's policy on renting space for community events.\n\n\"Megan Murphy has never been charged with or convicted of hate speech as defined in the Criminal Code of Canada,\" the library said in a statement.\n\nMayor John Tory has said he was \"disappointed\" in the library's refusal to cancel the event.\n\nAn online petition that has garnered more than 8,000 signatures claims the library is providing space to hate speech.\n\n\"Offering Murphy a platform means denying the resources and promise of safe and equitable space to trans communities,\" the petition reads.\n\nPolice spokesman Const. Victor Kwong says officers will be inside and outside the event in order to \"keep the peace.\"", "description": "Hundreds protested outside a Toronto library on Tuesday evening ahead of an appearance by a controversial speaker who has sparked tensions with the city's LGBTQ community.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340382.1572390220!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/protest-at-toronto-public-library-event.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
