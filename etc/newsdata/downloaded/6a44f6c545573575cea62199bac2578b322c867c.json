China Sea map", "language": "en", "text": "HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 Vietnam has pulled the Hollywood animation movie \u201cAbominable\u201d from theaters for featuring a scene with a map containing the controversial South China Sea nine-dash line, state media reported.\n\nThe dash line, which is used by China to mark its claim to the entire South China Sea, has been a subject of condemnation by Vietnam and others with claims to the sea, which is crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\n\u201cAbominable,\u201d the story of a Chinese girl who helps a yeti get back to its home on Mount Everest, was produced by a collaboration between DreamWorks Animation and China-based Pearl Studio.\n\nIt was shown in Vietnamese cinemas for a week before its removal, the state-owned Tuoi Tre newspaper reported Monday.\n\n\u201cWe will be more alert and more vigorous in censorship,\u201d the head of the government\u2019s cinema department, Nguyen Thu Ha, was quoted as saying.\n\nThe department is responsible for the censorship of all movies for violence, sex and unfavorable political messages in authoritarian Vietnam.\n\nTrailers and other associated information for \u201cAbominable\u201d have been removed from the Vietnamese distributors\u2019 website and social media channels. The movie\u2019s trailer and posters were removed from advertising screens in theaters.\n\nThe film was also met with criticism from Vietnamese movie fans.\n\n\u201cIt is an insult to Vietnam,\u201d said student Minh Hieu, who was looking for a movie to watch on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAnother student, Nguyen Mai Huong, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t watch it even if it still showed in the cinema. The (nine-dash) map is straight-up wrong. And I am absolutely not going to support it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vietnam has pulled the Hollywood animation movie \"Abominable\" from theaters for featuring a scene with a map containing the controversial South China Sea nine-dash line, state media reported.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/film_review_-_abominable_75472_c296-0-5000-2744_s1200x700.jpg?bcc4b77c57e3560c666a17ad8b1c2b7d16c26653", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
