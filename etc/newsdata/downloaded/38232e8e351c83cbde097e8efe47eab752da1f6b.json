Analysts have projected WeWork would burn through several billion dollars over the next few years and thus would need to keep on raising fresh funds at favourable valuations.\n\nWeWork co-founder Adam Neumann has exited the building as CEO. AP\n\nAccording to two sources familiar with the matter, the company was looking to trim its workforce and slow its expansion so as to burn through less cash and be less dependent on fresh funding.\n\nThe company was in talks to raise fresh funding from investors, including SoftBank Corp, the sources added.\n\nSoftBank, which had been pushing WeWork to postpone its IPO and is attempting to raise its second $US100 billion-plus Vision Fund, is under pressure to assuage key backers of the investment fund who have raised concerns over its long-term viability.\n\nThe decision to withdraw the IPO was no surprise, however. It was widely expected after the company postponed the share sale last month, after push-back from prospective stockmarket investors over its widening losses and Mr Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.\n\n\"We have decided to postpone our IPO to focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong,\" WeWork's new co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham said on Monday (Tuesday AEST).\n\n\"We have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future,\" they added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoftBank, which owns almost a third of We Company, invested in the start-up at a $US47 billion valuation in January. But last month investor skepticism led to its considering a potential IPO valuation of as low as $US10 billion, Reuters reported.\n\nWe Company had vowed to pursue the IPO and complete the share sale by the end of the year after Mr Neumann stepped down as CEO. However, sources told Reuters last week that the IPO was unlikely to be completed this year.\n\nWeWork's doomed IPO marks a rough period for start-ups going public in recent weeks. Last week, US entertainment and talent agency company Endeavor Group Holdings pulled its IPO, while shares of Peloton Interactive, the fitness start-up known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, slid as much as 7 per cent in their market debut.\n\nEarlier last month, teeth alignment firm SmileDirectClub opened to an underwhelming debut.\n\nRide-hailing companies Uber Technologies and Lyft also went public this year with high expectations, but their shares since have tumbled after investor concerns about their steep losses.\n\nReuters", "description": "The parent company's moves pave the way for a financial turnaround out of the spotlight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4684%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_242%2C$y_653/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8a3c575974e48409683c9553933702c74d42cf58", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
