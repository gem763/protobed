The current auction record for the Bristol-born artist is 1.4 million euros for \"Keep it Spotless.\"\n\nThe \"Girl With Balloon\" painting famously self-destructed moments after it was auctioned off, shredding it into pieces.\n\n\"Devolved Parliament\" was previously on display at the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery on March 29, the original day the U.K. was meant to leave the EU.\n\nBanksy commented on the museum\u2019s decision to put the piece up, writing on Instagram, \"I made this ten years ago. Bristol museum have just put it back on display to mark Brexit day. \u2018Laugh now, but one day no-one will be in charge.\u2019\"\n\nThe chimpanzee art will be on display at Sotheby\u2019s from Sept. 28 to Oct. 3 and put up for auction the evening of Oct. 3 at the art dealer company\u2019s Contemporary Art Evening Auction.", "description": "The Banksy painting depicting members of UK Parliament as chimpanzees will go up for auction.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/banksy-painting-ap-jt-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
