The UMWA\u2019s pension plan is on track to become insolvent within just a few years, and Congress has done nothing so far to make sure miners don\u2019t end up with pennies on the dollar.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking about us needing a \u2018transition\u2019\u2026 Well, our transition has unfortunately been at the bankruptcy court,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNobody cares about this. Let\u2019s be honest.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 speech, delivered the same day a climate town hall for presidential hopefuls would be broadcast on CNN, underscored one of the major hurdles progressive Democrats face in enacting some form of a Green New Deal to dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. The proposal calls for a sweeping industrial plan to rapidly shift away from fossil fuels, plant billions of trees and rebuild infrastructure to withstand a hotter, less predictable world.\n\nThere are different versions of such a plan, though all promise to create good-paying jobs and look after workers in industries hurt in the transition. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), one of the most vocal proponents of a Green New Deal, has spoken often about how a climate package should fully fund the miners\u2019 endangered pension plan. Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has a plan that includes $15 billion for the Black Lung Disability Fund and a guaranteed five years of salary, health care and pension support for workers displaced by the move to renewable energy.\n\nSeveral other contenders for the 2020 Democratic nomination proposed federal programs modeled on the GI Bill to help coal miners train for new lines of work.\n\nWhile Roberts said he\u2019s appreciated the dialogue his union has had with Ocasio-Cortez and others, he made clear he doesn\u2019t buy that a Green New Deal would produce union jobs on par with the disappearing coal jobs. He mocked the very idea, noting how badly unions have struggled to successfully organize workplaces. The union membership rate is just 6.4 percent in the private sector nationally. So few jobs in the booming solar industry are unionized that the nonprofit Solar Foundation stopped tracking them in its annual census report three years ago.\n\nI don\u2019t think a good starting point for Democrats is to eliminate union jobs. UMWA President Cecil Roberts\n\n\u201cI understand somehow, magically, if certain people get elected president, they\u2019re going to make those union jobs, and they\u2019re going to require them to pay what you get make now,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. I just can\u2019t make that work in my mind.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Green New Deal picked up two major labor endorsements, from the Service Employees International Union and the Association of Flight Attendants, which is part of the Communications Workers of America union. The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America followed suit last month. But powerful construction unions that rely on the fossil fuel industry for lucrative jobs, such as the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, remained firmly opposed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about not just eliminating coal miners\u2019 jobs... it would also cost building trade jobs that they have now, utility worker jobs,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a good starting point for Democrats is to eliminate union jobs. It seems to me what Democrats need is a lot more union members, as opposed to fewer.\u201d\n\nRoberts made clear that he believes in climate change \u2015 \u201cit\u2019s real, it needs to be dealt with\u201d \u2015 but argued that further curbing coal use in the U.S. would do little when coal-fired power plants continue to open in other countries.\n\nRoberts\u2019 speech came at a time when politicians and the media appear to be paying more attention than usual to coal miners. President Donald Trump made them a central theme of his 2016 election, holding rallies with \u201cTrump Digs Coal\u201d signs. News outlets have been sending reporters to Appalachia to see how the president\u2019s coal promises are playing out, and a road blockade staged by unpaid miners in Kentucky has made front-page news. The Sanders campaign sent pizza to the miners last month.\n\nBut Roberts said political concerns for miners often turn out to be hollow. He noted that it\u2019s been nearly 10 years since the Upper Big Branch mining disaster killed 29 miners in West Virginia, and despite promises at the time, Congress still has not reformed mine safety laws.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to get their pictures taken with a coal miner [when they\u2019re] running for office,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want anything to do with us once they get into office.\u201d\n\nRoberts had criticism for Trump, too. The president has often claimed, falsely, that the coal sector is being rejuvenated under his watch. But in reality, coal consumption is at its lowest level in decades, despite the administration\u2019s efforts to deregulate the industry. Coal-fired power plants continue to close not because of emissions rules, but because of cheap natural gas.\n\nEmployment in the coal industry is hovering around just 52,000, up just a little bit more than a thousand from when Trump took office in 2017.\n\n\u201cCoal is not back,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nRoberts asked that the president, who claims to be a friend of coal miners, do them a favor on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf he just tweeted \u2015 just make us 15 seconds of his day \u2015 that he felt that coal miners entitled to pensions should have [them], I think that might be enough,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019m pleading with him to do that.\u201d", "description": "The union's president said climate change is real, but thinks coal miners won't be taken care of in progressives' effort to address it.", "authors": ["Labor Reporter", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7021aa250000ad0003b562.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
