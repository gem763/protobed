Referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the centre circle while the big screen read 'No Goal' and Watford's fans celebrated, but a first win of the season slipped through their fingers.\n\nDele Alli's equaliser was a fitting end to another puzzling chapter in this baffling Tottenham season as the incorrect outcome was mistakenly relayed to the big screen. For Spurs' creaking backline, though, it capped an afternoon of relative calm.\n\nHaving conceded 10 goals in their two previous games, this was progress of sorts. The tide stemmed, if not yet turned.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's Tottenham side were frustrated by Watford in Saturday's draw\n\nFor the first time in the league this season, Mauricio Pochettino fielded a back three, with Davinson Sanchez between Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.\n\nThe thinking, Alderweireld explained, was to outnumber Watford's front two. It seemed an unnecessary failsafe against a side who had scored four goals all season. But given their charitable displays in recent weeks, what is too cautious?\n\nAfter only five minutes, a long ball flew over Danny Rose to Daryl Janmaat, who picked out Abdoulaye Doucoure to sweep home.\n\nShortly before the break, Vertonghen was lucky not to concede a penalty after a needless slide tackle on Gerard Deulofeu.\n\nAt half-time, Sanchez was hooked, the experiment shelved.\n\nStill, Janmaat fluffed a good chance to make it 2-0 before Alli's late goal rescued Spurs.\n\nFrom home games against Southampton and Watford and a trip to Brighton, Spurs have been fortunate to come away with four points. That they remain in touching distance of the top four is a mark of how low the bar is being set among the best of the rest.\n\nUnfortunately greater hurdles are on the horizon and Saturday suggested more pain awaits.\n\nSpurs face trips to Liverpool and Everton after a must-win Champions League clash at home to Red Star Belgrade.\n\nDele Alli's equaliser was a fitting end to another puzzling chapter in Tottenham's season\n\n'You can see it two ways. It's a big opportunity for us,' Alderweireld said. 'Tuesday, we have to use that. Then Sunday is a big opportunity.'\n\nOn the visit of Red Star, he added: 'We need to win, especially at home. But I'm confident as well. Those type of games can change a season.'\n\nAfter Saturday's setback, the rallying cry was issued: 'We need to improve\u2026 we have to get out of this,' said Alderweireld.\n\nHow they do that isn't quite clear. There are issues across the pitch but it's at the back where cracks are widening.\n\nIn each of Alderweireld's first three seasons in London, Spurs conceded fewer than one goal a game. No defence was more difficult to breach than theirs in both 2015-16 and 2016-17.\n\nWith him and Vertonghen at its heart, Spurs' defence was once the envy of the league. No more. The rot began to set in last season and they have now shipped 13 goals in nine Premier League games, and nine in their first two European matches.\n\nToby Alderweireld insists Tottenham need to beat Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League\n\nIt's no coincidence that as Vertonghen and Alderweireld struggle, the team's fortunes have dipped. Both are the wrong side of 30 and in the final year of their contract. Sanchez, meanwhile, has struggled and Juan Foyth has suffered injuries.\n\nAround them, the other foundations on which Pochettino built are crumbling, too. Mousa Dembele has never been replaced and Spurs' full backs, once the beating heart of this team, are now a problem area. Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier have been sold, Serge Aurier looks short of the standard required and Danny Rose is struggling.\n\nAnd what of the intensity that fuelled their devastating work with and without the ball in recent years? On Saturday Spurs were ponderous and predictable.\n\nBut Alderweireld praised their 'fighting spirit' and called on fans to stick with the team. Their patience is being tested. This could be a turning point in Spurs' season. But there's every chance this is when campaigns at home and abroad begin to really unravel.", "description": "For a few seconds in north London, time stood still and anarchy reigned.
