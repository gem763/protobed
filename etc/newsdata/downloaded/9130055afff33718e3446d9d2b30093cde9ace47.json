I must have been around seven. It was fast and in retrospect very stylish, with a flatbar and white tyres. Those didn\u2019t last too long from all the skidding, though.\n\nHow many bikes and how do you know when you have too many?\n\nThree for myself; a Riese & M\u00fcller e-bike commuter, a Merida Scultura Team road bike for the weekends, and a Merida CX I keep in the Netherlands for when I\u2019m visiting. I quite often ride our demo e-bikes, too. When you spend more time cleaning than riding, you have too many bikes.\n\nHow much did they cost?\n\nThe e-bike cost $11,000, the road bike $8000 and the CX $2000.\n\nWhat's your dream bike and equipment?\n\nWhenever I see a nice bike on the road I might say \u201cWow, that\u2019d be cool to have\u201d, but it never really changes how I feel about the bikes I actually own.\n\nE-bikes are the ideal form of daily transport, says Thijs van der Heijden.\n\nWhat kind of riding do you do?\n\nI ride the e-bike pretty much anywhere for daily transport, it\u2019s such an amazing tool. Being reasonably fit, I was initially sceptical about the benefits for myself. That changed one summer night when it was above 30 degrees. I had to go to a dinner party at the top of a hill in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs, a 15-kilometre ride. There was no way I could have ridden my regular bike there and arrive presentable at the other end. But with the e-bike, I could ride there in my work clothes. I sold my old hybrid and have never looked back. The road bike is for weekend riding with a small group.\n\nAny tips to become a better rider?\n\nFirst, just get out there more often. Second, get some technical skills coaching to make you more efficient.\n\nHow many kilometres a week do you ride?\n\nAbout 150 to 200 a week all up.\n\nHills or the flat?\n\nRolling hills or short, not too steep, power climbs... The big mountains are fun, but I have to be fit to enjoy them.", "description": "A collision with a mountain has not deterred e-bike leasing company founder Thijs van der Heijden from riding whenever he can.
