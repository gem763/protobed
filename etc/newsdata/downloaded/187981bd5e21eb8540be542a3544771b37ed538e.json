No matter their genre of choice (and he loves them all), they\u2019re uninhibited orgies of cinematic pleasures, and that\u2019s again true of the prolific 59-year-old Japanese master\u2019s latest, First Love. Even if you\u2019ve seen a million gangster sagas, you\u2019ve never experienced one quite like this.\n\nHaving now exceeded, as a director, the 100-movie mark (a feat accomplished with 2017\u2019s awesome samurai bloodbath Blade of the Immortal), Miike returns to Yakuza business with First Love (in theaters Sept. 27), whose relatively patient and meticulous introductory passages are mere set-up for the ensuing raft of head-spinning punchlines. Initially, those blows are quite literal, doled out by Leo (Masataka Kubota), a young Tokyo pugilist whose demeanor is placid whether he\u2019s training by himself (his earphones his only companion), sparring with a partner, or throwing jabs and hooks in the ring opposite opponents. Leo is even undemonstrative in victory, such that his trainer chastises him for his sullen reserve, suggesting he let out a triumphant yell upon winning a bout.\n\nOvert displays of emotion, though, aren\u2019t really Leo\u2019s thing, no matter the circumstances\u2014including after he mysteriously falls down during a fight and subsequently receives news that he has a fatal brain tumor. With no family to speak of (his parents abandoned him on a doorstep as an infant), Leo wanders the city at night, content to spend his final days alone. Yet fate\u2014or Miike, if you like\u2014has other plans for him. Following an impromptu visit to a fortune teller who opines that Leo is destined for a long life and should thus learn to fight not for himself but for others, he gets the chance to do just that when a young woman named Monica (Sakurako Konishi) bumps into him while fleeing an older man and screaming for help. His protective instincts kicking in, Leo knocks the pursuing fellow out, thus instigating a relationship with the harried beauty.\n\nLest that make it sound like First Love is a straightforward affair, this encounter occurs only once we\u2019ve already been introduced to Monica, whose father has sold her into prostitution-slavery to the Yakuza in order to pay off his debts. Monica is a junkie, using drugs to stifle her recurring visions of a young boy from her past, and her father draped in a sheet like a specter. It\u2019s this ghost that Monica is running away from when she collides with Leo. The man chasing her is her date, police officer Otomo (Nao Omori), who\u2019s teamed up with a scheming mid-level Yakuza henchman named Kase (Sh\u00f4ta Sometani) to steal and sell his crew\u2019s drugs, and to then pin the heist on Monica and a rival Chinese gang run by one-armed bigwig Wang (Cheng-Kuo Yen), who wants revenge against Kase\u2019s boss Gondo (Seiy\u00f4 Uchino) for severing his appendage during a prior skirmish.\n\nGot that? First Love slowly accelerates as these pieces move into place, along the way introducing a raft of other characters\u2014on both sides of the brewing Japanese-Chinese turf war\u2014destined to play a part in the ensuing mayhem. Most crucial of all, at least initially, is Julie (Becky Rabone), whose boyfriend (Monica\u2019s pimp) is in possession of the drugs Kase and Otomo covet. Once things go south, Julie embarks on her own vengeful rampage\u2014or, at least, she does so following her escape from an apartment set on fire by Kase, who before booby-trapping it to explode discovers that Julie has a roommate\u2014her grandmother!\u2014and promptly cold-cocks her in the face.\n\n\u201c Miike generates droll humor from splattery showdowns involving a slew of interrelated characters, many of whom, it must be said, have the unfortunate habit of losing their heads under pressure. \u201d\n\nBrash, arrogant and nonchalant about the horrors he\u2019s perpetrating, Kase is a routine scene-stealer, and his exaggerated reactions to extreme situations\u2014including being shot in the gut and then having Monica sniff meth off his crotch\u2014occasionally recall those of Stranger Things\u2019 Joe Keery. Not that he\u2019s the only one responsible for First Love\u2019s wacky energy. A sequence in which Monica tries to use music to distract herself from the appearance of her father\u2019s spirit while on a subway train, only to cause the tighty-whities-wearing ghost to start awkwardly boogying before her eyes in the well-populated car, is as absurdly surreal as they come. And as is his penchant, Miike generates droll humor from splattery showdowns involving a slew of interrelated characters, many of whom, it must be said, have the unfortunate habit of losing their heads under pressure.\n\nBeneath First Love\u2019s over-the-top surface lurk messages about the preciousness of time, the strength that comes from selflessness, and the importance of setting the past aside in order to focus on the future. Those notions, however, are often deliberately hard to spy amidst the gonzo carnage orchestrated by the director. Working from a playful Masa Nakamura script that hopelessly entangles its myriad players\u2014in large part over the course of one long, eventful, decapitation-heavy night\u2014Miike eventually hits a breakneck stride that\u2019s exhilarating. His various points of focus crisscross and converge crazily, until it becomes clear that only a considerable amount of bloodletting (and, maybe, some out-of-left-field anim\u00e9) will rectify this knotty situation.\n\nFirst Love eventually delivers on its pulpy promises, but what\u2019s so entertaining about the film is that its gratuitousness is played as a self-conscious joke. Miike recognizes that everyone involved in this tall tale of murder, misery and romance\u2014from doomed boxer Leo and traumatized damsel in distress Monica, to cocksure Kase and corrupt Otomo\u2014is a transparent riff on a cinematic archetype. Rather than trying to imbue them with unique depth, he opts instead to spin them around in circles until they don\u2019t know which way they\u2019re headed and we\u2019re delightfully dizzy from the sheer bravado of the filmmaking on display.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a delirious showcase for its creator\u2019s razzle-dazzle formal skills, with Miike cleverly juggling all manner of plot strands, interpersonal relationships, emotional crises, and wild tonal shifts. The director may not have much more on his mind than showing off on familiar turf, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that his scintillating stewardship makes First Love a vibrant, adrenalized new addition to his ever-burgeoning oeuvre.", "description": "The latest from Japanese auteur Takashi Miike is this ultraviolent Yakuza saga with a twist.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569574354/190925-schager-first-love-tease_ie7w9q", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
