It is for that reason that the Taxi Recapitalisation Programme remains the flagship of successive ANC administrations and a demonstration of our commitment to uplifting the taxi industry.\"\n\nMeet safety standards\n\nMbalula said the main aim of the programme was to ensure that vehicles used to ferry commuters met safety standards.\n\n\"In enabling the effective phasing out of unsafe vehicles and enabling introduction of those that meet the safety standards, government provides a capital subsidy in the form of a scrapping allowance.\n\n\"This allowance is only accessed by those who voluntarily surrender their vehicles that meet a pre-defined criteria to be scrapped. After a break of one year, we are pleased to announce the resumption of the scrapping of old taxi vehicles,\" he said.\n\nThe department has appointed Anthus Service 84, through a competitive bidding process, to provide operational management of the scrapping process and establish scrapping sites in all provinces.\n\n\"In repackaging the scrapping administration, we have ensured that the taxi industry directly benefits from this process. The administration of this process will be undertaken through a special purpose vehicle, a company to be jointly owned by Anthus Service 84 and the taxi industry.\n\n\"The taxi industry will own 60% of this new entity and the proceeds derived from the project will be channelled to a Taxi Development Trust,\" said Mbalula.\n\nHe said the department was currently in negotiations with the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) on the institutional arrangements that would ensure that every operator in the industry was able to benefit.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
