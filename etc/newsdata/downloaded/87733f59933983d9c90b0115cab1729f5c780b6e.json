This is, of course, with historical experience to back our sentiment in this regard,\" the members said.\n\nREAD MORE: Ekurhuleni mayor Masina slams 'phenomenon of incumbents persecuting former leaders'\n\nThey said the same task team failed to take them to conference last year.\n\n\"Nothing will be different now and, other things considered, they are likely to be worse since some of them are serving as members of the national executive and Cabinet in government. Worse off, the ANC leadership returns the eldership of Maine and Nzuza to preside over a process that spectacularly defeated them when they were still carrying a constitutional mandate.\n\n\"This approach to the task team is politically unwise and leaves us with the impression that the ANC leadership does not take the congress youth league seriously. We therefore reject this [task team] of seniorship as a misguided intervention. We will announce our course of action in due course.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
