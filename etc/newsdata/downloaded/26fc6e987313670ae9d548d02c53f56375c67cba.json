Boeing began working on a software fix to prevent MCAS from inadvertently activating, and disseminated the procedure to deactivate the software in an emergency.\n\nOn the morning of March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 took off from Addis Ababa. Pilots reported flight-control problems within a minute of leaving the runway. They disabled the electrical trim tab system, but were unable to manually turn the wheel that would change the trim by hand, partly because they had inadvertently left the engines on full thrust from takeoff.\n\nAfter six minutes, it slammed into the ground, killing all 146 aboard. MCAS was again cited as a contributing cause, combined with the fact that pilots could not adjust the stabilizer trim by hand.\n\nThe same day of the crash, Ethiopian Airlines grounded the rest of its 737 Max aircraft. A day later, the Chinese aviation authority \u2014 the Civil Aviation Administration of China, or CAAC \u2014 ordered the country's airlines to stop flying the plane.\n\nRegulators around the world followed, parking their 737 Max planes on March 11 and 12. The FAA was a lone holdout, initially insisting that the plane was airworthy. However, the agency followed its international counterparts and ordered the plane grounded on March 13.\n\nThe planes have remained grounded since, as Boeing has worked to complete a software redesign and improve recovery procedures from errant flight system activations.\n\nAfter the second crash, Boeing said that it was working on a software fix, which it expected to distribute within a few weeks. The FAA had said it expected the software to be approved by the end of March, but it announced a delay in early April, saying that it anticipated receiving \"Boeing's final package of its software enhancement over the coming weeks for FAA approval.\"\n\nHowever, that delay stretched on as Boeing and the FAA continued to scrutinize the plane. Eventually, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said during a July conference call with investors and analysts that the plane maker expected to submit the final fix to the FAA in September and fly the necessary certification flights, with approval coming in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nIt is not clear whether Boeing met its self-imposed September submission deadline, although it has maintained that it expects the plane to be recertified \u2014 at least in the US \u2014 by the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nUS airlines have all pulled the jet from their schedules until at least early 2020. Even if the plane is recertified in 2019, it will likely take airlines longer to install the software and prepare stored planes to fly again.\n\nThe FAA said that it would \"follow a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the aircraft to passenger service.\"", "description": "The crash of Lion Air flight 610 killed 189 people, and occurred five months before the jet was grounded globally following a second crash.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db4b28cdee0191fe871fa42?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
