This can result in higher emergency room rates across the board.\n\nDetails: A Yale study last year, analyzing data from a large insurer, found that when one of the two largest ER staffing firms, EmCare, entered a hospital, total payments to the insurer increased by 122%.\n\nThe second firm, TeamHealth, used the threat of leaving a network to get 68% higher in-network rates. Overall, ER doctors' in-network rates were 266% of what Medicare pays, which is higher than most other specialists.\n\nThese higher-than-average rates are \"not an insignificant part of health system costs, and thus [increase] premiums,\" said Loren Adler of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.\n\nHospitals can also benefit. \"If these docs want to bill [out-of-network], they have to compensate the hospital for the reputational cost of allowing surprise billing at their facility,\" Adler said.\n\nFor example, after EmCare entered a hospital, facility payments increased by 11%, the Yale study found.\n\nYes, but: \u201cThis is a specific niche of providers who have found this unethical, narrow wedge in the system where they can make significant amounts of money off the backs of patients,\" said Yale's Zach Cooper, an author of the study.\n\n\u2014 Bob Herman contributed to this report.", "description": "Some doctors and hospitals make a profit off of surprise billing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/1kGEenCcsIgEmC2U3pu1uFIKSYM=/0x63:2128x1260/1920x1080/2019/01/28/1548634646443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-28"}
