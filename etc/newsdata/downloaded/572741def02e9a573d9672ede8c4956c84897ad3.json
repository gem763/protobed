The judgment comes one week after the same court ruled that Google does not have to apply its \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d law globally, receiving praise from free-speech advocates for the decision.\n\nThe Court said in a statement: \u201cEU law does not preclude a host provider like Facebook from being ordered to remove identical and, in certain circumstances, equivalent comments previously declared to be illegal. In addition, EU law does not preclude such an injunction from producing effects worldwide, within the framework of the relevant international law.\u201d\n\nFacebook stated that it was not the role of social media firms to determine what content posted to its platform may be illegal in certain countries. The firm said in a statement:\n\nIt undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country. It also opens the door to obligations being imposed on internet companies to proactively monitor content and then interpret if it is \u2018equivalent\u2019 to content that has been found to be illegal. In order to get this right national courts will have to set out very clear definitions on what \u2018identical\u2019 and \u2018equivalent\u2019 means in practice. We hope the courts take a proportionate and measured approach, to avoid having a chilling effect on freedom of expression.\n\nThe U.K. rights group Article 19 backed up Facebook\u2019s statement, claiming that the ruling could lead to social media platforms using automated filters to deleted content. Executive Director of Article 19, Thomas Hughes, said in a statement: \u201cThis would set a dangerous precedent where the courts of one country can control what internet users in another country can see. This could be open to abuse, particularly by regimes with weak human rights records.\u201d\n\nThe court clarified that the ruling is limited to court orders and does not apply to wider complaints from users alleging that certain content is illegal.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
