But recently, it has taken actions that made some shareholders feel downright ill.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company has been at loggerheads for several months with group of shareholders representing 11.7% of the outstanding stock including Velan Capital, which has criticized Progenics for its failure to get drugs approved and poor share-price performance (the stock has fallen 14% since CEO Mark Baker took the helm in 2011). At the annual meeting in July, it became clear that many other shareholders were fed up: Two directors, Peter J. Crowley and Michael D. Kishbauch, each received just 35% support from shareholders and tendered their resignations. Mr. Baker narrowly squeaked by with 56% support, even without Velan campaigning shareholders to vote against him.\n\nSince then, Velan has launched a so-called consent solicitation to hold a meeting where it will propose replacements for five of the seven member board. The nominees have strong backgrounds in pharmaceutical commercialization, shareholder engagement and financial analysis. All five have served as board directors at public companies.\n\nBut before a shareholder meeting could happen, something extraordinary occurred: In early October, the board of directors, including Messrs. Crowley and Kishbauch, approved a deal to sell the company to Lantheus Holdings, Inc., another pharmaceutical company specializing in cancer treatments. The two directors, despite their resignations, still technically held their seats, so were able to vote.\n\nOne corporate governance expert said the decision for two outgoing directors to vote on such a serious matter is concerning. \u201cIt was legal but that doesn\u2019t make it the correct approach. I would consider it bad form,\u201d said Professor Charles Elson, Director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cUsually directors will leave immediately when they resign. You shouldn\u2019t have them making big decisions for the same reason lame duck politicians leave those to their incoming replacements.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the deal has a termination fee of $18 million \u2013 a significant amount for a company this size \u2013 that would be payable if Progenics were to back out of the deal.\n\n\u201cThe outgoing directors were told to leave by shareholders, then approved a deal with a significant termination fee, effectively locking it in,\u201d Mr. Elson said. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling.\u201d\n\nOther corporate governance experts, including those who often discourage shareholder activism, have said that directors who are voted out in uncontested contest elections should step aside after shareholders tell them to do so. Martin Lipton, Founding Partner of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, told CorpGov in a recent interview that votes against directors in such elections need to have \u201cteeth.\u201d\n\nEven if the deal had been made with a more orthodox director vote, it still looks problematic. While the all-stock offer appeared to be at a 21.5% premium, Progenics shares have hardly budged since the announcement, likely in part because Lantheus shares have fallen dramatically.\n\nAnalysts at Brookline Capital Partners panned the deal. \u201cLantheus management has indicated that it expects the deal to lead to $15-$20M in run-rate cost savings by 2022,\u201d Brookline wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWhile we agree that the deal makes strategic rationale and provides cost synergies, we believe that the deal does not unlock value for Progenics shareholders, undervalues the company and does not reflect the potential of the pipeline. We believe that it would be more prudent for company to stay independent and pursue changes with a new board and management to create value for shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe synergies from any merger are indeed significant. Assuming $20 million of cost savings, put on a multiple of 10 times and taxed at 25%, they\u2019re worth $150 million. Net operating losses could easily send the total synergies\u2019 value north of $200 million \u2013 a chunky figure considering Lantheus is expected to generate $106 million of Ebitda in 2020, according to Sentieo.\n\nSomewhat unusually, shares of Progenics are trading slightly above the implied offer price ($5.22 vs. $4.78). Merger arbitrageurs say such a situation can happen in an all-stock deal, particularly if shareholders are expecting the buyer to bump the offer. It could also signal the stock is actually trading independent of the deal because investors expect the activist to prevail, scrap the deal, and take steps to generate more value.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
