They were threatening my children.\"\n\nAgricultural disaster\n\nFreeth's employees were beaten with steel rods and his parents-in-law were seriously injured.\n\n\n\nThe violence culminated on August 30, 2009, when the Freeths returned from church to find their house was in flames.\n\nMugabe's land reform was launched in 2000 to re-distribute land awarded to whites during British colonial rule, which ended with Mugabe's election in 1980.\n\nTwenty years ago, 18% of the best land belonged to white Zimbabweans, which represented less than one percent of the population.\n\nBut the brutal eviction of white farmers, and their replacement by people who often had negligible skills, capital or experience in agriculture, caused a collapse in output, and with it Zimbabwe's economy.\n\n\"We have the best climate in the world and we are no longer capable to feed our population,\" said Freeth.\n\nOne third of Zimbabweans are dependent on food aid, according to the United Nations.\n\nHundreds of farms were placed in the hands of Mugabe's allies and of underqualified, poorly-equiped farmers.\n\n\n\nMount Carmel was awarded to Zimbabwean nationalist and ruling party ZANU-PF supporter Nathan Shamuyarira.\n\nThe workforce of 150 employees shrank to less than a tenth of its size, said Mount Carmel's newly-appointed manager, Simon Shema.\n\n\"Us blacks, we had no land to cultivate. Mugabe gave us the opportunity to farm,\" Shema told AFP.\n\nHe said he would be heading to Harare for Mugabe's funeral on Saturday to \"thank him\".\n\nSurrounded by broken-down machinery, Shema was convinced the farm would be running within the next two months.\n\nPaprika, peas and corn would be planted. And the mangoes on the trees - yellowed from the lack of irrigation - would be exported.\n\n\"We will start small, and grow,\" said Shema.\n\n'Stole their education'\n\nAlthough ZANU-PF acknowledged some of the failures of Mugabe's land reform, it said the benefits were still to come.\n\n\"Around 30% of the seized lands are not being used,\" said Tatenda Gwinji, a ZANU-PF representative in Chegutu. \"We are heading in the right direction.\"\n\nFreeth's former workers have been unemployed for the past decade.\n\n\"We had a good life. Now we have nothing, not even food to eat,\" Peter Assan, 62, told AFP.\n\n\"Once the white farmer had left, my children had to stop going to school because we had no money to pay for their fees,\" he said. \"Mugabe stole their education.\"\n\n\"The (land) reform did not accomplish the desired objective,\" said Mlauzi. \"And Mugabe caused productive farmers to flee.\"\n\nOf the 4 200 white farmers counted in Zimbabwe's last population census in 2000, only 400 work land in Zimbabwe, according to Freeth.\n\nHopes raised by the change in regime were rapidly quashed.\n\nMugabe's successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa pledged to revive the economy, but \"prices are soaring and our lives are even more difficult,\" said Mlauzi.\n\nMugabe's death was a \"non-event\", said Freeth. \"His legacy is still alive. A legacy of injustice, of absolute power and violence.\"\n\nBehind him, a cross pays tribute to Freeth's father-in-law, buried in a farm he can no longer access.", "description": "At its zenith, the Mount Carmel farm in northern Zimbabwe boasted 500 livestock and shipped its mangoes and lemons to Europe, a continent away.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6585/7e0b3de30633420ea1e06ab9468dc897.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
