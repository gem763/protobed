I\u2019m making a very serious statement that we don\u2019t want war,\u201d Zarif told CNN in an interview that aired Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to engage in a military confrontation,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe believe that a military confrontation based on deception is awful, will have a lot of casualties. But we won\u2019t blink to defend our territory.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have blamed Iran for drone attacks Saturday on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called the assault \u201can act of war\u201d against the kingdom, while President Donald Trump announced that he had directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u201cto substantially increase\u201d economic sanctions on Tehran in retaliation.\n\nThe Saudi military on Wednesday presented the remains of Iranian cruise missiles and drones it alleged were deployed in the aerial strike, and Col. Turki al-Maliki said the attacks were \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nIranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed credit for the attacks, while officials in Tehran have denied involvement. In his interview with CNN, Zarif continued to insist that the Islamic Republic was not behind the disruption of the international crude oil supply.\n\n\u201cNow they want to pin the blame on Iran in order to achieve something, and that is why I\u2019m saying this is agitation for war \u2014 because it\u2019s based on lies. It\u2019s based on deception,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you lie and deceive when it serves your interest. It doesn\u2019t even serve their interest.\u201d\n\nIran previously warned Washington against military intervention in a memo delivered to U.S. officials Monday through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran. The message communicated that \u201cthe Islamic Republic's reaction will be rapid and crushing and will likely target more extensive areas than the origin of the attack,\u201d Iran's state-run Fars News reported.", "description": "\u2018We won\u2019t blink to defend our territory.\u2019", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "Zoya Sheftalovich"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1157939365-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
