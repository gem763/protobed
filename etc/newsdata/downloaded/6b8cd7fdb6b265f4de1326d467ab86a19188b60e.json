As a result, temperatures dropped for at least 2m years.\n\nThe greatest threat to life on Earth may come from space Read more\n\nBecause the cooling occurred over such a long time, life on Earth had time to adapt. And while many species carried on unaffected in the warmer spots near the equator, others evolved to make the most of the world\u2019s freshly-formed colder regions.\n\n\u201cThis the first time it\u2019s been shown that dust from an asteroid break-up can lead to cooling that triggers an ice age on Earth,\u201d said Birger Schmitz, a professor of nuclear physics at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nEvidence from rock formations suggests that Earth experienced an unusual, short-lived ice age about 466m years ago. The drop in temperature locked water into ice that covered much of the planet, causing sea levels to fall globally. The period coincided with an apparent surge in the diversity of life on the planet, most of which was still in the oceans.\n\nIn the hope of shedding light on the mysterious ice age, Schmitz and his colleagues went looking for clues in ancient limestone rocks exposed at sites in southern Sweden and near St Petersburg in Russia. In particular, they looked for remnants of the huge asteroid, which geologists call the \u201cL chondrite parent body\u201d.\n\nThe researchers used acid to dissolve more than a tonne of limestone rocks of different ages from the sites. They then picked over what was left behind. They found that after the asteroid\u2019s destruction, the abundance of grains matching its chemical make-up rose by between 1,000 and 10,000 times. The levels stayed high for 2m-4m years. \u201cThe grains come with the dust so when you see an increase in these, you know there\u2019s been an increase in the dust,\u201d said Schmitz.\n\nFurther tests on the ancient limestone revealed a similar spike in levels of an isotope of helium that streams out of the sun in the surge of particles known as the solar wind. The researchers believe that the helium was brought to Earth when it became embedded in the finer space dust particles as they travelled through the solar system.\n\nWriting in Science Advances, the team describes how dust and coarse-grained particles from the asteroid\u2019s destruction rained down on Earth and became locked into sedimentary rocks. \u201cWe can nail that this ice age started to form when the dust from the break-up fell to Earth,\u201d Schmitz said. The asteroid still accounts for about a third of the meteorites that land on Earth.\n\nScientists call the apparent explosion in marine life at the time the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, or GOBE. David Harper, a palaeontologist at Durham University who worked on the study, said it was \u201cthe most spectacular hike in marine diversity in the history of life.\u201d.\n\n\u201cIce ages have been associated with major volcanic eruptions, but for the first time the team has implicated asteroid-derived dust in the initiation of global cooling and a major leap in biodiversity that changed marine ecosystems for ever,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Smashing of monster asteroid half a billion years ago thought to have caused mini ice age", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c55007810f2b4f7c29b5ad4a73a58e7aa2a6ec5/0_400_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32a348b014dcab6a59f0dc3842d9c078", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
