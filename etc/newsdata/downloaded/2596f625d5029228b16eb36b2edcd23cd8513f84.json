Icons, pictures or tantalising comments can be enough to pique our interest on subjects that aren\u2019t usually on our radar. With so many forums and websites dedicated to certain niches, it\u2019s not surprising that this is where the intriguing community of mediums and spiritualists has become a dominant presence.\n\nSo-called mediums and their platforms are typically shared via public groups. Viewers are encouraged to do so by said spiritualists, who often sway them with the promise that one of them could be in with a chance of winning a live-streamed reading.\n\nThe live-stream readings, often on Facebook, usually consist of \u201creaching out\u201d to a deceased loved-one or foreseeing future events.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMediums typically ask their viewers to pick a number between 0-100 and comment on which number they\u2019ve picked. Those watching usually continuously spam the live-stream by commenting their number over and over in the hope that it is seen and picked by the medium so they can provide a live reading. When the medium \u201cfeels connected\u201d to a number, they then start their reading.\n\nMany live-readings involve the medium asking the chosen viewer many questions, such as, \u201cdoes the colour blue mean anything to you?\u201d, \u201cDid you know someone who lived here?\u201d and sometimes leading statements, such as: \u201cSomeone with a name beginning with \u2018J\u2019 keeps wanting to speak to you through me\u201d, designed to push the viewer into providing the answers for them.\n\nBut are these live-streaming mediums legitimate? Or are they simply taking advantage of vulnerable people?\n\nCara Anette, a full-time medium registered with the International Psychic Association and International Holistic Therapies Association, believes that many online mediums are inauthentic. As an online medium herself, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t pick and choose a viewer, but rather go through the live-stream comment feed and choose which one I see first.\n\n\u201cMy readings involve channelling and connecting to the person\u2019s energy and anything that comes through such as smells, images, names, sound, taste, feelings, and words.\n\n\u201cClients shouldn\u2019t provide too much detail into their personal life, as this can blur a reading and, for less genuine mediums, give them the power to take advantage of vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nSo what types of people watch these live-streaming videos?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It comes as no surprise that, from personal observations, the majority of viewers of these live-streams are middle-aged women wanting to network within the world of online social media outside of their own list of friends.\n\nIt also indicates that individuals who have recently lost a loved-one and are desperately seeking comfort in their grief are drawn to the promises of mediums who seem to offer a precious chance to contact and/or speak to someone they\u2019ve lost, perhaps suddenly, without a final goodbye.\n\nAmanda Brandom practices mediumship privately for her own enlightenment, and believes that mediums who do live-readings aren\u2019t typically known in the medium community for being authentic. She said: \u201cMediumship isn\u2019t exactly about giving messages from those passed over. That\u2019s when the scammers come in and do live-streaming on networking sites.\n\n\u201cI always say to anyone who is interested in mediumship to visit their local spiritualist church and get a reading or a session done there. It\u2019s a blessed place. The mediums won\u2019t be recognised celebrities that often bring in a crowd, but they\u2019ve most likely been practicing for over 30 years, and can give readings for a few quid that will go towards the church.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that social media has become a brilliant place for individuals who otherwise might be lonely or bored to connect with a wider community with similar interests and passions, but it is sometimes far too easy to become embroiled with, and duped by someone who is not necessarily genuine.\n\nFor instance, there have been far too many stories in the news of lonely women being scammed out of thousands of pounds by users pretending to be celebrities, or by far-away \u201clovers\u201d, asking for money from their homes abroad.\n\nWhile the mediums I spoke to had good intentions, it\u2019s clear online readings are becoming a bigger problem. With the aforementioned vulnerabilities in mind, it\u2019s not surprising that emotional trauma lends itself to buying into practices like these. Offering users the chance to contact the afterlife on social media is extremely tempting, especially given the fact that it\u2019s a \u201ctalent\u201d that many don\u2019t understand. And often don\u2019t seek to.\n\nHowever, thinking twice and doing more research into the subject, rather than responding to probable scammers via a live-stream that isn\u2019t private or personal, may help to save individuals from the possible grief of both losing their cash and the heartache of realising they haven't connected with a loved-one in the afterlife.\n\nSticking to social media to speak with those who are alive, and cherishing those moments, will be a better option, no doubt. And if the spiritually-inclined still insist on wanting to speak to deceased loved-ones, perhaps visiting an authentic spiritualist in-person (if that\u2019s what they prefer), or even waiting until their own time comes, are safer means of providing them with more promising answers.", "description": "You can get lost in pretty much any topic on social media.
