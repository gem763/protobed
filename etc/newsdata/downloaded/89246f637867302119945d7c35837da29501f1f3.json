The current Liberal government introduced the measure in its 2019 federal budget, and a three-month consultation on an exemption for \u201cstart-ups and rapidly growing Canadian businesses\u201d ended in September. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Canadian scale-ups have expressed concern that the cap will hurt their ability to hire and retain skilled workers. The Conservatives are the only one of the four major parties not to have taken a position on the stock-options deduction, although Scheer noted that many \u201chigh-tech companies\u201d start with \u201csmall numbers of people who had foregone paycheques while they\u2019re investing in the company,\u201d and that \u201craising taxes on innovators\u201d ensures that Canada won\u2019t compete for investments or talent. The NDP and Liberals have both proposed to tax all such gains, although the former told The Logic it will maintain the carve-out for \u201csmall and medium enterprises.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
