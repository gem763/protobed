I\u2019m aware of\u2013I know we got some negative press when we were over there last,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not in control of supply and demand, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d\n\nSo we truly have nobody to blame but ourselves for The Wombats being on every second lineup over here. Supply and demand, baby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really funny actually because we got offered some kind of big shows over the new year \u2013 shall we say,\u201d Murph continued.\n\n\u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t\u2026like it was such a huge conversation I was like \u2018guys we just fuckin\u2026we just gotta chill out for a bit.'\u201d\n\nThough he promises he\u2019s not trying to gun for residency with the new Love Fame Tragedy project, he hopes we\u2019ll all be OK with him returning to Australia under a new name.\n\nWith only a handful of very intimate shows across the UK and US under his belt (and a casual last-minute slot at Reading), he\u2019ll be bringing the Love Fame Tragedy show to Aus for a couple of small gigs in Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne in October.\n\nAs for the music itself, he\u2019s just dropped his first Love Fame Tragedy EP, \u2018I Don\u2019t Want To Play The Victim, But I\u2019m Really Good At It\u2019, today, and Murph has swindled some of his mates from his personal (and probably chockas) Rolodex to play on it \u2013 including Mark Stoermer from The Killers, and Alt-J\u2019s Gus Unger-Hamilton among a bunch of others.", "description": "The Wombats' Matt 'Murph' Murphy is bringing his solo act Love Fame Tragedy to Aus for Yours & Owls Fest, and he hopes we're OK with that.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/murph-lft-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
