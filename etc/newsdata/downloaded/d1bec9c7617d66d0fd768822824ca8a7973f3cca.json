Josh Hawley has a new bill to let consumers opt out of pervasive tracking", "language": "en", "text": "Ctrl + N\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., speaks during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nSen. Josh Hawley wants to make opting out of online tracking as easy as adding your number to the \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list.\n\nHawley, a Missouri Republican, will introduce legislation on Tuesday to create a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d program: It would require companies to limit data collection on Americans who check a setting in their web browsers or install a special app on their phones.\n\nIt would also impose hefty fines on companies that, after people opt out, continue the controversial but pervasive practice of collecting broad data about consumers' browsing activity or building highly customized profiles about them. Such profiles are commonly used to serve targeted advertisements.\n\nPast initiatives to create \u201cDo Not Track\u201d options have failed to stop companies' tracking because they were voluntary, Hawley said, promising this bill would have teeth and finally give consumers more control over how business uses their data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried the voluntary model,\u201d Hawley said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop this two-step.\u201d\n\nHawley is pushing for this legislation as he aims to raise awareness on Capitol Hill about the shadowy ways companies follow consumers online \u2014 sometimes collecting data about consumers even after they think they've opted out. Hawley, a freshman, is making it his mission to fight Big Tech on Capitol Hill, and the fines he's proposing are the latest signal that Washington is seeking tougher penalties against Silicon Valley.\n\nHawley also thinks a Do Not Track initiative should be part of any federal privacy legislation. The senator made waves in Congress on this issue after a fiery exchange Google executive Will DeVries earlier this year, when Hawley slammed the company for collecting location data about Android users even when location history is turned off. His office says this bill also stems from concerns about Facebook's practice of collecting data from people online even if they don't have an account with the service, which is known in the industry as building \u201cshadow profiles.\u201d\n\nHawley's bill does not yet have any co-sponsors, but it's likely an issue that could earn support across the aisle. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) introduced similar legislation in 2011 though the bill languished in Congress. The Obama administration's Federal Trade Commission also supported the creation of a Do Not Track setting \u2014 but it ultimately did not result in any requirements.\n\nHawley thinks that this bill will be able to succeed where the Obama-era initiative fell short. The FTC at the time created a working group to develop a Do Not Track button, but it leaned heavily on the tech industry to come up with the best way to implement Do Not Track. It turned acrimonious as there was infighting within the group about what \u201ctracking\u201d means.\n\nBrowser makers like Microsoft and Mozilla have also tried to implement Do Not Track buttons, which notify advertisers and websites that a person does not want to be tracked. But there\u2019s currently no way to enforce it, and advertisers can continue to track people even with the setting enabled.\n\nThat\u2019s why Hawley thinks there needs to be an actual law on the books. His bill would also restrict companies from transferring the data they collect about consumers to other companies if they activate Do Not Track. Companies would also have to let consumers know they have these privacy rights to opt out of such tracking.\n\nIf companies knowingly fail to comply with these rules, they could face penalties of up to $1,000 per day per person. But to be sure the fines pack a punch \u2014 the minimum fine for violations is not less than $100,000. Even if companies are found not to knowingly break the law, they would face penalties of $50 per day per person for negligence.\n\nTo be sure, recent history shows that efforts to get companies to change their behavior are tricky. A model for this legislation \u2014 the Do Not Call registry \u2014 was created in 2003 to help consumers limit unwanted calls they are receiving from telemarketers. But it has proved ineffective in protecting them from an onslaught of robocalls in recent years.\n\nHawley says he's encouraged by the prospects of change as there's been a significant shift in attitudes toward the tech industry in Washington \u2014 and scrutiny of privacy issues in both parties.\n\n\u201cThere is a dawning awareness these big tech companies pose a new but unique threat to consumer privacy, free speech and the future of our economy that we\u2019re just beginning to get our hands and our heads around,\u201d Hawley told me.\n\nYou are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nBITS: Google halted its business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services, except when available via open source, according to Angela Moon of Reuters. The move follows a decision by the Trump administration last week to add Huawei to the \"entities list,\" which could effectively blacklist Huawei from working with U.S. suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,\u201d a Google spokesperson told Reuters.\n\n\u201cFor users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,\u201d the spokesperson also told Reuters, without giving further details.\n\nCurrent holders of Huawei smartphones with Google apps will still be able to download apps and updates, according to Reuters. But Huawei will immediately lose access to Google's Android operating system. Future versions of the phones running Android will also lose common Google-operated apps, such as YouTube and Gmail.\n\nChipmakers including Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told the Financial Times about the briefings, which he helped organize. \u201cIt\u2019s important that US companies, universities, and trade organizations understand fully that threat.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence officials are at times sharing classified information in the briefings, which began last October.

The company had to shut down a party at a satellite California office, and at least one employee resigned, according to current and former employees.\n\nThe celebrations kicked off with company-provided mimosas, and employees said the event \"made them feel uncomfortable and seemed immature,\" Faiz writes, especially as the company's stock price plunged. It also was a reminder of a more toxic company culture that Uber has been trying to fix.\n\n\u201cOld Uber hid themselves until today apparently,\u201d one employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly, told Faiz.\n\nUber has been trying to repair its image after female employees accused the company of failing to address allegations of sexual harassment over the last two years and supporting a \"tech bro\" culture. Uber hired a former U.S. attorney general to conduct a study of its workplace culture, among other remedies. That 13-page study recommended the company limit the availability of alcohol in the workplace and de-emphasizing alcohol as a component of work events.\n\nPRIVATE CLOUD\n\n-- Tech news from the private sector:\n\nTechnology Tesla Model 3 Autopilot was active before deadly collision, federal investigators say The collision was at least the third fatal crash in the U.S. involving Tesla's driver-assistance system.
