Reviewers say the phones offer significant enhancements over devices like the iPhone 6, which was released in 2014, but the changes are likely too incremental to justify trading up from newer models.\n\nRead: Apple\u2019s new iPhones reportedly selling better than their predecessors\n\nBrian X. Chen of the New York Times said that the new phones underscored that the prior law of upgrades \u2014 get a new phone every two years \u2014 no longer holds.\n\n\u201cYou should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 11 starts at $699, while the iPhone 11 Pro begins at $999 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099.\n\nSee more: Apple drops price on new iPhone 11, undercuts Netflix and Disney on streaming\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern highlighted her perceived dilemma for those who currently own the iPhone X, which Apple AAPL, -1.46% debuted two years back: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the most modern design but you\u2019re now behind on battery life, Face ID improvements and camera tricks. Yet if you upgrade this go-round, you might miss out on next year\u2019s expected big refresh with 5G and more.\u201d\n\nShe advised keeping your current phone for another year \u201cif you can live with\u201d it, or else going for the base-model iPhone 11, which lacks the OLED screen and telephoto camera that the iPhone X has, but allows users to save some money, which could later be put toward the expected 5G phone out next year.\n\nNonetheless, the features that Apple chose to focus on among this year\u2019s updates got fairly strong reviews from those who tried out the devices. \u201cThe iPhone 11 Pro cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and they beat the Pixel and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 10 Plus in most of our side-by-side comparisons,\u201d wrote Nilay Patel of the Verge. \u201cIn fact, I think the iPhone 11 Pro is the best smartphone camera on the market right now.\u201d\n\nHe also praised the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s speakers, saying they\u2019re \u201creally loud and generally sound better than ever.\u201d\n\nOpinion: Apple iPhone event reveals a dramatic change in strategy\n\nTechCrunch\u2019s Matthew Panzarino had some compliments for the new ultrawide-angle camera, which is coming to all three devices announced this year. \u201cIn my testing of the wide angle, it showed off extremely well especially in bright conditions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt allowed for great close up family shots, wide angle portraits that emphasized dynamism and vistas that really opened up possibilities for shooting that haven\u2019t been on iPhone before.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Stern seemed especially pleased with the battery life on the three new phones, writing that talk of upgraded cameras, glass and colors was \u201cmostly just smoke-and-mirrors marketing\u201d but that the battery upgrades are for real.\n\nThe iPhone 11 family promises \u201cone thing many of us have wanted all along: phones that are a bit heavier and thicker \u2014 but work when we damn well need them to,\u201d according to Stern. \u201cYes, longer battery life.\u201d\n\nOpinion: Apple\u2019s new iPhones are overpriced and behind the times\n\nApple opened up preorders for the three devices late last week, and they officially become available this Friday.\n\nShares have gained 40% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.59% has risen 16%.", "description": "Apple Inc.\u2019s new iPhones have great cameras and battery life, but the key question remains whether consumers will deem them worth an upgrade.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR025_apple__ZG_20190910140921.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
