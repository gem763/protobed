And this wasn't what the Nationals needed, either: A second consecutive home loss to the Astros, this one by an 8-1 score Saturday night, to leave the Fall Classic tied at two games apiece.\n\n\"You make mistakes, you're going to pay,\" Corbin said about facing Houston's stacked lineup. \"They got on me early.\"\n\nNo, this flop was not entirely Corbin's fault, even if he did leave trailing 4-0. Yes, reliever Fernando Rodney gave up Alex Bregman's grand slam in the seventh inning as part of the sort of bullpen meltdown that happened over and over early this season.\n\nAnd, don't forget, the Nationals' bats stayed virtually silent for the second straight game: They have scored a total of two runs over the past 18 innings.\n\n\"We want to forget relatively quickly,\" said right fielder Adam Eaton, who was 0 for 3. \"It's easy to erase.\"\n\nStill, while Corbin and his sweeping slider did what they were supposed to during the regular season \u2014 14-7, 3.25 ERA, 238 strikeouts in 202 innings \u2014 it's this time of year that really matters the most, and he has not produced as promised in his first postseason.\n\n\"These are games I want to pitch in,\" Corbin said Friday, looking ahead to Game 4.\n\nBut he hasn't been at his best.\n\nThis outing \u2014 four runs, seven hits, two walks over six innings \u2014 dropped Corbin's postseason record to 1-3 in seven appearances, three as a starter. Get this: He's been so mediocre that Saturday's so-so showing actually lowered his ERA in October to 6.64.\n\nThings were tough for him right from the get-go, with Houston getting four singles in a row in the first inning as a group of visiting fans in the upper deck beyond right field waved their orange towels and chanted \"Let's go, Astros!\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve reached base for the 24th straight postseason game. Michael Brantley got the first of his three hits. Bregman and Yuli Gurriel delivered RBIs.\n\n\"We were throwing some sliders,\" catcher Yan Gomes said, \"and they weren't really biting on it.\"\n\nA double play eventually extricated Corbin from that mess, but more problems arose in the fourth.\n\nThat's when he gave Carlos Correa a leadoff walk before missing the mark on a 1-0 pitch to Chirinos, who sent it out to left in a hurry.\n\n\"It was,\" Chirinos summed up, \"a bad pitch.\"\n\nNo one was yet warming up in the home bullpen. This was Corbin's game to win or lose. It didn't turn out how Washington hoped.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
