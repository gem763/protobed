Starring: Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson, Kyliegh Curran, Carl Lumbly, Zahn McClarnon. 15 cert, 152 mins\n\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that Stephen King was never a fan of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining. In fact, he hated it. The director had thrown out his original ending and decided not to explore the Torrances\u2019 family dynamic. With Doctor Sleep, writer-director Mike Flanagan has tried to stitch up that decades-old wound. It\u2019s an adaptation of King\u2019s own sequel to his book, but one that exists in the same universe as the film. You\u2019ll still see the same distinctive pattern in the hallway carpets and two little girls, dressed in blue, beckoning Danny to \u201ccome play with us\u201d.\n\nBut melding two distinctive voices into one (make that three, including Flanagan\u2019s) is a major gamble. Here, it doesn\u2019t pay off. We open on an adult Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), doomed to follow in the footsteps of his alcoholic father. He drinks both to banish the memories of what happened to him in the Overlook Hotel and to suppress the telepathic powers he was born with \u2013 what he refers to as \u201cthe Shining\u201d. One day, a young girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran) makes contact. She\u2019s just like him, only more powerful. But she needs his help. Danny must confront his past in order to stop the True Knot, a group of semi-immortals who feed off the \u201cshine\u201d of young children.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of story that usually populates the pages of superhero comics and, in truth, Doctor Sleep rarely has the feel of a horror film. It\u2019s too entangled in King\u2019s obsessive worldbuilding, switching between characters and narrative threads without actually taking the time to create any sense of terror or dread. The exception is Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s slithering turn as villain Rose the Hat. With a sugary voice and a piercing stare, she plays the master manipulator as a 21st-century update on CS Lewis\u2019s White Witch \u2013 an ensnarer of children with an ice-cold streak.\n\nThe film\u2019s attempts to recreate The Shining (or, at least, revisit it) range from technically impressive to borderline silly, but never scary. Flanagan might mimic Kubrick\u2019s camera techniques, but he robs them of their significance. All those tracking shots and crossfades helped create the nauseating claustrophobia of the Overlook; when the action takes place over a decade and across several states, it doesn\u2019t have quite the same effect. Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind\u2019s original score, with those electronic notes that sound like foghorns, only appears once. Otherwise, it\u2019s a more conventional mix of orchestral groans and violin shrieks by the Newton brothers, punctured by the sound of a beating heart.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Stanley Kubrick's films ranked - from worst to best 1/13 13. Fear and Desire (1953) Kubrick suppressed Fear and Desire\u2019s availability for decades, and given his well documented disdain for his first full-length feature, you would be forgiven for thinking that any trailer for Fear and Desire should have the rider \u201cFor Kubrick completists and cinephiles only\u201d. However, this allegorical anti-war movie following four soldiers caught behind enemy lines has more going for it than its reputation would suggest. Rex Features 2/13 12. Killer\u2019s Kiss (1955) Kubrick\u2019s second feature was another shoestring-budget affair, but he stepped up a couple of divisions for this stylish film noir about a boxer involved with a nightclub dancer menaced by her lecherous boss. New Yorker Kubrick made good use of authentic, shadow-filled Manhattan locations for his first outing in dark city which has many classic noir tropes \u2013 the film is told in flashback by a world weary narrator, there\u2019s love, deception, murder and revenge, and a striking denouement as hero and villain battle it out in a warehouse filled with mannequins. Rex Features 3/13 11. Eyes Wide Shut (1999) An affluent doctor is tortured by thoughts that his wife had contemplated cheating on him. Starring then husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Eyes Wide Shut was impossibly hyped as art house porn featuring Hollywood\u2019s golden couple and as the master\u2019s final masterpiece. It\u2019s neither of course, merely a fairly interesting erotic drama that crawls at a snail\u2019s pace at times, even by Kubrick\u2019s standards. Rex Features 4/13 10. Lolita (1962) A case of wrong time, wrong place for Kubrick who was constrained both by the censors and by filming in England, where he had moved with his family the previous year, his adaption of Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s infamous novel about a middle-aged professor\u2019s infatuation with a sexually precocious adolescent girl. Kubrick later claimed if he had known beforehand how severe the censorship restrictions would be, he wouldn\u2019t have made Lolita, but Nabokov revealed that Kubrick had incorporated several things into the film that he wished he had thought of for the novel. Rex Features 5/13 9. Spartacus (1960) As mainstream as Kubrick ever got, Spartacus is the archetypal Hollywood sword and sandals blockbuster and the least Kubrick-like movie in his oeuvre, partially because of producer/star Kirk Douglas\u2019s input and also because Kubrick felt hamstrung by Dalton Trumbo\u2019s screenplay which he didn\u2019t much care for. Star and director didn\u2019t always see eye to eye either. Douglas, exasperated by Kubrick\u2019s meticulous attention to detail, reckoned that he spent longer making Spartacus than the slaves\u2019 rebellion lasted. Spartacus remains a great spectacle however, if a bit wordy, and won four Oscars, none of them for Kubrick. Rex Features 6/13 8. Full Metal Jacket (1987) Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam movie is a visceral experience which follows a group of raw Marine volunteers from boot camp to action in the Tet Offensive. Kubrick explores the dehumanising effect that not just combat but the brutal training regime under a profane, bullying instructor has on the recruits. Coming after a succession of highly regarded Vietnam movies, The Deer Hunter (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1987), Full Metal Jacket perhaps suffered by comparison. Rex Features 7/13 7. A Clockwork Orange (1971) From the Burgess novel, Kubrick\u2019s scathing satire set in a dystopian society in the not so distant future predictably caused controversy on release and continued to do so for many years afterwards, with one reviewer accusing Kubrick of creating \u201cintellectual pornography\u201d. Disturbed by reports that the stylised violence in the film had provoked copycat crimes, Kubrick withdrew the film in Britain in 1973 and it wasn\u2019t made available again until 2000, a year after Kubrick\u2019s death. Rex Features 8/13 6. Barry Lyndon (1975) Boasting sumptuous production values, this exquisitely mounted, leisurely paced adaption of William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s novel about the rise and fall of an 18th-century Irish rogue hero received middling reviews when released, but still won four Academy Awards, including not surprisingly, the costume, cinematography and art direction categories; for Barry Lyndon is undoubtedly one of the most stunningly beautiful pictures ever made. Kubrick shot all but a few scenes by natural light and candlelight, investing the film with the authentic look of the period and evoking the works of Hogarth and Gainsborough \u2013 exactly the look that Kubrick desired Rex Features 9/13 5. The Killing (1956) A huge leap forward from Kubrick\u2019s first two ultra-low budget independent features Fear and Desire and Killer\u2019s Kiss, The Killing has shades of The Asphalt Jungle (1950), not least in the casting of Sterling Hayden as the career criminal who recruits a team of specialists for one last racecourse heist. The caper goes to plan perfectly but the aftermath gradually and inexorably unravels in spectacular and bloody fashion. Don\u2019t let the clich\u00e9d Dragnet-style narration or the B movie status put you off \u2013 this is top notch film noir with a lean, mean approach that proved hugely influential in the years to come, serving as the blueprint for Reservoir Dogs (1992). Rex Features 10/13 4. The Shining (1980) Author Stephen King, upset at the wholesale changes made by the director, hated Kubrick\u2019s adaption of his celebrated and terrifying novel. However, The Shining still works as a chilling horror movie with Kubrick putting his own indelible stamp on proceedings \u2013 the jaw-dropping tracking shot of the child on his tricycle, the shocking image of torrents of blood flowing from an elevator. Kubrick was also happy to give his actors full latitude to improvise and Jack Nicholson is in full scenery chewing mode, his descent into madness making for mesmerising viewing. Rex Features 11/13 3. Paths of Glory (1957) There are many Kubrick aficionados who cite Paths of Glory as his greatest film. It is certainly his first masterpiece and may well be the greatest anti-war film ever made, with its shattering portrayal of the slaughter in the trenches of the First World War and the jockeying for promotions of the self-serving army generals who view the men on the frontline as mere cannon fodder in their own quest for advancement. Winston Churchill considered Paths of Glory to have been the most realistic depiction of trench warfare, but the film\u2019s themes could have been set to any war and told from the perspective of any nation. Rex Features 12/13 2. Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) Kubrick is at his most relentlessly cynical with this bitterly hilarious satire on the twisted logic of having the so-called ultimate deterrent in the first place. Perhaps only Kubrick would dare make a film about nuclear Armageddon as the Cold War was intensifying and so soon after the Cuban Missile Crisis, as he speculates on the consequences of the wrong person with their finger on the trigger. With fantastic sets courtesy of Ken Adams, outstanding black and white cinematography, a devastating script with lines quoted ad infinitum, (\u201cGentlemen, you can\u2019t fight in here! This is the War Room!\u201d) and a uniformly brilliant cast, allied to Kubrick\u2019s fearless approach throughout, climaxing in the montage of mushroom clouds to the strains of \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, Dr Strangelove is peak Kubrick, finding humour in the most chilling of subject matters. Rex Features 13/13 1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) A milestone film that places space exploration in the context of humankind\u2019s evolution, whilst contemplating a higher power and the meaning of life in a future where computers call the shots; rarely has a film provoked so much analysis and debate, which was probably Kubrick\u2019s intention from the outset. What, for example, is the head-scratching ending all about, and what is the true purpose of the mysterious black monolith that pops up on Earth, then the Moon and finally in outer space as the spaceship heads for Jupiter? These conundrums all add to the mystery and aura of a film in which Kubrick\u2019s legendary attention to detail with regards to the sets stretched to importing just the right type of sand and washing and painting it to accurately portray the moon\u2019s surface. Rex Features 1/13 13. Fear and Desire (1953) Kubrick suppressed Fear and Desire\u2019s availability for decades, and given his well documented disdain for his first full-length feature, you would be forgiven for thinking that any trailer for Fear and Desire should have the rider \u201cFor Kubrick completists and cinephiles only\u201d.

McGregor may be committed to his character, but the script doesn\u2019t give him too much to do. His final confrontation with his own alcoholism is so painfully on the nose, it ruins the sincerity of anything that might have come before. There\u2019s no room for subtlety here \u2013 Doctor Sleep is too busy being tossed between the triadic worlds of Kubrick, King, and Flanagan.", "description": "Dir: Mike Flanagan.
