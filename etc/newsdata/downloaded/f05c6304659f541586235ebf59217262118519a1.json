The student admitted to tearing down at least four TPUSA posters, one of which, simply read, \u201cI love America.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by fellow student and TPUSA member Caleb Anderson if he loved America, the vandal responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The incident was caught on video.\n\nWatch below:\n\n\u201cI wanted to ask why you ripped down our TPUSA poster today,\u201d said Anderson in the video.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support you,\u201d affirmed the student. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see [the poster] on campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that gives you a right to destruction of property?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not destruction of property, dude.\u201d\n\nThe vandal added that he did not consider the tearing down of TPUSA posters to be a violation of his peers\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cDo you support free speech on college campuses?\u201d asked Anderson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you support free speech as long as it\u2019s not TPUSA?\u201d\n\n\u201cI support free speech as it relates to government,\u201d responded the vandal, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that prohibits other people from limiting your free speech.\u201d\n\nAnderson then informed the student that he and his group have been working hard to spread their message, and extended an invite for the student to come to a TPUSA meeting to express his differing views, rather than tearing down the conservative group\u2019s posters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little bit disappointing that we\u2019ve been putting in a lot of hard work to try to spread our message,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cIf you disagree with us, we welcome you to our meetings. We want you to come to our meetings if there\u2019s something that you disagree with us on. But at the same time, we would just ask that you don\u2019t rip down our posters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably gonna still continue doing it anyways,\u201d Anderson continued, \u201cbut we want you not to do that. I mean, that discourages other people \u2014 we don\u2019t go around and disrespect any other people\u2019s property, we don\u2019t rip it down off the wall. So I just ask that if you\u2019re part of a community of individuals on a college campus that you respect everyone\u2019s opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to have your opinion just like everyone else is allowed to have theirs,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re not harming anybody \u2014 we\u2019re just having a poster that said \u2018I love America\u2019 \u2014 do you love America?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d responded the student.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "A student at the\u00a0University of Minnesota Duluth was captured on video admitting to tearing down Turning Point USA posters, which read, \"I love America.\"", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/College-protest-against-fascism-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
