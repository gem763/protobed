He sees the Bank of Canada cutting interest rates four times as a result.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at the Canadian economy right now, it\u2019s really quite bifurcated,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cI call it the Triple C economy: there\u2019s crude, condos and cannabis.\u201d\n\nCanada has remained fairly resilient in the face of global weakness with rising immigration feeding labour market and wage gains, along with a rebounding housing market. But there are mounting concerns that it can\u2019t remain an indefinite holdout as the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown among trading partners take their toll.\n\nRod Balkwill, executive director of Saskatchewan\u2019s Treasury Management Branch, said he sees a 60 per cent to 70 per cent risk of a recession, noting the housing market\u2019s strength is \u201cpretty narrowly based.\u201d Charles Allain, an executive director in Nova Scotia\u2019s finance department, said he\u2019s raised the odds substantially.\n\n\u201cThis time last year, I would\u2019ve said a very small potential of 10 per cent to 15 per cent,\u201d said Allain. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to think it\u2019s closer to 50 per cent now.\u201d\n\nThe consensus is that slower growth is on the horizon: economists expecting Canadian gross domestic product to decelerate to 1.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent last year. That\u2019s compared with 2.3 per cent forecast in 2019 for the U.S. from 2.9 per cent in the prior year.\n\nBut predictions of recession were outliers at the conference. The probability of a recession was 25 per cent at the most recent Bloomberg survey of economists, compared with 35 per cent in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe drivers of the economy continue to be our old friends of housing in particular coming back, but in terms of investment and trade we don\u2019t have a huge amount of optimism surrounding those sectors,\u201d said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, who sees a 30 per cent to 40 per cent chance.\n\nNational Bank of Canada Chief Economist Stefane Marion concurred, saying the fundamentals that underpin the Canadian economy are still quite strong and inflation continues to hug the Bank of Canada\u2019s inflation target of 2 per cent.\n\nIf a recession does come, it \u201ccould actually be a lot more severe than people think,\u201d according to David Wolf, part of the asset allocation team at Fidelity Investments Canada.\n\n\u201cThe reason for that is it\u2019s most likely to come from abroad,\u201d Wolf said, adding that it could result in Canada\u2019s first credit-cycle retrenchment since the early 1990s.\n\nWolf said he\u2019s underweight the Canadian dollar and expects to see a \u201cpretty significant depreciation in the currency\u201d over the medium to long term.\n\n\u201cCanada actually stands out for us as being one of the more vulnerable economies despite what looks like a pretty good environment right now,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Some economists at Bloomberg's Canadian Fixed Income Conference say Canada won't be a bright spot in global economy for much longer", "authors": ["Natalie Obiko Pearson", "Doug Alexander", "Kevin Orland", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canadian-flag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
