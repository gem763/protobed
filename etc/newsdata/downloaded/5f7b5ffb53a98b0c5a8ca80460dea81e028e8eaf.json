They called it 'slow', 'superfluous' and 'worse than bad'.\n\nVox's take was: 'They slow down the action to the point where El Camino's biggest weakness is that it feels like it\u2019s going nowhere a lot of the time \u2014 out of character for a show that always felt as though every scene or joke or line of dialogue served to move the story forward.'\n\nThe Guardian criticized the film's structure, saying it felt more like a 'feature-length TV episode' than movie.\n\n'It is too compact and fragmented to truly stand on its own, and viewers who have not seen the preceding 62 hours of Breaking Bad will likely struggle to enjoy it,' its critic said.\n\nDeadline was even less generous.\n\n'Unlike the brilliance that was so much of the multiple Emmy winning series\u2019 five season run on AMC, El Camino, is a half measure sequel, to paraphrase Jonathan Banks\u2019 Mike Ehrmantraut in that pivotal twelfth episode of Season 3 of Breaking Bad.\n\nIt\u2019s not that El Camino is bad, it\u2019s not. The Vince Gilligan penned and directed project is actually worse than that in many ways.\n\n'It\u2019s worse because it neither sucks nor soars. El Camino mainly just fills space, and likely time \u2013 something Breaking Bad never did,' its critic said.\n\nIconic: Breaking Bad followed dejected high-school chemistry teacher Walter White, who starts making Crystal Meth with former student Jesse, after being diagnosed with lung cancer\n\nDrama: El Camino follows Jesse, now on the run, as he tries to put his life back together after escaping with his life from an Aryan Brotherhood gang after their clash with Walter White\n\nVariety it as 'a story stretching its limits' and Jesse as 'more avatar than person'.\n\nThe movie follows Pinkman in the 48 hours after he breaks free from the meth-lab and as he tries to escape Albuquerque before he can be arrested or killed.\n\nHe sets his sights on Alaska and the viewer follows him as he attempts to leave the New Mexico town where he and White set-up and operated their unlikely drug empire.\n\nIt is peppered with flashbacks which allows for the reintroduction of characters from the show who were killed off, including White.\n\nBreaking Bad followed dejected high-school chemistry teacher Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who decides to start making Crystal Meth with his former student Jesse, after he was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nOriginally intending to make money as a way to pay for his treatment and support his family, Walt soon loses himself to the apparent advantages of criminal life and soon becomes a drug lord known by the pseudonym Heisenberg.\n\nDeadline was among outlets whose film critics said the film was disappointing\n\nBut fans loved the movie and called for Paul and the movie's creator to be rewarded with Oscars\n\nJesse was last seen driving off into the night after being kidnapped and forced under duress to make Meth for Todd (Jesse Plemons), his uncle Jack (Michael Bowen), and his gang of goons.\n\nHe managed to escape after Walt -now a wanted man- came to kill Todd and the Aryan brotherhood with a machine gun he concealed in the back of his car to remove the last few people who know how to make his Blue Sky drug.\n\nJesse, who then had an estranged relationship with Walt, was brought out of his underground prison-turned-lab to see him, and, in his rage, tackles his former business partner to the ground.\n\nDuring the punch-up, Jesse triggered the switch connected to the machine gun which then fired into the room, mortally injuring Walt, and killing everyone inside except for himself.\n\nNow free from his captors, Jesse drives off in delight while Walt returns to the lab as police come to raid the premises, but, before they can catch him, he collapses and dies of his gunshot wound.\n\nBreaking Bad aired on AMC for five seasons from 2008-2013; The series boasts 16 Prime Time Emmy wins and 58 nominations as well as two Peabody Awards.\n\nEl Camino is out now in select cinemas and on Netflix.", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: Film critics have been harsher in their review of the two-hour production, calling it a 'flat tire' which leaves much to be desired in the wake of the show's monumental success.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Roxy Simons For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19592138-0-image-a-24_1570822158147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
