A few blocks south, just past construction cranes symbolizing the city\u2019s rise, the Indians push toward a possible playoff spot in the early innings of a day/night doubleheader.\n\nAs Mayfield looks toward FirstEnergy Stadium, home of the Browns, the empty orange seats seem to glow.\n\n\u201cAwesome view,\u201d Mayfield says.\n\nClearly, he\u2019s on top of Cleveland.\n\nOnly 13 starts into his career, Mayfield, whose selection as the No. 1 overall pick in 2018 drew a mixed reaction here and around the league, has Cleveland\u2019s football pulse racing. Around here, the Browns, so bad for so long, are back.\n\nSometimes arrogant, always assured, the 24-year-old quarterback is being hailed as the franchise\u2019s savior, the one to finally lead the Browns from the gutter to glory.\n\nIn whirlwind fashion, Mayfield has captured Cleveland\u2019s heart: \u201cBaker 2:16\u201d T-shirts are for sale around town, and there\u2019s no shortage of No. 6 jerseys or headbands like the one he wears under his orange, logo-less helmet.\n\nFrom the moment he came off the bench in Week 3 and led a comeback win over the New York Jets, ending Cleveland\u2019s 19-game winless streak, Mayfield has felt at home. The kid from Texas with the Texas-sized chip on his shoulder believes his passion meshes perfectly in a city where football\u2019s more than a game.\n\n\u201cThere are characteristics and values that I have that go hand in hand with what the people of Cleveland have,\u201d Mayfield tells The Associated Press. \u201cI think all natural relationships happen very quickly because it\u2019s meant to be, and I think this is one of those things where it was just meant to be. I relate to the people here on a lot of facets: the blue-collar work ethic mentality and just embracing it.\n\n\u201cPeople here want their football team to be great and it\u2019s a football town, and I want my team to be great.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s already given glimpses of potential greatness.\n\nLast season, Mayfield broke Peyton Manning\u2019s rookie record with 27 touchdown passes in just 14 games. He did it with pinpoint accuracy and a fearless style that included trash-talking opponents; giving a cold shoulder to former Browns coach Hue Jackson; and following a three-TD performance by saying, \u201cI woke up feeling real dangerous,\u201d a catch phrase that\u2019s now part of the local lexicon.\n\nMayfield further endeared himself to Cleveland fans this summer by biting into a beer can and chugging the contents while being shown on the scoreboard at an Indians game.\n\n\u201cYeah, first time,\u201d Mayfield says chuckling about his now-famous guzzle.\n\nSome of his actions have not played well outside of the area, but the same also could have been said for Tom Brady, Brett Favre and Jim McMahon.\n\nBecause of Mayfield, and a roster injected with new talented players including star receiver Odell Beckham Jr., the Browns are viewed as legitimate contenders this season. That may seem a little farfetched, a lot premature. But the Browns, who went 0-16 two years ago and have been a disgrace for much of their expansion era, are the league\u2019s trendy pick in the AFC North, at least.\n\nThe young quarterback is unfazed by the hype.\n\n\u201cI was made to be able to kind of handle these types of situations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a difference a year makes, huh? From not getting reps with the ones (starters) at training camp to being the guy here and just being comfortable in it. It doesn\u2019t surprise me, because I just go with the flow, take the punches and run with it and really just take it one day at a time.\n\n\u201cIt could become overwhelming if you look at everything on the outside or worry too much. Take it a day at a time, and I\u2019m living out a dream.\u201d\n\nThere is immediate pressure to win. That weight will fall on Mayfield and Freddie Kitchens, who started last season as Cleveland\u2019s running backs coach before an eight-game stint as offensive coordinator convinced general John Dorsey and owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam to make him the team\u2019s sixth coach in 10 years.\n\nLike his quarterback, Kitchens, who played the positon at Alabama, doesn\u2019t mince words with his southern drawl. He\u2019s loyal, direct, unabashed.\n\n\u201cHe is who he is. He doesn\u2019t care what anybody thinks,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cHe holds nothing back, but that\u2019s the best part about it. \u2026 He\u2019s never going to lie to you. He\u2019s going to set you straight and tell you the truth - whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nMayfield\u2019s summer was smooth - mostly. He got married in July. Cleveland\u2019s training camp was drama free, save for Beckham sitting out all four preseason games, and Mayfield making headlines for an interview in which he questioned the New York Giants\u2019 decision to select quarterback Daniel Jones in the draft\u2019s first round.\n\nMayfield\u2019s comments weren\u2019t out of character, but seemed unnecessary, and he contacted Jones to clear the air. But the remarks fueled outside opinions of Mayfield, who has been labeled bratty, obnoxious, childish.\n\nMayfield knows he has haters, but he thinks their dislike is unjustified.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s a misconception or that I\u2019m misunderstood,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of a getting to know me and who I am. I\u2019m very blunt, very honest. And if I feel a certain way, most people know it. You can have a first impression, but until you really come to talk to me, you really don\u2019t know me.\n\n\u201cEverybody is guilty of it at some point.\u201d\n\nMayfield chooses his words carefully when discussing how far the Browns will go in 2019. Nothing is given, injuries could derail plans, and Mayfield knows he\u2019ll get everyone\u2019s best shot.\n\nBut the talent is undeniable, and if things go just right, Cleveland, once a pro football dynasty, could be back in the conversation in January.\n\n\u201cYou look at the difference in the roster,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys who have been in winning situations or they really, truly want to win. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in the distance, but he can almost see Cleveland\u2019s celebration.\n\n\u201cMentally, I have a picture prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think this town doesn\u2019t even know what it\u2019s going to be like, and that\u2019s the best part. It\u2019s going to be unbelievable. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The service elevator door slides open and Baker Mayfield politely waits for his wife, Emily, to exit and then follows her down a hallway into the downtown hotel's restaurant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/browns_mayfield_vision_football_85676_c0-140-3354-2095_s1770x1032.jpg?c236d573bb26512ce238ea0ebedcf34fa95bf36c"}
