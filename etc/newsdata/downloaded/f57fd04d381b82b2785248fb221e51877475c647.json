The day before, he made another slip-up when a reporter asked him for his impression of the New Hampshire city of Keene, which Biden accidentally said was in Vermont.\n\nBut some of his mistakes haven\u2019t been as easily forgotten. Less than two weeks ago, The Washington Post reported that he had exaggerated and jumbled key elements of an Afghanistan war story told while campaigning, getting \u201calmost every detail\u201d wrong, according to the paper.\n\nWaving away criticism over his tenuous grasp of the facts, Biden argued in a interview with NPR\u2019s \u201cPolitics Podcast\u201d that aired Tuesday that the \u201cdetails are irrelevant in terms of decision-making.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nBiden Jokes He's 'Not Going Nuts' After Repeated Campaign Trail Gaffes\n\nJoe Biden Says Exaggerating War Story 'Irrelevant' To His Ability To Serve As President\n\nStephen Colbert Asks Joe Biden The Question That's On Everyone\u2019s Mind\n\nLove HuffPost?
