During the past three years, allegations of sexual assault led to the arrest of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, while complaints of harassment prompted PBS to halt its broadcasting of the Charlie Rose show, spurred the ouster of CEO Les Moonves at CBS and led to the resignation of Sen. Al Franken, the Minnesota Democrat. Currently, NBC continues to reel from the fallout of Matt Lauer who has now been accused of rape allegations by a former staffer. Lauer has stated the relationship was consensual.\n\n\u201cI have given a lot of talks, a lot of times, in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response,\u201d the 68-year-old told Bloomberg after the speech. \u201cMostly the audience understands what I am saying.\u201d\n\nWhile using sexual metaphors for deal-making is common, if not always welcome, in private conversations on Wall Street, the difference for Fisher is that he was a headline speaker at a three-day conference of paying guests.\n\n\"It was a true debacle,\" Alex Chalekian, the founder and CEO of advisory firm Lake Avenue Financial, said in a video posted on Twitter. Fisher talked about tripping on hallucinogens, and compared money managers bragging to prospective clients with men showing their genitalia to women they're trying to pick up, he said.\n\n\"When I was listening to all of this stuff, I didn't know if this was a joke or what was going on, I was a deer in headlights,\" he recalled. \"My jaw dropped. So we need to change this -- we need to change it now.\"\n\nTiburon Strategic Advisors, which organized the event, didn't respond to a request for comment from FOX Business.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIt was \"one of the most disgusting and disappointing moments in my career,\" Rachel Robasciotti, the founder of investment manager Robasciotti & Philipson and a member of Fisher's audience, said on Twitter.\n\nAs for Fisher, he speculated to Bloomberg that he's an \"easy guy to dislike\" because of his firm's success and questioned whether future speakers at Tiburon events would be as candid.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "High-profile executives with a reputation for blunt speech face a quandary amid the #MeToo era's heightened sensitivity to sexual innuendo.", "authors": ["James Langford"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Ken-Fisher-GettyImages-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
