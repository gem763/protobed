Their main instrument was the Trump-Russia collusion story that roiled the capital until Special Counsel Robert Mueller pronounced it unfounded. Now they have moved on to one or more \"whistleblower\" complaints from within the intelligence community.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine: Was Trump threatening him or trying to get to the bottom of Russiagate?\n\nGiven all the focus on nefarious Russia, you could be forgiven for missing the fact that Ukraine was always at the center of the Trump-Russia affair.\n\nViewed in this light, the Trump-Ukraine quid pro quo bribery narrative must compete with another explanation: Trump's determination to get to the bottom of an underhanded years-long campaign arrayed against him. One of the first things he did after the Mueller report debunked the collusion narrative was to call the Ukranian president and ask him to help do just that.\n\nThe impeachment battle is not just about congressional probes and alleged presidential strong-arming, but about the Russiagate narrative. Anti-Trump forces in the government and media are working to vindicate their previous efforts and discredit a forthcoming Justice Department inquiry into the origins of Russiagate by again connecting Trump and a foreign power to a U.S. election.\n\nI\u2019ve covered the Trump-Russia story for three years. Even before these operations emerged publicly after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, I doubted the pre-election whisper campaign circulating throughout the Washington press corps that held Trump was clandestinely cooperating with Moscow.\n\nFirst, the idea that Trump had for many years been a Russian ally, even an agent, was hard to believe given that there had been no mention of this during a long career lived entirely in the spotlight. I was especially skeptical of this claim because Trump\u2019s business concerns were based largely in the most media-saturated city in the world, and because they involved industries \u2013 especially real estate and casinos \u2013 that attract the attention of legal authorities.\n\nSecond, candidate Trump\u2019s proposed policies toward Russia were similar to those of the Obama administration \u2013 and would prove tougher after he was elected \u2013 making it hard to see how he was secretly beholden to Moscow.\n\nI was not surprised when the special counsel concluded the story was false. Neither was it surprising, given the amount of money, time, and prestige spent on pushing collusion, to see Russiagate rebooted two weeks ago in the form of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nFamily matters: Joe Biden, right, and his son Hunter at a commemoraton for the Vice President's late son late Beau.\n\nSo far the basic facts are these: An active, and unnamed, CIA officer alleged that Trump had sought information from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding Biden\u2019s involvement in a Ukrainian prosecution possibly involving his son Hunter. In exchange for information that, according to the CIA officer, would assist Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection, the president would release military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAlthough the details are different \u2013 no mention this time of hookers and golden showers \u2013 the whistleblower\u2019s central claim closely resembles the thesis laid out in the anti-Trump dossier compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, which the FBI used as its roadmap to collusion: That Trump took or solicited dirt on his Democratic opponent from a foreign power in exchange for favors to that country\u2019s government.\n\nOnce again, much of the media seem to be treating every allegation against Trump as probable fact, while dismissing any questions and concerns as conspiracy theories.\n\nAttorney General William Barr and President Trump: \u201cOur country has been through a lot,\u201d Trump told President Zelensky. \u201cThey say a lot of it started with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAlthough the whistleblower complaint seems to have emerged quickly, it must be viewed in context of the long war against Trump and its numerous elements tied to Ukraine.\n\nRecent interviews with senior sources on Capitol Hill and newly acquired documents show that Ukraine was and continues to be central to the effort to take down Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s why Trump\u2019s most urgent request of the Ukrainian president was to assist Attorney General William Barr in his investigation of the origins of the FBI\u2019s Trump-Russia probe.\n\n\u201cOur country has been through a lot,\u201d Trump told President Zelensky. \u201cThey say a lot of it started with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThis assertion was not wrong. And yet for all of the foreigners, including Ukrainians, who played roles in Russiagate, this is a story about Americans with the sort of scruples, ambitions, and labyrinthine connections found in a Dostoevsky novel.\n\nOrigins of Clinton-Tied Ukraine Dirt-Digging\n\nIt is significant, in this time of separate, left and right media echo chambers, that an early account of Hillary Clinton campaign efforts to dig up dirt on Team Trump using Ukraine didn\u2019t originate on the right: It was a Politico report by Kenneth P. Vogel and David Stern. (A repeat seems unlikely now: Vogel\u2019s current employer, the New York Times, has dismissed Trump\u2019s claims about Ukraine\u2019s role in Russiagate as part of a right-wing conspiracy theory.)\n\nThe Ukraine story starts no later than March 2016, when Democratic Party operative and Ukrainian-American activist Alexandra Chalupa approached the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington for information on the Trump campaign.\n\nAs John Solomon of The Hill newspaper wrote in May, Chalupa asked Ukrainian diplomats for \u201cevidence that Trump, his organization and [campaign manager Paul] Manafort were Russian assets, working to hurt the U.S. and working with Putin against the U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nChalupa emailed Democratic National Committee officials that she was briefing U.S. media on Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine. One of the journalists was Michael Isikoff of Yahoo News, who would later publish one of the key stories advancing the collusion narrative.\n\nUkraine\u2019s ambassador to Washington told Solomon that Chalupa wanted to approach a member of Congress to initiate hearings on Manafort or arrange for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to comment on Manafort\u2019s alleged Kremlin ties during a visit to Washington.\n\nKeep that in mind when Democrats and their media allies routinely suggest it is treasonous to seek foreign aid during an election.\n\nViktor Yanukovych: close to Paul Manafort. Also, to Joe Biden. Also, to an ally whose energy firm hired Hunter Biden.\n\nAs Chalupa was pursuing these channels, the Clinton campaign stepped up its efforts to find foreign dirt on Trump by hiring the Washington, D.C., firm Fusion GPS that March to compile and distribute opposition research on Trump. One of the company\u2019s co-founders, Glenn Simpson, was a former Wall Street Journal reporter who had written several articles about Manafort\u2019s work for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nIn a 2007 article, Simpson wrote that Yanukovych \u201cfavors closer ties with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nThat view would inform much of the operation to come. It would use Manafort\u2019s close ties to Yanukovych as the kernel of truth from which grew the vast Russiagate conspiracy.\n\nFusion GPS\u2019s most infamous work product was the Steele dossier. But, as I report in my forthcoming book, \u201cThe Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History,\u201d Simpson\u2019s organization compiled at least two separate opposition research documents on Manafort and his Ukraine business, which it shared with journalists starting in spring 2016.\n\nFrom one of at least two opposition research dossiers on Paul Manafort and Ukraine compiled by Fusion GPS.\n\nOne is an eight-page document titled \u201cPaul Manafort \u2013 Ukraine and Lichtenstein,\u201d the other is nine pages, titled \u201cUPDATE \u2013 Paul Manafort.\u201d Links to Ukrainian- and Russian-language Internet portals show that the research was compiled by someone who knew the languages. In October 2015, Fusion GPS had brought on former Russian history professor Nellie Ohr for Trump-Russia research. Ohr\u2019s husband, top Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr, would later help spread Clinton-financed opposition research to the federal government, helping prompt the Trump/Russia collusion probe.\n\nThe documents reference flight records, travel documents, and business agreements while noting Manafort\u2019s relationships with several Ukrainian officials, including Yanukovych\u2019s chief of staff, and oligarchs such as Clinton Foundation donor Victor Pinchuk, described as a \u201cYanukovych booster.\u201d\n\nWithout evidence, one of the dossiers alleges that \u201cthe Russian government played a leading role in promoting the Yanukovych presidency and Manafort worked closely with several Russians during his time in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe other makes the speculative, if ominious-sounding, claim that \u201cManafort\u2019s newfound role as campaign manager to Trump could offer Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin a new way to exert influence on Trump.\u201d\n\nDriving the Manafort-Yanukovych Narrative\n\nEven as Clinton operatives sought the help of Ukrainian officials, they and their allies in the press routinely mischaracterized Yanukovych as pro-Putin, advancing the Russia collusion narrative.\n\nBiden at a Kyiv memorial to protesters, 2014: Later his son Hunter was hired by an ally of the just-exiled President, questionably tarred by Clinton operatives as a Putin stooge.\n\nUkraine is a buffer state, caught between European neighbors to the west and Russia to the east. Its challenge is to balance the two against each other. Failure to do so is apt to lead to conflict, such as the present war between the Kyiv government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAfter Yanukovych became president in 2010, Manafort recommended that he draw closer to the European Union with a trade deal. Putin saw that as a threat, and gave Yanukovych a choice between crippling economic measures and a $15 billion aid package.\n\nUltimately, Yanukovych rejected Manafort\u2019s advice, bowing to Putin in late 2013, touching off protests in the Ukrainian capital that led to deadly violence.\n\nThat turmoil started a new chapter in U.S.-Ukraine relations as the Obama White House made then Vice President Joe Biden the point man on the issue.\n\nBiden had known Yanukovych since 2009 and spoke with him frequently during the crisis.\n\nThe Obama administration, however, had little confidence in Yanukovych. State Department officials on the ground the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, including Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland scrambled to piece together a coalition government. Yanukovych fled his country for sanctuary in Russia in February 2014, just days after his final phone call with Biden, when government snipers killed at least 88 protesters in the capital.\n\nIn April 2014, Biden traveled to Kyiv with a small economic aid package, and warned the Ukrainians to rein in corruption. A month later, his son Hunter was named to the board of Burisma, one of Ukraine\u2019s largest independent energy companies. Although he had no experience in the energy sector, Hunter was paid as much as $50,000 a month for his services.\n\nHere\u2019s where the politics get even more interesting. Burisma\u2019s owner was not a reformer, but an ally of the just-exiled Yanukovych, having served as his minister of natural resources. Despite the Biden family\u2019s financial relationship with the Yanukovych circle, Clinton operatives painted Manafort\u2019s association with Yanukovych as evidence of the Trump campaign\u2019s pro-Putin sentiments.\n\nIn a three-day period at the end of April 2016, for instance, Slate, the Washington Post and Guardian all published articles alleging that Manafort\u2019s work for Yanukovych showed the Trump team was close to Russia.\n\nThis is another reminder of the double-standard that has driven so much media coverage: the eagerness to buy Clinton\u2019s spin on Manafort and then connect Trump to it all while dismissing Biden\u2019s clear conflicts.\n\nClinton Operative Alleges a Ukrainian-Related Quid Pro Quo\n\nIndeed, Manafort\u2019s relationship with Yanukovych became a keystone of the Trump-Russia narrative. A July 18, 2016 Washington Post article, for example, cited it before reporting new \u201cevidence\u201d that the campaign was cozying up to Putin.\n\nPaul Manafort, right, behind Ivanka Trump during a rehearsal at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Next to the future President is Manafort's chief deputy, Rick Gates, later indicted along with his boss.\n\nTrump staffers, according to the article, \u201cstripped out\u201d the Republican National Convention platform\u2019s call for giving Ukraine \u201clethal defensive weapons.\u201d\n\nThat was inaccurate. One GOP delegate proposed an amendment calling for giving lethal aid to Ukraine. The amendment was toned down by a Trump adviser, changing it to \u201cappropriate assistance.\u201d The result was that the amendment was softened but the platform\u2019s position on Ukraine was strengthened. In office, the Trump administration, unlike Obama\u2019s, sent weapons to Kyiv.\n\nThat Post story illustrates the success of the Clinton operation in convincing many media outlets and government agencies to interpret \u2013 and misinterpret \u2013 the Trump campaign through the lens of Russian collusion. This, in turn, erased skepticism they should have had in assessing the charges leveled for Clinton through Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS.\n\nIn a July memo written after the DNC emails had been leaked during the Democrats\u2019 convention, Steele alleged that the operation \u2013 the hack and the release of the emails \u2013 had been orchestrated by the Russians. Then he claimed Moscow had done it with the full knowledge of the Trump campaign. Manafort, Steele falsely claimed, was managing the \u201cwell-developed conspiracy\u201d for the Trump side.\n\nFurther, Steele claimed, in exchange for the DNC hack and subsequent publication of the emails by WikiLeaks, the Trump team had agreed to sideline Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as a campaign issue. This was the Clinton campaign\u2019s first allegation of a Ukraine-related quid pro quo. This was also false.\n\nAs Clinton operatives used Ukraine to falsely smear Trump, Manafort\u2019s ties to that country threw the Trump campaign into disarray. On Aug. 19, 2016, Manafort resigned as campaign manager following what the New York Times and others described as a wave of stories about his \u201cdealings with Russia-aligned leaders.\u201d The Times pushed the larger collusion narrative being spun by Clinton, reporting that the Manafort dismissal \u201cthrew a spotlight on a glaring vulnerability for Mr. Trump: his admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Times story also referenced its earlier article reporting that Manafort received illegal cash payments for his Ukraine work. Manafort denied it.\n\nOne source for the Times story was former Ukrainian parliamentarian Serhiy Leshchenko, also referred to in the whistleblower complaint. According to former Fusion GPS contractor Nellie Ohr, Leshchenko was a source for Fusion GPS as well.\n\nTwo years later, in August 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty to tax and bank fraud connected to his work in the Ukraine undertaken years before he joined the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Steele-Isikoff Nexus\n\nWith Manafort driven from the campaign just two months before the election, Clinton operatives and the FBI zeroed in on another Trump adviser, Carter Page. Once again an alleged Ukraine quid pro quo was at the center of it.\n\nIn July, Steele had alleged that Page was one of Manafort\u2019s \u201cintermediaries\u201d in the \u201cwell-developed conspiracy\u201d between Trump and Russia. The former British spy\u2019s second-hand sources claimed that Page had met secretly with a Russian energy executive.\n\nThe executive, according to Steele, raised with Page the prospect of U.S.-Russia energy cooperation in exchange for dropping sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 for invading Ukraine.\n\nThis second Ukraine-related quid pro quo was the subject of Michael Isikoff\u2019s Sept. 23 Yahoo News article, based on information from Steele, whom Isikoff describes as an anonymous \u201cWestern intelligence source.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, Steele revised his reporting on Page\u2019s meeting for a memo dated Oct. 18. The British spy\u2019s unnamed sources changed their story, contending that the Trump adviser had been offered a bribe if he convinced Trump to drop Ukraine-related sanctions. In a sign of how deeply the media and FBI had accepted the Russiagate hoax, no one seemed to question that laughably large amount of this alleged bribe \u2013 a brokerage fee on a sale of 19% of the Russian oil giant Rosneft, which would have been worth at least tens of millions of dollars.\n\nOn Oct. 21, the FBI obtained a warrant to spy on Page. The still heavily redacted warrant shows that Steele\u2019s account of Page\u2019s meeting with the Russian energy executive to discuss Ukraine sanctions was a key piece of evidence.\n\nAs supporting evidence, the bureau used Isikoff\u2019s article and two other Ukraine-related news reports. One was the July Washington Post story alleging that the Trump campaign had weakened the party\u2019s convention platform. The second article claimed that Trump had softened his support for Ukraine after Page and Manafort joined the campaign.\n\nThis is one reason many consider the Steele dossier to be one of the least credible and most successful pieces of opposition research in U.S. history.\n\nAllegations Tie Up Incoming Trump Team\n\nJohn Brennan: \"High confidence\" Putin had developed a preference for Trump because of his \u201cRussia-friendly positions\u201d on Ukraine.\n\nEven as Clinton tied Trump to Russia and blamed both for hacks of the DNC servers, the Obama administration downplayed Russian interference in the 2016 election so as not to taint Clinton\u2019s widely expected victory. After Trump won, Obama retaliated. In late December, he expelled Russian diplomats, closed their diplomatic facilities, and sanctioned Russia\u2019s military intelligence service (GRU) and four of its senior officers.\n\nA document released the following week showed why the administration had targeted the GRU. According to the January 2017 intelligence community assessment of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections, the GRU was behind the DNC hack.\n\nFurther, then-CIA director John Brennan\u2019s handpicked teams of analysts assessed with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Putin had developed a preference for Trump because of his \u201cRussia-friendly positions\u201d on Ukraine.\n\nDays later, Steele\u2019s reports were made public. According to his sources, the DNC hack was part of a quid pro quo regarding Ukraine.\n\nNow the connections between Trump and the Russians were lit up like a string of holiday lights \u2014 Obama had sanctioned the GRU because of the DNC hack, which the Russians engineered on behalf of the Trump campaign in exchange for sidelining Ukraine as a campaign issue.\n\nRobert Mueller, testifying. His report made no mention of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, or Alexandra Chalupa. It discussed Ukraine only in relation to Manafort and Gates.\n\nThe operation continued to unfold as the FBI and DoJ pursued their counterintelligence probe of Trump and associates, eventually leading to Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel.\n\nMueller\u2019s probe focused almost entirely on Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 election and its possible connections to Trump. He and his team displayed no interest in exploring how Clinton operatives had worked with foreign interests to sway the same election.\n\nStill, Mueller\u2019s report found no evidence of collusion between the Trump circle and Russian officials. The report makes no mention of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, or Alexandra Chalupa. Leshschenko appears only in a footnote. The report discusses Ukraine only in relation to Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates.\n\nNow, the Ukraine Chapter\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s new starring role was still to come. The Intelligence Community\u2019s Inspector General relayed the newly disclosed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint from the CIA analyst to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during a transitional period. Both DNI Dan Coats and Deputy Director Sue Gordon had just resigned when the whistleblower\u2019s complaint reached Acting DNI Joseph Maguire on Aug. 16, his first day on the job.\n\nPreviously, the ICIG\u2019s whistleblower\u2019s form required first-hand knowledge of the reported concern to file a complaint. The updated form, which was \u201crevised after press inquiries\u201d regarding the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, eliminated the requirement of first-hand knowledge. The CIA officer\u2019s complaint appears to provide only hearsay.\n\nAdam Schiff: Apparently already knew of whistleblower complaint before he subpoenaed it.\n\nIn September, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to Maguire to produce the complaint. Yet Schiff apparently already knew its contents. More than two weeks earlier, he\u2019d written on Twitter, \u201cTrump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent.\u201d A New York Times story last week reported that Schiff was briefed by an aide on the substance of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint before it was filed with the ICIG.\n\nIn driving the whistleblower chapter of the Russiagate operation, Schiff reprised the part he played in its earlier chapters. For nearly two years the California congressman filled the media with claims there was more than circumstantial evidence of collusion that would bring down the president.\n\nOn Sept. 13, ODNI\u2019s general counsel wrote Schiff and other leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees that since the whistleblower\u2019s complaint did not deal with intelligence activities or the conduct a member of the intelligence community (i.e., the president is not a member of the IC), it did not find it a matter of urgent concern.\n\nGreg Miller, Washington Post: Whistleblower news was leaked to him and other journalists who earlier shared a Pulitzer Prize relying on similar leaks against Trump about a Russia conspiracy, which proved unfounded.\n\nRegardless, the subject matter, Trump\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign official, was leaked for a Sept. 18 Washington Post story including the bylines of Greg Miller and Ellen Nakashima, two of the reporters who in February 2017 received a seminal leak in the Trump-Russia case, regarding a conversation between Trump\u2019s erstwhile national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe same political operatives and journalists appear throughout the anti-Trump operation, as do the same themes and even the same language.\n\nThe main charge in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2013 that Trump solicited \u201cinterference from a foreign country in the 2020 election\u201d \u2013 echoes the title of the Mueller report, \u201cInvestigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s thesis is identical to the dossier\u2019s: Trump sought dirt on a political rival regarding Ukraine-related issues on a quid pro quo basis.\n\nThe nature of the call to Zelensky so alarmed Trump officials seeking to protect the president, according to the unnamed CIA officer, that they stored the transcript in a secure system usually reserved for programs like covert action. It was a detail contrived to further smear Trump as deceptive, but Trump deputies had begun using the system after his conversations with world leaders were leaked to the press early during the administration.\n\nIn February 2017, the Washington Post\u2019s Miller had the lead byline on a story based on leaks of Trump\u2019s conversations with Australia\u2019s prime minister and Mexico\u2019s president. Six months later, the Post published the entire transcripts of both conversations in another Miller story.\n\nIt was through such national security correspondents that anti-Trump sources -- intelligence officials -- pushed leaks of classified information and other tidbits intended to damage Trump into the media. There it merged with other anti-Trump currents in nearly every corner of the press, where it blossomed into Russiagate.\n\nAfter a nearly two-year investigation, the special counsel found no evidence of collusion. But given the scale of the damage done to the public sphere, clearly something had happened. Among other things, the FBI had put a presidential campaign under surveillance.\n\nIt was logical that Trump, and millions of other Americans, wanted to know the origins of the Russia probe and that the investigative work would be taken up by the Department of Justice. Since DoJ and FBI officials at the highest levels were implicated, it was natural that the attorney general himself would have a hand in the investigation.\n\nThus the panicked clamor coursing through the press at present is not about Joe Biden or his son or Trump\u2019s alleged commerce with foreign powers. Rather, it is the fear that the Russiagate bubble is likely to burst. And the fear that none of the reporters, intelligence officials, and political operatives responsible for pushing the largest and most destructive conspiracy theory in American history will escape the ruin.", "description": "By Lee Smith, RealClearInvestigationsNews AnalysisOctober 7, 2019\nThe impeachment inquiry Democrats launched last month may ultimately hinge on a simple question: Did President Trump try to force a...", "authors": ["Ap Photo Sergei Grits", "Ap Photo Visar Kryeziu", "Ap Photo Alex Brandon", "Youtube Screen Grab Fox News", "Ap Photo Pavel Golovkin", "Ap Photo Efrem Lukatsky", "Ap Photo Evan Vucci", "Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais", "Ap Photo Charles Rex Arbogast", "Washington Post"], "top_image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/49/490347_5_.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
