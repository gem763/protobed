Getty\n\nA defiant Mr Wong accused Beijing of manipulating the elections with \"political censorship and screening\". He said he was the only person disqualified out of more than 1100 candidates for the November 24 polls.\n\nMr Wong earlier argued that he and his electoral party, Demosisto, did not support independence for Hong Kong but backed a non-binding referendum on key issues affecting the city's future.", "description": "Joshua Wong, the face of Hong Kong's protest movement, has been banned from running in next month's local government elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_27/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2422e08b0f207c587056fb03f7ce228f585cb27", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
