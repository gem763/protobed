According to the International Organization for Migration, many are from Nghe An, a poor region in a country that has touted its strong economic growth in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVietnam\u2019s largest province, Nghe An comprises tiny farming and fishing communities that have languished in poverty. Most houses here are squat, bare concrete structures with a few small rooms.\n\nBut there are exceptions: Gated villas with security cameras indicate the homes of families with relatives who made it to Europe, found work and sent money back. These structures, and the stories from successful migrant workers, lead others to attempt the perilous journey.\n\nBut the allure of financial stability can mask the risks involved.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a myth created around going to Europe and the U.S. that may or may not reflect reality,\u201d said Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, an expert on international migration at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research institute.\n\nTu, who has two young children, had taken out a $30,000 loan to build a house for his family in Yen Thanh, his aunt, Nguyen Thi Chin, said in an interview Monday. A friend already in Europe told him he should go there to work and pay off his debt, she added. He took out another $30,000 in debt, borrowing from banks and family members, to fund this effort, his aunt said, and he worked illegally in Romania and then Germany before attempting to enter Britain last week.\n\n\u201cHis friend told him that he should go to England, where he could make $2,600 a month working in a nail salon,\u201d Chin said, a massive sum for someone from this small community where there are few job opportunities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNhung\u2019s brother, Bui Van Diep, said she enjoyed listening to music and chatting with friends on Facebook. He added that his sister had to drop out of high school because her family couldn\u2019t afford it after her father died of cancer in the past couple of years.\n\nHa, who also has two young children, made his way to Europe via air rather than land routes, said his father, Le Minh Tuan.\n\nAll three fell out of contact around the time of the gruesome discovery inside a refrigerated tractor-trailer in an industrial park about 25 miles east of central London.\n\nMore missing people have been reported in Ha Tinh province, which borders Nghe An to the south and is equally economically depressed. While families in Yen Thanh were open to sharing their stories, by Monday afternoon the police in Ha Tinh had told relatives to stop talking to reporters. Plainclothes police also prevented a reporter from speaking to a family believed to be missing one of a pair of twins near Vinh, Nghe An\u2019s largest city.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice in England have not confirmed the identities of any of the victims. Britain on Monday requested help from Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security in identifying four bodies, Reuters reported.\n\nSince the truck was discovered on Thursday, British police have detained four people in connection with the deaths, including the driver of the truck who has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter. Officials are also investigating whether organized crime groups were involved.\n\nMcAuley reported from Paris.\n\nAD", "description": "Three thought to be among the 39 people found dead in a shipping container were from a rural district in an impoverished farming and fishing region of north-central Vietnam.", "authors": ["Michael Tatarski", "James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MtXAekWEhshu1apZA_7PTlDtyrY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PCY5NXZ7MI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
