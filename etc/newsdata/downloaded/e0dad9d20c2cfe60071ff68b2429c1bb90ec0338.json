Eamon Gallagher\n\nBut we wonder: would its 181 per cent surge in FY19 have been a little more bumpy if investors had known the CEO was selling?\n\nBrennan sold 722,155 shares that year to cover a tax bill, a disposal only revealed in the remuneration report. He told us he'd sold \"sometime in April\", meaning those shares would have been worth anywhere from $548,837.80 to $743,819.65.\n\nNo 3Y was filed. In fact, Brennan hasn't filed any change of director interest notices the entire four and a half years he's led the company. Which he can do, because he's not one of its directors.\n\nIt's quite rare for a CEO not to sit on the board, but given how sceptically the market takes insider selling, it does bear distinct advantages for the chiefs of surging stocks who get lumped with large tax bills when their options vest.", "description": "Paul Brennan sold 722,155 shares that year to cover a tax bill, a disposal only revealed in the remuneration report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2436%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_309%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9c23517e40ccfb7f8311a14b4039d8888e5bf210", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
