Get together and make a deal!\"\n\nGM's last major strike, according to the Journal, was in 2007 when 73,000 workers at more than 89 facilities walked off the job for two days.\n\nIn a statement, GM said it was \"disappointing\" that the UAW's leadership had decided to call the strike, saying it had presented a \"strong offer\" in contract negotiations.\n\n\"We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency. Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business,\" it said.\n\nUAW's leadership had previously won overwhelming approval from its rank-and-file for a strike if it became necessary.\n\n- Strong sales, unclear outlook -\n\nWorkers at Ford and Fiat Chrysler agreed to extend their contracts, but GM management was informed Saturday that the union would not extend its contract.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, contract maintenance workers walked off the job at GM plants in Michigan and Ohio in a parallel dispute with contractor Aramark.\n\nGM has enjoyed several years of strong sales, posting $11.8 billion in operating profits last year, prompting union officials to argue it is time to share the wealth with workers who have borne the brunt of downturns.\n\nBut the outlook for GM is less clear, with concerns growing that a recession may be in the offing amid protracted trade tensions.\n\nGM announced last November it was effectively shuttering five plants in North America, including facilities in Michigan and Ohio that were \"unallocated\" for production.\n\nProtecting jobs and saving those plants have been key issues in the negotiations.\n\nIn its response to the strike, GM's management revealed that its offer included a promise of $7 billion in investments that would save or protect 5,400 union jobs and address the issue of the two \"unallocated\" plants.\n\nIt also promised that a new all-electric truck would be built in a US plant.\n\nAdding to the friction is a federal corruption probe of the union leadership, which resulted in an FBI search last month of the home of UAW President Gary Jones.\n\nA member of the UAW's executive board, Vance Pearson, was arrested on Thursday on charges of conspiracy to use union dues for lavish personal expenses.\n\nPearson, a UAW director in St. Louis, Missouri, was accused of using union conferences as a cover to justify long-term stays at luxury resorts in California.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union began a nationwide strike against General Motors on Monday, with some 46,000 members walking off the job after contract talks hit an impasse.
