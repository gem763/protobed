And so Kendall and I, I have this big hallway, and you can hear down the hallway, so we\u2019re screaming out every name, like \"Psalm, get over here!\" like every practice of trying to see what name we liked the best.'\n\n'So Kendall, I was driving her crazy, so I said, \"Let's take a break, let's watch a movie, let's get our nails done\".'\n\nAnd ultimately it was Kylie and Kim who came out on top.\n\n'Kylie and I really vibed on the name, so I think Kendall was more mad that her first choice wasn\u2019t first, and she was hating on Fallon. She loves the name so!'", "description": "Despite it being Kim Kardashian's birthday, the nearly 39-year-old surprised her 10 best friends, including sisters Khloe and Kourtney, with Skims goodie bags.", "authors": ["Annita Katee For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19970668-0-image-a-150_1571615508930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
