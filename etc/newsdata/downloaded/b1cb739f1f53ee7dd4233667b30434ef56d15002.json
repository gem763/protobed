Paul of putting terrorists first, and America second.\n\nHi @RandPaul I know the 2016 race was painful for you since you were such a big loser (then & now) with a dismal 4.5% in Iowa. No surprise since your motto seems to be \u201cTerrorists First, America Second.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a TBT courtesy of @realDonaldTrump. No truer words were ever spoken https://t.co/7MIM31ZuKl \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 12, 2019\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nOne of President Trump's loudest and earliest critics after the report about his cancelled peace talks with Taliban surfaced was Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. The Taliban should be allowed nowhere near Camp David, she insisted, particularly the same week as September 11.\n\nCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11.\n\n\n\nNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\n\nThe President is right to end the talks. \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 8, 2019\n\nA few months earlier the congresswoman questioned Trump's decision not to respond to Iran's downing of an unmanned U.S. drone, calling it a \"serious mistake.\"\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, long a critic of the U.S.'s involvement in wars, told Cheney to cut it out with all her \"NeverTrump warmongering.\"\n\nHi @Liz_Cheney, President @realDonaldTrump hears all your NeverTrump warmongering. We all see your pro-Bolton blather. I\u2019m just grateful for a president who, unlike you, supports stopping these endless wars. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 12, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Paul shared an opinion piece from two of Cheney's fellow Wyoming Republicans who \"respectfully but strongly disagree\" with her foreign policy.\n\n\"We urge Cheney to stop publicly criticizing our Republican commander-in-chief and seemingly pushing the U.S. toward yet another endless war in the Middle East,\" the legislators, State Reps. Jared Olsen and Tyler Lindholm, wrote.\n\nCheney has not completely distanced herself from the president. This week she blasted Democrats for their obsession over impeachment.\n\n\"They have been determined to impeach this president at all costs since he was elected regardless of the Constitution,\" she said Tuesday on Capitol Hill. \"They are fundamentally failing to abide by and live up to their constitutional responsibilities; turning impeachment into an absolutely political endeavor.\"", "description": ".09/12/2019 19:43:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/199/27bf0df1-849c-494b-93a4-4fb1ccf1540b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
