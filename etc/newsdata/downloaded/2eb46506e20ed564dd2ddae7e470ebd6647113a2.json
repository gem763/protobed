The Penguins went 10-2 that season. The two losses that year? To the Blue Hens. One came during the regular season, a 51-45 setback at home. The other a 38-21 loss in the Division II title game.\n\n\u201cYoungstown expected to win the championship,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it done because of Delaware.\u201d\n\nThe stakes won\u2019t be quite as high on Saturday when Narduzzi and the Panthers (2-2) host the Blue Hens (3-1). There are no championships on the line, though any momentum Pitt gained during a euphoric 35-34 upset of UCF last week would vanish if the Panthers can\u2019t carry it forward.\n\nNarduzzi and offensive coordinator Mark Whipple dialed up a play they dubbed \u201cPitt Special\u201d to seal it, a fourth-down call in the final seconds in which wide receiver Austin Mathews found quarterback Kenny Pickett in the end zone for the victory.\n\nA week later, T-Shirts commemorating the aggressive, borderline bonkers play have been sold on the Pitt campus.\n\nThe Blue Hens, now perennial contenders in the Football Championship Subdivision, are coming off a dramatic comeback of their own. Delaware trailed Penn by 14 in the third quarter last weekend, holding on 28-27 after stopping a two-point conversion attempt by the Quakers with 2:24 to go.\n\nThis game is a homecoming of sorts for Blue Hens coach Danny Rocco, who played high school football for his father in Pittsburgh in the late 1970s. The Panthers have had issues with FCS-level opponents during Narduzzi\u2019s four-plus years. Twice Pitt has been taken to the wire by Youngstown State. Victories over Villanova in 2016 and Albany in 2018 have been not-quite blowouts.\n\nAll four games came in season openers. This time the Panthers have had a month to forge an identity, one built on an aggressive defense and an offense that is suddenly pass-happy under Whipple.\n\nHere are more things to look for as Pitt tries wrap up its nonconference schedule in style.\n\nSACK EXCHANGE: Pitt\u2019s defensive line hasn\u2019t missed a beat even with Rashad Weaver and Keyshon Camp done for the season because of injuries. The Panthers are fourth in the country with 18 sacks, with sophomore Jaylen Twyman tied for fourth with 4 1/2. Not bad for a guy who was only pressed into the lineup when Weaver went down during training camp.\n\nARMS RACE: The Panthers have long considered themselves \u201cRB U\u201d thanks to the program\u2019s rich history of producing quality running backs. That\u2019s changing this season. Pitt is second nationally in pass attempts (180), a pace that would shatter Rod Rutherford\u2019s school record of 413 set in 2003. Not that Narduzzi is particularly enamored with that development. If the Panthers are passing, it means they\u2019re not running. And Pitt is 110th nationally on the ground, averaging just 114.5 yards per game.\n\nFLIPPING OUT: Narduzzi is pleased with his team\u2019s progress but is also doing what he can do keep everything in perspective. The season is a month old. Things can change quickly. If given a choice, he\u2019d talk away his players\u2019 phones to avoid scanning social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to maybe see if I can buy them all flip phones,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t look at anything, just flip phone. They can call mom, call your girlfriend. But you can\u2019t go on the internet, can\u2019t go on Twitter. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pat Narduzzi knows the danger of overlooking the Delaware Blue Hens.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/ucf_pittsburgh_football_39217_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
