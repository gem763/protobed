It was imported from Switzerland in 1882 and was once a garden feature for a huge house called Riverholm.\n\nIt was used as the boathouse with Riverholm until 1996 \u2013 but had fallen into disrepair before spatial architect Myck Djurberg bought it in 2012 and got permission to raise the building off the flood plain in 2014.\n\nLooking around his five-floor party palace, one of the stand-out features is the 70ft man-made beach with 40 tonnes of sand that has underfloor heating to recreate the temperature of being on a sunny beach.\n\nThe property has a state-of-the art kitchen that has five Gaggenau fridges. There is also a Swarovski crystal glass door between the dining area and kitchen\n\nIt was imported from Switzerland in 1882 and was once a garden feature for a huge house called Riverholm.

It also has a state-of-the art kitchen that has five Gaggenau fridges.\n\nThe bathroom has two \u00a39,000 copper baths and \u00a318,000 basins made in Italy with marble and 24-karat gold leaf.\n\nThe house, which is a short walk from the Palace, also has more than 600ft of mooring for up to 25 boats and parking for around 20 cars \u2013 which would provide opportunities for private parties and also commercially.\n\nInside is a lush oriental garden with a grated metal floor with a Koi carp pond underneath.\n\nA bridge allows you to see down to the beach party room with a bar, pool table, wine cellar for 1,600 bottles and a stage area.\n\nSpatial architect Myck Djurberg bought it in 2012. He said: 'From the bathroom you get the most beautiful view out but no one can see in'\n\nMr Djurberg got permission to raise the building off the flood plain in 2014\n\nBehind the bar is a secret door to a cinema room and there is an old submarine door that leads to the spa complex with a gym, sauna, steam room and pool.\n\nIn the dining room there is an \u00a380,000 table, encrusted with Swarovski crystals, that seats 18 people, with designer leather chairs. There also is a Swarovski crystal glass door between the dining area and kitchen.\n\nThe room is decorated with four original Battle of Waterloo cannons bought at auction for \u00a37,000 each and lampshades made from \u00a34,000 antique Indian saris.\n\nTwo of the guest bedrooms are designed around a Japanese theme, with 'pod' style beds which have a massage system in them and a built in TV and computer. The house has a surround sound system running through it.\n\nThe house, which is a short walk from Hampton Court Palace, also has more than 600ft of mooring for up to 25 boats and parking for around 20 cars\n\nSleeping quarters: The current owner spent \u00a34.7million completely overhauling the unusual home next to the Thames\n\nThere was a story that the land the chalet was built on was bequeathed by the Prince of Wales - later Edward VII - in payment for a gambling debt, but those with knowledge of the property say this seems unlikely.\n\nHowever, by 1909 it was called O'Hagan's Boathouse, and Edward had a Lord-in-Waiting called Maurice Herbert Towneley-O'Hagan, 3rd Baron O'Hagan \u2013 so it is possible that the legend is at least partly true.\n\nIt is also believed that Baron O'Hagan was imitating the Swiss chalet built as a playhouse at Osborne House in East Cowes on the Isle of Wight for Victoria and Albert's children in 1854.\n\nThe bridge allows you to see down to the beach party room which has a bar, pool table and a wine cellar for 1,600 bottles\n\nTwo of the guest bedrooms are designed around a Japanese theme, with 'pod' style beds which have a massage system in them and a built in TV and computer\n\nIn the dining room there is an \u00a380,000 table, encrusted with Swarovski crystals, that seats 18 people, with designer leather chairs\n\nMr Djurberg said: \u2018The inside of the building looked like council flats when I bought it, it was a total war zone. I'm not what you would call an ordinary architect and I wanted to preserve this special building.\n\n\u2018I think of myself as the custodian of this masterpiece. It's an 1880s building and was a house for entertaining. It's a really gorgeous property but it took me four years to renovate it. This building is one of those real one-offs.\n\n\u2018I wanted to retain that sense of an entertaining house. It's perfect for big parties - we had 120 people here last week. It's got 360-degree views of the river and the park so I wanted to reflect how special it is inside and create something lavish. I decided to make it as grand as possible.\n\n'The kitchen cost \u00a3500,000 alone, the gold basins in the master bedroom en suite were \u00a318,000 each and the baths \u00a39,000 each. From the bathroom you get the most beautiful view out but no one can see in. I designed the bed in the master bedroom myself and the Japanese wallpaper is \u00a3900 for 4 metres.\n\n\u2018The dining room table cost \u00a380,000 and has Swarovski crystals throughout it. In total I've spent \u00a33.3million on the building itself and another \u00a31.4million on the grounds, but I just had to do it justice. I don't think it will be for people to live in all the time, it'll be for someone to show off and have parties.\u2019", "description": "The breathtaking East Molesey property was on the market for \u00a37.5m in 2016.
