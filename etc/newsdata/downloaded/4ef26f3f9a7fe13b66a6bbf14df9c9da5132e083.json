The new elite, Toffler foresaw, would abandon traditional bourgeois values of hard work and family for \u201cmore aesthetic goals, self-fulfillment as well as unbridled hedonism.\u201d Affluence, he observed, \u201cserves as a base from which men begin to strive for post economic goals.\u201d\n\nThe driving force for these changes has been the ascendant clerisy, which, reprising the role that the Church played in medieval times, sees itself as anointed to direct human society, a modern version of the \u201coligarchy of priests and monks whose task it was to propitiate heaven,\u201d in the words of the great French historian of the Middle Ages, Marc Bloch. Traditional clerics remained part of this class but were joined by others\u2014university professors, scientists, public intellectuals, and heads of charitable foundations. This secular portion of society has now essentially replaced the clergy, serving as what German sociologist Max Weber once called society\u2019s \u201cnew legitimizers.\u201d The clerisy spans an ever-growing section of the workforce that largely works outside the market economy\u2014teachers, consultants, lawyers, government workers, and medical professionals. Meantime, positions common among the traditional middle class\u2014small-business owners, workers in basic industries and construction\u2014have dwindled as a share of the job market.\n\nThe educated, affluent class detests President Trump, whom many in the Third Estate support, and has rallied to its preferred candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who emerges from the legal and university communities and voices the progressive rhetoric common to this class. (Warren\u2019s less brainy left-wing rival, Bernie Sanders, fares better among struggling, often younger workers.) Warren\u2019s clerisy supporters represent what French Marxist author Christophe Guilluy calls the \u201cprivileged stratum,\u201d which operates from an assumption of moral superiority that justifies its right to rule. They are the apotheosis of H. G. Wells\u2019s notion of an \u201cemergent class of capable men\u201d that could \u201ctake upon itself the task of \u201ccontrolling and restricting . . . the non-functional masses.\u201d This new elite, Wells predicted, would replace democracy with a \u201chigher organism\u201d of what he called \u201cthe New Republic.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Joel Kotkin", "City-Journal.Org Elites-Against-Western-Civilization"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
