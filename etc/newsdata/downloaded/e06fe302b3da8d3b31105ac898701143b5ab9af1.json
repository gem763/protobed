(Photo by Christopher Furlong,Getty Images)\n\nRBA governor Philip Lowe may have largely endorsed the use of negative interest rates and quantitative easing (QE), but some analysts warn they could have seriously negative effects in Australia.\n\nQE could help artificially pump up house prices, creating a housing bubble as more money flows into the market, according to market researcher IBISWorld. Falling and even negative interest rates would help this, as the cost of borrowing falls and Australians take on more debt to buy a house.\n\nIn the case of a downturn, that could see over-leveraged Australians unable to make their repayments.\n\nQE could also see the Australian dollar \u2013 currently at around 10 year lows \u2013 fall even lower, causing the cost of imported goods to soar.\n\nDespite those risks, the RBA may have no choice \u2013 unless the federal government comes to the stimulus party.\n\nThe diagnosis of an ailing Australian economy is widely accepted, but it\u2019s how to treat it that\u2019s increasingly proving contentious.\n\nDespite unconventional methods, like negative interest rates and quantitative easing (QE), receiving the full endorsement of Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe \u2013 the man ultimately responsible for them \u2013 others remain highly sceptical.\n\nThat\u2019s because having never been tested in Australia, the effect of tools like QE \u2013 where a central bank prints more money in order to purchase government bonds and other safe assets \u2013 is not entirely known.\n\n\u201cThe RBA has stated that it would consider using a QE-style program to inject more money into the economy. Ideally, the recipients of these funds would use them to make greater investments and generate economic activity. However, the effectiveness of this policy in Australia is likely to be limited, given the existing abundance of money supply,\u201d IBISWorld senior analyst Jason Aravanis said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia.\n\nQE and negative interest rates could encourage Australians to make riskier investments and inflate a housing bubble in Australia.\n\nIBISWorld warns a QE program would help push the price of less risky assets up as the RBA buys them, reducing their rate of return, and forcing Australians to take on more risk to get the same results. That could in turn set Australians up for plenty of heartache if the country were to then enter a recession, as the value of riskier assets plummets and their wealth is eroded.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all.\n\n\u201cIt is also possible that these funds will flow into the property market instead. Consequently, this measure risks only further inflating housing prices rather than stimulating the economy,\u201d Aravanis said.\n\nIn other words, QE could more likely create a housing bubble than what the economy really needs: significant growth of jobs, wages, and spending.\n\nThe threat of a housing bubble has already been raised by the RBA itself, with Lowe warning falling interest rates could help create one as the cost of borrowing drops. With the official interest rate at 0.75% currently, and with a prevailing consensus that it will be cut to 0.5% early next year, the RBA nonetheless seems to be throwing caution to the wind.\n\nREAD MORE: Buyers are piling back into the housing market and they\u2019re taking on the debt to prove it \u2014 as home loans spike the most since 2016\n\nREAD MORE: This is what a 0% interest rate would mean for Australia\n\nFurther to that, Lowe has also warned QE and other unconventional tools could be used once the rate hits that benchmark. If rates were to then go negative, that could add more fuel to the fire, although Aravanis does believe they will have a net positive impact on the economy as money moves away from banks into the real economy.\n\nThe value of the Australian dollar could plunge as a result of unconventional monetary policy\n\nThe other major impact of QE is that it would discourage investment in Australia, as investment returns declined. As demand for the Australian dollar decreases \u2013 it\u2019s currently at 10-year lows \u2013 so too will its value. While that\u2019s bad news for Australians looking to travel or buy imported products, it\u2019s generally considered good for the economy by increasing demand for now-cheaper Australian goods.\n\nIn the current economic climate, however, it\u2019s unlikely to help Australia anyway.\n\n\u201cBy depreciating the currency, the RBA would potentially improve export competitiveness and deliver an increase in inflation by making imported goods more expensive. However, this strategy\u2019s effectiveness is predicated on other central banks not seeking to devalue their own currencies,\u201d Aravanis said.\n\nInterest rates around the world.\n\n\u201cGiven that central banks in most of Australia\u2019s major trading partners have also recently cut their cash rates, it is unlikely that this method would deliver economic stimulus,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s because as countries around the world cut their interest rates, the relative value of their currency is lowered. As each currency depreciates at the same time, the advantage of a weak dollar is lost.\n\nREAD MORE: The RBA has admitted further rate cuts will do little to help the economy as global politics takes its toll\n\nThe best stimulus right now would be government stimulus\n\nGiven these arguments, Aravanis joins other economists \u2013 including Lowe himself \u2013 in calling for the government, not the RBA, to spearhead stimulus measures.\n\n\u201cAs the RBA has cut rates closer to zero, it has become evident that the capacity for monetary policy to meaningfully stimulate the economy is now marginal at best. In contrast, expansionary fiscal policy is likely to be far more effective in the current economic climate,\u201d Aravanis said.\n\nWhile the government has remained steadfast in its refusal to sacrifice a budget surplus, economists worry that any surplus it achieves could be short-lived \u2013 or worse, harmful \u2013 to the welfare of the Australian economy.\n\n\u201cIt is an optimal time to ramp up fiscal spending on infrastructure, or offer greater tax breaks to Australian households. With a deteriorating economic climate, it is clear that other policy objectives are more important than simply achieving a budget surplus in 2019-20,\u201d Aravanis said.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government were to conduct fiscal expansion, it would significantly benefit several industries across the economy.\u201d\n\nWith no fiscal stimulus in sight, the RBA looks to be getting impatient.\n\nREAD MORE: The Australian economy is set for its worst year since the 1991 recession \u2014 but don\u2019t expect any Rudd-style cash handouts under this government\n\nREAD MORE: The RBA is now considering the drastic measure of negative interest rates \u2014 meaning you could be paid to borrow money from the bank\n\nREAD MORE: Quantitative easing \u2013 also known as printing money \u2013 is an economic solution for uncertain times\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
