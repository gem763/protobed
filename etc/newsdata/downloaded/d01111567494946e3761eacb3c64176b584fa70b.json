FinFit provided the survey exclusively to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe share of millennial workers saving 2% or more of their income in retirement accounts plunged by 39% from the last half of 2018 to the first half of this year. That figure dropped by 32% among Gen X employees and 22% among baby boomer workers.\n\nMany chose to save much smaller amounts instead during that period. The percentage of those putting 2% or less to retirement tripled or nearly tripled across all three generations, the survey found.\n\nFinFit, which provides financial education benefits to employers and their employees, surveyed 20,000 of its members who predominantly earn between $40,000 and $65,000.\n\nOther metrics in the survey \u2013 total savings, spending versus income, debt levels, and ability to keep up with bills -\u2013 didn\u2019t change markedly from 2018 to this year.\n\nTax refunds play a role\n\nThe survey didn\u2019t ask why workers suddenly curtailed their retirement savings. But based on its interactions with employees, the company found that \u201calmost across the board\u201d many got tax refunds this year that were smaller than anticipated, FinFit President and Founder Dave Kilby told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSome Americans received smaller-than-expected tax refunds because they didn't adjust their paycheck withholdings after the new tax law. More\n\n\n\n\n\nMany expected a refund of about $3,200, but received approximately $800 instead, Kilby said. Overall, the average refund this year was 1.7% lower than the previous year, according to the latest statistics from the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cHaving that cut by 75% is substantial,\u201d Kilby said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the loss of cash flow, but also the emotional and psychological impact of it, especially if people planned for the use of the refunds before they got them.\u201d\n\nThe refund situation likely stemmed from the major overhaul of the tax code.\n\nWhile the vast majority of taxpayers received a tax cut under the new law, less than a fifth of workers adjusted their paycheck withholdings to reflect the changes last year, according to H&R Block. That meant many workers received the majority of their tax savings in their paychecks over the year, resulting in a lower refund at tax time.\n\nKilby doesn\u2019t know how long it will take for workers to recover from the unexpected setback and increase their retirement contributions again. \u201cWill they reverse that course? That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking into,\u201d Kilby said.\n\nUncertainty about the direction of the economy has caused volatility in the stock markets this year.

Millennials\u2019 confidence in the economy and their employment situation dropped by \u201cnot an immense, but a measurable\u201d amount in the first half of 2019 from the latter half of 2018, Kilby said.", "description": "The share of middle-class workers who put 2% or more toward retirement dropped dramatically in 2019, a new survey found.", "authors": ["Janna Herron"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kHGCOprWSNmqFYPklGJt_A--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a98e19f0-eb64-11e9-ae37-bc77e384d04d", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
