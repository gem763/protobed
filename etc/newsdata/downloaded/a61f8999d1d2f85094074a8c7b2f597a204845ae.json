We hope being clear about our positions is helpful.\u201d\n\nThe company weighed in on 11 topics, including support for raising the federal minimum wage, the need to cut carbon emissions to combat climate change, and \u201cfundamental\u201d support for diversity and inclusion in the workforce, as well as the rights of immigrants.\n\nBut critics may have been disappointed by two stances: Amazon\u2019s commitment to continue providing cloud services to energy companies and providing federal, state and local governments with \u201cthe best technology,\u201d apparently including facial-recognition technology.\n\nWhile Amazon has pledged to be 100% carbon neutral by 2040, activists have criticized its work with oil and gas companies, and earlier this year thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos calling for the company to move completely away from fossil fuels and stop making custom platforms for oil and gas exploration.\n\nIn its policy statement, Amazon said that won\u2019t happen. \u201cWe will continue to provide cloud services to companies in the energy industry to make their legacy businesses less carbon intensive and help them accelerate development of renewable energy businesses,\u201d it read. \u201cWe support sustainability programs for our own business, and work with partners to reduce their demand for carbon fuel sources.\u201d\n\nAmazon has also come under fire from employees, artificial-intelligence scholars and civil rights groups for providing facial-recognition technology to law enforcement and immigration agencies, which they say can be misused and is racially biased.\n\n\u201cGovernments at all levels \u2014 federal, state, and local \u2014 should have access to the best technology,\u201d Amazon wrote. \u201cWe will continue to provide U.S. government and law enforcement agencies access to the most advanced technology.\u201d The company urged governments to \u201cwork quickly to put in place a regulatory framework for facial-recognition technology. . . . to ensure it\u2019s used appropriately.\u201d\n\nAmazon also said corporate tax codes should be reformed \u201cto have neither loopholes that permit artificially lower tax rates nor overlaps that cause higher tax rates or redundant taxation.\u201d Earlier this year, it was revealed that despite billions of dollars in profits, Amazon paid no federal taxes for the past two years.\n\nAmazon shares are up 14.5% year to date, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.64% 17% gain this year.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. laid out its official positions on a number of hot-button issues Thursday, and made it clear that it will continue to work with energy...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO553_amazon_ZG_20190731203803.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
