But few expected all the tumblers to fall in place so quickly \u2014 and a lead over the Brewers, too, as the Nats knocked off the Phils, 7-2, on Monday, then swept them Tuesday as the Cubs were losing their seventh straight against the miserable Pirates in Pittsburgh.\n\n[Deal them in: Nats sweep Phillies in doubleheader, clinch NL wild-card spot]\n\nA celebration that was a kind of foregone conclusion suddenly became a Nats Park flash mob event as the team\u2019s magic number fell from three at the beginning of the long day to two then one and finally none after Trea Turner\u2019s grand slam in the nightcap erased a 4-2 deficit and ultimately made a winner of Max Scherzer, who fanned 10.\n\nFew teams have deserved to celebrate a wild-card clinch more than these Nats, who began their season 19-31 but, since then, have gone a scalding 69-38 for exactly four months \u2014 from May 24 to Sept. 24. That winning binge has lumped them with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves as the three hottest teams in the NL over that span.\n\nAs soon as the Nats clear their bleary celebrating heads, they\u2019ll only have eyes for the Brewers. Milwaukee holds the tiebreaker for home field since they won the season series with the Nats, taking four of the six meetings between the teams.\n\n\u201cPretty incredible. We always believed. Now other people see it as well,\u201d said Turner, whose day included a single and two doubles in the opener before he doubled and delivered the decisive blast in the nightcap. His return from 39 games on the injured list with a broken index finger, followed by four months of stellar play coincides with the Nats\u2019 revival.\n\nOn this team full of dugout-dancing home run celebrants, who would be the wildest Nat in a wild-card clinch party? \u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d said Turner, speaking before his clinch heroics. \u201cWe got a ridiculous clubhouse tight now.\u201d\n\nAfter their clinch, every Nats seemed to be in an all-roster dead-heat tie for craziest and happiest.\n\nIn the clubhouse, Nats in goggles, drenched in champagne, formed a circular conga line and sprayed happiness. Looking on were delighted members of the Lerner family. \u201cThat sure happened fast,\u201d said Debra Lerner Cohen. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it!\u201d said her husband Ed.\n\nThe Nats now have five games and six days to figure out how they should approach the team\u2019s first wild-card appearance. Give regulars, especially those who have played every day (Anthony Rendon, Juan Soto and Turner) some rest, a day or two off? Or try to keep pushing to hold that home-field lead on Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to balance it,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019ve fought all year.\u201d\n\nThe biggest remaining decision \u2014 and a tough one \u2014 will be whether to start Scherzer, who has fanned 21 in his past two starts but has a homer-prone 5.16 ERA in September, or Cy Young Award candidate Stephen Strasburg (17-6 with a 3.37 ERA) in the wild card game. Scherzer allowed two homers to Phillies sub Brad Miller on Tuesday, a shocking sight that may make Martinez rethink his statement early on Tuesday that Scherzer was his choice for Oct. 1.\n\nManagers, and those above them, can change minds. Max would have extra rest while Strasburg would be on turn. Debate, loudly, among yourselves. I\u2019m leaning Strasburg.\n\nEntering Tuesday\u2019s nightcap, the Nats had a 68-38 record from May 24 to Sept. 24 \u2014 the same record in that span as the Dodgers and Braves. Run differential in that period: Dodgers plus-187, the Nats plus-167 (by far the two best in the NL) and the Braves plus-97. The Dodgers and Braves are clearly the class of the NL; the Braves reasserted their status by beating the Nats in five of seven games this month.\n\n[Boswell: Nats are in great shape or are a flawed mess. It\u2019s all about perspective.]\n\nBut the Nats, with Scherzer returning to form and Sean Doolittle looking crisp in a scoreless inning Tuesday, are as dangerous an opponent as any team might wish to avoid in a wild-card game or division series.\n\nWhile champagne is all well and good, the Nats have unfinished business the rest of this week. Not deadly serious, but rather important.\n\nEverybody wants a winner-take-all game to be at home \u2014 whether the stats say it matters or not. Fans want to see the game in their own park. Players prefer sleeping in their own beds, avoiding extra airplane flights for Game No. 163. And it\u2019s also nice, with the season in the balance, to know every bounce off the wall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care [where the wild-card game is]. We\u2019ve lost three Game 5s here,\u201d said Turner, who played in the 2016 and \u201917 losses. \u201cYou have to beat somebody good to advance. . . . It\u2019s going to come down to execution, not the ballpark.\u201d\n\nTurner may be right. Since the playoffs expanded to include a one-game wild card in 2012, the road team has an 8-6 record. Five times those wild cards have ended up with identical records and needed a tiebreaker to decide home field. Little good that tiebreaker did them. Only one of five teams got home field that way and won.\n\nWhat truly and absolutely helps in a wild-card game? An ace who pitches like a Hall of Famer when it matters most. Madison Bumgarner started such games for the Giants, both times on the road, in 2014 and 2016. Both times he had four-hit shutouts. Once, the score was still 0-0 entering the ninth. MadBum simply refused to let the Giants lose. In 2014, they won the World Series.\n\nCan Scherzer do something similar? His regular season credentials are even better than Bumgarner\u2019s, and his future spot in the Hall of Fame is every bit as likely, but Scherzer\u2019s October work has been mediocre (4-5, 3.73), including a loss in relief in Game 5 in 2017. So far, Mad Max and MadBum are not to be confused in October. It\u2019s Strasburg who\u2019s had a recent dominant playoff and, in his past seven starts, has a 1.80 ERA, .160 average against, 0.88 WHIP and tons of Ks.\n\nThe Nats and Brewers, on a 16-2 streak despite losing superstar Christian Yelich for the season, may be in better position than their fans understand. One of them is virtually certain to go to the NLDS. Whichever does will probably scare the superior Dodgers half to death. The better baseball team, even a 100-win-or-more team like L.A., has almost no advantage in a five-game series.\n\nIt\u2019s win your bar bet time, again. In the past 20 years, what is the record of the team with the better regular season mark in a five-game division series?\n\nAnswer: 39-39-2. (Twice the teams had the same season record.)\n\nThe Nats illustrated this brutal reality of the division series by having the better record, and home-field advantage, four times in the NLDS. They\u2019re 0-4.\n\nWell, what about teams with 100-plus wins \u2014 the all-around wonderful, virtually flawless teams such as the current Dodgers (100-56). What\u2019s their division series record?\n\nAnswer: 12-12.\n\nThat\u2019s why Scherzer and Doolittle are so important to the Nats\u2019 chances. For weeks, every teammate has wondered whether they could recover from injuries \u2014 Scherzer to his back, Doolittle to his knee, plus perhaps an exhausted arm. Tuesday provided some hints.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made some changes and been feeling good. . . . Really wanted to see how it was going to play,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI was happy with it. . . . I\u2019m starting to get that [arm] extension back [for high fastball spin rates]. We\u2019re starting to miss barrels again . . . get pop-ups . . . use the slider effectively. . . . I\u2019m not proclaiming to be back by any means, but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWell, Sean, \u201cwe\u201d have about seven more days to reach \u201cback\u201d or close to it.\n\n\u201cBaseball is the hardest sport to reach the playoffs,\u201d said Doolittle, meaning the major leagues allow only 10 in the field, fewer than the NFL\u2019s 12 or the 16 in the NBA and NHL. \u201cBut all you need is a ticket to the dance. Once you\u2019re in, anything can happen.\u201d\n\nThe Nats now have their ticket, clutched in their deserving hands. They punched it the hard way \u2014 all by themselves when few thought they could. As for dancing, they\u2019ve been doing that all along.", "description": "Home field for the NL wild-card game would be nice, but making sure their key arms are right is crucial to Washington\u2019s October fortunes.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Tom Boswell Has Been A Washington Post Sports Columnist Since He Started At The Post In As A Copy Aide", "He Spent Years As A General-Assignment Reporter", "Covering Baseball", "Golf", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iVl0R-JMt3yYaUFF3xYMHowKgBo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O3RQQSW7BMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
