REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nLooking to set up a cheap global payment network, Facebook announced plans earlier this year to create the Libra \u201cstablecoin\u201d by next year, spooking global regulators who are now scrambling to come up with the needed regulation.\n\n\u201cGlobal \u2018stablecoin\u2019 initiatives, such as Libra, will prove disruptive in one way or another,\u201d Coeure told a conference in Luxembourg. \u201cThey are the natural result of rapid technological progress, globalisation and shifting consumer preferences.\u201d\n\nWhile regulators have expressed serious concerns about Libra, Coeure noted the attractiveness of such currencies, which could even allow them to compete more effectively with the dollar, something the euro was never able to do.\n\nSuch currencies are directed at retail customers and they are based on existing infrastructure, which would allow them to spread quickly.\n\nFacebook\u2019s aim is to connect Libra to the WhatsApp messaging service, adding a payment leg to an already global application. Such a function would immediately give Libra a global role.\n\n\u201cThe available evidence therefore suggests that transaction and switching costs are much smaller in the case of retail consumer payments than they are for traditional currencies used for wholesale cross-border trade and finance,\u201d Coeure added.\n\n\u201cLibra has undoubtedly been a wake-up call for central banks to strengthen their efforts to improve existing payment systems,\u201d Coeure added.\n\nAuthorities\u2019 response should be to provide faster, cheaper payment services and global cooperation in coming up with the rules for central bank digital money, he said.\n\n\u201cThe next natural step would be for global central banks to join forces and jointly investigate the feasibility of central bank digital currencies based on common technical standards.\u201d", "description": "Digital currencies such as Facebook's Libra will disrupt the financial system, either by forcing central banks to innovate or by grabbing a global role that could challenge the dominance of the dollar, ECB board member Benoit Coeure said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430930069&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1HC", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
