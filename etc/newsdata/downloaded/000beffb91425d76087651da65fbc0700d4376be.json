C-SPAN has started a regular feed on its website of this stakeout spot, located two floors down a spiral staircase in the underground Capitol Visitor Center.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nMany of the images on cable news channels lately have been of reporters catching lawmakers in fleeting moments for comment, or even just a glimpse of an entering or exiting witness. But the relentless pace of the news cycle, with its ever-expanding scope of bombshells related to President Donald Trump, has placed new competitive pressure on journalists to break new details and gather reaction.\n\n\u201cI would say that this is definitely one of the hardest assignments that I\u2019ve had,\u201d said Manu Raju, CNN\u2019s senior congressional correspondent. \u201cThe stakes are so high in this story. If Trump gets impeached, this will only be the third time in history that this has happened.\u201d\n\nHe added that it\u2019s been an environment where \u201cthere is so much interest in what is happening, where every element is so critical, and every thing that a member says is important to the story.\u201d\n\nNancy Cordes, chief congressional correspondent for CBS News, said that \u201cit is an interesting challenge, and the developments are coming so fast and furious that we often find that by 5 PM, we are dramatically altering the piece right up until the moment\u201d it goes on air for CBS Evening News.\n\nThat sudden change in direction is what happened on Thursday.\n\nIn the morning, the story from the Capitol looked to be the closed-door testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. Then Mick Mulvaney gave a press conference at the White House in which he seemingly admitted that there was a quid pro quo to U.S. aid to Ukraine, only to walk it back several hours later. \u201cWe had to make sure we got reaction from lawmakers to that pronouncement,\u201d Cordes said.\n\nStakeouts have been a routine part of reporting on Capitol Hill, but they seemed to increase once Trump took office, Cordes said, as his wild tweets and statements demanded reaction from lawmakers.\n\nJust about six months into Trump\u2019s tenure, some Senate Republicans apparently were so tired of being hounded for comment that they at one point sought to restrict reporters from doing on-camera interviews in Capitol hallways. The media outcry was so great that the new limitations didn\u2019t even last a day.\n\nGiven the intense interest in the impeachment inquiry, media outlets arranged for a pool camera to be placed just outside the House Intelligence restricted area.\n\nC-SPAN decided to carry the feed in part because \u201cthis is the only real visibility that we get into the proceedings on camera at this point,\u201d said Ben O\u2019Connell, C-SPAN\u2019s managing editor.\n\nMost often, the feed carries the image of an empty microphone with a bank of elevators as a backdrop, but O\u2019Connell said that \u201calmost anytime\u201d they have captured figures like House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) or Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, \u201csomebody says something of interest.\u201d\n\nFrom a logistical standpoint, a challenge for reporters has been that the House Intelligence hearing room \u2014 referred to as a \u201cskiff,\u201d or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility \u2014 has multiple entrances and exits.\n\n\u201cWe have a team of people covering the different areas, but the real challenge of that room is that it is designed to sneak people in without being seen,\u201d Raju said. \u201cThere are multiple places that they can go that are far apart from each other.\u201d\n\nThere is not only the stakeout in that below-ground space, but two floors up the spiral stairs to another bank of elevators where lawmakers come and go. Cordes said that it can feel \u201clike a cat and mouse game just to catch a glimpse\u201d of who is arriving or leaving, as she is often pressed to make a judgment call on whether to stay put at one spot or go to another.\n\nSome details of the hearings have leaked, and some witnesses, like Sondland, have released their opening statements. But on the record and on camera, lawmakers are limited in what they can reveal. Witnesses have been unwilling to step before the microphone and say much of anything at all.", "description": "The House's impeachment inquiry has given new importance to what is a part of the culture at the Capitol -- the media stakeout.
