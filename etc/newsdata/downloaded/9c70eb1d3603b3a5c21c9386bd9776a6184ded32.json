Kastrenakes did go through what he called \u201cthe negative facts\u201d of the case.\n\n\"No, he wasn't late. He never showed. Neither that day or any subsequent day until a deputy sheriff served him with a summons to appear ... numerous telephone calls from the Court's chambers and the jury office were never returned,\" the judge\u2019s filing states.\n\n\"He told the Court he overslept and then when he awoke decided not to call or come in because he decided it was not important. The Court found him in contempt and sentenced him,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nThat said, it was clear to the judge about two weeks later that the 21-year-old had changed.\n\n\u201cThe young man in court on October 4th was a vastly different person from the Deandre Somerville who refused to come to court and intentionally violated his oath as a sworn juror,\u201d the judge wrote. Kastrenakes appeared to be moved by Somerville, who he wrote has been \u201ctotally rehabilitated\u201d and went on to extoll his character.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that Deandre Somerville is the type of person who can achieve anything he wants in this world. He is a thoughtful and respectful young man,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote.\n\nRichard Graulich/Palm Beach Post/TNS via Newscom\n\nHe did note that \u201cI do not believe that most individuals would have been redeemed and rehabilitated to the same extent as Mr. Somerville. Upon reflection, that redemption should be immediately rewarded by vacating any finding of contempt.\u201d\n\nIn the order, the judge maintained that \u201cthe Court also knows that it would have punished anyone who behaved the way Mr. Somerville behaved,\u201d but the sentencing prompted outcry and disbelief from the public and criminal justice experts.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., posted a link to an article about the case on Twitter, writing \u201cThis judge put a young black man with no prior arrests in the system for *checks notes* oversleeping. We must reform our criminal justice system, which is designed to criminalize people of color.\u201d\n\nMarc Mauer, the executive director of non-profit group The Sentencing Project, told ABC News that this case appears to be \u201cone of the many ripple effects of mass incarceration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you consider what is the judge trying to accomplish here, it\u2019s hard to see why 10 days in jail would be more effective than just 10 hours of community service. Ten days in jail interrupts his work life, his home life, and all for something that he clearly is now remorseful about,\u201d Mauer said, adding that \u201canecdotally, I\u2019ve never heard of anything like this before.\u201d\n\nABC News' Ella Torres contributed to this report.", "description": "The man who spent 10 days in jail after missing jury duty is now having his record cleared after the judge decided that he was \u201ctotally rehabilitated.\u201d", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/somerville-ap-er-191005_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
