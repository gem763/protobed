Longtime NFL and college coach Bill Callahan, who has been with the team since 2015 as offensive line and assistant head coach, has been named interim head coach.\n\nAllen was of course asked about the status of rookie first-round pick Dwayne Haskins, who has played just 32 snaps thus far, coming on in Week 3 against the New York Giants.\n\nCallahan would make the decision on Haskins playing, Allen said.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCallahan: Not a candidate to start\n\nWashington interim head coach Bill Callahan, center, said rookie Dwayne Haskins isn't a candidate to start the team's next game. (AP)\n\nWell, Callahan has a decision, sort of.\n\nWhile he said he doesn\u2019t yet know who will be starting at quarterback for Washington this week against the Miami Dolphins, he does know that Haskins is not a candidate; the job will go to either Case Keenum or Colt McCoy.\n\nCallahan said the team is checking on Keenum\u2019s health and will decide between he and McCoy.\n\nMcCoy started Washington\u2019s last game, Sunday\u2019s 33-7 thumping at the hands of the New England Patriots.\n\nCallahan added that the coaching staff needs to develop a \u201cpackage of plays\u201d for Haskins that he\u2019s comfortable with and that he knows are \u201chis\u201d before he\u2019s ready to start. Coaches also believe the 15th overall pick needs to get Haskins\u2019 confidence up.\n\nAllen: \u2018We\u2019re excited to have him\u2019\n\nThere have been reports that Gruden did not want Haskins, and that drafting him was either Allen or team owner Daniel Snyder\u2019s preference.\n\nAllen downplayed the notion that Gruden wasn\u2019t a Haskins fan, and said the organization is excited to have him.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re setting the draft board the coaches are involved and they sign off on everything. As far as Dwayne, we\u2019re excited as hell to have him on this football team and we think he has a great future ahead of him,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe\u2019s working very hard, he\u2019s learning the system, and when coach Callahan decides to put him in, he\u2019ll make that decision, but Jay was excited about Dwayne and I think he probably talked to several of you from OTAs and training camp about how well he was doing.\u201d\n\nHaskins said in the days leading up to that Week 4 game with the Giants that he didn\u2019t mind sitting and learning because Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers didn\u2019t start as rookie either, and those are players he\u2019s trying to be like.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Who will start at QB for the Redskins?
