Now he won\u2019t even be held accountable for the illegal possession of the firearm that killed Steinle, unless prosecutors re-try him in a San Francisco, where lives like Steinle\u2019s are increasingly cheap.\n\nHANS VON SPAKOVSKY: CRIMES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WIDESPREAD ACROSS US \u2013 SANCTUARIES SHOULDN\u2019T SHIELD THEM\n\nSteinle\u2019s story gripped the nation after it became clear that Garcia-Zarate had been deported five times and been convicted of seven felonies, yet was allowed to remain in America because of San Francisco\u2019s notorious \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies \u2013 the same policies former Gov. Jerry Brown extended to make California the first \u201csanctuary state.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco County Jail had Garcia-Zarate in custody after an arrest, yet refused to hold him until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents could arrive to remove him from the country.\n\nSan Francisco disregarded ICE\u2019s detainer request and instead released Garcia-Zarate back into the community, a homeless drifter with a criminal past. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nLess than three months after Garcia-Zarate\u2019s release, 32-year-old Kate Steinle lay bleeding to death in her father\u2019s arms on San Francisco\u2019s Pier 14, a bullet shot from a gun in Garcia-Zarate\u2019s hands in her heart.\n\nGarcia-Zarate gave police conflicting accounts of the shooting, initially claiming he stepped on the gun, then that he pulled the trigger. Ultimately the defense theory was an accidental shooting by a man who didn\u2019t know he was holding a gun, but admitted to tossing the gun into the water immediately after the shooting.\n\nBut San Francisco\u2019s destruction of the Steinle family\u2019s peace of mind didn\u2019t end with her death. A San Francisco jury \u2013 despite Garcia-Zarate\u2019s open admission that he handled the gun that ended Kate\u2019s life \u2013 refused to convict him of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or even involuntary manslaughter.\n\nOur system of lawful immigration and our norms of equally applicable law and order are turning into something else, and nobody benefits from the change but those who broke our laws to be here at all.\n\nThe jury bought Garcia-Zarate\u2019s brazen and implausible tale that he found the weapon wrapped in rags under a chair he was sitting in on the pier, and then it accidentally discharged, fatally striking Steinle, without Garcia-Zarate even realizing he held a gun.\n\nThe jury, unaware of Garcia-Zarate\u2019s illegal immigration status and criminal history, convicted him of illegal firearm possession only.\n\nOn Friday, a California appeals court threw out even that consolation conviction, for which Garcia-Zarate had not been sentenced to any additional time in prison, because the judge apparently did not instruct the jury to consider whether Garcia-Zarate may have been unaware that he was even holding a gun when it \u201cjust went off.\u201d\n\nThis unending outrage did not occur in a vacuum. San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors began the modern sanctuary movement in 1985.\n\nThe Steinle family\u2019s senseless tragedy is merely the clearest enunciation of the sanctuary ethos that San Francisco and California\u2019s open-border liberals have subjected Californians to for decades.\n\nThe initial justification for the sanctuary movement in the 1980s was to provide sanctuary for Central Americans fleeing then-prevalent civil wars in the region. Those far-away wars are long over, but the war on justice for victims of sanctuary-harbored killers, drug dealers, murderers and rapists, seems only to escalate.\n\nIn 2017, Gov. Brown committed California to the principles of refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and refusing to ask arrestees about their immigration status.\n\nCalifornia enacted legislation to block towns and counties from informing federal authorities about illegal immigrants in their custody or in government facilities, among other hurdles the law imposes on enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\nSince Steinle\u2019s killer\u2019s acquittal for her death, Ronil Singh, a legal immigrant California policeman working overtime on Christmas night, was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant who should have been deported after either of his two previous arrests.\n\nJust 10 days before Singh\u2019s killing, another illegal immigrant, Gustavo Garcia, began a shooting spree that left two Californians dead and seven wounded. He was arrested two days earlier and should have been delivered up to ICE for removal, but was not, thanks to sanctuary lawlessness.\n\nThe prevention and punishment of crime are fundamental obligations of the government. State and local governments\u2019 obsessive and reflexive defense of illegal immigrants over their own citizens is daily eroding the fundamental social compact between a limited government and its citizens.\n\nHow can the expectation that government will protect individuals from criminals survive when our system is unable to deliver up even the seven-time felon, five-times-deported Garcia-Zarate to federal authorities \u2013 then continues to protect him after he took the life of an innocent woman, and then reverses his gun possession conviction when he admitted he possessed the gun?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf a city government, a state legislature, and a state court system remain committed to the principle that illegal immigration is a positive good and no one \u2013 not even killers \u2013 should be deported, much less held accountable, public trust in even-handed justice is shattered.\n\nOur system of lawful immigration and our norms of equally applicable law and order are turning into something else, and nobody benefits from the change but those who broke our laws to be here at all.\n\nThere is, however, a way back. California\u2019s sanctuary ideology has spread far and wide, but the tide may be turning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMontgomery County, Md., is reportedly considering revising its own California-inspired sanctuary policies after no fewer than seven deportable illegal immigrants were arrested for child sexual assault in the space of six weeks.\n\nToday Kate Steinle\u2019s family faces fresh grief, but all of us should grieve for the loss of our sense of equal justice under law and hope for the return of sanity to our legal system.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HARMEET DHILLON", "description": "With the decision last week by a California appeals court to reverse the conviction of Kate Steinle\u2019s killer on a jury instruction technicality, California\u2019s law-abiding residents are freshly reminded of how cheaply California\u2019s sanctuary state lawmakers value our lives in comparison to the interests of illegal immigrants.", "authors": ["Harmeet Dhillon", "Harmeet K.
