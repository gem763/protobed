It contains major changes to the proposed arrangements that would regulate trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.\n\nThe new proposals focus on maintaining an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland _ the key sticking point to a Brexit deal. The U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.\n\nThe plan has received a mixed response from European leaders and seems to fall far short of meeting their requirements for keeping an open border.\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, said the plan doesn\u2019t give Ireland sufficient guarantees.\n\n\u201cThe first assessment of nearly every member in the Brexit Steering Group was not positive,\u201d he said, adding that the group would flesh out objections Thursday.\n\nJohnson has presented the proposal as a compromise. It would create \u201can all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods including agrifood.\u201d That would keep Northern Ireland in a regulatory zone with the EU for food, agricultural and industrial products, removing the need for checks.\n\nThe U.K. proposal doesn\u2019t put a time limit on that status, though it would have to be renewed every four years by the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, that assembly has been suspended for more than two years by a dispute between the main Unionist and Nationalist power-sharing parties.\n\nUnder the plan, there would still need to be customs checks, but Johnson suggested they could be carried out away from the border at \u201cother points on the supply chain.\u201d\n\nJohnson insists Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, but Parliament has passed a law requiring him to seek an extension if no deal is reached.\n\nJohnson\u2019s position is tenuous because he doesn\u2019t have a working majority in Parliament.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will bring his new Brexit plan to Parliament on Thursday, a day after he presented it to the European Union and received a guarded response.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gregory Katz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/aptopix_britain_politics_38293_c0-138-4650-2849_s1770x1032.jpg?2f6ca6f69c4dfcb66d87ff1f2668ca3528500da6"}
