And the face of the franchise \u2014 and one of the biggest stars in the league \u2014 left with a bad looking injury.\n\nMahomes got the first down but stayed down on the turf. Chiefs players waved for the medical staff to come out. The cart was on its way out when Mahomes got to his feet. He walked off the field, with help, and then walked to the locker room.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 medical staff seemed to be putting his knee back in place after they reached him.\n\nMahomes got a nice hand from the Broncos crowd when he got to his feet, and multiple Broncos players went over to wish him well. The Chiefs ruled him out for the game a few minutes after he left the field.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is out with a knee injury. pic.twitter.com/DKCt1dg9nX \u2014 Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 18, 2019\n\nFox\u2019s Erin Andrews reported that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told her at halftime that Mahomes is \u201cgoing to be OK,\u201d but didn\u2019t give any diagnosis. According to Andrews, Reid also said that Mahomes told the coach, \u201c... I\u2019m going to be fine, Coach.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt appeared Mahomes suffered a dislocated kneecap. If that is the case, there are a couple examples of quarterbacks returning fairly quickly from that injury. In 2008, when Mark Sanchez was at USC, he dislocated his kneecap in practice on Aug. 8. He started USC\u2019s opener on Aug. 30. When Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was a rookie in 2009, he suffered a dislocated kneecap in a game. He missed two more games.\n\nA dislocated kneecap can also require surgery. The extent of Mahomes\u2019 injury likely won\u2019t be known until more tests are done.\n\nMahomes has injured his ankle on multiple occasions this season, the first time coming back in the season opener. He hasn\u2019t yet missed a game with those injuries, though his play has been affected the past couple weeks as he limped around.\n\nMatt Moore took over for Mahomes after the injury. The biggest concern wasn\u2019t for the rest of the game, but if the Chiefs had lost their phenomenal quarterback for a long time.\n\nQuarterback Patrick Mahomes left Thursday night's game with an injury.
