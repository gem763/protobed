(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nAs public education grapples with debilitating budget cuts nationwide, teachers have begun to take advantage of a virtually free, unfettered resource for the classroom expenses they can\u2019t afford: crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and DonorsChoose. But in a move that has confused and angered many educators, some school districts are creating barriers to participate in crowdfunding \u2014 or banning the practice altogether.\n\nTheresa Maynard, an Ohio teacher who asked to be identified with a pseudonym for fear of retaliation, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that teachers in her area were asked to cut their budgets by 30 percent every year, leaving her with just $3 dollars per student for supplies. \u201cIt's unbelievably ridiculous. You can't even buy markers for that much for each student,\u201d Maynard says.\n\nIn order to obtain the supplies she needed to teach, Maynard made a classroom wish list and posted it on her personal social media accounts. But at the start of the school year, she says her school district notified its teachers via email that it would be implementing a stringent policy on crowdfunding, which led her to take the post down.\n\nIn an email obtained by Yahoo Lifestyle, a member of the finance department from the Defiance City School district in Ohio (the region in which Maynard works) outlines a long, rigorous application for teachers who are interested in crowdfunding supplies. Among the 10 required steps are sending a detailed budget, a full supply list and an explanation of how the individual supplies will be used. The email also includes provisions on when teachers can work on the campaign, how their biographical information will appear and the overall \u201cnarrative\u201d that they plan to use for the campaign.\n\n\u201cPostings should in no way state or imply that the funds and/or equipment/supplies received through the crowdfunding campaign are necessary in order for students to be appropriately served and educated,\u201d the email reads. On top of the cumbersome approval process, Maynard says she experienced administrators actively discouraging her and others from crowdfunding, telling them that doing so could be grounds for dismissal.\n\n\u201c[Administrators] told us that basically according to Ohio revised code that crowdfunding in Ohio is illegal for all teachers because of the teaching code of ethics,\u201d says Maynard. \u201cThis action by our school administration is just one more roadblock for a teacher to help provide tools for our classroom that could provide the best learning environments.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle, Defiance City Schools Superintendent Robert Morton disputed Maynard\u2019s claim that she was blocked from crowdfunding. \u201cI don\u2019t know who would do that,\u201d says Morton. \u201cMy suggestion to the administrators was that you have people who have engaged in this without doing the paperwork. Use the crowdfunding pages and do it properly so the school district doesn\u2019t have an audit case ... We just have to make sure we\u2019re doing that in accordance with the law.\u201d Morton says he has already approved a few projects, and that he sees \u201ca lot of potential\u201d for teachers to use it.\n\nFor Maynard, the roadblocks and scare tactics were enough to make her stop crowdfunding entirely. Out of fear that she could lose her job, Maynard deactivated her wish list and deleted the posts. While she says she has the ability to pay for classroom supplies out of pocket, she doesn\u2019t know how many new teachers will be able to afford to do the same.\n\nHer story is one of many. According to a 2018 report from Ohio\u2019s state auditor, 67 school districts in the state alone ban teachers from crowdfunding entirely. But it\u2019s not the only state limiting teachers\u2019 ability to find support. Restrictions have been shared in states like Maryland and Tennessee as well. Metro Nashville Public Schools banned all crowdfunding sites earlier this year, citing fears of educators using crowdfunding to fill their own wallets instead. Other districts expressed concerns about tracking crowdfunding campaigns and donations and potentially creating inequities between classrooms, which was a concern that the administrators at Maynard\u2019s school floated as well.", "description": "As crowdfunding becomes a popular way for teachers to get the missing classroom supplies they need, some districts are banning the practice altogether.", "authors": ["Paulina Cachero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9GMr1UFHJKpxiAsr2jLXGw--~B/aD0xNTEyO3c9MjgwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f3da8f20-e542-11e9-bff7-ab247fad1447"}
