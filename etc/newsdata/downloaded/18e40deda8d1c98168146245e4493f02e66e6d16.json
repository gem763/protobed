Florida risk, Carolinas in cross hairs. Prepare please,\u201d tweeted the Earth Institute\u2019s Andrew Revkin.\n\nInstead of hoping all those in harm\u2019s way stay safe, Campbell retweeted the message saying she\u2019s \u201crooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!\u201d\n\nMany took the former PM to task for her \u201chateful\u201d comment.\n\nWhile she may have only served as prime minister for less than five months after Brian Mulroney resigned in 1993, some pointed out that she still has her hand in Canadian politics, serving as a senior aide to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThis crazy woman - former PM Kim Campbell is a senior aide to Justin Trudeau, in charge of Supreme Court appointments in Canada!\n\n\n\nIs it any wonder why our justice system is going down the toilet???\n\n\n\nMay God grant her wish to come true upon her own family and herself!!! \u2014 Leonard Roxon (@LeonardRoxon) August 30, 2019\n\nWho is Kim Campbell? She seems like an inhuman person. Hoping people die or get hurt is sick. \u2014 SunnyNorm (@PRSunnyNorm) August 30, 2019\n\nWhat the heck is wrong with you. There are real people who live and work there. BUFFS!! \u2014 Carl Souchereau (@SouchMan) August 29, 2019\n\nWishing ill unto others is evil. Get a grip, lady. \u2014 Sylvia (@SylviaGam) August 30, 2019\n\nSooooo, you\u2019re saying you hope the innocent folks working there and live in the surrounding area are subjected to catastrophic event that they can\u2019t control because of politics. Got it.\n\n\n\nRespect for humanity in 2019 has been cancelled. \u2014 William S. (@onehandman) August 29, 2019\n\nCampbell responded to user Carl Souchereau's tweet, writing, \"As there are in Puerto Rico- sorry you don\u2019t get snark- but Trump\u2019s indifference to suffering is intolerable! Wd also help if he tackled climate change which is making hurricanes more destructive! Instead, he will remove limits on methane! Get a grip!\"\n\nAs there are in Puerto Rico- sorry you don\u2019t get snark- but Trump\u2019s indifference to suffering is intolerable!

In 2017, progressives were similarly hoping that Hurricane Irma would destroy the club.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:02:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/53/c800eacb-1aa0-4f24-95b8-c56ae1430ffb.jpg"}
