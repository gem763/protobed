(AP) - Traffic at the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim will be rerouted at times while crews install water pipelines.\n\nThe national park says the work also will mean fewer parking spots.\n\nOfficials say the entry road to the North Rim Lodge will be closed. The detours started Tuesday and will run throughout most of September.\n\nEmployees at the entrance station will let commercial and oversize vehicle drivers know where to park, and flagmen will direct traffic.\n\nThe project includes the installation of 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) of water lines and 60 connections to facilities at the North Rim. The project will continue until the North Rim shuts down for the season in October and will resume in May.\n\nThe Grand Canyon\u2019s South Rim is more popular with tourists.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Traffic at the Grand Canyon's North Rim will be rerouted at times while crews install water pipelines.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
