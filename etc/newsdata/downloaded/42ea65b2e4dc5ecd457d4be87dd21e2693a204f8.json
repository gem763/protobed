Some options include watching a scary puppet show or attending a frightening birthday party.\n\nA warning though: while it may be enticing to want to capture what you see, guests are not allowed to use their phones.\n\n\"With the growing popularity of 'grammable museums,' businesses and consumers are devouring art as a commodity,\" it says on the website for Creep L.A.\n\nHatbox Photography via Haus of Creep\n\nInstead, Creep L.A. wants guests to experience the moment in order to become fully immersed.\n\n\"Art has a life of its own, and it lives and it breathes and it will bite back,\" Childers said.\n\nThe show is provocative, voyeuristic and a little naughty, says Childers.\n\n\"We want people to walk away ... having had an experience of something that they weren't expecting,\" Childers said. \"We want them to walk away feeling, yes, creeped out, but also like, 'Whoa, what was that?'\"\n\nHaus of Creep runs through Nov. 3.", "description": "The Haus of Creep show in Los Angeles features interactive and spooky encounters.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/haus-of-creep-01-ht-jef-191016_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
