When reporters followed up, this what he said:\n\nTonight, a man shot at Columbine HS asked @BetoORourke why he isn't calling for a ban on ALL semiautomatic weapons. Beto offered this to reporters: \"If there's a way to improve what we've proposed, I want to make sure we're reflecting that.\" pic.twitter.com/VIR8eWMz5h \u2014 Ryan Haarer (@RyanHaarer) September 20, 2019\n\nThe question was originally asked by Evan Todd, a survivor of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting. Todd is pro-Second Amendment and asked the question as a way to determine how far Beto would go to infringe on the rights of Americans.\n\nThis is not what happened\n\n\n\nEvan Todd is very pro-Second Amendment and he was testing to see where Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s limits are on his extreme gun control policies https://t.co/ANUhQl0iWJ \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 20, 2019\n\nColumbine survivor asks Beto: isn\u2019t time to ban ALL semiautomatic weapons since ARs don\u2019t commit the most mass murders in US. Beto: ARs Simply aren\u2019t needed for self protection or hunting. \u2014 Ryan Haarer (@RyanHaarer) September 20, 2019\n\nI wanted a clear answer from Beto of where he draws the line, but never got one. To answer my own question on if we should ban guns, the answer is: HELL NO! As far as my stance on guns? The Second Amendment supports me. https://t.co/2W0fPzn0aD \u2014 Evan (@evanmtodd) September 20, 2019\n\nDuring last week's Democratic debate, O'Rourke made his position clear. Now we know his gun confiscation scheme also applies to handguns.", "description": ".09/20/2019 18:38:13PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/7ce64a24-268e-4aae-b1e6-70079a6b628f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
