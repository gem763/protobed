Here are five things you should know about the senator from Massachusetts. USA TODAY\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren is enjoying a remarkable stretch on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Democratic presidential contender drew more than 20,000 to a New York City rally on Monday. She received praise from the crowd and activists at an LGBTQ candidates forum on Friday for starting her remarks by naming all 18 transgender women of color murdered in the U.S. this year. And she capped the week on Saturday by taking the polling lead in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, according to a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll.\n\nBut her success means she now has a target on her back, and some of her 2020 competitors already have begun sharpening the knives.\n\nDemocratic rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sharply criticized Warren in recent days, charging she was avoiding directly answering questions about whether her Medicare for All plan will lead to a tax increase for middle-class Americans\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Biden said in an exchange with a Warren supporter during a campaign event Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cSo if you\u2019re willing to pay, and I respect you \u2026 the extra taxes and you think you\u2019ll get that much more for that, that\u2019s good. But let's at least acknowledge, let's tell Elizabeth (to acknowledge) it's going to cost a lot of money, and she's going to raise people's taxes doing it.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

Nineteen major Democrats are still in the race, vying for attention, support and the opportunity to take on President Trump in the November 2020 general election.\n\nTop of the heap: Elizabeth Warren leads Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders\n\nBig, Big Apple rally: Elizabeth Warren at NYC rally: 'Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh'\n\nThe new Iowa Poll that shows Warren for the first time at the top of the race in the Hawkeye State with support from 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers is just a snapshot of where things stand in the Iowa caucus that is more than 130 days away.\n\nStill, it is an important marker of the state of the race at a moment when more Americans are beginning to pay closer attention to the 2020 election.\n\nIn addition to the Iowa Poll, a series of recent national polls following this month\u2019s debate in Houston showed Warren gaining on the frontrunner Biden, while Sanders is fading.\n\n'Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared'\n\nFor her part, Warren has subtly taken aim at Biden and other lower-tier centrist candidates, who she complains lack vision for the country while too often pressing an argument that only a moderate can beat Trump in a general election.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot at stake in this election and I know people are scared,\u201d Warren told supporters at her New York City speech last week. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backwards.\u201d\n\nThroughout her campaign, Warren has unveiled a series of policy ideas, including providing Americans with universal child care, a plan to cancel student debt and make college free, and a proposal to raise social security payments for all beneficiaries by $200. She has said she will largely pay for her proposals through a 2% tax on families with more than $50 million in annual income.\n\nMore social security money: Elizabeth Warren plans to hike Social Security benefit $200 per month by taxing rich\n\nBut her and Sanders' proposals to expand Medicare would cost more than $30 trillion over the next decade, according to independent analyses.\n\nWhen asked at this month\u2019s debate in Houston by ABC News moderator George Stephanopoulos if her Medicare for All plan would mean a tax hike for middle-class earners, Warren avoided giving a direct answer. She again demurred during a Tuesday appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\n\u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations \u2026 and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down,\u201d Warren responded on Colbert.\n\nAngie Weiland, the Warren supporter from Cedar Rapids who engaged in a back-and-forth with Biden, said that she\u2019s been impressed with the senator\u2019s ideas.\n\nWeiland said she would like Warren to vociferously argue that a tax hike to pay for Medicare for All is worth it by making the case that the benefits \u2013 such as improved health outcomes and ridding businesses of the burden of matching their employees with health care coverage \u2014 will outweigh the costs.\n\nEconomists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst project that a Medicare for All program could reduce the cost of care by about 10% through lower administrative and drug costs.\n\nAnother analysis from the liberal-leaning Urban Institute estimates that households and businesses would see about $21.9 trillion in savings and state and local governments would save more than $4 trillion over the next decade. Still, there would be a $6 trillion gap in new federal spending, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nSanders, who was the first to embrace Medicare for All, has acknowledged that the policy will require a tax hike and set out proposals for how he'd pay for it if elected.\n\n\u201cI think there is room to improve in making the case on how we\u2019d all be better off with Medicare for All,\u201d Weiland said. \u201cI wish she would embrace it like Bernie Sanders has in arguing that the benefits outweigh the costs.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden wears a Beau Biden Foundation hat while speaking at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, in Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday, Sept. 21, 2019.

We need someone who can execute a plan.\u201d\n\nWarren has also repeatedly called for the need for structural change in America and been dismissive of Biden\u2019s focus on restoring pre-Trump norms to Washington.\n\nBut even as Warren has intoned that the country is in crisis and that the \u201ctime for small ideas is over,\u201d other Democratic presidential rivals have countered that Democrats need to remain focused on winning back voters in areas where Trump won but that Obama took in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\u201cIf we want to win and deserve to win, we can't water down our values, and we also can't get so caught up in purity tests that we shut out half the country before we ever get to November,\u201d Buttigieg said in his address at this weekend's Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, a gathering in Des Moines that drew 17 candidates and more than 12,000 attendees. \u201cWe've got to do this together.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks during a campaign stop at Berg Middle School on September 21, 2019 in Newton, Iowa.

Kamala Harris offered thinly-veiled criticism of Warren, who transferred $10 million in reserves from her Senate campaign fund to her presidential war chest.\n\n\"We didn't come in with millions and millions of dollars that we'd raised in 2018,\u201d Lily Adams, Harris' communications director. \u201cWe spent 2018 raising for other candidates.\"\n\nSanders and Warren, two of the most liberal members of the Senate, haven\u2019t criticized each other over the course of the campaign. But last month at a Sanders campaign event in Iowa, the actress and activist Susan Sarandon appeared to take a shot at Warren.\n\n\u201cHe is not someone who used to be a Republican,\u201d Sarandon told the crowd during her introduction of Sanders. Warren was a registered Republican until the mid-1990s.\n\nDancing vs. organizing\n\nWhile her campaign may be surging, Warren took a more low-key approach to this weekend\u2019s Polk County Steak Fry.\n\nBiden marched into the steak fry behind an International Association of Firefighters union fire truck and with a drill team by his side. Harris shimmied her way into the event with her own band and dancers accompanying her.\n\nBut Warren, a former Harvard law school professor, decided to take a more low key yet strategic approach to the gathering that drew thousands of likely caucusgoers to one place.\n\nHer campaign held an organizing event prior to the steak fry where it trained hundreds of supporters and then dispatched them into the event to have conversations about Warren with the huge Democratic crowd. Some carried clipboards and took the opportunity gather emails and phone numbers of attendees that seemed persuadable.\n\nAmong the volunteers were Julie and Jim Maddox, retired teachers from Dubuque, Iowa, who managed to get one person to commit to caucusing for Warren just minutes into their canvass and met a second caucusgoer who was leaning toward Warren and agreed to stay in touch with the couple ahead of the Feb. 3 caucus.\n\nJulie Maddox said that she expects that Warren\u2019s Democratic rivals will step up their criticism that Warren plans are impractical.\n\nBut Maddox said she\u2019s ready with an answer for Warren\u2019s Democratic doubters and critics.\n\n\u201cWe just have to start out by asking for pie in the sky and then we may end up getting a piece of the pie,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cI think the point we have to make is that it could be a significantly more savory piece with Warren than if we stick with the current crowd.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/22/election-2020-elizabeth-warren-rises-becomes-rival-democrats-top-target/2410036001/", "description": "Elizabeth Warren's success means she now has a target on her back, and some of her 2020 competitors already have begun sharpening the knives.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published A.M.
