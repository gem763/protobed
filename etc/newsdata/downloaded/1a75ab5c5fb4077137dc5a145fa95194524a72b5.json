He didn\u2019t attempt a pass in the fourth quarter as Utah (4-1 overall, 1-1 Pac-12) went conservative to claim its first win against the Cougars since 2012.\n\nAnthony Gordon may have set a conference-record nine touchdown passes last week, but it was Huntley who stood out from the get-go. He completed eight of his first 10 passes for two TDs, notwithstanding a wide-open drop in the end zone.\n\nUtah followed the axiom that the best defense against a high-powered offense is to just keep the ball away. The Utes spent 7:40 on the opening drive of the second half and reached the 1-yard-line before settling for a Jadon Redding 28-yard field goal.\n\nAfter Jaylon Johnson\u2019s interception, Derrick Vickers rushed for a seven-yard touchdown, giving Utah a 31-13 lead. The Cougars already seemed to have run out of time.\n\nThe Cougars only managed seven plays for 26 yards in the third quarter as the Utes took control.\n\nThen WSU embarked their own long drive (7:06) in the fourth, but was stopped at the 2-yard-line when Julian Blackmon tackled Max Borghi on fourth down.\n\nAfter becoming the first WSU quarterback to top 400 yards passing in his first four starts, Gordon threw for 229 yards but had two interceptions, including Francis Bernard\u2019s pick with 5:26 to play.\n\nUtah\u2019s defense only allowed one play over 20 yards the entire game.\n\nUtah had 325 yards in first half - averaging 9 yards a play- which was more than the Cougars managed all game. WSU came in with the No. 1 passing attack in the nation at nearly 500 yards a game, but had just 252 yards through the air and just 313 yards of total offense.\n\nSamson Nacua, filling in for leading receiver Britain Covey, had five catches for 90 yards, and Bryan Thompson had four receptions for 111 yards.\n\nThere were whispers that Covey may redshirt as he hasn\u2019t healed fully from offseason knee surgery and has played the maximum of four games.\n\nBorghi had 51 yards rushing and nine catches for 70 yards for the Cougars.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Utes fell nine places after losing to USC, but their stout defense re-emerged to accompany a potent offense. There were many upsets, so Utah doesn\u2019t figure to rise too far.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWashington State: After the astounding collapse against UCLA last week, the defense wasn\u2019t much better Saturday as Utah romped to 526 yards. In addition, Gordon and the offense could never get rolling to try and outscore the Utes.\n\nUtah: Behind the masterful play of Huntley, the Utes didn\u2019t miss Moss much and the defense was sturdy and kept everything in front of them throughout the game. Utah only punted once and played it safe with yet another game ending turnover-free.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington State has a bye next week and then visits Arizona State on Oct. 12.\n\nThe Utes also rest next week and then play at Oregon State on Oct. 12.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tyler Huntley passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more, powering No. 19 Utah over Washington State 38-13 in the rain on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Coles"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/washington_st_utah_footaball_09875_c0-225-5400-3373_s1770x1032.jpg?e7953ede13c32476bc2ea67b2467a6e8f15040b7", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
