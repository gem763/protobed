Granted, we take no joy in such things, but they do help illustrate how fast a company can do a 180 (and not in a good direction).\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nWeWork is a fast-growing unicorn that had its eye on the public markets. It was highly valued and landed huge amounts of venture capital from investors before it filed to go public. But its IPO failed spectacularly, with most of the drama unraveling over the course of September. Let\u2019s take a look:\n\nJanuary 9, 2019\u2013Series H\n\nWeWork raises $1 billion in its Series H round, which was led by Softbank. The new round brings the company\u2019s total funding to $12.8 billion and gives it a valuation of $47 billion.\n\nAugust 14, 2019\u2013 S-1 Filing\n\nThe We Company, as WeWork is now known, files its S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission in its first step to go public. The filing reveals that the company\u2019s revenue has been growing more than 100 percent each year, but that it\u2019s also burning through cash. It also reveals questionable corporate governance practices (e.g. giving CEO Adam Neumann an unbelievable amount of power with votes, letting the CEO\u2019s wife have a say in who would lead the company should Neumann die, the company paying Neumann nearly $6 million to use his trademarked \u201cWe\u201d in its name).\n\nSeptember 5. 2019\u2013Valuation Drops\n\nBloomberg reported that WeWork was targeting a valuation of between $20 billion and $30 billion for its IPO, much less than its last private valuation of $47 billion. The company was planning on kicking off its IPO roadshow as soon as the following week, Bloomberg reported, and was targeting a share sale of $3.5 billion.\n\nSeptember 9, 2019\u2013Pressure from Softbank\n\nFinancial Times reports that Softbank, WeWork\u2019s mega investor, has been pushing the startup to shelve its IPO. WeWork\u2019s corporate governance and viability as a public company has come under scrutiny.\n\nSeptember 13, 2019\u2013Corporate Governance Changes\n\nIn a new regulatory filing, WeWork reveals changes to its corporate governance, including reduction of Neumann\u2019s voting power and taking away the stipulation that his wife could have a say in his replacement should he die.\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\u2013Reports of IPO Delay Until October\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that WeWork would be delaying its IPO until at least October. \u201cThe We Company is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,\u201d WeWork said in a statement after the WSJ report came out. \u201cWe want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.\u201d\n\nSeptember 24, 2019\u2013Layoff Considerations and CEO Steps Down\n\nThe Information reports that WeWork is considering laying off up to 5,000 employees, or a third of its staff, as it looks to save cash. That same day, Neumann steps down as CEO of the company. The exec was heavily criticized shortly before he stepped down for the questionable corporate governance of the company, WeWork\u2019s culture and a report of smoking weed on private planes.\n\n\u201cAs co-founder of WeWork, I am so proud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade \u2026 While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\u201d Neumann said in a statement.\n\nSeptember 30, 2019\u2013WeWork Delays IPO Indefinitely\n\nThe company announces that it plans to eventually go public but is delaying its IPO indefinitely.\n\nWeWork has \u201cevery intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future,\u201d new co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham said in a statement.\n\nWhat Does This Mean\n\nAnd such is life for this former startup superstar. Whether the company can fully clean up this mess, put a failed IPO in the past and successfully debut on the public markets in the future is unclear. But if the future is anything like the recent past, then we won\u2019t be surprised if a timeline update looks grim.\n\nIllustration Credit: Li-Anne Dias", "description": "", "authors": ["Sophia Kunthara"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/crashing_ipo.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
