It puts the regulator in a position to make adjustments after the fact, if the assumptions that the initial tariff decision were based on played out differently in reality.\n\n\n\nIn the founding affidavit by Cassim, Eskom had argued that Nersa made a variety of errors.\n\nNersa penalised Eskom for load shedding, which it believed could have been prevented, but almost R14 billion was subtracted twice, said Eskom.\n\nIn addition, Nersa allegedly incorrectly recorded an amount of R1.2 billion as R1.7 billion and turned down a further R13 billion because Eskom did not supply supporting affidavits.\n\nEskom, however, attached the email in which the information was sent to various Nersa officials to the court papers.\n\nSince then Eskom had, with much difficulty, obtained the record of Nersa\u2019s decisions, which include recordings of meetings that preceded the decisions.\n\nIn a supplementary affidavit, Cassim said the record \u2013 which is still not nearly complete \u2013 confirmed Eskom\u2019s previous arguments that Nersa had messed up and that the decisions should therefore be set aside.\n\nCassim said Nersa had had more than enough time since February to supply the complete record and the fact that it had not done so, despite various requests, created the impression the documents were being withheld because they would negatively affect Nersa\u2019s case.\n\nRead: Eskom price hike will squeeze consumers\n\nThe missing documents include a report from consultants PwC, which the decision-makers discussed; a letter from the former minister of energy, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane; and the minutes of a meeting between her and Nersa.\n\nCassim said it was impossible to understand from the record how Nersa had arrived at the figures it approved.\n\nNersa\u2019s entire approach was incorrect, said Cassim.\n\nInstead of keeping to the prescribed methodology and following principles it had laid down in previous judgments, Nersa tried to \u201cpunish\u201d Eskom.\n\n\u201cThis is seemingly one of the main principles Nersa applied in its decision-making [despite the fact that it is not provided for in the methodology],\u201d he said.\n\nCassim said the record also confirmed that Nersa unnecessarily delayed making decisions, gave no consideration to Eskom\u2019s repeated pleas about its weakening financial position and the necessity of obtaining the outstanding amounts.\n\nHe said Nersa erred further by doing an economic impact study which influenced its decision.\n\nThis was not authorised by the prescribed methodology, except in a subsequent decision on when power tariffs should be increased to recover amounts that had already been determined from consumers.\n\nNersa has yet to file papers.\n\nThe case is expected to be heard early next year.", "description": "Eskom has accused energy regulator Nersa of trying to punish it in earlier decisions on electricity tariff increases.", "authors": ["Antoinette Slabbert"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9016/372e5ee43f234879b8011c56fde716cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
