REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nWarren said on Friday she raised $24.6 million during the third quarter, up from $19.1 million between April and June.\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has been rising recently in opinion polls and last week edged past former Vice President Joe Biden for the first time in a major national opinion poll.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in,\u201d Warren said on Twitter.\n\nHer take during the third quarter will probably be the second largest among the 19 Democrats seeking the party\u2019s nomination. Of the candidates who have reported fundraising during the quarter, only Bernie Sanders raised more, taking in $25.3 million. Biden raised $15.2 million.\n\nFundraising numbers are closely watched to assess whether campaigns are collecting the cash needed to be competitive. Campaigns must file detailed fundraising reports for the third quarter to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee as he seeks re-election, announced that he and the Republican National Committee (RNC) jointly raised $125 million in the third quarter.\n\nWarren\u2019s announcement of a sizable haul means the top nine Democrats to report their totals for the quarter collectively raised more then $116 million. The RNC is allowed to accept donations up to $35,000, while Democratic candidates are limited to donations of $2,800.\n\nEarlier this year, Warren went a step farther than her rivals who have mostly refused to take money from corporate lobbyists, and swore off conducting high-dollar fundraisers. She has raised nearly all of her money through online donations.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign manager, Roger Lau, said the money raised will help fund a digital and television advertising campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also growing our team in states that will have primaries and caucuses in March,\u201d Lau said in an online post. Warren hired the largest staff out the gate, amassing a sizable payroll.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign reported she received more than 940,000 donations from over 500,000 different donors, Lau said. Of those, 60% donated for the first time in the third quarter.", "description": "U.S. presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren stepped up her fundraising between July and September in another sign her campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination is gathering steam.", "authors": ["Jason Lange", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437069008&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9316A", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
