Scientists described the trial results as a breakthrough.\n\nExoskeleton suits: can 'superhuman' frames cross into the mainstream?

Four years ago his life was permanently changed when he fell 40ft (12 metres) from a balcony, severing his spinal cord and leaving him paralysed from the shoulders down.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in my position, when you can\u2019t do anything with your body \u2026 I wanted to do something with my brain,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nHe trained using a video game avatar system to acquire the skills needed to operate the exoskeleton and had to relearn natural movements from scratch. \u201cI can\u2019t go home tomorrow in my exoskeleton but I\u2019ve got to a point where I can walk. I walk when I want and I stop when I want,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nCervical spinal cord injuries leave about 20% of patients paralysed in all four limbs and is the most severe injury of its kind.\n\nAlim Louis Benabid, professor emeritus at Grenoble and lead author of the study published in the Lancet Neurology journal, said: \u201cThe brain is still capable of generating commands that would normally move the arms and legs, there\u2019s just nothing to carry them out.\u201d\n\nA team of experts from Grenoble Alpes hospital, the biomedical company Cinatech and the CEA research centre began the procedure by implanting two recording devices either side of Thibault\u2019s head, between the brain and the skin. These read his sensorimotor cortex, which controls motor function.\n\nEach decoder transmits brain signals, which are translated by an algorithm into the movements the patient has thought about. It is this system that sends the physical commands the exoskeleton executes.\n\nThibault used the avatar and video game to think about performing physical tasks such as walking and reaching out to touch objects. Using the avatar, video game and exoskeleton combined, he was able to cover the length of one and a half football pitches over the course of many sessions.\n\nSeveral studies have used implants to stimulate patients\u2019 muscles but the Grenoble research is the first to use brain signals to control a robot exoskeleton.\n\nExperts involved in the study said it could potentially lead to brain-controlled wheelchairs for paralysed patients. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about turning man into machine but about responding to a medical problem,\u201d said Benabid. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about \u2018repaired man\u2019, not \u2018augmented man\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn a comment piece on the study, Tom Shakespeare, professor of disability research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the exoskeleton system was a long way from usable clinical possibility.\n\nBut Thibault said the trial offered a \u201cmessage of hope to people like me \u2026 This is possible, even with our handicap.\u201d", "description": "French patient\u2019s breakthrough could lead to brain-controlled wheelchairs, say experts", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52d528eef9e1c46b1bf24f7c891063f78fc160d/0_0_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4ac131e969665d0ce0a83880d338cd9", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
