Republican to run the hard way", "language": "en", "text": "The misstep has been a setback for Republicans in a year when they cannot afford to lose a single seat. Control of the General Assembly is up for grabs, with all 140 seats on the ballot and the GOP defending a 51-48 majority in the House and a 20-19 edge in the Senate, with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA write-in candidate has not won in Virginia for a generation. The last time was in 1989, when independent Jackie Stump, president of the local coal miners\u2019 union in far southwest Virginia, pulled one off in the midst of a bitter strike to win a House of Delegates seat.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for the guy, but he didn\u2019t care enough to make sure the forms were filled out,\u201d said Ridgeway, 67, a former teacher and juvenile probation officer.\n\nFreitas\u2019s flub is not considered likely to cost him reelection given the bright red nature of the district, which covers Madison and Orange counties, and part of Culpeper. But it is forcing Freitas, 40, to spend more time and money on the campaign than planned. The episode could also cost him political capital with his own party at a time when he is widely thought to have his eye on higher office, including a possible challenge to Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFreitas spoke at a recent anti-impeachment rally outside Spanberger\u2019s Henrico County office but said that was to support Trump, not to signal his interest in a congressional bid.\n\n\u201cI am entirely focused on my House of Delegates race,\u201d said Freitas, a defense consultant who served in the Army in Iraq on two combat tours.\n\nHe promised to raise all of the money he needs for the write-in bid without help from the House Republican Caucus, so he would not be a drain on GOP resources. Richard Uihlein, a GOP megadonor from Illinois, has bankrolled the bulk of his campaign with a $500,000 donation, some of which Freitas has shared with other legislative candidates.\n\nAD\n\nUihlein, who typically shuns the spotlight, did not respond to messages seeking comment. The shipping supplies mogul, a prolific donor during the 2018 midterms, tends to support candidates who share his opposition to unions and affinity for free markets and small government.\n\nAD\n\nFreitas has vastly outraised Ridgeway, having pulled in $688,000 since January. He had $170,000 on hand heading into October. She has raised $80,000 and had $38,000 in cash.\n\n\u201cNick is only alive because of Rich Uihlein\u2019s money,\u201d Jake Rubenstein, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, said in an email. \u201cYou might as well write in U-I-H-L-E-I-N if you want to vote for Nick.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMuch of the GOP establishment rallied around Freitas last year as he battled Republican Corey A. Stewart for their party\u2019s U.S. Senate nomination. With Stewart embracing Confederate heritage and engaging in Trump\u00adian antics, some Republicans saw Freitas as a fresh face who could help re-brand a party that had not won a statewide election for a decade.\n\nFreitas narrowly lost the nomination to Stewart, who went on to get clobbered in the general election by Sen. Tim Kaine (D).\n\nAD\n\nWith no primary challenger for his House seat, the delegate began 2019 seemingly poised to play an outsize role in legislative elections. Breaking with protocol, he waded into a bitter nomination battle between a Republican colleague, Del. Christopher K. Peace (Hanover), and the challenger who ultimately beat him, Scott Wyatt. Freitas\u2019s wife, Tina Freitas, mounted a GOP primary challenge against Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (Augusta). She was soundly defeated.\n\nAD\n\nAmid all that, state elections officials said Freitas\u2019s local Republican legislative committee never submitted a required form indicating he was the party\u2019s nominee. The state said a second form, which Freitas personally should have filed, also was missing.\n\nBruce Kay, chairman of the GOP\u2019s 30th legislative district, said at the time that he had emailed the nomination form to an outdated address. He said he could not provide a copy of his email as proof because of a computer glitch.\n\nAD\n\nCommittees for two other delegate candidates \u2014 one Republican, one Democrat \u2014 said they had similar problems but at least one produced a copy of an errant email, and both of those candidates had submitted the second form. The elections board agreed to list those two on the ballot but said Freitas\u2019s case was different because both forms were missing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaybe he should have spent less time trying to create a family political business or meddling in his colleagues races,\u201d Peace tweeted in the summer while Freitas\u2019s ballot troubles began unfolding.\n\nAs Freitas considered how to get his name on the ballot, rifts with party leaders opened in public. A former Freitas aide tangled on Facebook with House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), accusing GOP leaders of not supporting Freitas.\n\n\u201cOh YOU must be the mastermind behind the scenes who would rather run a write-in campaign than try to get a Republican on the ballot in an otherwise safe district when control of the state government is at stake,\u201d Gilbert shot back. \u201cShame on me?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut party leaders soon lined up behind Freitas.\n\n\u201cNick recognizes what he has to do to be successful on November 5th and has put together a top-notch team to help us hold the majority,\u201d Gilbert said in a written statement this week. \u201cThe 30th House district knows Nick, and he\u2019s a great fit for it. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that he\u2019s headed back to Richmond in January.\u201d\n\nFreitas is running for reelection in a rural district where Trump beat Hillary Clinton 61 percent to 34 percent \u2014 despite losing the state overall by six points. Two years ago, as Democrats picked up 15 House seats in an anti-Trump wave, Freitas beat Democratic challenger Ben Hixon 62 percent to 38 percent, despite being outspent nearly 2 to 1.\n\nAD\n\nBut a write-in campaign presents special challenges. Freitas has sought advice from part of the team that helped Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) win a write-in bid in 2010.\n\nAD\n\nHis billboards, mailers and volunteers focus on the nitty-gritty of casting a write-in ballot. Voters must write his name \u2014 spelling need not be perfect \u2014 and fill in a bubble beside the words \u201cwrite-in.\u201d The vote won\u2019t count if the bubble isn\u2019t filled in, unless there\u2019s a recount.\n\nFreitas said he\u2019s undaunted: \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight all the way until the polls close.\u201d\n\nIn mailings, he blames his predicament on politics \u2014 something even the lone Republican on the three-member state elections board has disputed.\n\n\u201cDemocrat-appointed bureaucrats in Richmond kept Republican nominee Nick Freitas off the ballot in order to help Democrats flip the House and take total control of Virginia government,\u201d one reads. \u201cThey\u2019ve limited your choice on the ballot in an effort to elect the radical Democrat nominee.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRidgeway, who lives on a farm in Madison, said she is surprised to see herself described as a \u201cradical.\u201d A political newcomer and daughter of an Episcopal minister, she wants to expand mental health services and rural broadband, and improve schools. She says both parties need to compromise on certain flash points, such as guns and abortion.\n\n\u201cI think reds and blues have to work together,\u201d she said.\n\nOn guns, she wants criminal background checks for all purchases and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow authorities to temporarily seize firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in confiscation,\u201d she said. \u201cI live in the country. We have rabid animals. Guns are something that you have.\u201d\n\nOn abortion, she thinks the procedure should be legal in the first trimester but an option later in pregnancy only for medical reasons, such as if the mother\u2019s life is in danger or the fetus is not viable.\n\n\u201cI had seven miscarriages. I\u2019ve had a lot of loss in my life,\u201d said Ridgeway, who has two grown daughters but lost a son at age 6 in a car accident. \u201cI respect the concept of life and I know how precious life is. And I know how quickly it can end.\u201d\n\nFreitas, who has three young children, sometimes invokes the sacrifices made by his mother when discussing his opposition to abortion. She got pregnant in college and dropped out to have him.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what it is like to be a young woman that finds herself in a situation that she did not anticipate, that is now going to drastically alter her life,\u201d he said during a September speech in Austin. \u201cI have no idea what it\u2019s like to be that woman. I do know what it\u2019s like to be her son.\u201d\n\nMore often, he strikes a harder tone, railing against the \u201cabortion industry\u201d or saying Democrats cannot be trusted not to turn \u201cred-flag\u201d laws into a \u201cmassive power grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time Democrats infringed on essential liberties for political purposes?\u201d he asked, sarcastically, in the Texas speech. \u201cI mean other than, like, slavery, fighting against women\u2019s suffrage, Japanese internment camps, segregation, massive resistance, Jim Crow laws \u2014 other than those?\n\nThe speech was one of five unpaid appearances he has made since April at gatherings around the country of Young Americans for Liberty, the libertarian equivalent to College Republicans and an offshoot of the 2008 presidential campaign by then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.).\n\nFreitas came to the attention of Young Americans for Liberty last year during his U.S. Senate bid.\n\nNow Freitas is a regular keynote speaker at YAL conventions, usually paired with Paul; Paul\u2019s son, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.); or a key ally of the Pauls, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.).\n\nCliff Maloney Jr., the group\u2019s president, said Freitas\u2019s \u201celectric keynote address\u201d has been a staple of its gatherings. \u201cFrom his experience on the battlefield to his rigorous defense of personal liberty . . . he is dynamite,\u201d Maloney said.\n\nFreitas went to Philadelphia for one convention in the spring, during his wife\u2019s primary battle. The others took him to Memphis, San Jose, Austin and Detroit in the summer and fall, after his fate as a write-in candidate had been sealed.\n\nSome Republicans have grumbled about Freitas\u2019s time off the trail. Freitas agreed to the appearances before he knew he would have to run as a write-in, campaign manager Joe Desilets said.\n\nBounding onto the stage in Austin in jeans, a blazer and cowboy boots, Freitas gave a lesson on how to shut down arguments for gun control with blunt one-liners.\n\nTo the Democrat who suggests, \u201cIf you need 30 rounds to hunt, you suck at hunting,\u201d Freitas had a comeback: \u201cWell if you need an unarmed populace to govern, you suck at governing.\u201d\n\nTo those who\u2019d claim \u201cnobody needs an AR-15,\u201d he had a retort invoking the Democratic presidential contender and former congressman from Texas who is calling for a mandatory buyback for assault weapons.", "description": "Del.
