The company announced on Monday an updated list of 21 firms that are still committed to backing and overseeing Libra.\n\nDavid Marcus, the chief executive behind Libra, attempted to soothe regulators concerns about the currency during a Senate hearing in July. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also scheduled to testify in front of Congress on October 23 to further address concerns about Libra.\n\nRBC believes many companies are still very interested in joining Libra and the firm\u2019s that left may return given the right circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf a clear regulatory roadmap is developed and Libra launches successfully, we would not be surprised to see these firms reapply to the association,\u201d RBC said.\n\nRead more: The chief strategist at a $US1.3 trillion brokerage breaks down how traders are using Roku as a pawn in the great streaming wars\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
