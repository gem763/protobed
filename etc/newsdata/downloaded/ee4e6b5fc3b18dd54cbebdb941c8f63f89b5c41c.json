Goodenough of the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nGoran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the prize was about \u201ca rechargeable world.\u201d In a statement, the committee said lithium-ion batteries \u201chave revolutionized our lives\u201d \u2014 and the laureates \u201claid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel committee said the lithium-ion battery has its roots in the oil crisis in the 1970s, when Whittingham was working to develop methods aimed at leading to fossil fuel-free energy technologies.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\u201d\n\nTwo literature laureates are to be announced Thursday, because last year\u2019s award was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "John B. Goodenough, M.
