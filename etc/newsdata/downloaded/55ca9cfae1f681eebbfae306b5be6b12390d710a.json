We think that the 10-year yield will rise once more in 2020, even as the US economy slows a bit further and relations with China deteriorate again.\"\n\nToday's agenda\n\nLocal: RBA board meeting minutes October; NZ net migration August\n\nOverseas data: China PPI and CPI September; Japan industrial production August; UK ILO unemployment rate August; US NY Empire manufacturing October; US Federal Reserve's James Bullard speech; Euro zone ZEW expectations October\n\nMarket highlights\n\nASX futures down 21 points or -0.3% to 6602 near 4.03am AEDT\n\nAUD -0.1% to 6777 US cents\n\nOn Wall St: Dow +0.1% S &P 500 flat Nasdaq -0.1% at 3.59am AEDT\n\nIn New York: BHP -1.7% Rio -1.5% Atlassian +0.2%\n\nIn Europe: Stoxx 50 -0.4% FTSE -0.5% CAC -0.4% DAX -0.2%\n\nSpot gold +0.3% to $US1493.36 an ounce at 12.18pm New York time\n\nBrent crude -2.7% to $US58.84 a barrel\n\nUS oil -2.8% to $US53.17 a barrel\n\nIron ore -2.4% to $US91.49 a tonne\n\nDalian iron ore -3.2% to 630.50 yuan\n\nLME aluminium -0.4% to $US1715 a tonne\n\nLME copper -0.8% to $US5750 a tonne\n\n2-year yield: US 1.59% Australia 0.70%\n\n5-year yield: US 1.55% Australia 0.72%\n\n10-year yield: US 1.73% Australia 1.04% Germany -0.46%\n\n10-year US/Australia yield gap: 69 basis points\n\nFrom today's Financial Review\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBank bashing could drive up rates, says Westpac: The bank has warned that a political pile-on could result in the loss of its AA credit rating, as the government plays down expectations of its ACCC inquiry.\n\nNIMs ain't NIMS in a post-Hayne world: ACCC boss Rod Sims will need to become nimble with NIMs as he investigates allegations the banks are shortchanging their loyal customers on interest rates.\n\nASIC takes aim at financial 'sludge': Heralding an era of greater intervention, ASIC will force companies to ditch products that are too complex and treat customers fairly.\n\nUnited States\n\nUS stocks stalled after three straight sessions of gains as a bare-bones trade deal with China announced on Friday dampened sentiment and triggered a 2 per cent drop in oil prices, ahead of the start of third-quarter earnings season.\n\nOil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the biggest drags on the S &P 500 index, as oil prices gave up last week's gains on growing concerns that the partial trade deal could take time to be sealed.\n\nThe S &P 500 and Dow Jones indexes ended Friday with their first weekly gain in a month after Washington signaled the two sides had taken a major step in easing the tit-for-tat measures that have hammered global growth this year.\n\nBut the absence of details left investors feeling less upbeat about what had really been achieved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Investors are trying to wrap their head around this 'non deal',\" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York.\n\n\"If [the market] was really skeptical, it would be selling off a lot harder. But it's not because there are some good points to it: that they are still talking and potentially reaching a deal.\"\n\nEurope\n\nA three-day rally in European shares came to a halt on Monday. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.5 per cent, but erased nearly half of losses made earlier in the session as defensive sectors gained some favour and automakers rose.\n\nLondon-listed companies with exposure to the domestic economy retreated as last week's euphoric optimism gave way to doubts over whether a timely Brexit deal could be clinched, while cybersecurity firm Sophos surged 36 per cent after a buyout offer.\n\nThe FTSE 250 ended slightly off the day's lows but still shed 0.6 per cent, handing back part of the more than 4 per cent gain it had recorded in the previous session which was its best in nearly a decade.\n\nAsia\n\nHong Kong stocks rose but the gains were capped by doubts over the durability of a partial preliminary deal, and lingering worries about China's economy. The Hang Seng index rose 0.8 per cent while the China Enterprises Index gained 0.5 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 per cent to and Seoul's Kospi added 1.2 per cent. Tokyo's stock exchange was closed for a public holiday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors now wait for a slew of economic data this week, including GDP growth, inflation and industrial output for further clues about the Chinese economy. JP Morgan Asset Management's chief market strategist Asia, Tai Hui, said that, although the tentative trade deal \"should support risk appetite in the near-term, be positive for equities and tighten corporate credit spreads ... market optimism may not be well supported by economic reality.\"\n\nCurrencies\n\nSterling gave up some of last week's strong gains. The pound briefly fell more than 1 per cent to a session low of $1.2517 in a choppy London session. Against the euro, the British currency weakened by a similar margin to 88.11 pence. The rise in expected volatility has inverted the term structure for expected price swings in the pound to its most extreme levels this year, with shorter-dated volatility rising more than volatility gauges in longer-maturities as traders brace for more short-term Brexit news.\n\nThe Russian central bank sent a clear signal that it would cut interest rates soon, saying that expected monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve should justify rate cuts in Russia.\n\nThe Turkish lira slid 0.8 per cent in the face of US and European threats of sanctions and embargoes, though sceptical traders said it would weaken much further if Western allies turned words into action over Turkey's incursion in Syria.\n\nFar right Italian political leader Matteo Salvini tamped down doubts from his Eurosceptic League party over the single european currency, saying the euro was \"irreversible\".\n\nEuro zone bond yields fell as caution encouraged investors back into fixed income after a hefty selloff on Friday that sent borrowing costs to 2-1/2 month highs. Sterling was 0.8 per cent lower against the dollar and euro.\n\nTen-year gilt yields in Britain slid 9 basis points , dragging euro zone peers lower. In Germany, the euro zone's benchmark bond issuer, 10-year yields fell 3.5 basis points to -0.47 per cent after touching their highest since the start of August on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommodities\n\nOil prices fell more than 2 per cent as scant details about the US-China deal undercut optimism that had helped lift crude markets.\n\n\"The oil market is taking a cautious stance as to what comes next given that the thorny issues of industrial policy, intellectual property rights, technology transfer among others were not addressed,\" BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian said.\n\nGold gained. \"Reassessment - which is why gold is seeing a little fluctuation below 1500, it's a reassessment of the Chinese trade deal, the Brexit and of what the US Federal Reserve may or may not do going forward,\" said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management.\n\n\"The dollar index is up and keeps gold from a major rally, because international investors are buying US securities using dollars.\"\n\nCopper prices fell - benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was untraded in official rings but bid down 0.8 per cent. Aluminium was down 0.4 per cent, zinc fell 0.4 per cent, lead slid 2.3 per cent and tin gained 0.2 per cent.\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nMarkets climbed with investors heartened by signs of trade progress and a bout of dealmaking in the energy sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think that we will push to a new high,\" said Romano Sala Tenna, fund manager at Katana Asset Management. \"It's definitely risk on.\"\n\n\"People have to put money into equities, they can't fund their retirements otherwise. That's forcing money into riskier assets,\" Mr Sala Tenna said.\n\nThe S &P/ASX 200 index gained 0.5 per cent, or 35 points, to 6642.60, getting the new week off to a positive start. The gains in the Australian market followed strong performances in Europe and the US on Friday.\n\nStreet Talk\n\nIPO market on edge as books open for $1.04b Latitude raising\n\nOnsite launches IPO with price, terms pending\n\nJefferies mandated to review container provider SCF", "description": "Australian shares are set to drop as the initial optimism surrounding Brexit and a US-China trade deal gives way to a reality check.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3092%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_327%2C$y_295/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/edebb2750ffb4f9407535bb7c7f5896c8bc05d85", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
