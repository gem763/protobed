Reports of Jimmy flying to the UK after the split to meet with Lauren Mand, a Melbourne socialite who\u2019s been based there, dominated the news cycle.\n\nWhile neither couple confirmed the news, Nadia alluded to it in an interview with the Herald Sun, saying that it had been a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for her and her sons Aston, three, and Henley, 11 months.\n\nBrownlow 2019 red carpet highlights The best dressed of the 2019 Brownlow red carpet\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m heartbroken, I don\u2019t want to comment specifically on what\u2019s been reported about Jim\u2019s trip to the UK as I don\u2019t think that is in anyone\u2019s interests,\u201d she told the publication.\n\n\u201cMy single focus now is to continue to protect, care and provide for my two beautiful boys as this is a personal matter. I am so thankful for my very supportive family and friends.\u201d\n\nNow, an Instagram move by Jimmy has all but confirmed - or at the very least, is doing nothing to quell the rumours - he\u2019s moved on. The 35-year-old ex-AFL player has followed Lauren Mand on Instagram.\n\nWhy Nadia Bartel\u2019s Brownlow appearance was a lesson in reclaiming power post-breakup. Plus, a WAG shares what really happens at the Brownlow .\n\nThe Herald Sun also reports that Jimmy and Lauren were seen together at a Sydney restaurant on August 28.\n\nSpeaking with Channel 7 recently about her new show, The All New Monty: Ladies' Night, 34-year-old Nadia spoke of how painful the break up has been.\n\n\u201cIt's been a tough time personally for me recently. It's just so painful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI'm hoping with Ladies' Night it will give me more confidence. Obviously we're there for the cause [raising awareness for breast cancer], but I think it will be great for me to put myself out there.\u201d\n\nWant to go steady?
