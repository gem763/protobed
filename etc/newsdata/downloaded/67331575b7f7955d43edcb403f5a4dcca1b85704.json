In the new Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice, they continue that special brand of cultural engineering through a seemingly innocuous subject.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how Epstein and Friedman\u2019s cultural rhetoric works: They offer a view of the past (of Ronstadt\u2019s career, in this case) that reconstructs it along political lines. Ronstadt\u2019s reputation as a successful, award-winning pop singer backs up ideas about sexual equality and unseen racial identity, tendered as more important than the songs and music that made her famous.\n\nThis biased approach to biographical documentary keeps na\u00efve viewers in thrall to liberal ideology. It neglects the performer\u2019s artistic endeavor, which is especially problematic in Ronstadt\u2019s case since her career, as it developed through the social upheaval of the Sixties and Seventies, set off contradictions of gender and status even as she defined them for herself and her listeners. The 1967 recording of \u201cDifferent Drum,\u201d credited to \u201cThe Stone Poneys (with Linda Ronstadt),\u201d asserted female sexual independence within the cocoon of a seemingly protective rock band.\n\nFollowing that success, as Ronstadt\u2019s solo career rose, she established the idea of a freewheeling white woman enjoying the privilege of autonomy \u2014 of self-choice and self-reliance. She enacted the sovereignty of making her own music choices (an irritating preference to redo other artist\u2019s signature songs) and sustaining a career of creative expression in the wild-west competition of libidinous California soft rock. She enjoyed Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s peak years as a cover girl who simultaneously fronted mainstream media\u2019s celebration of itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt helped that Ronstadt was physically attractive: wide-eyed, toothsome, and short-skirted. Her cuteness acted as a seductive lever against the male insecurities of both the music industry and journalism. Ironically, Ronstadt became a symbol of what were essentially patriarchal institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut E&F ignore that complexity in order to commemorate Ronstadt as a fearless, uncompromising standard-bearer \u2014 a banality. Ronstadt speaks of herself honestly and modestly (respecting her recent illness), but the talking-heads tributes in this doc are trite. Her colleague Bonnie Raitt extols: \u201cLinda was the queen. She was like what Beyonc\u00e9 is right now!\u201d Eternal Rolling Stone sycophant Cameron Crowe crows: \u201cBut people didn\u2019t notice the difficulty of being a woman, trailblazing and having the success of a Mick Jagger!\u201d\n\nThis sets up E&F\u2019s patronizing, politically correct identity politics. A vintage Seventies TV interview features Ronstadt testifying, \u201cRock-and-roll culture seems to be dominated by hostility against women. What happens is they lose the ability to focus on themselves as a person rather than an image, you know?\u201d Even more timely, E&F reduce Canciones de Mi Padre, Ronstadt\u2019s 1987 foray into ethnic music, with their eyes on immigration platitudes: \u201cMy family are Mexicans, and that is my roots\u201d is her late-career declaration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast to the TV series Unsung, which discovers the little-known backstories of black pop musicians, E&F take an obsequious approach to established fame; their doc is Oversung. Allowing politics to overinflate their star celebration, E&F seem strident yet feeble after this year\u2019s previous pop-music bio-docs. The Sound of My Voice isn\u2019t as passionate or innovative as Jakob Dylan\u2019s Echo in the Canyon, and E&F\u2019s specious contrast of Ronstadt\u2019s recordings and ladylike personal discretion is less revelatory than David Crosby\u2019s reckless confessions in Remember My Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein and Friedman seem unable to handle the irony that Ronstadt\u2019s popular Everly Brothers cover \u201cWhen Will I Be Loved\u201d (No. 2 on the charts in 1975) would later influence one of James Toback\u2019s best films, the 2004 When Will I Be Loved starring Neve Campbell as an uncompromising female sexual explorer, using Ronstadt\u2019s cry to test the limits of libertinism, social progress, and personal fulfillment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nE&F leave us less able to think clearly about how these issues \u2014 and the cultural past \u2014 affect the political present. Instead, they merely use Ronstadt for a #MeToo icon as if the sound of her voice spoke for everyone.", "description": "\"Sound of My Voice\" eschew complexity in order to commemorate Linda Ronstadt as a fearless, uncompromising standard-bearer \u2014 a banality.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "Kevin D.
