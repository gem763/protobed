Sadly, too many religious people have expressed hatred toward LGBT people, giving credence to this assumption. We Christians must oppose this bigotry wherever we find it.\n\nThe result of a genuinely Christian view of marriage and sexuality, however, is not bigotry, but wholeness. And Christianity disallows any type of hatred or disrespect.\n\nO\u2019Rourke and Castro seem uninterested in this distinction. And if their ilk win the day, Christians will be punished for their beliefs.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Samuel Alito saw this coming. In his dissenting opinion to Obergefell v. Hodges, he wrote, \u201cI assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.\u201d\n\nWhat is wrong with progressive proposals such as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s? At least four things.\n\nFirst, they violate the First Amendment and the many court opinions which make clear that groups cannot be denied tax-exemption based upon their viewpoints.\n\nThe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution declares, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Significantly, the First Amendment does not confine religious liberty to privately held beliefs or semi-public worship services. The Constitution is clear: Religious freedom extends to public actions.\n\nSecond, proposals such as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s threaten not only religious freedom but other freedoms as well.\n\nWhen religious freedom is threatened, every other freedom is threatened as well. If religious liberty falls, so will freedom of speech, press and associations.\n\nReligious liberty is called the \u201cfirst freedom\u201d because it gets to the heart of what it means to be human. It declares each person is free to hold his or her own convictions about ultimate reality, to align his or her life with those convictions, and to do so openly and without fear.\n\nThose who are not religious may not care about religious freedom. But they should. When religious freedom is threatened, every other freedom is threatened as well. If religious liberty falls, so will freedom of speech, press and associations.\n\nThird, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s view would create negative repercussions not only for churches, but also for other institutions.\n\nFor example, consider the implications for religiously conservative institutions of higher education. Many of these colleges and seminaries have confessional statements that conflict with the reigning progressive prejudices concerning, for example, sexual behavior or abortifacient contraceptives.\n\nWere progressive restrictions on religious liberty take hold, the stripping of tax-exempt status would only be the start. Eventually, these institutions would be forced to forfeit their regional accreditation and will lose enormous amounts of additional revenue because of the \u201cdonor stigma\u201d associated with giving to conservative causes.\n\nFourth, and most importantly, when religious liberty is restricted, the entire nation suffers.\n\nO\u2019Rourke thinks he is promoting a world in which he would like to live. He is not. He is, in fact, promoting one version of one religious worldview \u2014 the unique secular progressivism of 2019. He would like this worldview to have a hearing in the public square, while other competing worldviews are censured or silenced.\n\nIronically for O\u2019Rourke and other secular progressives, the day will come when the concerns of today\u2019s secular progressives will not reflect the concerns of tomorrow\u2019s progressives. Then it will be they \u2014 today\u2019s secular progressives \u2014 whose liberties will be curtailed. It will be their fault; they struck the blow to liberty.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAn attack on liberty always harms more than those who are immediately involved. For that reason, Americans on the Left and Right should reject any and every threat to religious liberty.\n\nAnd we must support every American\u2019s right to hold his or her own convictions about ultimate reality, to align his or her life with those convictions, and to do so openly and without fear.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BRUCE ASHFORD", "description": "The message from O\u2019Rourke is clear, and it is shared by many Democratic progressives: Religious liberty has got to go.", "authors": ["Bruce Ashford", "Bruce Ashford Is The Provost", "Professor Of Theology", "Culture At Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.
