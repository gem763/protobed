Now, the rookie-scale-extension-eligible 22-year-old shooting guard wants his payday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBobby Marks of ESPN:\n\nBefore switching to Rich Paul and Klutch Sports, Beasley turned down a three-year, $30 million extension, sources confirmed to ESPN.\n\nThat offer seems pretty fair.\n\nThe full mid-level exception projects to be worth about $31 million over three years. It\u2019s easy to see a team offering Beasley that.\n\nBut the Nuggets will still have matching rights next summer. Even if they don\u2019t extend him by the Oct. 21 deadline, they\u2019ll still control whether they keep him beyond the upcoming season.\n\nBeasley is coming off a solid season, and plenty of teams could use a shooting guard with his shooting ability. If he continues to improve, he could land a much bigger offer sheet. But with Gary Harris healthier and primed for a bounce-back year, Beasley might receive fewer opportunities next season.\n\nThis is already slightly more than I think Denver should\u2019ve offered. But it\u2019s definitely in the reasonable ballpark. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if both sides struck a deal. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Beasley bets on himself.
