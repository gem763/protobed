These included two Nepali shopkeepers selling bags with Tibetan flags or slogans. Fourteen remained in detention on Saturday.\n\nIn 1959, Beijing sent soldiers to crush a revolt in Tibet against Chinese rule, leaving the Dalai Lama, Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader, fleeing to India where he remains.\n\nNepal is home to around 20,000 exiled Tibetans, but under pressure from Beijing the communist government has taken an increasingly hardline stance on their activities.\n\n\u201cThere is heavy police presence. It is an intimidating situation. We\u2019ve been asked to stay in,\u201d one Tibetan told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nNepalese authorities declined to comment.\n\n-\u2018Focus on connectivity\u2019-\n\nIn 2017, Nepal signed up to China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, a vast global infrastructure programme, which includes the building or upgrading of highways and airports in the country.\n\n\u201cA trans-Himalayan connectivity network is thus taking shape, which will serve not just our two countries but also the region as a whole,\u201d Xi said in his article.\n\nLandlocked Nepal, sandwiched between India and China, is seeking closer ties and much-needed energy and infrastructure investment from Beijing.\n\nNepal\u2019s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said Xi\u2019s visit holds \u201chistoric significance\u201d for Nepal.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to create opportunities for Nepal, joining it to China\u2019s development. We are focusing on connectivity between the two countries,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough no official announcement has been made, it is expected that the two countries will sign agreements for Chinese investment in highways, tunnels and hydro projects.\n\nHigh on the agenda is the extension of China\u2019s Kerung railway from the border to Nepal\u2019s capital Kathmandu. There have been warnings over the financial commitments, however.\n\n\u201cNepal has to be conscious when it reaches the point of financial dealings on these projects and build capacity to negotiate and not fall into debt traps,\u201d said Sudheer Sharma, editor of the Kantipur national daily.\n\nXi will hold talks with Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and other top leaders and meet with President Bhandari.", "description": "Kathmandu (AFP) \u2013 Nepal rolled out the red carpet on Saturday for China\u2019s President Xi Jinping but rounded up Tibetans to prevent protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/2f9763_nepalese-girls-present-garlands-chinese-president-xi-jinping-as-nepal-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
