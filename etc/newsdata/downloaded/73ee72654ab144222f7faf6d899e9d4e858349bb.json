Instead of holding the ball for a kick, Tennessee punter Brett Kern took the snap and ran left in an attempt to pick up a first down.\n\nHe did not make it.\n\nOfficials blow whistle, call\n\nBucs linebacker Devin White leveled Kern, forcing a fumble that safety Andrew Adams picked up with a clear path to the end zone. As Adams ran for a would-be go-ahead score in the game\u2019s final minutes, whistles blew.\n\nOfficials very likely cost the Bucs a win on Sunday. (Getty Images)\n\nThe play was dead. Officials failed to acknowledge the fumble, instead calling Kern down short of the line of gain for a turnover on downs. The Bucs got the ball, but no score.\n\nReplay shows a clear fumble.\n\nTampa Bay drove the ball 39 yards, but came up short on a fourth-and-1 with two minutes remaining. The Bucs got one more chance when the Titans punted with 49 seconds. But the game ended when Jamies Winston threw a second-down interception with 26 seconds remaining.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nReferee\u2019s explanation\n\nNFL officials tweeted an explanation and didn\u2019t offer much other than \u201cthe runner was ruled down by contact.\u201d\n\nAn explanation of the fourth-and-two play in the 4th quarter of #TBvsTEN: pic.twitter.com/QT1yIG9MPP \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) October 27, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cCertainly after the whistle, we definitely saw the ball come out,\u201d referee Adrian Hill said in a postgame pool report. \u201cBut the ruling on the field was that the runner was down by contact before the ball came out. That\u2019s why the whistle blew. The whistle was blown because the ruling was that the runner was down by contact.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s statement didn\u2019t add much to what was obvious from watching the play.\n\nHow does this keep happening?\n\nThe play is reminiscent of a Week 2 fumble that was blown dead in the Rams-Saints game. A would-be Saints touchdown return was negated when officials blew the whistle dead on a Jared Goff fumble.\n\nIn the end, that call didn\u2019t matter much as the Rams rolled to a 27-9 victory.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s early whistle likely cost the Bucs a win. A touchdown wouldn\u2019t have sealed the game, but would have given them a clear edge with a late lead.\n\nInstead the Titans won their second straight with Ryan Tannehill at quarterback to improve to 4-4 while the Bucs dropped to 2-5.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Officials very likely cost the Bucs a win on Sunday.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KllKloSPQtbv5fQDj0Wuwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTYuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t7HdRzj5AwI3WRyMlW3tlA--~B/aD0yNDYwO3c9MzQzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/eea7ec90-f916-11e9-bfd2-6c95b5e2805d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
