Turkey considers the Kurdish forces to be terrorists.\n\nAD\n\nNavy Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, reiterated the administration\u2019s warnings Tuesday, saying Turkey could be \u201cresponsible for freeing thousands of ISIS fighters\u201d if it invaded.\n\nThe offensive has turned one of the Trump administration\u2019s biggest long-term challenges in Syria \u2014 the lack of an international consensus on what to do with the remnants of the Islamic State \u2014 into a near-term one.\n\nAD\n\nFor the past year, U.S. officials have been pushing other countries, with little success, to repatriate their citizens who were captured fighting for the Islamic State. In addition to fears about possible prison breaks, military commanders have said a new generation of extremists could emerge among the thousands of children being reared under bleak conditions at the camps.\n\nAD\n\nEven before news emerged of an imminent Turkish offensive, a senior Pentagon official acknowledged the impasse the administration had reached.\n\n\u201cThere does have to be a Plan B of what comes next,\u201d Mick Mulroy, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said last week during remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI can\u2019t declare what that is today because, quite frankly, we haven\u2019t developed it entirely.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. military would change course if the SDF\u2019s response to a large-scale operation were to result in a major prison break. Officials said at least some senior militants are now being held in Iraq, under more stable conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts have also questioned whether the SDF would follow through with its threat to withdraw guards at the prisons, if only because nearby Kurdish communities would be the first targets of any escaping militants.\n\nThe Kurds recognize that \u201cthe prisoners are their only bargaining chip for keeping the Americans there,\u201d said Amarnath Amarasingam, an assistant professor at Queen\u2019s University in Toronto, who specializes in extremism and visited a camp for the relatives of militants last week.\n\nSDF spokesman Kino Gabriel said many Kurdish fighters would feel compelled to protect their families if Turkey invaded northeast Syria, which is home to most of the Kurdish population.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven before this week\u2019s announcement, Kurdish officials said tensions in the detention facilities had increased since the release of an audio recording last month that purportedly featured Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urging fighters to carry out attacks and free detainees from prisons and camps in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cThe camps and detention facilities are a time bomb. We can guard them, but in areas where we have weak security it may become easier for Daesh to reorganize itself,\u201d Gabriel said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nThe militant detainees are being held in an assortment of overcrowded \u201cpop-up\u201d prisons, often schools or government offices without beds or mattresses.\n\nAD\n\nOf the more than 11,000 prisoners, about 2,000 are from more than 40 countries, most of which refuse to take them back. The remainder are from Syria and Iraq.\n\nAD\n\nThe majority of the prisons are outside the border area where Turkey is expected to initially move its forces during an incursion. But Turkey might later push into areas where others are located.\n\nOfficials see a particular risk in the vast al-Hol detention camp, a dismal sprawl of tents near the Iraqi border that is home to an estimated 70,000 displaced women and children. The camp is surrounded by a flimsy fence and lacks even basic security precautions such as searchlights.\n\nIn an interview last week, the SDF\u2019s top commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, said Kurdish guards don\u2019t have \u201c100 percent\u201d control of the camp.\n\nAs conditions deteriorate and winter approaches, anger across the camp is growing with the Kurdish-majority guards. According to the International Rescue Committee, 339 children have died there since the start of the year, most of them under the age of 5.\n\nLouisa Loveluck in Irbil, Iraq, and Souad Mekhennet and Ellen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The U.S. military does not have the forces or mandate to guard militant prisons in Syria if a Turkish offensive creates a security gap, they said.", "authors": ["Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "Liz Sly", "Beirut Bureau Chief", "Covering Lebanon", "Syria", "The Wider Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n0KrZ886t2AsBwUjMKeLEFY7n6I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SOZZBSGODYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
