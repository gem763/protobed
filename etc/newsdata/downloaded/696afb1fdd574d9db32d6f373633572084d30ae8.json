In the captions he talked of \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cloyalty\u201d.\n\n\u201cNever bite the hand that feeds you, but stay loyal and you\u2019ll never go hungry!\u201d he wrote alongside one of the images.\n\nHowever, just a week later the posts took a dark turn.\n\nLess than two weeks after the brand launched, King posted a rant on the account about a traumatic relationship breakdown.\n\nThe post hinted at suicide amid his struggles with a bicep reconstruction.\n\n\u201cAs they leave you smash ur head against the wall in hope the physical pain u cause will dull the pain inside,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere was one of two choices to be made. Write a little letter and feed yourself a bullet, or pull yourself together and make a promise that you\u2019ll come back bigger and better.\u201d\n\nBut King seemed optimistic in comments on the post \u2014 saying that \u201csomething good\u201d was around the corner and he could \u201cfeel it\u201d.\n\nAway from social media, King had proposed to his partner Natalie, who was also carrying his baby.\n\nHowever, he claimed Natalie broke off their engagement when she discovered King was expecting a baby with Ms Taylor.\n\nMs Taylor said she had known King since primary school and the two had gone on a couple of dates.\n\nHowever, the affair quickly turned sour after Ms Taylor told him she was pregant and King started threatening to kill himself in a bid to force her to get an abortion.\n\nShe said she called police when she was shown text messages earlier this year alleging he had hired a hitman to have both her and their unborn baby killed.\n\n\u201cThe threats were saying that he actually hired a hit person to bash me and stab me in the stomach to make me lose my baby, so I wasn\u2019t pregnant anymore,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs soon I got the message, I was like, I\u2019m not taking any of that lightly.\u201d\n\nA third woman, Claire Day of Brisbane, has revealed she was also pregnant to King earlier this year, but decided not to go ahead with the pregnancy.\n\nAfter three weeks of threats that Ms Taylor endured in April, she didn\u2019t hear a word from King in seven months.\n\nIt was during this period that posts on King\u2019s personal Instagram page became threatening.\n\nIn July he posted a picture of two handguns, with engravings that read: \u201cLord protect me from my friends. I can take care of my enemies.\u201d\n\nIn the caption below, he wrote: \u201cThe closest people around you, the ones you confided in the most are the biggest rats,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe snakes in the grass always end up getting you. They may win the battle but i WILL win the war.\u201d\n\nHe added the hashtags \u201c#seeusoon\u201d and \u201cmakingthearrangements\u201d.\n\nBy Wednesday, he was saying his final goodbyes.\n\nBefore his rampage, King posted a farewell message alongside an image of slain rapper Tupac Shakur that read: \u201cA COWARD DIES A THOUSAND DEATHS, A SOLDIER DIES BUT ONCE.\u201d\n\nLast night, the 32-year-old posted a picture of him with a woman who he said he was \u201cindebted to in more ways then u (sic) know\u201d.\n\nIn one of the posts, King wrote: \u201cIt was only a matter of time before I f**ked things up, not intentionally I promise but enough is enough.\n\n\u201cLove you to the moon and back. Good by (sic)\u201d.\n\nAt 8.45pm that night, Ms Taylor, who is seven months pregnant, was lying in bed with her children when she heard two loud bangs in quick succession.\n\nShe looked out her window and saw King at the bottom of her driveway, shooting towards the house on Quakers Rd.\n\nAfter leaving Ms Taylor\u2019s home on Wednesday, police say King fired into St Marys police station about 9.15pm before driving to the Penrith station where he shot at officers outside.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Jeff Loy said they had \u201cno choice\u201d but to return fire. King died at the scene.\n\nOfficers involved in the shootout were shaken, but had also \u201creflected on their own families and themselves and how fortunate they were not to be killed\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor police to be confronted and to stand up in a confrontation under fire, has shown extreme courage,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Loy told 2GB.\n\nA male constable suffered pellet wounds to the back of the head and was taken to Westmead Hospital with non life-threatening injuries, police said. Several other officers suffered minor injuries that were not gunshot-related.\n\nIf you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault or family violence, call 1800 RESPECT on 1800 737 732.
