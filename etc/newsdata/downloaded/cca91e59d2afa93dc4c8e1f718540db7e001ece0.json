I\u2019d tell guys when I came there that I felt like they were still living off that Super Bowl high. It\u2019s over. They\u2019re living in the past.\u201d\n\nScandrick, 32, was released by the Eagles on Monday after a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. During his appearance on the show, he said the move to cut him \u201cfelt kind of scapegoat-ish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem in Philadelphia is much, much bigger than me,\u201d Scandrick said.\n\nWhen asked about the state of the Eagles\u2019 defense, Scandrick labeled Eagles captain and safety Malcolm Jenkins as someone who is \u201cselfish,\u201d and referenced the big plays Philadelphia allowed to Minnesota Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs in a 38-20 loss on Oct. 13.\n\n\u201cI think Rasul Douglas \u2014 he\u2019s a good friend of mine \u2014 I think he took some unwanted heat for some blown coverages on some other people\u2019s selfish play,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t even have to say names. They know who they are.\n\n\u201cI think when you wear a \u2018C\u2019 on your jersey, it\u2019s your job to bring guys along. It\u2019s your job. Sometimes you need to take the hard down, you need to take the hard job and you need to bring the thing together. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\n\n\u201cYou look at everything that happened. You hold out for a contract. You come in, you\u2019re not really making any plays, like splash plays. Then you go down to Minnesota and you\u2019re supposed to be in the half of the field and you end up playing a crosser? That\u2019s not a rookie we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s a two-time Super Bowl champ.\u201d\n\nScandrick\u2019s comments didn\u2019t go over well with Jenkins, who said there was a players-only meeting held this week.\n\n\u201cI really could give two [expletive] about people who ain\u2019t here,\u201d Jenkins told reporters Friday. \u201cYou ask anybody in the locker room who I am as a player, who I am to this team. I think one of the things he said is I didn\u2019t take accountability for certain plays. Anybody that goes and looks at any of my comments, I immediately take credit for all of the mistakes I make.\n\n\u201cFor us to move on as a team, we can\u2019t have a [expletive] like that in the room.\u201d\n\nScandrick appeared in three games for the Eagles. He was released before the beginning of the season and was brought back prior to the team\u2019s Week 5 matchup against the New York Jets.\n\nWhen he was being waived, Scandrick said Eagles general manager Howie Roseman told him the franchise wanted to become younger on the defensive side of the ball.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe anything Howie says,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cHowie is one of the people that if you told me it was raining outside, I\u2019d probably get some shorts just in case. [The release was because] he wanted to play some younger players and they\u2019re a mess on defense and they needed to get some defensive linemen, so we\u2019ll see how that works out for them this weekend up in Buffalo.\u201d\n\nIn response to Scandrick\u2019s comments, the Eagles\u2019 official Twitter account posted a video Friday from their Oct. 13 game against the Vikings in which Scandrick praised Jenkins after he forced a fumble.\n\npic.twitter.com/3Z2QraQb7h\u2014 Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why you the captain of this defense, bro,\u201d Scandrick told Jenkins on the sideline. \u201cThe way that you [expletive] conduct yourself. First snap to the last.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles (3-4) are only one game behind the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East. Philadelphia will play the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.", "description": "Oct. 25 (UPI) \u2014 Recently released cornerback Orlando Scandrick ripped the Philadelphia Eagles during a television appearance Friday, sending shots", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
