It has sensors that can take measurements and collect exploration data for researchers to analyze.\n\nThe robot also comes equipped with cameras \u2014 one of which can take \"robot selfies\" \u2014 and can withstand big swings in temperature, from 130 degrees Celsius (266 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day to minus 130 degrees Celsius at night.\n\nIt will also eventually be able to navigate through so-called lunar lava tubes, which are tunnels beneath the surface of the moon thought to have once been filled with lava. Spacebit says this is something that hasn't been achieved before.\n\nThe company signed an agreement with U.S. firm Astrobotic to launch its first mission in 2021 on Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander. The American lander will be launched on a Vulcan rocket from a site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.", "description": "The U.K. is sending a space exploration rover to the moon, in what will be a first for the country.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174433-1570712008695ukmoonroverspacebit.jpg?v=1570712216", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
