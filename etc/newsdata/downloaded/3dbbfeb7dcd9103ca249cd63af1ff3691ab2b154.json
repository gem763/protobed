Give me back my vote.\n\nIn 2012, I voted for this insufferable establishment icon, this inept goof who the Democrats wish every Republican would emulate. Some nights, I wake up sweating and screaming when I relive it in my nightmares. I should have taken my ballot, lit it on fire and flushed it down the Schiffhole.\n\nBut Romney does serve a purpose, as hard as that is to see through his pathetic antics. His perpetual groveling for approval \u2013 including, hilariously, from Donald Trump himself who just broke him right in front of our eyes over the Secretary of State gig \u2013 is so shameful and cringe-iliciously embarrassing that it obscures the vital role this shiny doofus can play for conservatism.\n\nHe\u2019s a perfect conservative cautionary example.\n\nThis is Mitt.\n\nMitt\u2019s a loser.\n\nDon\u2019t be like Mitt.\n\nLet\u2019s review the storied resume of Willard \u201cMitt\u201d Romney as a way to understand exactly why he is political strychnine to the conservative movement. If a council of learned scholars sought to create the most utterly hateable, totally unrelatable caricature of what a Republican is, their final product would be this Jeb!-like golem.\n\nMitt started off the son of a rich guy, which is fine, but he did not go to Vietnam because he was in France on a mission for the Mormon church. His being a Mormon is literally the only good thing about him. His being healthy and not going to \u2018Nam, even as today he talks a big game about staying in Syria forever because\u2026well, because it would never occur to Mitt to take a position the folks at the country club don\u2019t share, is a bad look.\n\nI sort of hate the whole \u201cchickenhawk\u201d thing. Every citizen has a right to opine on the question of war and peace, DD 214 or no. There are lots of good reasons people have for not serving, and my own service was pretty much just showing up, but it\u2019s super hard to take our ruling caste \u2013 of which Mitt is a charter member \u2013 writing checks that get cashed in our kids\u2019 blood when they have no kin in the game. That\u2019s especially true when out of Mitt\u2019s 47 spawn, we will never see his sons Tagg, Tugg, Zippy, Miff, Mork, Dingus, Tugg II, or Spork rucking-up to head over to Northern Syria to fight Turkey over this esoteric border dispute.\n\nThe same day he was on the Senate floor fronting about \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d there was a civil war breaking out in Mexico, yet Mitt couldn\u2019t spare a second to fight to secure our own border. Every year, our open border literally kills thousands of Americans, via criminals and fentanyl. That\u2019s what we\u2019re interested in, not refereeing between tribes on the other side of the globe. But the folks who really matter to Mitt, his fat cat elite pals, decreed that we just have to accept the open borders butcher\u2019s bill because they need the serf labor and new voters, so Mitt\u2019s right there championing the Kurds instead of you and your family.\n\nI oppose Turkey and generally like the Kurds, but I like Americans better, and so should our Republican politicians.\n\nBeyond his class solidarity, Mitt\u2019s loyalty is to Mitt and the glory that he believes should come from his blazing Mittness. He started in Michigan, then was governor in Massachusetts, then ran for president, then thought about running for Senate from New Hampshire, then moved to rich guy central in La Jolla, then ran for Senate in Utah. He\u2019s the establishment equivalent of the cheesy strippers who you see on Southwest flights from LAX to Vegas every Friday night, with little carry-bags for their g-strings. Except they have the self-respect that comes with knowing they didn\u2019t earn their dollars shipping American jobs to Szechuan.\n\nHis political loyalty is similarly tightly focused through the lens of Mitt. This is the guy who imposed the precursor of Obamacare on Massachusetts, which, in fairness, deserved it. He pretended to be conservative when he was trying to get us to elect him president and now, when we actually have a conservative Republican president doing conservative things, he\u2019s siding with the Democrats because that Republican president is not him.\n\nOf course, Mitt will vote to convict when the impeachment idiocy heads over to the Senate. He couldn\u2019t pass up the pats on his impeccably coiffed head that would come from the very same liberal establishment that pummeled him as a cancer-causing, dog torturing bigot. Of course, this claim was unfair \u2013 he probably never caused cancer. But that whole dog on the roof thing was super weird, and I can\u2019t forget the utter lack of character he showed by firing the great (now Ambassador) Ric Grenell from his campaign when some people realized Ric was gay. Mitt tossed a friend away because he was scared that his friend would be a liability \u2013 what do you think he would do to us Normals and our interests the second the elite put pressure on him?\n\nWell, we know. He\u2019s doing it right now. He\u2019s John Kasich with a job and a dad who was most definitely not a postman.\n\nIt\u2019s his weakness that really grates, the pseudo-gentlemanly submissiveness to the abuse of the elite we saw for far too long among our alleged True Conservative\u2122 betters. We\u2019ve learned that \u201cbeing the bigger man\u201d and not fighting back were not some sort of higher principle being put into action but were, rather, the manifestation of the weakness inherent in the conservatives of the cruise ship class. Candy Crowley humiliated him in front of the entire country and he just took it. Well, we\u2019re sick of just taking it. He and his human puffball ilk are why we said \u201cAhoy\u201d to Donald Trump.\n\nThis is what makes Mitt mad \u2013 not the depredations of the left but his rejection by the people like us, who he sucked up to in 2008 and 2012, after it became obvious what a fraud he is.\n\nHey Mitt, I want my vote back.\n\nWith marshmallow geniuses like Mitt Romney in charge, it\u2019d just be a matter of time before my action-packed yet hilarious novels of America torn apart by liberal malice, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire (Number IV, Collapse, is done and drops in November) came true! The Romney cheering section at The Bulwark, whatever that is, call my books \u201cappalling,\u201d so you\u2019ll want to check them out!", "description": "I want my vote back, Mitt.
