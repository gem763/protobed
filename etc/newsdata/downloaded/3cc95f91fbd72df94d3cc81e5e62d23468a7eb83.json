Per share, earnings were 56 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected 54 cents per share.\n\nEarnings were hit by a $2.1 billion charge related to the coming dissolution of the bank's payment-processing partnership with First Data Corp.\n\nThird-quarter revenue was $22.81 billion, up from $22.72 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected $22.58 billion.\n\nProfit rose in the bank's consumer banking, wealth and commercial units, but fell in the division that houses sales and trading.\n\nBank of America benefited from the series of interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve that began in late 2015. That is because the bank was able to charge borrowers more interest without having to significantly increase payouts to depositors.\n\nBut now the Fed is moving in the other direction: It cut rates twice in the third quarter. That weighed on the bank's lending businesses. Net interest income rose 1% from a year earlier and held steady from the prior quarter.\n\nNet interest margin fell to 2.41% from 2.44% in the prior quarter.\n\nLoans were up about 5% and deposits rose about 4% from a year earlier.\n\nTrading revenue rose 4%.\n\nWrite to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 07:45 ET (11:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
