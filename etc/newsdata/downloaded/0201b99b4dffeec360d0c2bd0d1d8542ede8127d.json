Photograph: RAKIN\n\nWhen her husband was paralysed by a stroke, Shirina Begum faced a bleak future: a sick partner to care for, a family to feed, and no regular income. But once she started planting seeds for vegetables on her small plot of land, everything changed.\n\nJump forward five years, and Begum\u2019s bumper crops of aubergine, bitter gourd and more are bringing in enough money that she can even put her daughter through college \u2013 she hopes she\u2019ll be a doctor.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive turnaround, and one that reflects a seismic shift in Bangladesh\u2019s seed sector over the past two decades. For Begum, the game-changer was access to vegetable seeds produced by Lal Teer Seed, the country\u2019s largest private seed company, which was only able to enter the market after reforms in the 1990s ended the public sector stranglehold.\n\n\u201cBefore using Lal Teer\u2019s seeds, I couldn\u2019t cover our costs,\u201d says Begum. \u201cBut now I am getting more harvests, my income is increasing, and my family\u2019s lives are more comfortable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shirina Begum has increased her harvests, and is able to make use of services such as weather warnings and pest advice\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most densely populated countries, Bangladesh has long struggled to feed its people. Most Bangladeshis still lack sufficient nutrition, and one in three children under the age of five are affected by stunted growth, according to 2016 research by the World Food Programme. With a population of 165 million that\u2019s forecast to pass well over 200 million by 2050 and the impacts of the climate breakdown intensifying, this pressure is only set to grow.\n\nBy developing high-yielding seeds suited to shifting climatic conditions, and distributing these up and down Bangladesh, Lal Teer is intent on changing the narrative. \u201cWe have limited land. We have to produce more is the simple answer,\u201d says Lal Teer\u2019s managing director, Mahbub Anam.\n\nLal Teer joined Business Call to Action in 2016 with a promise to provide 30% of the quality seeds needed to secure Bangladesh\u2019s food supply by 2020. Today, it sells more than 130 varieties of 33 different vegetables to approximately 17 million customers, and releases up to seven new varieties a year. Its biotechnology lab is working to halve seed development time, and the company has even expanded into livestock breed development, charging a team of breeders, veterinary staff and nutritionists with boosting the meat and milk yields of Bangladeshi cows.\n\nThis all marks a long journey since the company was first dreamed up, over coffee in one of Dhaka\u2019s international hotels, following a chance meeting between Abdul Awal Mintoo, now Lal Teer\u2019s chair, and Dutch seed entrepreneur Simon N Groot, the latest recipient of the World Food Prize, awarded by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nDirector of operations Tajwar Awal credits the company\u2019s reach in part to early on-the-ground marketing campaigns, which saw teams sent out across the country, sometimes trekking for miles, boxes on heads, to reach remote villages. Once there, they would stay for days, ensuring everything from seed transplantation to irrigation was handled correctly. Some farmers were invited to the capital for training in agronomy and horticulture.\n\n\u201cFrom there it was a slow build that grew and grew and grew to a point where farmers were vocalising for us, also teaching other farmers,\u201d says Awal.\n\nThis grassroots approach continues today. Lal Teer is working with an international consortium to bring drought and saline-resilient crops to farmers in southern Bangladesh, for example. It also trains them in drip irrigation, raised-bed farming and other techniques designed to mitigate the effects of the region\u2019s increasingly salty soil, which has ravaged crop production and worsened malnutrition.\n\nInnovative distribution methods have meanwhile helped empower women like Begum across the country, says Awal, pointing to the company\u2019s mini packets, which provide homestead farmers with a handful of assorted vegetable seeds. This allows them to use small areas of land to boost income, without forking out for large bags that will mostly go to waste.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lal Teer\u2019s biotechnology lab develops high-yielding seeds that are drought and saline resilient\n\nWhen women start growing extra veg at home, it also improves their children\u2019s diets, adds Awal: \u201cThey can sell some to the market, barter with their neighbours, but also keep some in the home.\u201d\n\nDespite the advances, there is still huge unmet demand for high-quality seeds in Bangladesh, says Deepthi Kolady, an agricultural economist at South Dakota State University. This has consequences across society: \u201cWhen your seed quality is low and you put in all these resources, then wastage happens,\u201d she says. \u201cThat yield gap is very high, so that translates into food supply, and prices, and farmers\u2019 net income.\u201d\n\nTo maximise the benefits of private research, government must also play a role, says Kolady. Beefing up and enforcing copyright law is an obvious first step, she says, since rife intellectual property theft is likely deterring would-be investors. Lal Teer reports losing 25-30% of sales to fakes, for example.\n\n'With a better environment, we\u2019ll have a better crop': how Fargreen is closing the loop in Vietnam\u2019s rice production Read more\n\nThe advance of climate change also adds urgency \u2013 a challenge Lal Teer is well aware of. As well as breeding more resilient seeds, it has piloted a platform called Lal Teer Geobis that uses satellite data to SMS farmers with early weather and soil-related warnings, and offers advice, via an app and call centre, on problems such as how to deal with particular pests. So far it has registered approximately 900,000 farmers.\n\nAn early customer, Shahinul Islam Bokul, has already seen the benefits: when intensive Cyclone Fani hit the Bay of Bengal in April, Lal Teer\u2019s advance warning and advice allowed him to take action to save his bitter gourd crop, and help other local farmers do the same, he says. For Bokul, such progress offers hope for the future: he has set up a farmers\u2019 club in his village, which meets regularly to share the latest technology.\n\nLal Teer\u2019s Anam, too, is optimistic, in particular thanks to the enthusiasm for farming he sees among educated young Bangladeshis. \u201cToday, many of our farmers\u2019 families \u2013 sons, daughters \u2013 are taking undergraduate degrees or even a master\u2019s, and then they are going back to the fields,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very bright sign.\u201d", "description": "By developing high-yielding seeds suitable for shifting climate conditions, Lal Teer hopes to help farmers in Bangladesh feed the country\u2019s 165 million people \u2013 while also increasing their income", "authors": ["Olivia Boyd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b27821694414cea5baa081fd151f21d64d4b9c0b/0_221_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ad2aac2adfdb003fde3daf8eb19edc2"}
