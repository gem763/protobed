The view from the hob into the mesmerising blue of the Andaman Sea would make the sainted Mary Berry bin her whisk, grab a pina colada and head straight for the beach.\n\nBut not even the lure of Phuket\u2019s Layan Bay \u2014 palm trees standing sentinel over perfect sands and calm waters as warm as a bath \u2014 can put my lot off the main prize.\n\n\u2018More gummy bears!\u2019 shouts Felix, seven, fully embracing neither style nor substance.\n\nEvie, 12, wielding her rolling pin like a cheerleader\u2019s baton, is in danger of knocking herself out.\n\nRose, 13, glances up from her mixing bowl, a picture of happy perspiration. \u2018Best day ever.\u2019\n\nNo fewer than five top chefs from Dee Plee, the Anantara Layan\u2019s award-winning Thai restaurant, are at my children\u2019s beck and call in three rounds of competitive cooking.\n\nDeliriously darting between colourful balloons and enough confectionery to fill a sweet shop, they don\u2019t know whether to cook with the ingredients or just scoff them.\n\nEarlier, they had completed the first two stages of the Layan\u2019s Junior Hotelier programme, an ingenious idea whereby younger guests are given a fascinating insight into the workings of a world-class hotel \u2014 complete with their own butler uniforms, chef\u2019s whites and enamel name badges \u2014 while their parents sneak off to the spa.\n\nBy the end of the morning \u2014 and a 90-minute massage that left my head floating somewhere above my shoulders \u2014 all three were versed, to varying degrees, in threading crown flowers, jasmine and orchids into delicate welcome bracelets.\n\nAnd while neither love nor money seems to get them to pick towels up from the floor at home, they can at least now shape them into something resembling elephants and turtles.\n\nCooking up a storm: Rose, Felix and Evie in their uniforms\n\nWho knew Phuket, magnet for backpackers and honeymooners, would be such a hit with the kids?\n\nBut then the Layan, where the standard of service verges on telepathy, could satisfy even the most exacting of guests.\n\nNo sooner do I squint at the sun from my daybed by the sea than a second parasol appears. Followed by a glass of ice cold water. Followed by a neck, shoulder and hand massage. Followed by a further glass of water, a menu and gentle inquiries as to what madam would like for dinner that evening on the beach. A fluttering white canopy \u2014 the sort in wedding magazines, with bridal white chairs and a centrepiece of roses \u2014 was being prepared.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much a holiday as an out-of-body experience. One where your baffled body thinks: \u2018Me? Really?\u2019 Not that it\u2019s a place where you lapse into a blissful coma. There\u2019s too much to do for that.\n\nOne minute you\u2019re gloved up in a ring, trying to remember what used to make you angry, in a Muay Thai boxing class and trying not to be startled when your gentle giant of a husband launches into a series of convincing jabs and kicks; the next, clinging to a Seabob \u2014 an underwater jet based on Sean Connery\u2019s contraption in Thunderball \u2014 and spluttering your way to the surface.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re off to Felix island,\u2019 shout the children from a kayak, having re-named Koh Kala, the small uninhabited island that overlooks the bay, after the first person to have set foot on it. That morning.\n\nHours later and his name is still etched into the sand. They all shriek in delight.\n\nThis is what it\u2019s all about, you think, as they search for pretty shells while tiny crabs scuttle within inches of their feet. Robinson Crusoe himself couldn\u2019t have chosen a better five-star resort. And, as my daughters point out, the 5G wifi on the hotel\u2019s beach is better than that inside our home.\n\nBut then, so is everything else.\n\nHotel breakfasts are always a treat, but the range here makes our kitchen cupboards look like something from the Eastern Bloc. Ten types of bread. More fruit than I can name. Even the baked beans were infused with bay leaves.\n\nThe resort has an award-winning Thai restaurant called Dee Plee and offers cooking classes to guests\n\nHow a boiled egg and builders\u2019 tea sort (milk, two sugars) suddenly finds herself in super-food corner, sprinkling goji berries and bee pollen like some Gwynnie groupie, I cannot say. As for my midlife discovery of green gunk \u2014 spirulina shots of ginger, celery and pineapple \u2014 I hang my head.\n\nWhat next? Wellness retreats and moon dust smoothies?\n\nThe loveliest hotels always make me want to go home and redecorate, and the Layan, with its staggering family villas, is no exception. We might not get away with the poolside dragons, but I\u2019m sure I could squeeze a gong in somewhere.\n\nTime to rein in my Eastern ambitions and prepare for re-entry into reality \u2014 with a trip out of the resort. We had yet to address the elephant in the room. Namely, we\u2019d been in Thailand for almost a week and had yet to see a real one.\n\nTo Phuket Elephant Sanctuary, a retirement home for sick, injured and old elephants, where the care shown to these noble creatures long past their glory was truly humbling.\n\nWe fed them, we stroked them, we washed them. Then we did what the British do best \u2014 we went to the gift shop, and bought as many elephant-themed clothes as we could. A deafeningly loud suit caught the eye of my son. Row upon row of ceremonial elephants in a riot of red and green.\n\n\u2018Finally,\u2019 he declared, proudly wearing it with a Panama hat for our starlit dinner that night, \u2018I have a good suit.\u2019\n\nAnd a lifetime of family memories well worth flying to the other side of the world for.", "description": "The Daily Mail's Fiona Hardcastle checked into Anantara Layan Phuket resort, which has an award-winning Thai restaurant and service that 'verges on telepathy'.", "authors": ["Fiona Hardcastle For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/20212654-0-image-a-10_1572084201273.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
