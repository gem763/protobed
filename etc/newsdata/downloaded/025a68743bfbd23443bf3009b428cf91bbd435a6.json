REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nAnd yet, with unemployment at decades-long lows and consumer spending strong, Federal Reserve policymakers remain far from united behind cutting borrowing costs any further than they already have.\n\n\u201cRight now, I see the economy in a good place, and policy accommodation in a good place,\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told reporters after a speech a the Los Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall.\n\nBusinesses retain an overarching sense of uncertainty, she said, even though \u201cthe gusting (of headwinds) seems to have gone down a little bit on the news of some progress on Brexit, some progress on trade negotiations between the U.S. and China,\u201d she said.\n\nWeak inflation, including fresh data on Tuesday showing the three-year inflation outlook among U.S. consumers falling to its lowest level on record, has her attention, she said.\n\nBut Daly said she still expects inflation to rise back to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and believes the central bank\u2019s two rate cuts so far this year, in July and September, will help sustain the longest U.S. expansion in history.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what to do going forward, I would like to see additional data, because the economy is in a really good place right now,\u201d Daly said.\n\nSpeaking in London earlier in the day, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard painted a gloomier picture.\n\nLike Daly, he sees what he called continued \u201ctrade regime uncertainty\u201d as a key risk to the U.S. economy.\n\nBut other risks remain high as well, including continued weak inflation and slowing global growth.\n\nAnd unlike Daly, who said she sees policy as currently \u201cslightly accommodative\u201d, Bullard said in his view it may be \u201ctoo restrictive\u201d.\n\nAs a result, the Fed \u201cmay choose to provide additional accommodation going forward, but decisions will be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\u201d he said in remarks to a conference in London on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Daly nor Bullard speak for the Fed\u2019s policy setting panel as a whole, made up as it is of 17 different people with sometimes sharply different views.\n\nBut they do represent two broad groups within the central bank: those who like Fed Chair Jerome Powell believe the outlook is generally positive, and those who believe the U.S. economy needs even easier policy to avoid sinking into a recession.\n\nA third group believes the Fed has already gone a bit too far in lowering rates, and fears too-easy policy could lead to financial instability if investors take on too much risk and asset values get stretched.\n\nThose clashing views were on display when the Fed in September cut its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe decision, which lowered the Fed\u2019s policy target to a range of between 1.75% and 2.0%, drew three dissents out of 10 total votes. Minutes of the meeting suggested at least two of the seven non-voting Fed policymakers also disagreed with the move.\n\nInvestors by and large expect Fed policymakers to reduce rates when they next meet Oct. 29-30.", "description": "With two weeks to go until their next policy meeting, U.S. central bankers appear unconvinced a partial U.S.-China trade deal is enough to dispel the policy uncertainty that has weighed on economic growth for months.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441279687&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E22W", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
