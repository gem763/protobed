I didn't see what was looking back at me in the mirror.\n\n\"Eventually I saw a pap shot and was surprised I'd become that guy. I'm glad it happened, it was worth it to make me realise what life's made of.\"\n\nHe added: \"I used to just get wasted and say whatever I wanted.\n\n\"Our time schedule was just a mess, I used to get off stage, high off the endorphins and get horrendously drunk, get up at 5 in the afternoon and do it all over again.\n\n\"We'd write the album in two weeks, it was crazy, they used to sell the tour before we'd written the albums, they'd be like, 'We've sold the stadiums...'\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLiam, who shares two-year-old son Bear with ex Cheryl, also said there was no child protection for him and his bandmates despite their young age.\n\nLiam, who was 17 when he left X Factor and embarked on his career, said: \"They don't get it [child protection] for you as you are considered lucky to be there because it's the job you wanted to do.\n\n\"It was so boring when all you see is hotel rooms.\n\n\"I learned to become a recluse a long time, and one you get in that pattern it's dangerous 'cause you get stuck in it.\"\n\nHe added: \"I was going through this crazy circumstance. We were definitely over-worked, 100 percent in the band, we had no personal life, I learned nothing about myself.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\n\"I remember getting to therapy and the guy was like, 'What do you like to do?' and I didn't know. I just sat in the chair and was like, 'I don't know'.\n\n\"I just lived so long as their reclusive pop star who was afraid of people, who just stayed inside all the time.\"\n\nLiam was asked if he was relieved when the band came to an end.\n\nHe said: \"Not a relief, it was scary at the time but I needed to stop. It would have killed me.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
