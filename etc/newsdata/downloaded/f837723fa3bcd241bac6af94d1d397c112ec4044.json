I do understand the unfortunate impact that this has on so many others, and for that I am deeply sorry. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that I\u2019ve let my team down. I will continue to work with the NBPA to go through arbitration and am hopeful of a positive resolution.\u201d\n\nWojnarowski first reported Ayton tested positive for a diuretic, which are typically used as masking agents.\n\nAyton, 21, is in his second NBA season after being selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft. He had 18 points and 11 rebounds in the Suns' season-opening win over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nWojnarowski reported the NBPA plans to file for arbitration regarding the suspension, hoping to reduce or rescind the penalty. Ayton is filing the appeal based on \"unintentional ingestion\" and did not have any other banned substances in his system.\n\nDrug suspensions are a rarity in the NBA. Ayton is only the 11th player since 2011 to be suspended under the league's drug policy.\n\nAssuming the suspension sticks, it's a major blow for a Suns team that was expecting to be far more competitive in 2019-20. Their 124-95 blowout win over Sacramento was a promising start, with Ayton dominating in the middle as part of a stellar performance from the Suns starting lineup.\n\nAron Baynes will likely move into the starting lineup with Ayton out.", "description": "Phoenix Suns  center Deandre Ayton is facing a 25-game ban under the  NBA 's anti-drug policy, the league  announced ...", "authors": ["Tyler Conway"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/834/934/hi-res-5c03d669042552fd7a5318b2debde17a_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
