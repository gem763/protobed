They can celebrate when Mike Foltynewicz (7-5, 4.80 ERA) starts at SunTrust Park against San Francisco. A win by Atlanta or a loss by second-place Washington at Miami will seal it.\n\nAt 21, Acu\u00f1a will be able to take part in a champagne toast. The star outfielder with 40 home runs wasn\u2019t yet of legal age when the Braves won the division a year ago.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me drink because I was a minor,\u201d Acu\u00f1a recalled, breaking into a big smile. \u201cThis year, it\u2019s going to be different. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nCHICAGO BLUES\n\nThe Cubs have fallen to third place in the NL Central for the first time since April, but they can fix that as they continue a four-game set against first-place St. Louis. The Cardinals regrouped after blowing a late lead in the opener, winning on Matt Carpenter\u2019s 10th-inning homer against Craig Kimbrel in the All-Star closer\u2019s return from injury. Chicago trails St. Louis by four games in the NL Central and is a game behind Milwaukee for the second NL wild card. It\u2019s the first time since July 3 that Chicago doesn\u2019t hold at least a share of a postseason spot.\n\nSt. Louis will send out right-hander Michael Wacha (6-7, 4.76) in the series\u2019 second game. Chicago switched its plans Thursday and will now throw righty Alec Mills (1-0, 3.42). Left-hander Jose Quintana was bumped a day and will start Saturday in place of left-hander Cole Hamels, who is dealing with left shoulder fatigue. Hamels hopes to rejoin the rotation next week.\n\nGOING, GOING \u2026\n\nA year after setting a team record with 108 wins on their way to the World Series championship, Mookie Betts and the Red Sox are on the brink of being eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nBoston (80-72) will be bounced with one loss in this weekend\u2019s series against Tampa Bay. Rick Porcello starts the opener for Red Sox vs. Charlie Morton at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe Rays are in a three-team race with Oakland and Cleveland for the two AL wild-card spots.\n\nCHECK HIM\n\nThe Brewers will see how Lorenzo Cain is feeling, a day after he hit a home run and then exited with a sore left ankle. Milwaukee moved within one game of Washington for the top NL wild-card spot with a 5-1 win over San Diego.\n\nThe 33-year-old outfielder has dealt with his share of aches and pains this season. He\u2019s also had a sore thumb and has been playing despite lingering knee pain.\n\nMilwaukee opens a weekend series against Pittsburgh at Miller Park.\n\nBACK IN THE SWING\n\nJos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez is making progress in his return from a broken right hand with an eye on rejoining the Indians lineup before the end of the regular season. Ram\u00edrez took batting practice Thursday for the first time since having surgery for a broken hamate bone Aug. 26, and the switch-hitter felt good after swinging from both sides of the plate. His initial recovery window had him slated for game action in early October, but he\u2019s pushing to see if he can help Cleveland in its pursuit of a postseason spot before the regular season finale Sept. 29.\n\nRam\u00edrez is batting .254 with 20 home runs and 75 RBIs despite a sluggish start - he hit .325 with 15 homers and a 1.045 OPS in the 53 games before the surgery.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/phillies_braves_baseball_83983_c0-90-2162-1350_s1770x1032.jpg?675f9176a3f348b74012cdbcb3a321788ce59547", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
