If we cannot reach one, it would represent a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s five points include:\n\n\u2022 Respecting the Belfast/Good Friday agreement.\n\n\u2022 A commitment to longstanding areas of UK-Ireland collaboration.\n\n\u2022 Creating an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland, covering all goods including agri-food.\n\n\u2022 Giving the Northern Ireland executive and assembly the opportunity to endorse the new regulatory arrangements before they enter into force.\n\n\u2022 Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory, not\n\nthe EU customs union, after the end of the transition period.\n\nJohnson said the plan was a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d, and talked of a \u201cbroad landing zone, in which I believe a deal can begin to take shape\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is very little time \u2026 We need to get this done before the October European council.\u201d\n\nAs he suggested in his Conservative party conference speech on Wednesday, the plan involves Northern Ireland leaving the customs union at the end of transition, together with the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThat would entail customs checks on the island of Ireland, which Johnson argues can be alleviated through alternative arrangements including electronic paperwork, and a \u201cvery small number\u201d of physical checks, to take place at businesses\u2019 premises.\n\nWhile the initial response from the EU27 has been frosty, Johnson does appear to have won the support of the Democratic Unionist party, which has been closely involved in discussions about the plan in recent days.\n\nMinisters believe the DUP is the \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d, whose objections to Theresa May\u2019s deal helped to kill it with the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG).\n\nThey hope the DUP\u2019s approval will help to win over many of those Conservatives who rejected May\u2019s deal. Steve Baker, the ERG chairman, tweeted that Johnson was a \u201chero\u201d after his conference speech, apparently signalling his approval for the PM\u2019s approach.\n\nA DUP spokesman said: \u201cThe offer provides a basis for the EU to continue in a serious and sustained engagement with the UK government without risk to the internal market of the United Kingdom. It will require changes to the draft withdrawal treaty and we welcome the fact that all sides now recognise that requirement in order to secure agreement.\u201d\n\nThe DUP claimed that the proposals would ensure Northern Ireland was out of the single market and customs union, although in reality Northern Ireland would maintain some regulatory alignment with Ireland until at least 2025.\n\nIn an explanatory note published alongside Johnson\u2019s letter to Juncker, the government proposes giving the Northern Ireland assembly and executive an \u201copportunity for democratic consent\u201d, before the end of the transition period and again every four years, about whether the regulatory arrangements should continue.\n\n\u201cIf consent is withheld, will not enter into force or will lapse \u2026 after one year, and arrangements will default to existing rules,\u201d the note says.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Prime minister hails new proposals as \u2018fair and reasonable compromise\u2019", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a979d5eb14a9a9d8423d8bbc333df8bf176c83f2/0_581_6352_3811/master/6352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ef9fb9cccff061436ddfadde8a0e454a"}
