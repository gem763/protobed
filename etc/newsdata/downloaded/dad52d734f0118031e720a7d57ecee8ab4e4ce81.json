It was believed to be the first visit to the mausoleum by Xi and other officials since 2013, the 120th anniversary of Mao's birth.\n\nXi also ascended the nearby Monument to the People's Heroes to pay further tribute on what has been designated Martyr's Day, just ahead of Tuesday's National Day festivities, which will be marked by a massive military parade through the center of the city of 20 million people.\n\nAlong with other top party officials, more than 4,000 Chinese, including elderly military veterans and retired senior officials, \"relatives of martyrs, honorees of national medals and honorary titles,\" and members of the party's youth organization visited the monument to lay flowers and wreaths.\n\nSept. 30 was designated Martyr's Day by China's legislature in 2014, a year after Xi became president and began redoubling propaganda efforts to promote patriotism and glorify the party, as well as to cultivate a cult of personality surrounding himself unseen since the time of Mao.\n\nThe nationwide celebrations seek to highlight China's enormous transformation from an impoverished state ravaged by Japan's World War II invasion and a following civil war into the world's second-largest economy. China now sits on the cutting edge of breakthrough technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G communications and its growing military and diplomatic clout increasingly challenges U.S. leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday, Xi is expected to preside from atop iconic Tiananmen Gate over a parade that will display China's rapidly developing arsenal, possibly including the nuclear-capable Dongfeng 41 missile that could reach the United States in 30 minutes. Plans call for 15,000 troops, more than 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of military equipment to take part in the event.\n\nThe display of military prowess is seen as a way to underscore Beijing's ambition to enforce claims to self-governing Taiwan, virtually the entire South China Sea and territory held by Japan.\n\nThe anniversary comes as China appears more stable than ever, 30 years after the party used its military to crush a pro-democracy movement centered on Tiananmen Square. Xi has revived theatrical expressions of love of party and state that were popular under Mao and has rallied the nation to his call for the attainment of a \"Chinese Dream\" of global prominence, all while cracking down ruthlessly on any sign of political dissent.\n\nXi faces no serious political rivals and has brought the party to heel through a wide-ranging anti-corruption drive. Last year, he cemented his role as China's most powerful ruler of the modern era by amending the constitution to remove presidential term limits, sweeping away years of efforts to systematize leadership transitions and prevent the concentration of power in any one individual.\n\nAt the same time, Xi faces a slowing economy, an aging population and an ongoing dispute over trade and technology with the U.S. that has restricted China's access to American technology and hit its imports with tariffs. Beijing has responded with duties on American products, and the escalating trade war threatens the global economy.\n\nThe protracted unrest in Hong Kong, approaching four months, has meanwhile battered the city's economy, with tourism plunging.\n\nMany people view China as chipping away at the autonomy and freedoms Hong Kong was promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while Beijing has accused the U.S. and other foreign powers of fomenting the unrest in a bid to smear its reputation and weaken its control.\n\nDespite speculation that China may be running out of patience with the protests, Beijing has yet to take radical steps such as sending in military forces to quell unrest.\n\nElsewhere in his remarks, Xi hailed China's development achievements over the last seven decades, especially its success in largely wiping out absolute poverty. He attributed those successes to the party's leadership and called for absolute unity around the 90 million-member body to write a \"more brilliant chapter\" toward realizing the \"Chinese Dream.\"\n\nXi also touched on the issue of Taiwan, which China has vowed to annex by force if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's incorporation into China is \"an inevitable trend\" and \"no one and no force can ever stop it,\" Xi said.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
