We tested it out and it worked for us. Mmm, we're loving it and here's how you can too.\n\nOzBargain member Synerg1e first brought the deal to our attention.

After waiting around five minutes, they'd received a 25 per cent off deal every time.\n\nI've tested it by downloading the app and signing up, as I'd never had an account before, and the offer appeared for me under the My Rewards tab within the McMacca's app. It took a few minutes to show up.\n\nLifehacker Australia understands the offer is allegedly randomised and not based on ordering habits or location.\n\nIf you're buying for the whole family (or are partial to McDonald's pricier burgers), this is a pretty great hack to have.
