Add Interest\n\n\"To be honest with you, I'm feeling numb,\" said Jimmy Drake, who lost his 32-year-old son Darren in the 2017 Baghdadi-inspired truck attack in New York City that left 8 dead. \"I don\u2019t take any enjoyment out of this person dying because he took three children with him. Had he died alone by himself, I\u2019d probably be happy \u2013 but not when he kills three children along with him.\"\n\nAs U.S. forces closed in, al-Baghdadi grabbed three of his children and ran into a tunnel inside his compound, where he was eventually cornered by a U.S. military dog, President Trump said Sunday. The president described al-Baghdadi as, \"whimpering, crying and screaming the whole time.\" He then detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and the children around him.\n\n\"It\u2019s just a terrible scenario,\" Drake said in an interview with ABC News Live \"The Briefing Room.\" \"I take no pleasure knowing he\u2019s dead.\"\n\nDarren Drake was riding a bike along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan when 29-year-old Uzbek national Sayfullo Saipov plowed him down on a rampage perpetrated with a pickup truck rented from Home Depot.\n\nSaipov was later captured and indicted by a federal grand jury. In the complaint, prosecutors say: \"Saipov was motivated to commit the attack after viewing a video in which [ISIL leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... questioned what Muslims in the United States and elsewhere were doing to respond to the killing of Muslims in Iraq.\"\n\nABC News\n\nCarl Mueller, whose daughter Kayla -- a humanitarian aid worker in Syria -- was taken hostage by Baghdadi himself and later presumed killed, says he had hoped the terror leader would have been taken alive.\n\n'We were actually hoping that he would be captured so we could possibly get some intel from him,\" Mueller told ABC News, \"but if a person is willing to kill themselves rather than be captured, I don\u2019t think you would get a lot of information from that person.\" Kayla Mueller's remains have never been recovered, and her father is on a mission for closure.\n\n\"Someone that they've captured in that group that was close to al-Baghdadi knows what happened to her,\" Mueller said of two adult men detained during the U.S. military raid. \"They know how she died, they probably know where she is buried or -- see, we\u2019re not 100% sure Kayla\u2019s even dead. That\u2019s the struggle that we\u2019ve been facing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to start speaking out about.\"\n\nAndrew Bosch/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images, FILE\n\nArt and Shirley Sotloff, parents of Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in 2014 and beheaded by his captors, said they want the focus to be on freeing remaining hostages in the region.\n\n\"While this victory will not bring our beloved Steven back to us, it is a significant step in the campaign against ISIS,\" they said. \"It is our hope that our son's surviving captors, nicknamed \"the Beatles\", will be brought to justice, that all remaining hostages are returned to safety.\"\n\nDiane Foley, whose son and journalist James Foley was killed by ISIS in 2014, echoed those sentiments. \"I am grateful to our President and brave troops for finding ISIS leader al-Bagdadi,\" she said Sunday. \"I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured ISIS fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable.\"\n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP, FILE\n\nWith the help of his local congressman, Drake is advocating for legislation to help prevent would-be terrorists from renting cars to stage an attack like the one that killed his son.\n\nToday Drake's congressman, Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, introduced the Darren Drake Act, a bill which would require DHS and TSA to require rental car companies and car dealers to alert authorities of suspicious behavior.\n\n\"Even Darren would say, 'Dad, if I had to go knowing that corrective action was taken and other people were saved maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad,'\" Drake said. Still, he added of his loss: \"It\u2019s an open wound; I don\u2019t think you ever really move on. It\u2019s just something you learn to endure every day.\"", "description": "While many celebrate the successful U.S. military raid targeting ISIS founder Abu Baker al-Baghdadi, the families of ISIS' American victims are sharing mixed emotions.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/jimmy-drake-ap-jt-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
