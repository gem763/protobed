Jim Jordan (D-OH) suggested getting more information on the whistleblower who filed a complaint about President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine regarding former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nJordan said there is something \u201csuspect\u201d about the anonymous whistleblower who had no first-hand knowledge of the call, adding we need to know more about the whistleblower \u201cif we\u2019re ever going to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of things that have come out in the last day that make this thing even more suspect because the complaint was \u2014 there\u2019s been reporting that says the complaint\u2019s on July 25. \u2026 Then there\u2019s an 18-day time period before that the complaint actually gets filed. So, he does a memo where he talks about the frightening and crazy call that took place between President Trump and President Zelensky,\u201d Jordan outlined.\n\n\u201cSo, if it was so frightening and so crazy, why did this whistleblower wait 18 days to file the complaint?\u201d he continued. \u201cThat makes someone wonder. So, I think there\u2019s lots of questions we have to have and, frankly, we do need to hear about and know more about this whistleblower if we\u2019re ever going to get to the bottom of this. And I think \u2026 the American people deserve that when you think about the impeachment of the guy we elected president.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During Wednesday's \"America's Newsroom\" on Fox News Channel, Rep.
