John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, told \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" that Democrats' allegation that President Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate both election interference and a company linked to Joe Biden's son is a \u201cframe job.\"\n\nActing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified on Tuesday -- and in his opening remarks to House lawmakers, obtained by Fox News -- voiced his apparent frustration that his personal policy preference for providing strong military support to Ukraine was being undercut at points by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI read that testimony\u2026 and there were things that provided greater detail,\u201d Ratcliffe noted, but nothing worthy of impeachment.\n\nREAD TAYLOR'S FULL OPENING STATEMENT\n\nNo impeachment witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that U.S. aid was being withheld, he said.\n\n\u201cNeither this witness or any other witness has provided any evidence\u201d of Trump's alleged attempt to hold back military aid to Ukraine, he continued.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, fired back Tuesday over Taylor's testimony: \"President Trump has done nothing wrong -- this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nRatcliffe noted that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., refuses to bring direct testimony over the revelation that his office had contact with the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower.\n\nRatcliffe noted: \u201cHe won\u2019t bring those witnesses forward.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe said House Democrats change the rules every day. \u201cIt changes every day because they haven\u2019t made up their minds,\u201d he said about House Democrats. \u201cThis is an abuse of power\u2026 It should be conducted in the open.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
