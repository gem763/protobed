They said they would rather like to get someone in to help us analyse the opposition\u2019s defensive structures,\u201d Erasmus told reporters in Nagoya on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we don\u2019t really need for the Southern Hemisphere teams that we play on a regular basis, but knowing we will probably play Scotland or Ireland, and maybe England and so on, I know how good Felix is at that.\n\n\u201cThe analysis he does on individual players and team defensive structures is phenomenal and his work ethic ... it wasn\u2019t somebody that I had to convince to think the way we think.\u201d\n\nJones, 32, played 13 times for Ireland, including a 29-15 victory in Dublin in 2014 in which six of the current Springbok squad played.\n\n\u201cHe has slotted in really well with the boys, he is a young guy and so associates with them really well.\n\n\u201cWe will tap into his brain. He does a lot of work individually with the players to help them get better.\n\n\u201cIn the Northern Hemisphere there is a lot more focus on small details that we in South Africa take as brute talent and don\u2019t try to refine. That is something I want to change in our rugby.\u201d\n\nThe Springboks and Ireland are on course for a potential quarter-final meeting in Tokyo on Oct. 20 and Erasmus says he was impressed with the Irish performance in the resounding 27-3 Pool A victory over Scotland on Sunday.\n\n\u201cApart from New Zealand they were the only other team that put in a full 80 minutes of constructive, well-planned, decisive and clinical rugby (in the opening matches),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPhysically and tactically they were really good, the same as New Zealand. Those are the two teams that I think have been really consistent in the last two years and they will both be a really tough opponents.\u201d\n\nThe Boks are next in action on Saturday against minnow neighbours Namibia at the City of Toyota Stadium.", "description": "South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has hailed the impact of his new defence tactician Felix Jones, and picked Ireland and New Zealand as the most impressive of the teams in the early stages of the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433669682&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0GO-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
