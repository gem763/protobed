So, you\u2019re giving the gift of junk, and helping save someone\u2019s IRL junk. Double win.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t like getting a little handcrafted gift? And it\u2019s nice to get mail these days that isn\u2019t a bill,\u201d Brendan told news.com.au.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just any penis drawings, no. You can request a specific theme or design, so these are real works of art, not just doodle doodles.\n\n\u201cThey can be themed in a certain way. I can make it look like the recipient, say if it\u2019s a friend with glasses and a moustache,\u201d Brendan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to do an Australian-themed one for someone who moved overseas. I\u2019ve had superhero requests and cartoon characters.\u201d\n\nOther designs include a Wrecking Ball-esque Miley Cyrus-themed peen, a superhero and even a peen with a moustache and glasses to look like one recipient.\n\nThe idea all started when Brendan was at work and tasked with creating the most value possible from a few blank pieces of paper.\n\nObviously, he drew a bunch of dicks on them and sold them online to the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cMyself and two colleagues made a quick website and shared it around and got some amused interest. We kept it going \u2014 it felt like we were onto a good thing.\u201d\n\nIf you think this is some gimicky joke, think again because Brendan has sold more than 1000 schlongs over the years, making this a pretty lucrative side-hustle.\n\nHowever, being the true-blue, penis-loving legend that he is, Brendan doesn\u2019t really see a profit from the side hustle, with a large portion of the proceeds going to charity and covering the costs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really keeping anything for ourselves. Anything left over goes to materials, website costs and stamps, or we use it for promo,\u201d Mr Pearce said. \u201cWe\u2019ve given just over $4000 to charity.\u201d\n\nThis man just really loves drawing dicks.\n\nYou can send your friend a penis drawing by visiting www.sendyourfriendapenisdrawing.com.
