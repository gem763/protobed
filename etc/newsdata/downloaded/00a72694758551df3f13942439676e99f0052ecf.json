Right now, 22 people have been hospitalized; 12 more people\u2019s cases are being reviewed.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the symptoms associated with the hospitalizations are from a single illness. In Illinois, the people who are being hospitalized are relatively young: between the ages of 17 and 38. Symptoms include being short of breath or having difficulty breathing, according to the CDC. Some patients said they had chest pain before being hospitalized. Others experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue.\n\n\u201cWe must get the word out that using e-cigarettes and vaping can be dangerous\u201d\n\nThe cause is unknown, though CDC officials say it\u2019s unlikely that a virus or bacteria is the culprit. No one has identified any particular product that might be sickening people, either. The CDC is urging doctors to report any unexplained cases of lung illnesses that might be linked to vaping, along with information about what products their patients are using. The CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and state public health officials are investigating the unexplained lung disease.\n\n\u201cThe severity of illness people are experiencing is alarming and we must get the word out that using e-cigarettes and vaping can be dangerous,\u201d said Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, in a statement.", "description": "The first person has died after being hospitalized from what appears to be an unknown lung illness linked to vaping, according to the CDC.", "authors": ["Justine Calma", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kouHZM45d8UPNTBBjmE-vFYlKTI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13432271/akrales_181108_3053_0035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
