He said the U.K. would consider taking part in a U.S.-led military effort to bolster the Gulf kingdom\u2019s defenses.\n\nBut the Conservative prime minister also said the U.K. would work with allies to \u201cde-escalate\u201d Middle East tensions that have soared since the Sept. 14 attack on the world\u2019s largest oil processor and an oil field.\n\nBritain had previously held back from attributing blame for the drone and missile attack. Saudi Arabia and the United States say Iran was responsible.\n\nJohnson told reporters flying with him late Sunday to New York for the U.N. General Assembly that now \u201cthe U.K. is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran\u201d for the attack by drones and cruise missiles.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Johnson is also due to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. He said he wanted Britain to be \u201ca bridge between our European friends and the Americans when it comes to the crisis in the Gulf.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Europe have diverged sharply on how to deal with Iran. European nations, including Britain, still adhere to an international deal designed to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, but Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the agreement.\n\nJohnson stressed the need for a diplomatic response to the Gulf tensions, but said Britain would consider any request for military help. The Trump administration announced Friday that it would send additional U.S. troops and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of a \u201cdefensive\u201d deployment. Officials said the number of troops was likely to be in the hundreds.\n\n\u201cWe will be following that very closely,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd clearly if we are asked, either by the Saudis or by the Americans, to have a role, then we will consider in what way we could be useful. We will consider in what way we could be useful, if asked, depending on what the exact plan is.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s president called on Western powers Sunday to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to regional nations led by Tehran.\n\nA U.K. official told The Associated Press that a claim of responsibility for the attacks by Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen was \u201cimplausible.\u201d He said remnants of Iran-made cruise missiles were found at the attack site, and \u201cthe sophistication points very, very firmly to Iranian involvement.\u201d He spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings.\n\nThe official did not say whether Britain believed the attack was launched from Iranian soil.\n\nIran denies responsibility and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an \u201call-out war.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Britain has concluded that Iran was responsible for attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said", "authors": ["Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/boris-johnson-iran-uk-saudi-attack.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C43px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
