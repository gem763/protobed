In it, they are reportedly pressuring the three payment giants to look closer at the regulatory implications of Libra.\n\nThe report comes a week after the rumors started to spread about the companies\u2019 cold feet over Facebook\u2019s digital currency. PayPal, formerly a member of Libra, then officially left, saying that it fears the kind of repercussions the letter appears to embody. The senators\u2019 latest message reads:\n\n\u201cFacebook is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination, and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control. [...] You should be concerned that any weaknesses in Facebook\u2019s risk management systems will become weaknesses in your systems that you may not be able to effectively mitigate.\u201d\n\nA widely-forecast backlash\n\nOne of the letter\u2019s authors, Sherrod Brown, is conspicuous for being the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. As Cointelegraph reported, the Committee has taken a highly skeptical view of Libra, conducting multiple hearings in which it grilled executives over their plans.\n\nBrown now seems to suggest that a general distrust of Facebook could translate into distrust of its financial activities. His words echo the predictions of teething problems made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse earlier.\n\n\u201cFacebook has been in the crosshairs of a bunch of governments around the world,\u201d he summarized, adding that he doubts Libra would appear before 2023.", "description": "A letter tells Visa, Mastercard and Stripe that they \u201cshould be concerned\u201d about the implications of supporting Facebook\u2019s Libra nodes", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvY2NkZTAxZGFmNDU1NjNhNjQzMDVlMjY0NWNlZmQ1NmIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
