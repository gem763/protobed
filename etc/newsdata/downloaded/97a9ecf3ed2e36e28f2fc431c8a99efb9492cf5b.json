The league made the announcement Saturday.\n\nKuznetsov will not appeal the suspension, according to the league. He will miss the Capitals\u2019 first two road games and the home opener Oct. 5 against Carolina. He is eligible to return Oct. 8 for a home game against the Dallas Stars.\n\nIn May Kuznetsov tested positive for the drug while playing for the Russian team at worlds, and the IIHF later announced a four-year ban from international competition. The NHL considers cocaine a \u201cdrug of abuse\u201d which does not often warrant league punishment.\n\nBut before this incident, Kuznetsov was on the record denying ever using illicit drugs after a video leaked showing him in a Las Vegas hotel room sitting next to a table that appeared to have lines of cocaine.\n\nThat insincerity may have factored into the NHL\u2019s decision. Kuznetsov met with commissioner Gary Bettman Monday before the league announced its punishment for \u201cinappropriate conduct.\u201d Neither cocaine nor drug abuse in general was mentioned in the NHL\u2019s press release.\n\nKuznetsov released a statement saying that he disappointed his family, teammates and the team and that he would \u201cdo everything in my power to win you back with my actions both on and off the ice.\u201d\n\nHe later met with reporters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are supporting me and I\u2019m going to appreciate it and as a hockey player, the only chance to say thanks to them is to prove on the ice,\u201d Kuznetsov told reporters.\n\nThe 27-year-old said he\u2019s learned to be a father to his two children and to stay off social media more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it just feels like I spend a lot of time over there, watching some pictures or whatever and then you get so addicted to some comments or people, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI was focusing more on spending the time with the family and the kids, just getting away from that. It\u2019s actually pretty nice to get away from that.\u201d\n\nCoach Todd Reirden said it will be \u201ca career-defining time\u201d for Kuznetsov, whose production slipped off last year when he posted just 72 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that I\u2019m there for him, but I also make sure that I understand that he\u2019s accountable for what\u2019s happened and realizing that how he reacts to this adversity is what\u2019s important to me,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re dealing with your son at home or you\u2019re dealing with young players, for me this is life-changing stuff that we have here, not just for himself but the way that he can impact younger players on our team.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
