They were originally constructed in Milan in 1952 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Leonardo\u2019s birth.\n\nMartin Kemp, Emeritus Professor of the History of Art, Oxford University, says: \u201cIt\u2019s shows an aspect of Leonardo\u2019s sheer fertility of thinking, this extraordinary inventiveness whether he\u2019s inventing disciples for a last supper or a flying machine, he\u2019s got this amazing, amazing imagination.\u201d\n\nWhile many are familiar with his artworks \u2013 including the \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 \u2013 this exhibition explores Leonardo\u2019s impressive collection of mechanical drawings.\n\nDa Vinci was employed in a workshop on the site of Florence Cathedral at the age of 20.\n\nIt was there he began crafting drawings of cranes and machinery, often trying to improve their efficiency.\n\nThe exhibition shows how Da Vinci was often inspired by nature\u2019s response to certain challenges, such as flight.\n\nKemp adds: \u201cHe said nature made the most perfect inventions, there\u2019s nothing superfluous, there\u2019s nothing lacking. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean to say if you\u2019re making a flying machine you make it with feathers and flapping, it\u2019s a different job, you have to make it for human beings.\u201d\n\nDa Vinci demonstrated a radical approach to many challenges, including that of underwater diving.\n\nHe designed a mask to make it possible to breathe underwater in order to caulk the hulls of boats without having to move them onto banks.\n\nA 15th century leather diving suit was designed for military use, including underwater attacks, sabotage of enemy ships and maintenance of port defences.\n\nDa Vinci often created designs for waging war, including a cannon mounted on a rotating platform.\n\nThe famed painter also designed this giant crossbow, designed to strike fear into the enemy eyes by blasting large stone balls.\n\n\u201cThere was a tendency in the past to say Leonardo invented everything whether it\u2019s a helicopter or refrigerator or whatever,\u201d says Kemp.\n\n\u201cWe now know he\u2019s part of the context, there are other people doing these visionary designs and in a way if we put him in context he\u2019s even more extraordinary because the legendary Leonardo is not credible.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Genius\u201d runs from 10 February to 4 September at London\u2019s Science Museum.", "description": "From winged flying machines and parachutes, to diving suits and giant crossbows, London\u2019s Science Museum is exploring the inner workings of Leonardo", "authors": ["Everton Gayle"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/323929/1000x563_323929.jpg", "published_at": "2016-02-11"}
