Meanwhile, more than half say they have already turned to a robot for advice instead of their manager.\n\nThe phenomenon is especially pronounced in Asia, where employees expressed a disproportionate distrust in their human colleagues when compared to technology. For example, 89% of workers in India and 88% of those in China admitted to trusting robots over their managers.\n\nThe two gargantuan labor forces were joined by workers in Singapore (83%), Brazil (78%), Japan (76%), Australia and New Zealand (58%), the U.S. (57%), the U.K. (54%) and France (56%) in trusting robots over their managers.", "description": "64% of people said their would trust a robot over their manager, while a further half said they had already turned to a robot for advice, according to Oracle's new Future Workplace study.", "authors": ["Karen Gilchrist"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105392725-1534150860983gettyimages-555250265.jpeg?v=1571026675", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
