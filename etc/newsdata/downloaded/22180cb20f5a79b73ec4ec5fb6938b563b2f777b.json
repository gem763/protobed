I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.\n\n\u2018Of course, public scrutiny is to be expected but lines are all too regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising.\n\n\u2018In my very first election leaflet I remember writing \u201cI will always be a person first and a politician second\u201d \u2013 I want to stay that way.\u2019\n\nHeidi Allen wrote a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire telling them why she would be standing at the forthcoming election\n\nMs Allen reiterated her stance on the need for a People\u2019s Vote \u2013 a position that caused her to split from the Tories and join the Independent Group for Change earlier this year.\n\nOn October 9th, she announced she had joined the Lib Dems.\n\nHer colleague Chuka Umunna expressed disappointment at Ms Allen not contesting her seat in December\u2019s vote, saying: \u2018Very sad about it. We need more people like Heidi in politics.\u2019\n\nHis view was echoed by former colleague Anna Soubry who tweeted: \u2018This is hugely sad.\n\n\u2018We need people like Heidi in Parliament \u2013 keeping us all on our toes and championing causes they passionately believe in. Too many good people are set to leave this Parliament & will be replaced with non event yes men and women.\u2019", "description": "'Of course, public scrutiny is to be expected but lines are all too regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising.'", "authors": ["Jane Wharton"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93609178_1572354897.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
