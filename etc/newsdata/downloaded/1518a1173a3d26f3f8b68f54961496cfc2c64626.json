In other words, if the whistleblower wants to keep their job, they can\u2019t necessarily go straight to Congress, but must instead navigate a complex system of rules and regulations that determine how, and to whom, they can disclose information.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Office of the Director of National Intelligence or the whistleblower\u2019s agency provided specific guidance on how he or she could communicate with the congressional committees. The office referred questions about these policies to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, whose spokesperson provided a link explaining training on protecting whistleblowers with access to classified information and the whistleblower hotline without elaborating further.\n\nHowever, at most of the intelligence agencies, employees who want to talk to Congress about a problem without going to the inspector general may need to jump through certain hoops first.\n\nThose procedures might require speaking to a range of people internally, notifying the inspector general, and following other security practices, before going to Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some commentators suggest that the whistleblower should go straight to the congressional intelligence committees or the Hill,\u201d explained Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst at the transparency organization Government Accountability Project.\n\n\u201cThere is a process by which the whistleblower could go to the Hill, but in most circumstances that requires the whistleblower to give up their anonymity.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome agencies require whistleblowers to fill out forms with their name and the subject matter [before] their disclosing to Congress. This puts a target on their back.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, experts say, whistleblowers are sometimes required to meet with their supervisor, members of the agency\u2019s legislative affairs team or other officials inside the agency, and by then, the firewall between senior leadership and the whistleblower is often obliterated, most likely exposing them to possible retaliation from their superiors.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t happen every time, \u201cthe [intelligence community] frequently tells people that they would have to go through [legislative affairs],\u201d said Mandy Smithberger, the director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.
