They started as a dull ache, but became more intense as I got older.\n\n\u2018At first, I dismissed them as indigestion or general aches and pains, but when I suffered a severe attack after my second child was born when I was 36, my doctor sent me for tests.\u2019\n\nAn ECG (a test that measures electrical activity and heart rhythm), chest X-ray and blood tests revealed nothing abnormal. But the pains persisted \u2014 and painkillers did little to help. \u2018I was told I had a musculoskeletal problem,\u2019 says Sarah. \u2018As the pain was mainly between my shoulder blades and in my lower left rib, I thought they must be right.\u2019\n\nBut in May 2012, Sarah started to get central chest pain when walking upstairs. Her GP referred her for an angiogram, to check for blockages in her arteries \u2014 but again, no problem was detected.\n\nA few weeks later, Sarah suffered her worst attack to date after coming in from the garden on a cold Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u2018I felt nauseous and there was a crushing pain radiating from my chest into my arms, back, shoulders and face,\u2019 she says. \u2018My husband called 999.\u2019\n\nAn ECG (a test that measures electrical activity and heart rhythm), chest X-ray and blood tests revealed nothing abnormal. But the pains persisted\n\nIn hospital, Sarah was given a blood test to measure levels of a protein called troponin. Raised levels can indicate damage to the heart \u2014 but the results were below the threshold for a heart attack.\n\nHowever, she was admitted to a cardiac ward where a doctor, seeing how much pain she was in, put her on a drip with nitrates to widen her blood vessels, as he thought Sarah\u2019s coronary arteries might be going into spasm.\n\n\u2018His hunch proved right, and the pain disappeared almost immediately,\u2019 says Sarah. Thanks to a more sensitive test, Sarah\u2019s problem was finally diagnosed: microvascular angina.\n\nLike angina that is caused by coronary artery blockages, microvascular angina can cause a tight feeling in the chest, which can spread to the arms, neck, jaw, back or shoulders; shortness of breath; nausea; light-headedness.\n\nBoth types of angina can be triggered by cold weather, exertion, eating, stress or exercise.\n\nBut with microvascular angina there are no arterial blockages. Instead, the condition is caused by tiny blood vessels less than 1mm in diameter going into spasm or failing to dilate to supply blood to the heart muscle. It significantly raises the risk of a heart attack and symptoms may be worse than standard angina, say experts.\n\nAround 40 per cent of the two million people with coronary artery disease in the UK may actually have microvascular angina, according to Colin Berry, a professor of cardiology and imaging at the University of Glasgow and director of research at Clydebank\u2019s Golden Jubilee National Hospital.\n\nBut thousands of people \u2014 the problem is more common in women \u2014 are not diagnosed because tests to check for blocked arteries are clear. \u2018Nearly half of all the UK\u2019s 250,000 angiograms a year do not reveal blockages in the coronary arteries, yet these patients may still have angina symptoms,\u2019 says Professor Berry. \u2018So in a lot of cases \u2014 as many as four out of five \u2014 microvascular angina could be the cause. I call these patients a \u201clost tribe\u201d; it\u2019s a huge problem affecting as many as a third of people with angina pain.\u2019\n\nMicrovascular angina can cause a tight feeling in the chest, which can spread to the arms, neck, jaw, back or shoulders; shortness of breath; nausea; light-headedness (stock image)\n\nTraditionally, microvascular angina is diagnosed using a stress echocardiogram, where the heart is put under stress through exercise or medication to look at how it and other blood vessels are working under pressure; a coronary angiogram, where dye is inserted into the arteries to view them; or an MRI scan.\n\nBut in a new, more sensitive, test a thin flexible guidewire is passed into the main heart artery to measure small blood vessel function at the time of the angiogram.\n\nA chemical called acetylcholine is then infused into the artery to measure how the small blood vessels are working.\n\nSarah underwent the test in hospital and it revealed her blood vessels were going into spasm and constricting, restricting blood flow to the heart.\n\nIn a study, called CorMicA and funded by the British Heart Foundation, Professor Berry found patient care guided by the new test makes a \u2018significant difference\u2019 to outcomes.\n\nQuality of life and severity of angina symptoms were improved in the group treated with the additional test, compared to those who received standard angiogram-guided care, as their microvascular angina had been diagnosed and treated.\n\nBoth microvascular angina (that Sarah was diagnosed with) and angina that is caused by coronary artery blockages can be triggered by cold weather, exertion, eating, stress or exercise\n\nThe results were published last year in the Journal Of The American College Of Cardiology. But this test is not widely available on the NHS outside specialist centres, as doctors can only use it off-label (for a purpose for which it is not licensed) \u2014 on a pre-planned, named patient basis only.\n\nProfessor Berry says there needs to be more research in order for the licence to be changed, which could take up to five years.\n\nThough microvascular angina sounds like a less serious version of angina, the symptoms and health problems it can cause are just as severe, as the blood vessels it affects are too small to treat with stents and bypass surgery.\n\nAttacks typically last between ten and 30 minutes or longer, compared with 15 to 20 minutes with angina, and more commonly occur at random, even when at rest.\n\nSome experts say there may be a hormonal basis for women being affected more, with symptoms flaring up at certain points in the monthly cycle, and during or after the menopause.\n\nChris Gale, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Leeds University, says women with microvascular angina are falling through the net because there\u2019s still a focus on coronary artery blockages.\n\n\u2018If an angiogram or MRI scan doesn\u2019t show blockages there can be this misconception there\u2019s nothing wrong or that nothing can be done \u2014 but there are treatments that can help,\u2019 he says.\n\nThere also needs to be greater recognition of the problem, says Professor Berry. \u2018We need a national NHS strategy, more research and clinicians need to be better informed.\u2019\n\nFollowing her diagnosis, Sarah was prescribed nitrates and calcium channel blocker drugs, statins and a blood thinner.\n\n\u2018The drugs and some lifestyle changes have improved my symptoms, although I still get attacks,\u2019 she says. \u2018Being believed and having my pain acknowledged makes it easier to deal with.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m lucky I was diagnosed, but others are not so fortunate. There is a silent army of patients out there, most of them women, who are suffering and cardiologists have turned their backs on them.\u2019", "description": "Doctors initially dismissed Sarah Brown's pain in her chest, shoulders and upper back as muscular.
