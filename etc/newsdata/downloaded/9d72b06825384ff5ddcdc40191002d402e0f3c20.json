She says she mistakenly entered his apartment, thinking it was her own, and believed she was shooting an intruder. Jean was 26.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Crump listed Jean\u2019s personal accomplishments, reminding reporters that he was college-educated and worked at one of the more respected accounting firms in the country.\n\nThe case had been closely watched, especially by advocates for criminal justice reform, racial equity and police accountability. After previous cases in which white officers shot unarmed Black people without repercussion, many observers expected Guyger\u2019s trial to play out similarly. But on Tuesday, a Dallas jury returned a guilty verdict after hours of deliberation.\n\n\u201cThis is a precedent now that will go forth across America for equal justice under the law for everybody,\u201d Crump said.\n\nGuyger faces a potential life sentence for her charge.\n\nWatch Crump\u2019s full remarks, beginning at the 41:40 mark, below:\n\nHAPPENING NOW: Verdict reached in case of Dallas wrong-apartment shooting. https://t.co/BoRdjxptbj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 1, 2019", "description": "Benjamin Crump said Black victims of police violence shouldn't need to have stellar reputations in order to receive justice.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d939ba32200008c01dbf2e0.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
