The strategy has mostly been applied to stocks, not fixed income \u2013 out of a total $900 billion in factor exchange-traded funds, only $13 billion is in fixed-income, according to FactSet data \u2013 but that may be set to change. An annual factor investing survey from Invesco found 70% of institutional investor respondents said they believe factor investing \u201ccan be extended to fixed income\u201d in 2019, up from 62% last year.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because investors are realizing that whether or not their fixed income portfolios explicitly use a factor approach, their returns are \u201cimplicitly driven by exposure to factors,\u201d Invesco noted.\n\nRelated: What is factor investing?\n\nWhat\u2019s driving interest in the factor strategy? There\u2019s a growing recognition that \u201cbond market efficiencies\u201d and the many decades of declining yields make actively managing a bond portfolio a better proposition than indexing it, Invesco noted.Yield/carry, liquidity, value, and quality are the characteristics best-suited for factor approaches, respondents said.\n\nInvesco notes two scenarios for fixed-income investing that can be achieved with a factor approach:\n\nInvestors can scoop up additional yield by using factors to identify bonds that are less liquid: from smaller issuances, say, or of older vintage.\n\nAnother example is offered by \u201cfallen angel bonds,\u201d those that have been downgraded because of deteriorating credit conditions, and may be picked up for lower prices, and higher yields.\n\nDespite growing appreciation for the wisdom of fixed-income factor investing, there\u2019s still \u201ca shortage of appropriate products,\u201d Invesco noted. Nearly nine in ten survey respondents said fixed income isn\u2019t well covered by factor products. \u201cThis reflects quality as well as quantity,\u201d Invesco noted.\n\nThe three largest ETFs that take a fixed-income \u201csmart beta\u201d approach (a well-known synonym for \u201cfactor\u201d) are Invesco\u2019s Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF, PCY, +0.09% the FlexShares iBoxx 3 Year Target Duration TIPS Index Fund TDTT, +0.13% and the VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF ANGL, +0.03%.\n\nSee: What is asset allocation?", "description": "Factor investing has mostly been applied to stocks, but there are reasons to also consider employing it for fixed-income portfolios, and lots of interest...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT697_fallen_ZG_20191021101530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
