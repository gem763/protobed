Oliver North, who departed this year as the N.R.A.\u2019s president in an acrimonious leadership fight, has said that the organization\u2019s legal bills, running between $1.5 million and $2 million a month from its main law firm, have created an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201d\n\nIn the midterm elections, gun control groups outspent the N.R.A., upending the usual political dynamics. But the organization still has considerable resources and more than five million members, many of whom overlap with Mr. Trump\u2019s base. And rallying grass-roots support has traditionally been one of its strengths.\n\nAides have reassured Mr. Trump that the group is still in good enough financial shape to help him, even as his own political fortunes have shifted since the mass shootings.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump has been caught between opposing political pressures to do something on gun legislation and to maintain the status quo. He has idled in neutral while Congress has waited for a sign from the White House on what it plans to propose.\n\nThe White House has also been sending mixed messages on its intentions. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and a senior White House adviser, was still calling around to senators this week, saying her father wanted to make a move on guns even as he faced impeachment. But Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. LaPierre on Friday indicated that his priority may be his own political survival rather than making any strides on guns.\n\nIn the meantime, White House aides and Mr. Trump himself have sought to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced a formal impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump on Tuesday, for lowering the chances of working together on bipartisan measures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret the president wants meaningful solutions to protect American communities and potentially stop one of these tragedies from ever happening again,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, \u201cand he\u2019s going to continue doing his job even though Democrats refuse to do theirs.\u201d", "description": "Even before the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry, the influence of Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.\u2019s chief executive, on Mr. Trump has been clear.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/politics/27dc-guns/27dc-guns-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
