Taylor told impeachment inquiry hearings that Trump had explicitly put pressure on Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden \u2013 Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in the 2020 election \u2013 and to pursue the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US election on the side of Hillary Clinton. Taylor released his version of events in a 15-page document, in the most detailed account of the scandal so far.\n\nUS envoy says Trump used military aid to push Ukraine to investigate Biden Read more\n\nWhy did Taylor go to Ukraine?\n\nTaylor, a veteran diplomat, said that in May he was offered the job of US ambassador to Ukraine. He had served as ambassador there before, between 2006-2009. Taylor said he had reservations about taking up the role because his predecessor, Marie Yovanovitch, had been \u201cpoorly treated\u201d and caught up \u201cin a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and Washington\u201d. Taylor said he agreed on condition the US\u2019s policy of strong military and political support for Ukraine continued, at a time when it was under Russian attack. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed this. Taylor arrived in Kyiv in June. He took with him a letter from Trump inviting Ukraine\u2019s new president Zelenskiy to the White House.\n\nWhat did he find when he arrived?\n\nTwo foreign policies. In Kyiv, Taylor said he found a \u201cconfusing\u201d and \u201cultimately alarming\u201d situation. On the plus side, the new Zelenskiy government did appear to be making progress in tackling the country\u2019s corruption. But Taylor said he discovered two distinct channels of \u201cUS policymaking\u201d. One was regular. It included diplomatic support for reform. The other was \u201chighly irregular\u201d and run by some of Trump\u2019s closest aides. They included special envoy Kurt Volker; the EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland; and the energy secretary, Rick Perry. Taylor said he later learned Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was involved. In late June Taylor said he \u201csensed something odd\u201d about a planned call with Zelenskiy. Sondland told him that \u201cregular interagency participants\u201d would be excluded. And that he would pass on a demand from Trump to \u201cget to the bottom of things\u201d.\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nTaylor said in mid-July it was clear that Trump wanted Zelenskiy to \u201cinvestigate\u201d two things. One was the conspiracy theory that Ukraine colluded with Hillary Clinton in 2016 to help her win the presidential election. The other was Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden \u2013 son of Joe Biden \u2013 had served on the board. The allegation, subsequently found to be untrue, was that Joe Biden had put pressure on the previous government of Petro Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, in order to help his son. Taylor said Giuliani was behind the \u201cirregular policy channel\u201d and that Trump would only meet with Zelenskiy if the Ukrainian president carried out these investigations. There was an explicit quid pro quo, Taylor suggested.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nThe White House put on hold almost $400m of military assistance promised to Ukraine. Taylor said he was astonished to learn of this, during a July conference call. The secretaries of defense and state, the CIA director and national security adviser all tried to get this overturned \u2013 without success. Taylor told Washington that Ukrainians in the east of the country would die without the assistance. Meanwhile, senior figures were furious that Trump was insisting on \u201cinvestigations\u201d before a meeting with Zelenskiy could take place. John Bolton called this \u201ca drug deal\u201d and told Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s senior Russia expert, to \u201cbrief the lawyers\u201d. Taylor began keeping notes. Understandably, the Ukrainians were \u201cconfused\u201d about US policy, he said.\n\nWas there a phone call?\n\nThe notorious phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy took place on 25 July. Before the call, Sondland reportedly told Zelenskiy to tell Trump he would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d in investigating Biden. Taylor said he wasn\u2019t given a readout of the conversation, which was \u201cstrange\u201d. The ambassador became increasingly concerned by the lack of military aid to Ukraine. He asked Tim Morrison, Hill\u2019s replacement on the National Security Council, about this and was told bluntly: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all.\u201d Taylor said he wrote a cable to Pompeo setting out his concerns and saying it would be \u201cfolly\u201d to deny the Ukrainians help when they were under attack.\n\nWhat about CNN?\n\nAccording to Taylor, Trump insisted that Zelenskiy make a public statement before he would meet with him. The Ukrainian president should appear on CNN and announce that he was opening an investigation into Biden and Ukraine\u2019s 2016 election interference. Trump \u2013 according to Taylor \u2013 said that Zelenskiy had to \u201cclear things up\u201d and if he didn\u2019t there would be \u201cstalemate\u201d. Taylor took that to mean no American weapons would be delivered. Zelenskiy was on the brink of caving in to Trump\u2019s request but wanted the White House to announce a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting first. This sequence didn\u2019t happen and so Zelenskiy didn\u2019t appear on CNN, to Taylor\u2019s great relief. The ambassador finally learned about the contents of the Zelenskiy-Trump phone call on 25 September, when the White House declassified it. The Ukrainians were \u201clivid\u201d, he said.", "description": "The Ukraine diplomat said Trump put pressure on Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and gave the most detailed account so far", "authors": ["Luke Harding", "Julian Borger", "Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea454e4a969c160f56db243d77d2f5f5a24306a7/0_0_2640_1584/master/2640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6fd5884ce0c6bf71ffd0bf49eed6b462", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
