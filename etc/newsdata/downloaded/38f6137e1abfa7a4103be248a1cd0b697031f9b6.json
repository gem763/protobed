It harnesses a material called Ultem 9085 that is described as being stronger, denser and more flexible than traditional plastic.\n\nThe printer has been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force Advanced Technology and Training Center.\n\nMARINES 3D-PRINT CONCRETE BARRACKS IN JUST 40 HOURS\n\nIt took eight months to make the system fully operational.\n\nThe first approved project was printed on the machine on Aug. 12 \u2014 replacement latrine covers for the C-5M Galaxy aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe latrine covers we just printed usually take about a year from the time they\u2019ve been ordered to the time they\u2019ve been delivered,\u201d said Master Sgt. John Higgs, 60th MXS aircraft metals technology section chief, in the statement. \u201cWe printed two of the covers in 73 hours.\u201d\n\nMARINES 3D-PRINT CONCRETE BRIDGE IN 14 HOURS\n\nThe Air Force explained that the parts that don\u2019t keep aircraft from performing their missions don\u2019t have as high a priority for replacement.\n\nThe team can download blueprints that have been approved by the University of Dayton Research Institute from an online database that is part of the Joint Engineering Data Management Information Control System (JEDMICS).\n\n\u201cIt brings us a capability that we\u2019ve never had before,\u201d Higgs said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many possibilities available to us right now. We\u2019re just scratching the surface.\u201d\n\nAIR FORCE 'INNOVATION HUB' LOOKS TO HELP TECH STARTUPS\n\nAs the only Air Force field unit that is fully operational, the team at Travis is receiving requests from other parts of the service.\n\n\u201cWe already have a list from the Air Force level to help them print and to backfill some supplies,\u201d Higgs said, in the statement. \u201cThis will ensure other bases can replace items sooner than expected with our help.\u201d\n\nLast year Marines used a specialized 3D concrete printer to create a 500-square-foot barracks room in just 40 hours, according to the Marine Corps. Normally, it takes 10 Marines five days to construct a barracks hut out of wood.\n\nARMY ROBOT CAN GET ITSELF UP AFTER IT FALLS DOWN\n\nThe barracks room was built in August 2018 at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Champaign, Ill.\n\nArmy and Navy Seabees were also involved in the construction effort.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlso last year, Marines at Camp Pendleton, Calif. successfully 3D-printed a reinforced concrete bridge. The feat, which took place in December, is the first time in the U.S. or the Western hemisphere that a bridge has been 3D-printed on site, as opposed to in a factory, according to the Marine Corps.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "The 60th Maintenance Squadron at Travis Air Force base in California is spearheading an innovative effort to produce 3D-printed aircraft parts.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/AirForce3DPrint2.jpg"}
