Now the welfare state looks set to follow suit.\"\n\nDr Lina Dencik, of the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University, added: \"There are concerns that the government is accelerating the automation of the welfare system without a proper evidence-based consultation about its impacts.\"\n\nStatements by some of the DWP's top staff have suggested automation is set to rise further.\n\nA 2018 blog by DWP senior product owner Shaun Williamson said officials were \"exploring the potential of chatbots\" - claiming they could cut calls about sickness benefit by 200,000 per week.\n\nA DWP spokeswoman said there are not currently any claimant-facing chatbots in the system.\n\nThe DWP said it understood some people need help with technology, so there are staff in Jobcentress to help people access computers, and \u00a339m of spending through Citizens Advice to support people who are hard to reach.\n\nA DWP spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are committed to having a compassionate safety net, on which we spend \u00a395 billion, and creating a digital service that suits the way most people use technology.\n\n\u201cAutomation means we are improving accuracy, speeding up our service and freeing up colleagues\u2019 time so they can support the people who need it most.\u201d", "description": "There are 16 'bots' including to send automated messages to claimants - and 'machine learning' to sift through Universal Credit benefit claims", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5528738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Department-for-Work-and-Pensions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
