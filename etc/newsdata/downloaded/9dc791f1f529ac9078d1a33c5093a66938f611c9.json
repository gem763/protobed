Polar vortices and full-on downpours don\u2019t deter me. And I\u2019m not even especially crazy: Through trial and error and a stint working in a specialty running store, I\u2019ve simply built out a running wardrobe that\u2019s ready for any weather. And in the right outfit, bad conditions are almost irrelevant.\n\nI\u2019ve done this by organizing my arsenal of gear around temperature, moisture management, and layering. First up: In deciding what to wear, temperature is the most obvious factor to consider. Personally, I warm up very quickly on a run, so I follow a rule of dressing as if it\u2019s 20 degrees warmer than it actually is outside. This means I accept feeling cold for the first five minutes of my run as a trade-off to overheating on the first mile of a several-mile run.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll want to manage moisture. This includes both the sweat coming off your body and any external moisture like snow or rain. You want to keep your skin as dry as possible to help regulate your temperature. I sweat a lot, so moisture-wicking fabrics \u2014 such as synthetic blends of polyester, nylon, and spandex \u2014 are allies in my war against chafing. If you want to keep it all-natural, choose wool, which actually wicks moisture well, but avoid cotton, which will leave you feeling soaked.\n\nAnd finally, layering. All running outfits are built out of some combination of three types of layers: base layers, to keep sweat away from your skin; middle layers, to insulate you from the cold; and outer layers, to protect against elements like rain, snow, and wind. I might wear all three layers on an ice-cold day with biting winds but only a base layer on a mild day. But I have tried-and-true combinations for every kind of weather in between, and they are as follows.\n\nMild days (50 degrees to 65 degrees)\n\nPhoto: Lululemon Lululemon Swiftly Relaxed Short-Sleeved Top When the temperature dips below 60 degrees or the wind starts to blow, I\u2019ll reach for a short-sleeved shirt for some shoulder coverage. I\u2019ve worn Lululemon Swiftly tops (this one as well as the long-sleeved and tank-top versions) on everything from casual jogs to full marathons. They are soft to the touch, lightweight, and sweat wicking, and they come in new colors every season. This \u201crelaxed\u201d style has a loose fit, so it looks more like a casual T-shirt than a skintight running shirt. $68 at Lululemon Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the retailer Janji Runpaca Short-Sleeved Shirt These shirts are so comfy and come in such unique colors that I\u2019m tempted to wear them even when I\u2019m not running. The fabric feels like jersey and just glides over the skin. The almost drapey fit makes them incredibly comfortable. $54 at REI Buy\n\nTracksmith Harrier Tank Yes, it\u2019s a tank top, but since it\u2019s made from merino wool and is thicker than the tanks I wear during the summer (more on those below), I actually prefer to wear this top when it\u2019s chilly. It\u2019s also got a high neckline, which looks surprisingly stylish for a running shirt and gives you more coverage on windy days. $68 at Tracksmith Buy\n\nPhoto: Lululemon Lululemon Fast and Free Short 6\" This may be completely psychological, but I think when the weather\u2019s verging on too cold for shorts, fitted styles like these are warmer than loose ones since they allow for less airflow. These are thin enough, though, that you\u2019ll never overheat. I also love the generously sized pockets, which fit my phone, keys, and some energy gels. $68 at Lululemon Buy\n\nOiselle Pocket Jogger Shorts Thicker than the Lululemon shorts above, these might not be appropriate for the hottest days, but they\u2019re perfect for this in-between weather. As the name suggests, they have tons of pockets for carrying everything you need and more. These are out of stock in a few colors, but you can try the longer version as the weather cools down. $62 at Oiselle Buy\n\nBombas Performance Running Ankle Socks When I worked at the running store, most people didn\u2019t believe running socks were worth more than $10 for a single pair when you can get a six-pack of cotton socks for the same price or cheaper. And I get it \u2014 when I started running, I felt that way too. But over time, like most of my customers, I realized that specialty socks are worth every penny, for one reason: They prevent blisters. A wet, sweaty sock creates friction and rubs against your foot, leaving you with painful open blisters. Suck it up and buy socks made of moisture-wicking material, and that won\u2019t happen. When it\u2019s neither too hot nor too cold, opt for mid-weight socks, like this Bombas pair. They\u2019re soft, come in fun colorways, and offer support around the arch. They\u2019re also moisture-wicking, so you don\u2019t have to worry about blisters. $16 at Bombas Buy\n\nChilly but not cold (40 degrees to 50 degrees)\n\nTracksmith Harrier Long Sleeve Like the Harrier tank top above, this is a good choice if you prefer natural over synthetic fabrics. Made from merino wool, the shirt is so soft and cozy it makes me excited to run even on days when getting out of bed is a struggle. Tracksmith has a New England prep-school kind of aesthetic, so these shirts are stylish enough to keep on for a post-run errand or meal. $78 at Tracksmith Buy\n\nJanji Runpaca Long Sleeve Made of the same material as the short-sleeved version, this is a lightweight long-sleeved top for days when you\u2019re on the fence about going long or short. It won\u2019t be as toasty as the Harrier, but it\u2019ll cut the wind and you won\u2019t feel frigid as you warm up, as you might if you wore a T-shirt. $66 at REI Buy\n\nPhoto: Lululemon Lululemon Fast and Free Crop II 19\" Nulux Depending on how well you tolerate the cold, it may be time to retire your shorts for the season and break out the cropped tights. I started wearing these in the past year, and now I have them in three different colors. Like the Fast and Free shorts, they\u2019re so thin and stretchy they feel like a second skin. $118 at Lululemon Buy\n\nAthleta Velocity Stash Pocket Crop Here\u2019s a thicker (yet still stretchy) pair of Capris with a wide waistband to hold everything in and plenty of pockets. $89 at Athleta Buy\n\nBalega Hidden Comfort Socks When it gets colder, I like a thicker sock. Balega\u2019s feel truly luxurious since they have very plush cushioning underfoot. I also love collecting all the fun colors. From $9 at Amazon Buy From $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nLegitimately cold (30 degrees to 40 degrees)\n\nPhoto: Lululemon Lululemon Outrun the Elements 1/2 Zip Once it hits 40 degrees, it\u2019s finally cold enough for me to add a mid-layer. Lululemon does a really good job on its mid-layer tops because they have features that let you adjust for changing conditions. The built-in mittens fold back if you don\u2019t need them, and a half-zip provides adjustable airflow when you\u2019re heating up or cooling down. This helps me rationalize spending too much money at Lululemon, since I\u2019ll wear this jacket in a wider range of temperatures than one without all the bells and whistles. $98 at Lululemon Buy\n\nNew Balance Heat Loft Pullover I have to admit I bought this because I thought it looked cute, and I was ready to wear it casually as a sweatshirt if I didn\u2019t like running in it. So I was surprised when it turned out to be a very functional, and very warm, running top. You could layer it with just a T-shirt in these temps and still feel plenty warm thanks to the quilted fleece. $85 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nAthleta Stealth Tights It\u2019s time to swap out the crops for full-length tights. I\u2019m short, so I appreciate when running tights come in different lengths and then don\u2019t need to be hemmed. These tights have a snug fit that feels supportive on my running muscles and come in petite, regular, and tall lengths. $98 at Athleta Buy\n\nTracksmith Turnover Tights 7/8 Another old favorite from Tracksmith. I originally tried these as a sample from the brand and went on to buy another pair with my own money. They aren\u2019t the warmest tights I\u2019ve worn (more on that below), but they\u2019ll be totally fine when it\u2019s hovering around freezing. They feel softer and fleecier inside than the Fast and Free tights, so if you\u2019re getting chilly in those, these would be a good swap. They are also incredibly flexible and have no inner-thigh seams that could rub or chafe. $128 at Tracksmith Buy\n\nBuff Original Multifunctional Headwear It\u2019s essentially just a tube of fabric, but a Buff can be worn 12 ways, according to the packaging (I\u2019ve personally used it as a neck-warmer, face mask, and even a beanie) so it\u2019s a little miracle-worker in cold weather. Since it\u2019s so minimal, you can stash it in your pocket as you warm up on the run or if the sun comes out. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBelow freezing (20 degrees to 30 degrees)\n\nCraft Sportswear Women's Fuseknit Comfort Roundneck Long-Sleeved Base-Layer Wicking Shirt Every fall, the arrival of the first shipment of Craft base layers generated a palpable level of excitement among my running-store co-workers. This cult favorite lasts forever and will be your staple base layer all winter. The thermal material is ideal for locking in warmth. From $30 at Amazon Buy From $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nSugoi Women's MidZero Tight If I could recommend only one product for surviving winter, it would be a pair of these tights. With fleece lining on the inside and a weather-resistant exterior, the MidZero tights make winter running possible. $90 at Backcountry Buy\n\nPhoto: Sugoi Sugoi MidZero Zip Top Please be aware that this article is a bit of a Sugoi MidZero lovefest, as I adore the brand\u2019s entire range of thermal products \u2014 including this mid-layer that provides next-level warmth. $100 at Sugoi Buy\n\nSmartwool PhD Run Cold Weather Mid Crew Socks $18 (was $22, now 18% off) Although I usually wear no-show socks, I like going crew-length in colder weather to close any gap between my tights and my feet. I\u2019ve made the mistake of not wearing long-enough socks and ended up with a ring of red, wind-bitten skin on each ankle. Since these are wool, they keep my feet and ankles toasty without soaking up sweat. $18 at Backcountry Buy\n\nSmartwool Merino 250 Cuffed Beanie The oft-quoted statistic that 50 percent of your body heat escapes from your head has been debunked, but regardless, covering your head is going to keep you warmer on a run. I love how this cap has an additional layer around the brim to keep the wind from wreaking havoc on my ears. $30 at Backcountry Buy\n\nFrigid and forbidding (0 degrees to 20 degrees)\n\nAthleta Foresthill Merino-Wool Ascent Turtleneck If you want a heavier base layer, go with this merino-wool turtleneck that\u2019s thin yet toasty. You might be tempted to pile on more layers when it\u2019s this cold out, but I\u2019d advise just using warmer base layers. It\u2019s uncomfortable to run in lots of heavy jackets, and you\u2019ll probably warm up faster than you expect. $79 at Athleta Buy\n\nBrooks Fly-By Hoodie Brooks consistently churns out warm hoodies that work for both running and casual weekend wear. I have an older version of this jacket that\u2019s still in great shape, and I\u2019ll pull it out on especially cold days. $98 at REI Buy\n\nSugoi Women's SubZero Zap Tight These are even warmer than the MidZero tights! I\u2019d advise trying them on in person because the thicker material makes them more rigid (but still totally comfortable to run in), which not everyone likes. If you live in a frigid climate or feel cold in other tights, though, they\u2019re worth the price. The \u201czap\u201d in the name refers to reflective paneling that ensures you\u2019re visible to cars and others on the road \u2014 which is essential for winter days when it\u2019s dark at your normal running times. $130 at Running Warehouse Buy\n\nIcebreaker Merino Sprite Hot Pants Can we discuss butt freeze? If you\u2019ve ever run in very cold weather only to come home to a hot shower and have the water burn your ice-cold behind, you know what I\u2019m talking about. Icebreaker\u2019s wool underwear is lightweight and breathable but offers added warmth for my backside, especially when paired with my MidZero tights. If you want to think in layering terms, you\u2019re adding underwear as a base layer, and your tights are now your mid-layer. From $25 at Amazon Buy From $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nSmartwool Merino 250 Neck Gaiter You\u2019re probably sensing a pattern of piling on more and more wool layers as it gets colder. I like this gaiter for keeping my neck warm and making breathing in cold air less painful. $30 at Backcountry Buy\n\nOnly lunatics are out running now (Below 0 degrees)\n\nSugoi Women's MidZero Bun Toaster Shorts Just like the Icebreaker underwear above, these prevent cold butt while providing extra thigh coverage and are made of my favorite fabric. $50 at Sugoi Buy\n\nBrooks Threshold Pants In extreme temperatures, an outer layer over your tights may be necessary. Brooks Threshold pants are a longtime favorite among running-store staffers since they\u2019re warm and soft yet still flexible and stretchy enough for comfortable running. $90 at REI Buy\n\nIcebreaker Merino Oasis Balaclava People will call you crazy for running in this weather anyway, so you might as well embrace the bank-robber ski-mask look. With nearly full face coverage, this wool balaclava guards against cold air and warms up the air I\u2019m breathing in before it hits my lungs. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nRain\n\nNike Featherlight Cap $18 (was $24, now 25% off) If it\u2019s raining but warm out, the only adjustment I\u2019ll make to my running outfit is to add a hat to keep the rain out of my eyes. This minimal, affordable cap gets the job done. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nNike Essential Packable Hooded Running Jacket I also like to keep my rain jacket simple \u2014 it\u2019s essentially just an outer shell to keep the rain from getting through. I love this packable jacket, since it\u2019s easy to throw in my bag if I\u2019m traveling for an out-of-town race and am not sure what the weather will be. It helps me stay dry without adding bulk. $90 at Macy's Buy\n\nPatagonia Houdini Jacket Here\u2019s another lightweight, packable jacket. These tend to go on sale regularly as new colors are introduced. From $65 at Backcountry Buy\n\nSnow and ice\n\nAsics Women's Fall Metarun Winter Jacket If you live in a very cold place where it snows every day all winter long, buy this now. It\u2019s totally waterproof, so you\u2019ll stay dry while your mid-layers keep you warm. On the other hand, if there are only a few snowy days where you live (or if you\u2019re a sensible person who retreats to the treadmill in blizzard conditions), I\u2019d say wait for it to go on sale. I have an older version of this jacket, and I have to say it\u2019s probably one of my least-worn pieces of running gear, not because I don\u2019t love it but because I don\u2019t have many opportunities to wear it. When I do head outside mid-blizzard, though (because I am not a sensible person), it\u2019s completely indispensable for stopping snow from soaking through. It also has reflective details, so it\u2019ll be easier for cars to spot you on predawn runs or when a storm limits visibility. $250 at Asics Buy\n\nYaktrax Run Traction Cleats The one weather condition I used to refuse to run in was ice. I\u2019m clumsy to begin with, so slippery ground is a recipe for a twisted ankle, skinned knee, or worse. Yaktrax are the only things that give me the confidence to run on ice. Like the snow chains that attach to tires, Yaktrax cleats fit over the bottom of your running shoes for reliable traction on icy ground. From $24 at Amazon Buy From $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nBrooks Ghost 12 GTX If you regularly run on trails or in very icy, slushy, or muddy conditions, it\u2019s worth checking to see if your favorite shoe (I\u2019ve listed some of mine below) comes in Gore-Tex, the lightweight, waterproof material found in all kinds of outdoor gear. These shoes are more rugged and durable than their standard versions. $160 at Zappos Buy\n\nHot and sunny weather (65 degrees and up)\n\nPhoto: Lululemon Lululemon Swiftly Tech Racerback Just like the short-sleeved Swiftly, this top is a workhorse that gets me through most of the summer. I like to stalk Lululemon\u2019s sale section for deals on older seasons\u2019 colors, like this teal one. $58 at Lululemon Buy\n\nPhoto: Lululemon Lululemon Breeze By Muscle Tank II I picked up this tank top (in hot pink) on a whim this summer, and it has quickly become the first shirt I reach for on hot days. The little perforations allow for airflow, as does the tank top\u2019s relaxed fit. It doesn\u2019t cling to your body, which is especially nice on very hot days. Plus, the material is very soft to the touch. $58 at Lululemon Buy\n\nTracksmith Session Short I\u2019ve written about these shorts before, and they\u2019re still one of my favorites for hot days. I love the smooth material and color selection. Thanks to the short inseam and notches on the outer sides, they don\u2019t restrict your movement at all and are barely noticeable while you\u2019re running. $62 at Tracksmith Buy\n\nBrooks Chaser 3\" Short If you want something cheaper than the Tracksmith pair, I\u2019ve recently fallen for these Brooks shorts. I\u2019m slowly replacing all of my Nike Tempo Track shorts (I still highly recommend these, but my very old pairs were starting to get stretched out), and these are like an upgraded version of those. The material is lightweight and silky; the inseam is a not-too-short, not-too-long three inches; and they have a wide, supportive waistband as well as side slits for easy striding. $46 at Zappos Buy\n\nJanji Women's Middle 3\" Short Another very light pair of shorts, these feel made for going fast (or not so fast) on hot days. While all of my shorts have flat seams (for minimizing chafing), these feel basically seamless and never need adjusting during the run. $60 at Running Warehouse Buy\n\nTifosi Jet Wrap Sunglasses $32 (was $34, now 6% off) I resisted wearing running sunglasses for a long time, thinking they\u2019d bounce around and annoy me. That all changed when I tried a pair of Tifosi shades. They weigh next to nothing and fit snugly around the temples and nose bridge, so they don\u2019t move around at all. On several occasions, I\u2019ve actually forgotten I was wearing them. They\u2019re also good for winter days when the sun is bouncing off snowy streets. $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nBody Glide I always choose flat-seamed and seamless garments to avoid chafing, but if I run far enough \u2014 especially in hot weather \u2014 I\u2019ll need a little something extra to protect my skin. Swiping Body Glide on areas I normally chafe (inner thighs and underarms) works wonders. Vaseline will work in a pinch, but Body Glide is much less greasy. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nFeetures Elite Ultra-Light Athletic Running Socks If your feet tend to sweat a lot, get these exceptionally thin Feetures socks. They have an anatomical design, too, which offers gentle compression around the arch. From $13 at Amazon Buy From $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nShoes for all weather\n\nSaucony Triumph ISO 5 $120 (was $160, now 25% off) These are one of my favorite pairs of running shoes for any kind of weather, because they have lots of soft foam underfoot to absorb impact before it gets to my joints. Saucony has been making the Triumph for over a decade. It has always been a favorite among runners who want maximum cushioning, but five years ago Saucony revamped it with new technology that cut down on its weight without losing any softness. $120 at Zappos Buy\n\nSaucony Ride ISO 2 The Ride is similar in shape to the Triumph but with less squishiness, so you feel bouncier on the roads. I really enjoy wearing these on my daily runs and they\u2019d be fine for most people. I\u2019d opt for the Triumph if you\u2019re prone to injuries, just for the extra cushioning. $120 at Zappos Buy\n\nBrooks Ghost 12 I received a free pair of these at a press event, but it\u2019s really surprising that I hadn\u2019t tried the Ghosts earlier, since they\u2019re a longtime staple in Brooks\u2019s shoe lineup. Like the Ride, they have a medium level of cushioning but offer more arch support, which is nice if you have a higher arch. The foam is slightly firmer underfoot, but you\u2019re definitely still getting plenty of protection from the pavement. Since I don\u2019t overpronate (meaning my foot doesn\u2019t roll excessively inward as I run), all the shoes on this list are neutral (compared with stability shoes, which feature dense foam on the inner side of the shoe to prevent overpronation). But the arch in these offers a tiny bit of stability if this is sometimes an issue for you. I recently ran a half-marathon in them, and my feet felt fresh afterward. $130 at Zappos Buy\n\nAsics GEL-Cumulus 21 These were also a press gift, and I almost didn\u2019t even try them, because I haven\u2019t personally loved Asics shoes in the past. Each brand uses its own last (or mold) to model its shoes on, and since I have a wider foot, I\u2019ve always liked the fit of Brooks and Saucony, both of which use a wider mold. I\u2019ve always thought Asics were too narrow, but I found I actually liked the snug fit of these. Asics shoes also use gel for cushioning, which is firmer than foam. Neither is better; it\u2019s just a matter of which you prefer. $120 at Zappos Buy\n\nSaucony Kinvara 10 On the opposite end of the cushy spectrum from the Triumph (the Ride would be in the middle), the Saucony Kinvara is a very lightweight, very bouncy shoe that I like for shorter races like 5Ks and 10Ks. They\u2019re definitely still soft, but they have a springier feel that\u2019s nice for faster running. $110 at Zappos Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
