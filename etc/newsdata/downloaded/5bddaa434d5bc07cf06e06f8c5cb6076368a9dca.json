They included a pilot, airport workers and airport police.\n\nTheir statements indicate the drones were flown in 12 separate bursts across the three days. The activity ranged from seven to 45 minutes. \u201cOn six of these occasions, witnesses clearly saw two drones operating simultaneously,\u201d say Sussex Police.\n\nThe report says there was no evidence to indicate the activity was related to terrorism, nor was it state-sponsored.\n\nEarlier this month, a climate-change group called Heathrow Pause attempted to shut down Heathrow airport by flying drones, but in the Gatwick incident no campaigning group is thought to be responsible.\n\nIn April, Chris Woodroofe, chief operating officer at Gatwick, told BBC\u2019s Panorama: \u201cIt was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport.\u201d\n\nSussex Police say they have identified, researched and ruled out 96 \u201cpeople of interest\u201d.\n\nA couple from Crawley were wrongly arrested in December for the drone attack. Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk were released without charge.\n\nMr Miller said: \u201cWith support from national experts, we have carried out an exhaustive criminal investigation but, without new information coming to light, there are no further realistic lines of enquiry at this time.\n\n\u201cMeasures now available have strengthened our capability to respond to and investigate a similar incident in the future.\u201d", "description": "Whoever flew the drones that closed Gatwick during the busiest week of the winter \u201chad detailed knowledge of the airport,\u201d according to Sussex Police.
