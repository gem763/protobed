Reuters\n\nThe haze situation in Malaysia is not looking good.\n\nOn Wednesday (Sept 18) morning, a total of eight areas across the nation recorded \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d readings, while 35 places were marked \u201cunhealthy\u201d on the Department of Environment\u2019s (DOE) website\u2019s air pollution index (API).\n\nAmong the areas with the worse air quality at 10am: Selangor\u2019s Johan Setia (API 261), Shah Alam (221) and Petaling Jaya (206); Sri Aman in Sarawak (233); Minden (203) and Balik Pulau (API 225) on Pulau Pinang; Nilai in Negeri Sembilan (209); and Putrajaya (202).\n\nReadings between 101 to 200 are considered \u201cunhealthy\u201d, while those from 201 to 300 are \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d. Air quality is considered \u201chazardous\u201d when readings cross the 300 mark. DOE website\n\nThere is one bright spot though. Unlike Tuesday, when Sri Aman recorded readings of over 360, there were no areas in the \u201chazardous\u201d range on Wednesday morning.\n\nKlang overtook Sri Aman as the nation\u2019s most air-polluted.\n\nIn Selangor, 214 schools were closed and over 231,000 students were affected, Bernama reported.\n\nAccording to The Star, 51 schools on the southwest district of Penang island were also shut after the API there hit 204 at 7am.\n\nThis is a sudden change for Penangites, who were spared from the haze over the previous weekend, thanks to winds blowing from the west. KL and Kuching now most air-polluted major cities in the world\n\nWith the air in Kuala Lumpur worsening, the city overtook both Hanoi and Kuching on air pollution app AirVisual\u2019s ranking of major cities worldwide. Kuching, which was at first place previously, ranked second, while Jakarta and Singapore were at third and fourth place as of 10am. Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore were at the top of an air pollution index that ranks major cities across the world. AirVisual But when country-wide readings are considered, Indonesia was the second-most air-polluted in the world at 10am, according to the World Air Quality Index, which ranks countries for air quality in real time. Singapore\u2019s ranking on the index for bad air rose, while Malaysia\u2019s fell slightly. World Air Quality Index Malaysia, which ranked fourth a day before, was now at an improved sixth place. However, Singapore, which ranked 16th previously, was now home to the eighth-most polluted air in the world.

The Straits Times Readings on the National Environment Agency (NEA) website showed that at 10am, 24-hour PSI in Singapore was considered \u201cunhealthy\u201d after it reached a range of 107 to 122, up from 91 to 102 on Monday afternoon. The 1-hour PM2.5 readings were also categorised \u201cBand II, Elevated\u201d as they ranged between 89 and 119, up from 73 to 90 on Tuesday afternoon. PSI and PM2.5 readings in Singapore at 10am on Wednesday. NEA\n\nIn an advisory issued on Tuesday (Sept 17) evening, NEA said that the 1-hour PM2.5 readings in Singapore were expected to fluctuate between the normal and elevated bands over the next 24 hours.\n\nThe PSI was also expected to range between the high end of \u201cmoderate\u201d range and the low end of \u201cunhealthy\u201d range. Depending on wind conditions, the PSI may even enter the mid-section of the \u201cunhealthy\u201d range, it said.\n\nFor the next few days, the weather in Singapore and Sumatra will likely remain dry, and prevailing winds are expected to blow mainly from the southeast or south. Since hotspot activities in Sumatra will likely persist under the dry conditions, Singapore could continue to be shrouded in haze in the coming days.\n\nNEA advised the general public against prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, and said elderly, pregnant women and children should minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion. People with chronic lung or heart disease should also avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, while those who are ill should seek medical help.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Kuala Lumpur overtook both Hanoi and Kuching as the city with the worst air on a ranking of major cities worldwide..
