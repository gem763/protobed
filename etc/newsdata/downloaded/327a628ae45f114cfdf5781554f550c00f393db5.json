Bolton also led the Big Ten from the line at 87.6%.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Horton-Tucker, while a much better rebounder than Bolton, averaged 11.8 points on 40.6% shooting. But Talen Horton-Tucker shot just 30.8% on 3s and 62.5% from the line.\n\nIowa State isn\u2019t banking on Bolton performing like a future draft pick. But the NCAA\u2019s decision to grant Bolton immediate eligibility last month certainly raised expectations in Ames.\n\nThe Cyclones (23-12 in 2018-19), which lost nearly 70% of its scoring from a year ago, open play on Nov. 5 against Mississippi Valley State.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that, I think, can really impact our team,\u201d Iowa State coach Steve Prohm said at the team\u2019s annual media day. \u201cOffensively, he\u2019s very talented, gifted. He can score in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nBolton, 20, committed to play for the Nittany Lions after a season at Massanutten Military Academy in which he led the team to a school-record 32 wins and the No. 1 spot in the national prep school rankings.\n\nPenn State threw Bolton right into its rotation. Bolton averaged 20 points over a five-game stretch in December, and he had a nine-game stretch scoring in double figures while coming off the bench during Big Ten play.\n\nBolton struggled down the stretch, bottoming out with a zero-point effort in a loss to Minnesota in the league tournament. Bolton left after the season and, after months of waiting, was granted a waiver to play right away in Ames.\n\n\u201cJust felt like leaving was the best decision for me and my family,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cIt felt like a real family fit (at Iowa State). It just felt like a place for me \u2026 I felt like I could come in and help this team (and) contribute by watching coach Prohm\u2019s playing style and how he plays his guards. That really intrigued me.\u201d\n\nWhat Bolton should give the Cyclones is a perimeter threat who can create his own shot as the shot clock winds down.\n\nBolton\u2019s experience at the point should also allow Iowa State to move around star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, a preseason first-team All-Big 12 pick, in hopes of creating mismatches.\n\nBolton has areas he needs to improve. He had 83 turnovers against just 47 assists - ghastly numbers for a point guard - and he only shot 40.3% on 2s.\n\n\u201cDefensively, keep making strides,\u201d Bolton said when asked about his goals for 2019-20. \u201cOffensively, just being efficient. Cut down on turnovers, scoring the ball at a higher rate, (having) a higher field goal percentage. Just all the little things.\u201d\n\nOne area where Bolton might help the Cyclones is on defense. Bolton was a key contributor to a Penn State team that, while finishing just 14-18, was one of the more efficient defensive teams in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like having another dog on the defensive side. He talks really well and gives us another communicator,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the guys who wants to defend.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iowa State's hopes for competing for a Big 12 title suffered a blow when Talen Horton-Tucker decided to leave for the NBA after just one season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
