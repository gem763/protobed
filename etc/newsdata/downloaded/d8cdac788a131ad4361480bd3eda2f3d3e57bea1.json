Photo: David Wong More\n\nSpeaking outside the Court of Appeal on Friday, Au said he hoped judges would clarify when a by-election should be triggered after an election petition is upheld.\n\nHe blamed the returning officer for erroneously invalidating Chow\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cIf such error happens again in the general election, let\u2019s say in New Territories East or West constituencies, it could trigger by-elections of multiple seats, then how could Legislative Council even function?\u201d Au said.\n\nThe High Court ruled earlier this month that returning officer Anne Teng Yu-yan was wrong to disqualify Chow, of Demosisto, from the by-election \u2013 for what the official said was advocating \u201cdemocratic self-determination\u201d \u2013 without giving her the opportunity to respond.\n\nAs a result, the judge ruled Au, who ran in Chow\u2019s place, was not duly elected at the time.\n\nAu said the legal challenge was not about keeping his own seat. He said it was critical to ensure those elected were truly representative of voters.\n\n\u201cThe court should therefore exercise discretion to refuse to grant relief to [Chow], as to preserve the voters\u2019 genuine voice,\u201d Au said.\n\nAu and Fan would continue to hold all their powers as legislators before the Court of Final Appeal delivers any verdicts on the cases.\n\nThe Court of Final Appeal is being asked to review an earlier ruling overturning an elections ban for candidates.
