He was 81.\n\nThe cause was cardiac arrest, said his longtime writing partner, Alfa-Betty Olsen.\n\nA roly-poly comic force with a drooping walrus mustache, Mr. Efron dabbled in the counterculture of 1960s San Francisco before becoming a humorous mainstay of Pacifica\u2019s listener-supported radio stations in Los Angeles and New York. He went on to develop a reputation as an adroit voice artist, manic improviser and acerbic critic of corporations and conservative politicians \u2014 even as he turned toward biblical material more often associated with the political right.\n\nMr. Efron was best known for his work on \u201cThe Great American Dream Machine,\u201d a variety show that mixed animated shorts, comedy sketches, documentary segments and musical performances. Premiering in 1971 on the newly formed broadcaster PBS, it evoked series like \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d but added a left-leaning, politically charged edge.\n\nEpisodes featured Chicago author Studs Terkel moderating a conversation with ordinary people over drinks; Kurt Vonnegut reading from his novel \u201cSlaughterhouse-Five;\u201d Chevy Chase and Ken Shapiro lip-syncing orchestral music while painted in whiteface; a profile of Evel Knievel; and humorous sketches from Mr. Efron, who was sometimes described as the series\u2019 host.\n\nPerhaps his most memorable segment centered on \u201cmodern baking through modern chemistry,\u201d as a toque-wearing Mr. Efron read the ingredients of a Morton lemon cream pie and tried to replicate the dessert from scratch.\n\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

No eggs. No cream. Just pie.\u201d\n\nOne week after the skit aired, the showrunners received a cease-and-desist order from Morton\u2019s lawyers. \u201cThe producers verified the facts on the segment, and eventually ran it again,\u201d according to James Ledbetter\u2019s book \u201cMade Possible By\u2026: The Death of Public Broadcasting in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cDream Machine\u201d was produced by the New York-area station WNET and featured performers including Albert Brooks, Charles Grodin, Linda Lavin, Penny Marshall and Henry Winkler. But it proved expensive to make and, despite drawing acclaim from critics and stars such as John Lennon (\u201cas good as, if not better than, anything that\u2019s on British TV\u201d), it was canceled after two seasons.\n\nMr. Efron\u2019s next major television project was the CBS children\u2019s series \u201cIllustrated, Simplified and Painless Sunday School\u201d (1973-77), an occasionally absurdist retelling of Bible stories. Olsen, who worked as the casting director on Mel Brooks\u2019s film \u201cThe Producers\u201d before writing for Mr. Efron on \u201cDream Machine,\u201d said she created the show after CBS offered the duo a Sunday morning time slot.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s Sunday morning, let\u2019s do Bible stories,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cMarshall really admired this Japanese guy who did \u2018Hamlet\u2019 and played all the parts, so I suggested he do the same.\u201d\n\nMr. Efron played every character on the series, including both David and Goliath and the voice of God. At least one episode began with a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that the show \u201cmay not be suitable for adults;\u201d nonetheless, the dialogue was often laden with Easter eggs for older viewers, including references to Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d and Meredith Willson\u2019s \u201cThe Music Man.\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019ve got trouble, right here in Nineveh City.\u201d)\n\nThe series received an award from a Protestant church council, Olsen said, and resulted in a book co-written by her and Mr. Efron: \u201cBible Stories You Can\u2019t Forget, No Matter How Hard You Try.\u201d\n\nMarshall Harold Efron was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 3, 1938. His father was an accountant, his mother a homemaker. \u201cSchool wasn\u2019t much fun for me,\u201d he told the New York Times in 1971, explaining that he was picked on for being short and heavyset. \u201cI started being funny as a kid to avoid being pushed around.\u201d\n\nMr. Efron graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles, received a master\u2019s degree in English from the University of California at Berkeley in 1964, and spent one year in law school before turning to acting. He also connected with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and was described in Tom Wolfe\u2019s book on that group, \u201cThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,\u201d as \u201cthe round Mercury of Hip California.\u201d\n\nIn 1967, he moved to New York, where he appeared in Broadway productions of \u201cThe Great White Hope\u201d and \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing.\u201d He was also featured at radio station WBAI, where he hosted a program called \u201cSatirical View\u201d and sometimes filled in for broadcaster Steve Post.\n\nAfter student protesters at Columbia University began occupying buildings on campus in 1968, Mr. Efron and fellow humorist Paul Krassner pretended to be young radicals \u201cliberating\u201d the station\u2019s airwaves. Some listeners apparently failed to recognize the joke.\n\n\u201cWithin an hour police arrived at the studios, having received reports of a student takeover and of my detention as a hostage in WBAI\u2019s bathroom,\u201d Post later wrote in a memoir. (Mr. Efron, he added, later called in from a Manhattan telephone booth to play the role of Spiro T. Agnew, the vice president-elect, in an improvised \u201cinterview\u201d in which he announced plans to \u201copen a Cabinet seat for the Department of Astrology.\u201d)\n\nMr. Efron\u2019s radio work resulted in an offer to join \u201cDream Machine.\u201d \u201cIf you got high,\u201d executive producer Jack Willis recalled in an interview for WNET, \u201cit was a great show to watch.\u201d\n\nAmong many other sketches, Mr. Efron once explored the intricacies of olive grading, in which olives are variously labeled large, extra large, mammoth, giant, jumbo, colossal and supercolossal. Gargantua olives, he joked, came one per can.\n\nHe also appeared in director George Lucas\u2019s feature film debut, the science-fiction thriller \u201cTHX 1138\u201d (1971), and did voice work for movies including \u201cIce Age: The Meltdown\u201d (2006) and \u201cHorton Hears a Who!\u201d (2008), as well as cartoon series such as \u201cKidd Video,\u201d \u201cThe Biskitts\u201d and \u201cThe Smurfs,\u201d as Sloppy Smurf.\n\nSurvivors include a sister.\n\nOn \u201cDream Machine,\u201d Mr. Efron instructed viewers on the art of writing their own famous last words, which he described as \u201cthe final chance for you to correct the gross impression you\u2019ve been leaving of yourself all over town.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what words he ultimately selected for himself. Presumably, he followed the advice he issued decades earlier, seated between two ferns and smiling for the camera: \u201cSpeak clearly. Make sure your mouth is empty. Remove all tubes if you have to. Have a pleasant, open attitude. Don\u2019t be cranky.\u201d", "description": "He was an irreverent humorist who also retold Bible stories on a Sunday morning CBS series.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Vkrb32vLDF_83r93lNTMNDshb3E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OQP2LOXKZQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
