There\u2019s a handful, approximately three.\u201d\n\nThe talking points added that the president had not offered a direct \"quid pro quo\" deal and there was no \u201cmysterious \u2018promise\u2019\u201d made to Mr Zelensky, a point made by several Fox News hosts throughout the day including Bret Baier who said \u201cTo the president\u2019s point, you don\u2019t see a direct quid pro quo in the language tying this to that\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president released the transcript of a phone call between himself and Mr Zelensky amid allegations the White House had withheld financial aid from the eastern European country to pressure them into investigating Donald Trump\u2019s possible rival in the 2020 presidential race \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden - and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe White House has claimed Mr Biden meddled in the sacking of prosecutor general Viktor Shokin who was investigating firm Burisma Holdings, of which Hunter was a board member, to protect his son \u2013 claims strongly denied by the Obama-era VP, who was one of many world leaders to call for the Ukrainian official\u2019s removal.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
