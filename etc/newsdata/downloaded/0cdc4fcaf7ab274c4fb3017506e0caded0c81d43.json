As we drove past the abandoned ball, the little one came bursting and trumpeting out at us, kicking up sand and throwing a bit of a tantrum, until we left the area and his toy alone.\n\n'If you ever come across such a sighting, stay longer, and always keep filming until you are out of the area and sure that no more action is to come out of the sighting.'", "description": "The baby pachyderm spins and kicks the makeshift ball with her feet as he shows off for tourists in the\u00a0Sabi Sand Game Reserve in South Africa.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19437168-0-image-a-45_1570529433199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
