Egyptian officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nEven if lighthearted, Mr. Trump\u2019s quip drew attention to an uncomfortable facet of the U.S.-Egypt relationship.\n\nMr. Sisi has drawn criticism for his authoritarian rule since taking power following a 2013 coup. Under Mr. Sisi, Egyptian authorities have been accused of detaining thousands of political opponents, of torturing and killing prisoners and of stymying political opposition, according to reports by the United Nations, U.S. State Department and nongovernmental groups.\n\nThe White House hasn\u2019t publicly admonished the Egyptian government for its human-rights record. Egypt has defended its actions, saying it is fighting extremists.\n\nMr. Trump has extolled his ties to other world leaders known for authoritarian methods, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAt this year\u2019s G-7 summit, at least 10 U.S. and three Egyptian officials were awaiting Mr. Sisi\u2019s arrival on the morning of Aug. 26 when the president made his remark.\n\nAmong those in attendance were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and then-national security adviser John Bolton, who since has resigned. Others included Larry Kudlow, assistant to the president for economic policy; Rob Blair, a senior adviser to the White House chief of staff and an interpreter.\n\nEgyptian officials in the room included Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry and Abbas Kamel, Egypt\u2019s chief of the General Intelligence Service, the witnesses said.\n\nWithin minutes of the quip, Mr. Sisi met Mr. Trump and reporters were allowed in. Mr. Trump, among other comments, celebrated his relationship with Mr. Sisi, noting that the two leaders had begun talking with each other soon after Mr. Trump won the presidential election in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe understood each other very well. He\u2019s a very tough man, I will tell you that. But he\u2019s also a good man, and he\u2019s done a fantastic job in Egypt. Not easy,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who in 2017 hosted Mr. Sisi\u2019s first White House visit since Mr. Sisi took power. Constitutional amendments, passed by parliament earlier this year, allow Mr. Sisi to serve multiple terms.\n\nIn a press release after the bilateral meeting, Egypt gave no hint of any tension.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump expressed his appreciation for Egypt and President El Sisi as well as the development that Egypt has witnessed to realize security and stability as well as growth, in spite of regional instability,\u201d the Egyptian presidency\u2019s office said in a statement afterward.\n\nWrite to Nancy A.
