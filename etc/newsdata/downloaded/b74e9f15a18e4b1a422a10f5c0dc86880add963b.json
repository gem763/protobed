Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is the place where America\u2019s modern journey began, so it was a fitting final stop on her travels.\n\nPhiladelphia is the place where the Founding Fathers of the United States met; where, in 1776, they signed the Declaration of Independence; and, in 1787, the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWandering around Philly you can feel its historic importance\u201d, explains Laetitia. \u201cThe streets are perfect for an afternoon stroll, exploring iconic locations like the house of Betsy Ross, creator of the first American flag, and the pretty cobbled streets of Elfreth\u2019s Alley.\n\nPhiladelphia has a list of illustrious firsts: it has America\u2019s first hospital, theatre, daily newspaper, computer and even zoo. This precociousness is in keeping with the pioneering spirit in which it was founded by William Penn, a Quaker who, having experienced religious persecution, wanted the city to be a tolerant place that was unafraid to do things differently. Its name is even derived from the Ancient Greek words for brother (adelph\u00f3s) and beloved (philos).\n\nToday tolerance and innovation are still visible everywhere, from big sights such as the city\u2019s Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol of American independence, to community gems, like the Magic Gardens.\n\nThe Philly Cheesesteak\n\nAlong with the Liberty Bell and \u201cRocky\u201d films, the Philly cheesesteak is one of the most well-known things to come out of the Pennsylvania city.\n\nA cheesesteak is a long bread roll, preferably an Italian Amoroso roll, filled with saut\u00e9ed rib eye beef and melted cheese. Other toppings can include fried onions, mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, and hot or sweet peppers.\n\nThe cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Pat Olivieri, a hot dog vendor. Legend has it that it was a taxi driver that first requested the variant and, having sampled it, told Olivieri to leave hot dogs behind and focus on steak sandwiches.\n\nToday the cheesesteak has become an attraction of its own, with multiple renowned locations for visitors to sample and compare wares, open 24 hours a day.\n\nNot to be missed: a roundup of our favourite Philadelphia destinations\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia has it all\u201d says Laetitia. \u201cFrom its iconic history, to its culture and music. It has its own unique identity, carved out here on America\u2019s east coast, just waiting for you to explore.\u201d\n\nSo to help you get exploring, here are a selection of highlights from around the city.\n\n1.Philadelphia\u2019s Magic Gardens were created by Isaiah and Julia Zagar as part of a move to revitalise the city\u2019s South Street neighbourhood. Working with other members of the community, they transformed the area into a haven for artists, giving rise to the term \u201cSouth Street Renaissance\u201d. The Magic Gardens is home to beautiful mosaics made out of found objects, an outdoor sculpture labyrinth and indoor galleries and, like Laetitia, you won\u2019t be able to resist being sucked into the energy of the place.\n\n2. The Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution were both signed at Philadelphia\u2019s Independence Hall, so this national monument is quite properly the place where the USA\u2019s current story began. On one site you can visit the hall itself, as well as the Benjamin Franklin Museum and the world-famous Liberty Bell, rung in its time by slavery abolitionists and advocates for women\u2019s suffrage.\n\n3.The Milkboy Cafe is a bar, restaurant, music venue, a world famous recording studio, and, as Laetitia discovered, the perfect place to get over jet lag. Located on the corner of 11th and Chestnut, Milkboy opens at 7 in the morning and doesn\u2019t close its doors until the late night music scene draws to a close. It caters for every taste, offering three meals a day and every snack in between.\n\n4. In this city every spare wall is a potential canvas. \u201dI loved the huge murals in the city centre,\u201d said Laetitia. In fact, it was the Mural Arts Philadelphia project that transformed Philadelphia into one of the world\u2019s largest art galleries. Iit has created more than 3,600 city murals since 1984, uniting artists and local communities. Explore them on your own or with a guided tour.\n\n5.Reading Terminal Market was established in 1893 and is housed in a building that has become a national historic landmark. You will not go hungry when you visit: indeed, you may struggle to choose between the array of foods available, including locally-sourced meat and poultry, seafood, cheese and baked goods.\n\nSoundtrack of a city\n\nWe\u2019ve put together a locally inspired soundtrack to accompany your visit to Philly.\n\n\u2022 The obvious place to start is with Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d (1994), written for the 1993 film Philadelphia.\n\n\u2022 Bill Haley and the Comets released \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d in 1954, and it quickly became one of the most important records in rock\u2019n\u2019roll history.\n\n\u2022 The Clara Ward Singers built on Clara Mae Ward\u2019s success as a gospel singer and released a number of pop singles, including 1972\u2019s \u201cLean on Me\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Try an emotional ballad from R&B group, Boyz II Men: \u201cEnd of the Road\u201d (1994) is as good a place as any to start\n\n\u2022 Sarah McLachlan\u2019s hit single \u201cI Will Remember You\u201d (1995) was written by Philadelphia-born S\u00e9amus Egan\n\n\u2022 \u201cIs This Love?\u201d (2005) By Philadelphia indie-rock band, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah\u00a8\n\n\u2022 Rocky\u2019s theme: Bill Conti\u2019s \u201cGonna Fly Now\u201d, is another iconic song for Philly, which highlights the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n\u2022 No Philadelphia playlist would be complete without a song by legendary jazz musician, John Coltrane. \u201cPsalm\u201d (1964), from the album A Love Supreme, is an excellent example.", "description": "French singer-songwriter Laetitia Sheriff is travelling around the US on the trail of music, history and culture.
