It\u2019s a classic dual-use kind of technology.\u201d\n\nMILLIONAIRES GIVE UCLA $20 MILLION TO STUDY KINDNESS\n\nDigital rights organizations like Fight for the Future have long said that Silicon Valley's calls for regulation of facial recognition are a \"trap,\" meant to ultimately enable the tech's spread and advance tech giants' profit margins.\n\n\u201cAmazon wants to write the laws governing facial recognition to make sure they\u2019re friendly to their surveillance-driven business model,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, in a statement. \u201cBut this type of technology is uniquely dangerous. It poses a profound threat to the future of human liberty that can\u2019t be mitigated by industry-friendly regulations.\n\nFacial recognition technology, which has been slammed by civil liberties advocates and liberal lawmakers, is already being used by dozens of law enforcement agencies across the country. Several cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, have banned the technology from being used by police departments. Some states are now considering bans, too.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon defended the technology in a blog post: \u201cNew technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse. Instead, there should be open, honest, and earnest dialogue among all parties involved to ensure that the technology is applied appropriately and is continuously enhanced.\u201d\n\nINCA CHILD SACRIFICE VICTIMS CAME FROM ALL OVER THE EMPIRE, SCIENTISTS SAY\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, Greer's group sees the issue differently.\n\n\"We need to draw a line in the sand and ban governments from using this technology before it\u2019s too late. We know that members of Congress are currently drafting legislation related to facial recognition, and we hope they know that the public will not accept trojan horse regulations that line Jeff Bezos\u2019 pockets at the expense of all of our basic human rights,\" Greer said.", "description": "An activist group pushing for a federal ban on facial recognition blasted Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over comments this week about the company's efforts to write its own regulations for the controversial technology.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0298b3a3f74f4fb79f0fb4158ae3705dw-c0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
