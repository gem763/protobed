(Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press)\n\nTime and again over his 16 NFL seasons, Ben Roethlisberger has picked himself up, shaken off an injury and kept playing.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s loss to the Seattle Seahawks, however, it was apparent that Roethlisberger isn\u2019t indestructible. On Monday, Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin announced that the two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback would have elbow surgery and miss the remainder of the season.\n\nRoethlisberger \u201chad an MRI on his right elbow Sunday evening and it was determined by the Steelers\u2019 medical team that surgery will be required,\u201d Tomlin said in a statement. \u201cHe will be placed on our Reserve/Injured List and is out for the season.\u201d\n\n[Jerry Brewer: The NFL has a quarterback problem: It needs to figure out how to better protect them.]\n\nThe pain was obvious the moment Roethlisberger released a deep pass on the team\u2019s final drive of the first half on Sunday. He grabbed his elbow and briefly went to the locker room. He remained on the sideline for the second half, as the Steelers lost, 28-26, to fall to 0-2.\n\nHere's a video of the Ben Roethlisberger injury.pic.twitter.com/PsP1Z1Rhxy \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) September 15, 2019\n\nHe completed 8 of 15 passes for 75 yards before leaving with the injury, on a day when Saints quarterback Drew Brees was also seriously hurt.\n\nRoethlisberger called the surgery \u201cshocking and heartbreaking\" in a statement released Monday. He said he felt as though he was \u201cletting down so many people.\"\n\n\u201cI can only trust God\u2019s plan, but I am completely determined to battle through this challenge and come back stronger than ever next season,\u201d Roethlisberger said in the statement. \u201cThe Steelers committed three years to me this offseason and I fully intend to honor my contract and reward them with championship level play.\u201d\n\nThe statement later concluded: \u201cI love this game, my teammates, the Steelers organization and fans, and I feel in my heart I have a lot left to give.\u201d\n\nOver the last few years, Roethlisberger has publicly talked about retirement, with every word spoken about his future creating a stir. He also has been mindful about the long-term toll that concussions may have taken on him, once saying that \u201cI hope my son plays golf.\u201d And yet, perhaps spurred by the Steelers trading up to take Oklahoma State quarterback Mason Rudolph in the third round of the 2018 NFL draft, Roethlisberger has also insisted that the end of his career isn\u2019t near. Not long after that draft, he said he intends to play for \u201cthree to five more years,\u201d relegating Rudolph to heir apparent status \u2014 until Sunday.\n\nIn Roethlisberger\u2019s absence, Rudolph completed 12 of 19 passes for 112 yards and two touchdowns. Although Rudolph seems ready to play, his backup is now an open question after the Steelers last week traded Josh Dobbs, their top backup last year, to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had previously lost starter Nick Foles to a broken collarbone. Steelers rookie Devlin Hodges is expected to be promoted from the practice squad to back up Rudolph. Roethlisberger, who did not speak with reporters after the game, typically rests on Wednesdays, a tradition that helped Rudolph feel comfortable during Sunday\u2019s appearance.\n\n[Drew Brees, an NFL iron man, reportedly will have thumb surgery, miss about six weeks]\n\n\u201cYou gotta be prepared for those situations whenever your number is called,\u201d Rudolph told reporters. \u201cI thought I was ready. I had a really good feel for the game plan \u2026 I had a lot of reps this week, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was unprepared, by any means.\u201d\n\nTomlin noted Sunday that Rudolph has \u201cbeen a part of this thing. He\u2019s the backup quarterback. We\u2019re capable of functioning in a very normal manner when he\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\nHis teammates also said they had the 24-year-old\u2019s back after Sunday\u2019s loss. \u201cMason did a really, really, really good job today,\u201d tight end Vance McDonald said, via the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. \u201cI was really, really, really impressed,\u201d guard David DeCastro added.\n\nThe transition to Rudolph will play out on national television, with the Steelers set for four prime-time appearances in their next eight games. They\u2019re scheduled to appear twice on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d and once each on the Sunday and Thursday night telecasts. Already two games behind the first-place Baltimore Ravens, the Steelers visit the 2-0 San Francisco 49ers on Sunday before making their prime time debut on Sept. 30 against the winless Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nAnd Pittsburgh is entering unfamiliar ground without the veteran Roethlisberger. Over the course of his career, the 37-year-old quarterback has missed 20 games, with 16 coming because of injuries and four from his 2010 suspension for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy. He missed four games in 2015 with a sprained MCL, three in 2012 with a shoulder injury, one in 2011 with an ankle injury, one in 2009 with a concussion, one in 2016 with an ankle injury, one in 2006 after an appendectomy, four in 2005 with a right knee injury and one in 2004 with a rib injury.\n\nSince Roethlisberger became the starter in 2004, the Steelers have gone 11-9 in games he\u2019s missed. But this season, they\u2019re winless after losses to the New England Patriots and Seahawks, their first 0-2 start since 2013, when they finished 8-8. Last season, they started 0-1-1, with a tie against the Browns and a loss to the Chiefs, and finished a half-game out of the second AFC wild-card spot.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nHow to replace Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger in your fantasy football lineups\n\nJohn Clayton: Can any of the NFL\u2019s 0-2 teams make a playoff run?\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you\n\nSaints fans cry foul after yet another bad call: \u2018We just want answers\u2019\n\nCancer survivor David Quessenberry catches touchdown pass for the Titans\n\nAntonio Brown scores in Patriots debut, leaves locker room before reporters arrive\n\nFire breaks out on field before Titans\u2019 home opener", "description": "The Steelers quarterback has missed only 16 games in his career because of injuries.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
