From all of the effort cast members put into making guests feel special to the inner working of the locations themselves, these are 20 things you probably didn\u2019t know about the Disney parks.\n\nDisney is just one big never-ending show.\n\ncaption Disney World\u2019s Christmas Day parade marches down Main Street. source Jeff Kern/ Flickr\n\nWhen guests step foot in any Disney park, they are really stepping into a live show where everything from the costumes to the trash cans play a part. Disney even has their own lingo, which is why you may realize that visitors are called \u201cguests\u201d and workers are \u201ccast members.\u201d When you walk through the streets of a park you are \u201constage,\u201d and for the most part, \u201cbackstage\u201d remains hidden.\n\nNothing should compromise the feeling that Disney guests are a part of the show. If a cast member is dressed in their work clothing, they are not even allowed to cross a certain the line from their section of the park into the next because it would make no sense to see someone from the future (Tomorrowland) walking around the Old West (Frontierland).\n\nMagic Kingdom sits on top of a set of tunnels.\n\ncaption The tunnels below Magic Kingdom were built at ground level because of an elevated water table in Florida. source The Walt Disney Company\n\nMany people don\u2019t realize that when they are standing on Main Street, they are actually on the second level of Magic Kindgom and working their way up to the third when they head for Cinderella\u2019s castle. This is because the park sits on top of a set of tunnels known as the utilidors where cast members can walk around freely without ruining the \u201cshow.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re really itching to get a look at these not-so-secret tunnels, you can sign up to take a backstage tour for a pretty penny, but prepare to be rather unimpressed. The utilidors aren\u2019t exactly what you would call magical, but you can get a look at all they have to offer for cast members from the cafeteria to a barbershop.\n\nThere\u2019s a strict \u201cDisney Look\u201d that cast members have to follow.\n\ncaption The name tag always goes on the left side, over a cast member\u2019s heart. source The Walt Disney Company\n\nCast members are expected to maintain a specific appearance known as the \u201cDisney Look.\u201d Extreme hairstyles, over-the-top makeup, visible tattoos, and body piercings beyond the earlobes are strictly prohibited. If you\u2019re a male with facial hair prior to starting at Disney, you can keep it as long as it is neatly trimmed, but if you were clean-shaven when you got hired then say goodbye to switching up your look.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to be cast as a character, you must meet strict requirements when it comes to looks. People interested in playing Mickey Mouse should be no taller than 5-foot-2-inches. Given this height requirement, chances are the person behind the Mickey Mouse costume is actually a woman.\n\nDisney is actually one of the cleanest places on earth.\n\ncaption As an added bonus, some custodial team members can be seen creating characters with just their brooms and water. source Disney Parks\n\nYou\u2019d expect a place that\u2019s crawling with sweaty tourists and sticky children to be extremely unsanitary, but Disney is actually one of the cleanest places you could ever visit. Everything in the park is hosed down on a nightly basis, rides and all. Plus, there are trash cans every couple of feet that are even decorated to blend in with their location. You may also notice that nothing is covered in gum and this is simply because Disney doesn\u2019t sell it, and for good reason.\n\nWhile custodial team members do most of the dirty work, all cast members are required to do their part to keep the parks clean. Cast members even learn the \u201cDisney Scoop,\u201d which is just a fancy way of saying they discreetly pick up trash.\n\nEveryone from the food service workers to the princesses must stay in character.\n\ncaption Author not pictured. source HarshLight/Flickr\n\nAll cast members must be committed to the Disney story, meaning if you work in Tomorrowland you better do everything it takes to convince guests that you\u2019re from the future. Children will do everything in their power to get you to admit that a character isn\u2019t real. Being able to think on your toes a necessary skill to possess if you want to be a cast member.\n\nThere are hidden Mickey\u2019s almost everywhere you turn.\n\ncaption Hidden Mickey spotted at the entrance to the Jungle Cruise. source Justin Callaghan/Flickr\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to one of the Disney parks, chances are you\u2019ve walked past countless hidden Mickey\u2019s without ever even noticing. Extreme Disney fans could probably spend their days just hunting them down, but if you want to spot some you\u2019ll have to look very closely. Although some won\u2019t be too difficult, others are so hidden that they\u2019ll take a serious detective\u2019s eye to get a glimpse.\n\nGuests who are interested in seeking out Hidden Mickey\u2019s on their next trip to Disney can purchase a guide book or download an app to help them out.\n\nCast members must sit through an 8-hour-long class just to learn about the history of The Walt Disney Company.\n\ncaption New cast members can be identified by a red \u201cearning my ears\u201d ribbon on their name tags. source Flickr/Darrell Taylor\n\nBefore they can head to the parks to start creating magic, all of the new cast members must report to Disney University for an 8-hour-long class known as \u201cTraditions.\u201d This is where you\u2019ll learn everything that you could possibly imagine about The Walt Disney Company, from history to magical moments, and even backstage secrets. You\u2019ll also get your first official tour of Magic Kingdom and the \u201csecret\u201d tunnels that are found below it.\n\nAlthough it may seem long and tedious, it\u2019s all worth it at the end of the day when you \u201cearn your ears.\u201d And yes, this also means an actual pair of your very own Mickey ears.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to create magical moments.\n\ncaption Cast members create magic every day. source Disney Parks\n\nMagical moments are by far the best reason to work for Disney. Not only does it embody what the company is all about, but there is nothing quite like going home after a long day knowing that you made a family feel special. Cast members are encouraged to create spur-of-the-moment acts of kindness. This could be anything from surprising a child with free ice cream to upgrading a family\u2019s hotel reservation.\n\nMagical moments shouldn\u2019t be planned or demanded, they just happen. They also shouldn\u2019t be given out all of the time, but on a good day of work, it\u2019s hard to stop yourself from making others feel special.\n\nMost of the parks offer Extra Magic Hours.\n\ncaption Avoid large crowds by taking advantage of Extra Magic Hours. source xiquinhosilva/Flickr\n\nDifferent parks offer Extra Magic Hours on different days, giving Disney Resort guests a little extra time to enjoy themselves. Magic Kingdom\u2019s late-night hours are offered up until 2 or 3 a.m. typically on a Saturday or Sunday, so guests can enjoy the park without any crowds. Not to mention that this is probably the most beautiful time to see all of Magic Kingdom.\n\nJanuary is the best time to visit.\n\ncaption Avoid summer months if you don\u2019t want to spend hours waiting in line. source Brett Kiger/Getty Images\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for reasonable crowds, temperatures, and prices, you should consider taking a trip to Disney World sometime in January. Especially during the last two weeks of the month. At this point, the holidays are over and guests have already made their way back home for school, meaning you won\u2019t spend your days waiting in long lines.\n\nThe entire month of September is also a great option, but be prepared for high temperatures in Orlando, and possibly lots of rain.\n\nWorking as a seasonal cast member is challenging, yet rewarding.\n\ncaption Orlando, Florida.

As a seasonal worker, you might get dealt some of the worst hours. In my experience, closing every night was the norm.\n\nStanding for that many hours in the heat while you deal with large crowds is exhausting and there are also lots of rules to follow, but that\u2019s what happens when there are thousands of employees to manage.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s challenging work, it\u2019s all worth it when you\u2019re able to say you were a part of the magic at Disney World.\n\nThe perks are worth all of the tough work.\n\ncaption Cast members get free entry into the parks. source Disney Parks\n\nIt may not always be the magical work you\u2019d expect, but the perks you get as a cast member make up for any of the downsides. Cast members receive free park tickets for themselves and up to three guests, sneak previews of new attractions, discounts within Disney and at surrounding business, and much more.\n\nCast members also get exclusive access to what can be considered a Disney shopper\u2019s paradise at Cast Connection and Property Control. Head to one side of the building and you\u2019ll find Cast Connection where cast members and up to 6 guests can shop discontinued or overstocked Disney merchandise at prices of up to 75% off. Located on the other side is Property Control where cast members (no guests) can purchase broken merchandise and unclaimed lost and found items from the parks.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is one of the best companies to work your way up, but you\u2019ll probably have to start in a position you don\u2019t necessarily love.\n\ncaption Casey\u2019s Corner is the latest restaurant to stay open in Magic Kingdom. source The Walt Disney Company\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely possible to go from working 3 a.m. closing shifts at Casey\u2019s Corner to landing a VP role, I\u2019ve seen it happen, but it\u2019ll take some serious time. Seniority is a big deal when it comes to Disney so the longer you\u2019ve been working for them, the better your chances of landing a top spot.\n\nOnce a cast member has been working in a position for at least six months they are free to move around, even if the desired role has nothing to do with the role they were previously in.\n\nCast members are never allowed to point with one finger.\n\ncaption Cast members should always point with two fingers or their entire hand. source Josh Grenier/Flickr\n\nGiven that guests travel from all over the world just to vacation at Disney, it is important for everyone working in the parks to be sensitive to different cultures. This is where \u201cThe Disney Point\u201d comes in. Cast members must only point with either two fingers, or their entire palm \u2013 an action that is ingrained into the workers\u2019 minds during \u201cTraditions\u201d and official training.\n\nLegend also has it that Walt Disney was often pictured pointing with two fingers as he walked around an unfinished Disneyland.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is not an acceptable answer.\n\ncaption Walt Disney World Festival of Fantasy parade. source Jennifer Lynn/Flickr\n\nWorking at Disney means you\u2019re bound to be asked what seems like never-ending questions and \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is never an acceptable answer. The most reasonable solution to dealing with this is to simply memorize every nook and cranny of the park from the minute you start working.\n\nMany guests will ask what time the 3:00 p.m. parade starts, and as wild as it may seem, this is actually a reasonable question. Although you may be inclined to respond with the obvious 3 p.m., the correct answer is actually \u201cit depends on where you\u2019re at in the park.\u201d If you\u2019re standing on Main Street, be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes after the parade begins to get a glimpse of the magic.\n\nThe costumes can be pretty uncomfortable.\n\ncaption Standing in the Florida heat in a heavy costume is not exactly comfortable. source Walt Disney World/Facebook\n\nWearing a heavy wool softball costume or a polyester turtleneck in the middle of 100 degree days is not by any means ideal, and the character\u2019s costumes are even worse.\n\nThe Carousel of Progress will never shut down no matter how many changes are made to Magic Kingdom.\n\ncaption The Carousel of Progress started out in Disneyland before it was moved to Disney World. source Jennifer Lynn/Flickr\n\nThe Carousel of Progress in Magic Kingdom is one of the only attractions at Disney World to be created by Walt Disney himself. It\u2019s believed that this was actually his favorite ride, which is why it\u2019ll probably never be touched other than to undergo some light refurbishments.\n\nThe Disney tunes never end.\n\ncaption You\u2019ll probably know all of the lyrics to every Disney tune in one month\u2019s time. source Disney Parks\n\nIf you don\u2019t absolutely love Disney music, then working in the parks is probably not for you. \u201cLet it Go\u201d from \u201cFrozen\u201d can even be heard blasting through the cast member tunnels.\n\nChildren are never lost in Disney World.\n\ncaption Name tags make it easier for children to point out cast members that can help them find their parents. source Walt Disney World/Facebook\n\nChildren can never be lost in the happiest place on earth. If a cast member comes across a child who has been separated from their parent, then they must treat the situation as if it\u2019s the adult who\u2019s truly the lost one. This requires remaining calm and positive as not to upset the child any further than they might already be. You can still keep the magic of Disney alive while searching for the child\u2019s parents.\n\nIf a cast member is approached by an adult who can\u2019t find their child, they should immediately call the \u201cLost Child\u201d number to alert other cast members to be on the lookout. Cast members are aware that Disney World can be quite a distracting place for children, but all workers know the best steps to take in order to reunite a family.\n\nThere\u2019s a special treat for guests that arrive before the park opens and leave after it closes.\n\ncaption \u201cThe Kiss Goodnight\u201d reinforces the magic of Disney. source YANLEI LI/Shutterstock\n\nGuests should arrive before the park officially opens if they want to receive a proper welcome. Mickey Mouse, followed by many other beloved Disney characters make their way out into the park to greet the guests and kick off the day with a little extra excitement.\n\nIf you can survive the heat and exhaustion, you should also consider staying late into the evening. Not many guests are aware that the magic continues even after the park closes. Following the fireworks, those still remaining in Magic Kingdom can catch watch Cinderella\u2019s castle light up for \u201cThe Kiss Goodnight.\u201d Although it\u2019s nothing too fancy, it\u2019s the park\u2019s special way of saying goodbye to guests after a long day.", "description": "Business Insider - An inside look at Disney and all of its secrets proves that there's more magic to the parks than meets the eye..
