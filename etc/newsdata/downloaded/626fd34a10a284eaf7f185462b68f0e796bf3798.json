Barr is said to have refused to intercede.\n\nFirtash, who has been fighting extradition to the U.S. on bribery and corruption charges from Vienna for more than five years, had only recently hired Toensing and diGenova at the time of the reported meeting. According to Bloomberg, he paid them $1 million earlier this year to dig up dirt on Biden in a bid to get Giuliani\u2019s help with his legal woes.\n\nWhile Giuliani has maintained he never had anything to do with Firtash\u2019s case, Firtash reportedly bankrolled at least one piece of opposition research that Giuliani would later hold up on cable news as proof of Biden\u2019s wrongdoing: a witness statement from Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general, claiming the former vice president had him fired to protect his son from a corruption investigation.\n\nGiuliani told the Post that he \u201cdid sort of look at Firtash to see if he had any relevant information\u201d that could help with his search for damaging information about Democrats. \u201cAs far as I can tell, he didn\u2019t. I looked at maybe 20 of these oligarchs.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said the Firtash case \u201chas the support of the department leadership\u201d and said DOJ would \u201ccontinue to work closely with the Austrian Ministry of Justice to extradite Mr. Firtash.\u201d Toensing reportedly declined to comment on the Barr meeting.\n\nThe Post also reports that prosecutors in Chicago who filed the bribery charges against Firtash in 2013 had previously come across two of Giuliani\u2019s recently arrested associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, in their case. Prosecutors there are now said to be reviewing whether there is a larger relationship between Firtash and the Soviet-born businessmen accused of campaign finance violations.\n\nParnas and Fruman, who were reportedly enlisted by Giuliani to help find dirt on Trump\u2019s political opponents in Ukraine, are accused of making an illicit campaign donation in a bid to have the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed.\n\nGiuliani claimed he did not know whether Firtash, Parnas, and Fruman had a relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business,\u201d he told the Post. Lawyers for Parnas and Fruman have not publicly spoken about their clients\u2019 potential ties to Firtash.\n\nFirtash reportedly hired both Toensing and diGenova this summer at the recommendation of Parnas, who is said to have worked as a translator for Toensing and diGenova in the Firtash case.\n\nA Toensing and diGenova spokesman said Firtash had \u201cno business relationship\u201d with Parnas or Fruman. \u201cNo money has been paid to Mr. Parnas by Mr. Firtash beyond his work as a translator for the law firm,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nParnas and Fruman were both arrested at a D.C. airport before they reportedly could board one-way flights to Vienna earlier this month. Giuliani told The Atlantic that he also intended on going to Vienna just one day after Parnas and Fruman were scheduled to depart the U.S.", "description": "Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova reportedly met with Trump\u2019s Attorney General on behalf of Dmitry Firtash at the height of Giuliani\u2019s pressure campaign in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2767,w_4920,x_0,y_143/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571799848/GettyImages-643418808_shi9am", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
