Police don't believe the latest shooting outside St. Albans Church of God in Christ was random.\n\nThe victim's father, who has a permit to carry, pulled out a handgun and returned fire as his son ran away. The Star Tribune reports officers following a trail of blood that led to the victim, who died at the scene next to his Bible.\n\nChurch elder Frank Frazier identified the victim as his cousin, 41-year-old RayVell Carter. Bystanders protected Carter's daughter, who's younger than 10, until police arrived. There have been no arrests.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
