It\u2019s not a fight he wants. In fact, no one with cognitive function wants this, but the Democratic Party has become infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome, so here we are; this plan has been in the works since 2016. They tried to get him on Russian collusion. They couldn\u2019t. The investigation by ex-Special Counsel Robert Mueller also torpedoed that whole circus and debunked the Steele dossier, compiled by an ex-MI6 spook Christopher Steele, which was the basis for the whole collusion charade. This was an opposition research project funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrats, by the way. So, they waited and now this whistleblower, who is reportedly a CIA agent, comes forward with a second-hand account that Trump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine unless they opened a corruption probe against Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, in July.\n\nThe White House released the transcript which debunked all of the juicy allegations. There was no quid pro quo. In fact, it appears as if the Ukrainians only found out about a U.S. foreign aid review a month after the call. Trump insists that other European nations should also contribute to the aid package.\n\nSo, the latest impeachment push is based on evidence even shoddier than the Russian collusion myth. And what\u2019s more, is that the Hunter Biden probe might have already begun months before Trump\u2019s phone call. John Solomon has more (via Fox News) [emphasis mine]:\n\nA newly unearthed document shows that Ukrainian officials had opened a new probe into the firm linked to Hunter Biden months before President Trump's phone call with that country's leader, Fox News contributor John Solomon reported late Tuesday. Solomon said Tuesday on \"Hannity\" that the U.S. government knew Ukraine was planning to look again into activities at Burisma Holdings, an energy company that employed then-Vice President Joe Biden's son as a member of its board of directors, early this year. The report is noteworthy because President Trump has been accused by Democrats of threatening in July to withhold foreign aid to Ukraine unless its new president pursued an investigation into the company and the younger Biden's role there. \"The U.S. government had open-source intelligence and was aware as early as February of 2019 that the Ukrainian government was planning to reopen the Burisma investigation,\" he claimed. \"This is long before the president ever imagined having a call with President Zelensky,\" he added, noting Petro Poroshenko was still Ukraine's president at that time. [\u2026] Solomon said the information he obtained, including documents shown on \"Hannity\" Tuesday, was omitted from a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower's complaint lodged against Trump last month. Solomon said that NABU -- an FBI-like anti-corruption agency in Ukraine -- requested the probe into Burisma and owner Mykola Zlochevsky be reopened earlier this year. The investigation then went forward, Solomon said. The new probe later resulted in a \"Notice of Suspicion\" being filed, alleging the existence of \"illicit funds\" running through the firm, Solomon also claimed.\n\nHunter was with Burisma, being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month despite having zero experience in the energy sector. The whistleblower report is riddled with errors and this person did not listen in on the call. This person was also cited for being politically biased against the president, being a registered Democrat and working for a 2020 Democratic candidate. The complaint wasn\u2019t even released to Congress before the impeachment inquiry began. Yeah, no one read it before the Left pulled the trigger, so you know they\u2019re taking this seriously.\n\nAnd now this\u2026we\u2019ll just have to see what happens. As of now, the Trump White House has rightfully told House Democrat to shove it, refusing to cooperate in their kangaroo court that is politically motivated and intended to overturn the results of the 2016 election.", "description": ".10/09/2019 14:28:09PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/281/0a0e6ed4-fa19-4413-b063-6802b8bfba0a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
