Lightening products--from creams, soaps, and lotions--are commonplace on bedside tables and bathroom counters, despite reports finding that many of them contain toxic amounts of mercury.\n\nThe metal has become a standard ingredient in cosmetics and skincare products because of its ability to act like bleach, according to Bloomberg. The Aug. 28 report states that the mercury market earns about $20 billion a year, in large part because of the beauty industry.\n\nWhile mercury is also found in branded products, they\u2019re more common in cheap counterfeit versions. Take Goree Beauty Cream with Lycopene, for example. A jar worth just $5 was found to have 23,000 parts per million (ppm) of mercury, according to an X-ray fluorescence analyser used by the Philippine-based EcoWaste Coalition. Another product by the same brand Goree Day and Night Whitening Cream contains 19,900ppm.\n\nThese creams are banned in the Philippines but local sellers still offer them online. Similar products are also available around the world through eBay, Amazon, and Facebook. Most don\u2019t explicitly say that they contain mercury. The label on Chinese cream Feique simply reads \u201ccontains minerals,\u201d when it actually contains up to 19,200ppm of mercury, the EcoWaste Coalition found.\n\nMercury can lighten skin but the aftermath is not glamorous. It can reportedly lead to discoloured skin, anxiety, depression, and nerve or kidney damage.\n\nVarious organisations are now trying to curb the trend. In November 2018, the Minamata Convention on Mercury had 128 countries sign an agreement that ensures that the \u201cmanufacture, import or export\u201d of products with any trace of mercury will be banned after 2020.\n\nSkin whitening products are huge in Asia, with many risking their lives for the promise of lighter skin. A report by Global Industry Analysts Inc. from March 2018 projected the market for skin lighteners to reach $31.2 billion by 2024 because of demand from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nIn 2004, the World Health Organization found that nearly 40 percent of women in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and South Korea use skin lightening products frequently. In India, over 61 percent of the skincare market is made up of these sorts of products.\n\n\n\nSome governments have even started to address the issue. In July, Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Climate Change declared a nationwide crackdown on whitening creams that use an \u201cexcessive amount of mercury.\u201d\n\nSingapore\u2019s Health Sciences Authority, meanwhile, called on the public to stop the use of products like Goree Beauty Cream last year following a report that tagged eighteen beauty products to have high-levels of mercury. They told people to avoid them at all costs.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Whitening creams are popular across Asia, where light skin is generally perceived as more beautiful.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f4fedfffff30008de1af0/lede/1567578449119-2019-09-03.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7489xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*"}
