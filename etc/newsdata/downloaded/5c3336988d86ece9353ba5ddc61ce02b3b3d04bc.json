This will mean that I will not be able to attend public appointments every day in the coming months.\"\n\nSchwesig informed colleagues about her state of health during a Cabinet meeting of the regional government in Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Pomerania, a federal state in Germany's north. Schwesig has been the state premier since 2017 as well as the local party leader.\n\n\"After intensive discussions with my treating physicians, I am very confident that I will be able to fully recover again,\" the 45-year-old said. \"That is why I have decided to continue to hold the office of state premier and party leader here in the region [of Mecklenburg-Pomerania].\" However, Schwesig added, that it was \"also clear that in the coming months I will have to concentrate my energies on Mecklenburg-Pomerania, my health and my family. Therefore I will resign from office at national level.\"\n\nEarlier in June, Germany's Social Democrats picked Schwesig together with her party colleagues Malu Dreyer and Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel to act as a trio of interim leaders, following former leader Andrea Nahles' decision to step down and leave politics. It is not yet clear whether the party will pick a successor to Schwesig or continue with a dual leadership until its party congress in early December, where the Social Democrats will vote on a new future leadership.\n\nThe SPD, the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, suffered heavy losses at May's European Parliament election and barely clung to power in a regional election in Bremen. The party is polling at historic lows, achieving just 13.5 percent in recent polls.", "description": "Manuela Schwesig is one of three lawmakers currently co-leading the SPD.", "authors": ["Judith Mischke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1153442560-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
