Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nThere has never been an American leader who talks quite like President Trump. Everyone is familiar with his idiosyncratic style of public speaking: unusual in its crudeness, repetitive and lacking specificity. It turns out his private communications aren\u2019t so different \u2014 and that may be what ultimately ensnares him in the biggest scandal of his presidency.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the White House released a rough transcript of a private July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That conversation had been the subject of controversy days after a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that Trump had made comments that were a possible violation of campaign finance law.\n\nThe president suggested that the memo recording the call would exonerate him, describing it as \u201cperfect\u201d in a tweet before its release. His allies claimed there was nothing scandalous in the call; that the real scandal were the leaks about it. But when the document came out, it provoked a storm of outrage \u2014 particularly from Democrats who have already pledged to begin an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nIn the readout of their private conversation, Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate the conduct of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden. He also asked for help in finding Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server in Ukraine and asserted that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation started in the country.\n\nWhen Zelensky asked about buying U.S. missiles, Trump spoke of a favor he needed. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d the American president said. Later, Trump invited the Ukrainian leader to the White House.\n\nThe conversation was startling to Trump\u2019s rivals and legal observers. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said the call \u201creads like a classic mob shakedown.\u201d Eli Honig, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, claimed that if he saw the remarks in a regular criminal case he\u2019d think: \u201cWow, I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re discussing this so openly and clearly.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard Trump\u2019s private remarks to a world leader, nor the first time they\u2019ve raised eyebrows. From the start of his presidency, accounts of Trump\u2019s calls to world leaders have offered a window into his private thoughts \u2014 with some interesting differences with his public declarations.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say that to the press,\u201d Trump said repeatedly, according to a transcript of the Jan. 27 call with then-Mexican President \u00adEnrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto as he continued to make defiant statements. Trump, only days into office, was pressuring Pe\u00f1a Nieto to stop saying that Mexico would never pay for the wall, while admitting he knew that funding would come from other sources.\n\nHe sparred with Australia\u2019s Malcolm Turnbull in a call the next day, clashing over an agreement concerning refugees. \u201cI have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous,\u201d Trump said during that call (transcripts of both calls were later leaked to The Washington Post).\n\nNot all accounts of Trump\u2019s private behavior are leaked by worried officials, however. Sometimes, his counterparts make the revelations themselves. Former British prime minister Theresa May told a chat show that Trump\u2019s private advice on Brexit had been blunt. \u201cHe told me I should sue the E.U. \u2014 not go into negotiations,\u201d according to May\u2019s recollection.\n\nIn some cases, the comments are simply overheard. At the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, this summer, Trump called out in search of Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. \u201cWhere\u2019s my favorite dictator?\u201d the U.S. president said loud enough for several people to overhear, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump has reportedly told the same story about North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un to world leaders so many times that it has damaged his standing with them. \u201cThe president, viewed from afar as a dangerous buffoon by his liberal critics, often elicits a similar response from other world leaders who deal with him up close,\u201d BuzzFeed News\u2019s Alberto Nardelli wrote of the reaction to Trump\u2019s anecdote.\n\nFor any other politician, the accounts of any one of these private remarks might be damaging. But Trump appears to be different. Yes, the president may say shocking things in private conversations with world leaders \u2014 but he says shocking things in public, too. He contradicts positions he has previously taken in public, but guess what? He does that in public statements, too, often on Twitter.\n\nHe also frequently appears to publicly hint at his private intentions. In June, around the time that he was pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden\u2019s son, he told ABC News in an interview that he would accept information about a rival from a foreign government.\n\nWhen Trump told ABC News that he would definitely accept dirt on a domestic political opponent from a foreign government, he was already actively engaged in seeking such dirt from Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/b5A71QSqJv \u2014 John Glaser (@jwcglaser) September 25, 2019\n\nThe White House is adamant that Trump did nothing wrong in his phone call with Zelensky. In talking points that were mistakenly emailed to House Democrats, the Trump administration claimed there was no quid pro quo and \u201cwhat the President actually talked about was entirely proper\u201d and the whistleblower complaint \u201cwas handled absolutely by the book.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky has engulfed him in another scandal, and his private conversations with other world leaders may only provide more to come. The public is aware of only a fraction of Trump\u2019s private conversations, and the administration has worked to keep some of his most sensitive ones, such as those with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, out of public view.\n\nThe release of private White House recordings of President Nixon helped turn public opinion against him during the Watergate scandal. If those tapes, which included racial slurs and paranoid rants, helped break down Nixon\u2019s rational facade, accounts of Trump\u2019s private conversations may do something just as revealing: Confirm that he was exactly who he appeared to be all along.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
