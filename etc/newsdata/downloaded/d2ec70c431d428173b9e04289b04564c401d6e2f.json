The country has been on edge since the April 21 attacks killed at least 258 people at three churches and three hotels.", "description": "A Sri Lankan motorist risks jail for complaining on Facebook that he had been given a traffic ticket because he is Buddhist.Amid a fierce debate on religious...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/wire-20036358-1571750280-947_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
