The New York Times reported then he was killed some time in the last two years.\n\nOn Saturday the White House said he was killed in \u201ca United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region\u201d. It did not say when or by which US force or agency. It has been reported that the CIA, rather than the US military, may have carried out the strike. The CIA did not comment on Saturday.\n\nReuters reported that an unnamed US official said Hamza was killed \u201cmonths ago\u201d and Trump was briefed at the time. The Associated Press cited \u201ca US official familiar with the case\u201d as saying the operation occurred within the past 18 months.\n\nThe official did not say what led to bin Laden\u2019s death being announced now.\n\nBin Laden, who was believed to be aged around 30, had been seeking to lead a resurgence of al-Qaida, which has been eclipsed among jihadist terrorist groups by Islamic State. The US state department designated him as a terrorist in 2017. The US offered a $1m reward for help tracking him down.\n\n\u201c[Al-Qaida was] clearly grooming him to be a next generation successor,\u201d Peter Bergen, director of the international security programme at the New America foundation, told the Guardian in July.\n\n\u201cAyman al-Zawahiri [al-Qaida\u2019s official leader] hasn\u2019t been a particularly effective leader. He\u2019s got a sort of charisma deficit. And they were trying to put this guy forward.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, using variant spellings of the Bin Laden name, that of the target\u2019s father and the group he led, a statement issued by the White House press secretary read: \u201cHamza bin Ladin, the high-ranking al-Qa\u2019ida member and son of Usama bin Ladin, was killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region.\u201d\n\nBin Laden\u2019s death, the statement said, \u201cdeprives al-Qa\u2019ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father\u201d and \u201cundermines important operational activities of the group\u201d.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cHamza bin Ladin was responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nOsama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Abbottabad, in Pakistan, in 2011.\n\nHamza bin Laden was the son of Khairiah Sabar, one of the former al-Qaida leader\u2019s three surviving wives who lived with him in the compound. Hamza bin Laden\u2019s last public message came in March 2018, threatening the Saudi Arabian regime. This year, he was stripped of Saudi citizenship.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement of the death of Hamza bin Laden came three days after the 18th anniversary of the 11 September attacks, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to post-9/11 illnesses.\n\nLast week, Trump announced the abandonment of peace talks between the Taliban, which sheltered al-Qaida leaders in the run-up to 9/11, the US and the Afghan government.\n\nIn the week of 9/11 commemorations, a mooted invitation to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, attracted widespread criticism.", "description": "Death of son of the al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, was reported but not confirmed in JulyIn this image from video released by the CIA, Hamza bin Laden is seen at his wedding.
