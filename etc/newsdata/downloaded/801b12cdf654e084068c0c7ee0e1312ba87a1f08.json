REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nBarcelona experienced its worst night of disturbances in decades on Friday as masked youths blocked roads with blazing garbage bins and hurled rocks at security forces, who responded by firing repeated rounds of smoke grenades and tear gas.\n\nCatalonia is a semi-autonomous region with some 7.5 million inhabitants who have their own language, parliament and flag. It is Spain\u2019s wealthiest region and Barcelona is the country\u2019s second largest city, drawing millions of tourists each year.\n\nRadical youth group Arran called for a fresh demonstration at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) against \u201cpolice violence\u201d and to call for the \u201cfreedom of all political prisoners\u201d.\n\nPolice said they feared renewed confrontations and advised shopkeepers in the city centre to close during the protest.\n\nTorra told reporters this week\u2019s violence did not reflect the peaceful nature of the traditional Catalan independence movement. \u201cWe urge the acting prime minister of the Spanish government to sit at a negotiating table to talk,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cViolence has never been and will never be our way.\u201d\n\nSome 300 people have been arrested in clashes that have flared throughout the region since Monday, when Spain\u2019s Supreme Court handed down lengthy prison terms to nine Catalan leaders who staged a banned referendum on independence in 2017.\n\nSpain\u2019s acting interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, blamed Catalan separatists for the violence and said security forces were dealing with the clashes in an appropriate manner\n\n\u201cThe situation is under control. There is serious, organised violence ... but I reiterate that we are not being overwhelmed,\u201d he said after visiting injured police in hospital.\n\nDIVISIVE ISSUE\n\nIndependence is a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, with a poll in July showing backing for secession at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3% of people against and 44% in favour.\n\nTorra, who earlier this week said Catalonia should hold a new vote on independence within two years, said on Saturday the will of the people would be respected: \u201cWe will go as far as the people of Catalonia want to go\u201d.\n\nThe Socialist caretaker government in Madrid did not immediately respond to Torra\u2019s call for talks, but the opposition conservative People\u2019s People (PP) dismissed the idea.\n\n\u201cIt is not time to call for dialogue, it is time to enforce the law and the Constitution,\u201d the PP\u2019s Pablo Casado said. \u201cWhen a violent minority attacks the critical infrastructures of the state it is not time to demand silence, but to demand order.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBarcelona\u2019s mayor Ada Colau, who does not support the secessionist movement, said Barcelona \u201cdoes not deserve what we are living through\u201d, adding that pavements had been torn up and hundreds of plastic garbage bins torched in the unrest.\n\nThree roads in the city remained closed on Saturday because of the damage, with some foreign visitors caught unawares by the chaos and shocked by what they saw.\n\n\u201cWe got here and were like \u2018Oh God\u2019.
