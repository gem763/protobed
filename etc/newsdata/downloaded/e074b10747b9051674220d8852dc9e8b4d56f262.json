It means escaping the transfer union that inevitably will be imposed as more EU nations suffer Greek-style fiscal chaos. And a real Brexit gives the UK leeway to adopt market-friendly policies that currently are impossible under the dirigiste rules imposed by Brussels.\n\nBut just because Johnson appears to be good on Brexit, this doesn\u2019t mean he deserves good grades in other areas. For instance, the UK-based Times reports that the Prime Minister is on a spending spree.\n\nBoris Johnson is planning to spend as much on public services as Jeremy Corbyn promised at the last election and cannot afford the tax cuts he pledged in the Tory leadership campaign, a think tank has warned. The prime minister\u2019s proposed spending spree would mean Sajid Javid, the chancellor, overshooting the government\u2019s borrowing limit by \u00a35 billion in 2020-21, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said that the government was \u201cadrift without any fiscal anchor\u201d.\n\nUgh, sounds like he may be the British version of Trump. Or Bush, or Nixon.\n\nIn a column for CapX, Ben Ramanauskas warns that more spending is bad policy.\n\n\u2026with Sajid Javid making a raft of spending announcements, it would seem as though the age of austerity really is over. \u2026So it would be useful to look back over the past decade and answer a few questions. Does austerity work? \u2026As explained in the excellent new book Austerity: When it Works and When it Doesn\u2019t by Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi, it depends what you mean by austerity. \u2026The authors analyse thousands of fiscal measures adopted by sixteen advanced economies since the late 1970s, and assess the relative effectiveness of tax increases and spending cuts at reducing debt. They show that\u2026spending cuts are much more successful than tax increases at reducing the growth of debt, and can sometimes even result in output gains, such as in the case of expansionary austerity. \u2026Which brings us onto our next question: did the UK actually experience austerity? \u2026the government\u2019s programme was a mild form of austerity. \u2026Then there is the politics of it all. It\u2019s important to remember that fiscal conservatism can be popular with the electorate and it worked well in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2010. The Conservatives should not expect to win the next election by promising massive increases in public spending.\n\nMoreover, good spending policy facilitates better tax policy.\n\nOr, in this case, the issue is that bad spending policy makes good tax policy far more difficult.\n\nAnd that isn\u2019t good news since the U.K. needs to improve its tax system, as John Ashmore explains in another CapX article.\n\n\u2026the Tax Foundation\u2026released its annual International Tax Competitiveness Index. The UK came 25th out of 36 major industrialised nations. For a country that aims to have one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies, that simply will not do. \u2026Conservatives\u2026should produce a comprehensive plan for a simpler, unashamedly pro-growth tax system. And it should be steeped in a political narrative about freedom\u2026 Rates are important, but so is overall structure and efficiency. \u2026a more generous set of allowances for investment, coupled with a reform of business rates would be a great place to start. We know the UK has a productivity problem, so it seems perverse that we actively discourages investment. \u2026As for simplicity, \u2026it\u2019s possible to drastically reduce the number of taxes paid by small businesses without having any effect on revenue. Accountants PwC estimate it takes 105 hours for the average UK business to file their taxes\u2026 Another area the UK falls down is property taxes, of which Stamp Duty Land Tax is the most egregious example. It\u2019s hard to find anyone who thinks charging a tax on people moving house is a good idea\u2026in the longer term there\u2019s no substitute for good, old-fashioned economic growth \u2013 creating the world\u2019s most competitive tax system would be a fine way to help deliver it.\n\nTo elaborate, a \u201cmore generous set of allowances for investment\u201d is the British way of saying that the tax code should shift from depreciation to expensing, which is very good for growth.\n\nAnd simplicity is also a good goal (we could use some of that on this side of the Atlantic).\n\nThe problem, of course, is that good reforms won\u2019t be easy to achieve if there\u2019s no plan to limit the burden of government spending.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know if Boris Johnson is genuinely weak on fiscal issues. Indeed, friends in the UK have tried to put my mind at ease by asserting that he\u2019s simply throwing around money to facilitate Brexit.\n\nGiven the importance of that issue, even I\u2019m willing to forgive a bit of profligacy if that\u2019s the price of escaping the European Union.\n\nBut, if that\u2019s the case, Johnson needs to get serious as soon as Brexit is delivered.\n\nLet\u2019s close by looking at recent fiscal history in the UK. Here\u2019s a chart, based on numbers from the IMF, showing the burden of spending relative to economic output.\n\nMargaret Thatcher did a good job, unsurprisingly.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a shock to see that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown frittered away that progress.\n\nBut what is surprising is to see how David Cameron was very prudent.\n\nIndeed, if you compared spending growth during the Blair-Brown era with spending growth in the Cameron-May era, you can see a huge difference.", "description": "I\u2019m glad that Boris Johnson is Prime Minister for\u00a0the simple .10/11/2019 15:40:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
