Jesus is King marks a move to curse-word-free, God-focused music for the rap superstar, who has spoken frequently this year about embracing religion.\n\nThe 26-minute record departs from the shock-value lyrics of West\u2019s last solo record, Ye (which included the chillingly titled I Thought About Killing You). However, West does provide listeners with an intimate portrait of his changed values, the legacy he hopes to leave his kids, and his continuing struggle with mental illness. The rapper also brings gospel music into exciting new territory \u2013 deftly mixing electronic, hip-hop, and choral sounds.\n\nThe album comes at an interesting time for West. He continues to test his fans\u2019 (more specifically, his black fans\u2019) allegiance with his enthusiastic support of Donald Trump and his Maga followers. He has also claimed slavery was \u201ca choice\u201d and boasted that the Republican party ended slavery, without providing the necessary historical context.\n\nFor many, Jesus is King is a chance to find out where West\u2019s values really lie.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we learned:\n\nHe loves Chick-fil-A\n\nWest provides a passionate, catchy-as-hell ode to the fast food chain Chick-fil-A in his song Closed on Sunday. \u201cClosed on Sunday/ You my Chick-Fil-A,\u201d he raps in the chorus. Then he says: \u201cYou\u2019re my number one, with the lemonade.\u201d\n\nAs anyone who has craved a chicken sandwich on Sunday knows, the fast-food chain is closed on \u201cthe day of rest\u201d, in keeping with the Christian faith. Here, West uses the metaphor as a way of addressing his and his family\u2019s much-needed breaks from the spotlight.\n\n\n\nThe reference might also be a giant troll from West. Like the rapper, Chick-fil-A has attracted its fair share of controversy and criticism. The company has faced widespread criticism over its ties to anti-LGBT Christian groups. Despite all the bad press, Chick-fil-A continues to be successful \u2013 it was recently ranked as a top brand among Gen-Zers. Perhaps West is pointing out how he also remains insanely popular despite all his blunders.\n\nHe\u2019s well aware Yeezy is expensive\n\nSince its inception in 2015, fans have complained about the high costs of West\u2019s hyped fashion brand Yeezy. Not everyone has $300 to spend on Yeezy Boosts, his popular line of footwear.\n\nWest has expressed the desire to makes Yeezy Boosts more affordable and accessible \u2013 but that day has yet to come.\n\nWest defends the high cost of Yeezys by placing the blame on the IRS. \u201cThe IRS want they fifty plus our tithe / Man, that\u2019s over half of the pie,\u201d he raps. \u201cThat\u2019s why I charge the prices that I charge/ I can\u2019t be out here dancin\u2019 with the stars.\u201d (Which is some seriously stealth shade to over 321 celebrities, including West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West.)\n\nHe regrets career decisions\n\nKanye spends a significant portion of the album talking about temptation and the devil.\n\n\u201cTold the devil that I\u2019m going on a strike \u2026 I\u2019ve been working for you my whole life,\u201d he raps in the song Hands On. He also says in the song On God: \u201cThe devil had my soul, I can\u2019t lie \u2026 I bleached my hair for every time I could\u2019ve died.\u201d\n\nThe lyrics suggest the rapper regrets the secular music he\u2019s built his fame on. In fact, West\u2019s personal pastor recently revealed he had to convince the rapper not to quit rap music and that the star called the genre \u201cdevil\u2019s music\u201d.\n\nThis disavowal of secular music gives fans some insight into why the much-hyped Yandhi was never released. As West raps: \u201cEverybody wanted Yandhi, then Jesus did the laundry.\u201d\n\nHe still wants to repeal the 13th amendment, apparently\n\nWest references the 13th amendment \u2013 which abolishes slavery, but leaves a provision for imprisonment \u2013 in two songs on Jesus Is King. First, he touches on the mass incarnation of black men in Hands Up, rapping: \u201cAnd all my brothers locked up on the yard / You can still be anything you wanna be / Went from one in four to one in three / 13th amendment, gotta end it, that\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nThen in On God, West raps: \u201cWonder if they\u2019re gonna read your rights / 13th amendment, three strikes / Made a left when I should\u2019ve made a right.\u201d\n\nWest previously drew criticism in 2018 when he first voiced his disapproval of the 13th amendment and his desire to see America repeal it. \u201cThe 13th amendment is slavery in disguise, meaning it never ended. We are the solution that heals,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHe says God helped him break his porn addiction\n\nThis tidbit comes from the slew of candid interviews West is doing around the album. He revealed to the DJ Zane Lowe that finding one of his father\u2019s Playboy copies was a \u201cgateway to a full-on pornography addiction\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt has impacted every choice I have made in my life from age five to now, having to kick the habit.\u201d", "description": "On Jesus Is King, the artist considers religion, the 13th amendment, and his pricey clothing line", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3ceb9bb65cb7746241e44fe9eaa0a1a0955e964/0_46_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa25b56ab3a3627006fb48c7000e4713", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
