I've saved thousands of pounds over the years by shopping like this.\n\n\"I've always been into re-using and recycling - and now 90% of my wardrobe is second-hand. When it comes to clothes it's become more of a hobby rather than a necessity.\n\n\"It's not that I can't afford to go somewhere else for clothes, it's just that I get the fun and excitement out of finding something that's a lot cheaper.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I can get an outfit that looks just as good for a fiver rather than paying \u00a350, why wouldn't anybody want to do that?\n\n\"It's not only saving people money going to charity shops but it's also helping charity and the environment by keeping clothes out of landfill - it's a win-win-win situation.\"\n\nOne of Nina's greatest successes came when she visited a charity shop which was closing down and put on a deal for customers to fill a bag for \u00a31.\n\nShe picked up a dress and had nine other items in the bag, pricing each at just 10p.\n\nThe dress was perfect for a black tie charity boxing event Nina attended, where she says she got plenty of compliments on her outfit.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nHaving been embarrassed at the prospect of wearing second-clothes when she was younger, becoming a teenage mum changed Nina's outlook.\n\n\"I had my daughter when I was 16,\" she said. \"Having a home and baby was very expensive.\n\n\"My mum introduced me to charity shops when I was a teenager, she used to always get me things from there but I was always embarrassed by it.\n\n\"I would hide by standing a bit further down the road in case anyone I knew saw me but when I had my daughter I needed to do things as cheaply as possible so it started from then.\n\n\"I had some friends who would say 'I'd never shop in a charity shop' or 'I'd never put my kids in secondhand clothes'.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"Comments like that fired me up to promote them as I feel so passionate about it.\n\n\"There's a stigma towards charity shops but once you've brought an item of clothing home and washed it, it's brand new.\n\n\"Some still have the tags on them, so they've never been worn.\"\n\nNina now shares her buys from charity shops, car boots and discount chain Steals to show off the stylish looks she creates.\n\nShe explains she wants to look different and stand out, something she struggles to do from shopping on the high street.\n\n\"I remember buying a coat a couple of years ago and wore it on the school run and everyone was wearing it.\n\n\"With charity shops you don't have to worry about someone wearing the same outfit as you.\n\n\"My boyfriend Jacob didn't listen to me at first and I had to argue my case but now he's more open to it.\n\n\"A few weeks ago we went for a night out and he needed something to wear. I said 'leave it to me, I'll come back with a shirt for you', which I did. He's a convert now.\n\n\"Every six months I go through my wardrobe and if I haven't worn something for a while I'll donate it back to the charity shop.\"", "description": "Thrifty mum Nina picks up brands including Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss for her family for under a fiver", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664894.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
