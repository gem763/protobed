(Image: Disney)\n\nWe live in the age of the hot take, but I feel like this shouldn\u2019t be one, right?\n\nThe Simpsons\u2019 annual tradition of anthology spooktaculars is one of the venerable show\u2019s most venerable of institutions. The freedom they provide\u2014within the realm of horror at least\u2014often leads to the series\u2019 best homages, the finest parodies, and the greatest gags.\n\nFreed from the constraint of having to make even the faintest sense in the already absurd lives lived on Evergreen Terrace, their endless riffs don\u2019t quite feel like they\u2019re the gasps of a show still trying to retain relevance long after many fans would decry is a series well past its peak. They\u2019re just good, silly, often comically violent bits of fun. But while Treehouse of Horror has endured even as The Simpsons has grown over the last three decades\u2014for better or worse, or however you feel about it\u2014it\u2019s kind of amazing to think that the show has still not quite managed to nail a singular Treehouse as unequivocally and brilliantly as its fourth time at spook-bat in 1993 with Treehouse of Horror IV.\n\nThey\u2019re dogs. And they\u2019re playing POKER. (Image: Disney)\n\nI mean, come on. The Twilight Zone homage in Terror at 5\u00bd Feet! Flanders as the devil in The Devil and Homer Simpson! These aren\u2019t just some of the most iconic moments in Treehouse history, they\u2019re some of the most iconic moments in The Simpsons, full stop.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Bart Simpson\u2019s Dracula. The best sketch in what is the best Treehouse of Horror.\n\nIf you have somehow not seen it\u2014frankly, what is wrong with you, why are you even reading this article, and good news I guess, it\u2019ll be on Disney+ in a few weeks\u2014Bart Simpson\u2019s Dracula is, well, The Simpsons. Doing Dracula. The vampire in this case of course (or vampyr, as Lisa dramatically intones in its opening moments, a read so iconic it as burned into my mind as the only, unequivocal way to say \u201cvampyr\u201d whenever that rare situation arises) is none other than Mr. Burns. Because who else could be a literal bloodsucker than the domineering capitalist specter that haunts Springfield and Homer in equal measure?\n\nStraight outta the Gary Oldman wardrobe. (Image: Disney)\n\nOne convenient invite to Burns\u2019 not-at-all-suspicious castle later, the Simpson family finds itself going on zany escapes as Lisa tries to prove to her blissfully ignorant parents and brother that Burns is the one behind the vampire attacks hitting Springfield as of late. Those attacks? Clearly the work of a mummy. The castle? Oh, it\u2019s just what being a billionaire gets you. His straight out of Francis Ford Coppola look? He\u2019s an old man, what you gonna do. That said castle\u2019s underlevels lead to a crypt filled with vampires? Weird flex, but we all gotta get some sleep somehow. His biography is called Yes, I Am a Vampire? Details, schmetails!\n\nIt\u2019s that sort of absurd silliness\u2014and everyone but Lisa being willing enough to say \u201ceh\u201d and go along with it, and even then, she does too, eventually\u2014that makes Bart Simpson\u2019s Dracula shine brighter than Vampire-Burns\u2019 pointiest fangs. Beyond its sharp pop culture parody, its ironic detachment from reality just makes for great gag after great gag (\u201cOhh\u2026I guess killing will be fun enough,\u201d Homer laments, when Lisa chides him for wanting to use the slide into Burns\u2019 crypt, will never not crack me up). It combines everything you want out of a good Treehouse sketch: solid source material to riff off of, funny jokes, and a really smart use of The Simpsons\u2019 world traced onto an unexpected genre.\n\nAlso a good gag? The super fun happy slide. (Image: Disney)\n\nBut while my childhood self loved the silliness of the \u2018Dracula\u2019 part of Bart Simpson\u2019s Dracula, as I\u2019ve grown older (and only increasingly sillier), it\u2019s the Bart Simpson\u2019s bit of that title that I have come to appreciate more and more. Because it\u2019s important to remember that, beyond it being a nod to Coppola\u2019s evocation of the author\u2019s name for his 1992 classic, it is also there to remind us that everything we watch unfold in this story is through Bart\u2019s lens. And remembering that makes Bart Simpson\u2019s Dracula evolve from funny pastiche to something that is both really smart and, in some ways, kind of touching.\n\nThe inherent absurdity of the sketch\u2014dancing from gag to oddball reference to more gags as everyone involved just kind of shrugs and rolls with it\u2014smacks so perfectly of the creation of a juvenile slacker like Bart, especially given that, as the framing device explains before going in, he was meant to do a bit based on Coolidge\u2019s A Friend in Need but changed it at the last minute.\n\nI have been dying to read Steve Allen\u2019s foreword to this for years. (Image: Disney)\n\nHaving the hook that his parents are all secretly the real vampires (especially Marge as the head vampire, in the truest acknowledgement of who rules the roost in the Simpsons family) is evocative of his distaste for the authority figures in his life. Hell, even the zany climax of the sketch breaking suddenly into a Charlie Brown Christmas parody reads like a snotty biting-of-his-thumb (or eating of his shorts) in the direction of it all. Of course Bart is told to tell a Halloween skit and ends it as a Christmas one. You don\u2019t tell Bart Simpson what to do!\n\nBut above all, what makes Bart Simpson\u2019s Dracula truly Bart\u2019s lens is that, well, Bart really isn\u2019t the lens at all. Within the story itself, at least.\n\nLisa is.\n\nMarge and her minions corner Lisa. (Image: Disney)\n\nAnd as ceaselessly, nightmarishly assholish as he can be to his little sister as he can be, and as much as he would deign to admit it publicly, deep down he loves her more than anything else in the world. So of course in his Dracula lampoon he isn\u2019t the hero. He\u2019s the dumb comic relief who, as Lisa investigates the oblique mystery of Mr. Burns, gets himself done in just so he can ride a silly slide right back down into the vampire pit he and his sister just escaped. Lisa is the hero, figuring it all out, denying the temptation\u2014teasing temptation from her brother, no less, because that\u2019s their entire relationship\u2014of being converted into a vampire, hatching the plan to beat Burns. She\u2019s put in danger, but always finds a way out, even right at the very end.\n\nOf course, when tasked with coming up with something at the last minute, Bart Simpson turns to inspiration from the one person he can always count on.\n\nGod bless us, every one.
