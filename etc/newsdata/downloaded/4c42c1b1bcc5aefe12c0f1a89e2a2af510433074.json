The only item on the menu that does not change with the season or the day of the week, it is a lamb patty served on a bun with fennel, aioli and an unusual optional upgrade: a row of marinated anchovies.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of people who are like, \u2018Really? Is it really good?\u2019\u201d Mr. Perkins said. \u201cAnd we always say, \u2018We\u2019ll buy your burger if you don\u2019t like it.\u2019 But it just never happens.
