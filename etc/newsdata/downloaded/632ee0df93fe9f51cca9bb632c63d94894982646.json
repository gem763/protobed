Texas is number one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re with me that a secure border is actually a humanitarian thing because it does keep kids safer?\u201d Marlow asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. One hundred percent,\u201d Travers responded.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nHuman trafficking \u2014 including child sex-trafficking \u2014 is a criminal enterprise dominated by transnational drug cartels, Travers said. He recalled his organization\u2019s role in assisting the recovery of a 14-year-old American girl in Mexico who had been abducted by a Mexican gang member and smuggled across the southern border.\n\n\u201cA 29-year-old gang member affiliated with the Mexican mafia got ahold of [the 14-year-old American girl] and her social networking through one of her friends and saw that the young girl was posting [about] her problems,\u201d Travers said. \u201c[He] befriended her, unbeknownst to [her] mom, and this person lured her. [He] told her, \u2018You need to come with me. I\u2019ll take care of you,\u2019 and [made] all these promises \u2026 and [spoke of] how much affection he had for her. So one day the mom went to go take the 14-year-old to school, the window was open, and she was gone. He had plied her up with drugs and taken her down to Mexico, and we had to find her in Mexico and coordinate her rescue, and now he\u2019s in jail.\u201d\n\nTravers linked his professional background as a Los Angeles police officer to his decision to found Saved in America.\n\n\u201cMy background is obviously police investigation and private investigation,\u201d Travers said. \u201cThe motivation for us to do this is, as the founder, I was listening to [the story of a] young girl named Brittanee Drexel from upstate New York that went missing, and I was wondering, \u2018What happened?\u2019 and I knew from working narcotics in Los Angeles that there formed what we\u2019ll call an evil triad of street gang members, prison gang members, and the cartel that took over the narcotics-trafficking trade in this country.\u201d\n\nAround 2009, \u201cthis same triad decided to take over child sex-trafficking,\u201d Travers explained. \u201cRight after that, I read an article about United States Navy SEALs overseas rescuing children. So I got a hold of these guys and I said, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t you come out here and we\u2019ll put cops together with special operators, and for free, we\u2019ll go help find these children?'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way kids are taken in this country, it\u2019s not like the movie Taken,\u201d Traver said. \u201cThese gang members and gang member recruiters lure young girls through social media networking away from their homes and ply them up with drugs, up to and including heroin. And that\u2019s how they traffic our children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coercion,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re coerced.\u201d He cited a study conducted in San Diego County which showed that \u201cthere\u2019s at least one gang member recruiter or trafficker in every middle school and high school\u201d in the county.\n\nChild predators often use social media to target vulnerable young girls from troubled backgrounds, Travers explained.\n\n\u201cThey look for a young girl who might be going through some type of trauma, like [parental] divorce, a death in the family, a break-up with a friend or something. Then \u2026 they befriend the child [via] social networking and social networking applications to have conversations with the child that the parent has no idea [are occurring], and then one day the parent goes to get the child to take them to school, and the child\u2019s gone. They\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\nForensic analysis of missing children\u2019s internet behavior is critical in determining the nature of their disappearances, Travers said. \u201cIt appears to the normal police officer is that it\u2019s a runaway, but in fact, the answer lies in the social networking of the child, that she was seduced outside of the family and that\u2019s how they traffic them.\u201d\n\nTravers highlighted the volume of missing children \u2014 including those being trafficked \u2014 across America.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem across the country,\u201d determined Travers. \u201cAccording to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, there [are] about 300,000 missing children in our country at any one time. Now, if you take another statistic that 30 to 40 percent of these 300,000 children are being trafficked \u2014 we\u2019re talking 100,000 children in our country [who] are being sex-trafficked, who are being enslaved by organized crime.\u201d\n\nSaved in America accepts donations.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "An open border endagers American children by assisting\u00a0Mexican drug cartels engaged in child sex-trafficking, explained Joseph Travers.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/wi/afp/18/3191f5_propublica-has-released-children-sobbing-wailing-separated-parents-southern-e1529603503946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
