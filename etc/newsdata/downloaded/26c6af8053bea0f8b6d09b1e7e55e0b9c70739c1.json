I can\u2019t explain the feeling, it just feels very big,\u201d Walters told reporters on Friday.\n\nAs for a gameplan, he said his focus is on sticking to the instructions of coach Phil Davies.\n\n\u201cStick to the basics... do everything that we have been training on in the last few months. And don\u2019t try anything stupid!\u201d\n\nThere is a chance that the enthusiasm of the Namibians may get the better of them and in a World Cup where overzealous, and high tackles are already a major talking point, Walters says the players are well-aware of the consequences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on our minds (about high tackles), you know you can get cited. The low cut is the best tackle you can get, so we must just stick with that,\u201d he said.\n\nWalters, 26, is one of many players in the Namibia squad who have been exposed to South African rugby through their schooling and studies.\n\nBorn in the tiny southern Namibian town of Keetmanshoop, he was schooled across the border in Upington in South Africa\u2019s Northern Cape.\n\nHe was part of the academy of the Johannesburg-based Golden Lions, but never managed to break into the professional scene in the country.\n\nThat failure makes Saturday\u2019s clash all the more significant for Walters, giving him a chance to prove his ability, and perhaps put himself in the shop window for professional South African and European clubs.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the news (of a World Cup call-up) I was having a braai (barbecue) with my cousin and just chilling. Coming from where I come from, it was a very, very big thing for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be no love lost on Saturday because it is against our neighbours, but we also represent Africa together.\n\n\u201cI just think it will be a great clash, a great atmosphere and a big opportunity for us (as players).\u201d", "description": "Namibia centre PJ Walters admitted his nerves are sky-high ahead of Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup Pool B meeting with heavyweights South Africa and says his main aim is not to \"try anything stupid\".", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434493740&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0OL-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
