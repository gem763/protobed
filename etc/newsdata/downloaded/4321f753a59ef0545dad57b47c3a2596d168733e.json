He was 89 years old and still teaching, writing and thinking, thinking, thinking all the time.\n\nOne of my teachers in graduate school in the 1980s told me once what it was like to be in a seminar with Bloom. \u201cHe would do things like read a line from Shelley,\u201d she told me, \u201cthen ask us, \u2018What line from Milton is Shelley revising here?\u2019 None of us knew, of course, so Bloom proceeded to recite the line from \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019 \u2014 and then voice the next 40+ lines from memory.\u201d\n\nHe was a radical theorist in his early career, spinning interpretations of Romantic and Modernist poetry out of a Freudian model of the tyranny of the father and the rebellion of the son (that is, poets inspired by a precursor poet, but having to deny that influence in order to come into their own). When Camille Paglia, then a PhD student at Yale, couldn\u2019t find a professor to direct her thesis on sexual deviance in ancient and modern art, she went to Bloom who immediately told her that he was the only faculty member in New Haven who could do so.\n\nHe was one of the four professors at Yale profiled by The New York Times Magazine, the author calling him \u201cthe most original literary critic in America\u201d (\u201cThe Tyranny of the Yale Critics,\u201d Feb. 9, 1986). Someone said that Bloom\u2019s motto was, \u201cThe more people say that I am wrong, the more I am sure that I am right\u201d\u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, but the adversarial temper fits. In the 1970s at Yale, Paul de Man formed a veritable sect of junior deconstructionists around him, but Bloom refused to join because he regarded deconstruction as a species of nihilism. De Man, in turn, regarded Bloom as his most brilliant colleague.\n\nWhen, however, over the course of the 1980s a younger generation of professors aligned the humanities with identity politics (\u201cNo more Dead White Males!\u201d), he couldn\u2019t stand it. He called them the School of Resentment, a judgment derived from Nietzsche that attributed the values of the race-class-gender critics to the envy and anger of the mediocre when in the presence of greatness. They had replaced Emerson on the syllabus with a second-rate feminist novelist, he implied, because they couldn\u2019t stand the fact of unequal talents in the world.\n\nBy the time Bloom wrote \u201cThe Western Canon\u201d in 1994, he was the leading voice for Western Civilization in America (the other Bloom, Allan, had died in 1992). The professors considered him a dinosaur, but they dare not face off with him in debate. His erudition would show, and so would their thin learning. Besides, Bloom didn\u2019t waste time waging battle with his woke colleagues. Why bother? They never say anything interesting or original \u2014 Shakespeare and the Book of Job do all the time.\n\nThe range of reference was extraordinary. He once wrote: \u201cHamlet, Kierkegaard, and Kafka are all ironists in the wake of Jesus.\u201d The only way to carry a declaration like that off under questioning is to have spent many, many years reading books and absorbing them as if they pointed out your fate. He wasn\u2019t a Christian (he called himself a \u201cGnostic\u201d), but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the Gospels. In an interview with Charlie Rose from the early 2000s, he said, \u201cThe Jesus of the Gospel of Mark is a man who is always in a hurry. He is moving through crowds, he cannot pause, he is driven, he does not know who he is, he is perpetually asking his disciples, \u2018But who do people say I am?\u2019\u201d Most of all, Bloom says, Jesus is \u201cuncertain\u201d of his relationship to God, and that makes him strikingly fascinating. To a Catholic like me, that makes Bloom a heretic, but I could listen to him go on and on.\n\nEveryone knows what has happened to the humanities, but the biased politics of the professors often obscures a worse condition: They aren\u2019t all that well-read. They\u2019ve got the identity talk down pat, but ask them about Gulliver in Laputa or \u201cBecause I could not stop for Death\u201d and they stumble like sophomores (unless those works happen to be in their narrow specialization). The professor who ranges smoothly across the English canon from Chaucer to Joyce is increasingly rare, the academic who lives it as deeply as Bloom did even more so. He was one of the last of the American humanists. The literary sublime was active in him; it exhilarated and tasked him; he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. With Bloom at the podium, you felt that English was a meaningful, momentous course of study, not the tiresome PC endeavor it has become.\n\nThere was always something mournful in Bloom\u2019s demeanor. We have good reason to emulate him this week.\n\n\u2022 Mark Bauerlein teaches English at Emory University.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
