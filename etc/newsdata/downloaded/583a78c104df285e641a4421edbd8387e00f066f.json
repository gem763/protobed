When we're dehydrated our skin lacks hydration which can lead to dullness, dryness and loss of plumpness in skin'.\n\n'Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it increase production and excretion of urine.\n\n'As our body will priories vital organs such as the brain or liver \u2013 connective tissue such as collagen (which keeps skin youthful) is one of the first things to stop receiving hydration which can lead the formation of wrinkles.'\n\nAlcohol effects sleep\n\nEver woken up after a few too many glasses of wine and wondered why you're so tired still and you have bags under your eyes?\n\n'Alcohol is really effective at disrupting sleep patterns. It suppresses the body\u2019s production of melatonin which is an essential for good quality sleep. Research has shown that a moderate dose of alcohol reduced melatonin production by almost 20 per cent,' says Katie.\n\n'When we sleep our skin rebuilds collagen and repairs damage from UV exposure, reducing wrinkles and age spots. Poor sleep means less opportunity to repair.'\n\nSugary cocktails\n\n'Many alcoholic beverages have a high sugar content which increases blood sugar levels,' says the skin therapist.\n\n'Sugar molecules attach to collagen and elastin proteins in the skin through a process called glycation. This process produces advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs).\n\n'AGEs damage the skin in the form of fine lines, wrinkles, loss of elasticity and sallowness. It can also interfere with the production of new collagen and elastin which we need to keep the dermal matrix strong and tight.'\n\nKatie White (pictured) from Hackney in London, who has just launched her own skin studio, called re:lax in East London, reveals that when you drink alcohol your skin gets dehydrated - effecting the production of natural collagen\n\nHow to limit or reverse the damage\n\nKatie says that the poison is in the dose: 'Enjoy in moderation, think of it as a treat to enjoy now and again rather than a side dish to your evening meal.\n\n'Have a glass of water after every drink to help support your body and skin. It will help you avoid a headache the next day as well.\n\n'If you have had a particularly social period, I would recommend introducing a little bit of liver support. Bitter foods such as chicory, rocket, watercress and endive are great, as are nettle, dandelion and burdock teas or tinctures.'\n\nKatie's golden Rules of Gua Sha 1. Cleanse skin first 2. Always use a massage medium such as oil \u2013 don\u2019t gua sha on dry skin 3. Work from the neck upwards and pull the tool across your skin, don\u2019t push it 4. Hold the tool flat and don\u2019t work over breakouts, broken skin, sunburn or inflammation 5. Be gentle \u2013 it should never hurt A Gua sha tool took can be glided across the skin to redirect energy flow At home instructions: 1. Starting from the neck \u2013 stroke upwards to increase blood flow to face and downwards to encourage lymphatic drainage 2. Place gua sha beneath chin, stroke along jawline towards ear 3. Hook the curve into jawline and move from chin to ear 4. Place short edge at the front and centre of chin, below mouth and move from centre to ear 5. Repeat move from corner of mouth to ear, under cheek bone \u2013 acupressure can be used under the cheek bone to release, lift and sculpt 6. Hold and lift nasolabial line, rub with serrated edge to plump out line 7. Place gua sha to the side of nose and move gently towards side of face \u2013 light pressure here 8. Pumping action around eye 9. Strokes up and along to release tension from eyebrows 10. Pull gua sha upwards to lift forehead and brow, continue work into the hairline, use friction across lines to plump up skin 11. To finish, do downward strokes from behind the ear to the collar bone to promote drainage of any dermal waste that has been released from the facial massage\n\nSOS for the skin\n\nKatie also recommends facials which include LED light therapy and cosmetic acupuncture - as they are effective at stimulating collagen production (which naturally slows down as we age) and is a great ways to maintain plump, tight, and youthful looking skin.\n\nThe skin therapist is also a big advocate of Gua sha - an ancient self-care practice used in traditional Chinese medicine in which a tool, usually made from jade, bone or horn is glided across the skin to redirect energy flow.\n\n'Studies have shown that just one minute per day of gua sha improves microcirculation by up to 400 per cent \u2013 this results in boosted collagen production, reduces wrinkles, it rejuvenates, tones and smooths skin.\n\n'It can also combat pigmentation, dark circles and puffy eyes and define jaw lines and cheek bones,' reveals Katie.", "description": "Katie White, from Hackney in London, who has just launched her own skin studio, called re:lax reveals that alcohol is a 'key offender' into why your face could start to see signs of ageing.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19386212-0-image-a-7_1570437761590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
