Foreign reserves have nonetheless tumbled by more than $20bn since. They now stand at $43.5bn.\n\nArgentina\u2019s bonds are trading in deeply distressed territory, at about 40 cents on the dollar, and the government has said it wants to extend maturities both with private creditors and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThat task will likely fall to the incoming government though Fernandez has yet to lay out an economic plan or name his cabinet.", "description": "People can now withdraw a maximum of $200 a month in measure to stem outflow of foreign exchange reserves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/2/9d17b9dd847744de929d878c25c729b7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
