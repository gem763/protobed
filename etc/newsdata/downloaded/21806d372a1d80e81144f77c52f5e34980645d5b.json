But US Congress remains deeply concerned about the withdrawal of US troops from the region and Turkey's military offensive.", "description": "US House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill aimed at slapping sanctions on Turkey over its military offensive in northern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db9354ca310cf3e97a38ed6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
