NBA sophomore class full of rising stars", "language": "en", "text": "Deandre Ayton strolled around the practice court, talking and laughing with coaches and teammates following a two-hour workout with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIt is clear he is comfortable operating in lofty surroundings, even on a morning in the mountains of Flagstaff, despite a sign on the wall that warned of the dangers of physical exertion at 7,000 feet of altitude.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, 7,000? Nah, I need more like 15. That was pretty light,\u201d Ayton quipped. \u201cI don\u2019t have that little chest burn feeling when you\u2019re at such a high altitude. It was fun.\u201d\n\nSo is winning. And the expectations are high for the former No. 1 draft pick, who is part of a promising 2018 NBA draft class that teams are looking at becoming the faces of rebuilding franchises.\n\nDallas guard Luka Doncic was the rookie of the year after averaging 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and six assists per game. Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young finished second in the voting, averaging 19.1 points and 8.1 assists. Ayton was third.\n\n\u201cThis summer, I\u2019ve never worked so hard in a gym before in my life,\u201d said the 21-year-old Ayton, who averaged 16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds. \u201cI\u2019ve seen these lines so many times, I see them in regular life now. They beat me to the ground this summer.\u201d\n\nFirst-year Suns coach Monty Williams said Ayton\u2019s development isn\u2019t as much about his physical skills because those have been evident all along. He said the guys who develop into great players are the ones who recognize the sweat equity involved.\n\n\u201cThey realize early in their first year that it takes a lot of work to be good, so their work ethic goes up that summer,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou see more consistent work from guys and a different mentality in the weight room. They take coaching a lot better because they know more stuff.\u201d\n\nA look at some of the top second-year players in the NBA:\n\nDONCIC, DALLAS MAVERICKS\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Doncic wowed the NBA with his combination of shooting, passing and knack for producing in clutch moments. And he\u2019s just 20 years old.\n\nMavericks coach Rick Carlisle expects improvement from Doncic in year two, but it might look a little different than others are expecting.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing with more players and more better players,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s playing with another star-caliber player with (Kristaps) Porzingis. The dynamics of the stats are going to be way different. I don\u2019t know what the whole thing\u2019s going to look like.\u201d\n\nYOUNG, ATLANTA HAWKS\n\nThe 6-2 guard got off to a slow start as a rookie, which led to plenty of talk that the draft day Doncic-for-Young swap was going to end up heavily in favor of the Mavericks.\n\nBut Young bounced back with an encouraging second half. He averaged more than 23 points and nine assists over his final 31 games.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to be even tougher this year, but that\u2019s something you work on during the summer and something I knew I needed to be even more prepared for,\u201d Young said.\n\nMARVIN BAGLEY III, SACRAMENTO KINGS\n\nThe 6-11 Bagley was much like Young in that he pushed through an up-and-down first half of the season before finishing with an impressive second half.\n\nThe No. 2 pick averaged about 18 points and nine rebounds over the season\u2019s final two months despite coming off the bench in most games. He made the All-Rookie team along with Doncic, Ayton, Young and Memphis\u2019 Jaren Jackson.\n\nThe Kings showed some promise last season with a young core that includes Bagley and De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield.\n\n\u201cNot making the playoffs was something I thought about all summer,\u201d Bagley said. \u201cI just had that in the back of my mind that we still gotta get to the playoffs and show everybody what we can do.\u201d\n\nJAREN JACKSON JR., MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES\n\nLast year\u2019s No. 4 pick showed plenty of potential, averaging 13.8 points and 4.7 rebounds over 58 games despite missing time with a quadriceps injury. The 6-11 forward just turned 20 years old.\n\nHe\u2019ll team with this year\u2019s No. 2 overall pick, Ja Morant, on a remade Memphis roster.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be predictable, you\u2019ve got to grow and find other ways to get to the basket,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI know a lot of the ways I scored before aren\u2019t always going to work just because people get better and scout better.\u201d\n\nCOLLIN SEXTON, CLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nSexton was a bright spot on a bad Cavaliers team. The 6-2 guard, the No. 8 pick, averaged 16.7 points and three assists per game.\n\nHe said he spent the offseason watching hours of film and getting stronger in the weight room.\n\n\u201cI felt like I needed to be stronger to finish at the rim a lot better,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cAnd I want to be able to fight over screens, instead of getting hit on them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Josh Dubow, George Henry, Teresa Walker and Schuyler Dixon and AP freelancer Brian Dulik contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Deandre Ayton strolled around the practice court, talking and laughing with coaches and teammates following a two-hour workout with the Phoenix Suns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/bucks_mavericks_basketball_70043_c0-144-3456-2160_s1200x700.jpg?90f860a916216306659c2cf52625b9dc32e4803c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
