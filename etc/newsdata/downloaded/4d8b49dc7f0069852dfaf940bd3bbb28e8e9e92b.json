Boil \u2019em, mash \u2019em, stick \u2019em in a stew,\u201d says the lovable Samwise Gamgee in \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong: Potatoes do well in all those cases, as one of the most versatile, hard-stock veggies of them all. Creamy. Fluffy. Wholesome. Hearty.\n\nBut crispy \u2014 this is the true magic of potatoes. Sam touches on this briefly when mentioning \u201clovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish,\u201d but we could write odes and sonnets praising the potato\u2019s propensity for a crisp bite. It\u2019s not crunch, per se \u2014 though that is good, too. No, we want the crispiness of potatoes touched with oil, a lacy, dissolving bite against a steaming, contrasting interior.\n\nWe know you could easily pick up a bag of freezer potatoes for some crispy bits, but we want you to have that experience from your own hand. Here are some recipes to get you started on a magical, crispy journey.\n\nGarlic-Roasted Potatoes, above. Sure, you know how to roast a potato. We believe you. Somehow, these easy roasted red potatoes had us reaching for just one more bite. Roasting whole cloves in the pan stops burned garlic crisps from imparting an acrid flavor and gives you the option of smooshing down a clove onto the potato for a mellow, garlicky bite.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nOven-Baked Potato Latkes. Could we really talk about crispy potatoes without bringing up latkes? This lightened-up version of the fried holiday favorite takes them to the oven and leaves the potato skin on. You\u2019ll get all the crispy, crunchy goodness without the effort of frying.\n\n\n\n(Renee Comet for The Washington Post)\n\nSweet Potato Crunch Gratins. Before someone snarks about sweet potatoes being yams \u2014 you\u2019re wrong. Now, down to business: Layering up matchsticks of sweet potato and parsnip with lime and black bean is a fun twist on a gratin that takes it from a side to a main meal.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nPotato Skin-Bacon Fat Chips. There are plenty of ways to stuff a potato skin, so we\u2019re not going to do that. Instead, we\u2019re going to make long, thick strips of potato skin and get them crunchy in the oven with salty, smoky bacon fat. Use these alongside dips instead of regular potato chips.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nCrushed Potatoes With Horseradish Cream. When you\u2019ve got little spuds with not quite enough surface area to get as much crunch as you want, steaming and then smashing them gives you more ridges and bumps to get browned up for a bite. Spicy horseradish cream is optional, but it is so, so good with these \u2014 we highly recommend using it.\n\n\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick/The Washington Post)\n\nSumac Sweet Potato Fries. Though I personally don\u2019t really like sweet potatoes, I still prefer sweet potato fries to regular ones. These get a textural boost from a coating of dried polenta or cornmeal, and a dusting of fruity, tangy sumac.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nDorie Greenspan\u2019s Potato Rosettes. When Dorie Greenspan says you\u2019ve got to make delicate petal crisps of potato, you do it. And you love it.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nOne-Skillet Sausage and Potato Hash. Get your weekend started in just one pan! While potatoes crisp up, slice sausage and add midway during cooking. Complete this warming breakfast with a cup of coffee.\n\n\n\n(Dixie D. Vereen for The Washington Post)\n\nRosti With Mushrooms. Think latke but the Swiss version: crispy edges and exterior, but with a fluffy interior to soak up savory mushrooms.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nMerriam-Webster toasts an expanding food and drink vocabulary with a \u2018tallboy\u2019 and \u2018matcha\u2019\n\nWe\u2019d eat these garlicky, spiced meatballs and chickpeas on anything\n\n10 plant-based soup recipes to warm your body and soul", "description": "This spud's for you.", "authors": ["Kari Sonde", "Editorial Aide For Food", "September At Pm", "Kari Sonde Is The Editorial Aide For The Food Section", "Where She Helps With Recipes", "Cooking Questions", "Food Styling.
