In a prerecorded interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Live, Kanye West announced that he\u2019s releasing a second album this year, Jesus Is Born. Jesus Is Born will be born on Christmas Day, which is so on the nose it almost cycles back to funny. It\u2019s unclear if the album will be another gospel album, Christmas-themed, or just a loop of Kanye West doing both parts of \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside.\u201d\n\nHis first gospel album, Jesus Is King, is allegedly arriving on October 25, after a month of delays. The original release date was pushed back to meet the release date for his upcoming documentary, also titled Jesus Is King. The movie chronicles his housing project and Sunday Services. At a preview of the doc and album in Chicago, Kanye told the audience that he was only making gospel music from now on. With Jesus Is Born, he may be living up to that promise.", "description": "Kanye West announced another album, \u2018Jesus Is Born,\u2019 while on Beats 1 Live with Zane Lowe.
