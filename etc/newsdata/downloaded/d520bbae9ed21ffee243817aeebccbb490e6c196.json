Essebsi had previously confirmed that he was not planning to run for re-election.\n\nParliament speaker Mohamed Ennaceur is currently acting as interim president.\n\nHow does the vote work?\n\nA candidate needs a majority of votes to win the election. If no-one gets a majority in the first round, the two candidates with most votes will face a second, decisive round.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Presidential candidates have held campaign events across the country\n\nThe winning candidate will be appointed to office for a five-year term.\n\nThe constitution states that Tunisia's president has control over defence, foreign policy and national security. The prime minister, chosen by parliament, is responsible for other portfolios.\n\nParliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in October.\n\nWhy is this election significant?\n\nThe country has won praise as the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings that began in Tunisia, before spreading across the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nIn what was hailed as a sign of its successful democratic transition, Tunisia this month held its first-ever televised debate of presidential candidates.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The campaign period featured the first ever televised debate of presidential candidates\n\nHowever, it has not all been smooth sailing. In recent years, the country has suffered attacks by Islamists and economic problems, with unemployment a persistent issue\n\nIn 2018, protesters across the country took to the streets to oppose the government's austerity measures.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed told Reuters news agency that economic opportunities must improve \"if Tunisia is to join the club of strong democracy\".\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nTunisia is the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nWidespread discontent at economic hardship, decades of autocratic rule and corruption erupted into mass demonstrations in December 2010 after a street vendor set himself on fire when officials confiscated his cart.\n\nThe unrest led to the ousting in 2011 of President Ben Ali, who had been in power for 23 years.\n\nThree years later, Tunisia's parliament approved a new constitution, which detailed how the new democracy would be run.\n\nThe text was hailed by the United Nations as a \"historic milestone\". Significant aspects included the recognition of equality between men and women, guaranteeing personal freedoms and splitting power between the president and prime minister.", "description": "It's seen as a test of one of the world's newest democracies, and two women are among those running.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1342A/production/_108809887_056493465-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
