committee\u2019s chairman to transport secretary Grant Shapps on including international aviation and shipping emissions in the UK\u2019s targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero overall by 2050.\n\nThe letter said aviation was likely to be the largest emitting sector in the UK by 2050, even with strong progress on technology to provide greener fuels and limiting demand for international flights.\n\nIncluding the emissions in the legally-binding net zero target emissions will show the scale of deployment needed for measures to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to offset the emissions caused by flying.\n\nAs far as shipping is concerned, the committee said net zero was likely to be feasible and cost-effective through use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen or ammonia.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to bring the UK\u2019s international aviation and shipping emissions formally within the UK\u2019s net-zero target,\u201d said CCC chief executive, Chris Stark. \u201cThese are real emissions, requiring a credible plan to manage them to net-zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cTheir inclusion in the UK target will complement international approaches and increase confidence that the Government is prioritising their reduction, ensuring the net-zero target covers all of the UK\u2019s emissions.\n\n\u201cAs the UK prepares to host the next major climate summit in 2020, we are well placed to show global leadership on this fundamental issue of international concern.\u201d\n\nLeo Murray, director at campaign group 10:10 climate action, said aviation had been given a \u201cfree ride\u201d in climate policy for too long, with politicians putting it in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d box.\n\nHe said the government was talking up electric planes, which should be an innovation priority, but the potential for technology to contribute to carbon cuts in a short time frame was limited.\n\n\u201cThe CCC make it very clear that growth in demand for flights from UK airports cannot continue unchecked. That\u2019s why we need to introduce a frequent flyer levy.\n\n\u201cMost of the environmental damage from air travel is caused not by annual family holidays but by very frequent leisure flights by those at top end of the income spectrum.\n\n\u201cA frequent flyer levy is the fairest and most effective way to keep aviation emissions within safe limits, at the same time as protecting access to some air travel for all,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said the government\u2019s current aviation strategy is incompatible with the net zero target, \u201cand must be revised\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe new strategy must focus on restricting demand growth, and will either require Heathrow\u2019s third runway being cancelled, or capacity restrictions on other airports to balance Heathrow\u2019s expansion.\u201d\n\nA Department for Transport spokeswoman said: \u201cThe fight against climate change is the greatest and most pressing challenge facing the modern world and this government recognises that aviation and shipping have a crucial role to play in tackling it.\n\n\u201cThe government has already made clear its commitment to zero emission shipping in the Clean Maritime Plan, which was published earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe are also committed to setting a clear ambition for the aviation sector and will carefully consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change when we publish our position on aviation and climate change for consultation shortly.\u201d\n\nPress Association", "description": "The growth in demand for flights must be curbed to tackle greenhouse gas emissions as part of the UK\u2019s climate targets, government advisers have said.
