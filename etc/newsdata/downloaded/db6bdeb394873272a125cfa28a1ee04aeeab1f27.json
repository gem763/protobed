Several times.\n\nOn at least three occasions during Facebook Inc.\u2019s FB, -0.56% earnings conference call Wednesday, he discussed antitrust scrutiny and the impact it could have on the social-networking giant, the subject of a Federal Trade Commission investigation.\n\nRead more: Facebook shares pop after revenue jumps 29%\n\nFacebook\u2019s chief executive and co-founder admitted the $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 is probably the focus of the FTC, but he considers the photo- and video-sharing service more \u201ccomplementary\u201d to what Facebook does than an attempt to silence a competitor.\n\n\u201cA lot of the antitrust questions out there will be about our acquisition of Instagram,\u201d Zuckerberg said in response to one analyst\u2019s question. \u201cBut we think [its business] was a lot more complementary than we thought... At the end of the day, it is the FTC\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg and Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner earlier acknowledged the impact of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which gives consumers the right to control their personal data. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen adoptions of people opting out [of Facebook],\u201d Wehner said. \u201cIt has been within the range of our expectations.\u201d\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act, a similar law that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2020, is \u201cstill a work in progress,\u201d Wehner said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how that develops.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg added that CCPA and the possibility of other states adopting variations of the same law highlight the need to pursue a \u201cvery set level\u201d of federal rules.\n\n\u201cWe face major regulatory and social issues,\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledged during the hour-long conference call, with implications on its costs and expenses \u2014 which jumped 32% to $10.5 billion during the recently-completed third quarter \u2014 and, ultimately, Facebook\u2019s bottom line.\n\nBut give Zuck credit for broaching what has so far been a taboo topic among his peers.\n\nHis forthrightness was in stark contrast to the post-earnings comments of the three other large tech companies facing antitrust probes. Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.01% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.98% had nothing to share, while Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +0.00% GOOG, -0.11% Google, lightly touched on the topic in vague terms.", "description": "While other big tech CEOs avoided the topic altogether, Zuckerberg answered questions about antitrust regulation during Facebook\u2019s Q3 earnings call.", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU354_zucker_ZG_20191030185741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
