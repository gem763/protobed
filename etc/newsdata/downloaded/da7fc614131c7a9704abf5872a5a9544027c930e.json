The men, Antione Dicenta, 51, and Graham Palmer, 34 \u2014 French and British nationals respectively \u2014 were allegedly trying to hide 40 bags containing more than a tonne of cocaine and ecstasy under seaweed. According to Australian media reports, the drugs\u2019 street value is estimated at AUD$1 billion.\n\nWhen police arrived on the island, Dicenta and Palmer tried to flee. But there was huge seal in their way, Damien Healy, a vice commander of the area\u2019s volunteer marine rescue service told ABC radio.\n\n\u201cThey woke it up and it jumped up with its big chest out and bellowed at them,\u201d he added. \u201cThe guys basically had the choice of going through the seal or getting arrested and they ended up choosing to get arrested.\u201d\n\nThe pair have since been charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. Three other men have also been charged for their involvement in the drugs operation. Australian police believe these men were nearby in another boat and \u201cwere ready to receive\u201d the haul from Dicenta and Palmer, Western Australia\u2019s police commissioner Chris Dawson explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve disrupted a big international drug syndicate here,\u201d Dawson said.", "description": "The seal just wanted to sleep in peace", "authors": ["Rachael Bunyan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M2s74qzLmunT47i8hn2wcA--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/1836b2170b74497e2dc9816ec80fe88b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
