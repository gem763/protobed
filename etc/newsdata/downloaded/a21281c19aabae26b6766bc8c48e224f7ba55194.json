One's pink, with daisies and smiling women on the packaging. One's not. If you had to guess, which one is more expensive?\n\nIf you guessed the flowery one, you're probably familiar with the concept of the \"pink tax.\" Basically, this refers to the idea that products marketed toward women are more expensive than comparable items marketed to men.

The company also ensured that products like deodorant and razors that are marketed to women match such products targeting men. That all comes out of the company's bottom line, but Huang said that it's a reflection of Boxed's values.\n\nAnd the savings have added up over time.\n\n\"We save our customers over $1 million to date,\" Huang said. \"It's truly core to who were are.\"", "description": "Boxed cofounder and CEO Chieh Huang spoke at Groceryshop in Las Vegas about his \"fight against the pink tax.\"", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d825d482e22af77b2591e98-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
