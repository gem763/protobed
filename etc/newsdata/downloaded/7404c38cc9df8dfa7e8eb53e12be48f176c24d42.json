And it\u2019s a real one, unlike the kind of things that Trump talks about,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told NowThis media outlet.\n\nFederal investigators previously considered whether Mrs. Clinton violated any laws by using a private email server while secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, but the FBI ultimately decided in 2016 against bringing any related charges.\n\nMore recently, The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Trump administration has contacted approximately 130 current and former State Department officials in recent weeks to tell them that emails they sent during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure have been retroactively classified and could constitute potential security violations.\n\n\u201cMy reaction, as you might predict, [was] absolute bewilderment and disappointment,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in the interview. \u201cThese people are experienced foreign service officers, other distinguished Americans who\u2019ve had great careers. What does it mean to retroactively classify something they sent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that they\u2019re doing it again, because now they\u2019re trying to bring in other people,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have repeatedly described the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nLed by Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, that probe resulted in criminal charges bring brought against 34 individuals and three companies, including several former members of Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign, prior to concluding earlier this year.\n\nMr. Trump has since asserted that the impeachment inquiry initiated by House Democrats last week over a whistleblower complaint involving a conversation with the Ukrainian president is another \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
