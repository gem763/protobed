It\u2019s very hard for all of us at NBC and the Today Show and it\u2019s very very, very difficult.\u2019\n\nSavannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer and Hoda Kotb hosted the Today Show together (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHoda, who replaced Lauer full time, added: \u2018I am looking at you and having a weird moment. We were sitting here like this two years ago and truth be told, Savannah and I had a little prayer upstairs to sort out what we were going to do.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like you know someone for 12 years, you know them inside and out then all a sudden a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018We don\u2019t know all the facts but there are no allegations of an affair but allegations of a crime, and that\u2019s shocking for all of us here who have sat with Matt for many, many years, so we will continue to process this part of this horrific story and our thoughts are with Brooke.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not easy what she did to come forward.\u2019\n\nLauer said in a statement that Nevils\u2019 claims are \u2018categorically false\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nSavannah concluded: \u2018I think I speak for all of us when I say we are disturbed to our core.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLauer said in a statement that Nevils\u2019 claims are \u2018categorically false\u2019 and that she \u2018ignores the facts and defies common sense\u2019.\n\nIn April 2018, Matt claimed he\u2019d tried to \u2018protect\u2019 his family from \u2019embarrassment\u2019 by staying silent at the time of allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe presenter admitted he had \u2018acted inappropriately\u2019, but he also insisted that many of the allegations made against him were \u2018absolutely false\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
