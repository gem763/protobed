They now say it went from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet in England via a ferry.\n\nThe 39 people were found dead early Wednesday at an industrial park in southeast England. Details about the victims have not been released except that one was a teenager.\n\nThe 25-year-old driver of the truck, who was from Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.", "description": "The 25-year-old driver, has been arrested on suspicion of murder", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT862_Englan_ZG_20191023113848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
