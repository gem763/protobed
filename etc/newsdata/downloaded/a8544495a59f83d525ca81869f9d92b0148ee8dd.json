So what\u2019s a modern person to do in the event that they don\u2019t have their phone or a compass and need to know which way is north? Here are a few strategies to point you in the right direction.\n\nUse the sun\n\nThis is pretty basic info, but the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. If you\u2019re trying to figure out which direction you\u2019re facing during sunrise or sunset, paying attention to where the sun is moving is your best bet.\n\nBut what about the rest of the day? For this, we turn to the Pursuing Outdoors for another method:\n\nFirst, we need to find a clean patch of land that gets a lot of direct sunlight. Then, we need to find a stick and plant it in the ground. Once we have done that, we will be able to see the stick\u2019s shadow. We should place a mark at the tip of it. After about 30 minutes, the tip of the shadow will move and we will need to mark it again. Now that we have two points, we can connect them with a line. That line will give us a rough idea of the east-west direction.\n\nUnfortunately, this will only really work on a sunny day, but it\u2019s a handy trick to know. Also, it should go without say, but never look directly into the sun.\n\nUse an analogue watch\n\nTelling time on a non-digital clock or watch is becoming a lost art, but if you\u2019re in need of a compass and happen to be wearing an analogue watch, you\u2019re in luck. Actually, even if you have a fancy digital watch, all you need to do is visualise the hands on the dial. Then try this trick from Kirk Reynolds, CEO and guide at Discover Outdoors via Mental Floss:\n\nTake the watch off and align the hour hand with the sun. Imagine a line that intersects the halfway point between the hour and 12:00. That line is pointing south. For example, if it\u2019s 4:00, the halfway line will be pointing to 2:00... If you\u2019re in the Southern hemisphere, align the sun with 12:00 and the imaginary line will be pointing north.\n\nFind a church\n\nIf you happen to be in a city or some sort of town, look for a Christian church and/or graveyard. As we mentioned in a previous post, Christian churches are typically aligned west-east, with the main altar at the eastern end, facing sunrise. Gravestones are also usually aligned west-east.\n\nLook to the stars\n\nIf you\u2019re in need of a compass and it\u2019s nighttime, look to the stars for help figuring out which direction you\u2019re facing. According to Reynolds, you should look for Orion:\n\nOrion is a constellation that rises in the east and sets in the west. Look for Orion\u2019s belt, the three stars in the middle that form a line. They are pointing east/west and Orion\u2019s sword, which hangs from the belt, points south.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t much help if it\u2019s cloudy at night, but at least it\u2019s an option.\n\nThis story was originally published on 6/10/06 and was updated on 25/10/19 to provide more thorough and current information.", "description": "Now that we all have GPS and Google Maps on our phones, we\u2019ve gotten pretty bad at reading actual, paper maps and knowing which direction we\u2019re facing.
