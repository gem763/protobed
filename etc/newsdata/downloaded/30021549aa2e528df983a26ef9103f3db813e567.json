The thought of Graham being in a relationship has undoubtedly made the Home Farm businesswoman jealous, so \u2014 with Jamie (Alexander Lincoln) having discovered that Graham\u2019s other woman is none other than Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) tonight \u2014 could Kim set about seeking revenge as a result?\n\nWith Graham having developed a relationship with Rhona, his priorities have understandably been elsewhere as of late. However, this is something that Kim has picked up on, and thus she\u2019s made it her mission to try and find out why her business partner has been so distant with her. She believes that Graham is seeing another woman \u2014 and she discussed this with Jamie in tonight\u2019s episode.\n\nJamie begged Kim to be honest, and \u2014 in spite of some initial backtracking \u2014 she eventually admitted that she is jealous of this mystery woman, and that she\u2019d hoped a relationship between her and Graham might\u2019ve been a possibility one day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie was shocked by his mum\u2019s honesty, having never seen her speak so openly about her feelings before. However, he later made a shocking discovery when \u2014 sitting in his car outside the veterinary practice \u2014 he spotted a loved-up Graham arriving at Rhona\u2019s, before the two lovers shared a kiss.\n\nJamie was noticeably shocked, and he\u2019s no doubt going to be conflicted about what to do for the best. After the heart-to-heart with his mum, will he feel compelled to reveal what he knows?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a possibility, but then again, Jamie\u2019s got a good relationship with Rhona himself, and informing Kim about what he saw could jeopardise said relationship \u2014 not to mention his working environment considering he works at the vets.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a much more important question here, and that\u2019s: if Kim does discover the truth \u2014 will she seek revenge?\n\nKim and Rhona were friends once, but a lot has happened since then, and there\u2019s a lot of animosity between them now, so Kim will no doubt feel angry should she learn Rhona is the other woman.\n\nSeeking revenge on Rhona is one thing, but could she also perhaps seek revenge on Graham? She\u2019ll no doubt feel betrayed by Graham for entering into a relationship with one of her adversaries.\n\nHell hath no fury like Kim Tate.\n\nEmmerdale continues Thursday 31stOctober at 7pm on ITV.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Lydia Hart discovers the identity of her secret benefactor?\n\nMORE: Emmerdale star confirms long-term split for Cain and Moira Dingle\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kim's no doubt going to have a lot to say about Jamie's discovery, and she's proven in the past how far she's willing to go for revenge.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29_10_emm_jamie_kim_01_0-5570_1572438442.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
