Utilizing this platform, the FBI said that Gilliam did significant fundraising and made \u201cthe false pretense that the contributions were for a youth basketball team and/or school supplies for underprivileged children.\u201d\n\nAll told, Gilliam stole $87,215 from the AAU program.\n\nGilliam took the funds, and rather than invest in the team, he spent the money \u201con luxury designer clothing, expensive meals, and personal trips to various locations.\u201d As part of his plea deal, Gilliam agreed to make full restitution for the stolen money.\n\n\u201cWhen a scheme depletes charity for children, it's unconscionable but when the fraud is perpetrated by someone the public trusts, it damages the community's confidence in their public servants,\u201d said Gregory W. Ehrie, FBI special agent in charge.\n\n\u201cThis defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children. The FBI is committed to uncovering fraud and corruption. If you break the law, no matter who you are, you will face the consequences.\u201d\n\nAn FBI raid last December of the mayor\u2019s home recovered $41,000 of the lost funds.\n\nThe program was hailed by the local media for instilling character in its players. Of note, there is no evidence of Gilliam defrauding or stealing from taxpayers or Atlantic City.\n\nAlthough Gilliam has voluntarily begun the process of paying back the money that he stole, he isn\u2019t in the clear yet. The Atlantic City mayor faces sentencing in January and could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of \u201c$250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Atlantic City mayor Frank Gilliam pleaded guilty on Thursday of defrauding a youth basketball team of tens of thousands of dollars.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP-Frank-Gilliam.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
