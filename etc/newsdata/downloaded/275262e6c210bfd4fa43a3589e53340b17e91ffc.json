As evidence: \u201cI get compliments and asked \u2018Where\u2019s that from?\u2019 every single time I wear one of my silk blouses,\u201d says writer and Everlaneologist Robin Reetz. There\u2019s a bunch of summery silk in Everlane\u2019s Choose What You Pay section right now, but this relaxed silk button-down is especially suited to September\u2019s transitional weather \u2014 cool enough to wear something warmer than a T-shirt but still too hot to commit to a sweater. In terms of style, this is a straight-up dupe for the versatile button-downs from Parisian brand Equipment, meaning it\u2019s an easy shirt to throw on and dress up (or down) for any occasion.
