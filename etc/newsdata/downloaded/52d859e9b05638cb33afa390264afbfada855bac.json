According to Opeyemi Sowore \u2014 who lives in New Jersey \u2014 her husband was detained in Lagos on August 4th while at a protest. He was then transferred to Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nPer social media and press reporting, Omoyele Sowore (who goes by Sowore), was participating in #RevolutionNow movement of peaceful demonstration against bad governance in Nigeria.\n\nAfter several hearings, he is still being held in Abuja, his wife said.\n\nAccording to a copy of his court charging document obtained by TechCrunch, Sowore is charged with two counts of conspiring to stage a revolution and to remove Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, from office \u201cotherwise than by constitutional means.\u201d\n\nSowore is also charged with cybercrimes for \u201cknowingly send[ing] messages by means of a press interview granted on Arise Television\u2026for the purpose of causing insult\u2026and ill-will on the\u2026President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u201d and for money laundering based on a transfer of $19,975 from a Nigerian bank account to a Sahara Reporters held account in New York.\n\nSowore pleaded not guilty to the charges and rejected an offer of bail for roughly $800,000, according to press reports and his wife.\n\nAs for the veracity of the charges, Sowore\u2019s wife Opeyemi believes they are a cover to go after her husband for his activism and work with Sahara Reporters.\n\nSowore has never been an advocate of violence or insurrection, according to his wife.\n\n\u201cIf you look at his history he is the most peaceful person. He does what he does so Nigeria can work for all Nigerians\u2026be inclusive of all ethnic groups, all socio-economic backgrounds, and religions,\u201d Opeyemi Sowore said.\n\n\u201cI think the charges are about silencing a critical voice that\u2019s shining light on corruption,\u201d she added.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Sowore and Sahara Reporters\u2019 work, particularly in Nigeria. The country has has made strides in improving infrastructure and governance and has one of Africa\u2019s strongest economies and tech scenes.\n\nBut Nigeria is still plagued by corruption, particularly around its oil-resources, and has a steady-stream of multi-billion dollar scandals \u2014 yes billions \u2014 in state related funds being stolen or simply going missing.\n\nSahara Reporters has made a practice of reporting on such corruption. The site, which has a tips line and small TV station, has exposed improprieties of many public officials and forced a number of resignations in Nigeria\u2019s government.\n\nIn the previous administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, Sahara Reporters played a role in exposing the theft of an estimated $20 billion in public funds by Petroleum Minister, Diezani Allison-Madueke, who was forced to resign and eventually arrested.\n\nThe internet, mobile, and digital media play a central role in the work of Sahara Reporters. In an interview in 2014, Sowore explained to me how these mediums often do much of the investigative work.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, there\u2019s less investigation to breaking these stories than you\u2019d think. The corruption and who\u2019s perpetrating it is generally well-known and the evidence easy to distribute through social media and devices. We just need a safe place to report it from, and the rest often takes care of itself,\u201d Sowore said.\n\nIronically, Sowre\u2019s own thesis of using digital and social media for advocacy may be tested on his getting out of jail.\n\nSowore\u2019s wife is working on a campaign of global supporters \u2014 including Amnesty International \u2014 to shine a light on her husband\u2019s charges, innocence, and press for his release.\n\nAway from the activism and politics, \u201cI want Yele to come home safely. I\u2019m worried about his safety and we have two small children and they miss their father dearly,\u201d Opeyemi Sowore said.\n\nThe trial for her husband Omoyele Sowore is scheduled for early November.", "description": "The founder of African investigative digital media site Sahara Reporters Omoyele Sowore remains detained in Nigeria on charges including treason, his wife Opeyemi Sowore told TechCrunch.
