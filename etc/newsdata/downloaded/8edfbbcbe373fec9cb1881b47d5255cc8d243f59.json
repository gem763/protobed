Synth pop from the '80s blared as a cast of models trotted down the runway in bondage-inspired get-ups. Bloggers\u2014and in one instance, a blogger\u2019s assistant\u2014selfied from their seats. Nothing looked out of the ordinary. But the designer, Xiaojuan Yang, almost didn\u2019t make it to her own party.\n\nAs reported last month by The New York Post, Yang and her staff went to the American consulate in Guangzhou, China, to apply for a B1 visa for entrance to the United States. They were rejected. The I Love Pretty team guessed, but could not confirm, that Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war with the country could be the reason for their headache.\n\nMeng Ji, a PR consultant for I Love Pretty and Yang\u2019s interpreter, told The Daily Beast that the team managed to wrangle a new interview at a different consulate, giving the designer \u201ca second chance to explain her case.\u201d She was finally granted a visa, and Ji surmised that the press attention from The New York Post and other outlets helped put pressure on the State Department.\n\nSpeaking backstage at her show on September 6, Yang told The Daily Beast she was \u201cdevastated\u201d when she heard she might not make her label\u2019s first presentation in New York. \u201cI am so in love with America and New York, but it crashed, burned down, everything,\u201d Yang said through Ji\u2019s translation. \u201cI have been all over the world, and I still was rejected.\u201d\n\nBut a few minutes before her show began, as Billy Idol\u2019s \u201cDancing With Myself\u201d warmed up the crowd, Yang felt no hard feelings. She wore a camel blazer over a translucent white button-up with a garter on her leg and a syringe pin at her lapel.\n\nBedazzled needles were a recurring, if strange, motif in her collection, with one model carrying an oversized one as a clutch. For each guest there was one of the most unusual NYFW free gifts ever: headphones in the guise of a stethoscope.\n\n\u201cI feel more appreciative now that I got a visa for this show and it\u2019s finally happening,\u201d Yang said. \u201cRight now, my brand is growing so fast, and there are so many things happening.\u201d\n\nOnce models did start to walk, the clothing was joyous, if somewhat predictable. Yang favored a palette of bubblegum pink, which felt very calming and appropriate for an early-morning show, though the color has been used to death by now.\n\nThere was plenty of mesh, latex, and see-through fabrics paired with more demure trouser pants, like what a dominatrix would wear home to ask their parents if they could borrow some money.\n\nOne blush, mock-neck blouse with flouncy sleeves came blazed with the words, \u201cDon\u2019t Look at Me Like That\u201d over the chest, with two pasties covering the model\u2019s nipples. Each look required some chutzpah to pull off, though Yang hoped to call attention to more than just fleshy dressing.\n\n\u201cRight now in all of the metropolitan cities, there are a lot of women who are very lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cDepression is a serious issue that a lot of people ignore, and I wanted to bring the focus of the audience to this particular topic. Behind every successful woman\u2019s career, there is always a different story.\u201d\n\n-Alaina Demopoulos\n\nThe dapperQ queer fashion event kicked off New York Fashion Week at Brooklyn Museum on Thursday night. A celebration of diversity, the show was a beacon of inclusivity in both fashion and life.\n\nUndergarments by TomBoy subverted idealized standards of beauty; glistening bedazzled bodies walked and used wheelchairs down the catwalk.\n\nDesigner Claire Fleury channeled Andy Warhol and Pierre Cardin with fabulously outrageous ensembles: a spectacle of both color and reimagined silhouettes.\n\nThe '60s were alive and well in designer Andre Landeros Michel's dark, romantic and sparkly collection, which was accented by a silver lam\u00e9 suit worn by a model with a perfectly coiffed afro.\n\nBlurring the lines between genders, cultures and fantasy, Devonation provided comparatively subtle yet edgy garments.\n\nAn all-in-one garment by Cilium was the single piece that provided multiple ensembles for a range of body types.\n\n-Sarah Shears", "description": "Chinese designer Xiaojuan Yang nearly missed her NYFW debut amid a messy visa process and the tariff war.
