It was rejected.\n\nOver 500 years later, an MIT team has recreated the design with a model and have showed that it would have worked.\n\nDa Vinci's design incorporates architectural techniques that would have not been seen for another 300 years.\n\nResearchers at MIT have proven Leonardo da Vinci correct yet again, this time involving his design for what would have been at the time a revolutionary bridge design. Although clients rejected da Vinci's work at the time, over 500 years later, the researchers have proven that his bridge would have worked.\n\nThe famed Renaissance Man made his living working with wealthy patrons\u2014people like Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who commissioned his painting \"The Last Supper.\" But da Vinci did not want to limit himself to Italian patrons. When Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire put out a request for proposals for a bridge connecting capital city Constantinople (now Istanbul) with its neighbor city Galata, da Vinci was eager for the chance to win the contract.\n\nDa Vinci's proposal was radically different than the standard bridge at the time. As described by the MIT group, it was approximately 918 feet long (218 meters, though neither system of measurement had been developed yet) and would have consisted of a flattened arch \"tall enough to allow a sailboat to pass underneath with its mast in place...but that would cross the wide span with a single enormous arch,\" according to an MIT press statement. It would have been the longest bridge in the world at the time by a significant measure, using an unheard of style of design.\n\nIt wasn't just length or style that set da Vinci's bridge apart. It also had safety features unheard of at the time. One of the biggest challenges facing any bridge design is that it has to exist in nature no matter the conditions, including wind.\n\nStrong winds have forced many bridge, including relatively modern bridges from the 20th century, into lateral oscillations leading to collapse. Da Vinci would have added what are known as wing walls, abutments out to the side of the bridge, steadying it during harsh conditions. They are now common design elements of modern bridges.\n\nPhoto credit: Karly Bast and Michelle Xie More\n\n\"It's incredibly ambitious,\" says recent graduate student Karly Bast, who worked on the project with professor of architecture and of civil and environmental engineering John Ochsendorf and undergraduate Michelle Xie on the project. \"It was about 10 times longer than typical bridges of that time.\"\n\nBast, Oschsendorf, and Xie analyzed available documents regarding the bridge, the possible materials and construction methods of the period, and the geographic conditions of the river estuary then known as the Golden Horn, now called Hali\u00e7, where the Sultan wanted the bridge.\n\nDa Vinci's sketches and letters to the Sultan regarding the bridge can be found in what's known as Manuscript L, a small Codex stored in the Institut de France in Paris. Da Vinci wrote that\n\nI, your faithful servant, understand that it has been your intention to erect a bridge from Galata (Pera) to Stambul\u2026 across the Golden Horn (\u2018Hali\u00e7\u201d), but this has not been done because there were no experts available. I, your subject, have determined how to build the bridge. It will be a masonry bridge as high as a building, and even tall ships will be able to sail under it.\n\nHe does not specify what materials he would need, but the team assumed that da Vinci was talking about stone\u2014neither wood or brick would have been able to sustain a bridge of that size at the time. The word \"masonry\" also tipped off the team to a design strategy. Like the classic masonry bridges of ancient Rome, with which da Vinci would have been familiar, it would stand solely through the forces of physics and gravity with no need for fasteners or mortar.", "description": "If accepted at the time, the design would have likely revolutionized architecture.", "authors": ["David Grossman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8_uGxywm9mHmvfeii_l9mw--~B/aD0zMjI7dz02Mzk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/7324999925f29d99a92a1fe3a5962e32", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
