Last month, President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration would ban all flavored e-cigarettes \u2014 except tobacco-flavored ones \u2014 in an effort to stem the increase in youth vaping. The plan has not been issued yet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuul said the sales suspension is the result of a review of Juul\u2019s practices by new chief executive K.C. Crosthwaite. The former Altria executive became Juul\u2019s CEO in late September, after Kevin Burns stepped down.\n\nCrosthwaite said in a statement that he wanted to \u201creset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers.\u201d\n\nCritics weren\u2019t satisfied. Juul\u2019s announcement \u201cshows that it hasn\u2019t changed one bit under its new leadership and isn\u2019t serious about preventing youth use,\u201d said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. He said the company knows the latest data shows \u201cthat 64 percent of high school e-cigarette users now use mint or menthol flavors and this number is growing all the time.\u201d He called on the administration to move forward with its plan to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market, including mint and menthol.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGreg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said Juul\u2019s move was \u201ccowardly\u201d and would hurt adults who use e-cigarettes to stop smoking. The company \u201chas made it clear time and time again that they will not fight for their adult customers, many of whom rely on JUUL\u2019s flavored products to stay smoke-free,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nBesides concerns about a continued rise in youth vaping, health authorities also are worried about the emergence of a mysterious vaping-related lung disease. Most, but not all, of the people who have fallen ill have used illicit THC, health authorities say. In an update provided Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there are at least 1,479 lung-injury cases and 33 deaths linked to vaping.\n\nThe planned FDA ban on flavored e-cigarettes, as described by officials last month, would \u201cclear the market\u201d of almost all flavored vaping products. Those products would not be allowed back on the market unless the agency authorized them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuul, which has said it opposes youth use of its products, finds itself at the center of a storm over underage vaping. Late last year, under pressure from federal regulators, Juul agreed to stop selling most sweet and fruity products in retail outlets and instead to make them available only on its website with stepped-up age verification. Federal data released last month showed the mint and menthol flavor pods that Juul continued to sell in stores have become increasingly popular among young people.\n\nLast month, as the controversy about youth e-cigarette use intensified, Juul suspended broadcast, print and digital advertising in the United States, stopped supporting an effort to overturn San Francisco\u2019s flavored-tobacco ban and said it would refrain from lobbying the administration on its planned flavor ban.\n\nThe company said it believes flavored products, coupled with measures to combat underage use, can help adults stop smoking. It said it is evaluating which flavored products it will submit to the FDA for approval.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe continue to review our policies and practices in advance of FDA\u2019s flavor guidance and have not made any final decisions,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe company said it believes the FDA review process is the best way to determine whether the items will benefit public health \u2014 the standard the agency will use in approving new products.\n\nMeanwhile, a new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 52 percent of the public supports a ban on the sale of fruit-flavored and other flavored e-cigarettes, while 44 percent opposes it.\n\nThe poll found more than 80 percent of adults say they believe teenagers who would otherwise not smoke cigarettes are using flavored vaping products. At the same time, more than 30 percent of adults said they believe e-cigarettes are a safer alternative for tobacco smokers who are trying to quit.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The e-cigarette company, under fire from critics accusing it of fueling a surge in youth vaping, is suspending sales of mango, creme, fruit and cucumber available \u2014 only through the company's website.", "authors": ["Laurie Mcginley", "Reporter Covering Health"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2pcZHY6k0-8eP5_i08nM_ABPWYY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JT3DHZXQ2UI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
