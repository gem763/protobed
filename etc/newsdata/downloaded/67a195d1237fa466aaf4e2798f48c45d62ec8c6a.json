We\u2019ve tried to anticipate some of the most common questions people may have here, and we\u2019ll be adding to this list as more questions come up.\n\nQ1: What are personal pronouns, and why are they relevant to the Code of Conduct?\n\nPersonal pronouns are a way to refer to a person without using their name, when the subject is known. From mypronouns.org:\n\nThe vast majority of people go by the pronouns sets \u201che/him\u201d or \u201cshe/her.\u201d A small but increasing number of people use \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns or another pronouns set -- sometimes simply because they don\u2019t want to go by pronouns with a gender association (just as some folks go by \u201cMs.\u201d whether or not they are married, because they don\u2019t think their marital status should be a relevant issue), and sometimes people use pronouns that aren\u2019t associated with one of those two most common (binary) genders because they are nonbinary (i.e. people who are neither exclusively a man nor exclusively a woman -- e.g. genderqueer, agender, bigender, fluid, third/additional gender in a cultural tradition, etc.).\n\nThe goal of our Code of Conduct is to help us \u201cbuild a community that is rooted in kindness, collaboration, and mutual respect.\u201d Using someone\u2019s pronouns is a way of showing respect for them and refusing to do so causes harm.\n\nQ2: What does the Code of Conduct say about gender pronouns?\n\nThe Code of Conduct has two direct references to gender pronouns:\n\n\u201cUse stated pronouns (when known).\u201d \u201cPrefer gender-neutral language when uncertain.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re asking everyone to do two things. First, if you do know someone\u2019s pronouns (e.g. because they told you), then use them as you normally would use any pronoun. Second, if you don\u2019t know someone\u2019s pronouns, use gender-neutral language rather than making an assumption.\n\nQ3: What should I do if I make a mistake and use the wrong pronouns?\n\nIf you make a mistake, apologize and correct your mistake if possible (e.g. by editing your post). We recognize that this may be new to many people, particularly members of our community who do not speak English as a first language, and so mistakes will happen as we all learn together.\n\nQ4: What should I do if I see someone using the wrong pronouns?\n\nIf you notice someone who is using the wrong pronouns for someone else who has stated them (e.g. in a comment or on their profiles), we encourage you to gently correct them in a comment. Do not state pronouns for third parties who have not done so in Stack Exchange (eg. You know them in person). If the situation escalates, please flag what you see. A moderator or community manager will look into it further.\n\nQ5: How will this be moderated? Will we ban people based on one mistake?\n\nWe understand that miscommunication or mistakes may happen, so most situations will just result in a gentle correction or warning. As with any violation of the Code of Conduct, in cases of willful, repeated, or abusive behavior, warnings may escalate to account suspensions and/or expulsion.\n\nQ6: What should I do if I don't know someone's pronouns?\n\nWhen in doubt, use gender-neutral language or refer to the user by name.\n\nQ7: Are we going to force everyone to identify their pronouns?\n\nNo. Just as we do not force users to identify their real name, we will never force users to identify their pronouns. This is a voluntary decision by each user to share as much or as little as they are comfortable.\n\nQ8: How should I identify my pronouns if I choose to do so?\n\nWhether and how you identify your pronouns is up to you. If you choose to do so, add it to the \u201cAbout Me\u201d section of your user profile.\n\nQ9: Do I have to use pronouns I\u2019m unfamiliar or uncomfortable with (e.g., neopronouns like xe, zir, ne... )?\n\nYes, if those are stated by the individual.\n\nQ10: What if I believe it is grammatically incorrect to use some pronouns (e.g. they/them to refer to a single person)?\n\nIf they are the pronouns stated by the individual, you must respect that and use them. Grammar concerns do not override a person\u2019s right to self identify.\n\nQ11: If I\u2019m uncomfortable with a particular pronoun, can I just avoid using it?\n\nWe are asking everyone to use all stated pronouns as you would naturally write. Explicitly avoiding using someone\u2019s pronouns because you are uncomfortable is a way of refusing to recognize their identity and is a violation of the Code of Conduct.\n\nQ12: Does this mean I\u2019m required to use pronouns when I normally wouldn\u2019t?\n\nWe are asking everyone to use all stated pronouns as you would naturally write. You are not required to insert pronouns where you otherwise would not.\n\nQ13: How does this apply to languages other than English?\n\nFor now, while the intent of being inclusive and respectful of all gender identities applies to all our communities, the specific requirements around pronoun usage apply only to English language sites. As we determine best practices in other languages, we\u2019ll work with those communities and update guidance for those languages.\n\nQ14: Should all posts be written using gender-inclusive language? Should we edit all old posts to be gender-inclusive?\n\nThe focus of this change is on using correct pronouns when addressing other members of the community. However, writing posts in a gender-inclusive way is encouraged and a great way to make the community more accessible to more people. If you are writing or editing a post and can make it gender-inclusive without changing the meaning, you are encouraged to do so.\n\nReturn to FAQ index", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://meta.stackexchange.com/content/Sites/stackexchangemeta/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=c34d758b103d", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
