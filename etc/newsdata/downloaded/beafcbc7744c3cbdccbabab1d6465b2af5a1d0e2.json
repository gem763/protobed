Mark Amodei was not prepared for the backlash from his fellow Republicans when he said Congress needed to \u201cfollow the facts\u201d and look into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached.\n\nNewspapers declared he was breaking ranks. Conservative constituents branded him a traitor: \u201cI\u2019m Brutus, and Trump\u2019s Julius Caesar,\u201d he said. In short order, he was forced to explain himself to the Trump campaign\u2019s political director, top House Republicans and the acting White House chief of staff. All had the same question: \u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d\n\nAs evidence mounts that Trump engaged in an intensive effort to pressure the leader of Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Amodei is one of a growing number of Republicans who, while not explicitly endorsing the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, are at least indicating an openness to it. None have said Trump should be impeached. But neither are they defending him.\n\nIt is a politically delicate but increasingly common approach among independent-minded lawmakers like Amodei, who are working to balance their fear of inviting Trump\u2019s wrath \u2014 and that of the party base \u2014 with a deep anxiety that there is more to be revealed about the president, some of it potentially indefensible, and the knowledge that history will hold them accountable for their words and actions.\n\nIn Michigan, Rep. Fred Upton told an audience at the Detroit Economic Club that while he did not support an impeachment inquiry, \u201cthere are legitimate questions\u201d about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, and he had no problem with Democrats\u2019 efforts to get more information.\n\n\u201cWe need to know what the answers are,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Texas, Rep. Will Hurd \u2014 who is retiring, and therefore perhaps feeling liberated to speak his mind \u2014 has called on the House to investigate the \u201ctroubling\u201d allegations against Trump, though he cautioned against a rush to impeachment. In Pennsylvania, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said he thinks law enforcement should investigate. In Illinois, Rep. Adam Kinzinger said, \u201cI want to know what happened here.\u201d\n\nIn Maine, Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican whose seat is seen by Democrats as especially vulnerable, also criticized Trump\u2019s decision to call on China to investigate a political rival. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate,\u201d she told the Bangor Daily News on Saturday.\n\nAnd in Utah, Sen. Mitt Romney, who has emerged as a lonely voice criticizing Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, and last week called the president\u2019s appeal for foreign help investigating the Bidens \u201cwrong and appalling,\u201d appears to have company. Before a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump was made public, a fellow Utahan, Rep. John Curtis, introduced a resolution calling for the White House to release it, and he has said he is \u201cclosely monitoring the formal inquiry.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, in a warning shot to Republicans who might cross him, Trump lashed out at Romney on Twitter, calling him a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning\u201d and using the hashtag #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.\u201d\n\nAs they distance themselves from Trump, these Republicans \u2014 some in swing districts in tight reelection races \u2014 are also taking care to distance themselves from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who they say rushed into the impeachment inquiry. For the most part they are refraining from directly criticizing the president, who has branded the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nFox News plays on a television in a residence in Gardnerville, Nev., on Oct. 3, 2019.
