This is 11pc less than the grid's initial request for funding.\n\nThe transmission giant said it would continue to work with Ofgem to ensure a fair result but will seek to change its mind.", "description": "National Grid has vowed to challenge regulators after funding was slashed for a scheme linking up the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.", "authors": ["Vinjeru Mkandawire", "Oliver Gill", "Matthew Lynn", "Russell Lynch"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000071474406-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNUHzxaamNmHDqK-YksWRz2o-yMLyYquKCawpyDOW254.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
