Take Back Control. It\u2019s the Economy, Stupid. F**k the Tories. That sort of thing. The art is to craft a message that is clear in intent, but which can mean different things to different people.\n\nSo how are we to judge: \u201cGet Ready\u201d? These are the two words that head up the government\u2019s \u00a3100m campaign to ensure that we, the public, are prepared for Brexit. Apparently, they considered dusting off Take Back Control, but thought better of it.\n\nOnly I\u2019ve wasted about an hour reading about CE conformity assessments and tariff-rate quotas on the new \u201cGet Ready\u201d site and I\u2019m still not sure what I\u2019m getting ready for. To rumble, as per Ant and Dec, 1994? Or for the train that is a-coming, as per Curtis Mayfield, 1965? (\u201cThere ain\u2019t no room for the hopeless sinner / Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own\u201d). For rationing and medicine shortages? Or for pro-democracy protests and form-filling? No one wrote anything about that on the side of a bus, as far as I recall.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of impressive that three years on from the referendum, we are no closer to learning what Brexit actually entails. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get a deal and there\u2019s a good chance that we won\u2019t,\u201d Boris Johnson unclarified in his interview with The Sunday Times. It remains \u201cmad riddle\u201d, as Danny Dyer once put it.\n\nBut while the WHAT remains nebulous, the HOW is taking shape. People, get ready... for a prime minister stuffing the House of Lords with Brexit ultras, deselecting Conservative MPs who disagree with him, asking his \u201cally\u201d, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to do his dirty work with the EU while forcing the Queen to overrule parliament so that he can get his way. We don\u2019t know what that \u201cway\u201d is. But that shouldn\u2019t worry us since Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is the embodiment of the will of the people, so whatever he decides upon MUST be in our interests.\n\n\u201cAre you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people and plunge this country into chaos?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr are you going to side with those of us who want to get on, deliver on the mandate of the people and focus with absolute, laser-like precision on the domestic agenda.\u201d By way of a bribe: billions upon billions of spending promises that make you wonder what the point of nine years of miserable Tory austerity really was.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nSo far, Johnson has been able to build his career on constructive ambiguity. I don\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t know who he is; we really should by now. I mean that he grabs hold of principles when they suit him and drops them when they don\u2019t. He is a One Person Tory before he is a One Nation Tory. In one of the most characteristic lines in his interview, he pulls back from an un-PC carbon-fuelled analogy while describing his spending plans: \u201cI was going to say [we\u2019re going] \u2018full throttle\u2019 except that would be to use a metaphor from the era of hydrocarbon-fuelled transport which we\u2019re now leaving behind...\u201d\n\nQuips like that aren\u2019t incidental to his appeal among Conservatives. Humour has allowed him to square circles, make retrograde stances seem progressive and vice versa. He is the man who wrote the pro-Leave and a prove-Remain column, the man who might get us a deal or might not. You don\u2019t know! He can paint proroguing parliament as a completely normal piece of procedure and also as a genius tactical move, like \u201cbringing a submachine gun to a knife fight\u201d, as one acolyte stupidly put it.\n\nWhat we do know is that once Johnson has grabbed his principle, he will barge ahead with it. We don\u2019t know how he will pentagon the ellipse of the Irish backstop. Michel Barnier insists that it cannot be done. But no matter! Johnson has the rugby ball, and the backstop is a mere Japanese school child in his path. This is the spirit in which he clearly intends to govern.\n\nBut at some point, he will smack into reality.\n\nPrime ministers are always undone by what at first seems to be their strength. And it is palpably absurd for him to claim that he represents the people. His legitimacy stems from 90,000 or so paid-up Conservative activists. The legitimacy of parliament stems from the 32 million people who voted in the 2017 general election. Moreover, the Conservatives won the most votes in that election by promising to sign \u201cthe best possible deal with the European Union\u201d. There are clearly many Leavers who don\u2019t give a damn about that at this point. There are many who will make sleight of hand arguments to imply that all 17.4 million Leave voters are as one.\n\nBut at the street protests that erupted at the weekend, there was something more visceral in the air. Johnson is trashing the British constitution as if he were still in the Bullingdon Club. A member of the elite is claiming that he matters more than you. The public schoolboys are cheating. Fair play isn\u2019t being served. It\u2019s easy to understand that. It\u2019s democracy, stupid.", "description": "It\u2019s the simple messages that cut through in politics. Take Back Control.
