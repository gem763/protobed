The Trump administration now finds itself fixing bayonets with congressional Democrats, as they prepare to impeach him for having a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Okay, okay\u2014there is this shoddy allegation that Trump threatened to withhold military aid unless Zelensky opened an investigation into Hunter Biden. The transcript of the call, which was released last week, debunks all of that. There was no quid pro quo.\n\nYet, let\u2019s get back to this server bit (via UK Independent):\n\nThe White House has admitted moving details of a telephone call between Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart to a classified server, according to CNN. The admission appears to back up one of the claims made by a whistleblower about efforts to conceal evidence of the controversial call, which has led to an impeachment investigation against the president. In a statement to CNN, a White House official said staff had been directed by National Security Council lawyers to move records of the call to a server usually used to store classified information. They said: \u201cNSC lawyers directed that the classified document be handled appropriately.\u201d\n\nSo, that means we should investigate Obama since...he did the exact same thing (via The Federalist):\n\nFormer national security adviser Susan Rice acknowledged last night that the Obama administration moved transcripts of conversations with foreign leaders onto the same top-secret server where the Trump administration stored his recent phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Appearing at the Texas Tribune Festival, Rice was asked how often this practice was engaged in during the Obama administration, but did not answer that question, saying instead, \u201cWe never moved them over unless they were legitimately, in the contents classified.\u201d Rice did not explain what standard the Obama administration used to determine what was legitimately classified. She said it is rare, although not impossible, that a presidential conversation could be classified to that highest level. The revelation from Rice comes amid media reports and comments from political leaders that have painted the use of this top secret server as proof that Trump was trying to cover up the contents of his conversation with the Ukrainian leader, a full transcript of which the administration has now released to the public.\n\n.@AmbassadorRice: \u201cNormally there is a full, verbatim transcript\u201d of calls like Trump\u2019s w/ the Ukraine president.\n\n\n\nSays he tried to \u201cbury\u201d it on a more secure server, but acknowledges the Obama Admin. sometimes did the same. pic.twitter.com/B6zZNbZsTG \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 27, 2019\n\nIt's almost as if the news media forgot about the last eight years. The liberal media hates Trump. The Democrats hate Trump and their unholy alliance is now trying to remove a duly elected president simply because they don\u2019t like him. For a party that talks about institutional integrity and defending American institutions from evil Trump, they sure are keen on establishing precedents that will\u2026irreparably damage our institutions.", "description": ".09/30/2019 20:06:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/247/faa63a17-ccad-4b03-b14f-3e941519460f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
