Mandatory Credit: Douglas DeFelice-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJones finished 23 of 36 for 336 passing yards and two touchdowns while rushing for a pair of scores, including the winner on fourth-and-5.\n\nThe win required the Bucs missing a 34-yard field goal, and Jones\u2019 performance wasn\u2019t as rosy as the numbers. But his mobility and toughness \u2014 traits that he showed in spades at Duke \u2014 provided encouraging signs.\n\nMobility\n\nJones is no Kyler Murray, but he created often with his legs at Duke, both with speed and strength. That paid dividends immediately on Sunday.\n\nOn one second-quarter drive, Jones evaded Shaq Barrett for an 11-yard scramble on third-and-5 and pulled out of Barrett\u2019s grasp, rolled left and hit Saquon Barkley for 19 yards on third-and-4. He also scurried in for a 7-yard touchdown on a zone-read.\n\nHis other 7-yard score won the game, as Jones waltzed up the middle with defenders\u2019 backs turned in man coverage.\n\nOf course, Jones\u2019 mobility is stark compared to Eli Manning, providing Pat Shurmur options. Shurmur called several bootlegs Sunday, knowing Jones can deliver on the run with a defender bearing down.\n\nToughness\n\nThat ties directly to Jones\u2019 best trait coming out of college: pocket toughness.\n\nManning is certainly tough enough to take hits, but he\u2019s far less capable now. A critical checkpoint as aging quarterbacks decline is when they can\u2019t make standard throws without a clean platform. Much like his brother Peyton near the end of his career, any flash of pressure or forced movement is enough to ruin Eli Manning\u2019s platform, creating many spoiled plays.\n\nJones is tough and capable of throwing amid pressure. Despite five sacks and 11 knockdowns, he was unfazed, actively stepping into behemoths Vita Vea and Ndamukong Suh to throw at times. He occasionally seems oblivious to pressure, which sounds great ... except ...\n\nVision and ball security\n\nDespite the toughness, Jones doesn\u2019t always see or feel when pressure is closing in. His protection \u2014 especially left tackle Nate Solder \u2014 has been faulty, but he has six fumbles through the equivalent of about two full games.\n\nTwo came Sunday, and Jones narrowly avoided two others, including one overturned to an incompletion. The first fumble was most discouraging, when he pulled down a pump fake directly in the face of Barrett, making for an easy strip.\n\nThe rash of fumbles could be a small-sample outlier or speak to narrow vision. Jones missed a few opportunities to step up and avoid pressure Sunday, including on Barrett\u2019s third sack.\n\nMore concerning was Jones\u2019 poor vision and processing on third-and-15 in the second quarter. With time to scan, Jones started left and came back right, where Bennie Fowler ran a dig. With the Bucs in 2-man coverage \u2014 man with two high safeties \u2014 and Fowler the lone receiver to the right, his route was doubled immediately.\n\nBut Jones threw to Fowler anyway. Third-round rookie safety Mike Edwards easily undercut Fowler, but the ball clanked off his hands.\n\nThat was easily Jones\u2019 worst play, but he had other shaky moments, including predetermined reads where he failed to see other receivers open and a near pick-six in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s normal for a rookie, but Jones must learn to see the bigger picture.\n\nFortune, good and bad\n\nJones might want to send Edwards a gift basket this week. On top of the dropped pass, Edwards missed a tackle about 18 yards into Evan Engram\u2019s 75-yard touchdown, then recklessly jumped the tight end\u2019s short crosser to open Darius Slayton\u2019s 46-yard grab. The latter two plays were great designs by Shurmur, but Edwards\u2019 mistakes far worsened the damage.\n\nJones benefited greatly from Shurmur\u2019s scheming, including rub routes against man coverage and shrewd designs against Cover-4, which the Bucs leaned on late. The rookie converted many chances but also missed one just before halftime when Shurmur used a Mills concept to get Russell Shepard free on a deep post.\n\nAt the same time, Jones was unlucky early in the fourth, as Barrett\u2019s second strip-sack came while Jones was winding up for another Mills concept, this time to Fowler.\n\nOverall\n\nJones wasn\u2019t a star like the numbers depict, but he mostly executed well and made timely plays with his feet despite ample pressure. His ball placement wasn\u2019t quite as sharp as in the preseason, as receivers bailed him out on a few nice catches, but he also had pinpoint throws, such as the 7-yard touchdown to Sterling Shepard.\n\nJones should make progress against Washington next week, but meetings with Minnesota and New England in Weeks 5 and 6 will be major tests for his vision and accuracy.\n\nExtra points\n\n\u2014The Giants\u2019 defense has been a disaster, but stubbornness contributed just as much as a lack of talent on Sunday. New York watched Janoris Jenkins get torched by Mike Evans all day but still left the two on an island while trying to protect a one-point lead in the final minute. Jenkins had no chance on Evans\u2019 44-yard gain, which should have sent the Giants to 0-3.\n\n\u2014A year after the jet sweep proliferated, coaches continue to find new wrinkles. The Ravens have been the most creative, using jet motion to give fullback Patrick Ricard a head start as a lead blocker on counter or backside blocker on split zone, or to send Marquise Brown vertical after his motion across. The Raiders\u2019 touchdown to J.J. Nelson on Sunday copied a Bengals\u2019 Week 1 play with the jet-sweep-wheel flea-flicker. And the Rams broke out the jet-sweep reverse for 17 yards to set up their last touchdown on Sunday night.\n\n\u2014Cam Newton\u2019s early struggles with accuracy amid his foot injury shrouded how well-designed Norv Turner\u2019s offense has been. Kyle Allen isn\u2019t Newton, but his ball placement Sunday accentuated another great plan from Turner. D.J. Moore\u2019s 52-yard touchdown was a perfect example, with the \u201cdagger\u201d concept perfectly clearing out quarters coverage and freeing Moore on the dig, whom Allen hit in stride to maximize yards after catch.\n\n\u2014David DeChant (@DavidDeChant), Field Level Media", "description": "Daniel Jones passed another test in his starting debut for the New York Giants on Sunday, a comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433027856&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1MU-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
