Yes, you heard that right \u2014 when Rob Thomas and Santana\u2019s collab \u2019Smooth\u2019 was dominating the radio airwaves and a young Keanu Reeves took the red pill in The Matrix \u2014 the X5 first appeared in BMW showrooms.\n\nNow for the 2019 model year the BMW X5 is all new, and that is a very good thing.\n\n2019 BMW X5 (Credit: BMW) More\n\nConsumers, journalists, car fans, whatever category you fall into, you\u2019ve likely noticed that almost all SUVS are basically cookie-cutter, identical versions of the same vehicle with different badging.\n\nThe X5 range for BMW have been a great seller, and a performance vehicle at that, but they\u2019ve become something of a yawn: competent, but nothing to brag about.\n\nFor 2019, however, Rick Newman and I discovered BMW has given its new X5 some needed oomph in the styling department and tech suite as well.\n\n2019 BMW X5 (Credit: BMW) More\n\nGetting the basics out of the way \u2014 There\u2019s a rear-wheel drive base model as well an all-wheel drive version (xDrive 40i), with a twin-turbo inline 6-cylinder that puts out 335hp and 330 lb-ft of torque. For those looking for more seating, an optional 3rd row seat is available.\n\nWhere the X5 is starting to stand out, is in the looks department. It\u2019s not as beastly as the new X7, but it\u2019s taken some of its better cues, slimmed down a bit, and voil\u00e0 \u2014 you have a sporty-looking SUV.\n\nOur tester was the X5 xDrive50i, which included BMW\u2019s optional aerodynamic kit which gave the X5\u2019s sporting body and even more athletic look, but more importantly, this trim level gives it the heart of a beast.\n\nA powerful engine\n\n2019 BMW X5 (Credit: BMW) More\n\nUnder the hood is BMW\u2019s 4.4L twin-turbo V8, good for a raucous 456 hp and 479 lb-feet of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters, and, because why not, launch control. And for good measure, hanging off the lower rear end like a sonic cannon was BMW\u2019s M Sport performance exhaust system.\n\nTo say this car put a smile on my face upon start-up is an understatement. I was full-on grinning with glee upon hearing the roar out of the exhaust system when that big V8 turned over. Yes, this is why you might spend more on that exhaust system and that engine \u2014 it makes a statement every time.\n\nIn \u2018sport\u2019 mode, throttle response and overall acceleration were at times severe \u2014 but in a good way. What was odd was realizing we were flinging around in an SUV that weighs around 5000 lbs, not an BMW M4 coupe.\n\n2019 BMW X5 (Credit: BMW) More", "description": "For the 2019 model year, the BMW X5 is all new, and that is a very good thing.
