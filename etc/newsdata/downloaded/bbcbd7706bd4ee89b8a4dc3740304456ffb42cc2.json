The Sol, which is available starting today for $199.95, is available in a 45mm focal length for Canon EF, Nikon F, Sony A, Pentax K, Sony E, and Fuji X mounts, and a 22mm version for Micro Four Thirds.\n\nThe Sol is a fully manual, fixed aperture (f/3.5) lens with some unique characteristics. Its fully manual operation, medium to longer focal length, and relatively slow aperture make its use cases rather limited \u2014 it\u2019s basically a lens for portraits in good to great lighting, especially if you\u2019re using it on a camera with an APS-C sized sensor instead of full frame.\n\nBut what makes it a Lensbaby is the Sol\u2019s ability to move the point of focus around the frame, so you can have a small circle of sharp focus anywhere you want that rapidly deteriorates into blur around it. It also has manually adjustable blades that can be positioned in front of the lens to alter the characteristics of the blurred background and add texture to it. It\u2019s a unique effect that I haven\u2019t seen reproduced by other lenses before, and the Sol\u2019s solid metal construction with a knurled focus ring make it easier to pick up and shoot with than the company\u2019s earlier, mostly plastic lenses.\n\nShooting with the Sol on a Fujifilm X-Pro2 for a few weeks has allowed me to learn what the lens is good for and what it\u2019s not good for. Basically, the Sol\u2019s narrow field of view (the Fujifilm has an APS-C sized sensor) and slow aperture makes it difficult to use indoors in poor lighting, and it can be tricky to nail the manual focus every time. But outdoors in good lighting, it\u2019s much easier (it\u2019s also good to enable your camera\u2019s manual focus aids, such as focus peaking, if it has them) and can make for some fun portrait effects.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that everyone will like \u2014 the small area of focus isn\u2019t as tack-sharp as a modern portrait lens and the bokeh blades\u2019 effect is most noticeable with busy backgrounds, where they mostly just make it... busier. It doesn\u2019t replace a standard portrait or zoom lens in any way as it\u2019s not something that works for every image.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as a cheap lens to toss in your bag for when you need to add just that touch of weird to make an image sing, the Sol is about as good as it gets.", "description": "The new Lensbaby Sol is an easier-to-use lens from the company best known for making weird camera lenses.", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PC78UL_YM1jeJmHj3wi1YftDBXo=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11914039/dseifert180802_2782_9040.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-07"}
