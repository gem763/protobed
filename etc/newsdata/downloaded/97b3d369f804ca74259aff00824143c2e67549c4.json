Charles Gosnell, a prominent library-sciences scholar and college librarian in New York, suggested that shifting academic priorities and space constraints threatened to deplete certain book collections, particularly those in highly technical fields such as chemistry, economics, and education. By phasing out the seemingly antiquated books, perhaps libraries would also be divesting themselves of the titles\u2019 particular perspectives or scientific frameworks, many of which could be invaluable. New books had begun to far outnumber older titles in libraries\u2019 collections, a trend that Gosnell described in his article as \u201cbook mortality.\u201d\n\nLibraries pulled through, of course, but then the rise of the internet renewed fears of obsolescence. So far, the internet has not killed libraries either. But the percentage of higher-education budgets dedicated to libraries has been dwindling since the 1980s, and at many institutions there\u2019s been a corresponding drop in reported spending on print materials while that on electronic resources has grown.\n\nLikely in the hopes of proving that they have more to offer than a simple internet connection does, many college libraries are pouring resources into interior-design updates and building renovations, or into \u201cglitzy technology,\u201d such as 3-D printers and green screens, that is often housed in \u201cmedia centers\u201d or \u201cmakerspaces.\u201d", "description": "Schools have been on a mission to reinvent campus libraries\u2014even though students just want the basics.", "authors": ["Alia Wong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_846394189534/facebook.jpg?1570202405", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
