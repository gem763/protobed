Half a world away, President Donald Trump watched the raid in real-time via a video link as troops blasted into the hideout and sent the most-wanted militant running the last steps of his life.\n\nThe daring raid was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work \u2014 and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word that al-Baghdadi would be at a compound in northwestern Syria.\n\nThe night unfolded with methodical precision and unexpected turns. This reconstruction is based on the first-blush accounts of Trump and other administration officials eager to share the details of how the U.S. snared its top target, as well observations from startled villagers who had no idea al-Baghdadi was in their midst.\n\n___\n\nA CELEBRATION AND A SECRET TWO-DAY SCRAMBLE\n\nEvents developed quickly once the White House learned on Thursday there was \u201ca high probability\u201d that al-Baghdadi would be at an Idlib province compound.\n\nBy Friday, Trump had military options on his desk.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the administration at last had \u201cactionable intelligence\u201d it could exploit.\n\nThere was no hint of that interior drama as Trump headed to Camp David on Friday night to celebrate the 10th wedding anniversary of daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Then he was off to Virginia on a brisk fall Saturday for a round at one of his golf courses.\n\nHe teed off with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, in town for the World Series, and Sens. Lindsey Graham and David Perdue.\n\nTrump got back to the White House at 4:18 p.m. By 5 p.m., he was in a suit in the Situation Room in the basement of the West Wing to monitor the raid. They named it after Kayla Mueller, an American humanitarian worker abused and killed by al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe rest of Washington had its focus on Game 4 of the World Series about to get underway a few miles away at Nationals Park.\n\n___\n\nPANIC THEN DEATH\n\nMoments after the White House team had gathered, U.S. aircraft, mostly twin-rotor CH-47 helicopters, took off from Al-Asad air base in western Iraq.\n\nWithin hours, al-Baghdadi was dead.\n\nThe first inkling that something was afoot came when villagers saw helicopters swooping low on the horizon.\n\n\u201cWe went out in the balcony to see and they started shooting, with automatic rifles. So we went inside and hid,\u201d said an unidentified villager. Next came a large explosion \u2014 Trump said soldiers blasted a hole in the side of a building because they feared the entrance might have been booby-trapped. Al-Baghdadi fled into a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that snaked through the compound.\n\nThe stout, bearded militant leader wore a suicide vest and dragged along three children as he fled from the American troops.\n\nTrump, happy to play up the drama, said that as U.S. troops and their dogs closed in, the militant went \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d to his death.\n\n\u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\u201d\n\n___\n\n\u2018IT WAS HIM\u2019\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s body was mutilated in the blast, and the tunnel caved in on him. To get to his corpse, troops had to dig through debris.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much left,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut there are still substantial pieces that they brought back.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the military raid turned into a forensics operation \u2014 and the special forces had come prepared.\n\nThey had brought along samples of al-Baghdadi\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe soldiers who conducted the raid thought the man who fled looked like al-Baghdadi, but that wasn\u2019t enough. Various accounts had heralded his death in the past, only for him to surface yet again.\n\nThis time there could be no doubt.\n\nLab technicians conducted an onsite DNA test to make sure and within 15 minutes of his death, positively identified the target.\n\n\u201cIt was him,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s body wasn\u2019t all they retrieved.\n\nTrump said U.S. troops remained in the compound for about two hours after al-Baghdadi\u2019s death and recovered highly sensitive material about the Islamic State group, including information about its future plans.\n\nAfter the American troops retreated, U.S. fighter jets fired six rockets at the house, leveling it.\n\n___\n\nTHE BIG TEASE\n\nTrump was so excited he couldn\u2019t contain himself.\n\nHe hinted of the successful military operation late Saturday by tweeting obliquely that \u201csomething very big has just happened!\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gidley announced the president would make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d Sunday morning.\n\nThat sent reporters in Washington and the Middle East scrambling, and news organizations soon confirmed that U.S. forces believed they had killed America\u2019s most-wanted man.\n\nIt was a measure of the strained atmosphere in Washington that two top Democrats \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, who heads the House intelligence committee \u2014 didn\u2019t get a heads-up from Trump about the operation.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t trust them to keep it secret.\n\n\u201cWashington is a leaking machine,\u201d Trump said. In this case, he said, \u201cthere were no leaks, no nothing. The only people that knew were the few people that I dealt with.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTHE REVEAL: \u2018THE BIGGEST\u2019\n\nTrump chose the Diplomatic Room to make his big announcement on Sunday.\n\nIn announcing al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, he leaned into comparing the successful operation with the 2011 mission to kill 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nWhile bin Laden orchestrated the deadliest militant attack in U.S. history, the killing of al-Baghdadi \u2014 who helped the IS group at its height control more than 34,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria \u2014 was \u201cthe biggest there is,\u201d Trump said.\n\nReveling in the moment, Trump spent more than 45 minutes speaking and taking questions about the raid.\n\nBy late Sunday afternoon, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign was ready to turn the raid into political capital. It sent a text to supporters that said, \u201cTrump has brought the #1 terrorist leader to justice-he\u2019s KEEPING AMERICA SAFE.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sarah El Deeb in Beirut, Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad and Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "The daring raid was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work \u2014 and 48 hours of hurry-up planning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db66b372000009228506f3d.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
