ONE EXPERT THINKS SO\n\n\"There is certainly a commitment in the archdiocese throughout this archdiocese and its leadership to maintain a safe environment for children,\" Jones said.\n\nHer report found that the archdiocese follows a strict protocol whenever a complaint is received, that no priest or deacon with a substantiated complaint is currently in ministry and the archdiocese is taking steps to support victims of abuse.\n\nZach Hiner, the executive director of \"Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests,\" or SNAP, told Fox in a statement that he's happy the judge is confident in her assessment but he still believes it's another attempt by the church to sweep things under the rug.\n\n\u201cWhile this report is ostensibly an attempt at transparency, it really feels like another move by church officials to handle allegations of abuse in-house,\" Hiner said.\n\nPOPE FRANCIS MADE THIS BIG CHANGE TO LORD'S PRAYER\n\nThe independent review launched a year ago after what Dolan called the \"Summer of Hell,\" which started with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's s report that 300 priests had abused a thousand victims over a 70-year period.\n\nThat sparked a tide of investigations worldwide, culminating in Pope Francis holding an unprecedented meeting with leading world bishops in Rome last February.\n\nThe announcement also comes just weeks after New York State's Child Victims Act opened a one-year window for people who say they were victims of abuse as children, to file lawsuits with no statute of limitations.\n\nAS SATANIC GROUPS RISE, VATICAN OPENS UP EXORCISM SUMMIT TO NON-CATHOLICS\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, more than 700 suits have been filed, with the majority, around 550, against the Catholic Church.\n\nThe clergy abuse crisis has affected the entire U.S. Catholic church's bottom line. In the last 15 years, more than 20 dioceses and Catholic orders have filed for bankruptcy, shelling out tens of millions to settle abuse claims.\n\nSince 2016, the Archdiocese of New York has awarded $67 million in compensation to victims. The Child Victims Act could cost it even more.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"The Child Victims Act,\" Dolan said, \"is just clicking in and we're unaware of the financial impact that's gonna have upon the archdiocese.\"\n\nJudge Jones' says she'll continue to review the archdiocese's handling of clergy sex abuse complaints and response to victims.\n\nBut now the emphasis moves to the Safe Environment Training to ensure the safety of children.", "description": "New York's Archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan can celebrate a bit of good news.", "authors": ["Lauren Green", "Lauren Green Currently Serves As Fox News Channel'S", "Fnc", "Chief Religion Correspondent Based In The New York Bureau.
