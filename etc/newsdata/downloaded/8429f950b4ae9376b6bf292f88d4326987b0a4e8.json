But the navy\u2019s relocation is the most dramatic, and emblematic of a revival of cold war sentiment in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Musk\u00f6 base is unique from a fortification perspective, it is an underground area as big as the old town in Stockholm,\u201d said Rebecca Landberg, head of communications for the Swedish navy.\n\n\u201cThe naval command must have resilience and function even under attack, so Musk\u00f6 is the best option \u2026 the armed forces need to adapt their operations to meet the challenges posed by the deteriorating external environment.\u201d\n\nLike most European nations, Sweden cut its military spending sharply after the cold war ended, from about 2.5% of GDP in 1990 to barely 1% by 2010; equipment was scrapped and bases were closed down. The shipyard on Musk\u00f6 was sold off to German engineering company Thyssen Krupp.\n\nBut the occupation and annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 \u201cchanged things completely\u201d, Granholm said. \u201cIt showed that this is what Russia does to its smaller neighbours. Now it is proving a difficult and long-term task to rebuild the armed forces.\u201d\n\nSwedish defence company Saab bought out Thyssen Krupp in June 2014, after some arm-twisting that involved mass recruitment of Krupp\u2019s staff and a dawn raid by the defence ministry on Krupp\u2019s shipyards in Malm\u00f6, ostensibly to rescue military secrets.\n\nA few months later, Stockholm was gripped with panic after an alleged Russian mini-submarine was spotted in its waters, reviving memories of a Soviet nuclear sub that ran aground in Karlskrona in 1981, sparking a decade of high-profile submarine scares.\n\nThe submarine hunt of 2014, details of which still remain unresolved, saw opinion polls swing towards Nato membership for Sweden and presaged the first of several boosts to defence spending. For the first time in more than two decades, the Swedish government embarked on a sustained expansion of the defence budget, pledging to increase spending from 43bn Swedish crowns (\u00a33.5bn) in 2016 to 50bn in 2020.\n\nOther recent moves to strengthen Sweden\u2019s military preparedness include bringing back conscription, and a leaflet delivered to every household explaining what to do in case of a nuclear attack.\n\nThough Musk\u00f6 ceased to play a central role in Swedish defence in the 1990s, the navy never left the island entirely. When British and Belgian enthusiasts tried to infiltrate the base late last year, they were met with warning shots before being arrested.\n\nBut the facilities have fallen into disuse, and it will take several years for the base to be comprehensively modernised and renovated. According to the military officers\u2019 trade union, the underground command centre will not be fully equipped until 2021 or 2022.", "description": "Cavernous docks can shelter warships, with miles of tunnels, offices, and a hospital", "authors": ["David Crouch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f314a191955c64870403aa7a7e6040aacf3796/0_135_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3edb4b3bb4d94b24257f772ba3f02064", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
