Tsang believes that any parallels are more technical than political.\n\nIn both cases, there are claims of autonomy and independence but protesters in Hong Kong are not calling for the same thing as those in Catalonia, he said.\n\n\"They (Hong Kong protesters) are not asking for self-determination \u2014 they have simply asked the Chinese Government to maintain an agreement so that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy,\" Tsang added.\n\nDemonstrators in Catalonia want self-determination, which could potentially lead to independence.\n\nHe also added that protesters in Hong Kong are dealing with \"a very hard authoritarian regime, without any democratic responsibility,\" but that in Catalonia, even though demonstrators \"see many problems with the government, the government of Spain is democratically elected.\"\n\nIn Barcelona, emergency services were called out to treat 13 people throughout the day, although none had serious injuries.\n\nAccording to Tsang, protesters in Hong Kong, like those in Catalonia, have argued they acted peacefully and that if they became violent it was because of police presence and reactions.\n\nHow were protests organised in Catalonia?\n\n\"We will find out who is behind the Democratic Tsunami,\" Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said, adding his department was already investigating the movement.\n\nThe group, which uses social networks to get instructions to its followers, emerged on September 2.\n\nIt used Twitter to call on its supporters to use \"civil disobedience\" and \"non-violent actions\" in response to the upcoming court ruling.\n\nDemocratic Tsunami does not have visible spokespeople or leaders, a feature it shares with the Committees for the Defense of the Republic (CDR) \u2014 a web of committees whose initial function was to facilitate the Catalan independence referendum.\n\nHowever, unlike the CDR, the movement does not function via decentralised groups, but rather as a network that works to develop strategies.", "description": "\"Tsunami Democratic comes from the Catalan tradition of nonviolent resistance but, obviously, we have learned from other similar movements,\" the organizers of the protests at Barcelona airport told Euronews.", "authors": ["Marta Rodriguez Martinez"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/79/30/1000x563_cmsv2_f8af0106-fe9e-5b5b-8915-cce38f7fe71c-4237930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
