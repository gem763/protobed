So, they want to stabilise the party, that is precisely the point.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said she was welcome to run.\n\n\u201cWe are a democratic organisation, so members are free to nominate whoever they think their nominee should be.\u201d\n\nThe DA has announced on Friday afternoon that the nominations for the federal executive had closed.\n\nZille will be up against Athol Trollip, Thomas Walters and Mike Waters.\n\nFUTURE OF THE DA\n\nHelen Zille\u2019s decision to run for the Democratic Alliance\u2019s (DA) Federal Council chair position appears to have thrown a spanner in the works in the political battle unfolding within the party.\n\nSeveral party leaders that Eyewitness News spoke to said that while they knew Zille was plotting a political comeback, they didn\u2019t see it coming.\n\nZille\u2019s decision to re-enter direct politics is arguably not coincidental, as it comes when her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mmusi Maimane fights for his political life amid scandals involving a Steinhoff-sponsored car he used and a house he is accused of renting from a benefactor.\n\nMaimane told EWN this week that this is an attack on his integrity by his colleagues who were against diversity in the party and who wanted to reclaim what he called \u201cthe old DA\u201d.\n\nQuestions are now being raised if Zille\u2019s return is part of this project.\n\nOn Friday, she said she was coming back because she wanted to \u201cget the party back on track\u201d.\n\nThe question now is whether getting the party back on track includes getting rid of Maimane; and if she is appointed federal chair, how is she going to work with the DA leader when she doesn\u2019t seem to have confidence in him anymore, while he no longer regards her as a mentor.\n\nMAIMANE CLEARED OF ALL WRONGDOING\n\nThe DA has cleared its leader of any financial wrongdoing regarding the Steinhof-sponsored car he used and the house he is currently renting.\n\nThe party\u2019s finance committee initiated an investigation at the request of Maimane after he was accused of having insisted on using the car even after the company\u2019s fraud scandal was exposed.\n\nThere were also claims that he wasn\u2019t paying a market-related lease for the house he currently stays in.\n\nFinance committee chair Dion Geroge said he concluded that there was a delay in returning the car to Steinhoff (JO: ) because Maimane was on an international trip to the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Zille Claims She\u2019s Backed By Those Who Want To \u2018Heal\u2019 The DA appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Zille Claims She\u2019s Backed By Those Who Want To \u2018Heal\u2019 The DA", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/news_six_pile_69x52._800x533_L_1419494215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
