The triple world champion had been at Mercedes since 2012 and played a key role in bringing Hamilton to the team.\n\nNiki Lauda was a key influence in persuading Lewis Hamilton to join Mercedes back in 2013\n\nHamilton received advice from Lauda on the paddock and has won five titles at Mercedes\n\nThe Mercedes garage celebrate their sixth consecutive constructors' World Championship\n\n'I wouldn't say I am as happy as after winning the previous championships,' said Hamilton.\n\n'We lost Niki this year and it doesn't feel the same without him. It has been a tough year for us.\n\n'But I know he would take off his hat for today's result. We owe him a huge amount and this win is for him. The whole team at Mercedes would dedicate this to Niki. I definitely do.\n\n'Every time I walk into the garage we see Niki's headphones and his cap. I looked at it today before I got in the car. I know he will be proud, and so will his family. This team should be proud, too.'\n\nHamilton wore a cap in tribute to Lauda after winning the Monaco Grand Prix in May\n\nHamilton's boss Toto Wolff said: 'We want to dedicate this to Niki because he's been such an important part from the beginning of the journey and his sheer presence was always so important. He was a very special person.'\n\nHamilton will win his sixth championship a week on Sunday in Mexico City if he takes the chequered flag and team-mate Bottas finishes fifth or lower.\n\nBut the Mercedes cars have struggled at the high-altitude venue in recent seasons, and Hamilton fears he will have to wait for a title, which will move him to within one of Michael Schumacher's record.\n\nThe US Grand Prix follows the round in Mexico before the season's final races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.\n\nHamilton, 34, added: 'For me it has never been a case of wanting to rush things.\n\nAt Suzuka on Sunday, Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas came home in first place\n\n'Valtteri has driven well all year long, and done well today, and he will most likely do a very solid job over the next few races. So we still have a battle and the fight continues.\n\n'Mexico is our Achilles heel, our worst race of the year, so it is going to be a tough one for us. The last few have been pretty shocking.\n\n'It going to be very hard to beat Ferrari there. I don't anticipate it will be Mexico where I win it the title.'", "description": "Mercedes clinched the title and with Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas the only men left in the running for the drivers' championship, they will become the first team to win six consecutive crowns.", "authors": ["Philip Duncan", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/08/19680056-0-image-a-31_1571037258466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
