The performances take place in the hotel\u2019s lounge, an intimate and comfortable room that, for better or worse, serves as a way station between the lobby and the restaurant.\n\n\u201cMy idea is we\u2019re not just wallpaper here,\u201d says Dvoskin, a classically trained bassist with a degree from Moscow\u2019s venerable Gnessin Russian Academy of Music. \u201cThe musicians I play with, they\u2019re improvising, they really create every time they play their music. Not every gig has musicians where it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe acoustic bass is an ungainly instrument, large and bulky, and almost always taller than the man or woman who plays it. It\u2019s the undercarriage of a jazz tune, propelling it forward rhythmically while creating a sort of frame around the music at the same time. The beauty of the Tabard\u2019s duo setting is that the bass becomes an equal player, with a far more complex interplay between instruments than one usually finds at a hotel gig.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your typical \u2018I\u2019ll walk the baseline for you while you solo.\u2019 It\u2019s more constant communication,\u201d notes Geoffrey Reecer, a member of the Air Force\u2019s Airmen of Note, and one of three regular guitarists who play with Dvoskin. Adds pianist and occasional guest Harry Appelman, \u201cHis intonation, his soloing, the way he gets around the instrument \u2014 there\u2019s a certain classical technique there.\u201d\n\nTwenty-two years and counting at the same spot in D.C.\u2019s mercurial nightlife scene \u2014 still with no cover charge or minimum \u2014 is not an insignificant achievement, a throwback to an era when live jazz could be heard almost every night at most major hotels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was a plethora of places, both big and small in D.C., and everywhere there used to be music: the Mayflower, the Willard, the bigger chains like the Ritz or the Sheraton and the Four Seasons,\u201d says guitarist Donato Soviero, another Dvoskin regular. \u201cBut the day 9/11 hit, almost everywhere, the music was put on hold. And it never really picked up again,\u201d he adds, noting that the digital music revolution also kicked in around that time, and hotels realized they could program their own musical choices for next to nothing in costs.\u201d\n\nDvoskin\u2019s Sunday night concert at the Tabard usually attracts at least a handful of regular listeners, people who drop in to hear him and his guest play some of jazz\u2019s more challenging tunes: pieces by Bill Evans, Wayne Shorter, Jim Hall, Kenny Wheeler and Clifford Brown, for example. But there\u2019s also a good chance there will be some in the audience who will treat the music as nothing more than background noise. Yet, says Dvoskin, who talks very little during the 2\u00bd hour show, \u201cwhen the music goes from heart to heart, even people who don\u2019t have sharp ears or musical training, sooner or later they stop talking and realize something is going on here.\u201d\n\nDvoskin went on the road as a professional bassist starting in 1966, when he was 18, crisscrossing the Soviet Union several times and playing in all its 15 republics. Even though the Cold War was in full swing, jazz was no longer considered a bourgeois decadence but an art form, and the music was performed almost exclusively in concert halls. As one of the top jazz bassists in the former Soviet Union, Dvoskin spent 10 years with the Soviet jazz band Allegro, whose performances can be seen on YouTube.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, there was little jazz available on the Soviet Union\u2019s official record label, Melodiya; Dvoskin and others heard their jazz on Willis Conover\u2019s Jazz Hour on the Voice of America and through any other sources they could find.\n\n\u201cI had a friend whose father worked in the Trade Ministry, and he\u2019d bring back a couple of Monk records when he traveled,\u201d says Dvoskin, referring to the jazz innovator and pianist Thelonious Monk. Another friend, whose mother worked for the Italian Communist Party, lived in Moscow but traveled frequently to Italy and had a \u201chuge collection of Duke Ellington and Barbra Streisand,\u201d Dvoskin recalls, laughing at the memory.\n\nIn 1988, Dvoskin and three other Soviet musicians arrived in Washington as part of a local effort to form a sister-city relationship with Moscow. Instrumental in that drive was Fritzi Cohen, the co-owner, along with her husband Edward, of the Tabard Inn. Fritzi Cohen shepherded Dvoskin around town for several days and kept in touch. In 1997, she offered Dvoskin a job. Now the matriarch of the Tabard Inn, as she calls herself, she still comes in to see Dvoskin perform when she\u2019s in town.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cVictor, what about my favorite song,\u201d she called out during a recent Sunday evening, and Dvoskin, playing his solo with a bow rather than pizzicato, and Reecer, the guitarist, work their way through \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first they thought it was very pedestrian,\u201d Cohen says to a visitor about the tune. \u201cBut everyone loves it.\u201d\n\nIf you go\n\nVictor Dvoskin\n\nSundays from 7 to 9:30 p.m. at the Tabard Inn, 1739 N St. NW. tabardinn.com. Free.\n\nDvoskin will be joined by chromatic harmonica player Hendrik Meurkens on Oct. 20.\n\nAD", "description": "Bassist Victor Dvoskin has been performing on Sunday night at the Tabard Inn for over two decades.", "authors": ["T.R.
