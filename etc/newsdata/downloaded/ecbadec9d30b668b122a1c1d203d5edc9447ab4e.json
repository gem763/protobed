In light of those sums, the states contend, the Sacklers\u2019 proposed $3 billion contribution to the settlement is not enough.\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers want the bankruptcy court to stop our lawsuits so they can keep the billions of dollars they pocketed from OxyContin and walk away without ever being held accountable. That\u2019s unacceptable,\u2019\u2019 Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nThe claim that the Sacklers took up to $13 billion out of Purdue Pharma is contained in a transcript of a deposition that was taken late last month of one of Purdue\u2019s business advisers, Jesse DelConte, a director at consulting firm AlixPartners. DelConte, who referred to financial information he had reviewed while doing work for Purdue, did not provide in his deposition a time frame for those withdrawals.\n\nAD\n\nPurdue Pharma, drugmaker accused of fueling the opioid epidemic, files for bankruptcy\n\nMassachusetts has previously said in court filings, based on its analysis of Purdue financial records, that the family took $4 billion out of Purdue from 2008 to 2016. Oregon, based on its own analysis of Purdue records, has said the number is up to $11 billion from 2008 to 2018.\n\n\u201cThe Sackler family is trying to take advantage of the fact that they\u2019ve extracted nearly all the money out of Purdue and pushed the carcass of the company into bankruptcy,\u2019\u2019 said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable. Multibillionaires are the opposite of bankrupt.\u2019\u2019\n\nAD\n\nTwenty-four states have signed on to the tentative bankruptcy settlement. The family has argued in court filings that its withdrawals from Purdue were not intended to shield the money from litigation.\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers have agreed to relinquish their equity in Purdue and to contribute at least an additional $3 billion to the fight against the opioid crisis,\u2019\u2019 Daniel S. Connolly, an attorney for the branch of the Sackler family that includes its former chairman and president, Richard Sackler, said in a statement released Friday in response to the states\u2019 motion. \u201cThe stay, if granted, will allow parties to focus their efforts on this goal rather than on litigation that will waste resources and delay the deployment of solutions to communities in need.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSacklers could hold on to most of personal fortune in proposed Purdue Pharma settlement\n\nPurdue Pharma introduced OxyContin in 1996, and sales represented a small fraction of total prescription opioid sales. But numerous states and local governments contend the company\u2019s aggressive marketing of the drug, combined with its highly addictive nature, fueled a U.S. opioid epidemic that spread from prescription opioids to illegal fentanyl and heroin and claimed 400,000 lives. Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal criminal charges of misleading doctors about its addictive properties. In 2010, Purdue introduced an abuse-deterrent pill that made it impossible for addicts to crush and snort or inject.\n\nAD\n\nPlaintiffs who have filed a wave of lawsuits in the past two years claim Purdue Pharma, under the direction of the Sacklers, continued to mislead doctors and the public even after the guilty pleas.\n\nPurdue Pharma bankruptcy plan includes special protection for Sackler family fortune\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically are given an automatic stay of litigation. The attorneys general argued Friday that because they are exercising their state \u201cpolice powers,\u2019\u2019 Purdue Pharma is not entitled to an automatic stay.\n\nAD\n\nThat question, as well as the request to allow litigation to proceed against the Sacklers, will be decided by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain.\n\nPurdue Pharma has suggested in court filings that protecting the family from lawsuits is a vital component of the settlement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf forced to bear the risk of adverse money judgments, the related parties may be unwilling \u2014 or unable \u2014 to make the billions of dollars of contributions contemplated by the settlement structure,\u2019\u2019 Purdue said in a filing last month.\n\nPurdue Pharma issued a statement Friday that did not mention the Sackler family. It said the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing, and a halt to litigation, was necessary to allow the settlement to proceed.\n\nIn addition to contributing $3 billion over seven years, derived in part from an overseas drug company still owned by the Sacklers, the family has pledged to relinquish ownership of Purdue Pharma. As part of the deal, it would be set up as a public trust. Proceeds from continued opioid sales would be used to manufacture and distribute addiction and rescue antidote drugs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPurdue Pharma reaches tentative settlement in OxyContin lawsuits\n\n\u201cPurdue\u2019s request for a stay cannot be construed as an effort by the company to use the bankruptcy to evade responsibility or oversight,\u2019\u2019 the company said. \u201cTo the contrary, the settlement structure already offers 100 percent of Purdue without the plaintiffs having to win a single court case. So, bankruptcy is being used to give Purdue to its claimants, not to shield the company from them.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt added the settlement was a much better outcome for plaintiffs than the expenditure of Purdue Pharma money on hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees.\n\n\u201cThe burden of proof should be on those who insist on litigation over real solutions,\u2019\u2019 the company said in its statement.\n\nAD", "description": "Filings ask bankruptcy court to deny Purdue Pharma\u2019s request for stay of litigation.", "authors": ["Christopher Rowland", "Business Reporter Focused On The Health-Care Economy'S Effects On Patient Health", "Costs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oWTg4kNBm26081OHL2AmWnZsceQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H3BVGXHG5II6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
