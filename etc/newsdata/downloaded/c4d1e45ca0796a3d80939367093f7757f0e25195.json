Five days later, 293 lawmakers supported the motion and 46 members voted against.\n\nA one-line bill\n\nMr Johnson can bypasses the legal restrictions by passing a one-line act of parliament.\n\nThis could state that parliament had decreed that an election will take place on a certain date, and would need to be approved by a simple majority of lawmakers.\n\nBut this procedure has problems. For example, opposition parties have indicated they may try to amend the legislation, perhaps by reducing the voting age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo confidence\n\nAn election can also happen if a no confidence motion is carried in parliament. This triggers a 14-day period during which others can seek to form a new government by a vote of confidence.\n\nIf no-one can show they have majority support in parliament, an election is called.\n\nBecause Johnson is himself arguing for an election, this route is not expected to be the trigger for a vote.\n\nWho decides when the election is held?\n\nBoris Johnson.\n\nThere are legal restrictions setting out a minimum period before an election can take place after it has been called, but not on the maximum period before one needs to be held.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law states there must be 25 working days between an election being formally called and polling day, which is traditionally a Thursday.\n\nWhat are the obstacles to an early election?\n\nJohnson will need cross-party support for an early poll. The Labour Party has so far refused to back an election while there is a risk of Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement.\n\nEven if Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, supports an election, there is a risk Labour lawmakers who fear losing their seats may ignore his instruction and vote against the motion.\n\nReuters", "description": "Boris Johnson wants a British election on December 12.
