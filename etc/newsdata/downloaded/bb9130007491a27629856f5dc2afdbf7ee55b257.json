When you\u2019re in a wider game, you can always bring it in,\u201d Wilkinson told reporters.\n\nThe Springboks are \u201ca very smothering team. They can really get around you and make you feel like the pitch is tiny. Make you feel like there\u2019s about 20 of them\u201d, he said.\n\nAt the same time, they are \u201cenormously explosive\u201d and capitalise very quickly on any errors, so England will have to cut out mistakes, advised Wilkinson.\n\nIn South Africa\u2019s 19-16 win against Wales, fly-half Handre Pollard had a flawless goal-kicking record, scoring 14 of the points including a nerve-shredding penalty with only five minutes to go.\n\n\u201cThey need to maintain their discipline hugely because there is a goal-kicker in their team who punishes,\u201d said Wilkinson, who holds the record for most points scored in World Cups.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Very, very close\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnother member of that 2003 World Cup-winning side, Lawrence Dallaglio, said England\u2019s 19-7 win against the All Blacks in the semi-final was \u201cone of the great Rugby World Cup performances. Full stop\u201d.\n\nIf England win the World Cup, they will have beaten the three major southern hemisphere teams \u2014 Australia, New Zealand and South Africa \u2014 on consecutive weekends, which Dallaglio said would be the \u201cultimate\u201d achievement.\n\n\u201cObviously, given what England did to New Zealand, they will be favourites\u2026 but it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d predicted Dallaglio, the only person in the 2003 team who played every minute of that World Cup campaign.\n\nHowever, he pointed to the Springboks\u2019 impressive defensive record \u2014 they have conceded only four tries, and two of those were within the space of five minutes against the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa have proved that they are a very difficult side to beat. They are a tough nut to crack and they are pretty determined as well,\u201d said Dallaglio.\n\nAnother person who has lifted the Webb Ellis Cup, South Africa\u2019s Bryan Habana, predicted an \u201cepic\u201d final that would be decided by \u201cvery small margins\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy heart would definitely be with South Africa,\u201d said Habana, the star of South Africa\u2019s win in 2007, when asked to predict who will come out on top.\n\n\u201cMy head says that if South Africa can utilise their opportunities \u2014 potentially like the first 20 minutes they played against New Zealand at the beginning of the tournament \u2014 they realistically stand a chance of winning the game.\u201d\n\nWilkinson, Dallaglio and Habana had joined other former rugby greats such as Australia\u2019s George Gregan and England\u2019s Will Greenwood to coach Japanese children \u2014 part of World Rugby\u2019s efforts to spread the game during Asia\u2019s first World Cup.\n\nAnd the great fly-half had a simple answer when asked how Saturday\u2019s final would go.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my prediction? I am English, I work with the England team. England will win but I think it will be very, very close.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England\u2019s legendary World Cup-winner Jonny Wilkinson has warned against getting embroiled in a tight \u201carm-wrestle\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/ae9bb9_jonny-wilkinson-warned-an-arm-wrestle-south-africans-don-arm-wrestle-boks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
