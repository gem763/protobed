REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\n\nThe currencies, both viewed as safe havens, and the U.S. dollar had dropped sharply on Friday as optimism over the trade talks, together with the European Union and Britain restarting Brexit negotiations, encouraged investors into riskier assets.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Washington and Beijing had reached a \u2018Phase 1\u2019 trade deal.\n\nBut on Monday the mood was more cautious in an otherwise quiet start to the week for FX markets.\n\nAnalysts said the partial deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies appeared to lack substance with limited progress on structural issues such as technology transfers.\n\nManuel Oliveri, an analyst at Credit Agricole, said the announcements so far did not amount to \u201ca broad-based trade deal\u201d that would justify last week\u2019s market optimism.\n\nThe yen rose 0.3% on Monday, away from Friday's 2-1/2 month low, and was last at 108.15 per dollar JPY=EBS.\n\nThe euro fell 0.2% to $1.1014 EUR=EBS before recovering, while the dollar rose 0.1 % against a basket of currencies to 98.391 .DXY.\n\nThe Swiss franc rallied 0.2% against the euro to 1.0985 francs EURCHF=EBS.\n\nWith Tokyo\u2019s market closed for a public holiday and a holiday in the United States for Columbus Day, trading volumes will likely remain lighter than usual.\n\nThere was also little in the way of new key economic data due on Monday.\n\nEmerging market currencies and those closely linked to broad risk sentiment, such as the Australian dollar and Swedish crown, had rallied at the end of last week.\n\nOn Monday most were lower, with the Aussie losing 0.3% to $0.6770 AUD=D3 and the crown weakening 0.3% against the euro to 10.847 EURSEK=D3.\n\n\u201cWhile the tentative US-China mini deal is non-negative for markets \u2014 and in part exceeded the previously low market expectations \u2014 it in our view does not offer a durable solution to the trade conflict,\u201d ING strategists said in a research note.\n\nSterling dropped against both the dollar and euro GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 after Britain and the EU stressed over the weekend that there was a long way to go before they could agree a Brexit deal.\n\nThe pound was last down 0.7% at $1.2568 GBP=D3 but still almost 4 cents above its level last Wednesday. Sterling surged late last week after London and Brussels announced \"intense\" negotiations to try and agree a Brexit deal before Oct. 31.", "description": "The Swiss franc and Japanese yen rose on Monday as investors headed into safer assets, becoming more cautious that progress was being made toward a comprehensive trade deal between the United States and China.", "authors": ["Tommy Wilkes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440689701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0UP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
