We get excited about a face mask that makes your skin glow like a glazed doughnut or a dandruff-destroying, scalp massaging brush, and we obsess over Rio\u2019s latest discoveries. And we want to talk about it with our equally obsessed readers \u2014 so we started The Beauty of It All, our Facebook group with The Cut, where members swap notes on new products and discuss old favorites, debate some of the trickier beauty questions (Can you use retinol with P50? Should you tell someone her lipstick is smudged?), and talk about their all-time favorite desert-island products. You can join the group here, but in the meantime, we want to highlight some of our readers\u2019 sage advice. This week, we\u2019re tuning into their conversation about under-eye retinols.\n\nUnder-Eye Retinols\n\nRecently, a Beauty of It All member posed a question: Does anyone suggest using retinol under the eye area? The question sparked a conversation about the well known anti-aging ingredient, which can help smooth lines and increase cell turnover, but is also known for its potentially irritating properties. While dermatologists say it\u2019s safe to use retinol as an under-eye cream, the group weighed in with the recommendations they like to use on the sensitive area. Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nDr. Dennis Gross Skincare Ferulic + Retinol Triple Correction Eye Serum A couple of members sang the praises of Dr. Dennis Gross\u2019s retinol eye serum. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Ferulic + Retinol Triple Correction Eye Serum,\u201d one person commented. \u201cIt\u2019s pricey but a little goes a long way.\u201d Another fan writes, \u201cThe Dr. Gross Serum has never irritated my eyes and I use it two times per day.\u201d She also notes that you can use it on your eyelids. We\u2019re fans of the brand, too \u2014 Rio once raved about Dr. Dennis Gross\u2019s zit-arresting SpotLite, and we just heard from comedian Jacqueline Novak about the brand\u2019s Daily Peel skin-care pads, which she says she likes because \u201cthey feel dermish versus like, some nonsense.\u201d We get a similar vibe from the eye serum. $69 at Sephora Buy\n\nTrish McEvoy Beauty Booster\u00ae Retinol Eye Cream Another retinol eye cream that came up in the group was Trish McEvoy\u2019s Beauty Booster formulation: \u201cUse retinol eye cream because it\u2019s formulated for that area,\u201d suggests one commenter. \u201cTrish McEvoy makes a great one.\u201d This eye cream has dermatologist-approved ingredient hyaluronic acid, and is ophthalmologist tested, so you can rest assured it\u2019s alright to use by your eyes. $126 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nRoC Retinol Correxion Anti-Aging Eye Cream Those who prefer a drugstore option might like this RoC eye cream, which one commenter wrote was a recommendation from her dermatologist. \u201cMy derm recommended the RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream as an alt to the $80 one he carries in his office,\u201d she says. Like the Trish McEvoy cream (but a lot less expensive), it\u2019s ophthalmologist-tested, and also hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic, which makes us think even those with more sensitive skin could give it a try. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Drunk Elephant A-Passioni\u2122 Retinol Cream For those looking for something more natural, one member says, \u201cDrunk Elephant makes a great non-toxic retinol.\u201d We\u2019re fans of the culty brand, too, which the Cut has written about, covering some of their other moisturizers and balms. $74 at Sephora Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG Another member suggested a (very affordable) retinol alternative from the Ordinary. \u201cI love their caffeine eye treatment,\u201d writes one reviewer. One writer over at the Cut loved it, too. \u201cPreviously, I used Fresh Black Tea Age-Delay Eye Concentrate, but the Ordinary\u2019s Caffeine Solution is the first eye-specific product I\u2019ve ever used that actually seems to work; my eye area is less puffy and the skin tone is more even after a couple weeks of use,\u201d she says. $7 at Sephora Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
