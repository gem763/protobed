This will be followed by other steps like stopping the entry of trucks and closing brick kilns and stone crushers in and around the region.\n\nBCCL/ FILE\n\nThe odd-even traffic restrictions for private vehicles will also come into force next month.\n\nEven with all these restrictions in place, the air quality in and around Delhi is expected to plummet to severe levels later this months, during the Diwali season.", "description": "Even before the onset of winter the air quality in Delhi and the national capital region has begun showing signs of deterioration.
