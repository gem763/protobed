Why? \u2013> Whales are NOT accumulating #ETH as they are with #bitcoin,\u201d they explained.\n\nCan you tell the difference between our last tweet and this one?#ETH has fallen 25% on the last 7 days Vs the 21% drop of #BTC Why? \u2013> Whales are NOT accumulating #ETH as they are with #bitcoin Join us at https://t.co/RPXjIXG5Vh and do the same analysis!#realanalytics pic.twitter.com/26b4lv3VcV \u2014 intotheblock (@intotheblock) September 27, 2019\n\nWhile considering this data, it is imperative to note that Ethereum may not fare well compared to Bitcoin if the markets continue to drop, as the lack of massive buyers holding ETH may make its price more prone to major volatility.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Ethereum is down significantly from its recent highs, and one piece of on-chain data may spell significant trouble for ETH's long-term price action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_687484741-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
