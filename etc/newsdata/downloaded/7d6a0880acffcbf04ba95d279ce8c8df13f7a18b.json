The complainant fell to the floor and the defendant was on top punching her to the face.\n\n'Safari was screaming for help whilst the defendant continued to hit her to the face and pull her hair.\n\n'Both parties are separated and police attended and restrained the defendant at this point she starts to dig her large fingernails into them in an attempt to scratch them and she flailing her arms around.\n\n'She continued to scream and shout and was repeatedly swearing and was rolled onto her side prevented any lashing out.\n\n'The officers then put her back on her front to avoid any further injury although she is still struggling.\n\nMiss Paton walked away but was grabbed by the strap of her handbag by Katie Frost (pictured) before being pulled to the floor, punched in the head and pulled by the hair\n\n'They repeatedly told her to stop scratching but she said: 'Get the f*** of me you g** little c***'\n\n'At 4.25am these officers had to get assistance as were still struggling and she was still screaming.

All were filming her and jeering at her.\n\n'She had just found out that that the young man was sleeping with the victim and just picture this girl who had just turned 18 with all her problems and how bad she would have felt by that.\n\n'My client has expressed to me she apologised for being here and wishes not to be here again.'\n\nA probation report compiled about Frost read aloud at the hearing said: 'There seems to have been a history between both females in relation to Miss Frost and she found out her partner had been cheating with the victim.\n\n'She says people in street been shouting abuse at her and her daughter making her feel unwell mentally.\n\nVictim: Safari Leigh-Paton, 18, who was punched by love rival Katie Frost\n\n'On the night she had been out with friends and was on her own when she entered the service station.\n\n'She had consumed alcohol from between 6pm to 2am described herself as intoxicated and said the victim was staring at her and she tried to walk away.\n\n'She says the complainant approached her and said 'what you looking at?' and they began arguing about the cheating that had gone on.\n\n'She accepts she hit the complaint to the face and that she showed poor emotional management.\n\n'She was unable to manage her emotions both with police and the lady in question. She responded in a reckless and impulsive manner and didn't think about the consequences.\n\n'She presents as a vulnerable individual and is still in an on-off relationship with this gentleman.'\n\nFrost was also sentenced to a community order for 12 months and was ordered to complete 120 hours unpaid work.
