Maybe.\n\nVolocopter claims it\u2019s got the world\u2019s first manned, electric and vertical takeoff air taxis, Reuters reports, and has secured funding from companies such as Geely and Daimler. A concrete number hasn\u2019t been released, but Volocopter is said to have somewhere around 85 million euros (almost $136,949,907) in total capital.\n\nHere\u2019s more from the article:\n\nGeely\u2019s chairman Li Shufu said in the statement that the investment reflected how the Chinese company is transitioning to become a mobility technology group, investing in and developing a wide range of next-generation technologies. The co-operation underlines \u201cour confidence in Volocopter air taxis as the next ambitious step in our wider expansion in both electrification and new mobility services,\u201d Li said.\n\nThe Volocopter itself honestly looks pretty badass \u2014 it\u2019s like the future incarnate. I wouldn\u2019t mind actually seeing these doing their thing, especially given the fact that they\u2019re electrified and I guess hypothetically more sustainable than our standard taxis.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Geely\u2019s first time looking into the whole \u201cflying\u201d thing, either \u2014 company documents obtained by Reuters show the company is currently building a plant to make Terrafugia flying cars. Geely is obviously betting on flying being the mode of future transportation.\n\nThere is currently no set timeline for when we can expect flying taxis to actually take off in China, but with initial prototypes of the Volocopter already manufactured, the implication is that we\u2019ll see these bad boys in the next few years.\n\nWhich always seems to be the case. All this cool, futuristic tech is perpetually just \u201ca few years away.\u201d\n\nFlying transportation has been in the works for ages, and we\u2019re still not using it regularly. \u201cA few years away\u201d has turned into the code for \u201cwe definitely don\u2019t even have a timeline to get like five of these built, let alone actually getting them on the road.\u201d\n\nThat said, if anyone can make it happen, it\u2019d be Geely and Daimler. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.", "description": "Thanks to a partnership between Geely and German startup Volocopter, air taxis will apparently be coming to China in the near future so that we can live all of our Blade Runner hovercar dreams.
