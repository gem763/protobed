Japan's national rugby union team player walks through floodwater at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium in Tokyo\n\nBy Makiko Yamazaki and Kiyoshi Takenaka\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Two men were killed, about 60 people injured and more than six million people advised to evacuate as a powerful typhoon bore down on the Japanese capital on Saturday, bringing with it the heaviest rain and winds in 60 years.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which means \"speed\" in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan's main island of Honshu on Saturday evening, bursting some river banks and threatening to flood low-lying Tokyo as it coincides with high tide.\n\nThe storm, which the government warned could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular hot spring resort town of Hakone, with a whopping 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, including Tokyo, warning of amounts of rain that occur only once in decades.\n\n\"Damage from floods and landslides is likely taking place already,\" an agency official told a news conference carried by public broadcaster NHK. \"It is critical that people take action urgently to protect their lives and the lives of loved ones.\"\n\nMany people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities earlier on Saturday before the worst arrived.\n\nYuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community centre in Edogawa in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit.\n\nShe said she decided to move before it was too late.\n\n\"I've got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\" Ikemura said.\n\n\"We brought with us the bare necessities. I'm scared to think about when we will have run out diapers and milk,\" she told Reuters.\n\nVULNERABLE\n\nTokyo's Haneda airport and Narita airport in Chiba both stopped flights from landing and connecting trains were suspended, forcing the cancellation of more than a thousand flights, according to Japanese media.\n\nKanagawa prefecture said it was releasing water from the Shiroyama dam, southwest of Tokyo, as an emergency measure and alerted residents in areas along nearby rivers.\n\nHeavy winds have already caused some damage, particularly in Chiba east of Tokyo, where one of the strongest typhoons to hit Japan in recent years destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses a month ago.\n\nA man in his forties was killed in an overturned car in the prefecture early on Saturday. Another man died after a landslide destroyed two houses in a town in eastern Japan, with several still reported missing, according to NHK.\n\nA number of municipal governments issued evacuation orders to areas particularly at risk of floods and landslides, including some in the most populous Tokyo region.\n\nExperts warned that Tokyo, while long conditioned to prepare for earthquakes, was vulnerable to flooding, with about 1.5 million people living below sea level.\n\nMore than 150,000 households have lost power, including in Chiba, which was hit hard by typhoon Faxai a month ago, NHK said.\n\nThe Defence Ministry set up a new Twitter account to disseminate information on disaster relief efforts.\n\nStores, factories and subway systems have been shut down as a precaution, leaving Tokyo's usually bustling shopping and entertainment districts such as Shibuya and Ginza deserted.\n\nJapanese Formula One Grand Prix organisers cancelled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday. Two matches of the Rugby World Cup due to be played on Saturday were also cancelled.\n\nTyphoon Ida, known as the \"Kanogawa Typhoon\" in Japanese, killed more than 1,000 people in 1958.", "description": "Two killed as fierce typhoon hits Tokyo, millions told to evacuate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9B0AX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
