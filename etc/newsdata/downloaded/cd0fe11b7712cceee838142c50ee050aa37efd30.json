Sports Illustrated reported he repeatedly yelled toward a group of female reporters about closer Roberto Osuna, who was suspended for 75 games last year for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy before being traded from Toronto to the Astros.\n\nTaubman shouted \u201cThank God we got Osuna!\u201d according to SI, which said he made similar remarks several times, punctuating them with a profanity.\n\nManfred wasn\u2019t sure how long the investigation will need.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure you get all the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to be as thorough as you possibly can, understand the whole situation. But once you get there, you want to get it behind you.\u201d\n\nManfred said what occurred in the clubhouse was of more concern to him than the Astros\u2019 response, which was initially to call the SI report \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible.\u201d The team said SI had tried to \u201cfabricate a story where one does not exist\u201d and maintained Taubman\u2019s comments weren\u2019t directed at reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really concerned at this point about the underlying substance of the situation and what the atmosphere was, how it came to be,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cWe pride ourselves on providing an inclusive, harassment free environment in all of the various aspects of our business. I think it\u2019s a core value for baseball. And I think that we have to be tremendously concerned whenever we have an incident that attracts this much attention.\u201d\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch said Tuesday that \u201cwe all need to be better across the board, in the industry\u201d and repeated his concern before Game 2.\n\n\u201cI feel responsible for the clubhouse. I feel responsible for everything that goes on down here,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cI consider myself a leader, so I felt like it was important for me to be visible and to give you my thoughts on a very important topic surrounding our clubhouse. I cherish this place. I cherish our players and everything that goes on. I was just being the manager of the club here down here in the clubhouse.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major League Baseball will speak with the Astros to determine whether the commissioner's office or the club will handle any decision following an investigation into the conduct of Houston assistant general manager Brandon Taubman.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/world_series_nationals_astros_baseball_04381_c0-215-5165-3227_s1200x700.jpg?b156e664abad691009dfaff66e876474f26cdea2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
