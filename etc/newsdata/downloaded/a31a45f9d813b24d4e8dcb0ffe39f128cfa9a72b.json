If we really think these things should be off the street, we need to destroy them,'\u201d Stack told CBS News\u2019 Lee Cowan.\n\nHe gave no further information about when or how the merchandise was destroyed.\n\nStack said that his decisions on how Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods should sell guns changed when mass shootings began to happen more frequently.\n\nAfter the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting in Newton, Conn., he said he ordered all the AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to be removed from all the stores across the country. He said this was done without any announcement from the company and that the company received some backlash.\n\n\u201cWe probably get a little bit of a backlash, but we didn\u2019t expect to get what we got,\u201d Stack said. \u201cAll this about, you know, how we were anti-Second Amendment, you know, \u2018we don\u2019t believe in the Constitution,\u2019 and none of that could be further from the truth. We just didn\u2019t want to sell the assault-style weapons that could inflict that kind of damage.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Fla., led to Stack making even stricter changes to the gun selling policy. He announced that firearms would no longer be sold to anyone under 21, a decision that he says led to the company losing \u201cabout a quarter of a billion\u201d dollars.\n\nStack also said that many stores have stopped selling firearms all together. Right now, he said guns have been removed from more than 100 Dick Sporting Good stores and he is considering to make this ban in all of the stores.\n\n\u201cSo many people say to me, you know, \u2018If we do what you want to do, it\u2019s not going to stop these mass shootings,'\u201d Stack told Cowan. \u201cAnd my response is, \u2018You\u2019re probably right, it won\u2019t. But if we do these things and it saves one life, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s worth it?'\u201d\n\nStack\u2019s new policy decisions received praise from Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke on Monday, who tweeted that the company is doing more to keep America safe from gun violence than Congress.\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "CEO Ed Stack said that his company has destroyed about $5 million worth of assault rifles from their inventory.", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/dicks-sporting-lawmakers-school-shooting.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
