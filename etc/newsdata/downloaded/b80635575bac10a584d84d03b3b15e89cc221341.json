(Ward LaForme Jr)\n\nHill said he just couldn't sit and watch so he made some phone calls.\n\nHe secured two jets, a Dassault Falcon 900 and a Challenger 850, which can carry about 1,133 kg worth of cargo each, donated by Ontario-based corporate charter airline Flightexec for the relief effort.\n\nA third cargo jet, a Falcon 20, was added to the fleet on Wednesday evening to deal with the large amount of donated supplies.\n\nThe jets will carry supplies ranging from canned foods and water to flashlights, clothes and generators, Hill said.\n\nHill said he is travelling with the supplies along with a team of volunteers, including carpenters and bricklayers, to help in the reconstruction.\n\nSeminole Tribe supplying helicopters\n\nThe jets have already secured landing slots with a corporate terminal in Nassau, according to a senior official with Flightexec.\n\nThere, he said, supplies would be unloaded and put onto two helicopters provided by the Seminole Tribe in Oklahoma and Florida.\n\nHill said the helicopters would ferry the supplies to the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama because the waters are still too rough to travel there by boat.\n\nThis aerial photo provided by Medic Corps, show the destruction brought by Hurricane Dorian on Man-o-War cay, Bahamas on Tuesday. (Medic Corps via AP)\n\nHill said one of the jets will remain in Nassau and conduct supply runs from the Florida mainland.\n\n\"Seeing the people, the little kids, the schools, and what they have gone through over the years, it hit home to me,\" he said.\n\n\"It's like life on the reservation. They are the less fortunate in their own country, like us, Native people. When it comes to those issues, the Montour family, the Hill family has always stepped up to the plate.\"\n\nWorkers load water into one of three jets being sent to the Bahamas as part of a relief effort coordinated by Six Nations businessman Ken Hill. (Nick Erb)\n\nHill is working through a charity he started with business partner Jerry Montour and others called the Dreamcatcher Foundation to help fund the relief effort.\n\nHill and Montour also founded Grand River Enterprises, the cigarette manufacturing behemoth with a global reach based out of Six Nations, a Haudenosaunee community about 30 km southwest of Hamilton.\n\n\"Everyone likes to do a lot of talking, but they don't want to step up,\" said Montour.\n\nMontour said Hill contacted him about the idea and he quickly agreed to back the plan to send supplies to the Bahamas.\n\nMontour said his biggest concern was ensuring they sent clean water.\n\n\"At the end of the day, one of the scariest things is not to have access to clean water,\" he said.\n\nGrand River Enterprises matching donations\n\nDelby Powless, chair of the Dreamcatcher Foundation, said private fundraising efforts to support the relief have hit about $200,000 so far \u2014matched dollar for dollar by Grand River Enterprises.\n\n\"It tears your heart out,\" said Powless.\n\n\"Think of losing everything.\"\n\nPowless said the shipments of water are coming from Wahta Natural Springs Water, a company in Wahta Mohawk territory that is owned by Grand River Enterprises.\n\nHe said supplies were also being purchased from places like Costco.\n\nVolunteers rescue several families from the rising waters of Hurricane Dorian, near the Causarina bridge in Freeport, Grand Bahama, Bahamas, Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019.

(Ramon Espinosa/The Associated Press)\n\nNick Erb, president of Flightexec, said the final decision to arrange the flights and transport aid to the Bahamas came at about 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nErb said he and Hill began discussing plans on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"At the time it was unclear whether it was too soon,\" he said.\n\n\"This morning we decided it's a go\u2026. And we had our partners down there doing scouting flights and giving us intelligence on what would be feasible.\"\n\nErb said his company does a lot of work in the Caribbean and he's developed a lot of relationships in the region.\n\n\"It really hit home for us,\" he said.", "description": "A prominent First Nations businessman is leading a relief effort to help the hurricane-stricken Bahamas that will see three jets leave Hamilton Wednesday evening loaded with supplies.", "authors": ["Jorge Barrera Is A Caracas-Born", "Award-Winning Journalist Who Has Worked Across The Country", "Internationally.
