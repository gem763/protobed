He should be buried in a cave,\" Burombo told AFP.\n\n\"Mugabe was not just a president, but he was the embodiment of the spirit of Kaguvi,\" he added, referring to one of Zimbabwe's revered spirit mediums and pre-colonial nationalist leader.\n\nWhen a chief died, often his body \"would be dried\", his teeth \"extracted\" and his fingernails and toenails \"ripped off\", Burombo said.\n\nHe said the body would then be wrapped in skin hides before burial, and could even be swapped with a token such as a goat's head to be buried instead.\n\n\"You can build that monument, but it doesn't mean that is where the remains of Mugabe will be buried... it's just for people to continue remembering him.\"\n\nMugabe grew up Catholic and was educated by Jesuits. But according to Burombo, he still followed \"traditional norms and practices\" despite \"going to church\".\n\nExaggerating the mystery\n\nMugabe's remains currently lie in his childhood village of Kutama, in Zvimba district, about 90km west of Harare.\n\nDuring a mass held in his honour, priest Emmanuel Ribeiro \u2013 a former acquaintance \u2013 said the former president \"was secretive and private\" about his beliefs.\n\nRetired sociology professor Claude Mararike told AFP the secrecy surrounding the funerals of traditional chiefs had \"long vanished\".\n\nHe said that in the past, a death would only be revealed days or even weeks after burial.\n\n\"Very few people knew where the chief was buried,\" Mararike said. \"There were caves where a particular clan normally buried their own chiefs.\"\n\nBut Mararike said that long-standing political tensions between the family and government \"might have precipitated\" the discord and mystery surrounding the funeral.\n\nMugabe's family are still bitter over the role current President Emmerson Mnangagwa played in his ouster.\n\nA former guerrilla who fought alongside Mugabe against colonial forces, Mnangagwa was fired as first vice president in 2017. Mugabe had branded him a \"traitor\".\n\nSoon after, protesters took to the streets and military officers pressured Mugabe to step down in what was widely seen as a struggle between Mnangagwa's faction and loyalists to Mugabe's wife Grace inside the ruling ZANU-PF party.\n\n\"There obviously was quite a lot of anger among the Zvimba people on how their son was removed from office,\" said Mararike.\n\n\"The late president Mugabe might have said something before he died,\" he added referring to how he wanted to be buried, \"but what he really said, we don't know\".", "description": "As public wakes for late Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe have drawn to a close, traditional chiefs are demanding the body be buried according to spiritual traditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1600/a71e62704a4145199af661789450524c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
