It also said a multi-billion dollar oil and gas project being carried out by state-owned Vietnam Oil & Gas Group and Exxon Mobil Corp. in block 118 of the waters would continue unimpeded.\n\n\u201cAny activities that hamper Vietnam\u2019s oil and gas exploration in Vietnamese water are violations of international laws,\u201d Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry, told reporters during a briefing on Thursday.\n\nThe Chinese-owned Haiyang Dizhi 8 has intermittently zigzagged across a Vietnam-demarcated block of water to study the seabed in an active drilling block operated by Russia\u2019s state-owned Rosneft Oil PJSC since early July. China claims most of the South China Sea with a map of a nine-dash line stretching far from the mainland, and has sought to negotiate one-on-one deals with countries in the region on sharing energy and fish resources.\n\nThe latest Vietnamese statements came after China scored diplomatic wins with other South China Sea claimants. On Monday, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi agreed with his Malaysian counterpart Saifuddin Abdullah on the establishment of a bilateral consultation mechanism to \u201cproperly handle\u201d disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nChina also appears to be making progress on a joint exploration deal with the Philippines, with President Rodrigo Duterte saying earlier this week he would ignore an international court ruling affirming his country\u2019s territorial claims in order to advance energy cooperation with Beijing. Duterte said the deal would entail a 60-40 revenue-sharing scheme favoring the Philippines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a full court press with China to push its nine-dash line, press foreign oil companies and pressure countries into joint development deals,\u201d said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia who has written about Southeast Asia security issues for more than two decades..\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen in Hanoi at uyen1@bloomberg.net;Peter Martin in Beijing at pmartin138@bloomberg.net;Philip J.
