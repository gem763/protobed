Add Interest\n\nMichael McKinley, a veteran diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Brazil, Afghanistan, Colombia, and Peru, is the sixth witness called by the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees as they investigate Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine to open corruption investigations for Trump\u2019s political benefit.\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nIt was unclear Wednesday morning if McKinley would show up. The State Department has ordered active officials not to appear before the committees, but two other former U.S officials have not been blocked from testifying: special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, who resigned after it was revealed how he facilitated Giuliani\u2019s effort, and Fiona Hill, the senior Russia official on Trump\u2019s National Security Council who departed days before Trump\u2019s controversial call with Ukraine\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nTwo current State Department officials were subpoenaed and complied, defying their order not to appear: former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, whose portfolio includes Ukraine and other Eastern European countries. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will comply with a subpoena and testify Thursday after not showing up last Tuesday.\n\nMcKinley stepped down as Pompeo\u2019s senior adviser Friday after serving as a key conduit to the Foreign Service, the U.S. diplomatic corps. In a farewell note to colleagues, McKinley said it was time to move on after 37 years, but his resignation comes amid anger and frustration over Pompeo\u2019s role in the Ukraine controversy.\n\nAs a close adviser, McKinley traveled often with Pompeo during Pompeo's year and a half as Secretary of State, returning to Washington from Brasilia just weeks after Pompeo was sworn in. His guidance was important to Pompeo who worked to restore trust among career diplomats after his predecessor Rex Tillerson was seen as destroying their ranks with budget cuts, a costly, unpopular department redesign, and a freeze on hiring family members to work at missions overseas.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear how much McKinley knew about Giuliani\u2019s efforts and how they were aided by Sondland and Volker; the department\u2019s attempts to dispel a smear campaign against Yovanovitch by Giuliani, his associates, and corrupt Ukrainian politicians; or the hold on $392 million of security assistance to Ukraine from the State Department and Pentagon.\n\nMcKinkey is not included in internal emails given to Congress by the State Department inspector general and obtained by ABC News, where officials like Kent are seen countering a \u201cfake news driven smear\u201d campaign against Yovanovitch. But other senior advisers to Pompeo are included, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale, another well-respected ambassador and the department\u2019s highest-ranking career Foreign Service officer, as well as State Department counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, a West Point classmate and longtime friend of Pompeo.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s former senior adviser is scheduled to appear Wednesday before three House committees leading the impeachment probe of President Trump.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/mckinley-pompeo_hpMain_20191016-052117_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
