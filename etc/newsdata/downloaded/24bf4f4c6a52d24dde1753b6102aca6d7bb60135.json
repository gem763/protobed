(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\n\nVery soon, the Major League Baseball postseason will belong to the old-money bluebloods and the new-money tech giants \u2014 teams such as the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros, with their upper-quartile payrolls and starpower. For at least the next week or so, and perhaps deep into this month, they get the prime-time television slots, and everyone else plays in sunshine and long shadows.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, from the opening moments of the American League wild-card game at Oakland\u2019s RingCentral Coliseum, the national stage belonged to the Tampa Bay Rays, and if they were a revelation it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nWe will be seeing more of the Rays, October\u2019s ultimate underdogs, because a surprisingly easy 5-1 win over the Oakland Athletics in the wild card game sends them into the best-of-five Division Series with the Houston Astros, the top overall seed of the postseason. Game 1 will be Friday at Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park.\n\nIt was a win that fit well within the contours of baseball in 2019: five innings from their starting pitcher (Charlie Morton), a parade of hard-throwing relievers taking it from there, and all five runs scoring on homers \u2013 a pair of solo blasts from first baseman Yandy Diaz, a two-run shot by right fielder Avisail Garcia and a solo shot by designated hitter Tommy Pham.\n\nIf the Rays were easy to overlook in this year\u2019s 10-team postseason field, highlighted by four 100-win behemoths, it would be fitting. The Rays are always overlooked. But even if you believe they are destined to be annihilated by the Astros \u2014 and it says here they will give Houston a scare \u2014 they are worth a moment of admiration.\n\nThe Rays are making their first postseason appearance since 2013, but from 2008 to 13 they made it four times, with a World Series appearance in 2008. In going 96-66 this season, they reached the 90-win mark for the sixth time this decade. And they have done it without going through the sort of paralyzing, multi-year, full-scale rebuild that other successful, small- to mid-market teams have done.\n\nPerhaps more than any other team in the game \u2014 with the possible exception of the one they were matched against Wednesday night \u2014 the Rays epitomize the ideal of doing the most with the least. Their payroll this season, $63.1 million per Spotrac, was the smallest in the majors, and less than one-third that of the major-league-leading Boston Red Sox, whom the Rays beat by 12 games in the AL East this season.\n\n[15 most intriguing characters of the 2019 MLB playoffs]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing having the lowest payroll in baseball and having the success we did,\u201d center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, the Rays\u2019 highest-paid player at $8.17 million, said before the game. \u201cIt always feels good to stick it to the man any time you\u2019re able to in this game.\u201d\n\nMostly by necessity, the Rays are adept at drafting well, building through the farm system, identifying market inefficiencies and finding creative ways to gain small advantages. They are among the most aggressive defensive-shifters in the game, and on Wednesday night, against Oakland\u2019s Matt Olson, they put on such an extreme shift \u2014 with four full-depth outfielders and two infielders in the grass just beyond the infield dirt \u2014 it took ESPN\u2019s telecast several minutes to be able to position a camera to show it. Other than the pitcher and catcher, only first baseman Diaz was standing in the dirt.\n\nWhen the Rays spend on free agents, they can\u2019t afford to be wrong \u2014 and they were 100 percent right about Morton, the veteran right-hander they signed to a two-year $30 million deal this winter and who became one of the steals of the off-season when he went 16-6 with a 3.05 ERA for the Rays. A slam-dunk pick to start the biggest game to this point of the Rays\u2019 season, he delivered five sterling innings, allowing only an unearned run.\n\nDiaz, the Cuban first baseman who smashed two of the Rays\u2019 four homers, was an under-the-radar trade acquisition last December, at which point he had hit only one homer in 299 big-league plate appearances. But the Rays were attracted to him by his elite exit velocity \u2014 an average of 92.1 mph in 2018, one notch behind Mookie Betts and two behind Christian Yelich.\n\nThe Rays are as creative as any team in their deployment of pitching, popularizing the \u201copener\u201d in 2018 and regularly toggling arms between the rotation and bullpen. But Morton was so good Wednesday night, in an old-school sort of way, Rays Manager Kevin Cash rode him for five \u2014 and as anyone who has watched baseball lately knows, when it comes to starters\u2019 innings, especially in October, five is the new seven.\n\n[Every MLB playoff team\u2019s fatal flaw]\n\nCash only needed to dip three times into his well-stocked bullpen, getting six outs from Diego Castillo, four from Nick Anderson and the final two from Emilio Pagan to carry home the win \u2014 and leaving standout arms such as Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell untouched and presumably available for longer stints Friday in Houston.\n\nAs they depart the postseason stage \u2014 losing the wild card game for the second straight year \u2014 let\u2019s spare a moment of appreciation for the A\u2019s. With the 25th-highest payroll in the majors, they tied with the NL East champion Atlanta Braves for the fifth-most wins. Like the Rays, their small-revenue, small-payroll cousins, the A\u2019s have avoided undertaking a major rebuild, and have remained not only competitive \u2014 but consistently successful, with this postseason appearance their fifth in the past eight years.\n\nWinner-take-all wild-card games are inherently unfair, incongruous and grotesque \u2014 an intentional bastardization of the sport of baseball, which is designed to reward teams across the daily grind of 162 games and the four-week survivalist exercise of the postseason. A one-game playoff, in baseball, is little more than a glorified coin flip. Few would try to argue otherwise.\n\nBut for sheer spectacle and drama \u2014 and the biggest factor of all: television ratings \u2014 few things in baseball can rival these madcap, early October contests, which essentially compress a six-month marathon into a pair of frantic, nine-inning sprints.\n\nAt their best, they produce something like Tuesday night\u2019s classic, with the Washington Nationals beating the Milwaukee Brewers, 4-3, in the NL wild card game \u2014 with Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg \u201cpiggybacking\u201d the start, and a harrowing, luck-infused rally in the bottom of the eighth inning turning what looked like a certain loss into a thrilling win.\n\nAnd even at their worst, as when the Rays jumped the A\u2019s early Wednesday night and never let them back in, every pitch is infused with the inherent drama of two teams\u2019 seasons on the line.\n\nStarting the postseason with a pair of win-or-go-home games isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s idea of fairness \u2014 including, of course, the losing teams. Major League Baseball\u2019s standard answer to those complaints is: If you don\u2019t like the wild card game, win your division so you can avoid it.\n\nAnd whether you love the one-game wild card format or not, television loves it unconditionally -- which means it is here to stay.\n\nRead more on the MLB playoffs:\n\nMLB playoff bracket and schedule\n\nHow the Nationals match up with the top-seeded, very scary Dodgers\n\nBrewers rookie Trent Grisham says costly error in wild-card loss will \u2018sting for a long time\u2019\n\nHouston\u2019s mattress king bets $3.5 million on Astros to win World Series", "description": "Tampa Bay beat Oakland, 5-1, in AL wild-card game, scoring all five runs on homers.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer", "October At Pm", "Dave Sheinin Has Been A Washington Post Sports Writer Since Before Working At The Post", "He Covered Golf", "Florida Gators Football", "Major League Baseball For The Miami Herald."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wMFfDXtuT30pU3m3s0xDoAYh6wE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CJV3YXXFPAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
