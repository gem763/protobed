Marantz appears to be arguing against a colossal strawman in which there\u2019s never any talking before violence.\n\nBreaking news! People talk before they do things! And it\u2019s not always good!\n\nBecause of this allegedly paradigm-changing revelation, Marantz believes First Amendment values should be discarded.\n\nIt\u2019s not just violence. Marantz whines that the internet was once seen as \u201csurely only a force for progress\u201d but that \u201cNo one believes that anymore. Not after the social-media-fueled campaigns of Narendra Modi and Rodrigo Duterte and Donald Trump; not after the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, VA; not after the massacres in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, two mosques in Christchuch New Zealand, and a Walmart in a majority-Hispanic part of El Paso.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to feign shock at a New York Times writer equating the election of populist leaders with white supremacist massacres. That\u2019s just what the mainstream media does these days \u2014 and every time they do it, Americans contempt for the media sinks a little lower. Just 35 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of Republicans say information from national news organizations is \u201cvery trustworthy.\u201d\n\nAlso predictable is the writer\u2019s call for unelected tech executives to play speech-police: \u201cTomorrow, by fiat, Mark Zuckerberg could make Facebook slightly less profitable and enormously less immoral,\u201d writes Marantz. \u201cHe could hire thousands more content moderators and pay them fairly. Or he could replace Sheryl Sandberg with Susan Benesch, a human rights lawyer and an expert on how speech can lead to violence.\u201d\n\nMassacres and madmen have always existed. The Oklahoma City bombing happened before the internet had attained widespread use, as did (as the author ironically acknowledges himself) the Rwandan genocide. Anti-Semitic pamphleteers drove pogroms in Russia and parts of Europe at the turn of the 19th century. There\u2019s nothing about the internet that makes violence more likely than in previous eras, all of which were far more violent than modern times.\n\n\n\nThe test of Marantz\u2019s thesis is this: can speech alone, and in particular the digital erosion of the power of gatekeeping publishers to moderate the flow of information, kill people?\n\nWe can only think of one recent example: Alec Holowka, the video game designer who committed suicide after the notorious social justice grifter Zoe Quinn used social media to spread wildly exaggerated charges of abuse against him. Even with the media\u2019s far-left bias, it\u2019s unlikely that any major publication would have agreed to spread such threadbare allegations in the pre-digital era.\n\nIt\u2019s not a case against free speech, but it would be an interesting case for Marantz to discuss. Of course, he never will.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
