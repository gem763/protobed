Taylor and infielder Wilmer Difo before Tuesday\u2019s home game with the New York Mets. Both players had spent time with Washington earlier this year and both had been in the minors: Difo at Triple-A and Taylor at Double-A.\n\nTaylor hit .248 with 10 steals in 57 games for Harrisburg, which begins the playoffs Wednesday at Bowie.\n\nHe began the year with the Nationals and hit .211 in 43 games before going to Double-A.\n\n\u201cYou look at needs and stuff,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez told reporters earlier this week. \u201cFor me, moving forward, it\u2019d be nice to have a guy that you could count on to pinch-run or steal a base. But other than that, if you look at our team, we got guys that can do a bunch of different things.\u201d\n\nTaylor is a strong defender in center field who has struggled at the plate with strikeouts in the majors.\n\nDifo hit .300 in 61 games with Fresno, which ended its season Monday.\n\nThe Nationals (77-59) entered Tuesday 6 1/2 games back of first-place Atlanta in the National League East. But Washington had won 16 of its last 20 and held the top spot in the wild-card race.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
