In addition, he was one of the administration\u2019s \"three amigos\" on Ukrainian policy, along with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for the Ukraine conflict, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, as Sondland described their relationship in a July broadcast interview.\n\nIn Ukraine and other Eastern European countries, the former Texas governor often played the role of U.S. energy pitchman. He helped deliver a deal to export U.S. coal to Ukraine, and he cemented a natural gas deal with Poland that would send supplies to Ukraine and help reduce its dependence on Russian fuel.\n\nAmong Perry's numerous visits with Zelenksy and other Ukraine officials in the past year was a dinner with Zelensky, Trump\u2019s son-law-Jared Kushner and other officials in June, according to a government photo taken by the U.S. of the event. The two met again the following month with Polish government officials to sign the energy cooperation agreement, according to news releases.\n\nPerry also attended the bilateral meeting with Zelenksy and Trump in New York on Sept. 25, a DOE spokesperson confirmed.\n\nThe message from Perry to Zelensky, according to one person familiar with the discussions, was: \"You've got to take steps on your anti-corruption efforts.\u201d\n\nPerry also called for shaking up Naftogaz to help it cut its reliance on energy supplies from Russia and open itself up for more investment from the U.S., people familiar with the discussions told POLITICO.\n\nSpecifically, Perry pushed Naftogaz to expand its supervisory board \u2014 a three-person entity that now includes Amos Hochstein, a former Biden aide and State Department energy official currently working for the U.S. liquefied natural gas company Tellurian. The other two members are Bruno Lescoeur, a former executive in charge of international affairs at the French energy company Engie, and Clare Spottiswoode, director of London-based advisory Gas Strategies.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Bleyzer did not immediately reply to a message left with his firm.\n\nTwo clients of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Ukrainian-American Trump donors Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had met with Naftogaz earlier this year to pitch themselves as suppliers of U.S. natural gas, according to media reports.\n\n\u201cI may or may not know anything about it,\u201d Giuliani told POLITICO when asked if he knew about Perry\u2019s efforts to install new people on the board.\n\nPerry is scheduled to travel in Eastern Europe next week to follow up on a energy-cooperation agreement the U.S., Ukraine and Poland signed last month, according to an Energy Department news release.\n\nOn Friday evening, House Democrats issued their third subpoena this week for documents related to a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s leader. A subpoena issued earlier in the day to Pence by the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight panels seeks records related to May 23 and July 10 meetings at the White House that Perry attended, as well as documents about the decision to send him to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration instead of Pence.\n\nHouse Democrats have also sent a subpoena to Giuliani asking for communications involving Perry.\n\nBen Schreckinger contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a0/b0/55808d5747fcb01577a532fb5e48/19105-perry-gty-733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
