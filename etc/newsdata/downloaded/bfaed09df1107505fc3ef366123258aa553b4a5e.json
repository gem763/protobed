REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban built a steel fence on Hungary\u2019s border with Serbia to seal off the Balkans route of migration, where hundreds of thousands of people marched through from the Middle East to Western Europe at the peak of the crisis in 2015.\n\nThe EU relies on Turkey to curb the arrival of refugees into Europe following a 2016 agreement to seal off the Aegean route after more than 1 million people entered the bloc.\n\nTurkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, threatened to \u201copen the gates\u201d to allow those already in the country to head for Europe if the EU portrayed Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeast Syria negatively.\n\n\u201cThe next weeks will decide what Turkey does with these people,\u201d Orban told private broadcaster HirTV in an interview late on Wednesday. \u201cIt can steer them in two directions: take them back to Syria or set them off towards Europe.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey chooses the latter, these people will arrive at Hungary\u2019s southern border in huge masses,\u201d Orban said, adding that the EU, while criticizing Ankara, should provide more funds to Turkey to help rebuild Syrian towns.\n\nOrban, who has often been at loggerheads with Brussels over some of his policies affecting migrants, said currently there were about 90,000 people on the Balkans migration route and their ranks could swell to 100,000 shortly.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey sets off further hundreds of thousands on top of this, then we will need to use force to protect the Hungarian border and the Serbian-Hungarian frontier and I do not wish for anyone that we should need to resort to that,\u201d Orban said.\n\nOrban\u2019s nationalist government has forged close relations with Turkey, China and some ex-Soviet states in Middle Asia as part of an eastern opening initiative.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan is due to come to Budapest for a visit early next month.", "description": "Hungary would have to \"use force\" at its southern border with Serbia to protect the European Union's frontier if Turkey delivers on a threat to open the gates for refugees through the Balkans towards Europe, Hungary's prime minister said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441802192&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0LY", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
