They've urged the FDA to move faster to investigate and regulate e-cigarettes, which have been touted by manufacturers as a way to wean people from traditional cigarettes but have also led to what the FDA calls an \u201cepidemic\u201d of youth vaping of nicotine.\n\nPublic health officials haven't established a firm cause for the vaping-related respiratory illnesses. Counterfeit or black-market vapes may be playing a role, but legal vapes haven't been ruled out. Many of the cases have been linked to vaped forms of marijuana and its component, CBD.\n\nCapitol Hill Democrats swiftly backed the administration's move, calling it long overdue and further evidence that the growing e-cigarette market needs tight oversight. Democrats, led by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), had harshly criticized the administration\u2019s response to the respiratory illness, hammering the FDA for weeks over its delays in taking decisive action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been clear for years that an epidemic of youth e-cigarette addiction was building,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). \u201cIt should never have taken multiple deaths and hundreds of cases of teenagers with lung disease.\u201d\n\nInside the Trump administration, health officials have for months expressed concerns about the spread of e-cigarette use \u2014 and raised alarms about companies\u2019 marketing claims and product safety well before reports of vaping-related illness first made waves last month.\n\nFormer FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who left the administration this spring, pushed an aggressive anti-smoking agenda with Azar's backing, despite griping from some congressional Republicans who had lobbied for a more sympathetic approach to the vaping industry. Azar's allies say he's had a particularly strong interest in public health, including a deep skepticism of tobacco and e-cigarettes.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The Vapor Technology Association said there was no indication that its members products were to blame for recent cases of lung illness, adding that flavored vaping products have been shown to be one of the most effective smoking cessation tools\n\n\u201cBarring flavors would be a public health travesty,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nThe administration\u2019s announcement came as preliminary findings from a national youth tobacco survey indicate a continued rise in vaping, especially non-tobacco flavors. HHS said preliminary data show that more than a quarter of high school students had used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days, and the overwhelming majority of youth e-cigarette users cited the use of popular fruit and menthol or mint flavors.\n\nMint and menthol were not covered by FDA restrictions announced last fall that limited sales of flavored vaping products in convenience stories and gas stations.\n\nAzar said the administration within weeks would prioritize requirements subjecting flavored products, including mint and menthol, to pre-market reviews. The administration has been developing a rule requiring all e-cigarette makers to submit their products for review by May 2020 or pull them off the market.\n\nManufacturers would have to show the FDA administration that their products don't pose a public health threat. They would also need to demonstrate why any flavored products should stay on the market. E-cigarette manufacturers that submit products for review can keep their products on the market for a year while the FDA evaluates them.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,\u201d Azar said.\n\nThe agency in March acknowledged that many flavored vapes would likely be discontinued in response to the looming regulatory deadline and sales restrictions.\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Wednesday endorsed the administration's focus on vaping, but stopped short of backing a sweeping ban. Grassley has long expressed concern about presidents' use of executive powers, preferring instead for Congress to pass legislation.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the rise in underage vaping and the ability for devices to be tampered with in ways that might be especially hazardous to users' health,\" he said, adding that he's already discussed the issue with members of his panel. \"It's something we're looking into in the Finance Committee.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this report misstated the name of the Vapor Technology Association and the timetable for flavored e-cigarettes to stay on the market.
