I'm Ellen Mitchell, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\n\nTHE TOPLINE: President Trump has found himself increasingly isolated in Washington at a crucial point of his battle against House Democrats\u2019 fast-moving impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump alienated many Republicans with his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria as Turkey mounted an offensive against U.S.-allied Kurds, touching off a controversy that has reverberated for more than a week.\n\nMeanwhile, the president\u2019s White House team has largely been absent from the airwaves as the administration\u2019s blanket refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry is put to the test.\n\nAs a result, it has fallen largely on Trump to serve as his own messenger and defender on matters of policy and politics.\n\nHe has responded by lashing out in increasingly coarse terms at Democrats pursuing an impeachment case and his critics who question his foreign policy strategy.\n\nTrump\u2019s problems: Trump is dealing with a converging series of bad headlines on different topics.\n\nDemocrats in late September launched an impeachment inquiry, and a steady stream of witnesses have come to Capitol Hill over the past week to deliver damning testimony.\n\nEach witness seems to create a bad headline for Trump. On Tuesday, it was Fiona Hill, the senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs who said former national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonBolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Ex-top Trump Russia aide to testify about 'shadow policy' on Ukraine: report Bolton to write memoir on time serving under Trump: report MORE described Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiBolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report Ex-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry MORE as a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the White House faced questions about a violent video shared at a conservative gathering over the weekend that depicted Trump gunning down media organizations and prominent liberals. The White House denounced the video, but Trump has yet to say anything about it.\n\nAnd Trump has come under intense criticism over his Syria maneuverings from lawmakers in his own party, who represent his lines of defense on impeachment.\n\nRepublican strategists and former Trump advisers doubt that Republicans will break with Trump on impeachment because of differences over Syria, no matter how angry they are.\n\nSome support from Graham on sanctions: Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham throws support behind Trump's Turkey sanctions Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Fury over Trump Syria decision grows MORE (R-S.C.) said on Monday night that he backs Trump\u2019s decision to slap new financial penalties on Turkey and that the administration deserved \"reasonable time and space\" to implement its strategy in Syria.\n\n\"I strongly support President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE\u2019s decision to initiate executive order sanctions against Turkish officials and economy for Turkey\u2019s invasion of northeastern Syria. Turkey is attacking the Kurdish forces that supported us the most in destroying the ISIS Caliphate,\" Graham, one of the most vociferous opponents of Trump's recent move to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, said in a statement.\n\nGraham's comments came after he spoke with Trump and took part in calls with the president, administration officials and \"key leaders in this conflict.\"\n\nGraham added that his colleagues should publicly push back against Turkey's invasion of northern Syria and back Trump's sanctions plan, which the president announced earlier Monday.\n\nPOMPEO TO JOIN PENCE ON TURKEY TRIP: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump: Let Assad, Russia or China protect the Kurds Reporter presses Pompeo on whether he met with Giuliani in Warsaw Pompeo: 'I wish the NBA would acknowledge' China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims MORE will join Vice President Pence on a trip to Turkey this week in an attempt to broker a cease-fire in northern Syria.\n\nPence will lead a delegation on behalf of President Trump that includes Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O'Brien, the vice president's office announced Tuesday.\n\nPence will meet Thursday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for a bilateral meeting as the two sides seek to broker a deal to end the bloodshed that was sparked after Trump announced he was pulling U.S. troops out of the region.\n\nThe delegation will depart on Wednesday. It's unclear when they will return.\n\nPence\u2019s part: The vice president has become the leading voice on the push for a cease-fire in the region as Trump remains committed to pulling troops out of Syria and has called on other countries to fill the void left by the U.S.\n\n\"We\u2019re having very strong talks with a lot of people,\" Trump said at a White House ceremony on Tuesday afternoon to honor the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues. \"We want to bring our soldiers back home after so many years. They\u2019re the greatest warriors in the world. They\u2019re policing. They\u2019re not a police force.\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re being very tough on Turkey and a lot of others,\" he added. \"They have to maintain their own properties now. They have to maintain peace and safety.\"\n\nPence told reporters on Monday that Trump urged Erdo\u011fan to halt a Turkish invasion into northern Syria and begin negotiations with Kurdish forces in the region.\n\nShift in strategy: Efforts to broker a cease-fire, paired with sanctions on Ankara announced Monday, mark a shift in strategy for the White House amid fierce bipartisan backlash over Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria.\n\nThe change in strategy has had a ripple effect in the roughly 10 days since it was announced.\n\nWithin days, Turkey had launched an offensive into the region. The Turks targeted Kurdish forces, which have served as a key ally to the U.S. in the years-long fight against ISIS in the region.\n\nIn an effort to turn back the Turkish offensive, the Kurds struck a deal to join Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. The two had previously been on opposing sides of a bloody civil war, and Assad is backed by Russia.\n\nBut Turkish troops still on the move: Turkey advanced its assault in northeastern Syria on Tuesday after Trump announced sanctions over its military campaign.\n\nSyrian fighters backed by Ankara said they would continue their advance toward the city of Manbij, a key flashpoint west of the Euphrates River, according to Reuters. A Reuters cameraman also reported heavy bombing of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, where a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a group largely made up of Kurdish fighters, reported an ongoing battle was taking place.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT - BOEING\n\nNext-gen technology for missions of the future:\n\nSupporting the H-47 Chinook Block II enhancements will lift the nation above any challenge for decades to come.
