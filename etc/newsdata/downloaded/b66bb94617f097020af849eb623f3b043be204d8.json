SARS says you don't have to file returns - here's why you probably should", "language": "en", "text": "Seivitz highlights these reasons why you should consider still filing a tax return:\n\n1. You may miss out on a refund\n\nWhy let SARS keep your money if you are due a refund? A refund is money you overpaid on your taxes and it belongs to you.\n\nYou can only get a refund if you file a return. Something as simple as claiming Medical expenses or working for less than 12 months of the tax year can trigger a tax refund, depending on your situation. (You can calculate a refund here.)\n\n2. You may not be able to borrow money\n\nIf you wish to borrow money in the form of a mortgage for a home, or a long term loan of any kind in future, you may need a Tax Clearance Certificate. This can only be obtained if all your returns are up to date and filed appropriately.\n\n3. SARS might change its mind\n\nIf you normally submit, but this year you don't, SARS could administer administrative penalties later on down the line for not being compliant.\n\n4. \u200eYou can't access your retirement fund payout\n\nFiling a tax return each and every year means that should you receive a payout from a fund at any stage, then you will not have any hassle in getting the money. If you retire or are retrenched, or just need to take money out of your fund early, you need to be tax compliant.\n\n", "description": "Maintaining an unbroken history with SARS could count in your favour later on.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7644/8c2c3f73eead4e30b33423d253602fe7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-05"}
