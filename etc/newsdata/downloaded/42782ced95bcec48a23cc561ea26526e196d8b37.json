I Have Some Notes.", "language": "en", "text": "Did she have edits? \u201cThere was quite a bit about strip clubs,\u201d Erin recalled. \u201cYou know, cocaine and strip clubs go hand in hand. And I said, \u2018Dad, I love ya, but there does not need to be a ton of strip clubs in this.\u2019\u201d Carr agreed to cut those scenes, but there were darker, tougher moments that Erin said she knew better than to ask him to change. \u201cThe most painful stuff was about violence toward women, including my mother. But that\u2019s what the book is about. That made me wildly uncomfortable, but I knew my dad was not going to hide behind comfort.\u201d\n\nLyra, too, is a writer, and when she finally returned my manuscript to me \u2014 after a nerve-racking afternoon during which I heard her laughing in her room but also shouting \u201cDad, you did a drug!\u201d when she got to the pot-smoking scene \u2014 many of her suggestions were purely editorial. \u201cThis is the third time you described me as \u2018simmering with rage,\u2019\u201d she wrote in the margin, along with a little drawing of herself, in a pot, simmering ragefully. (Great note. I cut the other two.)\n\nBut she also requested that I cut a scene of her crying, and identified a larger problem with the way she was portrayed. \u201cWith me it\u2019s all arguments and problems,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t cause a lot of problems on the trip, but a lot of the chapters are, like, me being bad, me being bad, me being bad, and then Harper\u201d \u2014 her sister, two years younger and not yet ready to read the book \u2014 \u201cdoing something sweet, and that\u2019s the end.\u201d\n\nWell! That was an astute criticism of a structure I\u2019d apparently employed a few times too often. To my surprise I found myself making significant rewrites based on my tween\u2019s comments, sharpening the relationship between the sisters, looking through my notebooks for more examples of Lyra\u2019s joy to counteract the misery I\u2019d focused on.\n\nThe lesson of sharing your work with a family member is that sometimes the story you wrote in private becomes less precious to you when you face the possibility of hurting someone you love with it. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an author, you\u2019re told that everything should be included,\u201d Carr said. By whom? \u201cBy \u2026 the machine of writing. The machine of making a memoir. But it shouldn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nCould I give Lyra a little of the story back? Allowing a family member to weigh in on a work can lead to surprising kinds of collaboration. Mary McCarthy\u2019s \u201cMemories of a Catholic Girlhood\u201d (1957) intersperses autobiographical essays she\u2019d written for The New Yorker and other magazines with self-lacerating interludes inspired by an uncle disputing those essays, turning the entire book into a pointed commentary on the fallibility of memory. When John Schwartz, a science reporter for The New York Times, finished his first draft of \u201cOddly Normal,\u201d his 2012 memoir about his son Joe\u2019s difficult teenage coming-out, he printed it out, sat next to Joe at the dining-room table, and waited while he read every page. Not only did Joe make a half-dozen sharp comments, Schwartz recalled, \u201cit helped him get invested in the book\u201d \u2014 to the point that Joe later gave his dad a story and asked if it might fit in somehow. It\u2019s the final chapter.\n\nThe journalist Elizabeth Weil also gave her daughter Hannah a chance to respond to her 2017 essay \u201cRaising a Teenage Daughter.\u201d Hannah\u2019s annotations appeared alongside the essay in The California Sunday Magazine. Weil writes, \u201cWhen Hannah was young, she said why at least a thousand times a day,\u201d and Hannah replies, tartly, \u201cI thought adults knew and understood everything.\u201d\n\nInspired by Hannah\u2019s annotations, I asked Lyra to write an addendum to \u201cmy\u201d book, which was, of course, her book too. I asked her to respond to the question, \u201cWhat did your dad get wrong about you in the book?\u201d In that addendum, Lyra complains that I made her a \u201cprecocious jerk,\u201d but allows that she did not entirely dislike her portrayal. She\u2019s proud of the book now, and proud of me, and that means a lot. I showed her this essay before I filed it, and 15 minutes later she brought the laptop back to me and said: \u201cGreat draft, Dad. I had some notes.\u201d", "description": "Should an author\u2019s family have a say in what the author chooses to write about them?", "authors": ["Dan Kois"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/books/review/20Kois-WEB/20Kois-WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
