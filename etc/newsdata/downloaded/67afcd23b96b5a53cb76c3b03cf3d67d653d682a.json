The referendum at the prominent university in the District drew attention to a broader national debate over reparations to atone for the evils of slavery.\n\nAD\n\nGeorgetown students, estimating the fee would raise $400,000 a year, had pressed university leaders to adopt the idea. \u201cRespect our vote!\u201d they chanted this month at a meeting of the university\u2019s board of directors.\n\nAD\n\nThe university responded with a plan that officials said would carry out the goal of supporting descendants of the enslaved, without charging a fee.\n\n\u201cWe embrace the spirit of this student proposal and will work with our Georgetown community to create an initiative that will support community-based projects with Descendant communities,\u201d university President John J. DeGioia wrote in a letter to the campus Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis work will be grounded in our academic mission of education, research, and service; will provide opportunities for student leadership; and will be guided by extensive consultation and engagement with Descendants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDeGioia said Georgetown \u201cwill ensure that the initiative has resources commensurate with, or exceeding, the amount that would have been raised annually\u201d through the proposed student fee.\n\nAD\n\nAnother university official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to elaborate on the plan, said donors have \u201cexpressed a lot of interest\u201d in the university\u2019s efforts related to slavery, racial justice and reconciliation.\n\nOfficials said they do not want to dictate what the initiatives will be. The university said in a statement that it envisions projects with long-term benefit \u201csuch as developing a new preschool program or health care initiative.\u201d\n\nLeaders of a group called Students for GU272, which backed the referendum, had no immediate comment Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nLike many other universities, Georgetown has wrestled in recent years with the legacy of its ties to slavery.\n\nFounded in 1789, Georgetown was the nation\u2019s first Catholic school of higher learning. Its roots are deeply entwined with the history of slavery in Maryland and the nation\u2019s capital. Those connections have long been known, but they have emerged in a much more public way in recent years at the highly ranked university, which has more than 7,400 undergraduates and thousands more graduate students.\n\nAD\n\nAmid student demonstrations in fall 2015, the university decided to remove from campus buildings the names of two Jesuit priests who orchestrated the 1838 sale of 272 people enslaved on Maryland plantations.\n\nAD\n\nThose priests, the Revs. Thomas Mulledy and William McSherry, were early presidents of Georgetown. Proceeds from the sale ($115,000, or more than $3 million in today\u2019s dollars) were used to pay school debts. The deal uprooted enslaved families and dispersed men, women and children to plantations in Louisiana.\n\nIn September 2016, Georgetown pledged to give descendants of those whom the Jesuits sold a preference in admissions to the highly competitive university \u2014 treating such applicants as if they were the children of faculty members, staff or alumni. About 10 to 12 descendants have since enrolled. The university also announced that year that it would apologize for its role in the slave trade.\n\nAD\n\nThe apology was delivered in a religious ceremony held at a campus chapel in April 2017. It was attended by more than 100 descendants of those sold. At that ceremony, Georgetown also named a student residence hall for the first enslaved person listed on the 1838 bill of sale: Isaac Hawkins, 65, patriarch of a family sold in the deal the Jesuits struck with two Louisiana businessmen.\n\nAD\n\nBut descendants, students and others argued that Georgetown should do more. Calls mounted for the university to create a reparations fund for the descendants.\n\n\u201cAs students at an elite institution, we recognize the great privileges we have been given, and wish to at least partially repay our debts to those families whose involuntary sacrifices made these privileges possible,\u201d sponsors of the student referendum wrote. \u201cAs individuals with moral imagination, we choose to do more than simply recognize the past \u2014 we resolve to change our future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGeorgetown officials said Tuesday that the university is committed to working with descendants, aiming to launch projects in fall 2020. Officials said they plan to form advisory groups to develop ideas for academic, research and public history initiatives as well as engagement with thousands of descendants of the enslaved people.\n\n\n\nAD", "description": "The initiative will be supported by fundraising and not by fees proposed in a student referendum.", "authors": ["Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market", "Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MUwamSW-UgFst81YWfnIiBBRv7M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4VCK6X2PEI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
