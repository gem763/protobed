Foreign countries are legally bound to use the money we give them to buy armaments from American manufacturers.\n\nLikewise, we often demand government reforms and an end to corruption. Sometimes we have demanded specific actions, such as when former Vice President Joe Biden demanded the prosecutor looking into his son\u2019s company be fired.\n\nSo, really, \u201cquid pro quo\u201d seems to be the norm rather than the exception.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank loans money to foreign entities \u2014 the quid \u2014 and demands that the foreigners buy American-made goods \u2014 the quo.\n\nBut Democrats opine that Trump made foreign aid (welfare) contingent on investigating a potential rival, which makes the whole quid pro quo exchange somehow an impeachable offense.\n\nBut I\u2019ve yet to hear Democrats complain about the money (quid) that Hillary Clinton paid foreign spy Christopher Steele to get dirt (the quo) on her political opponent \u2014 Donald Trump.\n\nDo Democrats really believe they can sweep the quid pro quo of Hillary Clinton and Christopher Steele under the rug and ignore it?\n\nThe Senate should immediately commence public hearings that parallel the House hearings. The Senate hearings should investigate the quid pro quo of Hillary Clinton transferring money to a foreign spy in exchange for the Steele dossier.\n\nHillary Clinton should be compelled to answer under oath: was there a quid pro quo?\n\nFormer CIA head and current Trump-hater John Brennan should be summoned and asked: \u201cDid you contact any foreign spy agencies or agents (active or retired) to investigate then-candidate Donald Trump?\u201d Was there a quid pro quo?\n\nFormer FBI head and current Trump-hater James Comey should be summoned and asked: \u201cDid the FBI exchange money with a foreign spy to collect information on candidate Donald Trump?\u201d Was there a quid pro quo?\n\nIf Democrats want the American people to believe Donald Trump did something wrong in asking Ukraine to investigate the $50,000 a month that Hunter Biden was receiving, they will first have to admit that their fearless leader Hillary Clinton actually did much worse by paying a foreign spy, Christopher Steele, money for dirt on Trump.\n\nTo convince the American public that their impeachment inquiry is anything other than empty partisanship, the Democrats will also have to admit that the Obama administration ginned up and purposefully spread the now-discredited Steele dossier. Democrats will further have to admit that Robert Mueller\u2019s $35 million investigation found the Steele dossier to be pure fiction.\n\nWhen the Democrats admit that they have committed \u201cquid pro quo\u201d a dozen times in trying to entrap President Trump, then, and only then, will American voters consider their impeachment inquiry anything other than a witch hunt.\n\nRand Paul is serving his second term in the U.S. Senate, representing the State of Kentucky.", "description": "Democrats should admit that they have committed \u201cquid pro quo\u201d a dozen times in trying to entrap President Trump.", "authors": ["Sen.
