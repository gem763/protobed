The malware was injected by initiating a WhatsApp call which the targets did not need to answer for their phones to become infected.\n\nThe hacking tool, dubbed \u201cPegasus\u201d could remotely retrieve calls, messages, and location on smartphones running Android, iOS, and BlackBerry operating systems.\n\nNSO Group is reported to have several government contracts around the world for surveillance tools and Pegasus is its most popular products. It responded to the suit claiming that \"in the strongest possible terms\" it denied the allegations and would \"vigorously fight them\". It said its sole purpose was to fight terrorism and serious crime on behalf of intelligence and law enforcement agencies. A spokesman said: \"The truth is that strongly encrypted platforms are often used by pedophile rings, drug kinpins and terrorists to shield their criminal activity. Wiithout sophisticated technologies, the law enforcement agencies meant to keep us all safe face insurmountable hurdles. NSO's technologies provide proportionate, lawful solutions to this issue.\"", "description": "WhatsApp is suing an Israeli surveillance company for a cyber attack targeting 1,400 users earlier this year.", "authors": ["Margi Murphy", "Us Technology Reporter", "Tom Hoggins", "Hannah Betts"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/08/01/TELEMMGLPICT000150461853-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXDVXE4-NcPVfcZy5a1cUJ04.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
