It takes years of hard work and dedication to reach this level as a referee, and to maintain this standard year-in and year-out is even more challenging as it requires one to produce effective performances consistently.\n\n\"We wish Jaco all the best for the match and for the rest of the World Cup.\"\n\n\n\nMatch officials for the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals:\n\nEngland v Australia\n\n\n\nSaturday, 09:15 (SA time)\n\nOita Stadium\n\nReferee: Jerome Garces (France)\n\nAssistant referee: Romain Poite (France)\n\nAssistant referee: Mathieu Raynal (France)\n\nTMO: Ben Skeen (New Zealand)\n\n\n\nNew Zealand v Ireland\n\n\n\nSaturday, 12:15 (SA time)\n\nTokyo Stadium\n\nReferee: Nigel Owens (Wales)\n\nAssistant referee: Pascal Gauzere (France)\n\nAssistant referee: Angus Gardner (Australia)\n\nTMO: Graham Hughes (England)\n\n\n\nWales v France\n\n\n\nSunday, 09:15 (SA time)\n\nOita Stadium\n\nReferee: Jaco Peyper (South Africa)\n\nAssistant referee: Nic Berry (Australia)\n\nAssistant referee: Paul Williams (New Zealand)\n\nTMO: Marius Jonker (South Africa)\n\n\n\nJapan v South Africa\n\nSunday, 12:15 (SA time)\n\nTokyo Stadium\n\nReferee: Wayne Barnes (England)\n\nAssistant referee: Ben O\u2019Keeffe (New Zealand)\n\nAssistant referee: Luke Pearce (England)\n\nTMO: Rowan Kitt (England)\n\n\n\n- SA Rugby", "description": "South Africa's Jaco Peyper will referee his 50th Test when he takes charge of the Wales v France Rugby World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9473/0f20299ba0ce4042939b9415a76a837e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
