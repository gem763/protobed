You can also start the chat by typing \"guide\" to CBC News on Messenger.\n\nIf you opt in, the chat bot will guide you through five weeks of learning about deepfakes, altered photos and articles that may look like they're from news sites \u2014 but aren't. Here's what you will learn:\n\nWeek one: Determining trustworthy sources.\n\nWeek two: Spotting suspicious articles.\n\nWeek three: Manipulated photos and videos.\n\nWeek four: Deepfakes.\n\nWeek five: How to avoid spreading disinformation.\n\nThe tool is part of a wider CBC News initiative to investigate so-called \"fake news\" and any attempts to disrupt the election. The goal is to give you tools to spot it and hopefully avoid sharing untrue information.\n\nYou can learn more in our misinformation and disinformation guides:", "description": "CBC has created a chat bot tool for Facebook Messenger to help you spot disinformation and\u00a0decide what news sources you can trust throughout the campaign.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5282302.1568383451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chatbot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
