REUTERS/Toby Melville -/File Photo\n\nFreddy McConnell, a transgender man, wanted to be recognised as the father of his son, who was born last year, on the official birth certificate but was told he would have to be registered as the mother.\n\nHe sought legal action to quash that decision, saying it breached his and his son\u2019s rights but in a landmark ruling, Andrew McFarlane, President of the High Court\u2019s Family Division, dismissed his claim and concluded that McConnell was the mother.\n\n\u201cIt is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child,\u201d McFarlane said.\n\n\u201cWhilst that person\u2019s gender is \u2018male\u2019, their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of \u2018mother.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcConnell, who was registered as female at birth, transitioned to live as male when aged 22, later undergoing a double mastectomy and testosterone therapy. Official details, such as his passport and health records, were amended to show his gender as male, court papers said.\n\nIn 2016, he suspended the testosterone treatment and became pregnant after undergoing intrauterine insemination fertility treatment using donor sperm, with the baby born in January 2018.\n\nMcFarlane said the issue had been \u201cmost properly and bravely\u201d raised by McConnell and was an important matter for public debate, but related more to public policy than law.\n\n\u201cDown the centuries, no court has previously been required to determine the definition of \u2018mother\u2019 under English common law and, it seems, that there have been few comparable decisions made in other courts elsewhere in the Western World,\u201d he said.\n\nCampaign group Stonewall called the decision deeply disappointing and said the law desperately needed to be updated.\n\n\u201cWe believe this ruling is a missed opportunity to send a positive message and recognise all parents, including LGBT parents, for who they are,\u201d said Laura Russell, its director of communications.", "description": "An individual who is born female but later becomes male and gives birth to a child should be legally regarded as a mother, England's High Court ruled on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433775261&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O19L", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
