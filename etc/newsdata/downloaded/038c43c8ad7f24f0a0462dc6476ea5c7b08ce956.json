In July, it announced the 1st rate cut since the financial crisis in an attempt to keep the record economic expansion going as risks \u2014 namely, Trump's trade war \u2014 threaten economic growth.\n\nBusinesses have pulled back on spending in the face of the uncertainty, and the pace of hiring has slowed.\n\n\"People are nervous about where [trade is] going to go, especially obviously for exporters or global companies,\" says Kashkari, who gets a vote on the rotating monetary policy setting committee next year.\n\n\"If everyone is spooked, that\u2019s enough to maybe tip the economy over.\"\n\nOn whether or not the Fed's actions to lower rates could give Trump cover to ramp up the trade war \u2014 a topic of a highly controversial op-ed by former New York Fed president Bill Dudley \u2014 Kashkari says that inflation running below its 2% target is a major factor for the Fed's move, too.\n\nLet's say, if we had inflation well above target, and we were worried that inflation expectations were climbing, I think then we would be much more reluctant to say, 'Well, we're going to try to cut rates because of the trade war.' ... Setting aside what the cause is, just looking at that data \u2014 that data would imply you want a more accommodative monetary policy.\n\n\u2014 Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari\n\nThe big picture: The Fed is hearing from community leaders and activists in a series of unprecedented \u201clistening sessions\u201c across the country. The events, as chairman Jerome Powell has pointed out many times, have convinced the Fed of the importance of keeping the recovery going for communities that are still convalescing from the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom was monetary policy does not have a role to play in distributional outcomes ... We\u2019ve now learned that monetary policy has the biggest role to play because we need to create the context for all of these different groups to be able to participate in the economy,\u201d Kashkari tells Axios.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Although he won't have a vote at this month's Fed meeting, Kashkari would be voting with what may be the majority.", "description": "In an interview with Axios, the Minneapolis Fed president says he\u2019ll \u201clikely\u201d support a rate cut later this month", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/d7bQSmfNmC73gvJqrlS2lfmh2sI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570744315099.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
