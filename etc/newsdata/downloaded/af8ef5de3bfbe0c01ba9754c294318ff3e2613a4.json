Nassar\u2019s victims, many of them student athletes or professional gymnasts, described the former associate professor groping their genitalia for extended amounts of time. Nassar was eventually sentenced to between 40 and 175 years in prison.\n\nRead: The moral catastrophe at Michigan State\n\nNumerous attempts to report Nassar were allegedly ignored or otherwise mishandled, including by MSU coaches and other administrators, according to lawsuits and victims\u2019 testimony. After conducting its own Title IX investigation into a complaint filed by a student in 2014 detailing Nassar\u2019s alleged abuse, the school concluded in a report provided to the accuser that he had simply provided \u201cmedically appropriate\u201d treatments and hadn\u2019t engaged in misconduct, records show. Findings distributed internally, on the other hand, censured Nassar\u2019s actions, concluding that he had inflicted \u201cunnecessary trauma\u201d on his students, according to reporting by The Detroit News in January 2018. The investigation was spearheaded by an attorney employed by MSU full-time as its Title IX coordinator; that employee was subsequently tapped as the university\u2019s assistant general counsel, a position she holds to this day, according to the school\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, as bad as the Nassar situation was, it was just part of the infractions that led to the Education Department\u2019s fines. Just after Nassar\u2019s sentencing last spring, a separate investigation\u2014this one conducted by law-enforcement officials\u2014uncovered evidence that William Strampel, then the dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine, had himself propositioned and molested students. Strampel, who resigned as dean in late 2017, was eventually charged with criminal sexual misconduct and willful neglect of duty. He was recently sentenced to a year of prison time, for both his own misdeeds and, additionally, his failure to protect students from Nassar, who worked beneath him.\n\nIn a statement, the Education Department described MSU\u2019s \u201csystemic failure to protect students from sexual abuse.\u201d Specifically, the university \u201cfailed to take appropriate interim measures to protect its students while complaints against Nassar and Strampel were pending, and failed to take prompt and effective steps to end any harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, and prevent any further harassment from recurring,\u201d the department stated. The department\u2019s investigation found that the university violated four federal-policy requirements, including crime-reporting duties and a commitment to issue timely warnings on campus.\n\n\"What transpired at Michigan State was abhorrent, inexcusable, and a total and complete failure to follow the law and protect students,\" DeVos said in a call with reporters. \u201cI want to thank each of the survivors who came forward and shared their stories. Doing so took an incredible amount of courage. Never again should incidents of sexual misconduct on campuses\u2014or anywhere\u2014be swept under the rug.\u201d", "description": "The Education Department\u2019s record-high fine against MSU underscores the extent to which the university botched its handling of various sexual-abuse scandals.", "authors": ["Alia Wong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX4N25P/facebook.jpg?1568125280", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
