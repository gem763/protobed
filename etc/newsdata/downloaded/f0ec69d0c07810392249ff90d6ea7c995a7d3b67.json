Scott Wilhoit, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nPresident Donald Trump is betting that a strong economy will propel him to reelection even as early warning signs of a slowdown have emerged in 2019.\n\nConsumers may hold the key.\n\nRepresenting two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, consumer optimism or pessimism has the power to forestall or precipitate a slowdown or recession.\n\n\"Most incumbents won reelection near cyclical peaks in confidence; when confidence was near cyclical troughs (lows), the winning candidate was usually from the opposite party,\" said Richard Curtin, director at the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, in an Oct. 4 report.\n\nEarlier this month, the college's closely-watched Index of Consumer Sentiment reported a continued rebound to a 96.0 preliminary reading in October after dropping in August to 89.8 amid trade and economic jitters.\n\nCurtin said there's a big difference: a reading in the 90s indicates an economy that is expanding, while a mid-80s reading is only \"fair.\" A reading below 70 reflects a recession. More important than the number is the direction, he said.\n\nRetirement tips: Doing this simple thing once a year can help you save more\n\nIn the workplace: More employers offer flexible hours, but many grapple with how to make it succeed\n\nPresident Donald Trump waves after landing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2019, as he visits Dayton, Ohio, following the mass shooting that left nine dead and 27 injured early Sunday morning.

Barack Obama won a second term with a lower reading, but the index was rising.\n\n\u2022 The last three presidents voted out of office (George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford) lost in years when the index hovered below its 86.6 average reading.\n\n\u2022 Strong readings don't appear to guarantee the party in power another term. Democratic nominee Al Gore lost in 2000 when sentiment was at its highest in an election year. Four other nominees for the incumbent party lost despite solid sentiment.\n\nHere's a look at the University of Michigan's index on consumers and where it stood in past election years:\n\nFor the latest on Cincinnati business, P&G, Kroger and Fifth Third Bank, follow @alexcoolidge on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/21/2020-election-what-consumer-sentiment-index-tells-us-vote/4052357002/", "description": "President Donald Trump is betting that a strong economy will propel him to re-election even as early warning signs of a slowdown have emerged.", "authors": ["Alexander Coolidge", "Published A.M.
