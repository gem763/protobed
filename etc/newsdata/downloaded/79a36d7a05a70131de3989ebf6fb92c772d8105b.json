She was 84 years old.\n\nThe performer died at her Los Angeles residence after a years-long battle against breast cancer, according to her publicist.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actress \u2014 who won a Tony Award for her star turn in Broadway\u2019s \u201cNo Strings\u201d in 1962 \u2014 was known for her chic elegance as well as her trailblazing performance in 1968\u2019s \u201cJulia.\u201d\n\nBorn July 17, 1935 in New York\u2019s Bronx borough, Carroll proved a gifted singer from a young age, and worked as a model as well as in musical theater before being cast in the 1959 screen adaptation of \u201cPorgy and Bess.\u201d\n\nIt was \u201cJulia\u201d that catapulted her to celebrity \u2014 nabbing her a Golden Globe award and an Emmy nomination \u2014 as she portrayed a professional black woman in an era when black actresses generally played stereotypical secondary roles.\n\nBut while \u201cJulia\u201d was seen as groundbreaking it also fell under sharp criticism for allegedly white-washing the black experience in a tumultuous 1960s America plagued by racial inequality.\n\nIn films she starred opposite performers like Sidney Poitier, Paul Newman and Michael Caine.\n\nThe primetime soap opera \u201cDynasty\u201d saw Carroll establish herself on the global stage, playing a glamorous schemer \u2014 and the antagonist to Joan Collins\u2019 character \u2014 in the series about a well-heeled Colorado family.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be the first black bitch on television,\u201d Carroll said in an interview on her first day on the \u201cDynasty\u201d set.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never played a role quite this unlikeable,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that very much because I think very often, particularly minorities, it\u2019s almost required of them that they are nice people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to play a nice person.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Diahann Carroll, the first black woman to star in her own primetime show and who later gained international acclaim for her role", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/abb315_diahann-carroll-sidney-poitier-36th-naacp-image-awards-in-2005-trailblazing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
