The Houthis maintained it was a detention center.\n\n\u201cWitnessing this massive damage, seeing the bodies lying among the rubble was a real shock,\u201d said Franz Rauchenstein, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yemen. \u201cPeople who are not taking active part in combat should not die in such a way.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, also known as the ICRC, the multistory building which served as a detention facility collapsed from the airstrike. It held around 170 detainees, and 40 of them were being treated for injuries. \u201cThe rest are presumed killed, though no toll has been confirmed, \u201d said the ICRC.\n\nThe UN\u2019s primary human rights office in Yemen said 52 detainees were among the dead, and that at least 68 detainees are still missing\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event is a tragedy,\u201d said Martin Griffiths, special envoy of the secretary general for Yemen in a statement. \u201cI hope the Coalition will launch an enquiry into this incident. Accountability needs to prevail.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition did not immediately respond to the reports confirming the attack struck a detention facility.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were fears that the airstrike had killed civilians.\n\n\u201cWe are taking these reports extremely seriously,\u201d Rauchenstein said in a tweet. earlier on Sunday and before he and his team visited the area. \u201cI am on my way to Dahmar #Yemen to assess the situation. We have visited detainees in this location before, as we do in other places as part of our work.\u201d\n\nIn a separate tweet, the Red Cross said it had dispatched a team carrying \u201curgent medical supplies that can treat up to 100 critically wounded persons.\u201d It added that it would pick up 200 donated body bags along the way, \u201cfollowing airstrikes which are reported to have killed or wounded dozens of detainees.\u201d\n\nThe attack is the latest by the Saudi-led coalition to target civilians in Yemen. Air assaults have in the past struck hospitals, health clinics, markets, even school buses. The coalition has said it has taken measures to prevent civilian casualties, but human rights groups and the United Nations say it continues to break international law.\n\nThe coalition has launched airstrikes on Houthi detention facilities in previous years. An October 2016 attack on a prison in the western port city of Hodeida killed more than 60 people.\n\nThe coalition, made up Sunni Muslim countries, has been battling the Shiite Houthis since March 2015 in an effort to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government and prevent Iran from gaining influence through its alliance with the Houthis.\n\nIn recent months, the Houthis have shown greater military capability, targeting Saudi airports and oil fields with armed drones and missiles. The coalition has responded with airstrikes.\n\nAs many as 95,000 people, including tens of thousands of civilians, have been killed by violence since the war began, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a nongovernmental organization tracking war casualties in Yemen.\n\nOn Sunday, Yemeni Red Crescent volunteers removed bodies from the rubble with the help of bulldozers and other heavy machinery, the ICRC said, adding that it would take several days to find all the corpses.\n\n\u201cThese detainees shall not be and are not forgotten,\u201d said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC\u2019s regional director for the Middle East in a statement, urging the Yemen\u2019s warring parties to behave more responsibly when conducting military operations.\n\n\u201cThe conflict in Yemen is claiming too many civilian victims and others not taking part in hostilities,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nSix reasons the crisis in Yemen\u2019s south matters\n\nYemen: Seizure of Aden by separatists exposes rift within Saudi Arabia and UAE coalition\n\nThe UAE is weakening its partnership with the Saudis in Yemen.
