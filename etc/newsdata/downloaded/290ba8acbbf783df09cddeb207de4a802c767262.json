He told the jury about family vacations and holidays, but said everything was not perfect in their home. He told the jury that she would hide food, and said he would sometimes hear her throwing up.\n\n\u201cI just wanted her to be happy,\u201d he said.\n\nBrooke Richardson is accused of killing and burying her newborn daughter in her backyard in July 2017. Prosecutors allege she did not want to be an 18-year-old single mom. Richardson\u2019s attorneys argued that the baby was stillborn and didn\u2019t meet the legal criteria to be considered a child.\n\nRichardson, now 20, is facing trial for aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, gross abuse of a corpse and child endangerment. She has pleaded not guilty. On Tuesday, a judge threw out a charge of tampering with evidence, saying that the prosecution did not meet its burden of proof on that charge.\n\nRELATED: Ex-Cheerleader Accused of Killing Newborn Blew off Doctors\u2019 Calls, Didn\u2019t Have Ultrasound: Prosecutors\n\nView photos Greg Lynch/The Journal-News via AP More\n\nRELATED: Everything to Know About Trial for Cheerleader Accused of Murdering Her Newborn and Burying Body\n\nProsecutors allege that Richardson did not want to be a single teen mom with college only a few months away.
