Jack Mooney to \u2018explore other opportunities\u2019 somewhere a bit less hot.\n\nThe BBC is keeping his exit storyline under wraps, but his final scenes will air during series nine which airs in early 2020.\n\nArdal said: \u2018I\u2019ve spent the last four summers in Guadeloupe playing DI Jack Mooney (solving over 20 murder cases in my time there!) It\u2019s been a hugely rewarding and unforgettable experience, working with incredibly talented actors, directors and crew while discovering a magical part of the world.\n\n\u2018However, it\u2019s time to move on and explore other opportunities \u2013 preferably nearer the Arctic Circle. I\u2019m confident that Death in Paradise will go from strength to strength and viewers will share my enthusiasm for Jack\u2019s successor!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut be prepared to get hit right in the feels, as executive producer Tim Key hinted: \u2018I don\u2019t think there will be a dry eye in the house.\u2019\n\nArdal played D.I. Jack Mooney (Picture: BBC)\n\nJack became part of the show when the Carribbean police team investigated a lead in London, taking the detective back to the fictional island of Saint Marie to solve murder mysteries on the sunny shores of Guadeloupe.\n\nDeath In Paradise remains one of the BBC\u2019s most popular shows, with season eight drawing in an average of over seven millions viewers.\n\nHe is the latest star to depart the crime drama after Danny John-Jules (Dwayne) and Josephine Jobert (Florence).\n\nDanny was replaced by Shyko Amos, who plays new police officer Ruby Patterson.\n\nWhile the show\u2019s sunny location suggests that it\u2019s all plain sailing on set \u2013 that\u2019s not always the case, as Shyko recently tore her calf muscle and was left on crutches.\n\nDeath In Paradise returns to BBC in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
