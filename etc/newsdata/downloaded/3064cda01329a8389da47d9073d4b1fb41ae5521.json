The money will pay back Quadriga\u2019s 76,319 creditors, mostly clients of the exchange, who are collectively owed $214.6 million in cash and cryptocurrency. (Globe and Mail)\n\nTalking point: The money became inaccessible in December 2018 when Gerald Cotten, co-founder and CEO of what was once Canada\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, died from Crohn\u2019s disease complications in India. Like most exchanges, Quadriga stored its assets in \u201ccold\u201d or offline wallets, which are impossible to access without knowing the private keys, or encrypted passwords; Cotten was the only person at the company with that knowledge. That\u2019s part of what makes exchanging digital currency so secure, but it\u2019s a double-edged sword\u2014if the key is lost, the money is gone forever. The crypto industry is still unregulated in Canada, so there are no official rules governing how a company as large as Quadriga should manage access to its private keys. Canada securities regulators are currently engaged in a consultative process to help establish regulations for exchanges.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
