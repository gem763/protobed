They\u2019re very soft in the middle. Almost like a paste.\u2019\n\nGreg\u2019s sweetbreads let him down (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe judges praised his lamb dish (Picture: BBC)\n\nGregg added: \u2018Your flavours are superb. Your cooking of the lamb and the making of the sauce and the puree is fantastic. So much to admire on there but the sweetbreads are a problem.\u2019\n\nThe athlete explained that lamb was one of the first things he cooked to try and impress his wife. Unfortunately she wasn\u2019t a fan but didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings, so she stuffed it in her handbag instead.\n\nGreg\u2019s dish was inspired by family holidays (Picture: BBC)\n\nBoxer Dillian Whyte was sent home early in the show for undercooking his meringue creation.\n\nThe remaining celebs went on to the Chef\u2019s Table round that saw former Geordie Shore star Vicky excel at her lobster dish.\n\nJust one more round remains between the celebs and the MasterChef trophy \u2013 who will rise to the top?\n\nCelebrity MasterChef continues Friday at 8.30pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
