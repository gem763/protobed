However, in Farrow\u2019s new book, which has been obtained by Variety, former NBC employee Nevils alleges that she was anally raped by the now 61-year-old in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, Lauer denied allegations of assault, saying: \u2018I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC.\n\n\u2018However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Variety, Nevils told Farrow that Lauer raped her while at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where she was working with Meredith Vieira.\n\nThe claims are made in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book (Picture: Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images)\n\nNevils alleges that one night, she was drinking with Vieira at their hotel bar and had six shots of tequila when they ran into Lauer.\n\nShe claims she went to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice \u2013 once to retrieve her press pass, and once after the star asked her back.\n\nFarrow writes that Nevils had \u2018no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly\u2019.\n\nNevils reportedly alleges that Lauer, who was wearing a t-shirt and boxers, pushed her against the door to kiss her before pushing her onto the bed, \u2018flipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex\u2019.\n\nNevils alleges that she told Lauer multiple times that she didn\u2019t want to, before he \u2018just did it\u2019.\n\nFarrow writes: \u2018Lauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u201cIt hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u201d She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow. Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days\u201d.\u2019\n\nMeredith Vieira allegedly instructed Nevils to go to HR (Picture: Ryan Born/FilmMagic)\n\nNevils reportedly told Farrow: \u2018It was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent. It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevils told Farrow that she went on to have further sexual encounters with Lauer when they went back to New York City, with \u2018sources close to Lauer [emphasising] that she sometimes initiated contact\u2019.\n\nFarrow writes that Nevils told multiple colleagues and superiors at NBC but nothing was pursued until 2017, after allegations of sexual assault and misconduct were made about Harvey Weinstein, leading to the beginning of the #MeToo movement.\n\nNevils allegedly told Vieira, who urged her to tell NBC Universal resources. However, Nevils alleges that chairman of NBC News and MSNBC Andrew Lack and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim \u2018were emphasising that the incident hadn\u2019t been \u201ccriminal\u201d or an \u201cassault\u201d\u2018.\n\nNevils went on medical leave from NBC in 2017 and was eventually paid \u2018seven figures\u2019.\n\nLauer has yet to comment on the allegations made in Catch and Kill.\n\nAt the time of the sexual harassment allegation against Lauer in 2017, the TV star \u2013 who worked for NBC for 23 years before he was sacked \u2013 said: \u2018There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have cause others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realise the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Some of what is being said about me is untrue or characterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.\n\n\u2018Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I\u2019m committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It\u2019s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Lauer\u2019s rep and NBC for comment.\n\nCatch and Kill by Ronan Farrow is out on 15 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
