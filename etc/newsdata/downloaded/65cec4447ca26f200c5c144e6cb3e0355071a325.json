Later this year, all the collaborators will kick into gear to see if the pilot\u2019s findings can be repeated across 21 labs in 19 countries. If they find the same results, will that be enough to convince even the skeptics that it\u2019s not just a fluke?\n\nWell \u2026 maybe. A study like Wagenmakers\u2019s sounds, in principle, like enough to lay a scientific question to rest, but it wasn\u2019t. A study like Coles\u2019s sounds like it could be definitive too, but it probably won\u2019t be. Even Big Science can\u2019t make science simple. \u201cI\u2019m still a little unsure, even though I\u2019ve now replicated the effects successfully in my own labs,\u201d said Coles. \u201cI\u2019ll hold my breath until the full data set comes in.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cathleen O'Grady", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Can-Smiling-Really-Make-You-Happier"], "top_image": ""}
