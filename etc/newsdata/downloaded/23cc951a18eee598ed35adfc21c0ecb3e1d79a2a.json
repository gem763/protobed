In the second half it was a wild game, they were running and we were running.\u201d\n\nKlopp was also unhappy about the penalty awarded to the home side after Robertson was adjudged to have fouled Callejon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I say, for me, it is clear and obvious no penalty. He jumps before any contact, we can\u2019t change that.\u201d\n\nNapoli\u2019s Hirving Lozano headed in from close range early on but the goal was correctly ruled out for offside, before Sadio Mane forced home keeper Alex Meret into a save and Roberto Firmino flashed a header wide before the break.\n\nLiverpool keeper Adrian denied Mertens with a superb reaction stop early in the second half before Meret dived to direct Mohamed Salah\u2019s effort wide.\n\nBut the late double from Mertens and Llorente secured the three points for Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side, who also beat Liverpool at home at the same stage last season.\n\n\u201cWe worked hard to defend and attack as a unit, because at times football means adapting to situations and I think we did it well,\u201d Ancelotti told Sky Sport Italia.\n\n\u201cWe felt confident on the second goal, it was near the end and we were a goal up. You can press high at times, not at others, it\u2019s about maintaining your identity and also being able to do everything. I liked our quality, but also how we played ugly when we needed to.\u201d\n\nIn the other Group E game, Salzburg made an impressive start with a 6-2 victory at home to Genk.\n\nErling Haaland scored a first-half hat-trick for the Austrian champions, becoming the third youngest player to net a Champions League treble at the age of 19 years and 58 days, behind Raul (18y 113d) and Wayne Rooney (18y 340d).", "description": "Juergen Klopp was frustrated by Liverpool\u2019s poor finishing after his side began their Champions League title defence with a 2-0 defeat away to Napoli, who scored two late goals at the Stadio San Paolo on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Alasdair Mackenzie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430984515&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1U2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
