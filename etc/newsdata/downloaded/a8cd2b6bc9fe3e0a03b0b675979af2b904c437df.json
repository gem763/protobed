(AP) - Los Angeles tight end Tyler Higbee will miss the Rams\u2019 game at Cleveland with a bruised chest.\n\nCoach Sean McVay announced the decision Friday.\n\nHigbee has never missed a game in his four-year NFL career, but he was hurt during last week\u2019s win at New Orleans. The chest injury left him coughing up blood, and he didn\u2019t participate in practice this week.\n\nHigbee agreed to a four-year contract extension earlier this month with $15.5 million guaranteed.\n\nGerald Everett is likely to get extensive playing time in Higbee\u2019s absence.\n\nStarting right guard Austin Blythe is still questionable for Sunday with a low left ankle sprain. Jamil Demby is expected to make his first career start if Blythe can\u2019t go.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Los Angeles tight end Tyler Higbee will miss the Rams' game at Cleveland with a bruised chest.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/saints_rams_football_95938_c0-183-4378-2735_s1770x1032.jpg?9ca00dfb8d0c4d100f2db7e3df90df5edbbaf215", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
