REUTERS/Melanie Burton/File Photo\n\nThe Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a small shareholder in BHP, the world\u2019s biggest listed miner, co-filed a resolution in September that recommended the company suspend its membership of such industry bodies.\n\nBut BHP said its board would recommend shareholders vote against the resolution at its annual general meetings because it was already reviewing its industry memberships and the policy positions taken by those groups since January 2018.\n\nBHP will hold its London AGM on Thursday next week and in Sydney on Nov. 7.\n\nNon-government organization ACCR said in a statement that a base of 27 investors would back its resolution, including the Californian superannuation fund CalPERS, AXA Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management and Aviva Investors.\n\nThis also includes the Church of England Pensions Board and top-five investor Aberdeen Asset Management, which said this week that they planned to support the resolution.\n\nIt was unclear what percentage of BHP shares the 27 investors held in total.\n\nBHP is trying to establish itself as a leader in climate-change management after Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie in July pledged to spend $400 million on curtailing emissions.\n\nIt also says it believes engagement can promote best practice. It funds several industry bodies, including the New South Wales Minerals Council of Australia, which has launched an advertising blitz in support of coal jobs in the state.\n\nThe NSW Minerals Council is rallying public support for an overhaul of state planning laws after the state\u2019s Independent Planning Commission blocked several coal projects, citing concerns over climate change.\n\nThe NSW council referred Reuters to its climate change policy, which says it supports a measured transition to a low-emissions economy including participation in global agreements such as the 2015 Paris accord.\n\nIt also says \u201csustained global action is required to reduce the risks of human-induced climate change\u201d.\n\nAustralia, among the world\u2019s largest per-capita carbon emitters, is also the world\u2019s largest coal exporter. New South Wales, where BHP\u2019s Mt Arthur thermal coal mine is located, is the second largest coal-producing state.", "description": "Investors representing A$8 trillion ($5.4 trillion) have backed a call for BHP to ditch funding for industry groups whose actions are inconsistent with the Paris climate agreement, an Australian NGO said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439214497&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990Q1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
