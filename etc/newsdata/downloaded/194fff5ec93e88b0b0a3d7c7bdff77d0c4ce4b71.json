A closed preliminary hearing on the corruption case is set to begin Friday.\n\nThe former president is also suspected of committing 13 other crimes including organisation of murder, organisation of mass disturbances and taking servicemen hostage during clashes at his residence this summer, his lawyer said.\n\nAtambayev is the president\u2019s former friend and was active in securing the incumbent\u2019s election victory in 2017.\n\nBut the two subsequently fell out, roiling the impoverished country\u2019s political elite.\n\nAtambayev, who hails from Kyrgyzstan\u2019s north, accused Jeenbekov of forming a \u201cfamily-clan regime\u201d along with other southern politicians.\n\nTheir standoff sparked clashes between Atambayev\u2019s supporters and security services in August.\n\nThe conflict between the two has been watched with apprehension in Russia and China, whose political and economic influence in the country deepened during Atambayev\u2019s rule.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin whose country has a military base in Kyrgyzstan met with Atambayev and Jeenbekov separately in Moscow in July.\n\nBut the Kremlin chief\u2019s intervention failed to defuse the conflict.\n\nIn August, Atambayev was detained in a joint police and special forces operation targeting his residence near the capital Bishkek.\n\nAn earlier raid on his compound was repulsed by armed supporters leading to the death of a special forces officer and prompting a murder investigation.\n\nAtambayev\u2019s arrest came after he ignored three police summonses for questioning in connection with the release of crime boss Aziz Batukayev.\n\n\u2013 Dogs and feasts \u2013\n\nBatukayev\u2019s release on medical grounds caused an uproar in Kyrgyzstan where influential crime bosses are often viewed as being able to strike deals with the leadership.\n\nLeaked photos from Batukayev\u2019s time in jail showed that the criminal enjoyed a more comfortable existence than his fellow inmates, holding feasts in his cell where he reportedly kept dogs and regularly hosted visitors.\n\nMedical documents that showed he suffered from terminal cancer and provided the basis for his release were later revealed as forgeries by investigators.\n\nAuthorities say they have been unable to secure Batukayev\u2019s extradition from Russia.\n\nAt least three other former officials including one former state prosecutor will also face trial over Batukayev\u2019s release.\n\nA number of other officials who were detained in connection with the case are believed to have testified against the former leader.\n\nAtambayev became Kyrgyzstan\u2019s first elected president to hand over power peacefully in 2017, following uprisings in 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe second revolution left nearly 100 people dead and saw authoritarian leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev flee to Belarus.\n\nThe Kyrgyz constitution now prohibits presidents from seeking a second term \u2014 a unique stipulation in a region where long-ruling strongmen are the norm, but one that stokes tensions around election time.", "description": "Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) (AFP) \u2013 Kyrgyz ex-president Almazbek Atambayev, who faces a litany of accusations including organisation of murder and unrest,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/543ffd_kyrgyz-president-almazbek-atambayev-was-charged-corruption-2013-release-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
