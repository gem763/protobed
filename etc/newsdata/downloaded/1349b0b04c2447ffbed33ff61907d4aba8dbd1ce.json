Police are supposed to be keepers of the peace, protectors of the people \u2014 not the root cause of the people's pain. Corrupt police have consistently killed black men in America. Police must not be the judge, jury and executioner that snuffs out the lives of black men. Eric Garner. Laquan McDonald. Walter Scott. Akai Gurley. Tamir Rice. Michael Brown. Philando Castile. John Crawford III. Freddie Gray. The horribly long list of black males who have been murdered by police goes on.\n\nPolice could have arrested some of these black men and let them have due process and their day in court. I have respected family members, friends and mentors who are, and have been, highly responsible police officers. They are cops who know, protect and serve the people in their communities.\n\nPolice did not shoot Dylann Storm Roof, a white man, after he shot nine black people to death at an African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina. This double standard must stop and this horrible decision should be appealed in memory of Antwon.\n\nPastor Arthur L. Mackey Jr.; Roosevelt, N.Y.\n\nPeople gather around a memorial drawing of Antwon Rose II who was fatally shot as he fled during a traffic stop. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar/AP)\n\nA former police officer in East Pittsburgh, a few stone's throws from where I grew up, claims he thought he saw a gun on Antwon, prompting him to fire three shots into the back, arm and face of the fleeing teenager last year.\n\nHe didn't have a gun.\n\nRegardless, the police officer was acquitted of murder charges, sparking widespread protests throughout the city. The police officer is white. The fleeing suspect was black. Was the fatal shooting racially motivated? It depends on who you ask.\n\nThere was closure following a different deadly shooting in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life synagogue, also in 2018. The assailant was captured and awaits justice. But no such luck for the family of Antwon, who received the death penalty because of what his exonerated executioner thought he saw.\n\nVin Morabito; Scranton, Pa.\n\nIf they spent as much time learning to de-escalate a situation as they do shooting, that could help. Impeaching a president that supports white supremacy would help too. My heart goes out to those that have lost loved ones in this race war. Not all of us are as blind. #iseeyou \u2014 PurrpleJasmin (@PurrpleJasmin) March 27, 2019\n\nI mean if you look up the case. The police officer pulled over a car Antwon Rose and a fellow teen were driving in which matched the description of a car in a earlier drive-by shooting. I guess you could say the cop was more nervous about being shot, this is kind of a tough spot. \u2014 DozerDallas (@Wesley66159628) March 26, 2019\n\nwe rarely hear stories about unarmed white teens getting shot because it doesn\u2019t happen as often. it starts with the fact that systematic and innate racism are still in the world today. even when people don\u2019t realize it, they can be discriminatory. thats the root of the problem. \u2014 zach el ghatit (@ZElghatit) March 26, 2019\n\nFacebook comments edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nOne of the stories about this incident says that \"Rose was riding in an unlicensed taxi that had been involved in a drive-by shooting.\" Why would anyone put themselves in that position in the first place? Is following the law just too much to ask these days? It's kind of inviting trouble one might venture to think.\n\n\u2014 Greg Hunder\n\nCop standard defense: He was black, he must be armed.\n\n\u2014 Chuck McAbee\n\nHe should've been convicted. Cops should only be allowed to shoot suspects who present an immediate threat of deadly force.\n\n\u2014 Josh Rivetz\n\nYes, conservatives think disobeying police instructions carries a mandatory death penalty, to be administered immediately. The fact that in case after case, an unarmed black man is shot while running away should show that police training and standards must change. Police killed a man who was not a danger to them. In so many cases police do not take sufficient time to assess the situation. A different weapon would give officers more time to better determine risk.\n\n\u2014 Dave Cawdell\n\nOnly the jury had the facts, we are all just reacting based on how we feel about the verdict. I don't know if this was the right call or not since this is the first I heard about the case, but I know that the news media has continued fueling racial tensions.\n\n\u2014 Michael Younger\n\nHow dare these protesters make Antwon a martyr. He passively sat by while someone in the vehicle he was riding in opened fire on two men, hitting one in the abdomen. Why aren't protesters wearing T-shirts with pictures of that man's face? Why aren't they chanting that man's name? How many of those protesters have shown support for that man's family? No, I'm not saying it's OK for officers to shoot someone in the back who is running away. I'm only saying not to make someone a martyr who hasn't earned the right to be one.\n\n\u2014 Charlie Jackson\n\nWant to sound off about what's happening with police?
