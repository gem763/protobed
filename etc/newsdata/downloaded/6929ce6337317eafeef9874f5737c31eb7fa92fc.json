For many circumstances, they [Liverpool] didn't drop points. It is better not to think one team is eight points ahead - it is only October.'\n\nPep Guardiola stated he had faith in his players to come back given it's still early in the season\n\nWolves' Adama Traore celebrates after putting his team in front late on at the Etihad Stadium\n\nSergio Aguero looks crestfallen after Wolves seal their victory with a second in added time\n\n'I know these guys. They are still incredibly involved and they can still do it.\n\n'It is a lot of points [difference]. But it is better not to think about that. It is better to think about what is next.\n\n'It was a bad day, that sometimes happens. We started quite well and then we conceded two situations with two loose balls in our build-up - we got a little bit nervous. That sometimes happens - there's a lot of games to go.'", "description": "The champions suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at home to an inspired Wolves at the Etihad, which makes the gap to leaders Liverpool eight points after the Reds' last-minute victory against Leicester.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19388638-0-image-a-30_1570441994549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
