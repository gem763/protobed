Then for good measure, he lambasted Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama, saying he'd only been considered a success \"because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass.\"\n\nOn Friday, Trump will take the \"Make America Great Again\" show to Louisiana.\n\n- Respite from DC troubles -\n\nDemocrats who have been accusing Trump of abusing his office throughout his first term believe they have finally cornered the president with an impeachment probe into his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nTrump allegedly pressured new Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky to open a corruption probe of Biden and his son.\n\nThe president has pushed back hard -- refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry -- and seeking to turn the entire scandal into a boost for his reelection campaign.\n\nPublic support for impeachment is slowly growing, with a new poll from Fox News -- a channel favored by US conservatives -- showing 51 percent now back his removal from office.\n\n\"Whoever their Pollster is, they suck,\" Trump responded on Twitter.\n\nWith control of the lower house of Congress, Democrats are likely to impeach in the coming months, even if few believe the Republican-led Senate will actually convict Trump and force him from office.\n\nHowever, Trump has faced a rare party rebellion this week over his abrupt decision to remove US troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, effectively abandoning Kurds who had fought alongside the United States in Syria to a Turkish assault.\n\nTrump argues that his now infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky did not feature any kind of pressure, but an innocent proposal for pursuing corruption.\n\nHe got a boost Thursday when Zelensky backed his version of events, telling journalists \"there was no blackmail.\"\n\nDemocrats say that given the vast power differential between the two leaders, Trump did not need to make explicit threats and that his request to Zelensky for \"a favor\" was enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden gave a blistering speech in which he called for impeachment, accusing Trump of \"shooting holes in the constitution.\"\n\nOn Thursday, two Florida-based businessmen linked to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani -- who is at the heart of the controversy -- were arrested over alleged campaign finance violations.\n\nThe pair, Americans born in Ukraine and Belarus, were accused of funneling foreign funds to US political campaigns, including $325,000 which went to a fundraising committee for Trump's 2020 reelection.\n\nTrump, who has been photographed with both men, said he had no idea who they were. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do. I don't know,\" he told reporters.", "description": "An angry, energized President Donald Trump whipped supporters into a frenzy Thursday at a Minneapolis campaign rally where he predicted a 2020 election \"backlash\" against Democratic attempts to impeach him.
