They would have probably killed her, if not for Negan who steps in heroically and rescues her. Unfortunately for Negan, Margo, one of the bullies that he throws against the wall, ends up dead.\n\nThe others quickly show up and see what Negan did.\n\nThey end up capturing him, despite Lydia\u2019s claim that he was just protecting her.\n\nNaturally, the whole town thinks Negan is guilty of killing an innocent girl and wants to execute him, saying they should have done that a long time ago. Others, mainly Daryl, believe Lydia.\n\nNegan is put back in prison where he waits for a trial, but not for long as he escapes during the night. Lydia says it was her who freed Negan, but Daryl doesn\u2019t believe her as he was watching her all night.\n\nA theory on who let Negan out of prison\n\nSo if Lydia didn\u2019t free Negan, who did?\n\nIt seems \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d is leaving this intentionally a mystery.\n\nAccording to Forbes, what is happening is that \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d is merging show and comic plotlines rather brilliantly.\n\nWarning: Comic book spoilers ahead, stop reading if you don\u2019t want to know what could happen.\n\nIn the comic, a boy that holds a grudge against Rick Grimes helps Negan escape.\n\nNegan is then wandering the woods for a while until he allies himself with the Whisperers.\n\nBut even Negan is disgusted by their way of living and he ends up chopping Alpha\u2019s head off and returns to Alexandria with her head as a trophy.\n\nAccording to Paul Tassi from Forbes, things might go different in the show. He believes Negan was let out of the prison by none other than Carol. Not only that, but she also sends him on the mission to infiltrate the Whisperers and kill Alpha.\n\nWho Is Negan\u2019s Secret Savior On \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019? via @forbes https://t.co/d2UkWGXCPZ \u2014 Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) October 28, 2019\n\nAfter All, Carol wants Alpha dead more than anyone for what she did to Henry.\n\nOne of the last shot of the episode shows Carol on the rooftop with a map. This could imply that she was the one who let Negan out and ordered him to infiltrate the Whisperers\u2019 camp and kill their leader.\n\nSo if Negan does indeed kill Alpha, we get Negan\u2019s comic storyline and Carol getting her revenge by proxy.", "description": "According to Forbes, Carol let Negan out of prison and instructed him to kill Alpha.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Nigel Payne", "Susan B.", "Read More On The Same Topic Milos Kitanovic", "'This Is Us' Season Episode", "Theories About The Mark", "Kate Mystery", "'The Walking Dead' Season", "Episode"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/28/os/b_1200x630/negan-escapes-prison-image-source-daryl-dixonyoutube_2346011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
