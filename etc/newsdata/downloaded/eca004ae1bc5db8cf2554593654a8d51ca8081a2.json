They are not agile and climbing ashore across steep coastal land forms will be difficult.'\n\n'For breeding, they depend upon sea ice, and in a warming world there is a high probability that this will decrease. Without it, they will have little or no breeding habitat.'\n\nYesterday the British Antarctic Survey warned that more than half of the birds \u2014 at least 300,000 \u2014 will die under current rates of temperature rise\n\nPeter Fretwell, BAS remote sensing expert and paper co-author said: 'Some colonies of emperor penguins may not survive the coming decades, so we must work to give as much protection as we can to the species to give them the best chance.'\n\nRod Downie, Chief Polar Adviser at WWF, which funded the study, said: 'Emperor penguins are perfectly adapted to survive in the most remote and extreme frontier of our planet.'\n\n'But even they cannot hide from the global climate crisis as they lose the sea ice from beneath their feet.'\n\n'We need to take urgent action to protect this incredible species through the creation of vast marine protected areas and rapid and deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.'", "description": "Experts reviewed more than 150 studies on the Antarctic-dwelling species.
