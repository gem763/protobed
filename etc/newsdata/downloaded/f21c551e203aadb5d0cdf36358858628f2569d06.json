But the good news is when the S &P 500 has been up more than 15 per cent for the year heading into the usually bullish fourth quarter, the returns actually became stronger during the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIn fact, since WWII this has happened 17 times,\" Mr Detrick said. \"The fourth quarter was in the green 15 times with a median return of a very impressive 4.6 per cent.\u201d\n\nNeutral sentiment steady, bearish sentiment leaps\n\nNeutral sentiment, expectations that stock prices will stay essentially unchanged over the next six months, rose 1.8 percentage points to 39.2 per cent. Neutral sentiment was last at this level on May 22, 2019.\n\nAs for bearish sentiment, expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, it leapt 6.2 percentage points to 39.4 per cent. Pessimism remains above its historical average of 30.5 per cent for the ninth time in 11 weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBullish sentiment is back at an unusually low level for the first time in five weeks. Historically, such readings have been followed by higher-than-average and higher-than-median six- and 12-month S &P 500 index returns.\n\nNeutral and bearish sentiment are within but near the upper end of their respective typical ranges, the association said.\n\nThis week\u2019s drop in bullish sentiment follows the return of downside volatility to the stock market and weaker-than-expected economic reports.\n\nMany individual investors have been monitoring trade negotiations, particularly between the US and China, the association also said.\n\nAlso having an influence on sentiment are Washington politics, geopolitics, valuations, corporate earnings, monetary policy and interest rates.", "description": "The bull market is running low on bullish sentiment, according to the latest survey by the American Association of Individual Investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8856%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_231%2C$y_297/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/28238750634eadfa4206f274c0cbc31940989ec1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
