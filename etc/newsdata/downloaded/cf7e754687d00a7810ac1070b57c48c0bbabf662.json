But sunshine quickly pushes temperatures from the 40s and 50s to near 70 by the early afternoon, with mid- to late-afternoon highs in the low to mid-70s. There\u2019s little in the way of wind, and a few high clouds may increase by late afternoon. Confidence: High\n\nTomorrow night: High clouds increase in the evening, but conditions look good for the Nationals game as temperatures fall back through the 60s. Clouds lower and thicken with a small chance of light rain toward morning. Lows range from the low to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nAn area of storminess forms along a cold front passing through the region on Wednesday, likely producing some substantial rainfall. The best chance of rain is between late morning and late afternoon, although this timing could shift. The clouds and rain cap temperatures in the mid-60s or so. It becomes windy by the late afternoon and especially at night, when rain subsides and skies gradually clear. Lows Wednesday night dip into the 40s in most spots. Confidence: Medium\n\nWe dry out Thursday and Friday but it\u2019s a bit brisk \u2014 the coolest weather of the fall so far. Highs are only in the low to mid-60s both days and, on Thursday, it\u2019s rather windy as Wednesday\u2019s storm winds up over New England. Thursday night is particularly chilly, as lows dip into the mid-40s downtown with some upper 30s in our colder spots. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nThe weekend looks marvelous. After a cold start to Saturday (in the 40s in most spots), we rebound to near 70 under mostly sunny skies. Sunday also begins on the crisp side (40s to low 50s), but 75 is possible during the afternoon.
