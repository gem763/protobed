Why is it always back, where\u2019s my turtle coffee, where\u2019s my white chocolate mocha??\n\n\u2018Those popcorn chicken things they had??? [sic].\u2019\n\nOthers were upset that the product isn\u2019t available in more of the chain\u2019s stores.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve lived on this earth for 20 god damn years and never had a chance to taste the forbidden fruit,\u2019 wrote one person.\n\nHowever, as always, there are those who are ecstatic at the prospect of once again getting their hands on the saucy goodness.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S MCRIB SEASON!!!!!,\u2019 tweeted one person.\n\nSomeone else said: \u2018Omg- the #McRib is coming back, I can\u2019t wait.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, for the big question: will it be brought back to the UK, too? We asked McDonald\u2019s but unfortunately there appears to be no plans in place for it to be re-launched here.\n\nYou could always buy some ribs and chuck it between two burger buns?\n\nMORE: Confectionery company is hiring a professional fudge taste-tester\n\nMORE: BrewDog launches a 50% beef, 50% vegan burger and it\u2019s got people talking\n\nMORE: Taco Bell is giving out free Doritos Locos Tacos in the UK on Friday\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The popular item was last sold in the UK in 2014 for a limited amount of weeks, and has now returned on menus - but only in the US.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88381812_1570206330.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
