It is lucky we're not residing there.'\n\nThe phenomenon, known as a Seyfert flare, created two enormous 'ionisation cones' that sliced through the galaxy.\n\nWhat is the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* The Galactic centre of the Milky Way is dominated by one resident, the supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Supermassive black holes are incredibly dense areas in the centre of galaxies with masses that can be billions of times that of the sun. They act as intense sources of gravity which hoover up dust and gas around them. Evidence of a black hole at the centre of our galaxy was first presented by physicist Karl Jansky in 1931, when he discovered radio waves coming from the region. Pre-eminent yet invisible, Sgr A* has the mass equivalent to some four million suns. At just 26,000 light years from Earth, Sgr A* is one of very few black holes in the universe where we can actually witness the flow of matter nearby. Less than one per cent of the material initially within the black hole\u2019s gravitational influence reaches the event horizon, or point of no return, because much of it is ejected. Consequently, the X-ray emission from material near Sgr A* is remarkably faint, like that of most of the giant black holes in galaxies in the nearby universe. The captured material needs to lose heat and angular momentum before being able to plunge into the black hole. The ejection of matter allows this loss to occur.\n\nThey began with a relatively small diameter close to the black hole - expanding vastly as they exited into inter galactic space.\n\nThe blue flare was so powerful it impacted on the Magellanic Stream - a long tidal tail of gas that extends half way around the Milky Way and lies 200,000 light years from it.\n\nThe explosion was too huge to have been triggered by anything other than nuclear activity associated with the black hole, say the researchers.\n\nNamed Sagittarius A, or Sgr A*, it is about 4.2million times more massive than the Sun.\n\nOrbited by a swarm of stars, it has been known about for decades. Evidence has been building of a real cataclysm in the past.\n\nUsing data gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope, Professor Bland-Hawthorn and colleagues estimated the blast lasted for perhaps 300,000 years.\n\nThis is an extremely short period in galactic terms, said Prof Bland Hawthorn whose findings are to be published in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe paper follows research reported by the same team in 2013 that first suggested SgrA* has sporadically burst into life.\n\nCo author Dr Magda Guglielmo, also of the University of Sydney, said: 'These results dramatically change our understanding of the Milky Way.\n\n'We always thought about our Galaxy as an inactive galaxy, with a not so bright centre.\n\n'These new results instead open the possibility of a complete reinterpretation of its evolution and nature.\n\n'The flare event that occurred 3.5 million years ago was so powerful it had consequences on the surrounding of our galaxy. We are the witness to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.'\n\nThe latest work firms up SgrA* as the prime suspect in the spectacular explosion. But how black holes evolve, influence and interact with galaxies 'is an outstanding problem in astrophysics,' added the researchers.\n\nBlack holes are some of the strangest objects in the universe.\n\nThey are the power stations of galaxies, shaping them with powerful winds that sweep away inter galactic matter.\n\nEven light cannot escape. That is why we cannot see them directly. We only know they exist from the odd behaviour of the stuff near them.\n\nFor example, gases swirl around them at nearly the speed of light, giving off lots of high energy radiation.\n\nRecent research has also suggested the radiation they emit also has the potential for sustaining life - and can even facilitate photosynthesis.", "description": "The nuclear blast was so big its impact was felt 200,000 light years away, scientists in Australia say.
