We were quoting $3-$3.3 million and we had a lot of interest at the upper end of the range.\u201d\n\nMr Rigopoulos said the buyer, who would live in the house with her daughter, had wanted to make sure she was ahead of the competition so \u201cdug deep\u201d and finished on the quirky figure.\n\nHe said past experiences with sales that had \u201creally come down to the wire\u201d and potential buyers having regrets meant offering \u201cmore favourable terms, a better deposit amount or maybe $50 (extra) to go that extra stretch\u201d could be a clever strategy for buyers.\n\n\u201cNot only does it create some sort of gap, it also demonstrates to the vendors that you\u2019ve given it your best shot and done what you can.\u201d\n\nThe five-bedroom Bayview St house was transformed and sold by the BuildHer Collective, a company that teaches women how to build that also has its own projects.\n\nMr Rigopoulos said the collective\u2019s philosophy was to create homes as you would want to live in them yourself, rather than just to sell, such as including things like a void or extra fixtures \u201cthat might worry traditional builders but excite owner occupiers\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey sharpen the saw themselves by keeping active with their own projects. It\u2019s a great example of what they teach, and they practice what they preach,\u201d he said.\n\nCoreLogic records show the company paid $3 million for the property in 2016.\n\nIts October 1, 2019 sale price, the top Melbourne result of that week, elevates it into the top handful of house sales in Northcote, with the quality and well thought-out design drawcards.\n\nThe suburb record was set by 18 Henry St at $4.465 million in June.\n\nMORE: Small Dandenong house towered over by neighbours has big price\n\nPaul Hecker\u2019s Home Truths: \u2018I rented the broom closet off the kitchen\u2019\n\nEmulation Hall: Egypt style for sale in Canterbury at old Masonic hall\n\nscott.carbines@news.com.au", "description": "Settling on a \u201cbest and final\u201d private sale offer is stressful \u2014 especially when you\u2019re emotionally invested.
