(Fabrice Seixas/Courtesy of artist, Lee Ufan/Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Gallery)\n\nMonday, Sept. 23\n\n\u2018In Mid-Sentence\u2019 at the National Portrait Gallery: The concept of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition \u201cIn Mid-Sentence\u201d is right there in the title. The show features 26 photographs that depict people caught in the act of speaking, whether to an acquaintance or to the nation. But the pictures, all from the museum\u2019s holdings, are linked by a lot more than that. All the photos are in black and white, and although their dates range from 1936 to 1987, nearly all are from the 1950s or \u201960s. Most are news photos of famous people, including politicians, activists, artists, athletes and astronauts. Through March 8. Free.\n\n[This photo exhibition captures people in the act of speaking \u2014 during a less self-conscious time]\n\nHand Habits at 9:30 Club: Before making waves with Hand Habits, Meg Duffy\u2019s woozying guitar riffs and gentle vocals had already caught the ears of some high-profile collaborators. Duffy played a memorable slide-guitar solo on the War on Drugs\u2019 Grammy-winning album \u201cA Deeper Understanding\u201d and was, until recently, a longtime fixture in folk-rocker Kevin Morby\u2019s backing band. On \u201cPlaceholder,\u201d Duffy\u2019s second album as Hand Habits, the 28-year-old forges a path by flexing a knack for intimate melodies that evoke pastoral Americana. These softer tunes can melt into the background, but a closer examination reveals Duffy wrestling with currents of grief and anxiety. 7 p.m. $30.\n\nTuesday, Sept. 24\n\n\u2018The New One\u2019 at National Theatre: Mike Birbiglia has done a lot of growing up since he wrote \u201cThe New One,\u201d his latest one-man show reflecting on his fear of first-time fatherhood. The 41-year-old comedian jokes in the show that the bond between his wife, poet Jennifer Hope Stein, and newborn daughter, Oona, was \u201cso profound \u2014 and I was there, too.\u201d In another self-deprecating barb, he refers to himself as the \u201cpudgy, milkless vice president of the family.\u201d \u201cIt was a period of time when I felt completely isolated and alone,\u201d Birbiglia says. \u201cI really had this distinct fear that I would never be a member of this beautiful family. I was on the outside looking at it through a window.\u201d Through Sunday. $39-$114.\n\nInjury Reserve at Milkboy ArtHouse: Injury Reserve defies categorization. With 2015\u2019s \u201cLive from the Dentist Office\u201d \u2014 a mix tape recorded in the dentist\u2019s office belonging to one member\u2019s grand\u00adfather \u2014 the Arizona trio seemed to be giving their own modern spin on sample-based jazz rap popularized by A Tribe Called Quest a generation earlier. But quickly, they would chafe at that description. \u201cI say this ain\u2019t jazz-rap, this that, this that spazz-rap, this that raised-by-the-Internet, ain\u2019t-had-no-dad rap,\u201d Ritchie With a T clarified on their next album. Whatever you call it, expect lopsided beats and left-field lyricism as Injury Reserve finds new stones to overturn. 8 p.m. $16-$18.\n\n\u2018Escaped Alone\u2019 at Signature Theatre: Afternoon tea time quickly takes on sinister overtones in \u201cEscaped Alone,\u201d which begins with a casual shoot-the-breeze session among older ladies in a garden. British playwright Caryl Churchill\u2019s darkly funny piece dabbles in scenes of apocalypse, horror and dystopia, as three friends invite a neighbor to join their conversation. Prolific Washington actress Holly Twyford directs the Washington premiere of this one-act play at Signature Theatre. Showtimes vary through Nov. 3. $40-$90.\n\nKoffee at Echostage: Just about two years ago, Mikayla \u201cKoffee\u201d Simpson had her first brush with fame when \u201cLegend,\u201d a simple vocal-and-acoustic tribute to Usain Bolt, went viral after the sprinter posted it to his Instagram. Since then, the 19-year-old \u201csingjay\u201d \u2014 the Jamaican term for a combination singer-DJ who croons and toasts \u2014 has turned her 15 minutes into the beginnings of a career. Her style mixes reggae with dance hall, as on her single \u201cToast,\u201d which celebrates life\u2019s blessings over an inescapable beat. With Rihanna\u2019s rumored reggae album nowhere in sight, Koffee is ready to be pon de replay. 8 p.m. Sold out.\n\nWednesday, Sept. 25\n\nTaste of Uptown at various locations: Wednesday night offers up a chance to sample around one of the tastiest stretches of the District. Start your journey of 14th and Kennedy streets NW at one of five check-in locations, including the dynamite pinball bar Lyman\u2019s Tavern and the charmingly hospitable Moreland\u2019s Tavern. Then set out on your own path to snack from other standout eateries such as Little Coco\u2019s or Jackie Lee\u2019s, which have superb Italian dishes and outstanding drinks, respectively. 5 to 9 p.m. $5-$40.\n\n[This block has the best cheap eats and drinks in D.C.]\n\nThursday, Sept. 26\n\nMadlib at U Street Music Hall: Madlib is hip-hop\u2019s preeminent cratedigger, at one point accumulating more than 8,000 pounds of vinyl records. All those records aren\u2019t just for collecting or playing: The producer-DJ-rapper is also hip-hop\u2019s preeminent sampler, building a new world of music from minuscule bits of the past. He\u2019s done it in every configuration imaginable, crafting beats for his helium-voiced alter ego Quasimoto, his instrumental \u201cBeat Konducta\u201d series and classic collaborative efforts with such underground rap heroes as MF Doom and J Dilla. In recent years, his lyrical muse has been Freddie Gibbs, who is, fittingly, rap\u2019s preeminent gangster rapper. 10 p.m. $20-$35.\n\nBob Mould at City Winery: Certain songs have been on Bob Mould\u2019s mind recently as he prepares for a solo tour behind his 13th solo album, \u201cSunshine Rock.\u201d The record splits the difference between the more aggressive \u201980s punk of Husker Du and Sugar\u2019s poppier sensibilities (particularly 1992\u2019s jangly \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Change Your Mind\u201d). It also finds Mould embracing a more positive mind-set after a few albums featuring darker lyrics. 8 p.m. $35-$45.\n\n[With \u2018Sunshine Rock,\u2019 a brighter outlook for alt rocker Bob Mould]\n\nFriday, Sept. 27\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates at the Lincoln Theatre: After winning a National Book Award for \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d and garnering a huge legion of fans for his essays and cultural criticism, Ta-Nehisi Coates is turning his attention to fiction. Coates embarks on a book tour this fall to discuss his debut novel, \u201cThe Water Dancer,\u201d with two nights at the Lincoln Theatre. The epic story (to be released Tuesday) begins with Hiram Walker, a boy blessed with a magical gift who is born into slavery on a Virginia plantation. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. $45.\n\n\u2018Lee Ufan: Open Dimension\u2019 at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: For the first time in its 45-year history, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is turning over almost all 4.3 acres of its outdoor plaza to a single artist. Lee Ufan \u2014 an 83-year-old Korean artist who is known for installations that call attention to empty space as much as to themselves \u2014 will showcase 10 site-responsive sculptural works. Using a combination of natural objects (e.g., stone) and human-made materials (e.g., steel), the show will be his largest single outdoor installation in the United States to date. Through Sept. 13, 2020. Free.\n\nBlisspop Disco Fest at 9:30 Club and U Street Music Hall: In recent years, EDM has reigned supreme on mainstream radio, but disco has had a quiet but steady resurgence thanks to a new generation of musicians. These key players \u2014 plus other notable names in dance music \u2014 will come together for the second installation of Blisspop Disco Fest. Among the buzzy headliners set to perform at 9:30 Club and U Street Music Hall are Kentucky producer and activist the Black Madonna and electro-funk duo Chromeo (who will play a DJ set). There\u2019s also a good reason to get to the shows early: The schedule is brimming with superb local talent. Catch Sam \u201cThe Man\u201d Burns, Eau Claire and more regional acts while you\u2019re dancing the night away. Various times. $20-$60.\n\nGo West Beer Fest at Eastern Market: One of the year\u2019s most interesting beer events is put on by the state societies of the Northwest. A ticket gets you samples of breweries that don\u2019t often show up around these parts. Seven states are accounted for, including Montana\u2019s Highlander Beer and Wyoming\u2019s Roadhouse Brewing. A portion of proceeds from ticket sales go toward the Boise, Idaho-based Wildland Firefighter Foundation. 6 to 10 p.m. $35-$40.\n\n\u2014 Hau Chu, Adele Chapin, Thomas Floyd, Rudi Greenberg, Chris Kelly, Michael O\u2019Sullivan and Stephanie Williams", "description": "Catch a new outdoor sculpture exhibition at the Hirshhorn, a disco festival and a tasting tour of uptown D.C.", "authors": ["Going Out Guide Staff", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0XPNQXoy5c_gYuKmCUxAbkOnr8s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S7DNOVWLOYI6TPQF65VMJ3DBRQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
