Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said on Monday that an additional round of tariffs on Chinese imports will likely be imposed if a trade deal with China has not been reached by the time they are set to start, but added that he expected the agreement to go through. said the partial deal between the world's two largest economies appeared to lack substance with limited progress on structural issues such as technology transfers.\n\nManuel Oliveri, an analyst at Credit Agricole (PA: ), said the announcements so far did not amount to \"a broad-based trade deal\" that would justify last week's market optimism.\n\nThe against a basket of six major currencies gained 0.20 percent to 98.501, up from a three-week low of 98.197 reached on Friday.\n\nTrading volumes are likely lighter than usual with Tokyo's market closed for a public holiday and a holiday in the United States for Columbus Day.\n\nEmerging market currencies and those closely linked to broad risk sentiment, such as the Australian dollar and Swedish crown, slipped, after rallying at the end of last week.\n\nSterling also dropped against both the dollar and euro , EURGBP= after Britain and the EU stressed over the weekend that there was a long way to go before they could agree a Brexit deal. surged late last week after London and Brussels announced \"intense\" negotiations to try and agree a Brexit deal before Oct. 31.\n\nCurrency bid prices at 9:27AM (1327 GMT) Description\n\nU.S. Close Pct Change\n\nYTD Pct\n\nHigh Bid\n\nLow Bid\n\nPrevious\n\nChange\n\nSession\n\nEuro/Dollar\n\n$1.1020\n\n$1.1040\n\n-0.18%\n\n-3.91%\n\n+1.1048\n\n+1.1014 Dollar/Yen\n\n108.3100\n\n108.4000\n\n-0.08%\n\n-1.77%\n\n+108.5200 +108.0500 Euro/Yen\n\nEURJPY=\n\n119.38\n\n119.62\n\n-0.20%\n\n-5.42%\n\n+119.6900 +119.2000 Dollar/Swiss\n\n0.9964\n\n0.9965\n\n-0.01%\n\n+1.54%\n\n+0.9983\n\n+0.9945 Sterling/Dollar GBP=\n\n1.2577\n\n1.2647\n\n-0.55%\n\n-1.41%\n\n+1.2653\n\n+1.2518 Dollar/Canadian CAD=\n\n1.3225\n\n1.3196\n\n+0.22%\n\n-3.02%\n\n+1.3227\n\n+1.3192 Australian/Doll AUD=\n\n0.6750\n\n0.6787\n\n-0.55%\n\n-4.26%\n\n+0.6801\n\n+0.6752 ar\n\nEuro/Swiss\n\nEURCHF=\n\n1.0983\n\n1.0998\n\n-0.14%\n\n-2.41%\n\n+1.1010\n\n+1.0972 Euro/Sterling\n\nEURGBP=\n\n0.8762\n\n0.8729\n\n+0.38%\n\n-2.47%\n\n+0.8811\n\n+0.8726 NZ\n\n0.6280\n\n0.6336\n\n-0.88%\n\n-6.51%\n\n+0.6335\n\n+0.6282 Dollar/Dollar\n\nDollar/Norway\n\n9.1207\n\n9.0791\n\n+0.46%\n\n+5.58%\n\n+9.1239\n\n+9.0738 Euro/Norway\n\nEURNOK=\n\n10.0529\n\n10.0187\n\n+0.34%\n\n+1.48%\n\n+10.0707\n\n+10.0161 Dollar/Sweden\n\n9.8333\n\n9.8029\n\n+0.16%\n\n+9.70%\n\n+9.8608\n\n+9.8045 Euro/Sweden\n\nEURSEK=\n\n10.8384\n\n10.8213\n\n+0.16%\n\n+5.60%\n\n+10.8670\n\n+10.8183", "description": "Safe havens gain as U.S.-China trade deal hopes ebb", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC2L0GX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
