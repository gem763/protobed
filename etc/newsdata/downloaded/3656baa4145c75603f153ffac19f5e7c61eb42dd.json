Legal products are less likely to contain the \u201ctoxic chemicals\u201d that appear to be causing the lung injuries, so sales may begin to climb again if fearful consumers turn from the illicit to the legal market.\n\n\u201cWe could see vapor pen sales increase if consumers in adult-use states move their purchases from the black market and into licensed dispensaries where they can be confident they will be able to purchase fully regulated and tested products,\u201d Headset said in its report.\n\nInterestingly, sales of dried flower haven\u2019t benefited much from the decline in vape demand. In fact, flower\u2019s market share in Nevada actually fell in September, while it was more or less flat in California and Washington.\n\nOther categories seem to be growing instead, with pre-roll sales up 8% in Washington and edibles sales up 9% in California in recent weeks, according to Headset.\n\nIn Canada, where cannabis vape devices won\u2019t be legally available until Dec. 16, one vaping-related illness has been confirmed. The government will \u201cestablish several regulatory controls for this category of products to help lower risks and better safeguard the health of Canadian consumers and to enable Health Canada to respond to emerging health issues in a timely manner,\u201d according to the department responsible for cannabis regulations.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Cannabis Industry Association last week urged the federal government to take a similar regulatory approach by removing cannabis from its list of controlled substances and treating it in a manner similar to alcohol, while also making funds available to state medical authorities so they can investigate the illnesses.\n\nIn a letter signed by about 800 cannabis executives, policy experts and advocates, the NCIA also called on consumers to immediately stop using illicit-market vape cartridges.\n\n\u201cIf it is confirmed that Americans are being hurt because of unregulated, illicit market cannabis vape products, it is yet another reason for real, comprehensive federal cannabis reform that will allow the regulated, tested cannabis industry to displace illicit market actors,\u201d the NCIA wrote in the letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. \u201cLives are literally at stake.\u201d", "description": "Sales of legal pot vapes have stabilised in key US states even as the number of injuries related to the device has topped 1 000 and a growing list of jurisdictions seek bans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8434/6b333b0287fb41dbb1d67ca245f7c17e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
