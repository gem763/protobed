(Concierge Auctions)\n\nPhilip Dobson, project sales manager with Concierge Auctions, said he couldn't speak to the seller but said the home is still in the Shaw family.\n\nHe said there's been a lot of interest in what is \"one of the best properties in Calgary.\"\n\n\"I think the opportunity is special on it's own in that it's going to a no reserve auction, meaning that there's no minimum bid, that it's going to be sold to the highest bidder regardless of price,\" said Dobson.\n\nThe home, which sits on a half-acre lot, is owned by the Shaw family. (Concierge Auctions)\n\n\"Finding a buyer of that magnitude is a very challenging thing to do. You see it all over the country with homes that are up there that are very unique, one of a kind that are really hard to find a compatible buyer for in the market.\"\n\nA $100,000 bidder deposit is required.\n\nThe six bedroom, five bathroom, three powder room, 9,808-sq.ft. mansion overlooks downtown from a ridge above the Bow River.\n\nThe home has six bedrooms, multiple fireplaces and a three-door garage. (Concierge Auctions)\n\nIt has a curving staircase underneath a glass dome inspired by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum in New York City, rooftop hot tub, glass-walled wine cellar, gym, library and movie room.\n\nBidding opens online on Nov. 12, but for those who want to get a glimpse of luxury, open house tours are available by appointment.\n\nThe home has five bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. (Concierge Auctions)\n\nIf you do happen to be shopping for luxury property right now (lucky you), there's good news \u2014 it's a buyer's market.\n\nA report released by Sotheby's last month predicted Calgary's luxury real estate market is likely to lag behind for some time, given the city's fragile economic recovery.\n\nSales of homes valued at more than $1 million dipped 21 per cent year-over-year in the first half of 2019, according to the company's fall report.", "description": "One of the most expensive luxury homes in Calgary is up for auction with no reserve.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320069.1570996111!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shaw-home-crescent-road.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
