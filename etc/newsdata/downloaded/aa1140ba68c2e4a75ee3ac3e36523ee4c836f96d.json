They have opposed all three Fed rate cuts this year as unnecessary.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a news conference following the Oct. 29-30 Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, U.S., October 30, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who had dissented in September because he supported a bigger rate cut then, voted with the majority on Wednesday, an indication that views within the Fed may be coalescing around standing pat for now.\n\nThe rate cut was widely anticipated by financial markets, but expectations for additional cuts after October have diminished significantly in recent weeks. Contracts tied to the Federal Funds rate indicate an expectation of perhaps one rate cut next year.\n\nWhile yields on longer-dated bonds showed little reaction, those on shorter-dated maturities that are more closely influenced by Fed policy expectations initially moved higher. The yield on the 2-year note US2YT=RR rose to the highest since Oct. 1 at about 1.67% before settling back to earlier levels as Powell spoke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much what was expected,\u201d said Jim Powers, director of investment research at Delegate Advisors.\n\n\u201cThe more important outcome is they removed the phrase \u2018act as appropriate.\u2019 It looks like the market is taking that to mean that there will be a pause in the declining rate path they were on beforehand. That\u2019s what was expected, and that\u2019s generally a good thing,\u201d Powers said.\n\nUNUSUAL JUNCTURE\n\nThe central bank and U.S. economy are at an unusual juncture.\n\nUnemployment is near a 50-year low, inflation is moderate, and data earlier on Wednesday showed economic growth in the third quarter slowed but not as sharply as many economists expected and some Fed officials feared.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBut parts of the economy, particularly manufacturing, have stuttered in recent months as the global economy slowed. Businesses have pared investment in response to the U.S.-China trade war that both raised tariffs on many goods, and also made the world a riskier place to make long-term commitments.\n\nWhile that has not had an obvious impact yet on U.S. hiring or consumer spending, Fed officials felt a round of \u201cinsurance\u201d rate cuts was appropriate to guard against a worse outcome. The Fed cut rates in July and again in September, and by doing so hoped to encourage businesses and consumers with more affordable borrowing costs.\n\nThe approach was successful in the 1990s when risks developed during another prolonged period of economic growth.", "description": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates for the third time this year to help sustain U.S. growth despite a slowdown in other parts of the world, but signaled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446641461&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1RZ", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
