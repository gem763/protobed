CTF staff members worked closely with Tory MPs \u2013 including some current ministers \u2013 to undermine Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, while several senior employees took leave to run Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign.\n\nThe Guardian has exposed CTF\u2019s work on campaigns for the Saudi Arabian government, major fossil fuel producers, anti-cycling campaigners, tobacco firms and sugary drinks producers. Now the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists has used, for only the fourth time, its powers to formally demand CTF Partners provide detailed evidence that the aims of such clients did not influence staff\u2019s unpaid work with politicians including the PM. Crosby\u2019s company has denied claims it could have broken the law, insisting senior employees\u2019 decision to volunteer on Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign was unconnected with their day jobs. But the investigation could be an incentive for Downing Street to keep Johnson away from his longtime political adviser Crosby. There are reports the pair have fallen out, with Johnson turning instead to his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his own partner, Carrie Symonds.\n\nTrump isolated amid Syria chaos \u2013 The Turkish defence ministry has declared \u201call preparations for a possible military operation into north-eastern Syria are completed\u201d, as Donald Trump faces a political backlash from close Republican allies after his decision to withdraw forces from the countries\u2019 border. The president is accused of betraying Kurdish fighters who led the defeat of Isis and leaving them to face a potential Turkish invasion alone. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have said the fate of tens of thousands of suspected Islamic State fighters and their families in its custody is uncertain. It is unclear if Turkey would take custody of them. In Washington the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that Isis and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d The Republican senator and Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham said: \u201cThis decision to abandon our Kurdish allies and turn Syria over to Russia, Iran and Turkey will put every radical Islamist on steroids. Shot in the arm to the bad guys. Devastating for the good guys.\u201d\n\nBrexit debt warning \u2013 Emergency tax cuts and higher public spending needed to offset a no-deal Brexit would send government debt to its highest level in more than half a century and could end up forcing a new wave of austerity cuts even as the government moves to increases funding for healthcare, schools and police, according to Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances. In a warning to Boris Johnson as his Brexit plan faces stiff opposition at home and abroad, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said government borrowing was already set to more than double in 2020, hard Brexit or not. Leaked EU papers obtained by the Guardian show how Brussels cut Boris Johnson\u2019s Irish border plan to pieces, point by point. This morning Amelia Gentleman tells the story of EU citizens in the UK, some of whom have been residents for 50 years but are now struggling to complete requirements to be allowed to stay.\n\nRebellion far from extinguished \u2013 About 280 people have been arrested after Extinction Rebellion protesters descended on London to begin a two-week blockade. They included Sarah Lasenby, an 81-year-old retired social worker from Oxford, and Phil Kingston, 83, who was arrested at the Treasury for spray-painting \u201cLife, not death for my grandchildren\u201d in red.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Extinction Rebellion protesters in the guise of Boris Johnson and the four riders of the apocalypse come up Whitehall.

Officers removed a man who had attached himself to a tipi frame on Westminster Bridge, while others who had glued themselves to scaffolding in Trafalgar Square were taken away. Boris Johnson derided the protesters as \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d who should stop blocking the streets of the capital with their \u201cheaving hemp-smelling bivouacs\u201d. At the launch of a Telegraph editor\u2019s book about Margaret Thatcher, the PM reportedly taunted protesters that his predecessor had cared about greenhouse gases before they did.\n\nCelebration and grief \u2013 A touring replica of Captain James Cook\u2019s Endeavour has docked in Gisborne 250 years after the British navigator landed in New Zealand and named the cove he first sighted Poverty Bay. At least one town has banned the ship from docking amid outcry \u2013 nine M\u0101ori lost their lives in the first encounter with Cook and his men, and eventually the M\u0101ori people lost their sovereignty. Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand PM, said: \u201cThere are things that need to be talked about when we talk about the 250th anniversary. Never before has the story fully been told of the loss of life when Cook arrived. This is the chance to talk about the reality of New Zealand\u2019s history, to acknowledge it, to be open about it. That might attract some protests but that is all part of the conversation.\u201d\n\nWhat she\u2019s not having \u2013 \u201cI just wasn\u2019t going to get there and it was easier to end it that way.\u201d \u201cSometimes the guy seems so fragile, he\u2019s just asking how you\u2019re feeling constantly and you can tell he\u2019s not going to stop until you finish.\u201d The Guardian asked five women why they have faked orgasms, and whether it is a feminist issue.

But there are others whose often radical work is frequently forgotten. In an effort to honour at least some of them, we asked black historians and cultural figures to nominate their own heroes and watershed events.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Communist leader Claudia Jones, 1948; right, the inventor and scientist George Washington Carver, 1937.

Phil Neville has said he does not \u201cfeel vulnerable\u201d in his position as manager despite England\u2019s defeat to Brazil on Saturday meaning that his side have now gone five games without a win.\n\nManchester United\u2019s crisis is not of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s making and the problems at United run deeper than the dugout, writes Paul Wilson.

The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, is considering his position in the wake of Alberto Salazar\u2019s four-year ban for doping offences.\n\nBusiness\n\nAsian shares have inched up with Chinese stocks making modest gains after a week-long holiday. Investors remained cautious over US-China trade talks after Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely. On Wall Street the S&P 500 lost 0.45% on Monday, unable to sustain gains made after positive tweets and news headlines about the trade talks. The pound has been trading around $1.229 and \u20ac1.120 overnight while the FTSE should be ticking higher at the open.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe story of the wife of a US diplomat who \u201cfled\u201d the UK after a car crash that led to the death of Harry Dunn, a 19-year-old motorcyclist, leads on several front pages today.
