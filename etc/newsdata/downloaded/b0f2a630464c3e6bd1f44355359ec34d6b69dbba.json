I was five.\u2019\n\nThe 53-year-old said of Elton: \u2018Either he has got massive memory loss and he genuinely thinks his dad hasn\u2019t seen him in concert or maybe he wants to believe that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My dad was proud of him, you could see when Elton popped up on TV, his eyes lit up.\u2019\n\nGeoff insists their father was \u2018proud\u2019 of Elton (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nHowever, a rep for Elton, 72, doubled down on the singer\u2019s claims in his book and said: \u2018Elton stands by what he said in the book about his dad never seeing him perform.\u2019\n\nIn his memoir Me: Elton John, the iconic musician said of his relationship with his late father: \u2018I don\u2019t recall [my father] ever coming to see me play live, or talking about music with him. What I was doing clearly wasn\u2019t really his thing.\u2019\n\nElton\u2019s strained relationship with his father was also portrayed in the recent biopic Rocketman, which starred Taron Egerton, and showed how Dwight struggled to accept his son\u2019s music career.\n\nThe Your Song crooner makes some startling revelations in his new memoir, including recalling a suicide attempt, cocaine binges and wild tales of partying with the likes of Princess Diana, Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nHe also describes his mother Sheila as a \u2018sociopath\u2019.\n\nMe: Elton John is out on 15 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
