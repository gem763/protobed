They were poolside at a snazzy hotel in Rajasthan, yet Brown found himself irritated at having to change for lunch; why weren\u2019t there tailored swim shorts that could go from pool to restaurant? So he went home and spent two years refining the design, then gave each pair a five-year guarantee.\n\nThe rest is (lucrative) history.\n\nExcept it is what comes before this well-worn tale that is intriguing. Up to this point, Brown had exhibited precisely zero indication of an entrepreneurial sense of mission. A glance at his CV pre-OB shows such a muddle of endless study, friends feared he\u2019d be an eternal student. (Brown started several degree courses at various colleges, and was still doing that when he went back to college at the age of 32.)\n\nAdam Brown with his grandmother Penelope Beaumont in Cornwall, England in the early 1990s. Supplied\n\nWhen it came to working for a living, for a while he was a not especially driven real-estate agent. Then he became a fundraiser for London Lighthouse, a residential support centre for those living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201cI did that for eight years. I got down to the final two for a job as the head fundraiser for another organisation and I just thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m in the wrong career,\u2019\u201d Brown tells me as we sip our coffee and watch the morning sun illuminate the beach. In countless profiles, he has been described as a \u201cphotographer turned designer\u201d, and it\u2019s true he has a great eye and he did indeed work as a photographer for six years. \u201cBut one day, it dawned on me I wasn\u2019t meant to be a photographer either.\u201d\n\nAll the time I was thinking about how I just wanted to get on the phone and thank all the people who had made it happen. \u2014 Adam Brown, on selling to Chanel\n\nBy now, friends were urging him to get a grip. But Brown didn\u2019t panic. He was raised by his grandmother, an eccentric and adored lady named Penelope Beaumont who imbued him with resilience and self-belief. Brown\u2019s parents, British expats working in what was then known as \u201cthe Far East\u201d, divorced when he was tiny; his (late) father, to whom he says he \u201cremained close enough\u201d, stayed in Japan, while his mother found work in London and saw her two children only on weekends.\n\nAdam Brown founded Orlebar Brown in 2007 and sold to Chanel 11 years later. Gabby Laurent\n\nBrown and his younger sister found this perfectly normal, as they did being bundled into Granny\u2019s beat-up, sky-blue Volkswagen Beetle at the start of school holidays and arriving two days later in remote Cornwall, where Granny would knock on doors asking if anyone knew of a cottage to rent. \u201cHer attitude was, \u2018Aren\u2019t we lucky to be here, and while there\u2019s daylight, even if it\u2019s a howling gale, we\u2019re going to enjoy the beach.\u2019 So we did. And she gave me this great belief it would all turn out fine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYears later, on the day it looked clear that \u201cfine\u201d was going to be something of an understatement, Brown was at a weekend wedding in Corsica, \u201cwhich was surreal, because there were rumours in the [newspaper] business sections that we were being acquired by Chanel, but I couldn\u2019t jinx it by telling even my closest friends\u201d.\n\nBy the following Tuesday morning, he was at a day-long meeting in a City of London lawyers\u2019 office, \u201cwith more documents than I\u2019ve ever seen in my life laid out before me, neatly colour-coded with whose signature has to go where, and there were about 14 of us and this long ceremony of signing hundreds of times. I wish I\u2019d bought a special pen, but I didn\u2019t think of that, so it was just some old Bic.\u201d\n\nPieces from the Orlebar Brown James Bond collection. Supplied\n\nNeither did Brown pull on a suit. \u201cWhy would I? I just wore what I always wear [OB chinos though, not shorts] and anyway, I was going straight to the airport for the last flight to Naples because we were doing the OB campaign shoot the next morning. So I\u2019m there with my cheap pen, signing the most important documents of my life, yet keeping an eye on the clock so I don\u2019t miss my budget flight.\u201d\n\nWhen his plane landed in Italy, Brown received a text to say one of the documents hadn\u2019t been signed correctly. \u201cAnd everything at the airport was closed and I had an hour\u2019s taxi ride to the hotel and everyone in London was still waiting in the room. I got to the hotel \u2013 by now it\u2019s almost 2 o\u2019clock in the morning \u2013 and had to ask the night porter to witness my signature. And we were still at it at 3 in the morning and I had to be up at 6, and I still couldn\u2019t say anything. And all the time I was thinking about how I just wanted to get on the phone and thank all the people who had made it happen.\u201d\n\nOne of the first calls was to Julia Simpson-Orlebar, who was integral to the research and launch phase. She is no longer with the company, but her name, combined with Brown\u2019s, made a fashion fledgling appear as if it had been around for years. \u201cWe are great, great friends,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAnd she put a few thousand in at the beginning, so found herself with a very nice return on it.\u201d\n\nIn my naivety, I didn\u2019t know it was complicated, multiple pattern pieces, double stitching everywhere. But I never doubted it. \u2014 Adam Brown, founder\n\nIn response to the question, \u201cWhy has it all worked out so well?\u201d, Brown says: \u201cI think clarity of message has been fundamental to everything.\u201d While Orlebar Brown has offered T-shirts, sweaters and chinos as well as swim shorts since 2010, \u201cit comes down to one short, four lengths, good fit, regardless of your body shape\u201d.\n\nHe gets up and walks across the vast room under a soaring wood-panelled ceiling (all tastefully decorated by Jonathan Reed), returning with a sketchpad on which he draws four quadrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople had done great swim shorts as part of a collection, but nobody had made it the focus of their collections. So you\u2019ve always had sport [he writes Speedo in the first quadrant]; you\u2019ve always had the surf/board shorts [he writes Quiksilver in the second]; the Riviera boxer with the elasticated waistband [Vilebrequin in the third].\u201d\n\nThen his pen hovers over the empty square. \u201cTailored. Nobody was doing it. In my naivety, I didn\u2019t know it was complicated, multiple pattern pieces, double stitching everywhere, complexity that adds cost. But I never doubted it.\u201d\n\nFortunately, neither did Konig, even when it meant remortgaging their London flat. Brown remembers that as \u201cthe single most terrifying moment, especially when you\u2019re with somebody who\u2019s earning their salary and we were mortgaged up to the hilt already and you\u2019re putting both people at risk. But I did believe in the idea.\u201d\n\nThe metal side-fastening detail is OB's signature. Supplied\n\nSo, as it would turn out, did a multitude of men. Orlebar Brown launched as a transactional website and sent out an email to a target list of 600 names. Thanks to Konig\u2019s connections, it soon garnered mentions in magazine shopping pages, too.\n\nBrown worked mostly alone in a storage facility under a motorway, steaming the shorts, packing and dispatching orders, including to Australians who found the brand early, meaning he also had to master how to pay duty and be prepared to answer customer service emails in the middle of the night.\n\nIt helps, then, that Brown needs only four hours\u2019 sleep a night. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a long sleeper,\u201d he shrugs. In the first year, turnover exceeded \u00a350,000. Brown has since repaid Australian loyalty with OB stores in Bondi, Brisbane and Noosa, as well as seasonal pop-ups.\n\nYear two saw turnover triple. Year three brought the first wholesale accounts from the directional trio of Selfridges in London, Barneys New York and (the now shuttered) Colette, Paris. By year four, with business approaching the \u00a31 million mark, Brown sought angel investment.\n\nHere, past experience did prove helpful. \u201cMy golden rule as a charity fundraiser was not to rely on friends. Categorically, I would never recommend anyone raise money from their social circle. I was clear what I needed funding for: web development, digital, customer acquisition as well as financial management skills. I knew who I wanted that from: Mark Esiri [of Venrex Investment Management, a British-based investment firm that specialises in seed funding online businesses].\n\nThat selling to Chanel is glamorous is not lost on me. But it is about much more than that. \u2014 Adam Brown\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Again, I\u2019d learnt from my fundraising days that it\u2019s not about what you ask, it\u2019s about who does the asking; the key being to find the right person to introduce you.\u201d\n\nIt worked. The next round of funding, in 2013, would bring in \u00a38 million from London-based Piper Equity in exchange for a significant minority stake. By this point, Paul Donoghue, now chief executive, had joined the company as commercial director, \u201cand he\u2019s fundamental to all of it\u201d, Brown acknowledges.\n\nBetween these two funding rounds, a fit man pulled himself out of a swimming pool and sold about 6000 pairs of shorts in a week and then thousands more. When Daniel Craig as 007 wore Orlebar Brown in Skyfall (2012), it was not paid product placement but the result of a random phone call from the production company asking for something for James Bond to swim in.\n\nOB ranges extend to puffer jackets, but Brown has ruled out moving into women's wear. Supplied\n\nThis has since ignited a three-phase partnership: phase one, in 2018, using Bond movie artworks photo-printed onto shorts; the second, earlier this year, a 15-piece capsule collection based on classic Bond scenes, including the one where Sean Connery wore a towelling onesie in Goldfinger. And the third? Will it be about kitting out the next rumoured Bond, Richard Madden? \u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m not brought into any of those conversations. No, you will have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to the acquisition by Chanel, Brown was tasked with distilling what the brand stood for and mapping ambitions for its onward journey. The result is an internally published book titled OB to 20, 2007-2027, which serves as a mission statement of customer-facing strategy for the internal team as well as external partners, such as department stores, so they may understand what the brand is about (answer: sharing sun-lit holiday celebrations with loved ones) and what it isn\u2019t about (stag parties with champers in Ibiza).\n\nThis road map shows where the brand can expand: luggage, sun skincare, etc, but also closes off the roads down which Brown never wants to travel. \u201cWill we add city suiting? No. Will we launch women\u2019s swimwear? No. One of the things that most appealed to me about the agreement with Chanel was never having to have those sorts of conversations again.\u201d What Brown also relishes is a shared recognition of true luxury. \u201cI will never be asked if we can make a T-shirt for $8.\u201d About 95 per cent of Orlebar Brown production is in Portugal and the rest is in top factories in Asia.\n\nThe promise of Orlebar Brown to help you \u201cHoliday Better\u201d is woven though every aspect of both the online and in-store experience. This is not weather-washed Cape Cod clapboard; it\u2019s the hard lines of deco, lido and masculine glamour; it\u2019s the world of the photography of Slim Aarons, rarefied and elegant.\n\nShorts cost from $250 to about $600, the kind of price range that perpetual icons \u2013 think the various Bonds, Alain Delon in Saint-Tropez or Cary Grant on the Riviera \u2013 might find reasonable for quality and longevity.\n\nA design-your-own service allows favourite photographs to be turned into personalised swim shorts. Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shorts are vehicles for storytelling in evocative photo prints, whether chosen by the brand or by customers themselves. A design-your-own service called #SnapShorts allows for a favourite photograph to be turned into personalised swim shorts. Sunglasses have vibrant rubberised details; confident, not restrained.\n\nThe clothes aim for a tailored modernity. T-shirts have a deeper V-neck, and a rounded hem to avoid being boxy. Polo shirts are inspired not by sport but by leisure, with two-part collar details and cuffs as opposed to knit ribs. Fabrics are towelling, cotton pique, linen and silk-cotton mixes, while colours are vibrant, even when pastel pink or yellow. \u201cOB is very pedantic about the right shade of blue,\u201d says Brown.\n\nAnchoring everything is the metal side-fastening detail taken from men\u2019s trouser tailoring. It\u2019s on the shorts, it\u2019s on the chinos, it's the signature. It's the OB version of Chanel\u2019s crossed \"C\"s.\n\nChanel also owns the Paris-based swimwear brand Eres, which was founded in 1968. One can imagine the Eres girl going to the beach with the OB boy. Or the Eres store sitting next to the OB store. \u201cEres has done things that we've yet to do,\u201d Brown says. \"Eres is in parts of the world that we're not. In return, we bring deep digital expertise.\"\n\nChanel does not comment on its acquisitions, but the mutual ways two chic, small brands might help each other would have been part of the appeal of the purchase of Orlebar Brown. Another, one guesses, might be that, given Chanel is owned, helmed and run by wealthy men who spend leisure time around water, they may have discovered for themselves that Orlebar Brown\u2019s flattering tailored shapes help them holiday better.\n\nYet the attraction is also more profound. Chanel is never just about clothes \u2013 it\u2019s about brand DNA; it\u2019s about codes; the camellias, the tweed, the stark black and white and the crossed \u201cC\u201ds. Orlebar Brown has a clear iconography through every aspect of product and imagery, which imbues it with recognition far beyond its current size. In this consistency lies the promise of upswing. \u201cThat selling to Chanel is glamorous is, believe me, not lost on me,\u201d Brown adds. \"But it is about much more than that.\"\n\nBrown has a long history with Cornwall. Gabby Laurent\n\nThe biggest driver of sales remains customers themselves. About six years ago, after men started tagging Orlebar Brown in their Instagram holiday snaps, the company responded with a hashtag #OBsaroundtheworld and the promise of a slogan T-shirt, to be claimed in store, as an incentive to use it. Only a tiny percentage have ever claimed one. \u201cPeople feel a genuinely emotional connection that goes way beyond the transactional,\u201d Brown says. \"They like being part of it.\"\n\nWhich pretty much sums up how he feels about Cornwall. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve got now is what I started with,\u201d he says, gazing out that huge window. \u201cThat\u2019s the beach where I learnt to swim, where I learnt to surf, where I first got drunk, where I returned with friends from college. It\u2019s where, when friends have died, we\u2019ve sprinkled their ashes off the headland. The measure of success for me has always been the same: \u2018One day I\u2019m going to have my own house in Cornwall.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis actual house, as you will have gathered, is rather grander than the humble cottages Granny used to rent. Back then, Cornwall was sandcastles and home-made sandwiches and frozen fish fingers heated up for supper. Now, it\u2019s kite surfing and famous chefs fronting beachside restaurants with stars.\n\nA downside of this fanciness is that it is impossible to find a place to park. With that in mind, Brown and Konig make a point of leaving their front gates open. \u201cImagine if there is a boy now whose grandmother couldn\u2019t take him to the beach because there is nowhere to park her old banger,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAlthough people are a bit astonished when I offer, I say, \u2018It\u2019s fine, just park it in here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe September issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, August 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.
