Now movies are no longer limited to silver screens. One can access them on OTT platforms. Not just that, fresh content is just being churned out especially for international audience which are not censor board bound.\n\nDigital streaming is making lives of filmmakers way easier since it shows the content in its true and rich form. Indian filmmakers and actors too are gradually moving to OTT avenues to explore more opportunities and create a wider fan base.\n\nNetflix\n\nAfter Saif Ali Khan's historic debut with Sacred Games, Bollywood actor Priyanshu Painyuli had made a debut on Netflix with Upstarts. As the name suggests, the movie is about the start up culture in India and the nitty gritties that cone with it.\n\nPriyanshu was earlier seen in Bhavesh Joshi. Speaking about his transition from Bollywood to digital, the actor says, \"It's been wonderful. As an actor, you want to explore different mediums. It's basically different kinds of storytelling in all these mediums. Theatre was different. I did a musical also and lots of stage shows. Then cinema on the big screen was different but the process remains the same. As an actor, you just want to play human emotions on the screen. But with Netflix, it's reaching out to different audience. People can't make excuses that they missed watching the film since it will remain on Netflix and will feature in 190 countries.\n\nDon't Miss 207 SHARES 436 SHARES 435 SHARES 255 SHARES\n\nLooking back at his journey, Priyanshu says, 'People still remember from Bang Bajaa Baraat series which was also online, and then he had a short role in Rock On 2. People could identify me but Bhavesh Joshi just got me into the map because of the role and the film it was. It has been overwhelming post Bhavesh Joshi. Industry respects me for the choices I am making. And now there are a couple of movies back to back but Upstarts is where i am focusing all energies on.'\n\nThe movie is special to Priyanshu for 2 reasons. It takes him back to College life and Bangalore. Speaking about the same, the actor says, \"Energy as a college graduate is very different. I come from a Bangalore college. I could resonate with the movie because when start up was booming, everyone wanted to have a business. My character Kapil Mathur wants to try everything and at the same time add something to the society. The college energy is - lets come up with ideas and do something about it and the vibe of the movie is also the same.\n\nscreengrab\n\nTo take up acting professionally has changed my life. Earlier I explored myself on theatre but later, I thought this is what i want to do seriously as well. I love the different characters. Second best idea was to move to Mumbai in 2010. It was a great decision.\n\nSince Priyanshu has no filmy background, we asked him how difficult it is to make way into this glamour world and he says, \"Right now, avenues are more. More than a model, i was a theatre actor. Theatre is like sports, you keep working hard and keep at it. It's about a little patience. Infact the process in Bollywood has become better with casting directors. The audience wants to see new faces and unconventional stories. New actors, new writers, new directors and new content has to come in to impress people.\n\nAsking him about the constant comparison of Upstarts with TVF Pitchers and Priyanshu adds, \"No one has explored this world. We are giving a detailed drama beyond start ups. It is about how a CEO is formed, how investors fund the companies, what expectations are. Infact, I met a lot of CEOs during the research. The world of start ups look boring but it's actually interesting.\n\nBefore wrapping up, Priyanshu recalled he had his own startup too with 6 of his friends where he used to make corporate films so it was quite interesting but my focus was always acting. The wait is over, Netflix\u2019s new film Upstarts is on the service now and will definitely motivate the budding entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams. Apart from Priyanshu, the movie also stars Yash (Chandrachoor Rai) and Vinay (Shadab Kamal). Upstarts is directed by Udai Singh Pawar.", "description": "Before wrapping up, Priyanshu recalled he had his own startup too with 6 of his friends where he used to make corporate films so it was quite interesting but my focus was always acting.
