No matter how full you are, you\u2019ll still crave that sweetness.'\n\nThe nutritionist, who launches sugar detox programmes every couple of months, also reveals that the only way to break from the cycle is to cut it out completely - for 21 days. While she says your cravings will lessen, or completely vanish after a detox.\n\nHere she reveals to Femail how to recognise if you're a sugar addict, how you can break the cycle and the effects of sugar on our bodies.\n\nThe creator of a sugar detox programme called Make me Sugar Free, also reveals that the only way to break from the cycle is to cut it out completely for 21 days\n\nHow sugar effects us\n\nWhen we eat sugary foods they quickly convert to glucose and our blood sugar becomes spiked.\n\n'Insulin is produced to level out the blood sugar, but as it\u2019s playing catch up, it will end up removing too much blood sugar, leaving you in a low blood sugar \u2018slump\u2019,' reveals Leisa.\n\n'As soon as our brain detects low blood sugar, it quickly goes into \"panic\" mode and demands more glucose, resulting in a craving for something else that will quickly provide blood sugar, such as sweets, a chocolate bar or a muffin.\n\n'The cycle then repeats, with more junk food being eaten along with the resulting blood sugar spike\u2019.\n\nLeisa (pictured) a Nutrition and Health Coach, from Ireland, says that those with a sugar addiction are likely to have energy slumps throughout the day and eat when you aren't hungry - both of which are the result of the \u2018sugar addiction cycle\u2019\n\nThe tell tell signs of an addiction\n\nIf you are emotional or suffering from anxieties, Leisa says that it could be an indicator to whether we are addicted to sugar.\n\n\u2018As well as cravings and energy slumps, another sign of being addicted to sugar is your own personal emotional reaction to what you have just eaten.\n\n'A sugar binge can leave you feeling guilty and ashamed and self conscious about what we have eaten, regretting it soon after. This rollercoaster of sugar highs and lows, negatively impacts on our hormones too. For some this can feel like lethargy, for others it can induce feelings of anxiety.\n\n'To feel good or to boost our energy we reach for more sugary snacks, perpetuating the sugar craving addiction cycle\u2019.\n\n'Sleep will be all over the place too and you may also suffer from worse PMT if your addiction is really bad. When we pause and take a mindful approach to what we\u2019re eating and really look at how sugary foods make us feel it becomes clear if we are addicted or not.'\n\nRead the labels Most of us know that we'll find sugar in a chocolate bar or a doughnut but there's also lots of hidden sugars in all sort of foods, the nutritionist says. 'Unfortunately, as sugar is hidden in so many things today our taste buds have become used to sweet things and they are even hidden in things like tomato ketchup. \u2018Read the labels and find out where sugar hides. By learning to understand food labels and how to read them, you can easily find out how much sugar is in any food product. 'Under the 'Carbohydrate Of Which Sugars' look at the \u2018Per 100g\u2019 number, and that will tell you what percentage of that product is sugar. For example, a product with 25g per 100g means that it is 25% sugar. Another product with 36g per 100g is made up of 36% sugar. 'As a guide, a product with 5g per 100g of sugar is considered a low-sugar product\u2019 and is safe to put in your trolley. Also keep an eye out for sugar in the ingredients list - if it appears in the top three stick it back on the shelf.'\n\nHow to stop the sugar addiction cycle\n\nLeisa told Femail: \u2018The only real way to stop sugar cravings is to stop feeding them. Every time you get a craving and eat something sugary to satisfy it, it\u2019s a temporary fix.\n\n'The more you eat the more you\u2019ll crave. However, once you start actively dealing with sugar cravings by not feeding them, they will start to get weaker and weaker until they disappear altogether.\n\nWhen you stop eating sugar for a prolonged amount of time, your sense of taste intensifies. Sugar masks other flavours, so when you stop eating it, you begin to \u2018taste\u2019 again. You start to enjoy other foods. The more you experiment with other tastes, the more you\u2019ll enjoy and put distance between sweet cravings.\n\nTricking your cravings\n\nThe sugar expert goes on to say that by tricking your body into thinking you'll have sugar soon, or using other strong tastes to satisfy us will help with cravings.\n\n'Tell yourself you can have something sweet in ten minutes time, and then repeat this process until the craving fades.\n\n'It can be so easy to react to sugar cravings simply out of habit, such as eating biscuits with your tea or always having a mid morning or mid afternoon snack.\n\n'Be mindful about your eating habits and try to start recognising whether its because you are hungry or are craving sugar.\n\n'Being prepared for cravings can be the difference between success and failure when you are trying to cut sugar from your diet.'\n\nWhile another really tip is to drink herbal teas, such as liquorice based ones with strong flavours, to block the sweet cravings.\n\n'It\u2019s a really powerful taste - sugar can mask other tastes \u2013 at this stage when you are trying to give up sugar its about tricking yourself and reintroducing other powerful flavours like that - to disrupt that sugar taste.'\n\nBy eating plenty of nutritionally balanced, protein filled meals, you will be less likely to reach for junk food (stock photo)\n\nChanging your habits\n\nLeisa admits that giving up sugar will be hard at first but once you change a bad habit then you can start creating new ones.\n\n'It's all about disrupting your patterns, if you're used to having two sugars in your coffee cutting it down will be hard for the first few days but you'll barely notice it after a few days.\n\n'A lot of our cravings are to do with habits \u2013 so we need to start creating healthy habits. The more you cut down on sugar, the less likely you are to have sugar cravings. Also, the more sweet stuff you eat, the more likely you are to get them, Leisa reveals.\n\n'By removing excessive sugar from your diet, you will lessen the effects of the sugar addiction cycle, until it simply isn\u2019t a part of your metabolism.\n\n'For most people the cravings subside after a day or two and the great thing about a sugar detox is that once you actually break free from sugar addiction, you just don\u2019t get those urges anymore, allowing you to make sensible, healthy food choices that aren\u2019t based on irrational cravings.\n\nHowever, Leisa says that it doesn't mean you'll have to give up sugar forever: 'You won't crave it as much, but when you do fancy something sweet it will taste amazing. Even a piece of fruit will send a signal to the brain that it's being rewarded.\n\nPictured: A protein lunch of baked egg muffins and salad - a recipe on Make me Sugar Free website\n\nBe prepared for vulnerable times\n\nLeisa reveals that hunger is your enemy while trying to cut out sugar from your diet, and it and can be the number one reason you might fall off the wagon by reaching for a quick snack.\n\n'The same goes for other vulnerable times, if its your time of the month you're going to be lacking in certain minerals and will try and reach for anything closest to you.'\n\n'By eating plenty of nutritionally balanced, protein filled meals, you will be less likely to reach for junk food. If your diet consists of lot of processed food your cravings can be a result of your body lacking minerals and nutrients.\n\n'Its especially important during a sugar detox to bulk up on healthy foods. If you\u2019re eating a full spectrum of veggies and macros that pack in healthy fats, protein and vitamins, your body is less likely to crave unhealthy carby \u2018quick energy\u2019 releasing foods.'\n\nThe benefits are endless\n\nNot only will you be out of the sugar addiction cycle but you'll see lots of other health benefits too, the nutritionist says.\n\n'The best thing is the energy you feel when you come off it, its real energy too instead of the blasts off energy you get when you are eating sugar then the big slumps you get afterwards - you\u2019re not on a rollercoaster anymore.'\n\n'After a few days you'll be sleeping better and any mood swings will stop - as you're hormone will be on a platueu.\n\n'While anxiety levels will be down and you may even see that you skin brightens up. But best of all you'll feel in control of your body and more powerful because of it.'\n\nLeisa Cockayne, a nutrition and health coach, runs sugar detox programmes on her website makemesugarfree.com", "description": "Leisa Cockayne, a nutrition and health coach, from Ireland, says that you can recognise if you have a sugar addiction if you have big energy slumps throughout the day.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19544608-0-image-a-8_1570723764226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
