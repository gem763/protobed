After dropping to the lowest level in eight years, bidding wars are creeping back.\n\nIn September, 11% of offers written by Redfin, a national real estate brokerage, faced a bidding war. That is down dramatically from 41% a year ago, but up from the 10% reading in August.\n\nThat might not seem like a big deal, but in the past four years, the bidding war rate has dropped \u2014 not increased \u2014 from August to September.\n\nThe bidding war rate usually falls about 15 percentage points from the height of the housing season in March to the beginning of the slow season in September, at least according to seasonal patterns from 2013 to 2018.\n\nThat has not been the case this year. The rate fell just 4 percentage points during that same period. Part of the reason for that is that the spring season was unusually slow, so there was no great height from which to decline. High home prices, higher mortgage rates and low supply kept competition at bay, even though housing demand is still elevated.\n\n\"After the coolest spring home-selling season in at least eight years, homebuying competition didn't have far to fall, but low mortgage rates ultimately drove a modest uptick in bidding wars in late summer when they typically become less common,\" said Redfin's chief economist, Daryl Fairweather. \"With mortgage rates likely to remain near historic lows, I expect the bidding war rate to continue to level off\u2014rather than follow its typical end-of-year descent\u2014as 2019 comes to a close.\"", "description": "Cooler weather historically means a cooling off period in the housing market, but that is not the case this fall.
