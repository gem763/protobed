Each new update \u2013 be it by tweet, rumor or report \u2013 has sent markets reeling, as investors scrambled to recalibrate shifting odds of a near-term deal.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that sentiment will improve much if the talks break down in acrimonious recriminations,\u201d Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, wrote in an email Wednesday. \u201cA better earnings season and continued soft Fed policy would help to mollify markets, but it is a trade war resolution that they really crave.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, China was reportedly open to the notion of coming to a partial trade deal with the U.S., according to a report from Bloomberg citing an unnamed official. Such an agreement would be contingent on the U.S. rolling back any further tariffs, including two rounds set to take effect later this month and in mid-December, the report said. In exchange, China would reportedly pick up purchases of U.S. agricultural products, and potentially make some other minor concessions.\n\nIt is as yet unclear whether these gestures would be enough to satisfy President Donald Trump, who has previously said his \u201cinclination is to get a big deal\u201d rather than a partial agreement.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with China's President Xi Jinping before starting their bilateral meeting during the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019.

On Tuesday, the Trump administration then implemented travel bans on Chinese officials allegedly connected to these abuses.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. companies and organizations have come under fire in mainland China after showing signs of support for antigovernment protestors in Hong Kong. The National Basketball Association remains in hot water with Beijing after a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s now-deleted tweet last week backing Hong Kong demonstrators led to Chinese broadcasters and sponsors cutting some ties with the NBA. And Apple (AAPL) received a tongue-lashing in China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily news site on Wednesday after approving a map app allowing protestors to track police officers\u2019 locations.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade negotiations Thursday come less than a week before tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods are set to rise to a rate of 30% from 25% starting October 15. Further tariffs on an even broader swathe of goods are set to take effect on December 15.\n\nThursday\u2019s economic data, earnings\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its September consumer price index (CPI) Thursday morning, indicating the pace of consumer price increases \u2013 or decreases \u2013 during the month.\n\nConsensus economists expect that headline CPI rose 0.1% on a monthly basis in September, matching August\u2019s rate, according to Bloomberg-compiled consensus data. Over last year, CPI likely rose 1.8%, or just slightly faster than August\u2019s 1.7% pace of increase.", "description": "High-level trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators are slated to resume in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, providing an opportunity for both sides to make progress on a deal before the next tranche of tariffs on Chinese imports take effect.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V1VvMVnVdQ.RmOL7Om9X5Q--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/47407ce0-9c0c-11e9-bdff-a2d096f0f77e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
