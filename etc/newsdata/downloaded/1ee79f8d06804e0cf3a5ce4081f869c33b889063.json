Last year, their relationship deepened when a company he helped found retained Giuliani \u2014 associates of Parnas said he told them he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 for what Giuliani said Thursday was business and legal advice.\n\nEven as he worked with Parnas\u2019 company, Fraud Guarantee, Giuliani increasingly relied on Parnas to carry out Trump\u2019s quest for evidence in Ukraine that would undercut the legitimacy of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference on his behalf in the 2016 election and help him heading into his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nGiuliani dispatched Parnas and an associate, Igor Fruman, a Belarusian-American businessman, to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, where, despite fending off creditors at home, BuzzFeed reported, they ran up big charges at a strip club and the Hilton International hotel. Their mission was to find people and information that could be used to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation, and also to damage former Vice President Joe Biden, a prospective Democratic challenger to Trump.\n\nOver the past year, the two men connected Giuliani with Ukrainians who were willing to participate in efforts to push a largely unsubstantiated narrative about the Bidens. They played a key role in a campaign by pro-Trump forces to press for the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on the grounds that she had not shown sufficient loyalty to the president as he pursued his agenda there.\n\nThey met regularly with Giuliani, often at the Trump International hotel in Washington. And all the while, they were pursuing their own business schemes and, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday, illegally funneling campaign contributions in the United States in the service of both their political and business activities.\n\nThe indictment, along with interviews and other documents, show Parnas, Fruman and their associates as somewhat hapless operators, scrambling recklessly to use their new connections to the highest levels of American politics to seek financial gain while guiding Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, into a Ukrainian political culture rife with self-dealing and ever-shifting alliances.\n\nThe indictment provided new details about the dealings of Parnas and Fruman, as well as a pair of associates, including David Correia, who with Parnas helped found Fraud Guarantee, the fraud prevention and mitigation company that retained Giuliani. The four men were charged with campaign finance violations related to their efforts to enlist public officials in their moneymaking efforts and their political efforts in Ukraine.\n\nThe indictment does not name or identify Giuliani or Trump. But it helps show how Giuliani, who was retained by Trump as a personal lawyer to fend off one challenge to his presidency \u2014 the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller \u2014 helped steer his client into another: dealings with Ukraine that are now at the heart of the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.\n\nThe congressional committees overseeing the impeachment inquiry have subpoenaed Giuliani for records related to his efforts in Ukraine, including records related to Parnas, Fruman and Semyon Kislin, another Ukrainian-born businessman.\n\nParnas and Fruman had been asked to appear before House investigators this week, but declined. And Thursday, the congressional committees issued subpoenas demanding they produce documents by Wednesday, while signaling that the committees still expected the pair to testify to Congress.\n\nThe two men did get something useful for their Ukrainian efforts from Pete Sessions, then a Republican member of Congress from Texas, who is not identified in the indictment. It says that after making substantial campaign donations to him, Parnas asked Sessions for help last year in pressing the Trump administration to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Sessions subsequently wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticizing Yovanovitch and seeking to have her dismissed.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- When Rudy Giuliani set out to dredge up damaging information on President Donald Trump's rivals in Ukraine, he turned to a native of the former Soviet republic with whom he already had a lucrative business relationship.Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman with a trail of debts", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
