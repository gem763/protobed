On the other hand, moving rates for taxpayers earning under $2 million were \u201cnegligible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the effect increases with income is consistent with the established theory that average tax rates matter for extensive margin individual location decisions,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nProposition 30, approved by voters during a state-wide referendum in 2012, raised personal income taxes over the next seven years for California residents who were earning more than $250,000 each year. It pushed the top tax rate to 12.3 percent for filers earning $500,000 and above, or $1 million per couple. The measure also increased the sales tax in the state by 0.25 percent over four years.\n\nAs a result of the exodus, the study estimated the tax hike windfall that California priced in was eroded by about 45.2 percent. According to the California Budget Project, a research group that endorsed the proposition, the wealthiest 1 percent of Californians were expected to shoulder about 79 percent of the tax increase. The measure was expected to raise $8.5 billion in new revenue, according to the Department of Finance.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Proposition 30, approved by voters in 2012, raised personal income taxes over the next seven years for California residents with an annual income over $250,000.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/california-emissions-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
