The resolution was backed by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, several overseas pension funds and Australia's Vision Super.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir argument was that the Minerals Council has advocated for new coal-fired power stations and funded pro-coal advertising on Facebook and in The Australian newspaper, as well as sharing key staff with pro-coal lobby group Coal21.\n\nBHP in September recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution, but is reviewing its membership of all industry organisations. Mr MacKenzie told the AGM that BHP's similar reviews in the past had delivered tangible results.\n\nRio Tinto has previously threatened to quit the Minerals Council if it made statements contradicting the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Minerals Council last week responded to the campaign by promising to issue an action plan next year to help address human-induced climate change and limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n\nFormer Labor minister Chris Schacht took the floor at the London AGM to advocate against the ACCR's motion.\n\n\"[BHP] has an enormous influence if it stays in the industry association,\" he said. \"You can twist the arm [of other association members]. Every time that industry association says something against climate change, you should publicly disagree.\"\n\nBHP's British shareholders meanwhile voted in favour of the company's new remuneration scheme that aligns executive pay with performance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "description": "The London leg of the mining giant's AGM rejects a push to sever links with trade bodies seen as lagging on climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.454%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_275%2C$y_205/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f4440b72d88f7a6a118c623052efb6e4d120e6f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
