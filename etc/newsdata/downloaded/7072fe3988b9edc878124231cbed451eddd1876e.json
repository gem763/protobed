They conceded they cannot move forward,' Alex Spiro told DailyMail.com back in May after the tapes were tossed .\n\n'They have waived the white flag.'\n\nKraft had been celebrating his freedom all summer, where he has been seen at events like the 2019 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Awards in Boston, an awards ceremony in Israel and the French Open in Paris.\n\nAnd now, his Patriots have kicked off the season with a perfect 5 - 0 start.\n\nThe trial has proven to be disatrous for proesctuors, starting with the 10 individuals who appeared to be soliciting prostitution but were not charged when authorities determined the footage of the men was inconclusive.\n\nThen, there were reports that women had also been tped in the massage rooms.\n\nJudge Hanser, the Palm Beach County magistrate who is overseeing the Kraft case, first revealed that there were female clients caught on film just days before the proceedings came to a halt.\n\nIt did not stop there either according to Judge Hanser, who wrote that 'more than one woman had a significant portion of her spa time viewed... and the entirety of her spa time recorded and placed in Jupiter Police Department record.'\n\nThis was problematic for a number of reasons, he went on to state, with the most glaring being the fact that 'the search warrant did not allege that women were seeking illegal contact.'\n\nIn the order announcing that evidence obtained from hidden cameras and a traffic stop of Kraft would not be permissible at trial, Judge Hanser also detailed the flaws in the warrant obtained by the Jupiter Police Department to conduct their sting operation.\n\n'The fact that some totally innocent women and men had their entire lawful time spent in a massage room fully recorded and viewed intermittently by a detective-monitor is unacceptable and results from the lack of sufficient pre-monitoring written guidelines,' said Judge Hanser.\n\nThe number of women is not known at this time.\n\nA lawsuit was previously filed by a male client however who claimed he was at the spa while the sting was being conducted by Jupiter police.\n\nA complaint filed in federal court by attorneys Edward Mullins of Reed Smith and Joe Tacopania of The Law Offices of Tacopina & Seigel on behalf of a John Doe, accuses authorities of violating Doe's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, and constitutional right to privacy.\n\nDoe states that he was visiting the spa on January 19 for a massage that did not include any manual or oral sex act from a spa employee.\n\nThe filing, which was submitted in the United states District Court for the Southern District of Florida, goes on to state that Doe had a reasonable expectation of privacy as he undressed inside the spa and then received a massage while in the nude.\n\nHe is now seeking monetary, punitive and exemplary damages while demanding that no copy of any of the tapes showing men inside the spa be released to the press or public.\n\nDoe also wants those tapes, and any copies, destroyed for good.", "description": "The billionaire owner of the Patriots filed a complaint in Palm Beach County this week against States Attorney Dave Aronberg, just a few months after Aronberg's office was forced to delay his case.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19458336-0-image-a-12_1570563516600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
