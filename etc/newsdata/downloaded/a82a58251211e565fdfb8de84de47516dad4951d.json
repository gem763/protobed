REUTERS/David Gray\n\nHowever, an uptick in home prices in recent months, steady population growth and all-time low interest rates were expected to revive housing construction by 2021, Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said in a speech.\n\nHousing is a significant part of Australia\u2019s A$1.95 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy, with residential construction accounting for around 2% of total employment and 6% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\u201cMuch of the downturn in construction activity is still ahead,\u201d Debelle said in Sydney in a speech titled \u201cHousing and the Economy.\u201d\n\nHome prices and construction activity in Australia peaked nearly two years ago with approvals to build new homes around 40% lower than their late-2017 highs.\n\n\u201cWe are forecasting a further 7% decline in dwelling investment over the next year, and there is some risk the decline could be even larger,\u201d Debelle added.\n\n\u201cThis will directly subtract around 1 percentage point from GDP growth from peak to trough...\u201d\n\nHousing also impacts consumption. The RBA\u2019s standard estimate of the wealth effect is that a 10% fall in housing prices leads to a 1.5% fall in household consumption over time.\n\nDebelle also noted the recent downturn has had a \u201clarger-than-expected\u201d spillover effect on inflation as rents and new dwelling purchases together account for around one-sixth of the CPI basket.\n\nIn addition, a decline in housing turnover has weighed on \u201cownership transfer costs\u201d such as stamp duties and fees paid to real estate agents and lawyers. These costs are down more than 20% over the year to the March quarter, shaving around 0.5 percentage points of GDP.\n\n\u201cWe had not fully taken account of this in our forecasts of GDP and it is part of the explanation of why GDP growth has turned out to be slower than we had expected,\u201d Debelle said.", "description": "Australia's property downturn is hitting household consumption and is a big drag on economic growth and inflation that will likely last at least another year, despite three interest rate cuts, a senior central bank official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441647030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F20O", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
