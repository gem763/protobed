The Senate needs to speak up.\u201d\n\nThe resolution underscores the break between Trump and his GOP allies on Syria. The resolution warns against a \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d from Syria and urged Trump to certify that the \u201cconditions have been met for the enduring defeat\u201d of ISIS before a further withdrawal of troops.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull back U.S. troops from northern Syria, paving the way for the Turkish invasion, has sparked days-long fallout with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nRepublicans vented frustration about the strategy on Tuesday during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing that marked the first time administration officials have testified publicly about the decision.\n\nSen.

Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulRand Paul confronted over 'Republican bullshit' in restaurant This week: Tensions flare over Schiff, impeachment inquiry Turkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate MORE (Ky.), a libertarian-leaning GOP senator, who argued that Democrats were trying to avoid a larger war powers debate in Congress.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats are so hungry for war, let\u2019s have that debate,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell also panned the House measure, calling it \u201cbadly insufficient.\u201d He added that it was \u201csilent\u201d on the U.S. military presence in Syria and that \u201cperhaps the goal was to paper over disagreements within the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also hit the brakes on bipartisan calls for Congress to pass a tougher sanctions bill targeting Ankara over its military invasion.\n\n\u201cI am aware there is some appetite on both sides of the aisle to quickly reach for the toolbox of sanctions. ... But I caution us against developing a reflex to use sanctions as our tool of first, last and only resort in implementing our foreign policy,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nHe added that he is \u201copen to the Senate considering them. But we need to think extremely carefully before we employ the same tools against a democratic NATO ally that we would against the worst rogue states.\u201d\n\nIf the Senate is going to enact new sanctions, McConnell stressed that the Foreign Relations, Banking and Finance committees need to be involved.\n\nUnder an agreement announced by Vice President Pence last week, the administration said it would not apply further sanctions during a five-day cease-fire. After that time frame, which was crossed on Tuesday, the cease-fire would then become permanent and the Trump administration would lift sanctions announced earlier this month.\n\nGraham and Sen.

He\u2019s got his bill. ...
