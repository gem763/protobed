His family released a statement Thursday saying Money \u201cpassed away peacefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a unique texture to his voice. His songs had a bit of soul to them, and R&B that gave him a wide reach,\u201d Jim Farber, veteran New York City-based music critic, told FOX Business. \u201cThere was this kind of everyman quality to him.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn-born rock star, who grew up on Long Island, followed in his father\u2019s footsteps of becoming a New York City police officer, but moved to Berkeley, California two years later to pursue his dream of being a musician. He signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and emerged onto the music scene with his namesake debut album in 1977. Hits like \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise,\u201d and \u201cBaby Hold On\u201d went double-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nLike late musicians before him, critics say Money\u2019s legacy will live on -- whether it\u2019s through tribute concerts, a Broadway show, documentary or his reality show. And his catalog music sales will continue to spike.\n\n\u201cHe played to an audience around his age, 20 years younger and even a few years older. There\u2019s an audience that very much wants to hold onto its youth through the music; they\u2019re nostalgic for,\u201d Faber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEddie\u2019s Money-making hits\n\nMoney released his self-titled debut album in 1977 that spawned two top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 including the iconic \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise,\u201d and \u201cBaby Hold on.\u201d\n\nThe rockstar had 11 songs that reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 list between 1978 and 1992. Of those two made it to the Top 10 including, \u201cTake Me Home Tonight,\u201d the single that featured the iconic hook from The Ronettes, \u201cBe My Baby\u201d (No. 4, 1986) and \u201cWalk on Water\u201d (No. 9, 1988).\n\nEddie Money, portrait, circa 1975.

The rockstar toured, appearing on commercials on TV shows, like a 2002 episode of \u201cThe King of Queens,\u201d and a catchy 2012 commercial for GEICO insurance playing off the rocker's \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise.\" He even had a movie named after his song \u201cTake Me Home Tonight,\u201d in 2011. And in 2016, Money interviewed with Oprah for her special, \u201cOprah: Where Are They Now?\u201d\n\nImage 1 of 3 \u25bc Eddie Money performing in 1978.

The show followed his life at home and on the road with his wife, Laurie, and their five kids. Money, a longtime smoker, talked about his health issues on the show where he revealed his cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cHe was very much about being an everyday guy,\" Farber said. \"The idea that you would see him with his family doing everyday things really fits with his image.\n\nLast year February, Money created and starred in his first-ever musical, \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise: The Eddie Money Musical\u201d in Rochester. The show chronicled his life story from the late 1960s as he trained to be a New York City police officer and his journey to rock and roll stardom through the 1980s. The show sold out thousands of tickets priced up to $60 each.\n\n\"For me, the musical captures that most important time when you're starting out before you get jaded,\" Money said in a press release for the show last year.\n\nEric Vaughn Johnson, a theater director and producer who worked with Money on the show, says Money would improv his own jokes. Off stage, he said, the rockstar was a regular guy.\n\n\u201cWe got a cheeseburger at McDonalds on our way to the theater. He didn\u2019t need to go to the best restaurants \u2014 although he did. Those were not important things to him; his important thing was being himself.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Money dead at 70: How his musical legacy will continue to live on.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/eddie-money-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
