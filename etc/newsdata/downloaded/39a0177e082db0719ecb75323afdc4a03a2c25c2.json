It has won the war so it's unlikely to allow for outside powers and the UN to change the constitution very much,\" Landis said.\n\nAl Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said the UN was confident it can move ahead with the process after initially running into problems over the body's composition.\n\n\"They finalised the list of participants last week and it was agreed in a meeting in Turkey by the leaders of Turkey, Iran and Russia,\" Bays said.\n\n\"I spoke to the secretary-general shortly after that and he told me he thought the deal had been done. But to make sure that the Syrian government was on board, he sent his special envoy to Damascus.\"\n\nFinalising the deal\n\nEarlier on Monday, UN special envoy Geir Pederson met Syria's foreign minister to discuss all outstanding issues in the committee's formation.\n\nSyria's official SANA news agency reported that Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem's meeting with Pederson focused on the body's setup and guarantees that it will be free \"from any foreign intervention\".\n\nMoallem was quoted as saying that Damascus will have a right to continue fighting \"terrorism according\" to international law.\n\nSyria has been gripped by violence since 2011 when security forces cracked down on demonstrators seeking democratic reforms.\n\nA ceasefire went into effect at the end of August, halting a major government offensive on the northwestern province of Idlib which is mostly controlled by al-Qaeda-linked Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nPedersen added that he has also been in contact with Nasr al-Hariri, who heads the committee that represents the Syrian opposition.\n\nAt a Russian-hosted Syrian peace conference in January 2018, an agreement was reached to form a 150-member committee to draft a new constitution. This was a key step towards elections and a political settlement to the Syrian conflict, which has killed over 400,000 people.", "description": "Announcement comes a week after UN chief said an agreement was reached concerning 'composition of the committee'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/19/adbbc56f413f4697b13d371bafc3664d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
