His death \u2014 much like his life \u2014 has become part of folklore.\n\nIn Afghanistan today, where space for music and dance has shrunk under the shadow of war, music channels still play his songs daily and fans \u2014 even those born decades after his death \u2014 continue to snap up his albums and join Facebook groups created in his honour.\n\n\u201cHis songs will touch your heart no matter what mood you are in, happy or sad,\u201d says Hashmat, who goes by one name and is the manager of \u201cAhmad Zahir\u2019s Cottage\u201d, a colourful restaurant in downtown Kabul.\n\nThe 26-year-old welcomes his customers \u2014 mostly young couples \u2014 with tea, a hookah pipe and most importantly, their hero\u2019s songs.\n\nZahir \u2014 an ethnic Pashtun \u2014 played concerts in various locations across the country and had fans among all ethnic groups in Afghanistan, which is far more polarised now than at the height of his fame.\n\n\u201cToday we see ethnic rivalries have sadly increased but Ahmad Zahir\u2019s music is still connecting people,\u201d explains Basir Burhan, a 30-year-old amateur musician.\n\nWherever you go in Afghanistan, he said, \u201cif there is music, there\u2019ll definitely be one Ahmad Zahir song playing\u201d.\n\nFormer DJ Zubair Rezaee, 27, described Zahir as \u201cevergreen\u201d.\n\nHe endures because when \u201cyou listen to his songs \u2026 you think they are for you, at any time, at any place.\n\n\u201cThe wars, the changes in society and a different generation, nothing has affected the quality of his songs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Rumours and secrets \u2013\n\nThe 1960s and 70s are remembered as a golden age of music for Afghanistan, when young musicians were mostly influenced by Indian classics and would flock to \u201cRadio Kabul\u201d \u2014 the only radio broadcaster at the time \u2014 to record hits at their studio.\n\nZahir\u2019s best-known works were inspired by Persian poets like Rumi and Hafiz, and he sang mostly in Dari or Afghan Persian.\n\nBut he did not shy away from covering Western greats such as France\u2019s Enrico Macias and, of course, Elvis Presley.\n\n\u201cAt a time when singers shaking their bodies or dancing on stage was seen as awkward, he appeared on stage and screen doing exactly that,\u201d said Zahir\u2019s friend Sobat, who also runs \u201cAhmad Zahir\u2019s Art and Culture Centre\u201d in Kabul.\n\n\u201cHe was talking about Elvis a lot and when you look at his hairstyle, his clothes, the way he moved his body in concerts, you realise he was inspired by Elvis.\u201d\n\nOver the decades since his death, conflicting accounts have surfaced about whether Zahir \u2014 who recorded more than 20 albums in his short life \u2014 was killed or died in a car accident.\n\nThe official line was that he was killed in a crash near the Salang Pass, north of Kabul.\n\nBut many maintain the communist regime assassinated him after his songs became increasingly critical, or because of rumours he had a secret affair with the daughter of the then prime minister.\n\nSobat believes he was murdered.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw his body in the coffin, there was hole in his forehead with signs of burns. He was shot at close range,\u201d he said.\n\nYears of war have followed and under the Taliban, who banned music, his grave in Kabul was desecrated.\n\nBut it has been rebuilt and since then, every June 14, his birthday, pilgrims have flocked to Shohada-E-Salehin Cemetery on the southern edge of Kabul to lay flowers on his grave and play one of his last memorable songs.\n\n\u201cMy death shall arrive one day/ In a spring bright with waves of light/ Oh, perhaps my lovers at midnight /lay wreaths on my sorrow(ful) grave,\u201d the lyrics read.", "description": "Kabul (AFP) \u2013 Sporting a black quiff and sideburns, Ahmad Zahir sang of love and heartbreak in liberal 1970s Kabul \u2014 a city now plagued by war", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/a784f6_sporting-black-quiff-sideburns-ahmad-zahir-sang-love-heartbreak-in-liberal-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
