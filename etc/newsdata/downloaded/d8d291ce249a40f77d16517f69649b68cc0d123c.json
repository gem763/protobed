Kevin began the conversation with a dose of humility. \u201cIt seems like there was something in your message that I didn\u2019t expect to become a sort of a kitchen table issue for America.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the episode unfolded as a searching conversation about Yang\u2019s ideas, especially his plan to give every American $1,000 a month (a concept called universal basic income, or U.B.I.); the thinking that lay behind the idea; and why it has resonated with so many Democratic voters.\n\nThe episode ended where it began, with Kevin articulating what he failed to foresee in his article back in 2018, when he called Yang\u2019s platform a longshot.\n\n\u201cSince then, he\u2019s been able to turn it into a discussion about what it means to be a human \u2014 about what we would do if we weren\u2019t so worried about making ends meet,\u201d Kevin explained. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the part that I didn\u2019t see when I first met him was that this argument \u2014 this sort of wonky economics argument about automation and U.B.I. and G.D.P. and all these other three-letter acronyms \u2014 that he could make it appeal to people on an emotional level by saying this is not just about giving you free money. But instead, he\u2019s saying it\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about what the money can allow you to do. And that\u2019s the part that I think I missed.\u201d\n\nThroughout the coming months, we will keep finding new ways to introduce you to the 2020 presidential candidates. We welcome your feedback on the best ways to do that.", "description": "What a colleague says he missed the first time.", "authors": ["Michael Barbaro"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/us/14daily-newsletter/merlin_160697547_fc3c0138-ad88-484b-a53c-faeee990748b-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
