Such vigilante conduct cannot be condoned,\u201d said Justice Chua Lee Ming in his judgement on Friday (25 October).\n\nJustice Chua also rejected Wham\u2019s arguments that the provision under the Public Order Act (POA) that prohibited him from holding a public assembly without a permit contravened Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore. The latter protects the right of all Singapore citizens to \u201cassemble peaceably and without arms\u201d. He was unconvinced by the defence\u2019s assertion that the permit requirement contravenes Article 14 because there is no practical remedy if the Commissioner of Police acting in bad faith refuses to grant a permit.\n\n\u201cThe appellant\u2019s submission would lead to the absurd result that any law that requires a permit or licence to be obtained before an activity may be lawfully carried out, can be struck down simply by arguing that the power to grant the permit or licence may be exercised in bad faith,\u201d said Justice Chua.\n\nOn Wham\u2019s argument that he did not have a legal obligation to sign his statement, which he had confirmed to be true and correct, the judge said, \u201cThis does not make any sense.\u201d\n\nHe noted that requiring the police officer who recorded the statement to obtain the statement-giver\u2019s signature is \u201cmeaningless\u201d if the police officer does not have the concurrent power to require the statement-giver to sign his statement. \u201cBeing required to sign his statement does not mean that the statement-giver has to sign the statement where he disagrees with its contents. He can amend his statement before signing it,\u201d said Justice Chua.\n\nFacts of the case\n\nIn February, Wham was fined a total of $3,200 after being found guilty of the two offences.\n\nOn 26 November 2016, Wham organised an event titled \u201cCivil Disobedience and Social Movements\u201d to discuss issues relating to civil disobedience and democracy in social change. Wham had publicised the event held at The AGORA, Sin Min Lane, on Facebook and it was open to the public.\n\nAmong the speakers was prominent Hong Kong student activist Joshua Wong Chi-Fung, who addressed the audience through a live Skype call.\n\nBut the event required a police permit due to Wong\u2019s involvement as he was a foreigner. On 23 November 2016, a police officer advised Wham to apply for a permit under the Public Order Act. But he did not so so.\n\nOn 20 December 2016, a police investigator recorded a statement from Wham at the Police Cantonment Complex. After it was read back to him, Wham affirmed that the statement was true and correct, but he refused to sign the statement.\n\nDuring the trial, Wham testified that he had asked for a copy of the statement if he were to sign it but his request was rejected.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Wham told the court that he would serve the default jail term of 16 days instead of paying the fine.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday entitled \u201cToday\u2019s High Court judgement for Skyping a foreigner without a permit\u201d, Wham said that his lawyers would be filing an appeal against the judgement in a month\u2019s time.\n\nThe 39-year-old, an outspoken advocate for foreign worker rights, has had numerous brushes with the law due to his activism. In May, Lee Hsien Yang, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s estranged younger brother, paid a security deposit of $20,000 for Wham to appeal against a contempt of court conviction.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSingapore activist Jolovan Wham under investigation for protesting outside courts without a permit by holding up sign\n\nCivil activist Jolovan Wham and SDP vice-chairman John Tan each fined $5,000 for contempt of court", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 Social worker and activist Jolovan Wham\u2019s appeal against his conviction and sentence for organising a public assembly without a permit and refusing to sign a police statement, has been dismissed by the High Court.", "authors": ["Nicholas Yong", "Assistant News Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V0iQz0r98PEPO8HcA2U5Ig--~B/aD05MzU7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3e002010-f3d5-11e9-b3fb-91632c500646", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
