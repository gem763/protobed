Benyam Muluneh, a clinical pharmacist practitioner at the University of North Carolina\u2019s top-rated Eshelman School of Pharmacy, says this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a very tough decision for pharmacies to make, but it\u2019s [weighing] benefits versus risk,\u201d Muluneh tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cAnd given the fact that there are several other options for the management of heartburn, I think it makes sense ... the implications of [the FDA\u2019s report] still need to be further elucidated so that we know what\u2019s happening, but I think that the pharmacies definitely made the right decision in not making it available.\u201d\n\nNow that the medicine is off the shelves at major pharmacy chains nationwide, what should those suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease and other heartburn-related conditions be taking? Muluneh says the good news is that there are multiple alternatives \u2014 but says that the first step should be getting in touch with your healthcare provider to see what they recommend. If you can\u2019t get an appointment with your physician right away, he says you can always talk to your local pharmacist instead.\n\nOne option they may present is famotidine (sold under the brand name Pepcid), a drug that \u2014 like Zantac \u2014 works by blocking the histamine receptors in your stomach. But it\u2019s not necessarily safe for everyone. \u201cZantac has more data over longterm in pregnant women,\u201d Muluneh says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don't want to just say everyone should switch over without the knowledge of their healthcare provider. There may be some patient-specific reasons.\u201d\n\nIf Pepcid isn\u2019t a good option, Muluneh says healthcare providers may recommend short-acting medicines (such as Tums or Gaviscon) or \u2014 in more serious cases \u2014 something that treats heartburn and acid build-up over the long term, like Prilosec. Muluneh is quick to note that stopping the medicine without guidance is a bad idea. \u201cI think the worst step to take is to self-discontinue and turn to other unapproved herbal supplements that are completely unregulated by the FDA,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can not say what's in them. It's best to seek guidance from healthcare providers who know the data and can help make evidence-based recommendations.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Muluneh says that those who have been taking Zantac shouldn\u2019t panic. \u201cThis type of information is important, but I don\u2019t think the purpose is to raise fear in the public,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cKeep in mind that this is a substance that is actually found in some food that we consume ... so the risk is probably small.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Weeks after the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that the heartburn drug Zantac contains small amounts of a carcinogen, four stores have pulled it from their shelves.
