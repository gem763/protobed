The trick will be deciding which is which. It can reject the Brexit deal that British and EU negotiators are discussing in Brussels, on the assumption it proposes a border down the Irish Sea.\n\nRejection would rupture its relations with Boris Johnson and could sink the deal in the Commons, shunt the UK towards no deal, wreck Northern Ireland\u2019s economy and add support for a united Ireland.\n\nOr Arlene Foster and her 10 Westminster MPs could endorse the deal and smooth its passage through parliament, then face howls of betrayal from rival unionists who will try to engrave Brexit on the DUP\u2019s tombstone.\n\nFoster kept the party\u2019s options open in a holding statement last Friday, which reiterated opposition to a backstop or any measure that would \u201ctrap\u201d Northern Ireland in the EU. It also urged a \u201cbalanced and sensible\u201d deal in Northern Ireland\u2019s \u201clong-term\u201d economic and constitutional interests \u2013 ambiguous language that left wiggle room. \u201cWe will judge any outcome reached by the prime minister against the criteria above,\u201d it concluded.\n\nLess ambiguous language came on Saturday from the party\u2019s Nigel Dodds, who told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \u201cNo, it cannot work, because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s impossible choice revolves around Downing Street\u2019s suspected drift back to a Northern Ireland backstop, leaving the region in a customs partnership with the EU. This would be a potential economic boon for Northern Ireland, with trade flowing in every direction, yet politically toxic for the DUP because of its \u201cblood-red line\u201d of no border in the Irish Sea, deeming that a violation of Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK.\n\nThe party backed leave, neither expecting it to win nor anticipating the profound implications for Northern Ireland\n\nRival unionists are already crying foul. \u201cI fear that Northern Ireland is being offered up by Boris Johnson as the sacrificial lamb to save Brexit for the rest of the UK,\u201d said Jim Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist party. It would be a \u201cfundamental assault upon our position within the United Kingdom\u201d, thundered Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice.\n\nThe DUP has made big U-turns before, such as sharing power with Sinn F\u00e9in from 2007, and electorally thrived. Conceivably it could do so again. But its identity and success rest on branding other unionists as pusillanimous wimps who cannot be trusted with the union. To have that turned against them could be costly at the polls. The alternative is also grim: kick the PM where it hurts and risk holding the bag for a no-deal exit that alienates Northern Ireland\u2019s business sector and pushes centrist voters towards Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\nThe dilemma results from some grievous miscalculations. For Eurosceptic kudos, the party backed leave in the 2016 referendum, neither expecting the Leave campaign to win nor anticipating the profound implications for Northern Ireland.\n\nThey compounded the error by depicting checks in the Irish Sea as an existential threat, rather than a technical issue with manageable political ramifications. Wielding leverage over Theresa May\u2019s government blinded the DUP to danger and engendered a giddy sense of unprecedented power. \u201cUnionism has never had so much influence in parliament,\u201d Foster boasted in 2017.\n\nThat seems a long time ago.", "description": "Reject the prime minister\u2019s deal and usher in an economy-wrecking no deal, or endorse it and risk unionist wrath at home?", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/910a7281531a64f51cffbe16e660410bf62af0ce/1195_778_4009_2405/master/4009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9f8be3acb5f70e2da0b6117bcb7a174", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
