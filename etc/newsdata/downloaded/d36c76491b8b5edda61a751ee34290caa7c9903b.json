That foothold grew exponentially stronger with Donald Trump beating a speedy retreat out of Syria and doing absolutely nothing to check Russia\u2019s power there. Who benefits? Assad, who Vladimir Putin has been propping up for years now, even though he killed 500,000 people.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe Russians actually bombed four hospitals within a 24-hour time period. Hospitals with patients in them, reported The New York Times. Who benefits? Putin. Because Assad now is, Ed Luce points out, cements power in Syria. Who benefits? Putin. Because Turkey, whose leader Erdogan is going to Russia, Turkey now builds a closer relationship to Russia. And as Ed points out \u2026 it just may be that Turkey will decide to leave NATO \u2014 they\u2019re a member in name only anyway \u2014 and actually create a strategic partnership with whom? France? No. Germany? No. With Vladimir Putin. Who benefits from all of this? Vladimir Putin and Russia. Nancy Pelosi was right, all roads lead back to Putin.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During Tuesday's \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC, host Joe Scarborough lashed out at President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Northern Syria. | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/scarborough-7-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
