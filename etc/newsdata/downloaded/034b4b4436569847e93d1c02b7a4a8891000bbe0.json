The Student government argued that the group would cause \u201cemotional harm\u201d to students.\n\nAccording to a report by Campus Reform, students looking to start a chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom faced repeated barriers constructed by their peers in student government.\n\nStudent government leaders rejected the group\u2019s request for official university recognition, which grants them access to university funds and privileges, such as the ability to recruit students during on-campus events.\n\nStudent government leaders argued that the conservative student group would cause \u201cemotional harm\u201d to students on campus, adding that the group\u2019s programming could make \u201cminority students feel more unsafe.\u201d\n\nEventually, Jeanne Rosenberger, the vice provost for student life at Santa Clara, stepped in and personally reviewed the student group\u2019s application for recognition. In a letter, Rosenberger announced that the student government had made the wrong decision by refusing to recognize the Young Americans for Freedom group. Rosenberger reversed the decision of the student government and granted the group official university recognition.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the summer, I reviewed all of the materials again, as well as my notes from meetings with student leaders at the end of the term,\u201d Rosenberger said. \u201cAlthough there were several reasons given for why some ASG senators voted against recognizing YAF, my further review led me to a different conclusion than was communicated in June.\u201d\n\nQuinn Eibert, the chairman of Santa Clara University\u2019s new Young Americans for Freedom chapter, argues that the student government\u2019s refusals to recognize the club are a symptom of a larger strain of political intolerance and anti-Semitism at the university.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark stand against the Student Senate\u2019s intolerance, dishonesty and anti-Semitism,\u201d said SCU YAF Chairman Quinn Eibert. \u201cSanta Clara is once again the bastion for free speech that we all know it to be. I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019re allowed to have a place on this campus. I\u2019m excited for students to learn what YAF is really all about.\u201d", "description": "Administrators at Santa Clara University were forced to step in after student government leaders refused to grant official recognition to a conservative student organization.
