And you are so grateful that you gibber but you know it is the compressor, it is always the compressor, never a tiny glitch and they know that you know but this charade has to be run through and we all pretend that good news will follow except that after they have smeared the wall and splashed dirty water carting off the machine they will call you in an hour to tell you the compressor (no cigars for guessing) has burnt out and the cost is now escalating exponentially.\n\nThe same sort of mean-spirited conspiracy occurs when your car does the dirty and begins to make those heart-sinking rattles and squeaks and you drive it to the mechanic with deep and abiding trepidation and you really think that it is going to be a minor infringement in the techworks like a fan belt needing replacement or some extra coolant and a three digit bill. Ha, where do you live? The senior mechanic will sigh and curl his lip like a doctor giving up on a terminal patient and say the twiddlebutt in your thingummy has cracked and I suspect the diddwat is worn out.\n\nYou are now again a victim of the most devious plot on earth in which worst case scenarios are inevitable and you have no clue what he is talking about except that the high four digits on the bill are now a certainty.\n\nAnd we have the temerity to call these inanimate objects which they most decidedly are not. I am a firm believer that everything in the house has a mind of its own. That is why keys walk away from you when you are in a hurry. The plumbing rumbles and starts to leak not by chance but only after the other appliances have got together and worked out the exact moment they can deliver maximum aggravation.\n\nThe gas runs out as guests arrive. The TV goes on the blink when Kohli is on 99. The mobile phone decides to become a slippery eel and falls out of your hands and the screen cracks cheerfully without any involvement from you. The Wi-Fi goes intermittent just as you have to send a vital email and there is now no Net and you are marooned. The washing machine makes a gurgling sound and dies on you with a full load locked within. And you really believe all this is random.", "description": "So your\u00a0AC has stopped functioning and the repair people have fetched up and now they shovel heaps of hope onto you that they will take it away and they will check it out and it...", "authors": ["Bikram Vohra"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bikram.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
