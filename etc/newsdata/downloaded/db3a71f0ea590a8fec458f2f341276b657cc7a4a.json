(Jay Laprete/AP)\n\nThe first time the artist Maria Farmer says she heard the name of fashion billionaire Leslie Wexner, she recalled, was when her employer, financier Jeffrey Epstein, told her, \u201cLes loves me. He\u2019ll let me do anything.\u201d\n\nFarmer, then 26, had just been invited to create two large-scale paintings for the upcoming film \u201cAs Good As It Gets,\u201d starring Jack Nicholson. Epstein offered Farmer an unexpected location to do the work in the summer of 1996: an expansive country home in New Albany, Ohio, located amid 336 acres of land owned by Wexner and guarded in part by sheriff\u2019s deputies employed by the longtime chief executive of Victoria\u2019s Secret and The Limited.\n\nIt was there, Farmer said in an affidavit she submitted as part of an Epstein-related lawsuit, that she was molested by Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn a series of interviews with The Washington Post, Farmer, 50, spoke publicly for the first time about Wexner and his wife, Abigail. She never met Leslie and says she spoke to Abigail only by phone while at the New Albany home. But she says she holds him \u201cresponsible for what happened to me\u201d because the alleged assault happened at the hands of one of his closest advisers on property Farmer says was monitored by Abigail and the Wexner security team. She says that she was held against her will at the property by Wexner\u2019s security staff after her alleged assault, until her father came to pick her up.\n\n[The layers of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s connections]\n\nFarmer\u2019s mother, father, sister and a friend all said in separate interviews that they heard similar accounts in 1996 from her.\n\nWhile Farmer\u2019s allegations against Epstein have been widely documented, her experience in New Albany and the questions it raises about the Wexner family\u2019s relationship with Epstein have been little explored. Wexner was the only known clients of Epstein, who, authorities said, killed himself in a New York City jail this summer. The allegations have roiled Wexner\u2019s image and business, and the board of his company, L Brands, has hired an outside law firm to conduct a review of the relationship.\n\nWexner has said he was unaware of Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes and cut ties with him as soon as he found out about them. A Wexner family statement said neither the 82-year-old Leslie nor Abigail knew who Farmer was before she made her allegations. The Wexners declined to be interviewed.\n\n\u201cMr. and Mrs. Wexner have condemned Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s abhorrent behavior in the strongest possible terms and severed all ties with him in 2007,\u201d Thomas Davies, a spokesman for the Wexners, wrote in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Epstein told Ms. Farmer about the Wexners. And while we don\u2019t know with whom Ms. Farmer may have spoken, who may have claimed to be Mrs. Wexner, it was not Mrs. Wexner. Before the recent news coverage of Ms. Farmer, Mr. and Mrs. Wexner had no knowledge of her, never met her, never spoke with her, and never spoke with Mr. Epstein or anyone else about her.\u201d\n\nMaxwell could not be located for comment. Her lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFarmer\u2019s interaction with Epstein dates back to the mid-1990s, when Epstein was active in the New York art scene and employed Farmer to answer the door at his Upper East Side townhouse. He presented the New Albany home as an alternative to her small walk-up apartment in Greenwich Village.\n\nFor two months in the summer of 1996, Farmer stayed in a country house that Wexner had deeded to Epstein four years earlier, according to property records. She had an Ohio driver\u2019s license, reviewed by the Washington Post, listing the address of the nearby Wexner mansion. Farmer says that she doesn\u2019t recall who drove her to get the license, but that she obtained a license to pick up Epstein and Maxwell from the airport the several times they visited that summer. The two homes sit in a town that Wexner had essentially built himself.\n\nShe says she was discouraged by Wexner\u2019s security staff from going outside without getting permission from Abigail Wexner, whom she says she spoke to by phone multiple times that summer. (She says she never met Abigail Wexner in person.) Farmer was a runner, but had to jog inside Epstein\u2019s 10,600 square-foot house.\n\n\u201cWhere I stayed that summer, in that house and working in that garage, all of it was within view of the Wexner house,\u201d Farmer said in the interview.\n\n\n\nAnnie Farmer, left, and Maria Farmer in the summer of 1996. (Maria Farmer)\n\nThe house, although owned by Epstein at the time, was \u201ceffectively the guesthouse\u201d for the main Wexner estate, and it was guarded only by Wexner personnel, according to a security officer involved with Wexner family security at the time, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to discuss clients publicly. The two homes are a half-mile apart. The grounds were monitored closely by guard dogs and their armed minders, this officer said. It was surrounded by Wexner\u2019s land, according to property records.\n\n\u201cAnybody that was going to be coming on property had to be announced and allowed in by the Wexners,\u201d added the officer. \u201cNobody had carte blanche to go in and off the property.\u201d\n\nDavies, the Wexners\u2019 spokesman, argued that the Epstein residence was just one of hundreds of homes within a community developed by Wexner.\n\n\u201cThe Epstein house was not on land owned by the Wexners, and was nearly one half mile away from the Wexner home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entrance to the Epstein residence was not through the Wexner gate.\u201d\n\nFarmer says that the other entrance to the Epstein house, down a long driveway, was locked and gated and she was not able to use it during her time there.\n\nEpstein has been accused by dozens of women of sexual predation in his other residences in Manhattan, the Virgin Islands and Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n[Autopsy finds broken bones in Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s neck, deepening questions around his death ]\n\n\n\nAn arrest photo of Jeffrey Epstein from 2006. (Palm Beach Sheriff's Office/AP)\n\nEarlier this year, when evidence emerged of Epstein\u2019s alleged misconduct, Wexner issued a statement accusing Epstein of having \u201cmisappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family.\u201d It was the first time he had made such accusations public. Epstein was never charged with any crime related to the alleged theft.\n\nEpstein had enjoyed extraordinary access to Wexner, then well on his way to becoming the wealthiest man in Ohio, atop an empire that included The Limited, Victoria\u2019s Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Wexner so trusted Epstein that he arranged for homes for him in Ohio and New York, according to public records. He granted Epstein power of attorney, enabling him to sign checks, hire people and buy real estate on his behalf, court records show. He hired Epstein as president of his real estate development company and named him a trustee of his charitable foundation.\n\nWexner remains atop his $5 billion company, an employer of about 88,000 people worldwide and a man in high esteem as a prominent philanthropist and business leader in Ohio.\n\nThe family name is near-ubiquitous in the Columbus, Ohio, environs, displayed on Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, the Wexner Center for the Arts and the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, thanks to hundreds of millions of dollars the couple have donated. Abigail Wexner additionally founded an anti-domestic-violence organization, the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence.\n\nWexner briefly addressed his relationship with Epstein \u2014 though not by name \u2014 when speaking with investors recently. Wexner, who has said he cut ties with Epstein more than a decade ago, said that \u201ceveryone has to feel enormous regret for the advantage that was taken of so many young women\u201d and cast his break with Epstein in universal terms.\n\n\u201cAt some point in your life we are all betrayed by friends. If we haven\u2019t, we are really fortunate to have led a perfectly sheltered life,\u201d Wexner said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, people that have secret lives, have secret lives. And they\u2019re secret because they\u2019re so good at hiding those secrets.\u201d\n\nDesigning a dream town\n\nIn the late 1980s, a series of anonymous companies began acquiring large plots of farmland 20 miles northeast of Columbus. One by one the large plots were enclosed by miles of white post-and-beam fences, all of it surrounding the tiny village of New Albany, population 400.\n\nWhen one of Les Wexner\u2019s partners disclosed that Wexner was behind the purchases, Columbus residents nicknamed the area Wexley. Wexner explained on the website for the New Albany Corp., the company he created to develop the property, that it had \u201cstarted with a simple idea \u2014 I wanted to build a house in the country.\u201d\n\nWexner enlisted top development professionals in the planning and flew them to Brittany in France, the Cotswolds in England and the James River plantations to design his dream town.\n\n\n\nThe New Albany Country Club in New Albany, Ohio. (Maddie McGarvey/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this boyish energy and excitement for things and at the same time he\u2019s got this world-class mind,\u201d said landscape architect John Kirk, one of the project\u2019s designers.\n\nWexner announced plans for thousands of Georgian-style homes, pressing local officials for the needed approvals. Nearly all the buildings on the land Wexner plotted \u2014 starting with the country club designed in the manner of an 18th-century Virginia plantation \u2014 have been built according to the original vision.\n\nDuring the same time period, Wexner developed a relationship with Epstein. \u201cI first met Mr. Epstein in the mid-1980s, through friends who vouched for and recommended him as a knowledgeable financial professional,\u201d Wexner wrote in a letter in August to his family foundation.\n\n[Billionaire alleges that Epstein misappropriated \u2018vast sums ... from me and my family\u2019 ]\n\n\u201cMr. Epstein represented that he had various well-known and respected individuals both as his financial clients and in his inner circle,\u201d Wexner wrote. \u201cBased on positive reports from several friends, and on my initial dealings with him, I believed I could trust him.\u201d\n\nUnder watch of armed guards\n\nIn May 1996, Farmer and a friend set out for New Albany in a Penske truck full of her art supplies.\n\nWhen she arrived at Wexner\u2019s white-painted gatehouse, she says she was greeted by a man who identified himself as a former Special Forces officer and Wexner\u2019s \u201cright-hand man.\u201d\n\nShe says she still remembers the path to the guesthouse: through the gatehouse, to the right and past the stables where Abigail Wexner, a lawyer Wexner had married three years earlier, now kept her horses.\n\n\u201c[Abigail] called me when I first got there. She wanted to welcome me,\u201d Farmer recalled.\n\nOver the course of the next two months, Farmer painted in the garage of the home, and said she was discouraged by Wexner\u2019s security staff from going outside without getting permission from Abigail Wexner. Owing to the size of the estate, and the limitations on her movements, Farmer says she never met Abigail Wexner in person.\n\nFarmer said she was told by security staff there were armed guards watching the house.\n\n\u201cWhenever I wanted to exit the guesthouse, I\u2019d have to call the main house and get Abigail on the phone to ask her permission to go outside,\u201d Farmer recalled.\n\nThe security officer said he remembered meeting Farmer but said he did not recall any incidents involving her that summer. The Wexner property was patrolled by dogs and armed security, he confirmed, adding that it is \u201cvery feasible\u201d that someone like Farmer would have been told to get permission before going outside, \u201cfor her protection, absolutely.\u201d\n\nMembers of Farmer\u2019s family recall her recounting the close watch she was under. One day Farmer says she went outside to sun herself in the backyard and the Wexners\u2019 security guards came over to ask her to go back in the house. Farmer\u2019s mother, Janice Farmer, said in an interview that she spoke to her daughter during that summer and at the time found it \u201cvery odd\u201d when Maria told her she had to get Abigail Wexner\u2019s permission to leave the house. Annie Farmer, Maria\u2019s sister, confirmed in an interview that Maria told her that she had needed Abigail Wexner\u2019s permission to leave the house.\n\nAbout a month into her stay, Farmer says, she obtained an Ohio driver\u2019s license, registered to Wexner\u2019s address, so that she could pick up Epstein and Maxwell at the airport, not far from New Albany.\n\n\n\nMaria Farmer\u2019s driver\u2019s license. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nDavies, the Wexner spokesman, declined to comment on how Farmer may have obtained a driver\u2019s license with the Wexners\u2019 address without the couple knowing.\n\n'You're not going anywhere'\n\nFarmer said she had a friendly dynamic with Epstein and Maxwell that summer. Epstein had arranged for a trip for then-16-year-old Annie Farmer to Asia and was promising her help with college admissions.\n\nIn her affidavit, Maria Farmer described what she says happened to her during the last of several visits that Epstein and Maxwell made to see her that summer: \u201cThey asked me to come into a bedroom with them and then proceeded to sexually assault me against my will.\u201d\n\nAfter the alleged assault, Farmer said she immediately locked herself in her room and called several people in New York, looking for assistance.\n\nShe eventually called her father, who agreed to come to Ohio. Frank Farmer confirmed to The Washington Post that he received a distressed call from his daughter and drove to pick her up.\n\nMaria Farmer remembered calling 911, being put on hold, and then being hung up on. She also called the Franklin County sheriff\u2019s office, she said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know Wexner had contracted with the sheriff\u2019s office to help protect his property. She recalled the person on the other end of the phone telling her, \u201cWe work for Wexner,\u201d and that an officer was at the gate.\n\nIn the affidavit, she says she \u201cpleaded with\u201d the security staff but was held against her wishes for 12 hours while waiting for her father to arrive. In the interview, she elaborated.\n\nThe morning of the day after the alleged assault, she said, Farmer spoke with Maxwell and Epstein. She told them she wanted to leave and hung up. Soon after, a Wexner security guard appeared at the house. \u201cHe said, \u2018You aren\u2019t leaving,\u2019 \u201d Farmer recalled, \u201c \u2018You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLater that morning, the security guard came over again, rang the doorbell, and asked her to go outside, she recalled. He took her by the arm and said she should come with him.\n\n\u201cI fought him,\u201d Farmer said, so much so that she had a bruise on her arm from the incident. Eventually, the altercation ended and Farmer says she walked to the security gate, where her father was waiting.\n\nThe security officer who declined to be named but was familiar with the guards at the property said he didn\u2019t believe something like this could have happened. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what happened, and I can tell you, if that had happened, I would have remembered it,\u201d he said.\n\nHer father told The Post that after he arrived at the estate, there was an issue at the security gate. He did not recall other details, but he remembered that he was able to eventually retrieve her and take her to his home in Kentucky.\n\nA spokesman for the Franklin County sheriff\u2019s office said that its officers were contracted to work as part of Wexner\u2019s 24-hour security detail at that time, but say they have no record of Farmer\u2019s 1996 call.\n\n\u201cThe person who made that affidavit never contacted us,\u201d said Marc Gofstein, the public information officer at the Franklin County sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cIf we had a record and she contacted us then we\u2019d go right into it looking at it. Doesn\u2019t matter who it is or who they are filing a complaint against, we open it up.\u201d\n\nAccording to the records retention policy of the Franklin County sheriff\u2019s office, the department does not retain records of the type of call Farmer says she made for more than two years.\n\nFarmer\u2019s mother and sister confirmed to The Post that Maria Farmer shared details of her experience with them not long after she left New Albany. She ran into a friend, artist Stuart Pivar, soon after her return to New York and told him that Epstein had done \u201cawful things\u201d to her that were \u201ctoo terrible to repeat,\u201d Pivar said in an interview with The Post.\n\n'Nobody listened' to reports\n\nShortly after she left the New Albany property, Farmer learned from her younger sister that she also had been touched inappropriately by Epstein and Maxwell earlier that year, according to her affidavit. Annie Farmer had visited Epstein\u2019s New Mexico property in April 1996.\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Annie described having to give Epstein a foot massage at Maxwell\u2019s direction and also receiving, while topless, a massage from Maxwell, with the sense that Epstein may have been watching.\n\nAnnie said she didn\u2019t tell anyone about it at the time because she thought of Epstein as Maria\u2019s boss and didn\u2019t want to disrupt her employment.\n\nWhen she returned to New York from Ohio, Maria Farmer says she filed a police report about her alleged assault, the contents of which were reviewed and later reported on by the New York Times. She said officers at that precinct encouraged her to speak to the FBI, which she says she did. No one appeared to act on her reports, she says, until the FBI knocked on her door in 2006 to interview her about Epstein. The FBI declined to comment.\n\nShe alleged in her affidavit and to The Post that Maxwell and Epstein warned her after she returned to New York to keep quiet about the incident, and that those threats were key to her eventual departure from the city. She says she has no plans to sue Wexner.\n\nFarmer\u2019s allegations were publicly revealed as part of a lawsuit filed by another alleged Epstein victim. Farmer submitted her affidavit in April in support of a defamation suit by Virginia Giuffre against Harvard University professor Alan Dershowitz, who has served as Epstein\u2019s lawyer. Giuffre filed an initial suit in 2015 implicating Dershowitz in a sex ring operated by Epstein.\n\nDershowitz has denied the allegations and accused Giuffre of perjury. Dershowitz alleged that Giuffre\u2019s allegations against him were made as part of an effort by Guiffre to secure a payment or settlement from Wexner.\n\nDavid Boies, Giuffre\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview that no one involved in the Giuffre case ever attempted to extort money from Wexner, nor was any payment ever made. Both Giuffre and Farmer are represented by Boies.\n\nBill George, the former chief executive of Medtronic who says he is a friend of Wexner\u2019s, said he believes Wexner was hoodwinked by Epstein and that he\u2019s done nothing wrong.\n\nHe called Wexner an \u201cextremely ethical person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel very confident that Les had no idea what this guy was doing in regard to young women,\u201d George said.\n\n[Victoria\u2019s Secret owner retains law firm to review company\u2019s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein ]\n\nYet analysts have begun questioning whether Wexner can survive at the helm of the company he created. Wexner\u2019s retail empire has fallen on hard times recently, with its stock losing more than 80 percent of its value in the past four years, dropping from nearly $100 a share to under $19.\n\n\u201cThe Jeffrey Epstein thing should be a huge red flag,\u201d said Sucharita Kodali, a senior analyst at Forrester. \u201cIt is an extremely disturbing situation that should raise the question of a CEO\u2019s judgment.\u201d\n\nTammy Roberts, an L Brands spokeswoman, declined to comment, beyond a July statement that said: \u201cWhile Mr. Epstein served as Mr. Wexner\u2019s personal money manager for a period that ended nearly 12 years ago, we do not believe he was ever employed by nor served as an authorized representative of the company.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites and Kathy Lynn Gray contributed to this report.", "description": "Artist Maria Farmer says the Ohio property on which she stayed during the summer of her alleged assault was guarded by Leslie Wexner\u2019s security.
