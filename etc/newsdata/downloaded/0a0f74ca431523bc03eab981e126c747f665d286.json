It said it is suspending all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the United States.\n\nKevin Burns, Juul\u2019s chief executive officer, is being succeeded by K.C. Crosthwaite, Altria\u2019s senior vice president for chief strategy and growth. Crosthwaite oversaw \u201ccommercial and regulatory efforts\u201d related to the launch in the United States of IQOS, a \u201cheat-not-burn\u201d alternative to cigarettes, Juul said in a news release. IQOS is made by Philip Morris International and marketed in the United States by Altria.\n\nAltria owns a 35 percent stake in Juul.\n\n[FDA blasts Juul for illegally marketing e-cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes]\n\nJuul also said it will end its \u201cMake the Switch\u201d campaign that FDA officials had criticized for implying that its e-cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes. The agency has to give companies specific authorization to make such a claim.\n\nThe staff shake-up was announced by Burns and Juul co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen.\n\nIn a separate announcement Wednesday, Philip Morris said merger talks with Altria \u201chave ended\u201d and that the companies have \u201cagreed to focus on launching IQOS in the U.S. as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke-free future.\u201d Noting that \u201cIQOS is not an e-vapor product,\u201d the statement said the cigarette alternative \u201cis the only heated tobacco product with premarket authorization\u201d from the FDA.\n\nJuul\u2019s popular e-cigarettes have revolutionized the market in the last few years. But the company has been accused of igniting what federal officials have called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of underage vaping. The company has repeatedly said it opposes underage use of its products.\n\nData that became available earlier this month showed a continued surge in vaping among high school students in 2019, after a huge jump in 2018. In addition, a mysterious lung disease that is afflicting vapers has raised alarms among parents and federal health officials.\n\nAt least 530 people have fallen ill, and nine have died as a result of the lung disease. Health officials have not yet announced a link to any specific product, including Juul\u2019s. Many of the vapers apparently used black-market marijuana products, but a smaller percentage said they used regular nicotine vaping products.\n\nTrump, at a White House meeting Sept. 11, said he supports banning almost all flavored e-cigarette products. The Food and Drug Administration is currently hammering out the policy and is expected to issue it in the next several weeks. It will take effect 30 days after it is issued, administration officials have said.\n\nUnder the plan, all flavored e-cigarettes \u2014 except for tobacco-flavored ones \u2014 will have to be taken off the market until they get approval from the FDA, a process that could take months or years.\n\nDuring testimony before a House panel Tuesday, a top official for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that Juul\u2019s high-nicotine products could adversely affect young people whose brains are still developing.\n\n\u201cJuul uses nicotine salts that can cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially have more effect on the developing brain,\u201d said Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the CDC.\n\nJuul, under pressure from the FDA, stopped selling many of its flavored products late last year in retail settings. But it still sells mint and menthol flavors in stores \u2014 and recent data showed that those products have become increasingly popular with young people.\n\nThe company said that Crosthwaite, in his new role, will working with Juul executives to \u201ccontinue a broad review of the company\u2019s practices and policies to ensure alignment with its aim of responsible leadership within the industry.\u201d\n\nCrosthwaite said he has long believed in a future where adult smokers choose alternative products like Juul. But \u201cthat future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate.\u201d\n\nLena H.
