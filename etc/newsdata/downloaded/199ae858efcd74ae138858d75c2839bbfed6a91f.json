Its trade surplus with the US is the biggest imbalance between any two countries. He was riled that China exported electronic products to the US, ignoring the fact a significant amount of the value in these products is actually added in the US, before being sent to China for final assembly.\n\nWill Donald Trump turn to trade if he succeeds in getting a second term? Alamy\n\nHe railed against China for requiring US auto manufacturers (General Motors) to jointly manage the company with Chinese authorities and objected to China\u2019s requirement US IT manufacturers had to hand technology over when establishing in China. Beijing subsequently said it would remove those requirements.\n\nConcern about engagement by Chinese intelligence in US affairs also became a sideline issue. But this is likely to be settled within Political-Military frames, not trade policy.\n\nTrump has signalled to China a partial agreement can be reached on some issues: proposed additional imposts on tariffs on Chinese imports would be parked and in return the US would seek Chinese acceptance of some agricultural exports.\n\nIt should be assumed this would be welcome relief to Beijing (there are signs the US trade restrictions are causing inconvenience) and suggestions China\u2019s growth rate is slipping along with the global economy.\n\nSuch an outcome would work for both the US and China. Trump has begun his re-election campaign. Most US voters are disinterested in trade except for the farm community (which while hurt by blockage of US imports to China still lean towards the President); Trump will also pitch again to steel workers for restricting steel imports although economists point out this will be economically counterproductive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this scenario, trade policy tranquillity could be expected until the next Presidential election. If Trump is re-elected, what then? Trump\u2019s main challenge is he does not understand the economics of trade.\n\nHe has heavily criticised the membership of the WTO for not improving the dispute settlement process which settles trade disputes. He has been careful however not to be overtly anti-WTO. He will seek change, but probably not until after the next election.\n\nWill or can he replicate Obama and elect to join the TPP agreement? This would require him to address some important elements of modern trade agreements today which he has ignored. Electronic commerce fits in that place. Other new issues do not yet figure in his thinking.\n\nThe TPP agreement sets new standards which boost trade and go beyond standard operation in the WTO and most trade agreements. These include investment and expansion of services. Opportunities for US business in Asian Pacific markets would expand.\n\nChina was granted access to the WTO in 2001, the same year the Doha Round of trade reform was launched. But China was not up to date to address the issues in that round. Its application for access was lodged in 1986.\n\nIt now found itself looking through an expanded WTO lenses that it was not geared to deal with.\n\nIt has been the jolting by the Trump Administration that has led China to review where it stands vis-a-vis other WTO members. The Trump Administration is calling the tune, albeit a bit off-key.\n\nIf Trump is truly concerned about China\u2019s trade surplus with the US and is determined to reshape how China manages its trade, he should join the TPP agreement and challenge Beijing to tackle the issues it has so far set aside.\n\nAlan Oxley is principal of ITS Global, former chairman of the GATT and former chairman of the Australian APEC Study Centre.", "description": "The currently mothballed TransPacific Partnership offers a framework to resolve many of the issues in the US-China stand-off.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_65/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d7181a3dfb01689e2d90e1384747cc3376b6b55e", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
