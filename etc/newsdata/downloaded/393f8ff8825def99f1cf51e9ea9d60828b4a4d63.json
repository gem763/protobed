Investigations are under way to determine if the tanker was hit by missiles, which could ratchet up tensions between Tehran and Riyadh if confirmed. emergence of a \"phase 1\" trade deal between the United States and China and a goodwill move by Washington to suspend threatened tariffs on Chinese products also helped to lifted global financial markets on Monday.

This baby-step agreement could take weeks to iron out,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader in a note.\n\nThe trade war has pressure China's trade, with its exports to the United States falling 10.7% from a year earlier in dollar terms over January-September, Chinese customs spokesman Li Kuiwen told reporters. imports from the United States on the other hand have fallen 26.4% in dollar terms during the first nine months.\n\nChina's demand for oil remains strong, however, with its September imports reflecting a 10.8% rise from a year earlier as refiners ramped up output amid stable profit margins and solid fuel demand.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil prices ease on scant details of U.S.-China trade deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAO0V4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
