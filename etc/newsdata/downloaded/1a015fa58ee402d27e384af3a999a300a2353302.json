We\u2019ve been looking for something where we can measure the real impact on the head.\n\n\u2018I could see it being used in boxers\u2019 sparring. If they take some heavy shots, you could call the sparring off for the day or you could rest them up for a couple of days or a week, or until they\u2019ve made a recovery.\n\n\u2018It would give us a better idea of the concussive blows the boxer was taking during sparring because at the moment we have really no idea.\n\n\u2018We haven\u2019t had those discussions with Anthony yet so I can\u2019t say whether he\u2019d be interested or not but I\u2019d like to get him involved.\u2019\n\nJoshua bases his training in Sheffield with his long-time coach McCracken and the rest of the Team GB Boxing team, which includes Loosemore.\n\nSafety in boxing has again come to the forefront of the sport after four tragic deaths since July. Last week American Patrick Day became the latest fighter to lose his life from injuries sustained in the ring after the deaths of Russian Maxim Dadashev, Argentina\u2019s Hugo Santillan and Bulgaria\u2019s Boris Stanchov.\n\nJoshua suffered concussion in his loss to Ruiz Jr (Picture: Getty)\n\nLoosemore believes the new mouthguard might even be used during fights to monitor how a boxer\u2019s health in real time in the ring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You may be able to get to the point where you can say, \u201cHe\u2019s had a certain impact, therefore it\u2019s time to stop the fight\u201d,\u2019 Loosemore said.\n\n\u2018It could change the dynamics of the way the fight was measured because you\u2019d be able to tell if someone was taking a lot of heavy impacts or if they\u2019d taken a very hard impact.\u2019\n\nMORE: Tyson Fury ambushed by Braun Strowman during WWE training session", "description": "Team GB's chief medical officer Mike Loosemore has urged Anthony Joshua to tackle his concussion issues by using a new mouthguard.
