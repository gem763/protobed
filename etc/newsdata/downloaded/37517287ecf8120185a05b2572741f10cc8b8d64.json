(AP) - The Daniel Jones era is off to a rousing start for the New York Giants.\n\nThe rookie quarterback threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns and also ran for two TDs, including the go-ahead score with 1:16 remaining as the Giants rallied from an 18-point halftime deficit to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-31 on Sunday.\n\nJameis Winston threw for 380 yards and put the Bucs (1-2) in position to pull out a dramatic win, but rookie Matt Gay\u2019s 34-yard field goal sailed wide right as time expired.\n\nJones scored on a 7-yard run in the second quarter and put the Giants ahead with another 7-yarder on fourth-and-goal. The sixth pick in this year\u2019s draft began New York\u2019s comeback with a 75-yard TD pass to Evan Engram on the first play of the second half, and a 7-yarder to Sterling Shepard midway through the third quarter.\n\nWinston threw TD passes of 21, 3 and 20 yards to Mike Evans to help Tampa Bay build a 28-10 halftime lead. His 44-yard completion to the Giants 9 set up the last-second field goal try by Gay, who also missed an extra point and had another blocked.\n\nJones, making his first NFL start in place of benched two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, completed 23 of 36 passes. With Saquon Barkley exiting with a right ankle injury late in the first half, Jones also led the Giants with 28 yards rushing on four attempts.\n\nAs impressive as the former Duke standout was, he was not perfect. Shaquil Barrett had four of Tampa Bay\u2019s five sacks and forced a fumble that led to a field goal that put Tampa Bay up 31-25 with six minutes to go.\n\nJones also lost a fumble that led to one of Winston\u2019s TD passes to Evans, who finished with eight catches for 190 yards.\n\nEngram\u2019s long catch and run was the highlight of a six-catch, 113-yard performance. Shepard, back in the lineup after missing the previous game with a concussion, had seven catches for 100 yards, including a 36-yarder that set up the winning touchdown.\n\nJones played one series in New York\u2019s season-opening loss to Dallas. Manning replaced Kurt Warner after the ninth game of his rookie season in 2004 and started 232 of New York\u2019s next 233 regular-season games. The Giants averaged 420 yards on offense in the first two games this year, but only scored four touchdowns while averaging 15.5 points.\n\nThe 38-year-old Manning was Jones\u2019 backup, but did not accompany New York\u2019s other captains to midfield for the pregame coin toss.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGiants: LB Alec Ogletree left in the second quarter after injuring a hamstring during his runback of a fumble that was later reversed by replay and ruled an incomplete pass. \u2026 Barkley limped off the field with a little over three minutes remaining before halftime and was on crutches afterward. \u2026 LB Tae Davis left with a concussion in the second half.\n\nBuccaneers: ILB Devin White, the fifth pick in the draft, was inactive due to a knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGiants: return home to face NFC East rival Washington next Sunday\n\nBuccaneers: at Los Angeles Rams, beginning stretch in which they won\u2019t play at home again until Nov. 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Daniel Jones era is off to a rousing start for the New York Giants.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/aptopix_giants_buccaneers_football_15487_c0-227-4687-2959_s1770x1032.jpg?6c7d2145b0edd3ef6ecaef5879bc17add0582189", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
