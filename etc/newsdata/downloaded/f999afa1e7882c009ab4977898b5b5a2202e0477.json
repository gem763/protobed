We're going to have to look at all the legal aspects,\" she said.\n\nMr Riester said Google's stance was \"obviously not acceptable,\" adding he would consult his European counterparts on a response.\n\nThe EU directive must \"ensure a fair share of the value produced by media content for internet platforms,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it was \"at the disposal to the French government to support the transposition of the directive,\" reiterating that member states have until June 7, 2021 to enforce it.\n\nHIGH STAKES\n\nThe legislation seeks to ensure media firms are paid for original content displayed by Google, Facebook and other technology giants which dominate the online advertising market.\n\nThe new rules create \"neighbouring rights\" to ensure a form of copyright protection - and compensation - for media firms when their content is used on websites such as search engines.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Google said that in Europe alone it sends more than eight billion visits to news publisher websites each month.\n\nBut news publishers, including AFP, have countered that the copyright changes were urgently needed to help them cope with plummeting revenues as readers migrate online.\n\nRefusing to allow Google permission to show pictures, videos or parts of articles could deal a further blow, since internet users are far more likely to click on results containing excerpts and images.\n\nThe new EU directive was passed last March amid fierce resistance from tech companies which generate huge profits from advertising shown alongside search results and other content they host.\n\nGoogle had warned after the European Parliament vote that the change would \"lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe's creative and digital economies.\"\n\nCritics also said the reform would effectively create a \"link tax\" that would restrict internet discourse, and did not strike the best balance between free circulation of information and copyright protection.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [PARIS] Google said on Wednesday it will not pay European media outlets for displaying their articles, pictures and videos in search results in France, a move that undercuts EU copyright law and could set up a legal fight between the US tech giant and Brussels. .
