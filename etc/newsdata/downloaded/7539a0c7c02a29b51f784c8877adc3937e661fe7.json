Drone fighter jets, hypersonic attack planes, artificial intelligence, lasers, electronic warfare and sensors woven into the fuselage of an aircraft - are all areas of current technological exploration for the Air Force as it begins early prototyping for a new, 6th-Generation fighter jet to emerge in the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nWhile the initiative, called Next Generation Air Dominance(NGAD), has been largely conceptual for years, Air Force officials say current \u201cprototyping\u201d and \u201cdemonstrations\u201d are informing which technologies the service will invest in for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have completed an analysis of alternatives and our acquisition team is working on the requirements. We are pretty deep into experimenting with hardware and software technologies that will help us control and exploit air power into the future,\u201d Gen. James Holmes, Commander, Air Combat Command, told reporters at the Association of the Air Force Air, Space and Cyber Conference.\n\nPart of the progress with the program, according to Air Force Acquisition Executive William Roper, is due to new methods of digital engineering.\n\n\u201cI have spent six months with our industry leaders and NGAD team looking at examples of applied digital engineering. I\u2019m impressed with what they have done,\u201d Roper.\n\nDigital engineering, as Roper explains it, brings what could be called a two-fold advantage. It enables weapons developers to assess technologies, material configurations and aircraft models without needing to build all of them -- all while paradoxically enabling builders to \u201cbend metal\u201d and start building prototypes earlier than would otherwise be possible.\n\n\u201cThe reward is more than the risk,\u201d Roper said, speaking of the need to \u201ctry something different\u201d and pursue newer acquisition methods which at times results in prototyping earlier in the process than the traditional process typically involves.\n\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory has been working with the acquisition community on digital engineering techniques, often explored through modeling and simulation, for many years.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Will it change warfare?", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A04YapTNxFTNXZVx4i8XKQ--~B/aD0xMDI5O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b6183c9046302ae895c23e0d74fdf0a9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
