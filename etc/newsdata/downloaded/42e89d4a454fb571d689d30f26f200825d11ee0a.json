Miller, a veteran prop master. It\u2019s a funny thing for the guy behind Cast Away\u2019s Wilson and Ocean\u2019s Thirteen\u2019s Chunnel drill to say, but there you have it. He, like many of his peers, understands that most of his work occurs behind the scenes, in the locating, purchasing, building, and supervising of all the props required for a film or TV production. (A prop, in the simplest of terms, is any object the actors handle or touch onscreen; if it\u2019s just part of the backdrop, the object is the responsibility of the set decorator.) It\u2019s a role that requires immense research, hyperniche handiwork, an obsessive\u2019s flare for detail, and a tolerance for people overlooking all that work. Oh, and a big truck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally a rolling office and fabrication place,\u201d says Miller of the 50-foot semi-trailer that houses all of the props and prop materials he might need. Every prop master has one. (The Blacklist\u2019s prop master, Courtney Schmidt, affectionately calls hers \u201cTrash Mountain.\u201d) In Miller\u2019s truck are \u201cdrawers of different styles of knives from different periods,\u201d among many, many other things.\n\nHoarding is necessary in a line of work that entails highly specialized problem-solving on the go. \u201cWhen I get a script, we break [it] down. We make massive numbers of lists,\u201d says prop master Trish Gallaher Glenn, who worked on The American President and The Social Network. \u201cI\u2019ll sit down and have a meeting with the director and go through the whole script and ask all the questions I have. \u2018Do you want this or do you want that?\u2019\u201d It requires the prop master to be in constant contact not just with key members of the crew, but with the stars, as well. \u201cWe have relationships with the actors that no one else has,\u201d says Miller. \u201cBecause we\u2019re there every day with them, teaching them how to use these things. They may not know how to handle a gun.\u201d\n\nSome prop masters do specialize in certain objects or film genres \u2014 say, big gun movies \u2014 but most are versatile, flitting between genres and centuries. And they all adore period pieces, when the prop master\u2019s job becomes an exercise in preventing anachronisms. \u201cWe all love to do period shows. You have to go out and find all these things,\u201d says Miller. \u201c[With] a contemporary show, basically, you can shop it. And that\u2019s not as interesting.\u201d When Gallaher Glenn worked on Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, she spent most of her time tracking down random 19th-century objects of interest.\n\n\u201cWe would have people get up in the middle of the night who spoke French,\u201d she recalls, \u201cwho could call a department store in Paris that might have a specific item \u2014 like a shaving brush \u2014 that looked correct for 1897, when the movie was set.\u201d\n\nLike most segments of entertainment, the job of a prop master has changed substantially with the rise of the internet. \u201cNow I can just open my computer and start looking at Etsy and eBay,\u201d Gallaher Glenn notes. But over the years, prop masters say their jobs have been constrained, too: Budgets have become tighter, major studios have exerted more control, and prestige TV has transformed the industry, offering longer-term contracts \u2014 and tighter turnaround, too. Some prop masters are wistful for the old days of independent cinema, before CGI.\n\n\u201cYou had a van and a bunch of tools and you made almost everything you needed for the script,\u201d says Miller. \u201cAnd that was fine, because it was so low-budget. Now that props have evolved into what they\u2019ve become, you need a shop, technicians. I kind of miss those old days, when a director and actor called for something and you could just go, \u2018Give me ten minutes and we\u2019ll see what we can throw together.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere, prop designers wax nostalgic on the hardest props of their careers:\n\nCast Away (2000), Wilson the volleyball\n\nRobin L. Miller, property master: There were very specific things in Cast Away that were so important to the script. A lot of times, the props are there for an actor; they don\u2019t have to be the star. Unless it\u2019s scripted that you should notice Wilson.\n\nIt was very strange because I approached representatives of the company [Wilson Sporting Goods], and they were not interested at all. It just didn\u2019t matter to them. I told them, \u201cYou know, we have Tom Hanks here. We have Robert Zemeckis, who did Back to the Future. We have this venue for this ball of yours that is incredible. And it\u2019s named Wilson.\u201d They were very polite, but not interested. I told them, \u201cWe\u2019re depicting your product. It\u2019s a wonderful character in this movie, and it saves this man\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nAt some point, I called back and got some kind of great sales rep. And she got it. She understood exactly what this was. She said, \u201cLet me see what I can do.\u201d They had to make them specially. I needed the \u201cWilson\u201d only on one side of the ball. I needed to do a face on the other side. Apparently they were made in China. They had to do a special run of them. She would only give me 20. I went, \u201c20? I\u2019m going to Fiji with these things!\u201d And I needed as many as I could get, because things happen to props all the time. They get wrecked. They get misplaced. Everything we took to Fiji, we had to have there with us when we shot. \u2019Cause there was no getting anything else.\n\nShe only could make me 20. And we made do with that. They made it through the storm, so to speak.\n\nCharlie Wilson\u2019s War (2007), the newspaper on 9/11\n\nTrish Gallaher Glenn, property master: At the end of Charlie Wilson\u2019s War, Charlie was supposed to be reading the Washington Post on the day that the planes crashed, and he can actually see in the distance the planes crashing into the Pentagon. We wanted either the Washington Post or the New York Times \u2014 we wanted both of them, pre-crash, on September 11. And no one had them, because the whole infrastructure fell apart that day. The Post didn\u2019t have them. The New York Times. None of the libraries. We could not find them anywhere. We actually ran ads. You could find millions of copies of after the planes hit, but you could not find the morning paper that Charlie would have been reading that day.\n\nOddly enough, one of the women who worked in Charlie\u2019s office, her husband was a writer for the Washington Post. And he had an article that appeared not on the front page that day, but he\u2019d saved a copy of the paper. That\u2019s how we found it. And then we reproduced it from that. It was at the very end of the shoot that we needed it. We had a pretty long prep, but we looked and looked and looked and we exhausted every resource. No one had it. But we found it.\n\nA lot of times, those things that we spend a lot of time on \u2014 maybe it doesn\u2019t actually matter to a lot of people if it\u2019s accurate. We probably could have created a Washington Post if we\u2019d been able to get permission, and no one would have known the difference. But for me and for the people that do my job, it\u2019s having the exact right thing that gives us the thrill.\n\nThe Blacklist (2013\u20132015), a dog\n\nCourtney Schmidt, property master: I had a really interesting experience once when I was on The Blacklist. I also handle cars, vehicles, animals, weapons \u2014 things like that. This is a scene where Raymond Reddington [played by James Spader] was coming. He was supposed to talk about this dog that has huge testicles. The producers looked at me ahead of time like, \u201cWhatever you do, just get the oldest dog possible. We do not want this thing to move. We want it to be lazy as hell. Just get the oldest thing possible.\u201d\n\nSo I did. On the day, dog\u2019s there, James is acting. And he looks down and stops in the middle of the shoot. He says out loud, \u201cDoes anybody notice this dog\u2019s distinct lack of balls?\u201d And I was like, Oh God, here we go. He likes everything real, which I respect. So he stops, pulls me over, and he\u2019s like: \u201cExcuse me, but if I\u2019m gonna talk about a dog\u2019s balls, I want to see the balls on the dog.\u201d We\u2019re not shooting the dog\u2019s balls. But he basically ended up giving me a ten-minute lecture on dog balls. That was a really fun day for me. Note to self: Get a dog with balls.\n\nAirplane! (1980), the fish skeleton\n\nSteven Levine, property master: If you remember, there was a scene where anybody [on the plane] who ate the fish got sick. And Peter Graves, who was the pilot, ate the fish \u2014 they did an insert of his plate showing a skeleton. Like, he picked it clean, right? So I wound up contacting a museum. I paid, I dunno, $350 or something for this fish skeleton. And it looked great! Well, this assistant director found out how much I spent, and then he started passing around, \u201cYou know how much Levine spent on that fish? All he had to do was \u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t even his business! Fuck you! \u2026 He kinda threw me under the bus. But I don\u2019t look at Airplane! as anything but a great accomplishment.\n\nPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure (1985), the breakaway bottles\n\nLevine: It was a weekend. Like a Saturday afternoon. I was at home. And I get a call from Paul Reubens and Tim Burton: On Monday we were going to be shooting in a tequila bar, where all those bikers were at the bar. And Pee-wee was doing a dance with those giant white platform shoes to the song \u201cTequila.\u201d They decided that they wanted Pee-wee to pick up a bunch of beer pitchers and beer glasses and throw them and smash them, during the song. So they tell me this on a Saturday afternoon! To shoot on Monday morning! I told them, \u201cLook. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if I can pull this off or not. But I\u2019m gonna go work on it now.\u201d\n\nTo cut to the chase, I lined \u2019em up. I got a shop that builds breakaway props. They had them in stock, so they didn\u2019t have to be made. I got them to open up early on Monday morning. And I called the transportation department and had a driver pick them up and deliver them to our set. I arranged all of it, and they were there Monday morning at call time.\n\nOf course, they were very happy that I did that. But the studio was not happy that I did that! They were angry. I spent a thousand dollars and I didn\u2019t get their approval. So I got called into the office, and the guy \u2014 he was the head of feature production over there for a long time \u2014 he told me, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever spend our money without checking with me first.\u201d I suppose in retrospect, I can sort of see where he was coming from. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t see that at all at the time. I said back to him, \u201cWell, maybe I should have charged you for my time on the weekend! To put all this shit together! It was the star and director who asked me to pull this off, and I did.\u201d I fought right back to his face.\n\nAt that point, I made a decision. I can either please the studio and not continue to deliver the quality of props I was delivering, or I can ignore the studio and continue to please Paul Reubens and Tim Burton. And I made a conscious decision: I\u2019m going for them. Even if it costs the studio more money. My training was, it\u2019s all about the director\u2019s vision.\n\nIt turns out that that film made bazillions of dollars. It\u2019s a cult classic. And they hassled me from day one till wrap. They made it so hard.\n\nThe Social Network (2010), Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal laptops\n\nGallaher Glenn: It\u2019s funny, because we live in such a disposable culture now that everything gets thrown away. Nobody would think to save a laptop from 2003. They\u2019re throwaway items now. Whereas maybe a typewriter from the 1920s \u2014 there are people who collect those items. No one wants to save things that we all look at. If you do a project that\u2019s [set in] 2007, even, it\u2019s hard to find the cell phones because we\u2019ve thrown it all away.\n\nOn Social Network, we wanted to find the exact items. Whenever we could find out what exact computer they had \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have any cooperation with any of the real people we were portraying \u2014 if we would find an image, we would latch onto it, find those exact ones. We also went on internet searches, where we would look at advertisements from computer magazines from that time period and see what the most popular models were. We had to get multiples of everything because with that kind of technology, something might work for an hour and a half and then all of a sudden, bloop, screen\u2019s black and you send it to the repair shop and put the next one in.\n\nThere were different ones that [Mark Zuckerberg] used for different things. There were three: There was one that he used early on in the dorm. He had two different laptops for that. I think we probably tried to get between four and six of those. Then there\u2019s a scene later in the film, where a laptop gets smashed. On that one, we may have gotten somewhere between 12 and 18 of those. We were ready to put them back together, because [David] Fincher likes to do a lot of takes. So you always have to be prepared to be able to do something many, many, many times for him.\n\nMy recollection is that we found a picture of [Zuckerberg] in the Harvard Crimson. We were able to identify not only his laptop, but also his roommate\u2019s. I think we found images of those computers, or in an article, it may have stated exactly. He happened to have a Sony early on. We found multiples of those. Later, when Facebook was up and running, they switched over to Apple products. We found stuff in blogs, too, about what computers [they used]. I have a team of people that all are working on things. Most of the time we also have a full-time researcher. They sometimes will find that information. All of the laptops that Mark used, we found evidence of exactly what they were.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), the pastry box\n\nMiller: I did Grand Budapest Hotel, which is one of the most creative things you can ever do. To work with Wes Anderson is just insane \u2014 the level of his interest in everything visual. Every single prop in that was a design or fabrication.\n\nThe box that has the pastry in it, the beautiful pink box \u2014 it took so much work to create that. Oh my God. Because everything you do with Wes, he starts out with an image, or maybe four images. And he\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s getting closer to. And then you take it from there and you refine it a little more. Then he\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, I like this, but maybe here for a shape.\u201d And then you just keep going until you\u2019ve got the shape. Color-wise, palette-wise, he knows color like crazy.\n\n[For] the graphics, he has a wonderful woman who works with him [Annie Atkins]. She\u2019s been with him on a number of shows. What he had her do [is] come up with concepts for that box. The ribbon. I had samples from, I don\u2019t know, four or five European cities. I was getting every sample imaginable of this blue ribbon. Just to see what was perfect for the lighting and the texture and the shade. The box was this kind of blush pink. Not to mention, it had to be rigged. Then a version of it had to be made that all came open at once into different pieces and reassemble itself. I had a brilliant crew in Berlin who could figure that one out.\n\nIt\u2019s unbelievable what went into that. And we ended up with that wonderful, perfect box.\n\nApollo 13 (1995), assorted Mission Control accessories and flight manuals\n\nLevine: The whole film was challenging because it was period. We shot it in 1995 and it took place in 1970. There was a ton of research involved. I went to NASA in Houston. I went to a place called Kansas Cosmosphere \u2014 I think it\u2019s called Cosmosphere now. At that time, they were making all the replica capsules for the Smithsonian Museum. You gotta find all of those period eyeglasses. In Mission Control, most men back then wore different types \u2014 actually more similar types of all-black framed eyeglasses. And then all the specific things that were in their little pocket packs. They used a lot of slide rules and mechanical pencils, and also each department in Mission Control had different forms of ID. So you had to be very specific to be certain that the character in the role he was playing had the proper type of identification slipped onto his shirt.\n\nSteven Levine on the set of Apollo 13. Photo: Courtesy of Steven Levine\n\nOh, I had to recreate all those flight manuals. So I got the research from NASA, and then I started the task of farming out having all of those recreated. Our technical advisor, Dave Scott, who was on another Apollo mission, who actually walked on the moon, came out and complimented me on how well everything that I\u2019d presented [looked], and specifically the flight manuals. He said that was an amazing task and that they were flawless. When he walked back on the set, I stood outside for a second, and I looked up at the moon. And I said to myself, Wow, I just got a compliment from a guy that walked up there! That was a proud moment.\n\nAngels & Demons (2009), the ring\n\nGallaher Glenn: Angels & Demons had tons of really interesting props. Some of the things that we did were based on a lot of research about the church. Other parts were completely made up and fantastical. Even props that are ultimately science fiction or completely made up, there\u2019s always some basis that grounds it to reality. I think that\u2019s really important. The actors eventually are going to use it. You want to have a logic behind what you do, what you make.\n\nWe made the pope\u2019s ring. In the opening sequence of that movie, there\u2019s a scene where they\u2019re smashing the ring after the pope has died. They wanted to do a reflection shot. So first of all, we had to design a pope ring. That had to go through all kinds of clearance to make sure we weren\u2019t copying anyone else\u2019s work. When they wanted to do that reflection shot, the best way to do it was to build a ring that was very oversized. So we built the replica of that ring that would literally slide on my upper arm. That\u2019s how big it was.\n\nThat movie had a lot of inserts of secret coded messages in the sides of ancient documents. All those ancient documents we created. Some of them, again, we made really, really large. Just for camera reasons. In insert shots, it was easier to do it that way than to try and shoot the tiny little ones we originally made.\n\nRush (1991), the drugs\n\nLevine: It was a film about two undercover cops that became hooked on drugs. The hard stuff was the simulating of the drugs.\n\nSo I hooked up with an ex-junkie in L.A. who I knew. He had been clean for a while. He worked with Jennifer [Jason Leigh] and Jason [Patric]. He made all my prop heroin to make it look like it was heroin. Coffee grounds was part of the ingredients. I think we used a cocaine substitute. I don\u2019t know if you can buy this stuff anymore, but I bought a lot of that stuff they cut it with to make it go further. I used a lot of that. To make the brown heroin, I think he added coffee grounds to that. But he worked with them showing them how to bend the spoon, how to cook it. He went over how you shoot up. When we got to Texas, we had a guy who ran a recovery home take over for my friend in L.A. He then became the technical guy. He was an ex-junkie. He was with us for all the drug use.\n\nThere was one particular prop, called the Blue Ringer. It was some kind of narcotic pill. For most of the pills, I found this magazine called High Times. They simulated these pills called Black Beauties, which were uppers and quaaludes. Anyway, I bought all of the pills and that kind of stuff from High Times magazine. I couldn\u2019t find anything to simulate these Blue Ringers. So I bought my Texas assistant all these capsules and all that cut that they put into the cocaine, and he had to fill a cigar box by hand \u2014 each capsule. He had to fill it with the powder and then take some of that thin blue tape and wrap it around the center. That took him a few days, to make up all of those pills.\n\nThe Addams Family (1991), the dinner\n\nMiller: I did the first Addams Family. We had Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1 on that \u2014 wonderful, wonderful actor. We had the food scenes. They had to eat squid and octopus and eyeballs and things like that. Mostly, I found things that approximated this food. Really, I was doing all my own food for that. This poor guy had to do an entire day of eating tentacles in this green, very unappetizing thing that I had put a ton of garlic in, because he wanted garlic to mask the flavor. By the end of the day, he said he\u2019ll never eat calamari again.\n\nCocoon (1985), the \u201caliens\u2019 box\u201d\n\nLevine: We called it the aliens\u2019 box. In the two scenes it was featured prominently in, it was sort of the center of the scene. The aliens could monitor the life force in the cocoons by this electrical box. It was made out of very dark plexiglass. You wouldn\u2019t see anything until the operator, with a remote control, operated the different windows and doors in this box. The box functioned beautifully. It was an amazing piece of art. It was all done off-camera by remote control. All the lights.\n\nIt was my fourth film. Even though I was doing well, I still had lessons to learn. What I should have done was have the box made by the special-effects department, and then the two effects men that were on the show would have known how to operate it. But they didn\u2019t say anything to me, and I didn\u2019t have the forethought to think, \u201cWell, if I have the box built somewhere else, they\u2019re gonna have to bring the operator to Florida to operate this thing.\u201d\n\nSteven Levine on set with Ron Howard. Photo: Courtesy of Steven Levine\n\nWhen it got to Florida and the operator came, [director] Ron Howard, and Richard and Lili Zanuck \u2014 who were the producers \u2014 wanted to finally see it, because it was scheduled to work a few days after it arrived. Now, for an overflow prop room, I had a motel room next to where the crew stayed. The box was located there with a lot of my extra stuff. They came to see the box operate. The guy that built it ran it through its paces. And they were very pleased.\n\nThen they left, and we were congratulating each other on how awesome the show-and-tell went. The operator who built it, his name was Harvey. So we popped a beer and clinked it like, Wow, we really pulled this off! And Harvey says, \u201cListen, I want to test one more thing.\u201d So he tests the flashing lights. And the box caught on fire! Flames! Shooting out of the top of this box! I just saw my entire efforts shot down the drain. Right in front of me, the box is on fire. I immediately called the fire department and they came rushing over. By then \u2014 and I don\u2019t even remember how \u2014 we had moved the box to the back room and I was in the front room. Harvey put the fire out. At this point, the top of the box was deformed. Obviously, the lights were not functioning in the upper half of the box.\n\nI looked at Harvey and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you have to do, man. This box has to function in three days. And if you don\u2019t have that done, we are both straight down the shoot.\u201d And he did it! I don\u2019t even remember how. When that box made it to the set, it operated like a charm. That was probably the most difficult prop [of my career].\n\nFor any other prop masters who have a great hardest prop story to share, let us know at stories@vulture.com.", "description": "Hollywood\u2019s veteran property masters explain 12 props that made their careers, including stories about Castaway, Airplane!, Cocoon, Rush, Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure, Apollo 13 and more.", "authors": ["Zach Schonfeld"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-how-it-works-prop-master-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
