(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday asked a federal judge to block the Manhattan district attorney from subpoenaing President Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 at least temporarily while Trump sues to have the subpoena dismissed.\n\nLast month, Trump sued District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. (D) in federal court, trying to stop a subpoena Vance\u2019s office had sent to Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s longtime accountants. Vance is seeking eight years of tax returns for Trump and his business as part of an investigation into hush-money payments made during the 2016 campaign.\n\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero put the subpoena on hold while waiting for the Justice Department response to arrive.\n\nIn its filing, the Justice Department said Trump was right to bring the suit in federal court, not state court. It asked Marrero to keep the subpoena on hold for longer, to allow for more detailed arguments about the \u201cweighty constitutional issues involved\u201d in the case.\n\n\u201cDoing so will prevent irreparable harm to the President\u2019s asserted constitutional interest in not having his records subjected to state criminal compulsory process in these circumstances,\u201d said the filing, signed by Justice Department officials in Washington and New York.\n\nMarrero is expected to rule in the next few days, deciding whether the subpoena should go forward or remain on hold while Trump\u2019s lawsuit is heard.\n\nVance\u2019s investigation is focused on payments made before the 2016 election to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, two women who said they had affairs with Trump. He has denied having relationships with the women.\n\nTrump\u2019s former attorney and \u201cfixer\u201d Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for helping to arrange those payments. Cohen said he had been reimbursed $420,000 by the Trump Organization. Federal prosecutors later effectively concluded their investigation without charging anyone else at the company.\n\nAfter that, Vance\u2019s office \u2014 which has the power to bring charges in New York state courts \u2014 began asking for documents related to the payments, as well as seeking tax returns for Trump and his businesses from Mazars.\n\nTrump\u2019s private attorneys sued Vance and Mazars in federal court, seeking to stop the subpoena.\n\nTheir logic was sweeping: that Trump was immune from any criminal investigation \u2014 of any kind, by any prosecutor \u2014 while president.\n\n\u201cThe Framers eliminated this possibility, and assigned the task to . . . Congress\u201d through the impeachment process, Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. They asked a judge to stop the subpoena: \u201cBecause [Vance\u2019s] subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting president, it is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s office argued that Trump\u2019s attorneys were stretching presidential immunity far beyond what any court had intended.\n\nTrump, Vance\u2019s office said, is seeking to \u201cinvent and enforce a new presidential \u2018tax return privilege\u2019 \u201d that would bar anyone from seeing his returns. \u201cNo such privilege exists in the law,\u201d Vance\u2019s office wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department filing did not mention the sweeping assertion of presidential privilege made by Trump\u2019s private attorneys. Instead, it focused on a more narrow procedural issue \u2014 rejecting an argument made by Vance that this was a state-level matter that did not belong in federal court.\n\n\u201cThe President is undoubtedly entitled to review in federal court when the state prosecutor seeks his records directly from him,\u201d the Justice Department filing said. \u201cThe President should not lose access to that federal forum simply because the President\u2019s records are sought from a third-party custodian\u201d like Mazars, the filing said.", "description": "In its filing, the department also said President Trump was right to bring the suit in federal court, not state court.", "authors": ["David A.
