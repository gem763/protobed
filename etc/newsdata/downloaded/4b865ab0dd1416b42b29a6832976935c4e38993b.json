Rex and Thin Lizzy.\n\nReturning nominees include Depeche Mode, Judas Priest, Kraftwerk, MC5, Nine Inch Nails, Rufus featuring Chaka Khan and Todd Rundgren.\n\nGerman band Kraftwerk, described in its nomination biography as \"the foundation upon which all synthesizer-based rock and electronic dance music is built,\" is under consideration for the sixth time, while MC5 (short for Motor City 5), a '60s band known for its garage-rock anthems, is a five-time nominee.\n\nLegendary rapper Notorious B.I.G. is a first-time nominee for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
