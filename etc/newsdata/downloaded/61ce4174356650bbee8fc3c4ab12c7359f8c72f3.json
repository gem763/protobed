It was an ugly sight to see, but as analysts are learning right about now, the present resistance level is still at around $8,100 given that the currency has jumped back up to this position within the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin Is About to Get Bigger\n\nThe volatility that has been striking the coin over the past ten years \u2013 yes, it\u2019s been vulnerable to price swings since it first emerged in the financial space \u2013 is far from over. The crypto bloodbath that occurred roughly two weeks ago is proof of that, but what we\u2019re witnessing is that while volatility is still a prominent problem, bitcoin has learned how to consistently pick itself back up again. For example, rather than stay below $8,000 for several days like it did when it first encountered this drop, the currency hopped back up within a much shorter period.\n\nOne of the reasons for the sudden fall may be because bitcoin is preparing to shoot beyond what anybody thought possible in 2020, a year that\u2019s right around the corner. A recent report published by Bayerische Landesbank in Germany suggests that everyone\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency could wind up reaching the $90,000 mark by May of next year.\n\nThis is partly due to the halving that\u2019s set to take place, an event that doesn\u2019t happen all that often for bitcoin. What happens is that the rewards for bitcoin miners are literally cut in half, and thus the process of mining becomes a little more complicated and takes more time. The currency becomes \u201crarer\u201d for lack of a better word, thereby causing present amounts to become pricier. It\u2019s another example of bitcoin serving as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\nThe bank took what\u2019s known as a \u201cstock-to-flow approach\u201d to reach the $90,000 figure it\u2019s predicting. This approach ultimately measures the \u201chardness\u201d of an asset; not it\u2019s physical hardness (as bitcoin is digital), but rather how tough it becomes towards elements that might strike its price in a negative way.\n\n2020 Will Be a Serious Turning Point\n\nIt is probably safe to assume that the bank believes bitcoin will show much stronger resistance to price swings. Interestingly, gold has a considerably high stock-to-flow ratio at 58, but the bank believes bitcoin will potentially overtake that in just the next few months alone.\n\nEither way, 2020 is poised to be a big year for the currency considering eccentric software expert and millionaire John McAfee is going further than the bank\u2019s initial prediction and claiming that the currency could spike as high as $1 million per unit. No doubt the presidential election of that year will also have a major impact on the currency just like it did in 2016 (the currency spiked ferociously following the election of Donald Trump that November).", "description": "Bitcoin is proving vulnerable to price swings still, but it could potentially hit $90,000 in 2020 according to a German bank.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/12/ss-bitcoin-trading-chart.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
