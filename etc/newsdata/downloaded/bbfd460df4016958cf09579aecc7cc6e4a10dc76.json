Net income rose 19% to $6.09 billion, or $2.12 a share, Facebook said Wednesday in a statement. That beat predictions for $1.91 in per-share profit. Monthly average users at the Facebook app reached 2.45 billion, matching estimates. Shares jumped about 5% in late trading following the news.\n\nFacebook is under antitrust investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and a broad group of U.S. state attorneys general. The probes haven\u2019t scared off advertisers, though, and sales jumped to the company\u2019s highest ever for any single quarter. Facebook\u2019s growth is likely being fueled in part by ads inside its Instagram photo-sharing app. Research firm EMarketer estimates Instagram will generate more than $15 billion in ad revenue this year, up from $9.1 billion in 2018, though Facebook doesn\u2019t break out results from that business.\n\nInstagram is also rolling out a shopping feature, and on a conference call Wednesday Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said there\u2019s a nascent commerce effort across all of Facebook\u2019s properties.\n\nFacebook shares rose as high as $200 in extended trading. Earlier, they had slipped less than 1% to $188.25 in regular New York trading. The stock has gained 44% this year.\n\nSeparately, Facebook also said Susan Desmond-Hellmann, the company\u2019s lead independent director, is stepping down from the board. Desmond-Hellmann has been on the panel since 2013, and has been lead director since 2015. In a statement, she cited \u201cincreasing demands\u201d from her role running the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, her family and her health as reasons for her resignation. The company said it will name Desmond-Hellmann\u2019s replacement in the coming months.\n\nOn the earnings call, Facebook executives pointed to ads in Stories, where posts disappear after 24 hours, as one of the key growth areas for the company\u2019s business, though Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg reiterated what she has said in past quarters: Stories ads still aren\u2019t as expensive as some other kinds of Facebook ads. \u201cStories still don\u2019t monetize at the same rate as News Feed right now,\u201d Sandberg said.\n\nFinance chief Dave Wehner said that in the short term, that probably won\u2019t change. He said that Stories revenue will increase because of more ad impressions, not necessary higher prices.\n\nThe upbeat earnings are a positive bit of news from a company that has been under fire almost constantly for the past three years. Facebook\u2019s most recent controversy centers on its handling of political advertisements ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election -- a small part of Facebook\u2019s overall business. Facebook has said it won\u2019t fact-check posts from politicians, including ads, because the company doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for deciding what is true. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company\u2019s position, citing principles of free speech and a desire to let people decide for themselves in a broad marketplace of ideas.\n\nOne consequence is that political candidates can lie in their ads, and pay Facebook to promote those ads more widely to its users. On Tuesday, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat of Virginia, joined the list of politicians decrying the company\u2019s policy, joining presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who have also called on the company to change its stance on fact-checking political ads.\n\nOn Wednesday, smaller social-media rival Twitter Inc. announced that it will ban political advertising from its platform starting next month. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that \u201cpolitical message reach should be earned, not bought.\u201d\n\nOn a conference call with executives following the report, Zuckerberg addressed the company\u2019s recent controversies, including the political ads policy. He pushed back on recent criticism about the company\u2019s decisions, saying that Facebook is \u201cat a crossroads.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect that this is going to be a very tough year. We try to do what we think is right but we\u2019re not going to get everything right,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone can say that we\u2019re not doing what we believe, or that we haven\u2019t thought hard enough about these issues.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.\u2019s third-quarter sales rose a better-than-projected 29%, weathering a period full of regulatory challenges and criticism by boosting advertising revenue and adding 35 million new users to its main social network.Sales reached $17.7 billion, topping the $17.4 billion average", "authors": ["Kurt Wagner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
