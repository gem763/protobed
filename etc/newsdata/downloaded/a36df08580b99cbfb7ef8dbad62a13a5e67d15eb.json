Anyone on the street who refuses to remove a face mask when asked to do so by a police officer will be liable to up to six months in prison, it said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Ms Lam was flanked at the news conference by all 16 of her cabinet ministers, the first such display since she was sworn in as chief executive in July 2017.\n\nLegal experts have warned that invoking emergency laws will give the chief executive free rein to bypass the city\u2019s legislature and make any regulations she considers in the public interest.\n\nOn Friday morning, amid widespread media reports of the impending ban, people were already taking to the streets to march in face masks as a sign of defiance.\n\n\"After so many months the government has refused to answer our demands,\" said one protester, who asked to be identified as just Chan, at a demonstration in the city's Central district.\n\n\"Police brutality is becoming more serious and the set up of an anti-mask law is to threaten us from protesting,\" the 27-year-old financial industry worker told Reuters.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
