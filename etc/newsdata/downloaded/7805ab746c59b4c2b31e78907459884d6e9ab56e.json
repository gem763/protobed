Mr. Pompeo also expressed a hope the two sides would \u201cfind a way to work through\u201d it.\n\nBut other U.S. officials expressed unease. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia Alice Wells told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in June that Washington had \u201cserious concerns\u201d over New Delhi\u2019s S-400 pursuit, saying it could \u201climit\u201d expanding U.S.-India defense ties.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, a strategic choice has to be made about partnerships and a strategic choice about what weapons systems and platforms a country is going to adopt,\u201d Ms. Wells said, according to The Diplomat.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the Trump administration will proceed.\n\nThe 2017 Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) calls for sanctions on nations making significant weapons buys from the Russians. New Delhi inked a $5 billion contract for several S-400 systems last year, with the first system coming online in 2020.\n\nBut CAATSA allows a president to waive the sanctions for U.S. allies, as long as he can prove they have an expanding military relationship and are decreasing their overall weapons imports from Russia.\n\nAdministration officials have recently suggested they won\u2019t be pursing the waiver in the case of Turkey, which has defied repeated calls by the administration not to purchase the S-400 system.\n\nMr. Jaishankar on Monday downplayed the notion that CAATSA could be used against New Delhi.\n\nIndia has a history of purchasing weapons from Russia dating back to the Cold War. While U.S.-India relations have expanded dramatically since the Soviet Union\u2019s 1991 collapse, New Delhi has continued to buy such high-end Russian gear as the MiG-29 fighter jet.\n\nMr. Jaishankar suggested it would unfair to pressure New Delhi now not to proceed with the S-400. He also went to significant lengths Monday to emphasize India\u2019s growing military ties with the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe had until 15 years ago, virtually no defense relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom 1965 to 2005, 40 years, we bought nothing from the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut since then India has bought an expanding range of U.S.-made systems, including C-17 and C-130 aircraft, Chinook and Apache helicopters, and American artillery and Navy ships. \u201cMore than that,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said, \u201csome of the most serious military exercises in the world are [now] done between us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
