Townsend saw no reason to take any risks with his health as replaced his talisman midway through the second half with his place in the travelling party an absolute certainty.\n\nScotland were looking for only their fourth away win in their last 12 Tests but there was almost a 53,000 sell-out crowd at the Dinamo Arena willing the hosts to hand Townsend\u2019s team another bloody nose on the road.\n\nWith the Scots the first Tier One nation to ever visit the Caucasus, Georgia were keen to make an impression.\n\nBut their over-eagerness at the breakdown gave Scotland a string of early penalties.\n\nSkipper Greig Laidlaw punished their in-discipline \u2013 some of it astounding in its stupidity \u2013 by slotting over two simple penalties straight in front of the posts inside the opening 11 minutes.\n\nRussell made his first major contribution three minutes later as he found a gap and drove through. Before Georgia knew what was happening, support had arrived on the playmaker\u2019s shoulder and the ball was quickly fed through the hands of Matt Fagerson, Laidlaw and finally Toolis, with the big lock given the luxury of time to jog in and dot down.\n\nFour minutes later and Russell was instigating things again. His clever kick set Graham scampering forward as the Georgian lines were punctured again.\n\nAs the Lelos scrambled for cover, Scotland kept their composure as Russell pulled the ball back to Hutchinson, with his dancing feet giving his marker the slip as he cantered in for the second touchdown.\n\nSoso Matiashvili and Laidlaw traded penalties just before the break but Scotland extended their lead in the 47th minute with Russell at the centre of it again.\n\nHe took the ball to the line before dropping it back for Blair Kinghorn. Hutchinson then arrived at the perfect moment to speed through for his second.\n\nBut Georgia at last gave the home support what they had come to see as Asieshvili barged over in the 57th minute.\n\nJust as it looked like their reliance on blunt force would be foiled after a series of drives were repelled by the Scots, the prop finally got the momentum he needed to steam past John Barclay and Jamie Ritchie on the line.\n\nBut there was still time for Russell to make one last magical contribution before he made way for Adam Hastings as he set up Scotland\u2019s fourth try with 18 minutes left.\n\nSubstitute Josh Strauss smashed over the gain-line to get Scotland back on the front foot and Russell\u2019s grubber kick laid the ball on a plate for Graham to dive on top once it had crossed the whitewash.\n\nLock Cummings then underlined his stake for a World Cup place when he barged through again late on to round off a resounding win.\n\nPA", "description": "Finn Russell stole the limelight as Scotland\u00a0put on a show in their final Rugby World Cup audition with a 44-10 thrashing of Georgia\u00a0in Tbilisi.
