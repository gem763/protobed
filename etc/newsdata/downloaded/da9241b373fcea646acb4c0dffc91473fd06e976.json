Brouillette has been filling in for Perry at Cabinet meetings for the past few months, one source added. Many of Perry\u2019s former DOE staff members \u2014 including chief of staff Brian McCormack and special assistant Luke Wallwork \u2014 have all left DOE in recent weeks, a source said.\n\nTrump said Perry had actually indicated to him earlier this year that he planned to leave.\n\n\u201cRick and I have been talking for six months,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIn fact, I thought he might go a bit sooner. But he\u2019s got some very big plans. He\u2019s going to be very successful. We have his successor, we\u2019ll announce it pretty soon.\u201d\n\nPerry's frequent trips to Eastern Europe as pitchman for U.S. energy exports were a subject of subpoenas that House Democrats served to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani earlier this month. That subpoena includes a demand for documents and other communications involving Perry and the former New York City mayor connected to Ukraine. A second subpoena seeks details of conversations between acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Perry, as well as records from other current or former DOE officials.\n\nPerry has repeatedly said that he never talked to Ukraine officials about the Bidens. But Mulvaney earlier Thursday told reporters at the White House that the administration had in fact expected a quid pro quo with the Ukraine government regarding the military aid and an investigation into the Bidens. Mulvaney later said the media has \u201cmisconstrued\u201d his remarks.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d2/42/5e9ef42c48629e94fc05669746e3/191017-rick-perry-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
