There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids, and share certain things with you.\u201d\n\nThe blunt remarks were essentially an expanded version of a saying Obama often employed while in office -- don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The comments Tuesday show the ex-president embracing the image of a practical elder statesman at a time when his party is drifting ever-leftward -- essentially urging young party activists to reconsider a culture of calling out those who run afoul of their worldview, whether in the language they use or the policies they espouse.\n\nObama specifically noted that a trend he sees on college campuses could do more harm than good, suggesting young people are focusing more on casting judgment on others than advancing positive change.\n\n\u201cOne danger I see among young people, particularly on college campuses,\u201d he continued, \u201cI do get a sense sometimes now among certain young people -- and this is accelerated by social media \u2013 there is this sense sometimes of the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people, and that\u2019s enough. Like, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or use the wrong verb, then I can feel pretty good about myself, \u2018cause man did you see how woke I was? I called you out.'\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far. That\u2019s easy to do.\u201d\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama also spoke at the event, discussing racism and discrimination.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make people not afraid of black people,\u201d she said, according to The Hill. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t explain what\u2019s happening in your head.\n\n\u201cBut maybe if I show up every day as a human, a good human, doing wonderful things, loving my family, loving our kids, taking care of things that I care about \u2014 maybe, just maybe that work will pick away at the scabs of our discrimination. Maybe that will slowly unravel it.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Dom Calicchio contributed to this report.", "description": "Former President Barack Obama\u00a0took aim Tuesday at\u00a0\u201cwoke\u201d virtue signaling and cancel culture, telling an audience in Chicago that activists \u201cshould get over\u201d their obsession with ideological purity tests.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/ContentBroker_contentid-561f78ed6d874b6a9c07e58b6bac2e07.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
