Jurors also could have recommended life in prison with no possibility of parole.\n\nHis attorney Daniel Nardoni said outside court that he was angered and disappointed by the decision.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t kill people that are mentally ill,\u201d Nardoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of humanity. There\u2019s a different kind of punishment for the mentally ill. It\u2019s called life without parole.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys and a psychologist said in court that Gargiulo has dissociative personality disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder.\n\nProsecutors, who did not talk to reporters after the hearing, called Gargiulo \u201cThe Boy Next Door Killer\u201d because he lived near all the victims.\n\nHe also was convicted of the 2005 murder of 32-year-old Maria Bruno and the 2008 attempted murder of Michelle Murphy, who testified during the trial\u2019s penalty phase that she lived in fear for years after the attack.\n\nMurphy fought when she was attacked in bed in her Santa Monica apartment. Authorities said Gargiulo cut himself and left a trail of blood that allowed prosecutors to tie him to the other cases, including a 1997 killing in Illinois for which he is still awaiting trial.\n\nMurphy was also a key witness during the first phase of the trial.\n\n\u201cIn the days, weeks and months after it happened, I barely even slept,\u201d Murphy testified. \u201cI feared the nighttime and going to bed. I still slept with the lights on for a long time.\u201d\n\nGargiulo\u2019s attorneys contended that other men committed the murders of Bruno and Ellerin. They conceded their client had attacked Murphy but said he was in a \u201cfugue state\u201d because of his personality disorder and did not know where he was at the time.\n\nAll three women were attacked in their Southern California homes when Gargiulo lived nearby and watched his victims. Ellerin become an acquaintance before the attacks.\n\nEllerin\u2019s mother and other victims\u2019 family members also testified during the penalty phase.\n\nWhen she learned about the death of her daughter, Cynthia Ellerin said, \u201cI fell to my knees on the floor and started crawling around the bedroom on my hands and knees like an animal, screaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ache for her,\u201d Cynthia Ellerin said. \u201cI ache to hold her. I ache to hear her voice, to hug her. But that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nGargiulo\u2019s 16-year-old son also took the stand, asking jurors for mercy and telling them he needs a father who is alive.\n\nAfter the jury\u2019s decision was read, Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler ordered Gargiulo to return for formal sentencing on Feb. 28, when he will also consider motions for a new trial or a reduced sentence.\n\nCalifornia has not executed anyone since 2006, and Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this year halted executions for as long as he is in office.\n\nCourts have been proceeding on the assumption that executions may one day resume.\n\nThe case received extra attention because of the connection of Kutcher, who was a 23-year-old rising star on \u201cThat \u201870s Show\u201d when Ellerin was killed.\n\nHe testified in May that he feared he might become a suspect after going to Ellerin\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cI remember the next day after I heard about what happened, I went to the detectives and said, \u2018My fingerprints are on the door,\u2019\u201d Kutcher testified. \u201cI was freaking out.\u201d\n\nThe defense asserted that Ellerin was killed by another man who was romantically linked to her and was jealous that she was about to go on a date with the actor.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Los Angeles jury recommended the death penalty Friday for a man dubbed \"The Boy Next Door Killer\" after he was found guilty of two murders and an attempted murder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dalton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/serial_killing_trial_84447_c0-193-3312-2125_s1200x700.jpg?e1e1e074fd7bf82d6bea672fd140a5a40acde4d1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
