According to the UN more than half of global population growth between now and 2050 will happen across the continent.\n\nKenya is a big part of this equation: the country now has nearly 50 million people, and its population is predicted to about double by 2050. And, unlike many of its global counterparts whose populations are rapidly ageing, Kenya\u2019s population is one of the youngest. Its rapidly growing youth demographic isn\u2019t its only defining feature, however: with 44 recognised tribes, Kenya is also among the most ethnically diverse countries on Earth.\n\nAlthough many numbers tell Kenya\u2019s population story, its shifting demographics may be far deeper and more dynamic than the purely quantitative statistics that define them.\n\nNairobi-based photographer Tobin Jones, 32, set out to create a vibrant, nuanced representation of Kenya \u00ad\u2013 his 100-image \u201cphotographic infographic\u201d called \u2018Demographica\u2019 \u2013 which aims to put faces and stories to population statistics. Born in Botswana and raised in Malawi and Kenya, Jones has had a front-row seat for Kenya\u2019s massive population changes over the last three decades.", "description": "Can 100 images tell the stories of 50 million people?
