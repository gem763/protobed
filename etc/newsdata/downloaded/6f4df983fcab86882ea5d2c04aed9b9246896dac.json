The doors open and more passengers press in before \u2013 inch by inch \u2013 the hydraulic doors groan shut, slowly shunting the new arrivals inside.\n\n\u201cAll the buses are coming like this\u201d, said Roberto L\u00f3pez, 66, on his way \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 to buy biscuits in the city centre.\n\nBus services throughout Cuba have been slashed in recent weeks as the island grapples with acute petrol shortages caused by US sanctions which target companies and oil tankers transporting Venezuelan petroleum to the island.\n\nCuba\u2019s President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel has said the island is currently operating with 62% of the petrol it needs, and announced emergency measures to \u201cdisrupt the plans of imperialism\u201d. Across the island, production has been cut and stopgaps found, so that fuel can be prioritized for hospitals, schools and food distribution.\n\nCuba forced into rationing as US sanctions and Venezuela crisis bite Read more\n\nOxen have replaced tractors in sugarcane fields; some bakeries are using firewood to power their ovens. Transport inspectors have been deployed to ensure that anyone driving a vehicle which belongs to a ministry or state enterprise gives fellow citizens a lift.\n\nAt the Alamar textile factory \u2013 and in offices and factories throughout the island \u2013 all machines and lights are switched off between 11am and 1pm. Taking her extended lunch break, Aimee Machu, 52, said the US wants to stem the flow of oil to \u201cextinguish the flame of communism\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt they cut the power in my house it\u2019ll be torture,\u201d she laughed, adding with mettle: \u201cBut if we have to go through power cuts again, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Cuban,\u201d her colleague Rita Castro, 60, chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019re used to this!\u201d\n\nDespite its myriad problems, the Cuban economy has proved resilient when times get tough, according to Pavel Vidal, a former economist at the Cuban Central Bank who now teaches at the Javeriana Cali University in Colombia.\n\n\u201cIn normal conditions, Cuba\u2019s centrally planned economy impedes economic growth, progress and innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in times of crisis, having a plan to assign resources where they are needed is an advantage.\u201d\n\nThe collapse of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry \u2013 the result of years of mismanagement, incompetence and, more recently, US sanctions \u2013 has seen its oil shipments to Cuba slump, from more than 90,000 barrels a day four years ago to about 40,000 today.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alberto Font and Iris Ortiz watch a local TV news recording of a speech by Cuba\u2019s President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel in Havana on Thursday.

The US has progressively ratcheted up sanctions against Venezuelan oil and those buying or transporting it since January, culminating in Cuba\u2019s oil import-export company also being placed under sanctions in July.\n\nThe three biggest sectors of the island\u2019s economy have all been targeted. The state department is working to delegitimise the island\u2019s main export: the leasing of doctors to other developing countries. In June, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Cuba\u2019s medical cooperation programmes \u2013 to which doctors sign up voluntarily \u2013 amount to \u201chuman trafficking\u201d.\n\nIn June US cruise ships were banned from docking at the island \u2013 a major blow to tourism \u2013 while in September the cap on remittances people in the US can send to the island was sharply cut back.\n\nThe Cuban government insists the situation is \u201ctemporary\u201d and has said there will be no return to anything resembling the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d, the official term for the deep economic crisis Cuba went through after the fall of the Soviet Union, when the average adult lost more than 5kg and getting through the day without electricity was so common that Cubans talked not so much of \u201cpower cuts\u201d (apagones) but of \u201cpower ons\u201d (alumbrones).\n\nAfter seeing her country\u2019s economy improve rapidly after the normalisation of US-Cuban relations announced in 2014, Maite Rizo, 26, has watched the deterioration of relations between the two countries with alarm.\n\n\u201cI feel confused, even scared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a period of bonanza to a situation where everything\u2019s gone backwards very quickly. From here on, we don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d\n\nThroughout the capital, meanwhile, commuters get by as best they can.\n\nBrazil's ban on Cuban cigars leaves leftwingers fuming Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a battle to get to work,\u201d said Nuerca S\u00e1nchez, 45, a rumba teacher, while a dozen commuters jostled for spare seats in a car on its way to a state cigar factory. She sees the emergency transport measures as common sense, and is touched when the odd private car stops voluntarily to give people lifts.\n\n\u201cHelping each other isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having heart.\u201d\n\nUnder the blazing sun, others take the long view.\n\nPedro Leocadeo, 64, who is retired, concedes that he might wait hours for a place on a bus. Shimmering in beads of sweat, he sees the sanctions on tankers in the broad sweep of New World history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this ever since Hatuey,\u201d he said, invoking the Ta\u00edno warrior who in 1511 fled from the island of Hispaniola to Cuba to warn the natives of unscrupulous aggressors from foreign lands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like this today; tomorrow things might get better \u2013 the following day things might get worse again,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it all depends on the Yankees.\u201d", "description": "As Washington punishes Cuba for supporting Venezuela, Cubans are replacing tractors with oxen and oil with firewood", "authors": ["Ed Augustin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58090495ac4676a122eb35356683c55b7ebff0d6/0_194_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc8661b48d89fc6755131235b6fa5392", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
