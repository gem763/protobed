Robredo is already halfway through her six-year term.\n\nThe court instead decided to make public the result of the recount covering three provinces that will serve as basis for any further action on Marcos\u2019 challenge. It also asked the two camps to comment on Marcos\u2019 plea to nullify votes in three other provinces due to supposed irregularities in the 2016 elections.\n\n\u201cThe proper vice president -- myself -- is being robbed of years of service,\u201d Marcos said in a televised interview. President Rodrigo Duterte, who has faced questions on his health, has repeatedly said Marcos is his preferred successor if he had to leave office before his single term expires in 2022.\n\nRobredo, leader of the opposition party, said she welcomes the court decision, as she urged the court to already junk Marcos\u2019 protest. \u201cThe mere fact that this has been dragging on for so long only provides Marcos a platform for his lies,\u201d she said in a separate televised briefing.\n\n(Updates with comments from Marcos and Robredo from fourth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Andreo Calonzo in Manila at acalonzo1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Cecilia Yap at cyap19@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Philippines\u2019 top court on Tuesday decided to release the initial results of the vice-presidential vote recount, which the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 son said will delay his chance to assume the post.Former Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said he is \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the court\u2019s decision", "authors": ["Andreo Calonzo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p1_WKd2NdEaP93stdqqgLA--~B/aD0xMzMxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/531e9d84e840296513a039519d8c719b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
