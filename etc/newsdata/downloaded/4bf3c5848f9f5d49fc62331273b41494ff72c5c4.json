Sufficient sleep was defined as nine hours or more on an average weeknight.\n\nThe researchers also asked the parents and caregivers about five \"individual flourishing markers,\" which are signs that the child is engaged in and flourishing in school. These signs include showing interest and curiosity in learning new things; caring about doing well in school; doing required homework; working to finish tasks already started; and staying calm and in control when faced with a challenge.\n\n\n\nAfter taking into account potentially influencing factors such as age, time spent in front of a screen, playing video games and other electronic devices and mental health conditions, the findings suggested that only 48 percent of children in the United States are getting nine hours of sleep most weeknights.\n\nIn addition, getting sufficient sleep was positively linked with several individual flourishing markers. Children who got nine hours or more shut-eye most weeknights were 44 percent more likely to show interest and curiosity in learning new things, 33 percent more likely to do their homework, 28 percent more likely to care about doing well in school, and 14 percent more likely to finish tasks, compared with children who did not get sufficient sleep.\n\nPrevious research has found that the more flourishing markers children have, the more likely they are to exhibit healthy behaviors and fewer risky behaviors.\n\nThe researchers also found that not getting enough sleep was linked with children living in poorer families, having mental health conditions, more digital media usage and an increased number of adverse childhood experiences.\n\nDr. Tsao says that the findings reinforce the importance of helping children get the recommended amount of sleep for their age, by cutting down digital media usage and promoting a bedtime routine.\n\n\"Chronic sleep loss is a serious public health problem among children,\" said Dr. Tsao. \"Insufficient sleep among adolescents, for example, is associated with physical and mental health consequences including increased risk of depression and obesity and negative effects on mood, attention and academic performance.\"\n\n\"Interventions like these may help children demonstrate more measures of childhood flourishing, enhance their development and give them brighter futures,\" she said.\n\nAn abstract of the study will be presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2019 National Conference & Exhibition in New Orleans on Saturday, October 26.", "description": "New research has found that only 48 percent of US school children are getting a sufficient amount of sleep each night, and those who do are more likely to show signs of flourishing in school.
