Kirk lowered his first-quarter fiscal 2020 sales estimate to C$98 million from a previous C$117 million, below the C$105 million consensus. \"We believe profitability for cultivators will generally get worse before getting better,\" said the note. \"Pricing is already decreasing and supply availability will continue to grow/improve.\" Aurora shares were up 1.9% in premarket trade, but have fallen 26% in 2019, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF has fallen 25% and the S&P 500 SPX, +1.09% has gained 18%.", "description": "MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk cut his stock price target on Aurora Cannabis Inc. on Monday to C$3.50 ($2.65) from C$5.00, and said there is still some...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
