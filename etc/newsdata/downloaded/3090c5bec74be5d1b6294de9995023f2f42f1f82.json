Anyone with a scintilla of historical knowledge knows that is not a good idea.\u201d\n\nProfessor Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said that a customs compromise could be based around a scaled-down version of Theresa May\u2019s 2018 \u201cnew customs partnership\u201d plan.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the UK could collect tariffs on behalf of the EU on goods passing between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, with businesses in the North entitled to rebates if the UK tariff is lower.\n\nBut Brussels gave short shrift to the idea when it was put forward by Mr Johnson\u2019s predecessor and could be expected to take a similar line if he put forward his own variant, said Prof Menon.\n\n\u201cThe alternative might be allowing Northern Ireland in some way to remain in the EU customs union, which the DUP regards as anathema,\u201d said Prof Menon. \u201cJohnson has made keeping the UK in a single customs territory a central part of his definition of sovereignty, so it\u2019s difficult to see how he rows back on that.\u201d\n\nMr Varadkar appeared to signal on Thursday that Dublin may be ready to shift from its position that the North must remain in the EU customs union.\n\nAsked if this was still a red line, he replied: \u201cIt remains our position that there cannot be a hard border between North and South. And we must continue to have a situation whereby the all-island economy can continue to deepen and function well.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cpathway\u201d to a Brexit deal sighted by Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar in The Wirral on Thursday is thought to involve concessions from both sides on the issues of customs and Northern Irish consent for new arrangements.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith last night indicated that a compromise", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rh6GgBUwfZ7DCoAR7qH6Tg--~B/aD0zODE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b02cb9a982b98807abfb524f635c4d9d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
