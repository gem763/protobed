LYFT -1.80%\n\nNew York-based fitness company Peloton is set this week to join a string of rapidly growing tech companies trying to go public at multibillion-dollar valuations, even though it is still spilling red ink.\n\nWhile they were private, these companies could easily paint rosy pictures of their finances. But going public means they have to report numbers based on standard accounting rules, which often reveal losses, sometimes huge ones.\n\nPeloton said in May 2018 it was bucking this money-losing trend. \u201cWe are profitable,\u201d John Foley, the company\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said during a CNBC interview.\n\nThe audited financial statements unveiled ahead of Peloton\u2019s initial public offering tell a different story. Peloton lost $196 million in the year through June, has been running at a loss since its 2012 formation\u2014including when Mr. Foley said it was profitable\u2014and expects to continue to incur net losses \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d according to its regulatory filing.\n\nThe only measure on which Peloton is making money is gross profit, which is revenue less the cost of its exercise bikes and other products. Add in the costs of running its business and the profit disappears.\n\nLynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant, said profits mean one thing and other definitions are misleading. \u201cWhen people say that they\u2019re profitable, they\u2019re talking about the bottom line,\u201d he said.\n\nA Peloton spokeswoman declined to comment, as the company is in a quiet period ahead of going public.\n\nPeloton is far from the only unicorn\u2014privately held startups valued at more than $1 billion\u2014that has tried to polish its financial image. We Co. delayed its offering last week amid investor skepticism about its valuation, finances and governance.\n\nIn a 2014 investor presentation, We put up a slide with the headline \u201cProven, profitable business model.\u201d The slide went on to state that \u201cWeWork locations operate\u2026with average margins greater than 40%.\u201d\n\nThis optimism was repeated in stories about the company. \u201cBy February 2010, just one month after launch, WeWork turned its first profit and has never stopped,\u201d Forbes reported the same year. In 2016, The Real Deal, a real-estate industry publication, said that \u201cunlike many other real estate startups\u2026WeWork has been profitable for years.\u201d\n\nStuart Elliott, editor in chief of The Real Deal, said the 2016 article was based on leaked WeWork documents. A Forbes spokeswoman said \u201cthe information in the story was provided by [We CEO] Adam Neumann directly.\u201d\n\nWe reported a net loss of more than $904 million for the six months through June and said in a filing for its IPO that it \u201cmay be unable to achieve profitability at a company level\u2026for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think is the best way to measure a company\u2019s valuation? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe filing included a chart of contribution margin that showed a positive $340 million in the first half of the year, though the number excludes almost $200 million in lease costs and more than $1.5 billion of other charges covering everything from \u201cpre-opening location expenses\u201d\u2014refurbishing buildings before renting them out\u2014to new market development.\n\nA spokeswoman for We declined to comment as the company is in a quiet period ahead of its IPO. We has said contribution margin allows investors to \u201canalyze the core operating performance of our locations.\u201d\n\nScott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University, said the challenges facing We\u2019s IPO show the importance of conventional financial statements.\n\nRapidly growing companies say metrics that exclude the costs of expanding their businesses, such as advertising to attract new customers, are a good gauge of their long-term prospects, rather than conventional metrics that require them to account for upfront costs.\n\nCompanies that claimed profitability while they were private sometimes persist after their IPOs. Lyft, which went public in March, reported a $1.8 billion net loss for the first half of the year, as well as record revenues.\n\nBut Brian Roberts, the chief financial officer, cited a sharp jump in Lyft\u2019s \u201ccontribution\u201d in a call with investors last month. Contribution, the company says, is a measure of gross profit that strips out some charges from the cost of sales. A Lyft spokeswoman said the company believes it has a clear path to profitability. She added that the metrics Lyft offers investors \u201care useful for them to understand the ongoing success of our product, platform and operations.\u201d\n\nMr. Galloway, the New York University professor, questioned whether there was a role for the SEC to step in more aggressively when companies \u201cstart trying to contaminate traditional accounting terms.\u201d\n\nThe regulator polices disclosures by public companies, which are barred from giving nonstandard metrics more prominence than their traditional accounting equivalents. The SEC last year filed a cease-and-desist order against ADT Inc., a Boca Raton, Fla.-based security business, for trumpeting its \u201cadjusted Ebitda\u201d in two earnings releases without also highlighting a higher net loss. A spokeswoman for ADT, which paid $100,000 to settle the allegations without admitting liability, declined to comment.\n\nThe SEC also can take action against private companies for statements that mislead investors. It uses this power sparingly, in part because investors in those companies tend to be big and sophisticated, lawyers say.\n\nJames Cox, a law professor at Duke University, said it is \u201cunusual for the SEC to pursue private companies for misrepresenting their finances, unless there\u2019s immediate trading in the securities or plans to raise money from small investors.\u201d\n\nAn SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n\u2014Maureen Farrell contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jean Eaglesham at jean.eaglesham@wsj.com", "description": "Investors are starting to demand profits, or at least profits in the near future, from richly valued tech companies when they go public.
