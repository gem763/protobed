Put your whole damn fingers in their salads,\u201d tweeted Thomas in 2018. \u201cTake their apps and distribute them to the other diners. Bring boxes and take their food home with you on the way out. They don\u2019t deserve your civility.\u201d\n\nThomas is now leading the committee that addresses \u201ccases involving the dismissal or termination of tenured faculty, the non-renewal of a contract for a non-tenured faculty member when there is a substantial claim that such action violates academic freedom or equal employment rights, or the dismissal of a non-tenured faculty member prior to the expiration of a term appointment,\u201d according to the Ole Miss website.\n\nIn May, Thomas\u2019 own tenure was called into question \u2014 not for his 2018 calls to end civility and contaminate GOP senators\u2019 meals \u2014 but for the professor\u2019s more recent controversial comments, in which he talked about using conservative professors at Ole Miss in a \u201cblood sacrifice.\u201d\n\nThe truth is there used to be three or four conservative professors at UM.

The professor announced his new role in a tweet last month, in which he referred to himself as \u201cCaptain Twitter Fingers.\u201d\n\nToday I \u2013 Captain Twitter Fingers \u2013 was elected chair of the Chancellor's Standing Committee on Academic Freedom and Faculty Responsibility \u2014 JT \ud83c\udf39 (@Insurgent_Prof) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cToday I \u2014 Captain Twitter Fingers \u2014 was elected chair of the Chancellor\u2019s Standing Committee on Academic Freedom and Faculty Responsibility,\u201d said Thomas in a September 17 tweet, which included a Twitter poll allowing users to vote for either \u201cJoke\u2019s on me\u201d or \u201cJoke\u2019s on them.\u201d\n\nAccording to the final results of the Twitter poll, the joke\u2019s on Ole Miss.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) Professor James Thomas \u2014 who last year said that leftists should put their \"whole damn fingers\" in Republican senators' meals, because they \"don\u2019t deserve civility\" \u2014 has been elected the chair of the Chancellor's Committee on \"Academic Freedom and Faculty Responsibility.\"", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/Ole-Miss-Prof-James-Thomas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
