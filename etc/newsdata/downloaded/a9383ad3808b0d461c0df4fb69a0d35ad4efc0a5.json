Many of the proposed reforms draw on existing proposals in other documents including the National Development Plan.\n\nThe document states that a combination of low growth and rising unemployment means that South Africa\u2019s economic trajectory is unsustainable.\n\n\"The bulk of the interventions are realistically executable in the medium term, and include reforms in the telecommunications, agriculture, services, and transport industries. Short-term interventions are important as they lay a foundation for other reforms, while long-term interventions address competitiveness,\" the report said.\n\nIt deals with six main themes:\n\nModernizing network industries to promote competitiveness and inclusive growth;\n\nLowering barriers to entry and addressing distorted patterns of ownership through increased competition and small business growth;\n\nPrioritizing labour-intensive growth: agriculture and services;\n\nImplementing focused and flexible industrial and trade policy to promote competitiveness and facilitate long-run growth;\n\nPromoting export competitiveness and harnessing regional growth opportunities;\n\nQuantifying the impact of proposed growth reforms.\n\nMboweni has called on members of the public to submit comments on the document by September 15.", "description": "'This paper is a detailed examination of the structural reforms that can reverse the downward trend in South Africa\u2019s growth potential and competitiveness,' says National Treasury.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8787/99f0a2eccd9649f4a2b610bb814c67c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
