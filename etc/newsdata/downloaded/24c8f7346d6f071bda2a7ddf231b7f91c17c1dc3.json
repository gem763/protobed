The white house and president trump is facing new questions over that false hurricane forecast he sent to his Twitter followers. In the oval office yesterday he tried to defend the tweet with an official map that had been falsified with I a handwritten mark. Our senior white house correspondent Cecilia Vega has the story. Good morning, Cecilia. Reporter: Good morning to you. The president is not letting this one go. He is still insisting that Alabama was in Dorian's danger zone even though the national weather service publicly contradicted him on that. Call it mapgate 2019, the question this morning, did president trump show a doctored map hoping to prove he was right when he warned hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama? The president displaying that map in the oval office. That was the original chart and you see it was going to hit not only Florida but Georgia, it was going toward the gulf. That was what we -- what was originally projected. And it took a right turn. Reporter: The blacks line projecting it would move from Florida to Alabama appears to be drawn on by a marker. Here's the original issued last Thursday. Alabama in the clear. President trump has repeated Liriano insisted Alabama was in Dorian's path? Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that. Reporter: The national weather service even forced to correct him saying Alabama will not see any impacts from Dorian. But he is still not backing down. I know that Alabama was in the original forecast but Alabama was hit very hard and was going to be hit very hart along with Georgia. Reporter: Now FEMA and noaa referring all questions about the seemingly doctored map back to the white house where president trump said he knew nothing about it. And that map that you showed us today, it looked almost like had it a sharpie. I don't know. Reporter: The president digging in releasing another map showing Dorian projected to hit this one from a regional water agency with the warning if anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product. So it's not just the president digging in this morning, his aides here at the white house are following his lead as well. One spokesman tweeting watch them go ballistic would be hilarious if it weren't so sad. When all else fails blame the media. That is what we have seen.
