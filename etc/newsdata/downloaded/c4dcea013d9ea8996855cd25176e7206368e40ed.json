While he was president our economy was strong and America was largely at peace, and was also liked and respected throughout the world.\n\nBILL MAHER URGES CLINTONS TO SKIP DEMS' 2020 CONVENTION: 'THEY'VE GOT TO GO AWAY\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton, she\u2019s a former secretary of state, senator and first lady. She\u2019s also the first woman nominated by a major party to run for president \u2013 and she received nearly 3 million more popular votes than Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nHillary Clinton is a citizen with First Amendment right to express her opinions just like the rest of us. She\u2019s allowed to state her views on social media sites like Twitter, in media interviews and anywhere else she likes. She\u2019s also allowed to make a living, whether it\u2019s by writing books or by giving speeches.\n\nAnd admit it, when Hillary Clinton speaks, people listen \u2013 whether to praise her or mock her. And perhaps one reason she won\u2019t go away is that so many people like to bring her name up and continue to keep her relevant.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN END 2020 CAMPAIGN SPECULATION: BRAZILE\n\nJust recently Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich., tweeted about Hillary Clinton being a \u201cDonald Trump asset\u201d after Clinton implied that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, was a Russian asset. Gabbard is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn addition, some of Hillary Clinton\u2019s former Senate Democratic colleagues are seeming to signal politely that they would prefer she doesn\u2019t run for president again in 2020 \u2013 despite Clinton herself saying she\u2019s not running and showing no indication of doing so.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said that Clinton has \u201cdone a great service to our country and public service, and I supported her wholeheartedly, but I believe it\u2019s time for another nominee.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump \u2013 now the subject of a House impeachment investigation and accused of many instances of wrongful behavior \u2013 also keeps Hillary Clinton in the news, almost always calling her \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the [presidential] race to try and steal it away from her Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Trump recently said, referring to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts who is now seeking her party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nClinton responded to Trump (quite tongue in cheek, in my opinion): \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job. \u201c\n\nAnother reason Clinton shouldn\u2019t go away is that she is still liked by millions of Americans.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Clinton received almost 65.9 million popular votes, ahead of the almost 63 million votes Trump received. Clinton voters haven\u2019t just disappeared. I\u2019m sure most of them haven\u2019t decided to now hate the woman they once wanted to lead our nation.\n\nAlso, although many on both the left and the right believe Clinton is a detriment to Democrats, that\u2019s not true. She\u2019s a proven fundraising powerhouse for the party.\n\nIn one week Hillary Clinton raised $1.5 million for Act Blue, an online fundraising platform for Democrats. Half of that money came through Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd in 2016, Clinton raised $143 million in just one month \u2013 not just for her campaign, but for other Democratic campaigns as well.\n\nWhen Hillary and her daughter Chelsea recently appeared on Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d the program saw a record high in ratings. More than 3.7 million people tuned in.\n\nClinton\u2019s latest book, which she co-wrote with Chelsea, is called \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women\u201d and is a bestseller, as was her post-election book \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bottom line is that as much as some Democrats and Republicans may tell Hillary Clinton to go away, both Democrats and Republicans keep injecting her name into the political conversation.\n\nAnd whether you love her or hate her, millions buy her books, show up to her speaking gigs, write checks to benefit Democratic political campaigns, or tune in to watch her on television.\n\nHillary and Bill Clinton aren\u2019t going anywhere. Shame on Democrats who once revered them both for asking them to now disappear from public life.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "description": "Last week, Bill Maher, host of \u201cReal Time\u201d on HBO, told his audience: \u201cThe Clintons, they\u2019ve got to go away.\u201d Well, as a fellow liberal, I strongly disagree.", "authors": ["Leslie Marshall", "Leslie Marshall Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In", "Providing Analysis On Both Political", "Social Issues A Liberal Point Of View.
