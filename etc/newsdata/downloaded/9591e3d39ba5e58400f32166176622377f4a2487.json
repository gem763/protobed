It was part of his personal collection before becoming part of the museum that bears his name.\n\nThe museum's executive director and chief curator, Susan D Friedlander, said that the museum was \"very upset\" to learn the painting's history. The museum waived all rights to the painting.\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nYou might also be interested in...", "description": "The artwork, seized in Germany in 1933, will be returned to the original Jewish owners by the FBI.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/910F/production/_109353173_gari_melchers_winter_alamy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
