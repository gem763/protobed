It was offensive, and we apologize. https://t.co/gbUdweKbDg \u2014 New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) September 15, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the revelations have prompted renewed backlash against Kavanaugh, whose bitter confirmation hearings last year centered on allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford while both were in high school.\n\nNow, several of the 2020 presidential candidates including Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) are calling for further investigations into Kavanaugh or even impeaching him.\n\nThe Times story includes a new account of Kavanaugh\u2019s alleged misconduct from his Yale classmate Max Stier. Stier said that while attending a party as a freshman, he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down and friends shoving Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into a female student\u2019s hand.\n\nStier told Pogrebin and Kelly that he reported it to the FBI and to senators, but that it went uninvestigated by the feds.\n\nThe report also notes that the FBI declined to follow up with anyone on a list of 25 witnesses Ramirez provided to corroborate her story. Kavanaugh has denied the stories of both Ramirez and Ford, and he declined to answer the Times\u2019 questions about Stier\u2019s allegation.", "description": "The newspaper deleted a tweet saying an alleged act of sexual misconduct by the future Supreme Court justice \"may seem like harmless fun.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7e975d3b00002b88d42ea3.jpeg?cache=gfowyytdsh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
