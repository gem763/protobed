However, the indicator of expectations for future sales dropped one point to 70. The gauge of sentiment regarding buyer traffic remained even at 50.\n\nRegionally, home-builder sentiment improved markedly in the Northeast, South and West and remained even in the Midwest.\n\nBig picture: The NAHB\u2019s index can be an indicator of future home-building activity. Put simply: Builders who are confident in the health of the real-estate market are more inclined to start construction of new homes. This can have ripple effects throughout the rest of the economy, thanks to a boost in employment.\n\nThe real-estate market\u2019s struggles of late have largely been tied to affordability, and depressed home-building activity is a major contributor to those hurdles. There are very few homes up for sale relative to long-term historical averages, and building activity has yet to fully rebound from the last recession.\n\n\u201cThe housing story remains primarily one of imbalance between demand and supply,\u201d Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae\u2019s FNMA, -1.25% chief economist, said in a research note Tuesday. This imbalance has driven home prices higher, forcing many would-be buyers to the sidelines.\n\nLow mortgage rates have helped the situation some, but increased building activity at the affordable end of the market could help even more. \u201cRefreshingly, in the absence of existing stock, home builders appear to be increasingly focused on entry-level homes, as the median square footage of new single-family construction fell 4.3% in the second quarter,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cBuilders saw a continuation of the improvement in business from late 2018, but metrics softened slightly from a very strong July, and pricing power appears to have weakened,\u201d BTIG Research homebuilding analyst Carl Reichardt, Jr. and REIT REIT, +1.01% analyst Ryan Gilbert wrote in a research note based on a survey of small- and medium-sized home builders released Monday.\n\nAs the market shifts into a lower gear as summer draws to a close, home builders\u2019 pricing has softened as expected. But the BTIG analysts noted that some builders see the market\u2019s \u201crecent strength as a \u2018flash in the pan\u2019 caused by the sudden rate drop.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: Shares of publicly-traded home builders are up significantly in 2019 as the housing market\u2019s outlook has grown rosier throughout the year.\n\nShares of LGI Homes Inc. LGIH, +1.72% have increased more than 78% for the year to date, while shares of D.R. Horton Inc. DHI, +1.35% are up 42%. Comparatively, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% is up by nearly 16% over that same period, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.26% is up almost 20%.", "description": "The median square footage of new single-family construction fell 4.3% in the second quarter.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK706_builde_ZG_20180611151031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
