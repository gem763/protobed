He also had a long stint at lower-level Georgetown and stops at Akron and UConn before he parlayed a job as the offensive coordinator at Penn State into the Mississippi State gig.\n\nWhile Moorhead was taking Fordham to three straight FCS playoffs, Klieman was winning four national championships in five years as the head coach at North Dakota State.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t say anything disparaging about the division formerly known as I-AA.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018took a similar path,\u2019\u201d Moorhead said of Klieman, \u201cbut he really did a great job at the FCS level. He has the third-highest winning percentage among all active NCAA head coaches and has won 23 straight games, so that\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nNot that what Moorhead has done in Starkville is unimpressive.\n\nHe went 8-5 in his first season on the sideline, including a 31-10 rout at Kansas State in then-coach Bill Snyder\u2019s last season with the Wildcats. The Bulldogs wound up reaching the Outback Bowl, and have kept the momentum going with a pair of wins to start this season.\n\n\u201cKansas State had a great opportunity early on,\u201d Klieman said of last year\u2019s game in Manhattan, \u201cbut just wasn\u2019t able to capitalize on some things. It\u2019s a game that we\u2019re watching, but systematically some of the things have changed. So, we aren\u2019t putting all of our emphasis into that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at more of these first couple games,\u201d Klieman added. \u201cWith what they are doing, obviously, they are looking at more our first two games rather than last year as well.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats trounced Nicholls and Bowling Green to start the season, but this will be their first big test of Klieman\u2019s tenure.\n\nUP-HILL CHALLENGE\n\nThe Bulldogs\u2019 Kylin Hill needed just 17 carries to run for 211 yards and two scores against the Wildcats last season. The junior running back has been just as dynamic this season, going for 320 yards and two scores while averaging 7.8 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a difference-maker,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal tailback and can beat you in so many different ways. We need to do a good job keeping our leverage on him and doing a good job of tackling him.\u201d\n\nGROUND AND POUND\n\nMississippi State isn\u2019t the only team that can run the ball. The Wildcats have piled up a nation-leading 694 yards rushing through the first two weeks, and they have 10 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nQUARTERBACK QUESTIONS\n\nMississippi State quarterback Tommy Stevens was day-to-day this week after sustaining an upper-body injury against Southern Miss. He was 9 of 10 for 105 yards and two touchdowns before leaving late in the first half. If he\u2019s unable to go, junior Keytaon Thompson could play after spending about two weeks in the transfer portal after losing the competition for the starting job.\n\nSPEAKING OF QBS\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 Skylar Thompson spent a good chunk of last week\u2019s rout of Bowling Green standing on the sideline, his job done after establishing a big early lead. The junior quarterback is 26 of 35 for 363 yards and three touchdowns without an interception through the first two weeks.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take back anything from the first two games. I feel like we played great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to our leadership and the guys on our football team sticking together. When times get harder, that\u2019s when you have to come closer together and not pull apart and separate.\u201d\n\nFAMILIAR FACE\n\nWide receiver Isaiah Zuber was standing on the Kansas State sideline last season. He\u2019ll be on the Mississippi State sideline Saturday after switching schools as a graduate transfer.\n\n\u201cI am sure some of the guys will talk to him and pick his brain on maybe some specific skills or tendencies or what can you find,\u201d Moorhead said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nobody has to convince Mississippi State's Joe Moorhead or Kansas State counterpart Chris Klieman that the teams they will be facing Saturday will be well-coached and assignment-sound.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/southern_miss_mississippi_st_football_85950_c0-425-3179-2278_s1770x1032.jpg?22e86506c6ba902aa3f0d602fbc0fa74ff5cb9aa", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
