Apparently, parliament is sovereign but only if it obeys Boris Johnson\u2019s orders.\n\nHelen Bore\n\nScarborough\n\nA new use for the high street\n\nDon\u2019t let the lack of church halls and the demands of school nativity plays delay a December election.\n\nNearly every high street in the country has a multitude of vacant shops where the landlords would be delighted to see a modest income.\n\nAlastair Duncan\n\nBozburun, Turkey\n\nA look in the mirror\n\nThe police think a Chinese gang called \u201cSnakehead\u201d \u201cmay have been responsible\u201d for the deaths of 39 people whose bodies were discovered in the back of a lorry in Essex.\n\nActually, the \u201csnakes\u201d who created the conditions that led to the deaths of those desperate people are in a British criminal gang.\n\nThey\u2019re called the Tories and they have spent years created a \u201chostile environment\u201d against immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers and closing legitimate roads into the UK.\n\nThey have forced desperate people to seek alternative routes here, no matter how dangerous.\n\nLast month, Boris Johnson told the Tory conference: \u201cIf you come illegally, you are an illegal migrant and I\u2019m afraid the law will treat you as such. [...] We will send you back.\u201d\n\nAt that same conference, home secretary Priti Patel bragged to an audience apparently drunk on xenophobia that she would end freedom of movement \u201conce and for all\u201d.\n\nThe 39 dead in the back of that lorry were murdered by inhuman, racist Tory policies.\n\nThe Tories are the snakes with blood on their hands.\n\nSasha Simic\n\nLondon, N1\n\nSalma Yaqoob is an LGBT+ ally\n\nWe are LGBT+ activists who know and have worked with Salma Yaqoob. We wish to explain why we back her campaign to be Labour mayor for the West Midlands Metro region and our outrage at attempts to smear her.\n\nHer promotion of and participation in the annual Birmingham Pride strengthened its message of celebrating diversity and unity. It is a message she has taken beyond Birmingham, addressing countless community and campaigning events across the country.\n\nAs a Birmingham City councillor, Salma fought to put equalities for all at the top of the agenda. Not just in words, but ensuring effective measures in employment practice and other areas. She insisted on assessing the impact of council decisions on all minority or marginalised groups \u2013 well before the Equality Act 2010 made that a duty.\n\nWhen fringe groups tried to spread homophobia in her own ward she was not afraid to challenge them, taking up the argument at public meetings in front of hundreds of people. With facts and calm persuasion, she countered any bigotry and dispelled ignorance. It wasn\u2019t the easy thing to do. Many politicians would fear losing some popularity and prefer to say one thing to one group, something else to another.\n\nBut her confident message of mutual respect and building upon our multicultural society proved hugely popular. It changed minds.\n\nFar from hostility to LGBT+ people, Salma has worked across the spectrum to defend our rights, a particular inspiration for those of us who are also from African Caribbean and Asian communities. We need such people in elected office, representing Labour. Salma\u2019s effectiveness and ability to champion the oppressed won her numerous plaudits when she effectively tackled Ian Duncan Smith on Question Time over his inhumane universal credit system.\n\nAs LGBT+ campaigners, some of us for decades, we know that smears not only fuel Islamophobia, they also damage the cause of LGBT+ rights \u2013 which are not a football in someone else\u2019s political game. Such targeting of a Muslim political figure is plain wrong. Smearing them for stereotypical views they don\u2019t hold is an outrage. It divides communities where we need to bring them together.\n\nWe are backing her and ask others to do the same. If you decide otherwise, do it on the basis of democratic debate and real political issues, not dangerously divisive smears.\n\nOwen Jones, writer and journalist\n\nLady Phyll Opoku, (personal capacity)\n\nPav Akhtar, director, UK Black Pride\n\nMyriam Kane, Muslim LGBT+ activist, NUS Black Students\u2019 Committee 2018-2019\n\nAaron Kiely, Waltham Forest Pride co-founder (personal capacity)\n\nSometimes control is good\n\nAccording to an article in the media, it is reported that Meghan Markle is right that the British stiff upper lip is \u201cinternally damaging\u201d.\n\nHow on earth do they think that doctors and nurses, all emergency workers, medical people, social workers and care workers deal with harrowing and dangerous situations?\n\nI was employed as a local government social worker for over 30 years and became a troubleshooter for the department. I used to be sent out to deal with problems where other social workers had \u201cencountered problems\u201d. Seniors would ask me to please take over an interview with a certain social worker\u2019s client as that particular social worker \u201ccould not face aggression\u201d or that they found their client to be \u201csuch an evil person\u201d that they (the social worker) were afraid of losing their temper. I could not understand the latter as one of the first rules of being a social worker is \u201ccontrolled emotional involvement\u201d. As for the former, I wondered why they were in the job at all.\n\nBarbara MacArthur\u200b\n\nCardiff", "description": "The current political situation reminds me of the lead up to the Iraq War.
