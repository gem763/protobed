That dinner with your school pal can wait until next week, those networking drinks won\u2019t miss you. You\u2019re tired and rest is important. Pat on the back for you.\n\nBut, instead of an evening of restful bliss \u2013 a candle-lit bath, homemade nutritious food and a sensible two hours of Netflix \u2013 your free evening is plagued with uncomfortable feelings of guilt and regret.\n\nWe\u2019re calling it cancel anxiety, and it\u2019s really common.\n\nWhy does cancelling plans so often make us feel like this? Why is it so hard to sit with our decision to put ourselves first without feeling like we\u2019ve let everybody down?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll these worries are sabotaging our virtuous attempts to give ourselves a break, and it can become a bit of a vicious cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s a feeling that Donna, 30, knows all too well.\n\n\u2018I wear myself out trying make sure I make time for all my friends, family, the gym and work as well as \u201cliving my best life\u201d to the point where I\u2019m often stressed out about how many plans I have,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018But the minute I take any time off to just rest, I\u2019m filled with anxiety. Am I missing out? Am I being a bad friend? Am I secretly lazy because I want to spend the day at home in my pyjamas watching Netflix?\n\n\u2018I find that I spend the time when I have plans feeling anxious about how busy and tired I am and wishing I could have a break, and the minute I take a break, I feel anxious about not doing anything.\n\n\u2018On the rare occasion I do try to put my health first and cancel something as I know I need a rest, I feel instantly guilty and often end up cancelling my cancellation and going out anyway, or deciding that because I cancelled I need to make the most of my \u201ctime off\u201d and do one million chores instead.\n\n\u2018In short, it\u2019s exhausting.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about never really feeling like you\u2019ve made the right decision, and it makes me feel like I don\u2019t know myself that well\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe pressure to be constantly achieving can make you feel as though you have to fill your free time with productive things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s fuelled by social media, and the need to constantly perform to everyone you know how much fun you\u2019re having, how successful you are, how well you\u2019re doing. Cancelling a plan can feel like a missed opportunity to add to this narrative.\n\nHannah, 20, says she finds it really difficult to explain to her friends why she needs a night off.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve missed friend\u2019s birthdays, work drinks, just going out generally,\u2019 says Hannah. \u2018Sometimes, hearing \u201cwe missed you!\u201d is also really hard. It\u2019s almost as horrible a feeling as deciding to not go out in the first place.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so hard to express that you\u2019re just having a really hard time in that moment.\n\n\u2018I think that it\u2019s about never really feeling like you\u2019ve made the right decision, and it makes me feel like I don\u2019t know myself that well.\u2019\n\nHannah says the problem comes when she thinks she\u2019s doing the right thing for herself and her body, but then she gets conflicting messages telling her the opposite.\n\n\u2018It is just a constant struggle to do the \u201cright\u201d thing,\u2019 she adds.\n\n\u2018I end up really focusing on the event itself \u2013 looking on social media to make sure it was as chill as I thought it was going to be, or if it suddenly turned into the best night ever.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s also the need to apologise to the host and all the friends you\u2019re missing, which can be exhausting \u2013 even if the friends don\u2019t really care!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard of FOMO \u2013 the fear of missing out. It can cause us to pack our schedules with things we don\u2019t really want to do, just because the possibility of missing something fun is too stressful.\n\nBut cancel anxiety takes FOMO to the next level. We aren\u2019t only afraid of missing out, we often end up blaming ourselves, feeling guilt and shame for not making the right decision or berating ourselves for not having enough \u2018fun\u2019.\n\nThe accumulative effect of this can leave you feeling completely trapped. Say yes to every invitation and you\u2019ll be hurtling towards burnout, but if cancelling also causes you stress \u2013 what\u2019s the alternative?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s easy to forget that we must put ourselves first,\u2019 explains Neuro Linguistic Programming coach Rebecca Lockwood.\n\n\u2018If you feel as though you would prefer to be at home, relaxing, honour that. Also remember that if the reason you are declining is due to something else you have already committed to, or you would prefer to spend time with other people or yourself, maximise on that.\n\n\u2018Remember that it\u2019s OK to want to do other things and you don\u2019t need to explain that to anyone else or even yourself. There will be plenty of other opportunities to do things.\u2019\n\nRebecca thinks that one of the best ways to tackle this kind of anxiety is to make sure that you are fully at peace with spending time alone. She says that starts with the smallest of gestures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Always check in with yourself,\u2019 she says. \u2018Use a few minutes in the morning to set an intention for yourself and how you want your day and week to turn out.\n\n\u2018Be kind to yourself, not only in giving yourself some time to rest, but also being aware of the inner chatter you have in your mind.\n\n\u2018If you find yourself talking to yourself negatively, just stop for a moment, place your hand on your heart take a deep breath and tell yourself \u201cyou are OK, you are proud of you and you will have a lovely day whatever you do\u201d.\u2019\n\nAlex calls himself the FOMO King. He says the anxiety he gets from cancelling plans often means he says yes to everything \u2013 no matter how exhausted it leaves him.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m constantly doing things with various groups of friends, and then when I feel I\u2019m burning out and dedicate a weekend or a few evenings to myself, I feel guilty for cancelling on certain friends,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018Or I feel jealous seeing people out on their Instagram stories.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m always telling myself\u2019 \u201conce you\u2019re out and have a drink you\u2019ll enjoy it\u201d, but this weekend for example \u2013 I can\u2019t decide whether the tiredness from going out again was worth the lack of FOMO.\u2019\n\nSophie, 29, agrees. She has a manic work schedule, so her weekends are precious \u2013 but she feels the pressure to fill them up with plans even though she knows she needs to rest.\n\n\u2018Society tells us that we need to see our friends, party, go to the gym or any other things that are deemed to be ingredients that together make up a \u201clife\u201d on the weekends,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018When in reality, sometimes all I want to do is spend time by myself. So, I frequently cancel plans because I just don\u2019t have the energy or feel like I\u2019m forced to do stuff.\n\n\u2018Sadly, it\u2019s a vicious cycle, because then I feel guilty or anxious because I haven\u2019t done anything all weekend.\n\n\u2018Take sleeping in, for example. I get up around 6am most days during the week, but then when I decide to lie in until 10am on a weekend, I feel sad and guilty because shouldn\u2019t I be doing something?\u2019\n\n\u2018I spent years feeling like I was the \u201cflakey friend\u201d\u2018 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nEmma Case is a life coach, she says that in order to shift those feelings of guilt and turn rest into something positive \u2013 you have to be completely open with your friends and peers.\n\n\u2018I spent years feeling like I was the \u201cflakey friend\u201d,\u2019 says Emma. \u2018I felt guilty, that I was forever letting people down. I found it hard to be honest about why I was cancelling.\n\n\u2018The turning point was experiencing a serious case of burnout and exhaustion, and my priorities had to shift.\n\n\u2018Truthfully, I still cancel from time to time, the only difference is that now I\u2019m completely honest about why. Simply put, telling a friend that you\u2019re tired and genuinely need to rest is honourable and strengthens bonds. It also reduces the feeling of stress.\n\n\u2018FOMO still occasionally creeps up on me, I\u2019m only human! The difference now is that I\u2019m less concerned.\u2019\n\nHow to cope with cancel anxiety 1. Focus on yourself 100%. If you\u2019ve taken the time to prioritise your well-being, don\u2019t spend the evening feeling guilt or regret. Learn to enjoy your party for one. 2. Remember that FOMO is normal. We all experience it at times. My tried and tested affirmation on these occasions: \u2018next time will be even better!\u2019 3. Unfollow/mute friends on social media for 24 hours and tell them not to tag you in any photos. Emma Case, life coach\n\nIt\u2019s really important to remember to listen to your body.\n\nIf you want to cancel plans and go to bed, that\u2019s not you being lazy, that\u2019s your body telling you to take a break \u2013 and being aware of those signals is the best way to keep your body and your mind healthy.\n\nAs Emma says, honestly really is the best policy. Chances are, all your mates feel just as exhausted as you do, so normalising the concept of taking a night off without the need for an elaborate excuse might be the best thing for all of you.\n\nSimply saying \u2013 I can\u2019t tonight, my body needs a rest \u2013 should be enough. And if your friends truly care about you, they will understand.\n\nMORE: Woman who survived kidney and liver transplants becomes athletics star\n\nMORE: Airbnb introduces ethical animal experiences for tourists worldwide\n\nMORE: Nine-year-old paints stunning animal portraits to buy resources for shelters\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "How to cope with cancel anxiety - the feelings of guilt that can ruin your free time after you make the decision to cancel plans.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sei_44075834-9b20_1571668512.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
