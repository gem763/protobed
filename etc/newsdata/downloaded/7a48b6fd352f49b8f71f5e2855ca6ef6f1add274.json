But higher premiums have eaten into the saving from that drop for spot buyers.\n\nAluminium is a vital material for the transport and packaging industries and is mostly sold on annual contracts with prices determined on a quarterly basis.\n\nHigher premiums will only impact European consumers that have to buy on the spot physical market because they need more than expected.\n\n\u201cMetal is locked in financing deals and so is not readily available to the physical market. It is a shortage driven by demand from financial participation rather than physical demand,\u201d said Wood Mackenzie analyst Kamil Wlazly.\n\nTypically, financing deals are rolled over on a monthly basis, but some recent deals are for longer periods and will not mature until later this year or in 2020.\n\nWeak demand for aluminium in the spot market is in itself feeding into higher premiums. Financing deals have the potential to make more money when the contango in the market - the discount for the cash over longer-term contracts - is strong.\n\nA deeper discount tends to reflect weakness in near-term demand, which holds cash prices down.\n\nThe discount for the cash over the three-month contract on the LME is currently at around $30 a tonne, while the three-month contract is some $61 a tonne below August 2020 metal.\n\n\u201cThose numbers are significant, given the costs of financing came down again,\u201d a physical aluminium trader said referring to an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve at the end of July.\n\n\u201cThe premium moved over $100 after the rate cut and now I can\u2019t find any offers below $115. There is a lot of metal very tightly held in these cash and carry deals.\u201d\n\nAnalysts estimate total global aluminium stocks have risen to nearly 11 million tonnes from below 10 million tonnes in May. Most of that is held in financing deals, much of it in Europe, aluminium trading sources say.", "description": "The large amount of aluminium tied up in financing deals, made more lucrative by cheaper credit, has eroded the benefits of lower benchmark prices for European consumers needing to buy on the spot market.", "authors": ["Pratima Desai", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425337933&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810OK"}
