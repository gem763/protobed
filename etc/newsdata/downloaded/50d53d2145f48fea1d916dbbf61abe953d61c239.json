Broadcasters urged civilians to stay away from the areas that had been hit.\n\nThe reported operation came two days after officials in Saudi Arabia held a press conference to display debris from drones and cruise missiles, which they claimed proved Iran was involved in the oil attack. Iran has repeatedly denied it was involved and has vowed to defend itself.\n\nEarlier, the US said it was starting the task of building a coalition to deter purported Iranian threats. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said that Mr Trump, who has ordered more sanctions on Iran, wanted a peaceful solution to the crisis.\n\nMr Pompeo was speaking after holding talks with Saudi and Emirati leaders over the strike that Washington and Riyadh have blamed on Tehran. \u201cWe are here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution,\u201d said Mr Pompeo.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6086824440001\n\nDonald Trump on Iran: \u2018I don\u2019t want a war but US is more prepared than any country\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my mission, that\u2019s what President Trump certainly wants me to work to achieve and I hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran sees it that way.\u201d\n\nMr Pompeo did not provide details about the coalition. The United States has, however, been trying to create a global maritime security alliance since attacks on oil tankers in Gulf waters, which Washington also blamed on Iran.\n\nThe UAE, Saudi Arabia, Britain and Bahrain have said they will participate. Iraq said it would not join, and most European countries have been reluctant to sign up for fear of stoking regional tensions.\n\nThe military operation against Houthi rebels has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties and created a massive humanitarian crisis in one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\nMr Trump has overruled efforts by politicians in the congress to end military support for Saudi Arabia, which the president considers a major ally. Critics of Saudi Arabia accuse it of widespread human rights abuses, and of the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n\nRead more\n\nHow can you \u2018accidentally\u2019 sell military equipment to Saudi Arabia?\n\nSaudi oil production to resume as US believes Iran behind attack\n\nIsrael-Saudi connivance is the real Middle East game-changer\n\nTrump threatens Iran after Saudi Arabia oil attack", "description": "The Saudi-led military coalition has reportedly carried out attacks on targets in Yemen \u2013 its first response since an assault on oil facilities that the US has blamed on Iran.The strikes hit areas north of Yemen\u2019s port city of Hodeidah, Saudi state TV reported.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oPuvhnKvLhkiAiNCQ3Z_Ng--~B/aD0zNDE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/f4eb2b57a5104dd48bcc106b5317854f", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
