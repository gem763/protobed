It made a simple day out turn very sour actually.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Keedwell Image caption Mr Keedwell had told police he had \"no case to answer\"\n\nMr Keedwell claimed he had \"no case to answer\" and recruited the help of a video and electronics expert who told the court the speed camera may have been triggered by a car in an adjacent lane or have been faulty.\n\nHowever, he said it took four trips to Worcester Magistrates' Court before his appeal was heard. After losing the case, he lost a further crown court appeal in August.\n\nMr Keedwell said he expected the case would be \"fairly quick\" but had spent \"the best part of \u00a330,000\", including about \u00a321,000 in barristers' fees and \u00a37,000 in court costs, as well as travel expenses.\n\nYou may be interested in:\n\nMr Keedwell said he felt guilty his family would miss out and said the case had proved \"very stressful\".\n\n\"I'm sick and tired at the whole system which is steamrolling ordinary people,\" he said.\n\n\"I regret the amount of money. I very simply wanted justice.\"\n\nA CPS spokesman said some issues raised by the defence led to the need for additional hearings and for expert evidence to be obtained.\n\n\"As the case involved both a lengthy trial at the magistrates' court and subsequent hearings at the crown court to progress an appeal against conviction, the overall length of the case took some time to conclude,\" they said.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.", "description": "Richard Keedwell \"simply wanted justice\" but has lost his savings and his sons' inheritance money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8298/production/_108723433_richardkeedwell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
