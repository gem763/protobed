Shortly before the vote on Thursday, Johnson revealed he would give MPs more time to scrutinize his Brexit legislation if they vote for a general election on Monday.\n\nHis legislative plans included bills to deliver Brexit and forge a new relationship with the EU, increase sentencing for serious crimes and overhaul the rail network. Plans to crack down on drone use, boost environmental protections and make voters show photo ID before they cast their ballots were also included.\n\nAfter he unveiled the 26 proposed bills last Monday, Johnson said the plans offer \u201ca new age of opportunity for the whole country.\u201d\n\nBut opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThe prime minister promised that this queen's speech would dazzle us.
