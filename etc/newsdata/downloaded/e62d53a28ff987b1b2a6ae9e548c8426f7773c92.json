You\u2019ve gotta set that up yourself by creating a sequence of Siri Shortcuts. \u201cIt is legit insane that importing a photo to Lightroom on a 1000 dollar tablet takes two steps and writing a macro,\u201d Nilay told me in Slack just minutes ago.\n\nAlso, he says it doesn\u2019t let you specify whether you only want to import RAWs or JPEGs, and you can\u2019t have Lightroom apply one of your own user-generated presets to each photo \u2014 only the default ones.\n\nIt\u2019s a start.", "description": "Apple promised a Siri Shortcut that would automatically import photos from an iPad Pro camera roll into Adobe Lightroom CC, then delete original  from the camera roll.
