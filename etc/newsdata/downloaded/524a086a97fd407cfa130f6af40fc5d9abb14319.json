Two years ago, Oregon became the first state to officially accommodate such residents by allowing them to select an X in the gender field of their driver\u2019s license to convey that their gender is nonbinary or unspecified.\n\nSince then, another eight states and the District of Columbia have followed suit, and at least six more states say they will make the change in the coming months. Nine states plus New York City allow people to change the gender field on their birth certificate to a nonbinary marker. Most states allow such changes without an explanation.\n\nThe moves are part of a broader shift toward recognizing gender-nonconforming Americans. The ride-sharing service Lyft Inc. and several major airlines this year began allowing customers to select gender-neutral pronouns on their service profiles and tickets. Mastercard Inc. recently launched a \u201cTrue Name\u201d card geared toward transgender customers that allows them to put the name of their choice on their credit card even if it doesn\u2019t match their legal moniker.\n\nC.P.

International law firm Baker McKenzie in June said its workforce diversity targets now include having partners and other professionals who are gender nonbinary.\n\n\u201cThe developments are moving so fast,\u201d said Jessica Clarke, a Vanderbilt Law School professor who studies gender identity.\n\nThe issue has spilled onto the 2020 campaign trail. Several of the Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker, want the federal government to issue passports and other forms of ID with a nonbinary gender option. Canada, Germany, Australia, India and other countries offer a similar option on national identity documents. The Trump administration has blocked such efforts in courts, and the Obama administration did, too. A State Department official declined to comment on the issue, citing pending litigation.\n\nSome state Republican lawmakers and conservative groups have tried to block the changes. \u201cGovernment documents shouldn\u2019t reflect personal opinions,\u201d said Jonathan Keller, chief executive of the California Family Council, a religious policy group that unsuccessfully fought the change in the Golden State. \u201cThey need to reflect biological facts for identification and medical purposes.\u201d\n\nMatt Sharp, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group, said that such changes complicate the government\u2019s ability to track life expectancy and diseases by gender and raise thorny issues for the enforcement of laws designed to expand opportunities for women, such as Title IX. \u201cDoes a school now have to create a new category of sports and new athletic opportunities for individuals with the X designation on their birth certificate?\u201d he asked.\n\nC.P. Hoffman, a 40-year-old Greenbelt, Md., attorney who identifies as nonbinary, plans to get a new driver\u2019s license with an X in the gender field when Maryland begins issuing them Oct. 1. Mx. Hoffman, who uses the gender-neutral honorific, said showing a license to get into a bar or to join a store loyalty program has often been uncomfortable because the ID\u2019s gender marker didn\u2019t feel accurate.\n\n\u201cHaving an ID that recognizes who you are is really so vital to moving through this world,\u201d Mx. Hoffman said.\n\nA 2016 study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law found that 0.6% of U.S. adults, about 1.4 million, identify as transgender\u2014when gender identity is different from sex at birth\u2014based on responses from a federal health survey; it didn\u2019t specify the share that is gender nonconforming. A Pew Research survey earlier this year found that about a third of Gen Z and a quarter of millennials know someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nAkiva Wolberg, who is gender nonconforming, switched to a District of Columbia driver\u2019s license with an X gender marker two years ago.

She noted that, instead of explicitly recognizing a third gender marker, some municipalities have made it optional to include any kind of sex designation on documents.\n\nAkiva Wolberg, who is gender nonconforming, switched to a District of Columbia driver\u2019s license with an X gender marker two years ago. The 31-year-old database administrator said that it hasn\u2019t created any problems and that most people who view the ID don\u2019t seem to notice it is different.\n\nMx. Wolberg said those who oppose the ID changes are overlooking the fact that transgender people\u2019s licenses don\u2019t achieve the stated function of identity documents. \u201cIf a lot of people think I look like a guy, and my license says F, then the F is obviously not doing a very good job of proving who I say I am, which is the entire point of an ID.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jennifer Calfas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Janet Adamy at janet.adamy@wsj.com", "description": "A growing number of states and companies are allowing people to designate their gender as \u201cX\u201d instead of male or female on driver\u2019s licenses and other forms of identification.", "authors": ["Janet Adamy", "Janet.Adamy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103153/social"}
