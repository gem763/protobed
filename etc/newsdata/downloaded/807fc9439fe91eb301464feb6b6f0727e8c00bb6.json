REUTERS/Naomi Tajitsu/File Photo\n\nToyota is using Panasonic\u2019s cylindrical batteries in its new Corolla and Levin plug-in hybrid sedans launched in China this year, one of the people said.\n\nThe batteries are the same size as those that Panasonic makes for Tesla, but the composition is different, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the matter is private.\n\nThe move reflects Toyota\u2019s efforts to secure stable supplies of high-quality batteries amid the accelerated global shift to electricity-powered cars.\n\nJapan\u2019s biggest automaker co-developed the batteries with Panasonic over a period of several years as it expands its lineup of electrified vehicles, according to one of the people, who has direct knowledge of matter.\n\nA Panasonic spokeswoman said the company is not in a position to comment as a supplier, while Toyota declined to comment.\n\nThe Nikkei newspaper reported the news earlier.\n\nToyota has favoured square, or prismatic, batteries for its vehicles, and uses some manufactured by Panasonic for its hybrids. The two companies announced a joint venture in January to build electric-vehicle (EV) batteries, pooling the R&D and manufacturing strengths of one of the world\u2019s largest automakers with one of the largest battery makers.\n\nToyota has also partnered with China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) (300750.SZ) and EV maker BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) for battery procurement.\n\nToyota is believed to have ordered about 50,000 of the cylindrical batteries, pushing Panasonic\u2019s battery plant in Osaka to full capacity, the Nikkei said.\n\nPanasonic has been the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, but the U.S. electric vehicle maker is in advanced talks with South Korea\u2019s LG Chem Ltd (051910.KS) as it seeks to diversify sources of the key component.", "description": "Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has started using the same type of battery that Panasonic Corp <6752.T> designed for Tesla Inc in some of its plug-in hybrids sold in China, sources familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Kevin Buckland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429332619&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C07J", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
