However, the Capetonians did not have the right ammunition in the final third to pose any real threat to the Bucs defence.\n\nInstead, the hosts showcased a free-flowing game with Linda Mntambo calling the shots in the middle of the park in his rare start for Bucs.\n\nVincent Pule also came close on numerous occasions. Each time he was in the opponents\u2019 goal area he looked like he was going to cause problems.\n\nFor a change, there was also stability at the back for the Bucs, whose rearguard ranks among the most porous in the league.\n\nSandilands was reinstalled in goal ahead of Joris Delle who shipped in seven goals in Bucs\u2019 last three league games.\n\nWhile Bucs interim coach Rhulani Mokwena registered his second victory in seven games since he took over, the struggle continues for the team from the Windelands district.\n\nCoach Steve Barker\u2019s team arrived in Soweto last night having won just one game in eight league outings.\n\nThey recorded their victory, a 2-0 win over Polokwane City on October 2.\n\nPirates will next face Highlands Park on Tuesday before they travel to Cape Town for a clash with Stellenbosch on Saturday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Despite achieving their glory the hard way, Soweto clubs triumphed over their Cape Town rivals with both Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs advancing to the quarter-finals of the Telkom Knockout yesterday.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae At Orlando Stadium"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9495/ecb49515eb0042c885d201ef9ded645c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
