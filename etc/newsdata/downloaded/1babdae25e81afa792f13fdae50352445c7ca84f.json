Does that means it's deemed less trustworthy?\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Facebook on Friday began rolling out its dedicated \"news tab\" with professionally produced content -- the latest move by the social network to promote journalism and shed its reputation as a platform for misinformation.
