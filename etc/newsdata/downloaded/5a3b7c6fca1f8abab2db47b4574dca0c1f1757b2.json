I feel terribly sorry for Harry\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cBy leaving the country the driver has made it 10 times worse for a family already grieving.\u201d\n\nIn Judy\u2019s case the American did not escape justice.\n\nShe explained: \u201cThe other driver never spoke to me but I could hear him saying he was going back to the States tomorrow, needed a new hire car and how he had a plane to catch.\n\n\u201cI asked the police \u2018Are you going to let him get away with it?\u2019 and they said \u2018no we\u2019ll keep him in custody tonight, he will be dealt with in court tomorrow and then can go home\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is better than what Harry\u2019s family has had to put up with.\u201d\n\nFor several decades RAF Croughton, Northants, has been loaned to America as a spy listening station.\n\nIn 1994 diplomatic immunity was granted to all working there and their families. It has been used by Sacoolas to escape justice over the fatal crash on August 27.\n\nJudy\u2019s accident was in 1989, meaning police could prosecute the driver.\n\nThe smash happened when he pulled out on the wrong side in the village of Aynho, two miles from where Harry died.\n\nRecalling the trauma, Judy, of Deddington, Oxon, said: \u201cAs I turned the bend a car went straight into me. He must have glanced left and turned right thinking he was in America.\u201d\n\nJudy believes the diplomatic deal about the RAF base should be rewritten.\n\nHarry Dunn\u2019s parents are to meet Northamptonshire\u2019s Chief Constable and demand to know why Sacoolas was not immediately arrested after the crash.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Judy Chard, from Northamptonshire, suffered severe whiplash and knee injuries in the crash near RAF Croughton", "authors": ["Louie Smith", "Andy Lines"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS196069511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
