Mitt Romney has admitted to using a secret Twitter account to monitor and comment on political discussions not only to defend himself but also to criticize other high-profile players- including President Donald Trump.\n\nInterested in Mitt Romney? Add Mitt Romney as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Mitt Romney news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe tale began when, in a lengthy profile about the senator, The Atlantic\u2019s McKay Coppins asked Romney about his social media habits and the senator admitted to having a \u201clurker\u201d account on Twitter that he could use to secretly track certain topics and conversations.\n\nHidden in his answers was enough information for Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg to link Romney to Twitter user @qaws9876, though now known by its more eyebrow-raising display name -- \"Pierre Delecto.\"\n\nCQ-Roll Call via Getty Images, FILE\n\nOne of the ways Feinberg was able to connect Romney to Delecto was by comparing who the two accounts were following.\n\nThe very first account Delecto followed was none other than Romney\u2019s eldest son Tagg, followed by Glen Johnson, who was covering Romney around the time the account was created, as well as several advisers to Romney, including Mark DeMoss and Eric Fehrnstrom.\n\nSince the Slate piece was published, Coppins reached out to Romney to ask about the newly-discovered Twitter account, to which the senator confirmed, \u201cC'est moi,'\" or, in English, \"It's me.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nAlthough the account has since been changed to private- hiding all likes, retweets, and the 10 tweets made by the user- Feinberg managed to take screenshots and embed most of the relevant posts in her article.\n\nReplying to a post by Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, who had shared a piece by Politico criticizing Romney\u2019s strategy in dealing with Trump, Delecto tweeted, \u201cJennifer, you need to take a breath. Maybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure.\u201d\n\nTwitter via Slate.com\n\nSimilarly, former CNN anchor and current talk show host Soledad O\u2019Brien commented on Romney\u2019s \u201cutter lack of a moral compass\u201d for considering not endorsing Trump in 2020. Delecto responded to her, saying, \u201conly Republican to hit Trump on Meuller (sic) report, only one to hit Trump on character time and again, so Soledad, you think he\u2019s the one without moral compass?\u201d\n\nTwitter via Slate.com\n\nRomney has been attacked by Trump critics for not taking stronger -- and more public -- stands against the president. The Delecto account provided Romney with a means of speaking his mind regarding Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nMore recently, the account explicitly attacked Trump for his, \u201cawful decision\u201d to withdraw troops from Syria, which Romney has publicly condemned, adding, \u201cbut what could the Senate do to stop it?\u201d\n\nTwitter via Slate.com\n\nThough the senator has not revealed the source of his alias, Twitter users have been trying everything from anagrams to Latin translations in an attempt to decode some hidden meaning, with no luck as of yet.\n\n#PierreDelecto started trending nationally across Twitter early Monday, beginning with confusion and quickly evolving to become the joke of the day.\n\nDavid Dennison and Pierre Delecto.

Angelo (@gregorytangelo) October 21, 2019\n\nUsers were quick to point out that Delecto is just the latest in a long line of secret \"lurker\" accounts used by politicians and other public figures to keep an eye on discussions about themselves or participate in conversations they might otherwise be unable to with their official accounts.\n\nIf trying to keep-up with role-playing and fictional names in politics:\n\n\n\nAnthony Weiner: \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d\n\n\n\nPeter Navarro: \u201cRon Vara\u201d\n\n\n\nMitt Romney: \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: \u201cJohn Barron\u201d, \u201cJohn Miller\u201d, \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d, \u201cIndividual One\u201d, \u201cPOTUS\u201d, \u201cCommander in Chief\u201d.... \u2014 Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas (@ananavarro) October 21, 2019\n\nOne comparison being made is between Delecto and James Comey's secret Twitter account under the name Reinhold Niebuhr- which also caught the attention of thousands of Twitter users when it was first discovered.\n\neven mitt romney (mitt romney!) had a more fun twitter handle than james comey's \"reinhold niebuhr\" \u2014 Matthew Zeitlin (@MattZeitlin) October 21, 2019\n\nIn fact, this is not even the first time Romney used a fake name.\n\nAccording to the Stanford Daily in 2012, when Romney was a freshman at Stanford University, he used the name \u201cTim Yenmor,\u201d or Mitt Romney backwards without one T, when he was quoted in an article about school pranks.", "description": "After some clever reporting by Slate's Ashley Feinberg, Sen.
