Beto O\u2019Rourke wants to confiscate firearms in America. Hey, let\u2019s give him some credit: he\u2019s honest and exposed the Democratic Party\u2019s ultimate gun control goal on live television. The 2020 candidate went off in last week\u2019s Democratic debate, where he flat out said that so-called assault weapons will be confiscated if he\u2019s elected president. Liberals do indeed have short memories. Al Gore very well could have been elected president in 2000 if it weren\u2019t for gun control. It cost him Arkansas, West Virginia, and his home state of Tennessee. Even with Bush winning Florida that year\u2014Gore still would\u2019ve won. Since then, it\u2019s been a lot of \u2018we support the Second Amendment, but\u2026\u2019 talk from the Left. We all knew their agenda was the destruction of the Second Amendment and gun confiscation, so yes\u2014thank you, Bob, for giving up the charade, being honest, and pushing voters into the arms of Donald J. Trump. Only the most insane liberals are for this. For gun-owning Democrats, well, they\u2019re very much like the GOP: hand off!\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), one of the few conservative-leaning Democrats on the Hill, had a pointed message for Beto. You\u2019re not getting my firearms\u2014ever (via Daily Caller):\n\nDem Sen. @JoeManchinWV on Beto pledge to confiscate AR15s:\n\n\n\n\"Beto's one human being. He gave his own opinion, OK? I think it was very harmful to make it look like all the Democrats. I can tell you one thing: @BetoORourke's not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that OK?\" \u2014 Lindsay Wise (@lindsaywise) September 18, 2019\n\nDemocratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told a reporter Wednesday that Beto O\u2019Rourke was not going to take his guns away. \u201cBeto\u2019s one human being. He gave his own opinion, OK? I think it was very harmful to make it look like all the Democrats. I can tell you one thing: [O\u2019Rourke]\u2019s not taking my guns away from me,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Lindsay Wise. [\u2026] O\u2019Rourke previously held a more moderate line on gun control and the Second Amendment, but in the last two months he has shifted radically to the left, endorsing the idea of mandatory gun buybacks for AR-15s and other weapons. The Texas politician thinks that gun confiscation would work because Americans would simply comply.\n\nYeah, how is that AR-15 certification going in Boulder, Colorado? Even Democrats who own rifles and live there aren\u2019t complying. The good news is that Bob won\u2019t be allowed to enact this law because he won\u2019t win the nomination. The problem is his colleagues following his lead.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:18:01PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/232/2e36a60a-98d3-480a-b7ad-9f5e6d9a8a3c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
