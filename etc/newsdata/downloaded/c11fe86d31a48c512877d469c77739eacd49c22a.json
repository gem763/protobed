While online trolls lashed out at her over the images.\n\nStriking shots show five-year-old Kynadee in full zombie Halloween make up snarling at the camera\n\nGruesome photos of 10-month-old Kamden show the baby sitting in a bucket of 'blood', gnawing on a brain in a horror-inspired photo shoot in the family's back garden Oklahoma\n\nAlthough the feedback was overwhelmingly positive, Bobbi's pictures managed to upset certain internet trolls who said that her children were unsafe and should be taken away from her. Some people even compared her baby shoot to an abortion scene.\n\n'My photos are just my kiddos dressed up as zombies for Halloween - I wanted to do something fun in a photo shoot for the kids for Halloween.\n\n'I got a few ideas from Pinterest but I wanted to put my own spin on it with the bath. I was originally going to do a milk bath with pumpkins for fall, but I thought I would try this instead.\n\n'I do want to convey that my children are very, very well taken care of. This was just for fun. Many people have said that my children should be taken from me and I know that is not true.\n\nBobbi Rylant with Kynadee and Kamden. She's faced horrible internet trolls following her horror-inspired shoot\n\nThe shots, including this one of 10-month-old Kamden, have been compared to an 'abortion scene'\n\nThe homemade set up made form some fabulously gory shots - including her daughter holding a fake brain\n\n'My kids are the most important things in my life and they are always happy & healthy.\n\n'There are some people that do not like the images, and I knew there would be, which is why I stated in my post that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but most people love this idea and want to try it with their own kids or clients.\n\n'I would also like to add that these were very quick shoots. My son was in that bucket for maybe 10 minutes tops. He gets distracted easily & I never force anyone to stay where they are for photos. I just took photos until he was uninterested in splashing and playing with the brain toy.\n\n'I never expected this to blow up like it has. I only posted the photos for fun to show my Facebook family/friends and people just started sharing it like crazy. I was very surprised that happened!'\n\nThe mother said that the photoshoot was just a bit of fun and her children are the 'most important things in my life and they are always happy & healthy'\n\nThe photographer revealed that many people didn't like the photos of her children, including this one of her son Kamden, in a fake blood bath\n\nScarily convincing, Bobbi explained how she made up her amazing sets.\n\n'The gash is a temporary tattoo from the Halloween store,' explained the 26-year-old, who runs her business Photos by Bobbi.\n\n'The bath is warm water and cherry Kool-Aid mix. The stuff on his head is just strawberry & chocolate syrup mixed together and the brain is just a prop from a local Halloween store.\n\n'Kamden's photos were in the backyard and Kynadee's was at a nearby lake.'\n\nBobbi, who says halloween is a fun holiday but not her favourite, did admit there were a couple of hairy moments during the shoots- but that the children never stopped having fun.\n\nBobbi revealed that the 'blood' bath that her son is sitting in, is warm water and cherry Kool-Aid mix. While the stuff on his head is strawberry & chocolate syrup mixed together\n\nThe fake brain is just a prop from a local Halloween store and the mother said that her son had fun splashing in the bath\n\nShe added: 'The only problems I had to overcome during the shoots was the clean-up! They both enjoyed it and we all had a lot of fun.\n\n'I did have one instance where my daughter was dressed up and stepped on a splinter at the lake and started to cry. I was hoping no one would think I was hurting her since she looked all bloody & was screaming!\n\n'We got the splinter out of her foot quickly though and she was good for the rest of the shoot.\n\n'What I really love about this is just that it's fun and it has also helped my five-year-old not to be afraid. I can now show her the photos of herself 'dressed up scary' and explain that monsters and zombies aren't real at all, they're just regular people dressed up just like she was!\n\n'So it has really helped her not to be afraid of or believe in monsters, something so many kids her age struggle with.'", "description": "The spooky snaps were taken by Bobbi Rylant, 26, from\u00a0Oklahoma, who is\u00a0a part-time photographer and mother of two, for a bit of seasonal fun.
