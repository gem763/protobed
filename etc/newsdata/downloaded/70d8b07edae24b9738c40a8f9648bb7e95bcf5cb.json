Ran for 214 metres and did plenty more work off the ball. Came off in the 70th minute with cramp. 8.5\n\nNick Cotric - Energetic but too eager at times and forced the pass. Still finished with 127 metres from 16 carries. 6.5\n\nJarrod Croker - Strong in defence and played his heart out but made three errors and conceded a penalty. 6\n\nJoey Leilua - Ran hard all night and almost scored a few times but also threw a dummy to Jordan Rapana who would have scored in the corner to go ahead in the 60th minute. 7.5\n\nJordan Rapana - Worked hard out his own half and tried to get into the game all night, finished with 125 metres and two tackle busts. 7\n\nJack Wighton - The best player on the ground looked threatening whenever he touched the ball. Stepped off his left nicely to score the Raiders' first try and was typically immense in defence. Won the Clive Churchill medal in a losing side. 9.5\n\nAidan Sezer - Struggled to provide the rhythm for Canberra's attack and missed six tackles but kicked reasonably well. 5.5\n\nJosh Papalii - The hardest worker on the field once again ran his heart out with 143 metres and made 31 tackles in an enormous effort. 8.5\n\nJosh Hodgson - Another typical captain's knock as he organised Canberra in attack and defence, making 32 tackles but missing seven. 6.5\n\nSia Soliola - Worked hard all night with 29 tackles and ran for 86 metres. 7\n\nJohn Bateman - Nobody made more than his 41 tackles and the England star looked threatening at times in attack. 8\n\nElliott Whitehead - Tried to barge over out of dummy-half for the Raiders first try but was held up on the fifth tackle. Made 36 tackles and ran 59 metres. 7\n\nJoseph Tapine - Gave away two penalties in the first 20 minutes but made 34 tackles and ran with vigour all night. 6.5\n\nBench\n\nBailey Simonsson - Came on in the final 10 minutes but couldn't create the match-winning play. 5\n\nEmre Guler - Honest shift with nine tackles and 66 run metres. 6\n\nCorey Horsburgh - Great grand final for a rookie. The tough as nails Queenslander made 19 tackles and worked hard all night. 7.5\n\nDunamis Lui - Made an error at the end of the first half which put the Raiders under pressure and ran for just 40 metres. 5.5", "description": "CANBERRA NRL GRAND FINAL PLAYER RATINGSCharnze Nicoll-Klokstad - Terrific performance in the biggest game of his young career.
