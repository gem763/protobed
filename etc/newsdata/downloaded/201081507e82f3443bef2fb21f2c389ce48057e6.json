Rapidly climbing property prices led homeowners to use their homes as piggy banks, fueling consumer spending.\n\nBut a resurgent housing market after the Great Recession hasn\u2019t brought with it a return to Helocs, as they\u2019re commonly known. Home equity lines have fallen by almost half in the past decade, New York Fed data show. The loans, which comprised 5% of the nation\u2019s banking assets in 2009, now account for less than 2%, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nRecord levels of home equity -- spurred by soaring home prices and stagnant mortgage borrowing -- haven\u2019t prompted households to use a ready resource as a way to fund big-ticket purchases or home improvements. Finance executives have spent years researching the issue, commissioning surveys and studies to figure out how to jump-start a business that had always been a reliable and relatively low-risk source of earnings.\n\nFallout from the housing bubble appears to have had a lasting effect on consumers\u2019 willingness to keep using their homes as an ATM. Just 4% of households had an open home equity line in 2016, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent comprehensive survey of households\u2019 finances, a far cry from the 10% that annually borrowed against the equity in their homes during the 2000s.\n\n\u201cThe Heloc market has been in decline since 2008,\u201d said Otto Pohl, a spokesman at Figure, a financial-technology firm that offers a type of Heloc. In the \u201cbubble years,\u201d Pohl said, banks almost as a matter of course added home equity lines along with a borrower\u2019s initial mortgage.\n\nThose days are gone. At Bank of America Corp., the nation\u2019s second-biggest bank by assets, Helocs produced $552 million of interest income in the third quarter, down two-thirds from a decade ago. Interest rates on the loans were the third-highest among the lender\u2019s various types of assets, trailing only credit cards and a catchall category called \u201cother.\u201d\n\nEquity Growth\n\nU.S. homeowners collectively had $6.3 trillion of housing equity they could borrow against as of June, according to analytics firm Black Knight Inc., more than double the $2.6 trillion total in 2009.\n\nFinance-industry executives cite three culprits they think are probably responsible for the gradual demise of Helocs: An unusual trend in interest-rate spreads, easy access to unsecured personal loans from online lenders and psychological scars from the housing bust.\n\nHome equity lines function like credit cards, in that lenders set a maximum amount that homeowners can borrow at any one time. Also like credit cards, they\u2019re based on the prime rate, with lenders charging a bit extra depending on a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. The prime rate, now at 5%, moves with the federal funds rate set by the Fed.\n\nThat\u2019s more expensive than the typical 30-year mortgage, an interest rate that generally tracks the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The average rate on a new Heloc was 6.45% as of Sept. 30, according to Informa Financial Intelligence. Borrowers looking to exchange equity for cash in a refinancing are being offered an average rate of 3.99%.\n\nWhen mortgage rates are at least 1 percentage point lower than the rate on Helocs, borrowers looking to pull equity from their homes typically opt for a cash-out refinancing over a home equity line of credit, said Rutger van Faassen, a vice president of consumer lending at Informa. Add to that the fact that a new mortgage offers a fixed rate instead of the variable Heloc and the option becomes even more attractive, he said.\n\nUnsecured personal loans pose another threat to the Heloc business. Many online lenders offer cash in a day, and years of quick turnaround times with their online purchases have conditioned consumers to expect speed when they access credit, said Mark Ford, head of personal lending and card solutions at SunTrust Banks Inc.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A once-popular loan Americans use to finance home renovations and college tuition is slowly dying, slashing a lucrative source of revenue for the nation\u2019s largest banks.Home equity lines of credit, open-ended loans that homeowners tap for cash using their properties as collateral, exploded", "authors": ["Gwen Everett", "Shahien Nasiripour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3ak1OjPcFVowKaorwb_PVg--~B/aD0yOTQ7dz01MjQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/265429c0-f984-11e9-bedf-7f4dea0edfb7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
