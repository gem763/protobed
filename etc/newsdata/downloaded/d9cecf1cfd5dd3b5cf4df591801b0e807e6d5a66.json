There was a large number of officers and she was still grieving; Lord Brittan having died only weeks earlier.\n\nAt the same time Lord Bramall's (pictured in July 2014) residence in Surrey and the home Harvey Proctor was given on the Belvoir estate where he worked as private secretary to the Duke of Rutland were both turned upside down\n\n'She was deeply shocked by the search. One particular event caused much distress. Officers searched through letters of condolence.'\n\nSir Richard finds the warrants were 'obtained unlawfully' when they were authorised by a detective inspector and applied for by a detective sergeant.\n\nThe application said Beech's accusations of the fictitious crimes had 'remained consistent' despite multiple statements not quite adding up.\n\nSir Richard said: 'Throughout the day Lord Bramall asked questions in an endeavour to ascertain the nature of the allegations.\n\n'He wishes to know what the magistrate had been told in order to grant the warrant but was not told.'\n\nHarvey Proctor, 72, said he only feels 'icy contempt' for Carl Beech - who said he was directly involved in two murders and multiple counts of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s.
