We\u2019re pushing in the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done the job yet but we\u2019re one step closer.\u201d", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 The rules governing the haka, and a new nickname for England\u2019s \u201ckamikaze kids\u201d: here are five things we", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/7cf7dc_eddie-jones-had-laugh-steve-hansen-tackling-haka-super-maro-england-win-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
