The resolution accused the organization of inciting gun violence and arming those who carry out domestic terrorist attacks in the country.\n\n\u201cAll countries have violent and hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines thanks, in large part, to the National Rifle Association\u2019s influence,\u201d the resolution read, citing gun violence statistics including that about 100 people in the U.S. are killed with guns every day while hundreds more are wounded.\n\nSan Francisco also called on other cities, states and the federal government to join the city in designating the group as a domestic terrorist organization. The resolution\u2019s passage came after a wave of mass shootings in Gilroy, California; El Paso, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and Odessa, Texas.\n\nSupervisor Catherine Stefani introduced the measure July 30 after the deadly mass shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, which left three dead and 17 injured, not including the shooter, who killed himself. Stefani is named individually and in her own capacity in the lawsuit. She did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAmid the list of lawsuits, the NRA is also facing collapse from within due to financial mismanagement. Six NRA board members have resigned from the gun group just this year.", "description": "The National Rifle Association's lawsuit says San Francisco's new resolution is unconstitutional.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d770b2b3b00002a74d0c40e.jpeg?cache=vghz4z2rwq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
