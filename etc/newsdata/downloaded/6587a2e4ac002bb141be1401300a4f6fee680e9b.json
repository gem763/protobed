Uber, in particular, has been criticized for avoiding traditional transportation and labor regulations by labeling itself a technology company, drawing scrutiny from federal prosecutors and officials in cities such as San Francisco and London.\n\nUber and Lyft declined to send representatives to testify at the hearing after the companies \u201cled us on for six to eight weeks that they would testify,\u201d DeFazio said. In a statement on Thursday Lyft said the panel first contacted it about the hearing on Sept. 30.\n\nThe hearing should serve as \u201ca wake-up call to the companies that have flooded our roadways with disruptive technologies and investor capital that their days of operating with little public policy and regulatory oversight in the transportation space are coming to an end,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\n(Adds Lyft comment in fourth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Beene in Washington at rbeene@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Gregory Mott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. may soon face stepped-up oversight after largely avoiding traditional rules during their rapid expansion in recent years, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said on Wednesday.Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon", "authors": ["Ryan Beene"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5SE5n7u9JtVm7qMxbzW22g--~B/aD0xMzMxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/80730dd372785e4567cf190f18d34de1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
