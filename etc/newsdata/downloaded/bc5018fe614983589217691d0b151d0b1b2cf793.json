Partisanship fades.", "language": "en", "text": "Dear reader:\n\n\u201cThe country is not as divided as the media make it seem.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a quote from a participant in a recent election survey experiment called \u201cAmerica in One Room.\u201d As the name indicates, the project brought together a representative sample of voters from around the country, reflecting the nation\u2019s deep divides on partisanship, ideology, and identity. Over the course of a long weekend in Dallas, they held small-group discussions on five hot-button topics: immigration, healthcare, the environment, the economy, and foreign policy.\n\nMany participants experienced significant shifts in thought. \u201cRepublicans became more welcoming of immigration and less punitive in their attitudes,\u201d the researchers write in The New York Times. Support for making undocumented immigrants return to their home countries, for example, fell from 45 to 25 percent. Democrats shifted notably on economic issues \u2013 support for a federal minimum wage dropped by 23 percentage points.\n\nThe conversations also had a marked effect on people\u2019s confidence in our democratic institutions: The percentage who said America\u2019s system of democracy was \u201cworking well\u201d rose from 30 percent to 60 percent.\n\nMany groups have undertaken similar efforts in recent years, anecdotally confirming what \u201cAmerica in One Room\u201d was able to measure: When you bring people of opposing views together for thoughtful discussions, the nation\u2019s partisan divide shrinks.\n\nThe challenge, of course, lies in the \u201cbringing together\u201d part. Partisanship is now correlated with geography \u2013 Democrats are clustered in cities (and, increasingly, suburbs); Republicans dominate in exurban and rural areas. The lack of regular contact between Democrats and Republicans has led to a decrease in understanding. But overcoming a geographic divide is easier said than done.\n\n\n\nAnd while physical distance isn\u2019t an issue in virtual communities, those spaces are increasingly segregated as well. The participants in Dallas were given a 55-page handbook with arguments for and against each policy proposal. Most voters today get their information in a piecemeal fashion from media sources or peers that simply reinforce previously held views.\n\nStill, the \u201cAmerica in One Room\u201d researchers highlight their project\u2019s value as a measure of public opinion \u2013 revealing Americans\u2019 \u201cconsidered judgments\u201d following discussion and deliberation, rather than the \u201csurface impressions\u201d most polling reflects.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting how many times people agreed at the heart of an issue, but just had slight differences in how to go about making needed changes,\u201d participant Joan Young told CNN. \"I was very hopeful after seeing the way our small group behaved.\u201d\n\nLet us know what you\u2019re thinking at csmpolitics@csmonitor.com.\n\nRead this story at csmonitor.com\n\nBecome a part of the Monitor community", "description": "\u2018America in One Room\u2019 polled voters before and after discussions and briefings.
