In the clip, viewable below, an unidentified man approaches Eli on a staircase of a Manhattan subway station and demands he remove his pink yarmulke.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re desecrating the name of God,\u201d the man, who has not been publicly identified, shouts at Eli as he exits the station. \u201cAny man that lays with another man is an abomination. You\u2019ll be murdered for it! Take the kippah off!\u201d\n\nTHREAD: Trigger Warning: violent speech, harassment. I got harassed, followed and threatened on the street today. Someone was upset that I was wearing a pink kippah, carrying a purse and had a pride patch sewn onto my jeans. I am sharing the encounter for three reasons. pic.twitter.com/Y9HWiX2nSs \u2014 Adam Eli (@aewerner) September 9, 2019\n\nAs the clip progresses, the man grows increasingly agitated toward Eli, who also carried a pink purse and wore jeans emblazoned with a rainbow patch at the time of the incident.\n\n\u201cStay in the closet,\u201d the unidentified man demands after reciting parts of the Book of Leviticus. \u201cMake sure your closet is in another closet ... this is not Judaism!\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the video had been viewed more than 740,000 times. It also caught the eye of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who shared Eli\u2019s original tweet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no place for hate in this city,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt takes courage to confront homophobia and tell a story like this.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through this, Adam. But we\u2019re proud of how you responded.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no place for hate in this city. https://t.co/9SqgfRQhJd \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) September 10, 2019\n\nA writer and activist, Eli is a known figure in the global LGBTQ community as the founder of Voices 4, an advocacy group aimed at magnifying the voices of queer people around the world through social media. He initially founded the group in 2017 in response to the alleged persecution of gay men in the Russian republic of Chechnya.\n\nThe 28-year-old did not file a police report regarding the incident. In a series of Monday tweets, however, he said he felt compelled to share video of the confrontation as a reminder that the struggle for LGBTQ rights isn\u2019t over.\n\n2. This is a fraction of what our trans + GNC family get every single day. In this moment I was able to stand up to my attacker NOT bc I'm brave but bc I'm a white resourced man in a heavily trafficked place. We know what happens when a white man attacks a black trans women. \u2014 Adam Eli (@aewerner) September 9, 2019\n\n3. cont Racism, transphobia, xenophobia, islamophobia, anti semitism and ableism hold hands. Our ancestors taught us none of us are safe until all of us are safe. Queer culture is not going to Equinox and getting brunch. Queer culture is about fighting for ur community \u2014 Adam Eli (@aewerner) September 9, 2019\n\nIn an interview with New York television station Pix 11, he said that he\u2019d like the video to draw attention to to the ongoing epidemic of violence against transgender people, particularly women of color, across the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cisgender, white ... I have resources and that\u2019s the type of violence that I\u2019m getting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the type of violence that one of the most privileged members of our community is getting, can you imagine what it\u2019s like every day in the subway to be a trans person or a gender non-conforming person or a queer person of color?\u201d", "description": "Adam Eli hopes the video will help people take action against violence targeting LGBTQ communities.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77a2b6240000122777ca1a.png?cache=3nvxj2brxe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
