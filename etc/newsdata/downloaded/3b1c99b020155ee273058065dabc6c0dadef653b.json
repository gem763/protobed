It was great to win in front of our fans.\"\n\nDavis finished with 21 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and five blocks, with his defensive efforts particularly impressive.\n\nHe added: \"We took it to them. We were the aggressors - especially on the defensive end. To be able to hold a team like that to 86 points...\"\n\nDiscussing his deployment at the five, Davis said: \"If it makes sense, then obviously I don't mind doing it. And it made sense.\n\n\"But the coach is very smart - we're going to pick and choose when he wants me to play the five. It might not be all game. It was just the second half, or really just the third quarter.\n\n\"We were able to accomplish some great things out of it. Any time we can do that and it helps the team, I'm all for it.\"\n\nLeBron James also highlighted the need for the Lakers to be strong defensively, while he suggested the Clippers' big win over the Golden State Warriors shed new light on a comparatively narrow opening defeat.\n\n\"That's who we are. That's our defensive staple,\" said James, who weighed in with 32 points, seven rebounds, 10 assists and a steal. \"We want to be that every single night, being able to hold teams to underneath their averages.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We thought we did a poor job against the Clippers in the opener - they had 112 - and then they end up with 140-something [141 against the Warriors].\n\n\"We want to continue to get better and better with our defensive strategies and our gameplan and to just execute that.\"", "description": "The Los Angeles Lakers turned in an improved showing against the Utah Jazz, encouraging Anthony Davis and LeBron James.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6vd.MK_6yUo1x6iIhvNVPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9X8HSOJp5SuTJGQ8D6OSEg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/f3fdd008648abd50b86f3b2a6ad9d627", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
