REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Monday they had charged a climate-change activist who last week attempted to disrupt Europe\u2019s biggest airport, London Heathrow.\n\nThe \u2018Heathrow Pause\u2019 activists had hoped to bring Heathrow to a standstill on Friday by flying drones but struggled to get them off the ground due to signal jamming, and the airport said it remained fully operational.\n\nRoger Hallam, a co-founder of the Extinction Rebellion group which blocked streets in central London this year, was charged with attempting to cause a public nuisance, London\u2019s Metropolitan police said in a statement.\n\nThe 53-year-old was arrested on Thursday and Saturday, and appeared in court on Monday. He was remanded in custody until Oct. 14, when he will return to court.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said 19 other people were arrested in connection with the protest and had been bailed or released under investigation.\n\nHeathrow Pause, a splinter group of Extinction Rebellion, had planned to fly the drones no higher than head height in a bid to put pressure on the government to take tougher steps to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAhead of his arrest, Hallam said in a statement the \u201cconsequence of not rebelling is indescribable suffering and death for billions of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequence of rebellion is a chance to avoid the worst. Rebellion means mass economic disruption and deep personal sacrifice. I am a rebel,\u201d he said.", "description": "British police said on Monday they had charged a climate-change activist who last week attempted to disrupt Europe's biggest airport, London Heathrow.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430540196&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1C3", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
