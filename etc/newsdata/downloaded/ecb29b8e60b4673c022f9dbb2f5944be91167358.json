You\u2019re sure to be treated like a pariah.\n\nOne veteran professor who has experienced the intolerance of leftists in power is University of Tulsa\u2019s Jacob Howland. He opposes the new president\u2019s \u201cTrue Commitment\u201d plan that guts the university\u2019s liberal arts curriculum and brings in more of the typical \u201cdiversity\u201d stuff. For having opposed those changes, he now has a target on his back and writes about his unhappy experiences in today\u2019s Martin Center article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has been harassed by the administration over claimed \u201cethics violations\u201d and student journalists have been intimidated for writing critically about the events at their school.\n\n\u201cWhat is so disturbing about all of this,\u201d Howland writes, \u201cis the way supposedly liberal academics can turn into intimidating bullies once they\u2019ve adopted transformational plans like True Commitment.
