But it was a controversial idea and did not stop the company going under.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nSo why have so many firms gone bust in recent months and years? The reasons are varied but analysts mostly agree on what the issues are. Alex Dickson, head of research at auto-switching service Switchcraft, says it is now \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d in retail energy markets.\n\n\u201cA combination of the lower price cap, Brexit, and winter pricing is beckoning the perfect storm in retail energy this autumn; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if five or six more suppliers went down by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nMark Todd, co-founder of energy comparison website energyhelpline, agrees there could be more casualties before the end of the year.\n\nHe says: \u201cSuppliers are being squeezed by high wholesale prices, the price cap and other unexpected costs. With the energy price cap falling by \u00a375 per year for customers from 1 October on, this could have been the final nail in the coffin for yet another small supplier.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, customers also have high expectations when it comes to service and the market competition is forcing more and more suppliers to step up their game ... more may follow this year.\u201d\n\nThis may be worrying for customers but the good news is that there are extensive protections in place.\n\nSo what happens if my supplier goes under?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be cut off and you will not lose any money held in your account. That is the most important thing to remember, otherwise we would all have to constantly monitor the financial security of our providers and few people would risk switching to a newcomer.\n\nInstead, when a supplier goes under, there is an Ofgem safety net that kicks in to ensure no one\u2019s supply is cut off. Nothing will change immediately.\n\nAnd if you have a balance on your account and are worried about your money then don\u2019t, that is also protected.\n\nOfgem will move affected customers to a new supplier and there will be no disruption. It does not just pick any supplier, it asks them to bid for the customers in an attempt to get the best possible deal.\n\nDuring this time, Ofgem advises not switching energy providers yourself until the supplier it appoints has contacted you. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a few days and will make the process as hassle-free as possible, including getting any outstanding balance returned.\n\nIf you do decide to switch away from the Ofgem-appointed energy firm then there won\u2019t be any exit fees, so you won\u2019t be locked into any deal you didn\u2019t choose.\n\nHowever, it is a good idea to take a meter reading as soon as you hear your supplier has gone bust.\n\nWho pays for this?\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring for billpayers to know that their supply and balances are protected, and that Ofgem will oversee the switch to a new supplier.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not without cost. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, says we are all paying for these failures: \u201cWhen a supplier goes bust, customer credit balances are protected. But all of us will eventually pay for honouring them through increased bills.\n\n\u201cThese regulations provide vital protection for those affected. However, it was never expected that firms would actively encourage very large credit balances.\n\n\u201cOfgem needs to act to reduce the cost of supplier failures and protect customers.\u201d\n\nThere is some good news. Ofgem has already taken some action \u2013 from June this year companies that apply for a licence to supply energy are put through far more stringent tests to prove they can adequately fund their business for at least a year.\n\nWhen the new rules came into force, Mary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: \u201cIn an ever-evolving market, Ofgem\u2019s objective is to protect consumers while also ensuring they enjoy the benefits of increased competition and innovation that successful new firms entering the market bring.\n\n\u201cApplying new requirements on suppliers entering and operating in the market will aid us to weed out those that are underprepared, under-resourced and unfit. This will help minimise the risk of supplier failure and help drive up standards for consumers.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the new standards will ensure that customers can keep benefitting from increased competition while also slowing the number going under.\n\nIn the meantime, 2019 may end up being a terrible year for yet more challenger energy firms.", "description": "The collapse of\u00a0Eversmart\u00a0last week brings the number of energy firms to have gone bust in 2019 to five, along with Solarplicity, Brilliant Energy, Our Power and Economy Energy.
