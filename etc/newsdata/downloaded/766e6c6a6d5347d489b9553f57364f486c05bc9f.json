The , which measures the greenback against a basket of developed-market currencies, was down 0.1% at 98.680.\n\nPowell had said that the Fed will soon start expanding its balance sheet again. He took pains to stress that this was not the resumption of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, but rather a technical exercise in ensuring that the financial system has enough liquidity to function.\n\nThat suggests that the Fed will limit itself to buying short-dated assets, avoiding any attempt to intervene directly in price formation for longer maturities. By contrast, the European Central Bank recently committed to resuming purchases of 20 billion euros of government bonds a month, and is likely to spread those out all along the yield curve in an attempt to depress all euro maturity rates.\n\nSeparately, Powell noted that he hadn\u2019t ruled out another interest rate cut this year, but stressed that the Fed would be data-led. Analysts say that points increasingly to lower U.S. rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cIt does look as if the US economy is losing momentum,\u201d said ING chief economist for Asia-Pacific Robert Carnell. \u201cOur house forecast of an October rate cut followed by a further cut in December looks highly plausible given the recent run of data. It would get a further boost if trade talks come to nothing.\u201d\n\nTrade talks between the U.S. and China are due to resume on Thursday, but hopes of a breakthrough have receded dramatically as the U.S. has taken a string of punitive measures focusing not on China\u2019s trade practises but its human rights record, an area where it is politically much harder for Beijing to give ground.\n\nElsewhere, the British pound was bumping along the lower end of a new range after falling on Tuesday to a one-month low on the latest twist in the Brexit negotiations. The near-breakdown of talks amid increasingly bitter exchanges between London and other European capitals ought logically to increase the risk of a disorderly \u201cNo-Deal Brexit\u201d.\n\nBy 0800 GMT, was at $1.2228, up a little from late Thursday. It was down against the however at 1.1137, just off the one-month low it hit on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, given that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signalled he will ask for an extension of the Oct. 31 deadline, as required by U.K. law, if he doesn\u2019t get a deal at next week\u2019s summit, the market is still reluctant to price in the worst-case scenario.", "description": "Forex - Dollar Mixed as Market Digests Powell Speech", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC4P1JB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
