Elizabeth Warren takes the stage before addressing supporters at a rally in Washington Square Park on Monday (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nBATTLE OF THE PROGRESSIVE STARS: In the fight to be the left's standard-bearer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) just scored a big win over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nThe Working Families Party, an influential progressive group with deep ties to labor unions that backed Sanders for president in 2016, is now throwing its chips all in for the Massachusetts Democrat as the best hope to defeat former vice president Joe Biden in the primary \u2014 and President Trump in the general election.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately believe that Sen. Warren will be the nominee,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, the group's national director, told Power Up.\n\nThe endorsement, first reported by the New York Times, is yet another sign of Warren's ascendancy over Sanders. And it happened on a particularly strong day for Warren: She rallied a huge crowd of 20,000 people in Washington Square Park in New York City and unveiled her plan to address corruption in Washington by limiting \u201cthe influence of federal lawmakers and lobbyists while also expanding protections for workers,\u201d per my colleague Amy Wang.\n\nMitchell, who also introduced Warren at her rally last night, said the early endorsement was meant to give her a boost to surpass Biden, whom he denounced as beholden to corporate interests: \u201cWarren's steady rise is an example of a really disciplined operation that she's built around her, and the fact that she's running her campaign in a way where she is putting real meaningful policy substance ahead that speaks to the fundamental structures of our economy and democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarren's steady rise is an example of a really disciplined operation that she's built around her, and the fact that she's running her campaign in a way where she is putting real meaningful policy substance ahead that speaks to the fundamental structures of our economy and democracy.\u201d Mitchell argued that she has broad appeal with Democrats, beyond the left flank: \u201cShe is able to articulate that in common sense ways. It's working and it's working with a lot of different audiences \u2014 her campaign is attracting a lot of folks who are part of the progressive wing, a lot of folks who have not been political observers but are now fighting for something they believe in.\u201d\n\nDuring her speech last night, Warren compared herself to a crusader for worker's rights: Frances Perkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's labor secretary and the first female member of the U.S. Cabinet. Her focus on female-led organizing seemed designed to quell skepticism from some Democrats over her electability due to her gender and criticism that her liberal message is too polarizing for a general election.\n\n\u201cThe speech also highlighted Warren\u2019s theory of change,\u201d according to Time Magazine's Charlotte Alter: \u201cWhile the women of the trade unions kept pushing from the outside, Frances pushed from the inside,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSo, what did one woman \u2014 one very persistent woman \u2014 backed up by millions of people across this country get done?\u201d she said. \u201cSocial Security. Unemployment insurance. Abolition of child labor. Minimum wage. The right to join a union. Even the very existence of the weekend. Big, structural change. One woman, and millions of people to back her up.\u201d\n\n.@ewarren camp says at least 20,000 people attended her rally in Washington Square Park tonight.\n\n\n\n(They got 23K rsvps, an aide says, and stopped counting attendees at 20K once Warren began speaking.)\n\n\n\nThis is her biggest event yet, following a Seattle rally that drew 15,000. pic.twitter.com/Exj6CsxKlA \u2014 Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) September 17, 2019\n\nWhy it matters: The backing of the Working Families Party, whose influence has expanded since 2016, could drive other progressives to make a choice between the two ideologically similar candidates as the historically crowded field winnows. With organizing chapters in over 15 states, candidates WFP has supported have gone on to win races across the country at the congressional, state and local level. Considering Sanders in 2016 called the group \u201cthe closest thing there is to a political party that believes in my vision of democratic socialism,\u201d the switch-over could make a big impact on the base.\n\nMoving on: \u201cWe were tremendously proud to endorse Sanders in 2016 and a critical section of our base voted for him, and we have nothing but positive things to say about him and his activists,\u201d Mitchell told us, declining to criticize Sanders several times. But now, Mitchell says the group's \"North Star\u201d is \"making sure that Warren's the nominee and beats Trump.\u201d\n\nIncoming from Sanders camp: Some of his backers reacted to Warren's win poorly \u2014 even going so far as to accuse WFP leadership of putting its fingers on the scales of the group's ranked-choice voting system. Mitchell denied these charges. \"We understand that we have many friends and partners that are disappointed but we're going to continue to struggle with them on many of the issues we all believe in,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders's campaign manager tamped down the drama: \u201cWe look forward to working with the Working Families Party and other allies to defeat Donald Trump. Together, we\u2019ll build a movement across the country to transform our economy to finally work for the working class of this country,\u201d his campaign manager Faiz Shakir said, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut there's this from Sanders's Iowa state director:\n\nThere is one movement politics presidential candidate. One. It's @BernieSanders.\n\n\n\nthat's all. that's the entire tweet. #Bernie2020 \u2014 Misty Rebik (@mistyrebik) September 16, 2019\n\nWFP endorsement is also a reflection of the left's strategic maneuvering against Biden: The former Obama veep often touts his record as a \u201cUnion man.\u201d But Mitchell, who was previously an organizing leader for Black Lives Matter, said that the group's endorsement of Warren \u201cis a bit of a myth buster\u201d that Biden is the labor union candidate.\n\nMitchell, who slammed Biden as a centrist and product of \u201ccorporate politics,\u201d described Biden's performance on the debate stage last week as a crystallizing contrast to Warren: \u201cWhat I heard was marginal solutions. What I heard was a lack of clarity. What I heard was hearkening to a mythologized caste during the Obama administration \u2014 and I think what people are hungry for is a bold progressive future and crystal clarity around policy. And that details matter,\u201d according to Mitchell.\n\n\u201cWhat I heard was marginal solutions. What I heard was a lack of clarity.

And that details matter,\u201d according to Mitchell. Biden also drew criticism recently from a labor union in his own backyard: \u201c He always calls himself a Pennsylvanian at heart. His headquarters are here in Philadelphia. But his folks haven't found the importance of coming together and talking to our workers. And so that's very disappointing,\u201d AFL-CIO Philadelphia Council President Pat Eiding told NPR's Scott Detrow last month. \u201cThere's got to be some respect for the working people, if they want their vote.\u201d\n\nHe always calls himself a Pennsylvanian at heart.

They cited Warren's plan to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal. During the debates last week, Warren repeatedly dodged questions about whether she will raise taxes on middle class families to pay for the program.\n\nThe end of Warren's selfie line after last night's huge NYC rally:\n\n11:38pm - @ewarren is done and the last picture has been taken.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nAt The White House\n\nUNCERTAINTY ON IRAN: Trump said that it appears Iran is responsible for the weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities that Kingdom officials say forced them to cut production by 50 percent, but stopped short of making a final conclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s looking that way,\" Trump said of Tehran's involvement, but added: \u201cThat\u2019s being checked out right now.\u201d\n\nAllies also holding off: Trump\u2019s reticence to publicly blame Iran was shared by America\u2019s British and German allies on Monday. China and Russia also cautioned against naming a culprit. \u201cFor their part, Saudi officials affirmed that Iranian weapons were used in the attack but also stopped short of singling out Iran in statements that appeared to reflect fears across the Persian Gulf of a wider and more violent conflagration,\u201d our colleagues Shane Harris, Erin Cunningham and Kareem Fahim report.\n\nThe big question is: What happens next? \u201cTrump told reporters \u2018we don\u2019t want war with anybody\u2019 and then less than an hour later said he thinks a U.S. military strike on an Iranian oil facility would be a proportional response,\u201d our colleague Anne Gearan reports.\n\nThe politics: \u201cTrump is caught between a political imperative to confront Iran \u2014 pleasing hawkish Republican supporters and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 and his own political instincts against foreign intervention and toward cutting a deal,\u201d Anne writes.\n\n\u201cTrump is caught between a political imperative to confront Iran \u2014 pleasing hawkish Republican supporters and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 and his own political instincts against foreign intervention and toward cutting a deal,\u201d Anne writes.

They also said that, if such a move was deemed necessary, the administration would need to find a valid legal basis to take action.\u201d\n\nForecast for next week:\n\nBREAKING: Ahead of UN meeting, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says 'there will be no talks with the US at any level.' \u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) September 17, 2019\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in 2018.
