The tie-up marks the first time in Australia a Land Registry office has teamed up with a private sector company to distribute products. They will become available through the Land Services SA platform, SAILIS, from mid-November.\n\nBrenton Pike, chief executive of Land Services SA, said the partnership with PointData was one of the ways the entity was ''creating value for our communities and unlocking our wealth of data''.\n\nPointData has set up offices in Sydney and Melbourne as part of a national expansion.\n\n\"Our strategy is to have national coverage by the second half of next year,'' Mr Giannakodakis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group had been steadily using machine learning to build up its Sydney database and had found that some of the old adages of real estate had been reinforced in the house price downturn.\n\n\"It's the land that goes up and down in value in terms of market forces,'' he said.\n\nPointData is able to undertake instant property feasibility studies and had a high degree of accuracy in property valuations to the point where it can pinpoint fluctuating shifts in particular streets in suburbs.\n\nMr Giannakodakis said at its most basic level the technology platform was able to predict whether a property was worth buying.\n\nThe company, which changed its name from ipData two months ago, is chaired by former KPMG partner Con Tragakis.\n\nMr Tragakis said PointData was a disrupter delivering greater levels of accuracy to back decision-making by investors and financiers.", "description": "Property tech firm PointData says big banks are likely to embrace automated valuation models when assessing loan applications to offset shrinking margins.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9f50827a7dbf834243b0d7d09003fe7bd242ed7a", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
