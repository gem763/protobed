Raking the infield during the seventh inning stretch? Handling the fireworks display when the Nationals finally advance in the postseason for the first time in franchise history?\n\nThe Washington Nationals who, matched up against the heavily favored Los Angeles Dodgers, are embracing a \u201cWhatever The Heck It Takes To Win\u2019\u2019 approach.\n\nThat approach was on display again Friday night when the Nationals beat the Los Dodgers 4-2 and evened the best-of-five series at one game apiece.\n\nStrasburg, two days after throwing three innings of relief in the Nationals\u2019 wild-card game, pitched six stellar innings, striking out 10 and allowing just one run. Then Scherzer, who started the wild-card game and was scheduled to start Game 3 Sunday, pitched the eighth inning.\n\nScherzer mowed down the Dodgers, striking out Joc Pederson, Chris Taylor and Gavin Lux, with his fastball topping out at 99 mph.\n\nYes, the use of Scherzer caught Dodgers manager Dave Roberts by surprise. And he looked a little glassy-eyed after watching his team strike out 17 times \u2013 with Strasburg and Scherzer combining for 13 of those.\n\n\u201cObviously when you deploy Scherzer in Game 2, they're going to play every game to the end and use whatever part of the roster they have,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said. \u201cThey trust their starters. They're going to rely on their starters.\u2019\u2019\n\nMax Scherzer tossed a scoreless inning in relief on Friday. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWith the Nationals probably going as far as Strasburg can take them, it conjures up memories of the days when the Milwaukee Braves leaned on starting pitchers Warren Spahn and Johnny Sain, inspiring this poem:\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll use Spahn, Then we\u2019ll use Sain, Then an off day, Followed by rain.\n\nBack will come Spahn , Followed by Sain , And followed, We Hope, By two days of rain.\n\nThe weather forecast doesn\u2019t look helpful for the Nationals, but they might not need help from Mother Nature based on how they won the wild-card game and Game 2 of the National League Division Series.\n\nIt hinged largely on buy-in from Strasburg, who until Friday had never pitched on short rest in the majors.\n\n\u201cI'm very routine-oriented and I would say my younger self would be a little bit alarmed by it,\u2019\u2019 Strasburg said. \u201cBut now it's kind of, at this point in my career, it\u2019s\u2026 just another challenge.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt is the ultimate challenge, tasked with beating a Dodgers team that won a franchise-record 106 games and has reached the past two World Series.\n\nCould Scherzer start Game 4 (with Anibal Sanchez starting Game 3 and Patrick Corbin, the Game 1 starter, coming out of the bullpen for Game 3) and Strasburg start Game 5?\n\n\u201cYeah, it's a good possibility,\u2019\u2019 Martinez said of that scenario. \u201cI mean I'm going to sit back tonight and think about a bunch of different things and wake up tomorrow and get on a plane and think about a bunch of different things and then we'll be ready to go.\u2019\u2019\n\nTurns out this plan was not hatched in desperation or a sudden burst of creativity, but rather conversations with Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo that took place a while back.\n\n\u201cYou know, before the series started, before we even got to the playoffs, our game plan was to try to utilize these guys the best way possible without disrupting their starts,\u2019\u2019 Martinez said. \u201cAnd we talked to all of them and they have all been on board. \u2026\n\n\u201cEvery day's crucial. We had a chance to win today. And I told Max, if the game's close then we'll use you. And we did that.\u2019\u2019\n\nBecause that\u2019s what it took.", "description": "The Nationals took Game 2 of the NLDS on Friday, using three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer out of the bullpen in the eighth inning.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published A.M.
