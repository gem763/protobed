She was questioning the basic fairness of the election, she stressed, not necessarily the outcome.\n\nSo why are Democratic presidential candidates still not only questioning the outcome but insisting forthrightly that she won?\n\nIt *is* possible to do a stump speech about voter suppression without name-checking Abrams.\n\nA man from Georgia asked me what I will do about voting rights. That\u2019s because, were it not for voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be governor right now. We need a New Voting Rights Act, so every voice is heard and every vote is counted. pic.twitter.com/miXl7Xkq2n \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 6, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Beto:\n\nHere's your Friday reminder that if the GA Secretary of State hadn\u2019t been allowed to hold back 53,000 voter registrations, Stacey Abrams would be the Governor of Georgia right now. We have to stop the discrimination at the ballot box and restore the Voting Rights Act! \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) September 6, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to see them doing this after a week of Trump proving anew that he can\u2019t admit failure in even the tiniest dispute, let alone something like a national election. It\u2019s beyond question that he\u2019ll claim he was cheated next year if he loses regardless of how steep the margin of defeat is. Why would Democrats complicate their post-election messaging that he\u2019s a sore loser and a reality-denying crank by handing him and his team this tu-quoque ammunition? Do Beto or Klobuchar really think they\u2019re in line for the Stacey Abrams endorsement if the field narrows to one of them versus a true-blue progressive like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren?\n\nWe may yet see a decline in the \u201cStacey wuz robbed\u201d line in stump speeches, not because the imperative to signal concern about voting rights has diminished but because Abrams\u2019s own standing in the party may have slipped a little. I knew people would hold it against her that she\u2019s not trying to win one of Georgia\u2019s two open Senate seats next year:\n\nThere\u2019s still some hope that Bullock and O\u2019Rourke, despite their disavowals of interest, will run for the Senate after they scratch their presidential itches. The case of Abrams is more perplexing. She has said it would be \u201carrogant\u201d to think she\u2019s the only Democrat who could win a Senate seat in Georgia. Yet it appears she\u2019s holding out for a vice-presidential nomination. \u201cI would be honored,\u201d she told WBUR\u2019s \u201cOn Point\u201d on Tuesday. With the retirement of the ailing Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), both Georgia Senate seats will be on the ballot next year. And the Democrats\u2019 best candidate won\u2019t run for either? That\u2019s a gift to Trump\u2019s enablers. Why? For the \u201chonor\u201d of a vice- presidential nomination? Preserving herself for another office, another time? I hope Abrams reconsiders. History won\u2019t be kind to those who stepped aside in democracy\u2019s time of need.\n\nIf Democrats lose one or both of those seats narrowly with lesser-known nominees, the party will remember. Imagine Trump getting a SCOTUS nominee confirmed in his second term on a 50/50 vote with Pence as the tiebreaker and both of Georgia\u2019s Republican senators in the majority. Abrams could have blocked him if she\u2019d run and won!\n\nAnyway, back to the question in the headline. Has any Democrat in elected office anywhere in the country dared to offer the opinion that they\u2019re skeptical that Abrams \u201creally won\u201d last year? How about the more politic opinion that they\u2019re agnostic about the outcome of the Georgia race but that it\u2019s irrelevant to the question of whether Democrats need to be extra vigilant about voter suppression next year? There are all sorts of ways to signal support for the underlying issue of counting every vote without embracing the Trumpish belief that she personally lost due to cheating. Anyone know of any Dems \u2014 at any level \u2014 who have voiced that opinion? I\u2019m curious; if you can think of someone, let me know and I\u2019ll update. In lieu of an exit question, here\u2019s a reminder that Klobuchar has somehow managed to win three Senate elections in Minnesota, each by 20 points or more, despite delivering laugh lines as though she\u2019s brain damaged.", "description": "Denial.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
