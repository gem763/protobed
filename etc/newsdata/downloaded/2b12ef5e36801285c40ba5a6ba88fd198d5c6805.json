REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, seeks to transform the practice of U.S. government officials cashing in by moving to private-sector jobs where they make vastly more money by influencing regulations and legislation.\n\nIn a detailed policy plan, Warren one of the top contenders among 20 Democrats seeking their party\u2019s nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, proposes barring elected officials and senior government appointees from ever becoming lobbyists.\n\nShe would also ban U.S. firms lobbying on behalf of foreign governments, expand the definition of lobbyists to include anyone paid to influence lawmakers, impose new taxes on excessive lobbying by large companies and restrict the ability of industry officials to \u201cdominate\u201d the regulatory process.\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m announcing a comprehensive set of far-reaching and aggressive proposals to root out corruption in Washington,\u201d Warren said in her plan.\n\nShe added that \u201ccomprehensive anti-corruption reforms targeted at Washington itself are necessary to finally end the stranglehold that the wealthy and the well-connected have over our government\u2019s decision making processes.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics said in January that companies and others spent $3.42 billion on lobbying in 2018, the highest amount in eight years.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan takes aim at Trump, a real estate developer who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs. She would require presidents and vice presidents to place business assets in a blind trust to be sold and require other senior officials to divest assets that could present conflicts.\n\nTrump maintains ownership of his businesses but has ceded day-to-day control to his sons. Last week, Trump said that before November 2020, he would release an \u201cextremely complete\u201d financial report.\n\nWarren noted that T-Mobile US Inc, which won Justice Department approval to merge with Sprint Corp in July, \u201csent its top executives to the Trump Hotel in DC right after the company announced a merger.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court revived a lawsuit alleging that Trump violated the U.S. Constitution by profiting from foreign and domestic officials who patronized his properties. Trump denies the allegations.\n\nWarren wants to ban lobbyists from all fundraising activities including hosting events or serving as campaign bundlers, bar senior officials and Congress from trading individual stocks and pay congressional staff \u201ccompetitive\u201d salaries with the private sector. She would bar all federal employees from becoming corporate lobbyists for six years after leaving government.\n\nShe would also prohibit courts from using sealed settlements to conceal evidence in cases involving public health or safety and allow the public to sue federal agencies to enforce rules.\n\nWarren cited General Motors Co\u2019s decision more than a decade ago to settle some cases involving deadly ignition switch defects on the condition the terms remain confidential.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on Monday proposed a major rewrite of U.S. laws governing lobbying that she said was aimed at restricting corporate influence and rooting out \"corruption in Washington.\"", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430441710&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0TV", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
