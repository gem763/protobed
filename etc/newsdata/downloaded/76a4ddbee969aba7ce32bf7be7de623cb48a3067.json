Passing and handling far too scratchy (that was being kind, at times), and just too lotto-like in aerial contestation. To his credit, did spruce up his act considerably after the break.\n\nCheslin Kolbe: 6.5\n\nIn-form player policed carefully; space seldom opened up for the hot stepper on attack. But grafted like a trojan, often in places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and plentiful courage is required. More assured than Le Roux in the air, too.\n\nLukhanyo Am: 7\n\nPlayed a pleasingly assertive back-up role to midfield partner De Allende in defensive line speed and clever timing of his challenges. Prominent as a stealer on the deck. Guilty of one poor pass to Mapimpi, and sometimes got that wee bit too eager and impatient.\n\nDamian de Allende: 8\n\nHugely assertive and powerful at inside centre, where he made valuable yards and demonstrated the durability of his engine. But his aggressive defence and alertness in that department were also key features. Busied himself over the ball, as well. The occasional gremlin: like a knock-forward in contact and a penalty for obstructive running off the ball.\n\nMakazole Mapimpi: 7.5\n\nThe try-poacher extraordinaire: a further brace here took his career tally to 13 from 12 Tests, so a better than 100 percent strike rate. He is lethal even in limited space. Defence was willing and mostly watertight, too. Penalised once for silly tackle in air \u2026 though also should have earned one for getting a coat-hanger off the ground that referee Wayne Barnes oddly let go.\n\nHandre Pollard: 6.5\n\nYou can\u2019t really be a flyhalf \u201cgeneral\u201d when your No 9 is doing so much of the kicking from hand! But when he did get the chance, his tactical kicks were intelligent. Alert on defence, won an aerial contest well, and heavily involved in long-range Bok try late in game. Still a little erratic by his high standards off tee \u2026 needs to sharpen for semis.\n\nFaf de Klerk: 6.5\n\nCauses such divisive emotions over his playing style \u2026 much of it clearly under orders, of course. His frequent box-kicking all too seldom saw Boks win ball back. But his official choice as man of match, while highly debatable, would have been based on the good stuff: like his stamina, restless energy and speed/harrying on defence, a smart little steal at close quarters, and deft working of blindside to tee up first Mapimpi try.\n\nDuane Vermeulen: 7\n\nThe gnarly No 8 reminded that he was \u201caround\u201d with one or two thunderous tackles \u2026 including one that knocked wind right from sails of unsuspecting fullback Ryohei Yamanaka.\n\nPieter-Steph du Toit: 7\n\nClearly opponents doing their homework on his carrying threat; opportunities fairly limited at RWC thus far. Industrious and uncompromising elsewhere, and earned brilliant front-of-lineout steal deep in Bok quarter to spark breakout raid for try. Would have had one of his own, but for irksome Le Roux forward pass.\n\nSiya Kolisi: 7.5\n\nArguably the best Bok loosie, a welcome development. Tackle count well in the thirties, apparently, and some of them were really bruising. Best rugby came in Boks\u2019 broadly improved second half. One or two dubious options when in possession.\n\nLood de Jager: 7.5\n\nAnother tireless shift from the lanky customer. Made countless in-your-face tackles (especially in first half), stole a lineout ball, and was astute maul director from the fulcrum.\n\nEben Etzebeth: 6\n\nHasn\u2019t yet brought his most abrasive rugby to this World Cup, and that applied here. Dispossessed on one attacking drive, and conceded a penalty seconds after Boks had earned lineout poach. Pressured Japanese throw at front of lineout, however, and stole a ball or two.\n\nFrans Malherbe: 6.5\n\nHis right shoulder was influential at the scrum. Some drive-back tackles -- though missed one at close quarters -- and good support shoving in driving play.\n\nBongi Mbonambi: 6.5\n\nA clattering early tackle or two helped set tone for gradually-mounting Bok physical mastery. They will be hoping his leg injury shortly before break not too serious.\n\nTendai Mtawarira: 6\n\nVeteran was extremely fired-up \u2026 but it got better of him with reckless spear-tackle that earned him 10th-minute yellow card, leaving Boks under nasty pressure at time. Scrummed with intensity, though, and one massive turnover tackle on Michael Leitch.\n\nStandout substitute:\n\nMalcolm Marx: 7.5\n\nStrong statement by a player recently deposed as first-choice hooker. Got on just before halftime and was muscular, vigorous from that point onward. Lots of assertive tackles and cleanouts, and provided final pass off rumbling maul for De Klerk\u2019s try.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing</strong> differed from the official verdict in giving Damian de Allende the Boks\u2019 top rating from the RWC QF downing of Japan.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7951/619b5d2c11ce409c9059eb172b994a91.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
