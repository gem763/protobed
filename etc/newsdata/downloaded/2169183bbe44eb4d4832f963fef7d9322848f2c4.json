The center is now the world's largest panda conservation and research organization.\n\nTraditionally, visitors have not expected to see lots of pandas at the center. Wan Yongqing, a middle-aged panda fan from Beijing, said, \"Since my childhood, I have been told pandas are an endangered species.\"\n\nBut visitors are pleasantly surprised when they visit the center thanks to the painstaking work of its researchers to solve the three main problems in breeding pandas in captivity-the short estrus, mating and nursing.\n\nThrough their work, the center has rescued the animals from the brink of extinction and built up the number of captive pandas there from a mere 10 to 312.\n\nIt used to be difficult for captive pandas to become ruttish and mate, and producing viable offspring has always been somewhat of a challenge. But from 1992 to 2006, our researchers solved all three problems, Zhang said.\n\nWith the world's largest captive panda population, the center no longer catches wild pandas for research. Instead, it sends captive pandas into the wild, he said.\n\nSince 2006, the center has sent 11 captive pandas into the wild. Nine are still verifiably alive.\n\nTao Tao, then a 2-year-old male panda from the center, was released into the wild in the Liziping Nature Reserve in Sichuan in 2012. He was discovered in a tree a year later.\n\nAfter a veterinarian tranquilized him with a dart, a blood test showed the panda was in good health.\n\nTao Tao weighed 42 kilograms when he was released. When he was found a year later, he had gained at least 10 kg.", "description": "The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda now has more than 300 captive pandas for the first time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9be3ada310cf3e979ffed5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
