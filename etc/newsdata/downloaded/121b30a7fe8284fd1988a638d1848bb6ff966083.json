(Ben Jones)\n\nColumnist\n\nAs Gabriel Jones wound his way through the grounds of Fort Benning, Ga., he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the young man whose name was pinned to his back: Niall Coti-Sears.\n\nThis was six or seven years ago, when Gabriel was in middle school and running in the Soldier Marathon\u2019s 5K race, a fundraising event in his hometown of Columbus, Ga. Many entrants run in honor of a fallen soldier, sailor, airman or Marine they know. Others are given names at random. Gabriel got Niall\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI did the run and thought about him,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cAnd after the run, I looked him up to learn his history.\u201d\n\nHe found that Niall (pronounced \u201cNile\u201d) was a Marine lance corporal from the D.C. area who was killed in Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand province on June 23, 2012, two days after turning 23.\n\nGabriel found the Facebook page of Niall\u2019s mother, Susan Coti, and reached out to her. Would she tell him more about Niall? He learned that Niall loved music, had taken classes at the Levine School and enjoyed playing the piano and guitar and composing songs.\n\n\u201cI saw all the people he had affected, and I really wanted to do something,\u201d Gabriel said.\n\n\n\nBefore Niall Coti-Sears enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, he posed for Tysons Corner photographer Zaid Hamid. Zaid lost track of Niall but heard from his mother, Susan Coti, after the Marine was killed. (Zaid Hamid)\n\nHe decided to buy a commemorative paver with Niall\u2019s name on it to have installed at the National Infantry Museum & Soldier Center. He saved his allowance and held a bake sale at his middle school to raise money. When the brick was dedicated, he invited Susan to come to the ceremony and stay with his family.\n\nSusan brought some of Niall\u2019s music with her, including sheet music of a composition her son had written and recorded called \u201cDown By the C.\u201d The music had been transcribed for piano and flute by Amber Walson, a music teacher at the District\u2019s John Eaton Elementary, where Susan taught.\n\nAs their senior project at Columbus High, all the 12th-graders have to devote 50 hours to learning something they\u2019ve never done before. Gabriel knew what he wanted to do: He would learn to play the piano. Among the songs he would learn would be \u201cDown By the C.\u201d\n\nGabriel took piano lessons from a woman named Lulu Johnson. He approached a classmate named Tasya Diaz to ask if she would learn the flute part. When they\u2019d mastered it, they went to a studio called Bibb City Sound and recorded it. On June 21, 2019 \u2014 what would have been Niall\u2019s 30th birthday \u2014 they released it on iTunes and other services.\n\nOn the same day, Susan released a seven-track album with six songs Niall recorded and a song called \u201cNiall,\u201d co-written by his father, drummer Paul Sears, and recorded by the English band Karda Estra. It costs $10 to download on the website Play It Forward.\n\n\n\nGabriel Jones, an 18-year-old from Columbus, Ga., learned to play the piano to record a composition by Niall Coti-Sears, a U.S. Marine killed in Afghanistan in 2012. (Ben Jones)\n\nAs with Gabriel and Tasya\u2019s 99-cent recording, all the money goes to Gitameit, a music school in Myanmar, and Hungry for Music, a District-based charity that provides musical instruments to U.S. children who can\u2019t afford them.\n\nI asked Susan how she spent this past June 21, Niall\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cI spent the day thinking about him, listening to his music, loving him, missing him and being happy that I actually had 23 years with him,\u201d she said.\n\nGabriel never met the Marine whose name was pinned on his back, but he thinks about him often. What does he see?\n\n\u201cEvery time I try to visualize him, I kind of see this free spirit,\u201d said Gabriel, an 18-year-old freshman at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. \u201cAt the end of the day, it wasn\u2019t his place in life to be sitting at a desk doing monotonous work, but to be out there doing something \u2014 and doing something that mattered.\u201d\n\nNiall, Gabriel said, \u201cwas someone who wanted to get out there and change the world for the better.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something Gabriel hopes he can do.\n\nI asked Gabriel what emotions he felt listening to Niall\u2019s \u201cDown By the C,\u201d a two-minute composition both simple and plangent.\n\n\u201cOh goodness,\u201d he said. \u201cA roller coaster, really. It\u2019s almost a feeling of yearning, especially dividing it into the two movements. There\u2019s the last part of the song, it really just kind of flows in and out, pulling on you and pulling you back. And at the end you feel like you want more.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Tribute music raises money in honor of Niall Coti-Sears, 23, who was killed in Afghanistan.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AHpqaYB2HVTZb7rAUrWt3R7wVH4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C7YIDEGUAMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
