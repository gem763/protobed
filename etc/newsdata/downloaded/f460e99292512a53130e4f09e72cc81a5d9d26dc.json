Check out his full recipe below.\n\nInstant Pot Bo Ss\u00e4m-Style Pulled Pork Sandwiches\n\nIngredients:\n\n3 pounds skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston Butt), cut into 2\" pieces\n\n1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal or 1-1/4 tsp. Morton kosher salt\n\n2 teaspoons light brown sugar\n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n\nGinger-scallion sauce\n\n1 5-inch piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped (about \u2153 cup)\n\n4 garlic cloves, finely chopped\n\n1 large bunch of scallions, very thinly sliced (about 2 cups), divided 1/2 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil\n\n2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce\n\n1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar\n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil\n\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n\nKosher salt\n\nNapa slaw\n\n6 cups thinly shaved Napa cabbage\n\n1/4 red or white onion, very thinly sliced\n\n1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nFor assembly\n\nMayonnaise, preferably Hellman\u2019s\n\nChopped fresh cilantro\n\nLime wedges\n\nSliced jalapenos\n\nCabbage kimchi\n\nBread and butter pickles\n\nMartin\u2019s Potato Rolls\n\n\n\nABC News\n\nDirections:\n\nFor the ginger-scallion sauce, stir ginger, garlic, and two-thirds of scallions in a large bowl.\n\nHeat grapeseed oil in a small saucepan over high until oil is shimmering and hot but not smoking, about two minutes. Pour hot oil over scallion mixture. The scallions will sizzle, turn bright green, and wilt almost immediately.\n\nLet sit five minutes before stirring in remaining scallions. Stir in soy sauce, vinegar, pepper, sesame oil, and sugar; season with salt. Let sit to let flavors meld, 15 minutes.\n\nTaste and adjust seasonings. Set ginger-scallion sauce aside.\n\nPlace pork, salt, brown sugar, and pepper in Instant Pot. Toss with your hands until well combined. Add vinegar and toss again. Seal lid and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes.\n\nRelease pressure manually. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork to a large bowl. Shred meat with two forks or your hands. Pour cooking liquid over meat and toss to combine. Keep warm. For the slaw, combine cabbage and onion in a medium bowl; season generously with salt. Let sit until they start to release their water, 8 - 10 minutes, then begin to massage, gently at first so they don\u2019t break, then harder as they begin to expel their liquid, until softened to about the texture of coleslaw.\n\nPour off all excess liquid and add vinegar and oil; toss to coat. Taste and season with more salt if needed.\n\nCombine mayonnaise (preferably Hellman's), a bunch of chopped up cilantro, and lime juice to form a cilantro Mayo. Spread mayo over cut sides of rolls.\n\nAssemble sandwiches with warm shredded pork, ginger-scallion sauce, and Napa cabbage. Customize as desired with kimchi, pickles, sliced jalapeno, cilantro sprigs, and lime juice, as desired.\n\nRecipe reprinted courtesy of Bon App\u00e9tit.", "description": "Bon App\u00e9tit editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport cooks up his favorite pork sandwich recipe in an Instant Pot.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/BonAppetitBoSsamSandwich_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
