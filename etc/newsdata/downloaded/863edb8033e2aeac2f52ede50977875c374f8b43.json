We are unapologetic for cutting the water supply to the property and the taps will remain dry at the remainder of the property until Cedar Park settles its R8m debt with the City.\"\n\nREAD MORE: City of Joburg launches investigation into sale of Sandton Gautrain land\n\n\"The City cannot reconnect water to defaulting corporate customers who think they can bully the City into submission.\n\n\"It is frankly unethical for a private company to expect the government to incur costs while providing it with free services. This, while our residents are expected to fork out their hard-earned money on a monthly basis.\"\n\nThe mayor said with a growing debtor's book, the City could not afford to have its high-consuming corporate customers fall behind on payments of municipal accounts.\n\n\"Ultimately, failure to pay municipal debts negatively impacts service delivery which is budgeted for on revenue generation forecasts,\" Mashaba said.\n\n\"I will not rest until the City gets to the bottom of this apparent criminality and ensure that those who have elected to steal from our residents face the full might of the law.\"", "description": "An almost three-week water cut at the Sandton Gautrain station is expected to come to an end after the City of Johannesburg reached an out-of-court settlement with operator Bombela Concession Company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5550/91b888d367904e9bbb9a343f9528cf55.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
