(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nAbout 20 demonstrators, including Hollywood star Jane Fonda, were arrested Friday on the steps of the Capitol during a protest against the United States\u2019 lack of action on reducing climate-changing greenhouse gases.\n\nThe exercise in civil disobedience, organized by Fonda and Code Pink, was the first in a series of planned Fire Drill Fridays to call attention to the need for environmental action. Protesters said the United States has been slow to reduce carbon emissions, despite ample evidence that the atmosphere is warming because of human activity, and endangering ecosystems around the world.\n\n[Jane Fonda plans climate change civil disobedience on the Capitol steps]\n\nFonda \u2014 wearing a red coat so bright it looked as if it might be warming the planet \u2014 was arrested shortly before noon.\n\nAs police led Fonda away, along with Code Pink founder Medea Benjamin and other demonstrators who had crossed police lines and climbed the Capitol steps, a group of about 50 protesters on the plaza below chanted in call and response:\n\n\u201cWhat do we want?\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate justice!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\nTaina Litwak of Darnestown, Md., who works for the U.S. Agriculture Department, used her lunch hour to join the protest, saying the United States was not doing enough to rescue the planet. If anything, President Trump\u2019s administration has been working to undo some of the environmental protections put in place by predecessors going back to Richard M. Nixon, Litwak said.\n\n\u201cPeople think, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve cleaned up our act,\u2019 and there\u2019s this illusion the country has,\u201d said Litwak, 63. \u201cWe are still the second-most polluting country in the world, after China. We were the first for a long time, and then China took over.\u201d\n\nLitwak, waving a placard saying, \u201cYes \u2014 it IS a climate crisis,\u201d said she has seen firsthand in the department how the Trump administration has reduced spending on research on how climate change is affecting agriculture.\n\n\n\nTaina Litwak of Darnestown, Md., joined the climate change protest on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 11.

She said she was thrilled to be asked to speak on behalf of indigenous people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really the original protectors of this land, this earth,\u201d said Tayac, a member of the Piscataways. \u201cIndigenous people have lived very sustainably. And it\u2019s also indigenous communities that are impacted the most when it comes to fossil fuel industries and natural disasters, because we\u2019re very connected to the land.\u201d\n\n[The world has just over a decade to get climate change under control, U.N. scientists say]\n\nTayac said she was thrilled to meet Fonda, too.\n\n\u201cOh, my gosh, it was amazing \u2026 not only because she\u2019s a celebrity and she\u2019s done amazing work, but just meeting someone who\u2019s using their platform to spread awareness about issues is really inspiring to me,\u201d Tayac said.\n\nAriel Gold, a spokeswoman for Code Pink, said the Friday protests will continue through Jan. 10.", "description": "Fonda, along with Code Pink, plans a series of \"Fire Drill Friday\" protests to urge action on addressing human contributions to climate change.", "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t2DqLZNKmRKrNOnxGd7DPZMk5sY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AD3NNLHMJYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
