He served as assistant to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn our fast-paced digital news cycle, attention spans are short. After tomorrow\u2019s outrage, people won\u2019t remember today\u2019s \u2014 let alone last week\u2019s. Anyone looking to duck accountability for disgraceful actions can count on the relentless stream of new controversies for help.\n\nBut no matter how severe the information overload, some actions are too heinous for the public to forget.\n\nOne year ago, Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered by a hit squad dispatched on the orders of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Evidence suggests the Saudis expected to dodge justice as Jamal\u2019s case faded from memory. Initially, they stalled by denying any knowledge of Jamal\u2019s whereabouts. When the international community still insisted on answers, they claimed Jamal was the victim of a \u201crogue\" killing. Reports indicate that even months after the murder, Mohammed assured the plot\u2019s ringleader that he would restore him to the royal inner circle as soon as the furor over Jamal\u2019s death subsided.\n\n[Read this piece in Arabic]\n\nMohammed should expect to wait a long time. The world\u2019s horror over Jamal\u2019s murder won\u2019t simply blow over, for many reasons. Here are a few that should resonate with Americans of all political persuasions.\n\nThe first is the diabolical nature of the crime. Jamal was lured into Saudi Arabia\u2019s consulate in Istanbul to get a marriage license so that he could wed his Turkish fiancee. She waited for him at the consulate\u2019s gate, unaware that 15 trained assassins were lurking inside. One of the attackers was armed with a bone saw. There was no pretense of a fair fight \u2014 at a 15-to-1 disadvantage, Jamal had no hope of self-defense. These macabre and infuriating details are seared into the public\u2019s memory.\n\nSecond, people won\u2019t easily forget that the leader of a longtime U.S. ally \u2014 and the recipient of enormous amounts of U.S. aid \u2014 directed the killing of a U.S. resident working for a U.S. newspaper. This brazen aggression is part of a broader pattern of brutality on the part of Mohammed. As the 34-year-old crown prince consolidates power, he has waged a campaign to silence dissidents, held 200 business leaders prisoner inside a Ritz-Carlton, jailed and tortured female activists seeking basic freedoms, kidnapped the prime minister of a sovereign nation and fueled a devastating war in Yemen. That a U.S. ally would show such flagrant disregard for our values, expecting no consequences, speaks volumes about the way the United States is now perceived. The alarm that Americans feel about our diminished standing is unlikely to fade.\n\nThis is related to the third reason the attack on Jamal remains alive in the public\u2019s memory: America\u2019s response. Following the murder, the Trump administration chased potential weapons deals with the Saudis instead of mustering the courage to defend America\u2019s values of press freedom and human rights. When the president of the United States abandons our principles because a tyrant writes a big check, Americans are angered and disheartened.\n\nAmericans are not the only people paying attention. Authoritarian regimes around the world are taking note. The impotent reaction from our government\u2019s leaders signals to strongmen everywhere that they can terrorize their people \u2014 and mock the United States \u2014 with impunity.\n\nFourth, it will prove hard to forget the administration\u2019s unexplained snub of the CIA, the United Nations and Congress. Although the CIA\u2019s investigation concluded with high confidence that Mohammed ordered Jamal\u2019s killing, the agency\u2019s experts were ignored. The U.N. special rapporteur investigating the case declared that the United States is allowing itself \u201cto be made complicit in what is, by all appearances, a miscarriage of justice\u201d and called on the FBI to probe further. No action on the bureau\u2019s part has been announced.\n\nPerhaps most egregiously, the administration continues to stonewall Congress in violation of the terms of the Global Magnitsky Act. Last year, a bipartisan group of senators invoked the act, requiring the president to report to Congress on the administration\u2019s findings about who killed Jamal. Under the law, the report was due in February. Congress is still waiting.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t like to see important institutions and branches of our government callously brushed aside. It belittles and demoralizes the men and women who risk their lives every day to provide the intelligence that keeps our nation safe. And it offends our sensibilities as a nation of laws.\n\nFifth, the memory of Jamal\u2019s killing will be long-lasting because its effects will be long-lasting. We will forever be deprived of the stories he would have written and so will remain forever ignorant of corruption he might have exposed, heroism he might have praised and insights he might have offered.\n\nJamal\u2019s story cannot be forgotten. If it is, his murderers will succeed in evading justice. And Jamal Khashoggi will not be Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s last victim.\n\nYet we can be comforted that, for all of these reasons, Jamal will still be on our minds next Oct. 2 \u2014 and for many years to come. And we hope that someday, when Saudi Arabia and the United States have a better class of leadership, Jamal\u2019s case will be remembered as a turning point. It might be recorded as the moment when Saudi Arabia began to understand the consequences of its brutality, when the United States learned important lessons about standing up for its values, and when both countries rediscovered liberty, human rights and respect for the truth.\n\nRead more about Jamal Khashoggi:\n\nA missing voice, a growing chorus\n\nHala Al-Dosari: Saudi Arabia\u2019s monarchy has left the country fragile and unbalanced\n\nHatice Cengiz: My quest for justice continues.
