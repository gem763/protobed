Also, the Supreme Court will take up at least one abortion case in its new term, and the administration is taking heat from the right over its new vaping policy.\n\nWe'll start with drug pricing...\n\nButtigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices\n\nPharma does not fare too well in 2020 Democratic campaign proposals, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's plan, released Monday is no exception. The presidential candidate's plan is similar to the one championed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi-backed group funding ads for vulnerable Democrats amid impeachment inquiry Trump to hold Louisiana rally for GOP candidates in governor's race Graham vows to publicly question whistleblowers if Trump is impeached MORE (D-Calif.).\n\nButtigieg would:\n\nAllow both Medicare and the new public option plan he would create to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, and those lower prices would be available to people with private insurance too.\n\nCap out-of-pocket drug costs in Medicare at $200 per month and force drug companies to pay rebates back if their prices rose faster than inflation.\n\nFor the \"worst offender\" companies, he would exercise rarely used authority under current law to strip firms of their patents if they were not offering a drug at a reasonable price.\n\nBigger picture: Lowering drug prices is a top priority for voters and Democratic presidential candidates have put forward a range of very tough plans across the spectrum. Even the more moderate candidates, like former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment Why Elizabeth Warren will fail to shine in her moment on the trail MORE and Buttigieg, are proposing to crack down hard on the industry.

Wade and other decisions the Supreme Court has made over the years in favor of abortion access.\n\nThe case centers on a Louisiana law that would require doctors at abortion clinics have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a requirement critics say is aimed at forcing those clinics to close.\n\n\"For the first time in at least 25 years the court does not have a majority of justices who are committed to the legacy of a constitutional right to abortion on demand. That's huge,\" said Steven Aden, chief legal officer and general counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion legal group.\n\nPotential changes coming: The Supreme Court in 2016 struck down a similar Texas law in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt. Justices said in the 5-3 ruling that admitting privilege requirements posed obstacles to abortion access and created an \"undue burden\" for women.\n\nBut that ruling came at a time when the court had only eight justices following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. It was also before the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote who often sided with the court's liberal wing on abortion.\n\nOther cases: The court is expected to decide soon whether it will hear a challenge to an Indiana law that requires women get ultrasounds at least 18 hours before an abortion.\n\nRead more on the case here.\n\nFirst lady calls for end to marketing e-cigarettes at youth\n\nMelania Trump Melania TrumpOvernight Energy: San Francisco pushes back against Trump over water pollution claims | Court says EPA not doing enough on cross-state smog | Iceberg larger than Los Angeles breaks off Antarctica Overnight Energy: White House axes advisory boards for marine life, invasive species | Northeast states move to reduce transportation emissions | Judge allows Bears Ears lawsuit to proceed White House announces dates for annual fall garden tours MORE wants e-cigarette companies to stop marketing to underage people.\n\nIn a speech Monday at the Drug Enforcement Agency, the first lady said teenagers and young adults who suffer from addiction, including to e-cigarettes, need to be encouraged to admit they have a problem and get help.\n\n\"It is important to me that we all work to educate children and families about the dangers associated with this habit,\" she said. \"Marketing this addictive product to children must stop.\"\n\nMelania Trump was one of the driving forces behind President Trump's crackdown on flavored vaping products.\n\nState of play: E-cigarette companies have been adamant they never deliberately targeted underage youth in their advertising campaigns. Some, including market-leader Juul Labs, have stopped all advertising in the U.S. as scrutiny of the companies' marketing practices has grown sharper.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTrump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown\n\nThe Trump administration is under fire from conservative groups and some GOP lawmakers, who are pushing back over its planned crackdown on e-cigarette flavors.\n\nThey say the administration is overreaching, and the flavor ban will harm small businesses, a violation of core Republican free market principles.\n\nBut so far, President Trump has shown he will listen to his health advisers, who say that sweeping the market of all flavors except tobacco is the best way to cut down on an epidemic of youth vaping.\n\nTrump and federal health officials last month announced a crackdown on the sale of all nontobacco flavors of e-cigarettes until they can be submitted for regulatory review.\n\nKey quote: The scope of the administration's plans has some of its staunchest allies crying foul.\n\n\"It would be disastrous. Maybe not for the big guys who sell e-cigarettes like Juul, but for the more than 10,000 independent retailers whose sole business model is the sale of these products -- these are the guys that would be put out of business overnight,\" said Paul Blair, director of strategic initiatives at Americans for Tax Reform (ATR).\n\nRead more on the criticism from the right here.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nThree scientists win Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels (Stat News)\n\nVapers accuse officials of overreach as investigation into deadly lung illness lags (Kaiser Health News)\n\nElizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenWhy Elizabeth Warren will fail to shine in her moment on the trail Sanders at home in Vermont after release from hospital Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates?
