The study, which is believed to have a profound implications for understanding funeral practices, was published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nThe discovery of two individuals buried hand-in-hand, or even embracing, is nothing new. The Lovers of Valdaro, who died nearly 6,000 years ago, were buried in Italy\u2019s northern province of Mantua. There have been other cases in Greece, Turkey, Romania and Siberia. In all of these instances, however, the couples were male and female.\n\n\u201cThere are currently no other examples of this type,\u201d Federico Lugli, a researcher at the University of Bologna and the lead author of the Nature study, told Rai News. \u201cMany tombs have been found in the past with couples holding hands, but in all cases there was a man and a woman. What might have been the bond between the two individuals in the burial in Modena remains a mystery.\u201d\n\nResearchers believe the two might have been siblings, cousins or soldiers who died together in battle. Some skeletons of other individuals discovered in the same area showed signs of trauma, probably related to death during times of violent conflict.\n\n\u2022 This article was updated on 13 September 2019 to correct the name of the journal the work appeared in: it was Scientific Reports, not Nature.", "description": "Researchers believe pair might have been siblings, cousins or soldiers who died together", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo", "Jonathan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f04133e14034a4222c5bf2619482c874594bb4f2/0_38_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1cc132fbec18d421822da3c8e21a5adf"}
