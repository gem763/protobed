I don't see the logic.\"\n\n\"Like many parents I'm appalled it's happening, some students were not aware it was a camera and they had been changing in that area.\"\n\nShe posted the photo on social media where it has attracted more than 500 comments from other concerned mums, dads and guardians.\n\nA woman said: \"Cameras should not be in the toilets, end of! If bullying happens in the toilet then have a staff member present!\"\n\nAnother disagreed: \"It\u2019s not actually pointing to the toilet area, it\u2019s pointing to the sinks! All due to too much vandalism and smoking in the toilets!\"\n\nAnother mother added: \"I spoke to my lad and he said they're in the boys toilet as well.\"\n\nThe school says the purpose of the cameras is to act as a deterrent to poor behaviour and bullying and have captured \"vital\" evidence in the past.\n\nDavid Dawes, principal of the school, said: \u201cLike many schools we are fortunate to have effective CCTV coverage of all parts of the academy to ensure the safety of students, staff and visitors at all times.\n\n\u201cThis includes student toilets where the purpose of the cameras is to act as a deterrent to poor behaviour and bullying, which sadly is more of a risk in toilet areas.\n\n\"The cameras are not concealed, are visible to all students and have been in place since the school was built in 2003.\"\n\nHe added: \"The cameras point away from the cubicles and the personal privacy of students is no way compromised.\n\n\"Whilst the footage is not monitored constantly, where incidents have occurred it has provided vital evidence to enable the school to act and to be able to reassure parents regarding the safety of their children.\u201d\n\nA Cleveland Police spokeswoman confirmed officers had investigated the mum's complant.\n\nShe said: \"We can confirm that we received a report on October 8 regarding CCTV use at a Coulby Newham school.\n\n\"We have looked into the report and checked the cameras so we are satisfied there is no misuse.\n\n\"We have informed the caller of this.\"\n\nThe most recent Ofsted inspection was carried out in early 2017 when the school was rated as \"good\".\n\nThe school has 1,225 pupils, according to the Ofsted report.", "description": "The head of King's Academy in Middlesbrough said the camera was installed to curb bullying and vandalism", "authors": ["Samuel Jones", "Lorraine King"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556068.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Kings-Academy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
