To show why, he says what the bank has done is akin to leaving a key to a house hidden on a front porch.\n\n\"When they leave the keys out, you can see the keys and you can see the lock, but nobody will know 100 per cent if the key actually works or not,\" or indeed if anyone entered the house, he said in an interview. \"Whether somebody did go in or not we would never know and whether the key would fit the lock also we would not know.\"\n\nIn a statement to CBC News, the bank said its technical teams were \"working to remove the information\" from the web, but stressed that the data on the bank's 25 million customers is secure.\n\n\"The information that was posted on an online data repository does not contain information that would put our customers, employees and partners at risk,\" the bank said.", "description": "A Canadian IT consultant is raising the alarm after he says he found some sensitive software\u00a0code belonging to Scotiabank on a popular online file-sharing repository.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291880.1569008578!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/scotiabank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
