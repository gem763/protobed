Australia group executive for corporate affairs, policy and government relations Campbell Reid drew a link between Wednesday\u2019s raid and the June 4 raid on Smethurst\u2019s home.\n\nPolice were searching for the source of Smethurst\u2019s 2018 report that Defense Department and Home Affairs Department bosses had canvassed giving the Australian Signals Directorate new legal powers to spy on Australians.\n\n\u201cWe have always said the AFP raids on journalists were not intended to intimidate journalists but the people who have the courage to talk to journalists,\u201d Reid said in a statement, referring to the Australian Federal Police. \u201cToday we are seeing that process of intimidation continue.\u201d\n\nGill is the husband of Australian Ambassador to Iraq Joanne Loundes.\n\nPolice spent around seven hours at the house before leaving with garbage bags full of material.\n\nCanberra lawyer Kamy Saeedi told reporters at the house after police left that it was a \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201csensitive\u201d situation and he could not comment.\n\nNews Corp. and the ABC have launched legal challenges to the warrants executed in June. Police wanted the ABC\u2019s sources of classified information that formed the basis of 2017 reports that Australian troops had killed unarmed men and children in Afghanistan in potential war crimes.\n\nThe Australian Signals Directorate did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nPolice said the target of the warrant was a \u201cCommonwealth official,\u201d but refused further comment.\n\nAustralian media organizations have joined together in response to the raids to demand legal reforms that would exempt journalists from national security laws passed since 2012 that \u201cwould put them in jail for doing their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe government responded by asking a parliamentary committee to hold an inquiry into the impact of Australian law enforcement and intelligence powers on press freedom.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police on Wednesday executed a search warrant on the home of an Australian intelligence officer in a raid that one media executive described as an attempt to intimidate people who talk to journalists.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rod Mcguirk"], "top_image": ""}
