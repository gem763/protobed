I went back into drinking again. I went the second time, which I have written about in my latest song.'\n\n'I was in rehab, talking in the circle with everyone, I saw a flash of light and saw a crystal apparition, a prism of light, like a diamond.\n\n'I was just like: \"What is that?\" and then I turned and it was gone. And then I could see it by the girl next to me. They asked me if they just thought I was coming down off the drink.\n\nAsked if he still drinks, the father-of-one admitted: 'I used to drink because I was sad, but now I'm not sad so I can have one glass but I have to be sensible.\n\n'I used to drink really heavily so I don't anymore, I made a promise with my doctor not to touch whiskey.'\n\nTurning point: When asked what made him realise how bad his situation was, Lee revealed: 'Duncan found me going through his cupboards looking for booze and chucked me into rehab'\n\nSensible: Asked if he still drinks, the father-of-one admitted: 'I used to drink because I was sad, but now I'm not sad so I can have one glass but I have to be sensible'\n\nJust days ago, Lee revealed he still struggles with alcohol 'now and again' after describing himself as having been a 'good alcoholic' for ten years.\n\nThe Blue singer previously told how he would sometimes drink a bottle of whiskey a day to 'numb the pain' but he has put those days behind him.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun Online, he said: 'I still struggle now and again.

If anything, now I have a couple of beers to relax and be social but there was points where I wouldn\u2019t drink socially, I would drink inwardly and the bottle was my friend.'\n\nLee went on to the say that he's happy he never became dependent on drugs but added that he 'dabbled' with them in the past.\n\n'I\u2019ve never been a big drug person, and I\u2019m quite happy about that. I\u2019m so happy that I was never mad on drugs,' he said.\n\nLee gave up alcohol when he appeared on Strictly Come Dancing last year but began drinking again following his appearance on the show.\n\nWriting in Blue's memoir, All Rise, Lee said: 'If I had to quantify it, I could safely say at that point in my life, I was drinking around a bottle of whisky a night.\n\n'It was all going in the wrong direction as they say, and I\u2019d had warnings from my doctor, but if I\u2019m honest I wasn\u2019t paying them any heed because I wanted to get properly lost.'\n\nThe Strictly Come Dancing star added that he was in a shaky mental state when he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2014.\n\nWhen he was arrested for drink-driving and held in a police cell after leaving the house, he 'taunted' the officers there.\n\nHe said: 'I still struggle now and again. I struggle in my own way that I don\u2019t use drink to forget and that was the point' (pictured in July 2019)\n\nSpeaking in the tell-all book All Rise, he said: 'The destructive behaviour I'd been hell-bent on for over a year had reached its only logical conclusion.\n\nThe reports said that I urinated in the police cell. I don't actually remember but the truth is, I was hoping they would beat me up so I may well have been taunting them to fight me. When people are telling you over and over again you're a piece of s*** you start to believe it.\n\n'I wanted them to chuck me away and leave me alone. I wanted to get lost. I think you reflect what you're given so I'd absorbed all the anger and abuse that had been directed at me and this was how it was coming out.'\n\nLee went to rehab for a second time after that and gradually overhauled his life by going to the gym and weening himself off alcohol.", "description": "The Celebs Go Dating star, 36, also explained he now allows himself to have one glass but 'has to be sensible' with alcohol, and doesn't touch whiskey", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/15/19300114-0-image-a-7_1570199376628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
