There are even suggestion that we ourselves would be a target for sanctions.\"\n\nThe United States and China were two of the three biggest export destinations for Malaysia between January and August this year. Singapore was the top destination.\n\nTo cushion the impact of the collision between the superpowers, Mahathir said Malaysia was collaborating more with its regional neighbours.\n\nMahathir also complained of being bullied by powerful nations, referring to a campaign by European countries against Malaysia's agricultural mainstay of palm oil. The edible oil contributed 2.8% of Malaysia's gross domestic product last year and 4.5% to total exports.\n\n\"Having cleared most of their forests and refusing to reduce their noxious emissions, they now try to impoverish the poor by preventing them from clearing their forest for living space and earning a living,\" he said.\n\nThe European Union passed an act earlier this year to phase out palm oil from renewable fuel by 2030 due to deforestation concerns.\n\nThere are also concerns that India, one of the biggest buyers of Malaysian palm oil, would restrict imports of the product due to a diplomatic row over comments made by Mahathir on New Delhi's recent actions in the disputed South Asian region of Kashmir.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.
