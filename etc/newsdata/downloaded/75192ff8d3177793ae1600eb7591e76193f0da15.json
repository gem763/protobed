One of the stars of this movement was the filmmaker Pedro Almod\u00f3var. One of his favourite actors was a young Banderas.\n\nNow, for the first time in years, Banderas has reunited with Almod\u00f3var for their eighth film together, Pain and Glory. It's about a film director in his physical decline who feels that he has no reason to live without his art. The character is loosely based on Almod\u00f3var himself.\n\nHost Tom Power with Antonio Banderas at the InterContinental Hotel in Toronto. (Vivian Rashotte/CBC)\n\nThe actor joined q's Tom Power at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival to talk about working with his long-time friend and collaborator, and why he finds his character in Pain and Glory so relatable.\n\n\"I wouldn't understand a life without art,\" said Banderas. \"Could you understand a life without music? Without looking at paintings, movies or theatre? ... It's like food. We need art to live because it's a reflection of ourselves.\"\n\nPain and Glory hits theatres on Friday, Oct. 25.\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Antonio Banderas.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bVanessa Greco", "description": "Before he was Zorro or Puss in Boots,\u00a0Antonio\u00a0Banderas\u00a0was the go-to male lead for Spanish auteur Pedro Almod\u00f3var.
