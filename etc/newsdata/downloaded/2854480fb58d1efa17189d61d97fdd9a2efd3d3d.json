Gavin Newsom in July that requires presidential candidates to release their tax returns, a move aimed squarely at the Republican president.\n\nRepublican National Committee member Shawn Steel said he was confident the law would be voided in court. He said the rule change Sunday represented a stop-gap measure, if needed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just planning ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nThe one-time change, worked out with the Trump campaign, provides a pathway to send state delegates to the national convention, even if Trump is blocked from the state ballot.\n\nIt would allow the party to hold a special convention after the state\u2019s March 2020 primary and determine the candidate, in this case Trump, who would compile a slate of delegates and alternates to send to the national convention.\n\nThe Trump campaign has sued to block the law, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution by adding an additional requirement to run for president and by denying voters their right to associate with their chosen candidates.\n\nLeading Democratic candidates for president have publicly disclosed their personal income tax returns while Trump has refused to do so, breaking with decades of tradition by candidates from both parties.\n\nEven if the law withstands a legal challenge, Trump could avoid the requirement by choosing not to compete in California\u2019s March 3, 2020, primary.\n\nThe Republican National Committee does not require candidates to appear on primary ballots in all 50 states. With no credible GOP challenger at this point, Trump likely won\u2019t need California\u2019s delegates to win the Republican nomination. The law does not apply to the general election ballot.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The one-time change, worked out with the Trump campaign, provides a pathway to send state delegates to the national convention, even if Trump is blocked from the state ballot.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/California_Republicans_Trump_Primary_81243.jpg-4c87d_c0-131-3132-1957_s1770x1032.jpg?5bf005407a5d6317295e55a7eb2a3efdaf114d52", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
