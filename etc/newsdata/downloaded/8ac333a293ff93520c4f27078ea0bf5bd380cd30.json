And it said it would be \u201cregulating these lightbulbs out of existence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Energy Department flat out got it wrong today,\u201d Jason Hartke, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, said in a statement. \u201cInstead of moving us forward, this rule will keep more energy-wasting bulbs on store shelves and saddle the average American household with about $100 in unnecessary energy costs every year.\u201d\n\nHartke also said inefficient lightbulbs were also \u201cterrible for our climate.\u201d He said the rule would require the electricity produced by 25 coal power plants \u201cjust to power wasteful bulbs.\u201d\n\nSaving energy used by lightbulbs was a goal set by Congress in 2007 when it adopted bipartisan legislation later signed by President George W. Bush. The law set high efficiency standards for lightbulbs, effectively moving the country toward more-efficient compact fluorescent and LED bulbs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn President Barack Obama\u2019s last day in office, the Energy Department issued definitions that widened standards for general service lamps and general service incandescent lamps.\n\nThe final rule undoes that and the proposed rule would eliminate the 2020 standards for A-lamps, which are the commonly used pear-shaped bulbs.\n\nThe standards, while technical, affect approximately 3 billion \u2014 nearly half \u2014 of the bulbs currently in sockets in U.S. homes. They include three-way bulbs, cone-shaped reflector bulbs used in recessed and track lighting, candle-shaped bulbs used in chandeliers and sconces, and round globe-shaped bulbs used in bathroom lighting fixtures.\n\nAD\n\nFifteen states, New York City and the District of Columbia filed comments opposing the rollback and questioning whether the Energy Department had the authority to exempt certain products under the 2007 legislation. The group said repealing the Obama definitions \u201cwould unconscionably increase both greenhouse gas emissions and consumers\u2019 energy costs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFour states, including California, Colorado, Washington and Vermont, enacted their own appliance standards.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, conservatives made the lightbulb standards a rallying point for complaints about government interference. \u201cLet there be incandescent light and freedom. That\u2019s the American way,\u201d radio commentator Rush Limbaugh said on a broadcast several years ago.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis rule gives consumers the power to choose what lighting products best meet their needs,\u201d the Energy Department said in a statement Wednesday. The statement conceded the incandescent bulbs that would have been barred \u201ccannot meet the threshold efficiency level.\u201d\n\nThe 2007 law doesn\u2019t ban incandescent bulbs. It set energy standards, and some companies came up with ways to make incandescent bulbs that complied with some of the standards.\n\n\u201cIt makes zero sense to eliminate energy-saving lightbulb standards that will save households money on electricity bills and cut climate change emissions,\u201d Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the Trump administration is siding with manufacturers that want to keep selling outdated, energy-wasting lightbulbs.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "DOE issues final rule extending the sales of incandescent lightbulbs, rolling back regulations that implement a 2007 bipartisan law.", "authors": ["Steven Mufson", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Climate Change"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vN933Fa_QKhcuvyBV65vQ-KRsvk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KN247KWPFII6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
