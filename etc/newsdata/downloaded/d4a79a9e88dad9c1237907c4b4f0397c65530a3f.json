She was very upset and I've never actually been through anything like that.\n\n\"I've had people place packages in the wrong area or throw it over the gate and it breaking, but I've never actually been through someone disrespecting me, my home and my packages in that manner.\n\n\"I guess she was upset about the fact that I put the note on there. As you can see in the video she was cursing, she was mad and she flicked my camera off.\n\n\"I clicked on the notification link and watched her as she did it, and I was like 'this is unbelievable'.\"\n\nChris said the driver's reaction to his note was 'very disrespectful', 'uncalled for' and 'unprofessional'.\n\nHe recalled his time when he was working for Amazon and said he received 'frustrating' notes from customers and acted professionally.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nHe continued: \"The notes could be a little frustrating because I had customers who would put very vulgar information in the notes - and one customer would actually curse.\n\n\"It was nothing personal towards me because he didn't know exactly who I am, but at the same time, if a customer is frustrated what can we do about that?\n\n\"If a customer puts something in their notes that we particularly don't like, we can't be disrespectful - we're still on the job.\"\n\nAn Amazon spokesman said: \"This does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners.\n\n\"The driver will no longer be delivering on behalf of Amazon.\"", "description": "The driver read a delivery note and swore at the doorbell camera as she put down the parcel by the doorstep in Houston, Texas", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20681544.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-KNM_SWEARING_AMAZON_DRIVER_3jpgd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
