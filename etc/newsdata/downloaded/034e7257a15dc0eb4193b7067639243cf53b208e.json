Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nThe full statement: It comes after Coleen revealed on Wednesday how she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' Rebekah leaking stories\n\nClose friends only! Coleen planted several fake stories on her personal Instagram account (pictured), which has just 366 followers, but changed her privacy settings so that only Rebekah could see her posts. Eventually, several of these decoy stories ended up in The Sun, which, according to Coleen, conclusively proves that Rebekah was the source of the leak\n\nSuspicious minds: Coleen (pictured in Liverpool on April 14, 2018) suspected that someone close to her had been betraying her for years\n\nThe saga began when Coleen, 33, revealed on social media she had suspected someone close to her had been betraying her for years and she had conclusive proof that her friend Rebekah was the guilty party.\n\nColeen admitted that stories about her basement flooding, returning to TV and gender selection were only viewed by Rebekah and these were subsequently followed by media outlets, including MailOnline.\n\nThe Sun has since removed its story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\nThe FAKE stories Coleen shared which were sold to The Sun and followed by media outlets Wayne and Coleen Rooney's \u00a320m 'Morrisons' manor is 'flooded On Tuesday, it was claimed that the Rooney's basement had flooded due to Storm Lorenzo. It was said to have caused a 'massively stressful' setback in the completion of the sprawling three-storey mansion Coleen Rooney 'is so desperate for a baby girl that she's looked into controversial \u00a38K gender selection treatment' The Sun first reported that mother of four sons, Coleen had looked into 'gender selection' treatment in a desperate bid for a daughter and had flown to Mexico earlier this year to discuss the controversial \u00a38,000 treatment with doctors Coleen Rooney 'hopes to revive her TV career including a Strictly stint now she's moved back to the UK' after husband Wayne's scandal The Sun wrote that she was in talks to revive her once-successful UK TV career now her family has moved back to this side of the Atlantic. The mother-of-four apparently had to decline the offer to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing but could compete in 2020\n\nColeen wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account.\n\n'(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\nShe continued: 'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nShe concluded: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it...'\n\nRebekah, who is currently on holiday with Jamie in Dubai, hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can't believe I'm even having to write this. I'm pregnant and on holiday and am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I'm now having to take legal advice as I can't deal with this stress myself when I'm this pregnant.'\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all the accusations against her within minutes of Coleen's post being published, saying she has no reason to sell stories to the tabloids\n\nWas she hacked? Denying she ever leaked stories about Coleen, Rebekah (pictured) explained that other people may have access to her Instagram account\n\nShe added: 'As I have just said to you [Coleen] on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'\n\nNothing to see here! The Sun has since removed its story about Wayne and Coleen's basement flooding after it transpired she had made it up as part of her sting to trap Rebekah. The page has been replaced with a melting ice cream picture\n\nReal life Footballer's Wives! Coleen's social media 'detective skills' have made headlines across the world, with fans calling her 'Wagatha Christie'. Even Netflix UK has joked about making a documentary about her incredible expos\u00e9\n\nShe continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my Instagram and just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n'I liked you a lot Coleen and I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'\n\nRebekah's spokesperson also told MailOnline: 'Please refer to Becky's social media posts.\n\n'It isn't true, she is now very upset and stressed so has passed it to her legal team to deal with. Such a shame that Coleen didn't just call her when she had her number.'", "description": "Sam Armytage says she once outed her untrustworthy friends in a similar way to how\u00a0Coleen Rooney exposed Rebekah Vardy for allegedly leaking stories about her to the British tabloid press.", "authors": ["Jo Scrimshire For Daily Mail Australia", "Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19516450-0-image-a-42_1570662903859.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
