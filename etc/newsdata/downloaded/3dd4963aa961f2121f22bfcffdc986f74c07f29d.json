The release date was revealed a month ago, but what wasn\u2019t known until now was that the game has an optional \u201cGold Pass\u201d subscription.\n\nThe Gold Pass gives you various in-game items and badges as you play, and also unlocks the faster 200cc mode. It\u2019s not really clear from the game\u2019s website what any of these items are for. There\u2019s a two-week free trial, after which you\u2019ll have to pay $4.99 a month.\n\n$4.99 a month is also, you may have noticed, the price for a month of Apple Arcade, Apple\u2019s excellent new service specifically designed to fix the microtransaction-riddled hellhole that mobile gaming has descended into. Maybe Mario Kart Tour is an incredible experience that will be worth subscribing to, but my bet is that you\u2019ll be better off spending your five bucks on Sonic Racing and, um, every other game on Apple Arcade.\n\nWe\u2019d let you know how Mario Kart Tour is, but opening the app right now returns an error message stating that the servers are full and that our \u201clogin request will be processed in the order it was received,\u201d which is definitely what you want to hear when opening a mobile game. Stay tuned for our eventual review.", "description": "Mario Kart Tour is launching today, and there\u2019s a previously unknown subscription option called the Gold Pass.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etes1NnvTe01WzM_a5g6rZgerOU=/0x23:600x337/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19230818/7BE086BE_4104_4EC1_8C5E_79E41BB43F5C.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
