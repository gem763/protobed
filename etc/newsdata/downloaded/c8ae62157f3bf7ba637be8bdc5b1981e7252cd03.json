Those moments often end in 'restorative conversations' between him and the students.\n\nAnderson is appealing the termination and has the backing of his community, who feel the policy is 'lazy'\n\nWest High Principal Karen Boran sent an email to parents on Wednesday to inform them of the 'serious incident' that involved 'a staff member using a racial slur with students.'\n\n'As you know, our expectation when it comes to racial slurs has been very clear,' Boran said. 'Regardless of context or circumstance, racial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.'\n\nBoran added that the zero-tolerance approach 'has been applied consistently and will continue to be applied consistently.'\n\n'I also want to ask for your partnership as we work to make our school climate the very best it can be for all of our students and our staff,' she added.\n\nSuperintendent Jane Belmore reiterated the sentiment, adding that there 'has been shared several times through communication and professional development.'\n\nIn the last school year, there were at least seven cases where employees were either fired or resigned for using the slur.\n\nAnderson is appealing the termination and has the backing of his community, who feel the policy is 'lazy.'\n\n'MMSD needs to modify this lazy, harmful and whole-punched policy that allows it to avoid doing the real work that any HR department should do by looking at the context in which such a word (or any other) is used,' explained Kaleem Caire, former CEO of the Urban League of Greater Madison.\n\n'They are an academic institution and should be educating themselves and young people about the use of words like N****r, not running from it.\n\nShe later added: 'Marlon should get his job back plus back-pay. Sometimes leaders have to admit they made a mistake rather than hide behind the mistakes they\u2019ve made. It feels like that is what MMSD is doing here.\n\nThey committed to a flawed policy that was reactionary and not well thought through.", "description": "In a brief Facebook post made on Wednesday, Marlon Anderson shared that he was fired from the Madison Metropolitan School District after telling the student not to call him the slur.", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19863328-0-image-a-21_1571356303620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
