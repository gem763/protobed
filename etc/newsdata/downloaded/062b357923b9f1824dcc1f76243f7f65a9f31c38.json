Weiss. source HBO and Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nThe six final episodes of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiered earlier this year, and now all the scripts are available to read at the the Writers Guild Foundation Shavelson-Webb Library in Los Angeles. Penned by the series\u2019 showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, as well as Dave Hill and Bryan Cogman, the scripts reveal details about scenes you wouldn\u2019t have known based on the aired episodes.\n\nKeep reading for a look at the most significant changes, background details, and other fun facts we found inside the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d season eight scripts.\n\nOne stage direction note from Dany\u2019s arrival to Winterfell explains her isolation in the North.\n\ncaption Dany and Jon arriving to Winterfell on the first episode of the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source HBO\n\nThroughout the scripts for these final six episode, the writers (Dave Hill, Bryan Cogman, David Benioff, and D.B. Weiss) include small stage directions that indicate what characters are thinking. Many of the notes for Dany\u2019s character chart her season eight arc from heroic queen to slaughterer of innocents.\n\nThe first of these in the scripts come when Dany and Jon are riding towards Winterfell.\n\nWhen Dany noticed the townspeople staring at her \u2013 in a \u201csullen and suspicious\u201d way, according to the scripts \u2013 Jon tries to say he warned her about Northerners\u2019 mistrust of outsiders.\n\nAt first Dany nods in response, thinking \u201cshe can handle it.\u201d Then Rhaegal and Drogon fly overhead, terrifying the smallfolk and making them duck in fear.\n\n\u201cThe barest hint of a smile crosses Dany\u2019s face,\u201d the scripts stage direction says. \u201cEat me, northerners.\u201d\n\nMore of Dany\u2019s mindset is explained when she meets Sam Tarly for the first time.\n\ncaption Dany delivers bad news to Sam Tarly on the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d season eight premiere. source Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nIn the script, Sam tells her it\u2019s an honor to serve her and that they\u2019d stand no chance in the war to come without her.\n\n\u201cFinally, some bloody gratitude,\u201d the script says. \u201cDany likes this guy.\u201d\n\nDany\u2019s growing isolation was apparent throughout the early episode of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on the screen, but it\u2019s interesting to read more of how miffed she felt upon arriving to Winterfell and getting the cold shoulder from Sansa and the other Northerners.\n\nThere is extra tragedy layered into this moment given that Dany so quickly warmed to Sam when, just moments later, she had to tell him that she had executed his father and brother. She came very close to having an important friend and ally in Winterfell, but that was taken from her, too.\n\nThe comedic beat that happened when Jon and Bran reunite wasn\u2019t planned out in the script.\n\ncaption Jon looks confused when Bran tells him he\u2019s \u201calmost\u201d a man. source HBO\n\nOther details in the scripts show how some of the stars on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d interpreted stage directions slightly differently, changing the original intention of scenes.\n\nWhen Jon finally Bran again, he remarked on how Bran was a \u201cman\u201d now. Then Bran replied, in his odd way, with a simple \u201calmost.\u201d\n\nThe script says that \u201cJon is too happy to be reunited with his little brother to clock the oddness of the statement.\u201d\n\nBut in practice this moment played much more comically when actor Kit Harington\u2019s face dropped slightly in reaction to the statement. He definitely \u201cclocks the oddness\u201d in the final version of the episode.\n\nDave Hill, the credited writer for \u201cWinterfell,\u201d had a cameo has one of the guards killed by Theon as he saves Yara.\n\ncaption \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d writer Dave Hill on season eight, episode one, \u201cWinterfell.\u201d source HBO\n\nThere were many notable cameos throughout the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d including actors Rob McElhenney (\u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d) and Martin Starr (\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d) who played other guards killed in this very same scene.\n\nHill\u2019s cameo was specifically scripted for this episode, though, setting it apart from some of the other famous faces seen on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nRead more: All 8 times musicians sneakily appeared on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\n\nTheon and Yara also originally had a heart-to-heart about how he abandoned her on season seven.\n\ncaption Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d season eight, episode one, \u201cWinterfell.\u201d source HBO\n\nAfter escaping from Euron\u2019s ship, the finished episode jumps to Theon and Yara discussing their strategy against their uncle. But in the script, Theon starts the scene by gingerly touching a bruise on his face left from Yara\u2019s headbutt.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a girl,\u201d Yara says in the script.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for Theon to talk about the night be betrayed his sister and jumped overboard, but he finally brings himself to say the words,\u201d the script\u2019s stage direction reads.\n\nThen Theon calls himself a coward, and Yara tells him he wasn\u2019t a coward the night before when he saved her. He tries to press the point of how he wasn\u2019t there when she needed him, but Yara says there\u2019s no point talking about it. Then they move onto the dialogue we hear in the final version.\n\nThis was the last time Theon and Yara spoke before his death, so it would have been a more explicit closure for them (instead of the implicit closure they had when he rescued her).\n\nThe writers also give nods to the behind-the-scenes production team leaders like Michele Clapton.\n\ncaption Cersei Lannister, played by Lena Headey, on the eighth and final season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nThroughout their scripts, the writers often penned stage directions or descriptions of scenes and actors with nods to the people bringing those scenes to life. On the first episode of the season, the script introduces Cersei in a scene for the first time and gives a shout out to the lead costume designer Michele Claptoon.\n\n\u201c[Cersei] wears black, but not the glittering triumphant black of [season seven],\u201d the script says. \u201cThis outfit is brooding and somber, a Michele Clapton masterpiece.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a funny aside about Emilia Clarke needing to act opposite the \u201cgreen foam head\u201d stand-in for Drogon.\n\ncaption Emilia Clarke on set with the green \u201cdragon\u201d head on a pole in a behind-the-scenes look at filming \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source Pixomondo\n\nAgain on the first episode of the season, Daenerys and Jon Snow go to visit her two remaining dragons.\n\n\u201cShe and Drogon share a connection that is deep and intimate but non-verbal,\u201d the script says. \u201cEmilia Clarke conveys this depth and intimacy while interacting with a green foam head.\u201d\n\nDany\u2019s feelings of isolation were exacerbated on the second episode of the season, and it shows the most when Theon arrives to Winterfell.\n\ncaption Sansa and Theon hugging on season eight, episode two, \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d source HBO\n\nAs we explored back when the episode aired, \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u201d did a lot of work to show just how alone Daenerys was in the North. The script makes this isolation and unease apparent when Theon says he wants to fight for Winterfell and then he and Sansa embrace.\n\n\u201cYet another of her subjects whose loyalties seem to lie with House Stark over her,\u201d the script says as Dany watches the hug.\n\nRead more: How \u2018A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u2019 set Dany up as a tragic figure on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\n\nAfter Jaime knights Brienne, the script says she\u2019s \u201cin love with\u201d him.\n\ncaption Brienne was knighted on season eight, episode two, \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d source HBO\n\nIn the script, Brienne\u2019s knighting scene is imbued with a lot of varying emotions from the characters in the room. After Brienne tries to tell Tormund she doesn\u2019t even want to be a knight, writer Bryan Cogman\u2019s script notes that \u201cPod looks askance at her, because he knows this is patently untrue.\u201d\n\nThen Cogman indicates that Jaime sees this look exchanged between Brienne and Pod.\n\n\u201cHe looks at Brienne. Tormund\u2019s right. F\u2014 tradition,\u201d the script says.\n\nThat\u2019s when Jaime\u2019s dialogue kicks in, and he convinces Brienne to come and kneel before him so he can knight her. Afterwards, the script\u2019s stage directions say Brienne \u201csits down and looks at Jaime.\u201d\n\n\u201cDammit. She\u2019s in love with him,\u201d the script reads.\n\nOn the actual episode, the scene ends with Brienne still standing and smiling as the room of men applaud her. But the love she and Jaime feel for one another in the moment is palpable nonetheless.\n\nDuring the mini Night\u2019s Watch reunion on the battlements, the scene originally included a little moment of remembrance for how much Rast sucked.\n\ncaption Ghost, Sam, Edd, and Jon Snow together in Winterfell. source HBO\n\nJust before the battle, Sam reminisces about where he, Jon, and Edd all started. Then he mentions their fallen brothers in black \u2013 Grenn and Pyp.\n\nIn the script, Jon replies and mentions Rast \u2013 one of the Night\u2019s Watch men who tormented Sam and mutinied against Lord Commander Mormont. He was eventually killed by Ghost at Craster\u2019s Keep.\n\n\u201cF\u2014 Rast,\u201d Sam would have replied.\n\nThe final version of the episode just skips over Rast altogether, instead leaving the moment as a small tribute to Grenn and Pyp (who died during the Battle of Castle Black at the end of season four).\n\nThere was a small line from Beric cut for the final episode, perhaps because of its implications for Jon Snow.\n\ncaption Richard Dormer as Beric Dondarrion on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nThe night before the battle, on \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Sandor Clegane and Beric sat together on the walls of Winterfell. There\u2019s a small scene in the script that never made it into the final episode.\n\nWhen the Hound tells Beric to get some sleep, the Lightning Lord replies: \u201cHaven\u2019t slept since the first time I died. No point starting now.\u201d\n\nBoth Jon Snow and Beric were resurrected using magic from the Lord of Light. If Beric says he hasn\u2019t slept since he first died and was brought back to life, this would likely be true of Jon Snow, too.\n\nOur best guess for this line getting axed by the final episode is that it raises too many logistical questions about the rest of Jon\u2019s life.\n\nDuring the \u201cJenny of Oldstones\u201d montage, Bran was going to get his own little moment.\n\ncaption Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark. source HBO\n\nTowards the end of \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Podrick Payne sings a song called \u201cJenny of Oldstones\u201d and the episode cuts to a montage of all the various characters on the eve of battle.\n\nThe episode created the montage almost exactly as it was written out in the script, but with one omission: Bran Stark, the future King of Westeros.\n\nThe scripts originally said we\u2019d see \u201cBran sitting in his chambers\u201d during the montage \u201cawake\u201d and \u201calone.\u201d\n\nWhile a very small thing to drop, this would have been an opportunity to highlight Bran as an important character during this tumultuous time in the kingdom, especially given that the series ends with him as the primary ruler of the country.\n\nThe script shows cut moments which would have explained what Bran was doing during \u201cThe Long Night.\u201d\n\ncaption Bran Stark using his skinchanging powers on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source HBO\n\nA commonly asked question after \u201cThe Long Night\u201d was, \u201cWhat exactly was Bran doing?\u201d\n\nAfter Bran\u2019s eyes go white when he skinchanges in the godswood, the script says we were going to see \u201ca massive flock of ravens, bigger than last time [episode 705], converge on Winterfell from all sides, all piloted by Bran.\u201d\n\nThen, from the ravens\u2019 point-of-view, Bran would have seen Jon Snow on Rhaegal nearby, and also Daenerys off in the distance on Drogon.\n\nBran was effectively helping scout the location of all the troops during the battle. Or at least that\u2019s what the script makes it seem like he\u2019s doing.\n\nInstead, the show\u2019s version goes from Bran skingchanging to the ravens flying by the Night King, and then never returned to other vantage points to indicate how Bran was tracking the ongoing battle in Winterfell.\n\nSeveral miscellaneous characters have names in the scripts, even if we never hear them on the episode.\n\ncaption A little Winterfell girl, Ser Davos, and Gilly on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source HBO\n\nThe young girl with burn marks on her face (who reminded Ser Davos and Gilly of little Shireen Baratheon) is named \u201cTeela.\u201d\n\nOne of the wights who attacks and injures Arya during the Battle of Winterfell is called \u201cBertram\u201d in the script.\n\nAnd the massive giant who kills Lyanna Mormont is called \u201cCrum.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a man named \u201cFergus\u201d in the script. He\u2019s the one who gets soup from Ser Davos on \u201cA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d lamenting about not being a soldier. In the script for \u201cThe Long Night,\u201d Fergus is mentioned a couple more times as we were supposed to see him next to Davos when the battle began, and then later on fighting.\n\nThe script had clear directions for the camera to not focus on Arya\u2019s Valyrian steel dagger when we first see her on \u201cThe Long Night.\u201d\n\ncaption Arya used the Valyrian dagger to kill the Night King. source HBO\n\nArya\u2019s slaying of the Night King was something Benioff and Weiss wanted audiences to be very surprised by.\n\nKeeping this in mind, they noted in the script for \u201cThe Long Night\u201d that she should be wearing the Valyrian blade at her waist before the battle begins, but director Miguel Sapochnik was meant to keep things subtle.\n\n\u201cThe valyrian steel dagger is in Arya\u2019s belt, but we do not call special attention to it,\u201d the script says.\n\nRead more: The final season of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 was doomed to be divisive, and the Night King twist shows why\n\nJaime felt \u201clike a traitor\u201d after he slept with Brienne for the first time.\n\ncaption Jaime and Brienne together in bed on \u201cThe Last of the Starks.\u201d source HBO\n\nOn the fourth episode of the season, \u201cThe Last of the Starks,\u201d Jaime and Brienne have sex for the first time.\n\nThere\u2019s a wordless shot of Brienne sleeping soundly in their shared bed, while Jaime lays awake.\n\nHere\u2019s what the description in the script says of this scene: \u201cBrienne sleeps the sleep of the happily drunk and devirginized. Jaime can\u2019t sleep, however. He just helped save the world. So why does he feel like a traitor?\u201d\n\nBy the end of the episode, Jaime leaves Brienne to return south and be with Cersei in her final moments \u2013 a narrative choice which left many fans with whiplash over losing the almost-happy couple just as they got together.\n\nRead more: \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 composer Ramin Djawadi confirms fan theory about Brienne, Jaime, and the \u2018wedding\u2019 music heard on the series finale\n\nIn a removed scene, Tyrion and Jon explicitly talked about how Dany might not let people surrender in King\u2019s Landing.\n\ncaption Peter Dinklage and Kit Harington as Tyrion and Jon on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d source HBO\n\nOn the fifth episode of the season, \u201cThe Bells,\u201d Tyrion and Jon talk briefly before the battle for King\u2019s Landing starts. The final version of the episode only shows Tyrion reminding Jon that the bells mean surrender. But the script\u2019s longer version of this scene has them discuss the innocent people in the city.\n\n\u201cA million people live in that city,\u201d Tyrion says to Jon.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he replies.\n\n\u201cIf you hear the bells ring, they\u2019ve surrendered, \u201d Tyrion says. \u201cCall off your men.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s letting anyone surrender today,\u201d Jon says.\n\n\u201cWe have to try,\u201d Tyrion replies. \u201cHow many children are in there? She\u2019s not her father.\u201d\n\nThen the script indicates that \u201cJon nods, unconvinced.\u201d The aired version of this scene is shortened down to just Tyrion\u2019s line about the bells, and then a cut to Jon\u2019s barely noticeable nod.\n\nThe script also reveals what Dany was thinking just before she decided to burn down King\u2019s Landing.\n\ncaption Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen on \u201cThe Bells.\u201d source HBO\n\nThis scene had no dialogue in both the script or the final episode. Instead, actress Emilia Clarke was given stage directions for Dany\u2019s mindset.\n\nThe script says Dany looks down and see Lannister red mixed in among the people of the city, and knows she has won.\n\n\u201cBut she sees the Red Keep,\u201d the script continues. \u201cThe castle that her family built, that belongs to her. Occupied by the False Queen. She has come so far and she will go further. Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained. Drogon takes to the sky.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cblood will out\u201d line is a quote from a Robert Frost poem titled \u201cThe Flood.\u201d\n\nRead our full analysis of this section of the script and why the Frost poem is significant to learn more.\n\n\u201cThe Bells\u201d was originally going to end with Jaime and Cersei\u2019s death, not the scene with Arya and a horse.\n\ncaption Arya and the white horse at the end of \u201cThe Bells.\u201d source Helen Sloan/HBO\n\nArya finding the horse was originally meant to be her \u201cescape\u201d from King\u2019s Landing, not a slow and poetic end to the episode. Instead, the script shows the episode ending with the ceiling collapsing on Jaime and Cersei.\n\nThe slow-motion scene between Arya and the horse sparked a lot of discussion about the animal\u2019s significance and potential symbolism. But it turns out it was only ever supposed to be a way Arya could quickly leave the city.\n\nThe episode\u2019s director, Miguel Sapochnik, was likely the one who thought ending on Arya\u2019s emotional survival was the better final note.\n\nIn the script for both \u201cThe Bells\u201d and \u201cThe Iron Throne,\u201d Benioff and Weiss use several real-world wars and tragedies as comparisons for the battle in King\u2019s Landing.\n\ncaption Tyrion walking over Cersei\u2019s map of Westeros on the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series finale, \u201cThe Iron Throne.\u201d source HBO\n\nWhen the smallfolk are trying to get into the walled city for shelter on \u201cThe Bells,\u201d the script says \u201cthey shout like the throngs outside of the US Embassy during the Fall of Saigon.\u201d\n\nLater, when Arya is stumbling through the streets and trying to avoid Drogon\u2019s fire or falling buildings, the wrote that \u201cit\u2019s like being on the ground during the bombing of Dresden.\u201d\n\nOn the series finale, Tyrion walks through the city and the script says the scene should remind audiences of a 2015 movie about the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cWe follow him, \u2018Son of Saul\u2019 style, tight on his face as he passes through the gates, \u201c\n\nTyrion is also described in the script as passing by \u201chuman silhouettes on the dragon-scorched ground where ashes have blown away, the negative image of Hiroshima silhouettes.\u201c\n\nThe script also adds explanation about Jaime and Cersei\u2019s deaths that is missing from the episode.\n\ncaption The bodies of Jaime and Cersei as seen on \u201cThe Iron Throne.\u201d source HBO\n\nOn \u201cThe Bells,\u201d Jaime and Cersei find themselves trapped in the lower dungeons beneath the Red Keep. The ceiling caves in, leading to their deaths. But when Tyrion found their bodies on \u201cThe Iron Throne\u201d episode, there were clear patches of ground nearby.\n\nThis led some watchers to believe, based on this background detail, that all Jaime and Cersei had to do to survive was just stand in a different part of the room.\n\nIn the original script for \u201cThe Bells\u201d and \u201cThe Iron Throne,\u201d it says the room was overrun with flames in addition to the crumbling ceiling.\n\n\u201cAll of the skulls have been blackened and scorched by the extreme heat of the fires that raged for hours,\u201d the script says when Tyrion finds their bodies.\n\nThis little detail would have closed up the loophole of Jaime and Cersei\u2019s survival for some fans had it been left in the show.\n\nThe script evokes a statue of the Virgin Mary and Christ for Dany\u2019s death scene.\n\ncaption Jon Snow holding Dany\u2019s body in his arms on \u201cThe Iron Throne.\u201d source HBO\n\nAfter Jon kills Daenerys in the throne room, the script says she \u201clies dead, Pieta-style, as the snow drifts down.\u201d\n\nThe Pieta is a famous sculpture made by Michelangelo around 1500.\n\ncaption This Marble sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarroti sits in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City, Italy. source Leemage/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe statue shows the Virgin Mary holding the body of Christ after his crucifixion. The choice of motif is an interesting one, since it places Daenerys in the role of Christ following her death. But earlier in the script, when Daenerys is addressing her soldiers, Benioff and Weiss refer to her as \u201cSatanic Majesty.\u201d\n\nThe contradicting analogies are not explained further in the script.", "description": "Business Insider - We read all six of the scripts for HBO's hit fantasy series located at the Writer's Guild Foundation Library in Los Angeles and uncovered new facts..
