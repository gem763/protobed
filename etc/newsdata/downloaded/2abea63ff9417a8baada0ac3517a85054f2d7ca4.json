Q4 of 2018 was the worst 4th quarter since the Great Depression, but even that quarter didn\u2019t start off this badly. Given that the Fed is out of ammo, how will it keep the house of cards from toppling this time?\u201d\n\nThe investor noted that despite the cut in the benchmark interest rate by the Fed in September and growing hopes for additional cuts heading into 2020, the effect of easy monetary policy is dwindling over time.\n\nSchiff emphasized that despite the Fed\u2019s claim of not initiating quantitative easing (i.e., printing money), its balance sheet expanded by upwards of $88.1 billion.\n\nHistorically, the initiation of quantitative easing and the expansion of the balance sheet of the Fed has led to a stock market rally as it generally contributes to a short term increase in demand in the markets.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the U.S. stock market as shown by major stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, has performed poorly, decreasing the likelihood of a strong recovery by the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cThe Fed claims its not doing QE, but last week it\u2019s balance sheet expanded by $88.1B. It\u2019s grown by $176B in the past 3 weeks. During QE3 at most the Fed\u2019s balance grew by $85B per month. So the Fed is buying more than twice as much debt when it\u2019s not doing QE than when it was!,\u201d said Schiff.\n\nWill further rate cuts be ineffective?\n\nWhile the European Central Bank (ECB) is under scrutiny for its extra loose monetary policy, the government of India has also cut the nation\u2019s benchmark interest rate by another 25 basis points.\n\nAs most of the largest economies continue to move forwards accommodating near-zero interest rates, the Fed is likely to be pressured to maintain low interest rates, especially if geopolitical risks continue to build without a trade deal in sight.\n\nAt this point, with Deutsche Bank and other major banks predicting three more cuts by the first quarter of 2020, it remains uncertain whether further cuts are already priced into the stock market.\n\nInvestors like Schiff have said that more rate cuts are unlikely to revive the previous momentum of the stock market in the medium term.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Stock-market.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
