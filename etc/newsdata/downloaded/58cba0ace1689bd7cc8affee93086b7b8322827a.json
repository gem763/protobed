It\u2019s also probably the garment on your body most often, which means it\u2019s worth knowing which brands are making the best versions \u2014 not an easy feat when there\u2019s a variety of different weaves (flannel, terry, velour, waffle) and a surprisingly wide range of cuts (shawl collar, kimono, hooded) to choose from. So we asked a few women who would know, including spa owners and staffers, and makers of bath products and apparel.\n\nThe best classic robe\n\nFrette Milano Terry Bathrobe Frette is technically a textiles company, but it\u2019s more accurate to call it a luxury company. Founded in France in the 1800s and currently operating out of Italy, Frette makes high-end sheets, towels, and crucially, bathrobes. These are the kinds of soft, oversize robes that swaddle you. They can run up to $500, but that\u2019s not necessary: Dinah Cooke, who directs social media for the Joanna Vargas spa in New York and Los Angeles, swears by her simple shawl-collar Frette. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely in love with mine. It\u2019s luxurious yet simple,\u201d she says. \u201cI wear it after taking a long bath or while I\u2019m sheet-masking.\u201d $150 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nThe best organic robe\n\nCoyuchi Relaxed Linen Robe Since founding Pursoma, a line of fancy bath soaks, Shannon Vaughn has become one of the leaders of the bath-evangelist movement. \u201cI consider it the most sacred part of the day,\u201d says Vaughn, who\u2019s adding robes to her product line in the fall. In the meantime, she\u2019s a fan of the heavyweight washed-linen robe from Northern California\u2013based Coyuchi, which also makes organic sheets. For Vaughn, the brand\u2019s commitment to organic products is the main draw. \u201cI want everything that touches my skin to be as close to nature as possible,\u201d she says. After a soak, Vaughn recommends wrapping yourself in one for 30 minutes, then promptly heading straight to bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll sleep like a baby,\u201d she says. $149 at Coyuchi Buy\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: The Coyuchi robe recommended here is currently unavailable; more Coyuchi robes can be found on Amazon.]\n\nCoyuchi Organic Waffle Robe Another organic option: Coyuchi also makes a waffle robe that\u2019s considerably less, at $100. $98 at Coyuchi Buy\n\nThe best lightweight bamboo robe\n\nAgatinia Kimono Robe Ask any spa professional, and they\u2019ll likely talk your ear off about bamboo cotton fiber, a relatively new textile that boasts moisture-wicking and odor-elimination properties (two qualities that come in handy if you plan on using your robe in a steam or sauna, or just for an extra few days between laundry cycles). Rescue Spa, the Philadelphia and New York spa that inspires mad loyalty among customers, sources the kimono-cut versions it uses from Agatinia, a brand that hand-makes ecoconscious lingerie and robe products in Poland. $195 at Rescue Spa Buy\n\nNatori Shangri-La Robe This robe from Natori doesn\u2019t use bamboo fibers (which aren\u2019t that prevalent quite yet), but Natori is a tried-and-true staple for bathwear, and this robe cuts a very similar silhouette. $98 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nThe best thick bamboo robe\n\nSunlighten Bamboo Carbon Robe The staff at Higher Dose, the New York infrared-sauna spa chain, swears by a fluffier, shawl-collar bamboo-fiber option from Australian sauna manufacturer Sunlighten. \u201cThe small management team here and myself all use them. They\u2019re the best because they\u2019re soft, ecofriendly, and affordable,\u201d says Richelle Oslinker, director of customer experience at Higher Dose. \u201cI love using mine after the sauna or at home after a shower.\u201d $98 at Sunlighten Buy\n\nCariloha Ultra-Plush Bamboo Robe If you\u2019ve seen or heard of bamboo robes, it might be because of Cariloha, the other brand currently making plush, thicker robes out of bamboo. Cariloha also makes sheet and T-shirts and other homewares, but this robe feels like the most luxurious way to wear its bamboo. $120 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nThe best robe with a hood\n\nHanro Terry Long Hooded Robe The 130-year-old Swiss company Hanro is mostly known for its second-skin underwear (Strat has written about Hanro\u2019s long underwear before), but also makes buttery-soft bathrobes made from a cotton-poly blend. These are one of the brand\u2019s better-kept secrets. Melody McCloskey, founder of spa booking service StyleSeat, recommends this one and says \u201cit makes you feel like you\u2019re wrapped up in a cloud.\u201d From $89 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nHanro Cotton Robe Hanro also makes some classic robe styles with shawl collars instead of the hood. From $118 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nThe best kimono\n\nSusannah Cotton Kimono Jane Diokas, co-owner of bath product line Jane, Inc., stocks up on cotton kimono robes from Etsy shop Susana, Inc. \u201cPerhaps because we live across the Bay from San Francisco, we\u2019ve been inspired by Japanese design,\u201d Diokas says. \u201cI like kimonos and yukatas because they\u2019re elegant while still being comfortable and washable. You won\u2019t mind getting caught in your robe while wearing one.\u201d $74 at Etsy Buy\n\nThe best robes from start-ups\n\nParachute Classic Bathrobe The Strategist loves Parachute\u2019s plush mattress topper, and the direct-to-consumer bedding company also makes a bathrobe out of Turkish cotton that\u2019s Oeko-Tex certified (meaning it\u2019s free of harmful bleach or dye). \u201cIt\u2019s not the thickest robe I\u2019ve ever tried, but it\u2019s somehow the warmest,\u201d says Heather Pearson, founder of Portland vegan apparel company Dande and the Lion. \u201cAnd, the fit is perfect. I wear a size small and the sleeve length is so perfect, it\u2019s almost as if I had it custom-made. It hits right below my knees.\u201d It\u2019s been something of a viral hit: At its peak, Parachute\u2019s waiting list for the bathrobe was 1,900 people long. But it\u2019s available now, for a cool $99. $99 at Parachute Buy\n\nSnowe Bathrobe Snowe, another bedding upstart that has gotten a shout-out here for its excellent sheets, makes a hypoallergenic and quick-drying robe. According to its manufacturers, it\u2019s four times as durable as traditional towels. Cyndi Ramirez-Fulton, founder of Chillhouse spa on the Lower East Side, is such a fan of Snowe\u2019s that she owns two. \u201cI wear mine after I shower every day,\u201d she says. \u201cThe price is palatable, and I hate when I wear a robe at a hotel that doesn\u2019t actually dry me off \u2014 this one does.\u201d $98 at Snowe Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
