There were 64 members present Wednesday morning.\n\nJason Saine, a Republican, made the motion to review the budget shortly before 9am and Mr Moore dismissed objections from the Democrats present.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This is a travesty of the process, and you know it,\" Deb Butler, a Democrat, yelled before the vote began. \"Mr Speaker, how dare you, Mr Speaker!\"\n\nMary Belk, a Democrat, said at a news conference that Moore \"kept talking over us. He turned off our mics,\" AP reported.\n\nIn a tweet shortly after the override, Democratic state Senator Jeff Jackson called Republicans' behaviour \"plainly unethical.\"\n\nAs Moore threatened to have Ms Butler removed from the chamber, her Democratic colleagues surrounded her to prevent her arrest, according to video of the confrontation.\n\nMs Butler told Moore he would have to answer to the people of North Carolina.\n\n\"It's a great day for North Carolina,\" Mr Moore told the local TV outlet CBS 17.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "While most North Carolinians were remembering the lives lost on September\u00a011, 2001, the Republican leaders in the General Assembly took advantage of a half-empty House and voted to override the governor's budget veto Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/07/david-lewis-north-carolina-republicans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
