It Really Did Work", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Gun industry advertisements play on the weaknesses of troubled young men, persuading them that their perceived grievances could be remedied if they possessed the latest assault weapons. The deeply troubled 20-year-old Adam Lanza used a semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle \u2014 advertised under the slogan \u201cConsider Your Man Card Reissued\u201d \u2014 to kill 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. No other industry is allowed to act so recklessly without facing legal challenge. But a 2005 law immunized gun manufacturers against lawsuits for harm caused by the criminal use of firearms.\n\nThe 19-year-old killer of 17 at Parkland High School and the recent Dayton shooter possessed traits that would have disqualified them in many other countries from access to any firearm , let alone a military-style weapon. Numerous steps need to be taken if our mass shooting problem is to be effectively addressed.\n\nThere is no reason to think that this ghastly trend will abate without concerted government effort. We should enact a comprehensive federal assault weapons ban and limit on high-capacity magazines, repeal the federal immunity statute and create a more comprehensive and effective background check and red-flag system to ensure that the growing power of advanced weaponry is not readily available to dangerous individuals.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein of California, pivotal in getting the first ban through Congress, is among the many Democrats \u2014 both presidential candidates and on Capitol Hill \u2014 who are pressing to reinstate it or enact a new one. Strong majorities of Americans favor such a ban.\n\nBut President Trump and Republicans, who hold the majority in the Senate, strongly oppose this. And the N.R.A. has initiated lawsuits across the country to overturn existing state bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines . It also wants the Supreme Court \u2014 enriched by two Trump appointees \u2014 to effectively end all serious gun safety measures by inflicting an extreme interpretation of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court should heed the words of the conservative Reagan appointee Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson when the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted to uphold the Maryland assault weapons ban:\n\n\u201cTo say in the wake of so many mass shootings in so many localities across this country that the people themselves are now to be rendered newly powerless, that all they can do is stand by and watch as federal courts design their destiny \u2014 this would deliver a body blow to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe extraordinary increase in the body count from public gun massacres since the end of the federal assault weapons ban and the passage of the federal immunity statute for the gun industry has one obvious explanation: the brazen promotion and the proliferating , loosely regulated, highly profitable sales of the most desirable and effective weaponry for committing mass murder.\n\nWhile there are certainly considerable political risks in pursuing gun safety measures, if the goal is to save lives, it is time to turn in earnest to the task generations of graduating law students have been directed to undertake: \u201cthe shaping and application of those wise restraints that make men free.\u201d\n\nJohn Donohue is a law professor at Stanford Law School.
