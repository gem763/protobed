With a market cap of about $910 billion, AMZN stock is now one of the largest publicly listed companies. In the U.S. as well as in many other countries, it is the dominant online retailer. In recent years, Amazon has also expanded into other growth areas such as cloud computing where it has already become a leader.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nHowever, since early July, long-term AMZN shareholders have been somewhat concerned with the stock\u2019s price action. On July 11, Amazon stock hit an 52-week high of $2035.80. On Aug. 26, it saw a recent low of $1743.51. Currently the Amazon stock price is hovering around $1850.\n\nNow many investors are wondering if this quarter AMZN stock goes and stays over $2000, a price that has become an important resistance level.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUntil its next earnings report on Oct. 24, I expect AMZN to stay range-bound, possibly between $1750 and $1900. In other words, Amazon stock would need to show strong Q3 financial numbers that would act as catalyst to push the stock over $2,000 again. Here is why.\n\nAmazon Stock\u2019s Unimpressive Q2 Earnings\n\nIn July, when Amazon reported earnings for its second fiscal quarter of 2019 , it missed on the bottom line as it warned profits would disappoint in Q3, too. Amazon stock\u2019s EPS in the quarter was $5.22, compared to the forecast EPS of $5.56.\n\nThe retail giant beat analysts\u2019 average revenue estimate by a small amount. Its Q2 revenue came at $63.4 billion. Wall Street was looking for $62.5 billion. In Q2 2018, Amazon had posted $52.9 billion in sales.\n\nAmazon stock\u2019s revenue comes from five main segments:\n\nRetail Products (about 65% of its revenues)\n\nRetail Third-Party Sellers (about 12% of its revenues)\n\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS (about 15% of its revenues)\n\nSubscriptions such as Amazon Prime (about 5% of its revenues)\n\nOther, such as credit card agreements and advertising (about 3% of its revenues)\n\nDuring the quarter, Amazon\u2019s U.S. sales increased by 17% to $35.8 billion. The group\u2019s international sales grew by 9% to $16.2 billion.\n\nAmazon stock\u2019s AWS segment is the growth driver operating at high margins. The group especially uses the cash generated from AWS to fund the growth in other segments.\n\nWall Street noted that Subscriptions, which mainly constitute Amazon Prime members, were up 37% to $4.7 billion.\n\nInvestors noted that the group\u2019s renewed investments into the company are paying off as sales increased. However, this sales growth is coming at the expense of lower profit margins.\n\nSince the release of the quarterly results, investors have decreased growth expectations for the coming months, as partly reflected by the sharp drop in the AMZN stock price.\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street Needs to See Revenue Growth in AMZN Stock\n\nNot only has Amazon stock changed the world of e-commerce, but the company has been disrupting how consumer shop overall. Yet, these earnings results show that the revenue growth of Amazon\u2019s online store, third-party sellers, and subscriptions has been decelerating.\n\nFurthermore, AWS, or Amazon\u2019s cloud business, reported its slowest growth rate in several years. Its AWS revenue hit $8.4 billion. However, the consensus estimate was for $8.5 billion. In Q2 2018, the unit revenue had been $6.1 billion. Investors were especially concerned that the growth in AWS is not offsetting the top-line declines of other segments.\n\nOver the past few years, revenue and operating profits of AWS have grown extremely quickly. However, its mouth-watering operating margins have also attracted serious competition from other tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, and Alibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) cloud operations have become important competitors.\n\nGoing forward, Amazon expects its investments to increase, another factor that will negatively affect its bottom line and potentially Amazon stock in the near future. The company is expected to invest heavily in its advertising business, Prime Video, international growth, shipping, and logistics.", "description": "Over the past decade, Wall Street has witnessed the meteoric rise of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
