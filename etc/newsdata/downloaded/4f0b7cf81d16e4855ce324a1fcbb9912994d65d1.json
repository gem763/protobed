There was also an agreement to preserve biodiversity.\n\nWorld leaders gathered in 1992 for the first Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The conference spearheaded many of today\u2019s international environmental agreements. (United Nations)\n\nParallel to the Rio meeting was an event in Costa Rica called \"Youth '92\", where thousands of young people from around the world gathered to talk about their future on planet Earth. I was there as host of a kids' science show called Wonderstruck.\n\nThe meeting was fuelled by the boundless energy of youth who were ready to take on the big issues of smog choking cities, water pollution clogging rivers and the destruction of rainforests for beef production. (Sound familiar?) There was a strong resolve to change political will and take on the corporate giants who were placing the economy above the environment. As a group, the youth felt they had a strong voice because they were the future.\n\n27 years of broken promises\n\nOf course, politicians at the time were happy to make bold claims of solidarity with the young voices, with pledges to change environmental laws and move forward into a cleaner, sustainable world. Sadly, few of those promises were fulfilled. The year 2000 came and went and the target of reducing emissions to 1990 levels was not met.\n\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon speaks the United Nations during the Entry into Force of the Paris Agreement September 21, 2016, at the United Nations in New York.

In 1992, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere was 356 parts per million. Now, it is above 400, a level that some scientists believe is near or past the point of no return. In other words, the voice of youth was unable to move governments and big industry to implement real change.\n\nWill things be different this time?\n\nNow the youth are speaking out again. Will they succeed this time?\n\n16-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg has inspired a wave of climate protests by schoolchildren around the world after delivering a fiery speech at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, last year.

As the global average temperature continues to rise, droughts and forest fires are more common, ice caps are melting at unprecedented rates. In fact, in many cases, the effects of climate change are happening faster than predicted. When it comes to biodiversity, the situation is also bleak, with species disappearing at a rate that some scientists think signifies planet's sixth major extinction event.\n\nAll of this has young people deeply concerned because this is the world they are inheriting, so they are crying out for action.\n\nPerhaps this time, the rest of us should stand beside them for support.", "description": "27 years ago, young people got together to advocate for climate action.
