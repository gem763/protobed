We will be best served over the long term by resisting this urge and defending free expression.\u201d\n\nStill, Zuckerberg failed to delineate between freedom of expression, and freedom of paid amplification of that expression which inherently favors the rich.\n\nDuring today\u2019s Q3 2019 earnings call where Facebook beat expectations and grew monthly users 2% to 2.45 billion, Zuckerberg spent his time defending the social network\u2019s lenient political ad policy. You can read his full prepared statement here.\n\nOne clear objective was to dispel the idea that Facebook was motivated by greed to keep these ads. Zuckerberg explained \u201cWe estimate these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our revenue next year.\u201d For reference, Facebook earned $66 billion in the 12 months ending Q3 2019, so Facebook might earn around $330 million to $400 million in political ads next year. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unclear if Zuckerberg meant 0.5% of ads were political or just from politicians without counting issue ads and PACs.\n\nZuckerberg also said that given Facebook removed 50 million hours per day of viral video watching from its platform to support well-being which hurt ad viewership and the company\u2019s share price, Facebook clearly doesn\u2019t act solely in pursuit of profit.\n\nWe just shared our community update and quarterly results. Here\u2019s what I said on our earnings call. \u2014 Before we\u2026 Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday, October 30, 2019\n\nFacebook\u2019s CEO also tried to bat down the theory that Facebook is allowing misinformation in political ads to cater to conservatives or avoid calls of bias from them. \u201cSome people say that this is just all a cynical political calculation and that we\u2019re acting in a way that we don\u2019t really believe because we\u2019re just trying to appease conservatives\u201d he said, responding that \u201cfrankly, if our goal was that we\u2019re trying to make either side happy then we\u2019re not doing a very good job because I\u2019m pretty sure everyone is frustrated.\u201d\n\nInstead of banning political ads, Zuckerberg voiced support for increasing transparency about how ads look, how much is spent on them, and where they\u2019re run. \u201cI believe that the better approach is to work to increase transparency. Ads on Facebook are already more transparent than anywhere else. We have a political ads archive so anyone can scrutinize every ad that\u2019s run.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned that political ads are run by \u201cGoogle, YouTube, and most internet platforms\u201d, seeming to stumble for a second as he was likely prepared to cite Twitter too until it announced it would drop all political ads an hour earlier. He omitted that Pinterest and TikTok have also banned political ads.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that hundreds of Facebook\u2019s own employees have called on their CEO to change the policy. He concluded that no one could accuse Facebook of not deeply thinking through the question and its downstream ramifications. Zuckerberg did leave himself an out if he chooses to change the policy, though. \u201cI\u2019ve considered whether we should not [sell political ads] in the past, and I\u2019ll continue to do so.\u201d\n\nDorsey had tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought.\u201d Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed support for Twitter\u2019s move while Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale called it \u201ca very dumb decision\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s CEO took some clear swipes at Zuckerberg, countering his common arguments for allowing misinformation in politician\u2019s ads. \u201cSome might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\u201d Given President Trump had outspent all Democratic candidates on Facebook ads as of March of this year, it\u2019s clear that deep-pocketed incumbents could benefit from Facebook\u2019s policy.\n\nMiming Facebook\u2019s position, Dorsey tweeted \u201cIt\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want!\u201d\n\nTwitter doesn\u2019t earn much from political ads, citing only $3 million in revenue from the 2018 mid-term elections, or roughly 0.1% of its $3 billion in total 2018 revenue. That means there will be no major windfall for Facebook from Twitter dropping political ads. But now all eyes will be on Facebook and Google/YouTube. If Sundar Pichai and Susan Wojcicki move in line with Dorsey, it could make Zuckerberg even more vulnerable to criticism.\n\n$330 million might not be a big incentive for Facebook or Zuckerberg, but it still sounds like a lot of money to earn from ads that potentially lie to voters. I respect Facebook\u2019s lenient policy when it comes to speech organically posted to users, organizations, or politicians\u2019 own accounts. But relying on the candidates, press, and public to police speech is dangerously idealistic. We\u2019ve seen how candidates will do anything to win, partisan press will ignore the truth to support their team, and the public aren\u2019t educated or engaged enough to consistently understand what\u2019s false.\n\nZuckerberg greatest mistakes have come from overestimating humanity. Unfortunately, not everyone wants to bring the world closer together. Without safeguards, Facebook\u2019s tools can help tear it apart. It\u2019s time for Facebook and Zuckerberg to recognize the difference between free expression and paid expression.", "description": "As Jack Dorsey announced his company Twitter would drop all political ads, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg doubled-down on his policy of refusing to fact check politicians\u2019 ads. \u201cAt times of social tension there has often been an urge to pull back on free expression . . .
