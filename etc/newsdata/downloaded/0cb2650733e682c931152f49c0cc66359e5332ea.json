Starting at $649, the Pixelbook Go marks a return to the standard laptop format after last year\u2019s Pixelbook with a 180-degree hinge and the Pixel Slate 2-in-1.\n\nThe Go will come with a 16:9 13.3-inch touch screen and either an HD or 4K display, two USB-C ports, a built-in Titan-C security chip, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. It\u2019s powered by Intel Core CPUs, starting with an m3 chip at the low end and an i7 at the top end.

Ross also stressed that the Pixelbook Go has a larger battery, yet is still lighter, thanks to its magnesium body.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, with its Surface line, Google\u2019s laptops always seemed more like aspirational devices that defined the high end of the Chromebook spectrum. At $649, the Pixelbook Go is clearly more affordable than many of Google\u2019s previous efforts in this area and the company clearly hopes to sell a few more of them.", "description": "At its annual hardware event, Google today announced the launch of the Pixelbook Go, the latest iteration of its first-party Chromebook lineup.
