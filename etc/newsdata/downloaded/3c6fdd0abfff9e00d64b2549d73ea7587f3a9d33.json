Unlike some car makers that report monthly sales and break them down by region and other variables, it reports the numbers per vehicle model.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expect the company to have sold 98,000 vehicles in the third quarter, including 79,600 Model 3 sedans. Sales of its luxury Model S sedan and Model X SUV are seen at evenly split at 8,600 units each Model.\n\nThat would compare with 84,000 vehicles in the third quarter of 2018, which included about 56,000 Model 3s.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their third-quarter delivery expectations to 97,200 vehicles, from a prior forecast of 86,300 vehicles.\n\n\u201cEurope looks to be coming in stronger, particularly the Netherlands\u201d with launch of a right-hand traffic Model 3 in the U.K., the analysts, led by Joseph Spak, said in a note Thursday. Anything slightly under 100,000 would be \u201cwell received\u201d by the market, the analysts said.\n\n\n\n\u201cLike last quarter, we are more focused on the 3Q19 financial report which may again show tension between volume and profit,\u201d they said.\n\nSee also: Tesla Model 3 earns top safety award from insurance group\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush were less sanguine about Tesla\u2019s hitting sales expectations.\n\n\u201cBased on the US demand and improved European trajectory, coupled by pockets of weakness in China, we believe Tesla will come up shy of Street expectations with an (88,000 to 90,000) range more likely,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWhile unit numbers will be the ultimate driver of the stock in our opinion and have seen an encouraging rebound over the past two quarters from the 1Q debacle, Tesla has also continued to initiate cost cutting measures to help drive sustained profitability to the bottom line which is a positive move that investors are laser focused on,\u201d they said.\n\nThe \u201cbiggest overhang\u201d for Tesla is the 2019 sales guidance, the Wedbush analysts said. That\u2019s \u201cgoing to be a Herculean-like task in our opinion as (the range of about 345,000 to 350,000 vehicles sold) is likely the line in the sand as Street whisper numbers have continued to come down over the past few months,\u201d the Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, said.\n\nRelated: Beyond Meat poaches Tesla\u2019s head of solar to be new operating chief\n\nIf Tesla is able to sell 280,000 Model 3 sedans this year, that would be a success \u201cand ultimately put the company on more stable ground heading into 2020,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nTesla has said it expects to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in all of 2019. The analysts polled by FactSet expect sales of 358,000 for the year.\n\nThe 33 analysts on FactSet on average rate Tesla shares at neutral, and the average price target on the stock is $270, which would represent an upside of nearly 18% on Thursday\u2019s price.\n\nTesla is expected to report third-quarter results in early November, and the analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the company to show an adjusted loss of 42 cents a share on sales of $6.4 billion. That would contrast with an adjusted profit of $2.90 a share on sales of $6.8 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nRead more: Tesla launches its car insurance in California\n\nTesla shares have lost 31% this year, contrasting with gains of 19% and 15% for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.24% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
