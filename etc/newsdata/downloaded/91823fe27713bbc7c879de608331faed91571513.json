This month, former One Direction singer Harry Styles broke a lengthy Twitter silence when he tweeted the word \"do\" - a hint at the title of his second album.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFor Reilly, it is an effective strategy for artists because followers \"track their every single movement and read into it\".\n\n\"Drop the smallest hint of something relevant and the fans will immediately latch onto that and do deep dives into music on the horizon,\" he says.\n\n\"These kind of fandoms are following their every move.\"\n\n'Part of the fandom'\n\nPenny Andrews, a writer and researcher specialising in internet cultures, says fandoms - or subcultures of fans - foster a strong sense of community and identity among their members.\n\n\"Fan bases have always existed; you're an act and you have fans, but they're not necessarily in touch with each other,\" they say.\n\n\"Now everyone considers themselves to be part of a fandom specifically, it's a personal choice. It's not like: 'I really like Ariana Grande'. You are part of the fandom. You will comment first whenever she posts an Instagram, you will be in contact with other fans, you will create content around that.\n\n\"I suppose it's why you'd want to be a football fan as opposed to somebody who just goes and watches football.\"\n\nMembers of a fandom often group together to boost their artist's position in the charts after a song's release, just as \"street teamers\" did in the 1990s and 2000s, Andrews adds.\n\n\"You would have a 'street team' - you'd recruit of fans who would try to get other fans, and themselves, to ring up the local radio stations [and] try to make it look like there was organic demand [for the song]\".\n\nToday, fandoms coordinate streaming a single or music video in order to boost the track immediately after its release.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nRush releases\n\nThe UK singles charts began including plays on streaming services in 2014 and music video streams and downloads last year.\n\nThe rise of streaming has also encouraged artists like Selena Gomez to release music without warning, says music journalist Joe Muggs, because platforms like Spotify have blurred the lines between promotion and consumption of tracks.\n\nBefore streaming, he says, the difference was much starker.\n\n\"There would typically be a much longer lead up to new music being released, with tracks played on radio [for] a long time before the public could buy the record,\" he says.\n\nToday, artists and record labels want fans to be able to press play from the get go.\n\n\"They don't want people to listen to 'rips' of radio plays, which they can't easily monetise and monitor as they can with normal streaming plays,\" he adds.\n\nInstagram killed the radio star?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHowever, radio still matters, Muggs admits, particularly when BBC Radio 1 DJs who specialise in a particular genre premier new artists.\n\nEven for more seasoned artists, such as Coldplay, it remains a way to publicise their music.\n\nRadio 1 DJ Annie Mac will play the world exclusive of two tracks from the band's new album, Everyday Life, on Thursday evening.\n\nFrom albums to singles\n\nThere has also been a seismic shift from the prioritisation of albums to the frequent release of singles.\n\nIn the pre-internet era, there was often not long between the release of a single and the entire album.\n\nWannabe, the Spice Girls' first single, was released less than three months before their debut album, Spice, in 1996. A decade later, Amy Winehouse's hit Rehab came out as a single four days before Back to Black, her second album.\n\nFast forward to 2019, and Dermot Kennedy has only just released his debut studio album, despite releasing his first single four years ago.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIs it always New Music Friday?\n\nChart followers will also have noticed a shift to \"New Music Fridays\" over the past few years.\n\nIn the past, different countries released new music on different days of the week. In the UK, that was Mondays.\n\nHowever, in 2015 the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) announced that Friday would become the \"global record release day\".\n\nExplaining the change at the time, Edgar Berger of Sony Music Entertainment said: \"Hits can come from anywhere and spread everywhere.... now all artists will be able to reach their global fan bases on the same day.\"\n\nBut Selena Gomez and Coldplay debuting their new songs for the first time on a Thursday shows that it doesn't always go to plan. They might just be one step ahead of the game this week.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
