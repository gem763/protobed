Voters thought they had laid the issue to rest with a 2001 referendum, but calls to change the state flag came roaring back after the Charleston killings.\n\nOne by one, university presidents started rolling up the controversial banners. They said the Mississippi flag was incompatible with the diverse, inclusive community they hoped to establish on campus.\n\n\u201cThis is a painful decision in many respects because this is a highly charged emotional issue for many people,\u201d Delta State University President William N. LaForge said in November 2016 when his school became the last of the state\u2019s eight colleges to lower the Mississippi banner.\n\n\u201cBut in the absence of state action, we are making a decision I believe is right and just on all levels,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe objectionable portion of the state flag \u2014 the stars and bars \u2014 presents a polarizing symbol that is a barrier to progress and improved understanding of our state, our university, and our people.\u201d\n\nThe state flag flies over the capital in Jackson and state government buildings, but at least 30 cities and counties have joined the universities in furling the flag, said Lea Campbell, founder and president of the Mississippi Rising Coalition, a social justice group with headquarters in Ocean Springs.\n\nVoters will have another chance to speak on the issue, albeit obliquely, in November when they choose a new governor. Outgoing Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, has said any change to the flag should be put to a statewide vote and not be made by a coalition of officials in Jackson.\n\nTate Reeves, the lieutenant governor who will represent the Republican Party in the election, has the same view.\n\nHis Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jim Hood, did not respond to multiple attempts for comment but released a statement in April saying he supported changing the flag.\n\nSuch unwillingness to engage in debate on the topic is typical in state politics, The Clarion-Ledger reported that month when it took an impromptu survey of various candidates.\n\nThe protesters at the University of Southern Mississippi say politicians are dodging the issue. The No State Flag/No State Funds group noted that 65% of voters supported keeping the current flag in 2001.\n\nThat was years before Dylan Roof\u2019s racist killings in Charleston, but Mr. Barnes and others said they have no problem with another referendum.\n\nThey tried to weave the flag into the state Constitution with Initiative 62 starting in 2017, but they were never able to amass enough signatures.\n\nThe Legislature has floated various bills that would change the flag, although none has ever reached the governor\u2019s desk. A measure to fine universities that refuse to fly the flag failed in 2017.\n\nFor many weeks after beginning their protests, No State Flag/No State Funds attracted large and largely hostile crowds that pitted some faculty members, students and out-of-state activists against the pro-flag group.\n\nThe university has erected wooden barriers separating the sides, and an ongoing court case involves an anti-flag protester who sprayed pepper spray into the eyes of pro-flag demonstrator David Flynt.\n\nProtesters insist they are far from the caricature of Klansmen in which they are often depicted.\n\nStill, they make their allegiances clear. Mr. Barnes sports a \u201cMake Dixie Great Again\u201d red cap, and several of the protesters wear shirts emblazoned with some form of the Confederate symbol.\n\n\u201cNo, I do not,\u201d Mr. Barnes declared when asked whether he considered himself racist. The half-dozen others sitting under a tent on a scalding September afternoon echoed his response.\n\nThe group plants state flags of various sizes along the curb in front of them, and passing motorists sometimes honk or, as Robert Ulmer noted, present the group \u201cwith a thumbs-up or a middle finger. About 50/50.\u201d\n\nMr. Barnes is retired from 18 years of active duty in the U.S. Army, and fellow protester Jessie Sanford said the universities\u2019 decision is insulting not just to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, of which many protesters are members, but also the current military.\n\n\u201cI carried that flag when I served in Afghanistan with the Mississippi National Guard in 2011 and 2012,\u201d Mr. Sanford said. \u201cSo I think it is disrespectful to all veterans.\u201d\n\nThe Civil War hovers over the Deep South in ways unfamiliar to the rest of the nation. Hattiesburg sits in the middle of Forrest County, named after the general and KKK founder Nathan Bedford Forrest, a man so racist that he once participated the killings of wounded black U.S. soldiers on an apocalyptic Civil War battlefield in Tennessee. The state flag flies at a welcome center near Picayune over a memorial erected to \u201cthe Hancock Rebels,\u201d who eventually served under Forrest in the Confederate army.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping the issue comes up in the [gubernatorial] debate,\u201d Ms. Campbell told The Washington Times. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly calling for it to be an issue, and we believe it is one voters want to hear about.\u201d\n\nHer group, Mississippi Rising, runs the #TakeItDownMs social media campaign as well as a YouTube presentation of Mississippians talking about why they believe the flag should be changed.\n\nMs. Campbell pointed to her group\u2019s internal polling that she said showed a thin 51% majority in favor of changing the state flag for the first time in 2018.\n\nThe state does have a substitute design. The Stennis flag features one large blue star encircled by 19 smaller blue stars and flanked by red bands that represent the blood spilled by Mississippi veterans.\n\nAs the only state left in the union with the Confederate saltire, Mississippi is holding itself back economically as well as morally, Mississippi Rising says.\n\n\u201cThe Confederate emblem has been used since the Civil War to represent various groups, including the army and government of the Confederate States of America and numerous white supremacist groups, as a symbol of white supremacy,\u201d the group says. \u201cUnspeakable acts of terror and violence against African Americans, Jews, LGBT citizens, immigrants, Catholics and other minorities have been committed by these groups under the Confederate emblem, and it is unacceptable that the flag representing our state enshrines the symbol of hate and flies on tax-payer-funded public properties.\u201d\n\nTo Kimberly Craven, one of the No State Flag/No State Funds founders, the flag contains history good and bad and her alma mater should not make a unilateral decision that clashes with the will of taxpayers who keep the university afloat.\n\n\u201cI think in terms of our end goal maybe we haven\u2019t accomplished that much,\u201d Ms. Craven said. \u201cBut I think in terms of raising the issue and having people see the flag, it\u2019s been good for the community.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
