Labor sources said Mr Setka quit because he would have been expelled on Friday at a planned meeting by Labor's National Executive.\n\nMr Setka said he would stay on at the helm of the Victorian division of the CFMEU.\n\nHis ouster represents a victory for Mr Albanese whose previous inability to remove Mr Setka was undermining his leadership authority.\n\nMr Albanese, who initially had Mr Setka suspended but struggled to expel him, said he would always stand up for the rights of trade unions but so, too, would he defend the values of the Labor Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Through his actions he demonstrated values that were not consistent with the values which the Australian Labor Party holds dear,'' Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"One of those values is respect for women. The fact he has been convicted of breaching a family violence order and the fact that he was also convicted and pleaded guilty to harassment indicates that that is the case.\n\n\"There has also been a range of activity in breach of both the Victorian rules of the ALP and the values of the Australian Labor Party. \"\n\nMr Setka said Mr Albanese\u2019s \"betrayal of working Australians\" culminated last week with his support for the free trade agreements.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete betrayal of working Australians who will lose jobs to foreign workers as a result,\u201d Mr Setka said.\n\n\u201cIt was the last straw for me and a sign of just how far out of touch Mr Albanese is with our fundamental principles.\u201d\n\nMr Setka also accused Mr Albanese of failing to take up the fight on the government\u2019s Ensuring Integrity Bill which will facilitate the deregistration of rouge union officials and unions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabor vehemently opposes the bill but independent Senator Jacqui Lambie is threatening to vote for is unless Mr Setka quits the unions. She renewed that threat on Wednesday, saying Mr Setka must quit the union, not just the ALP.\n\nMr Setka said the bill would \"severely restrict workers\u2019 rights to seek fair pay and better working conditions.\n\nHe accused Mr Albanese of a smear campaign to oust him that was \"based on a lie that he denigrated family violence campaigner Rosie Batty at the national executive meeting''.\n\n\u201cMr Albanese claims I have brought the ALP into disrepute. Nothing has hurt the Labor Party\u2019s reputation like Mr Albanese\u2019s leadership over the past five months,\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. I can no longer ignore the effect this is having on my family, along with Anthony Albanese\u2019s betrayal of working Australians and the core values of the Labor Party and Union Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoving forward, I will continue to lead the CFMEU and keep fighting to deliver the best wages, conditions and safety standards for construction workers and their families anywhere in Australia.\u201d\n\nIn August, Mr Albanese vowed to continue his pursuit of Mr Setka despite a court ruling the national ALP must defer to its Victorian branch to expel the controversial union boss.\n\nMr Setka withdrew his appeal to that decision on Wednesday. The ALP National Executive was set to meet Friday to discuss his expulsion.", "description": "John Setka has resigned as a member of the ALP ending a four-month campaign\u00a0by Anthony Albanese to have him expelled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4505%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_50/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/67e54e75ae176687608f9c99a49944ff03907ae2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
