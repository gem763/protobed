Anthony Brindisi, a freshman Democrat from central New York, comes from a district that Trump won in 2016 by more than 15 percentage points. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nRep. Anthony Brindisi has held 10 town-hall meetings in his first nine months in office, an outreach tour de force that has kept the freshman Democrat in touch with voters in his sprawling central New York district.\n\nImpeachment has barely been a point of focus.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned about kitchen-table issues for the most part,\u201d Brindisi told reporters Friday as he left the Capitol. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned about their drug costs. Farmers are hurting because of trade policy and immigration policy right now.\u201d\n\nNow, as Congress heads home for a 17-day recess, lawmakers are about to find out whether that dynamic has changed.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) formally kicked off an impeachment inquiry after new revelations about President Trump exerting pressure on Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate a leading 2020 Democratic rival, putting the issue front and center in districts that might otherwise be focused on local infrastructure needs.\n\nFor months Pelosi declared that the House could \u201clegislate and investigate\u201d at the same time, but formally starting impeachment puts that to the test.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D-Tex.) said that she was still \u201cworking hard to get to yes\u201d on a new North American agreement on trade. Democrats were, she said, \u201cvery focused on continuing to do the work that we came here to do.\u201d\n\nBut impeachment has never been the most important issue of concern from constituents in her Houston-area district, which Republicans had held for decades until her upset victory in 2018. Guns have been the dominant issue.\n\nBy Tuesday, Fletcher had joined dozens of other Democratic freshmen in supporting the impeachment proceedings. \u201cWe need to be sure that we are fulfilling our constitutional duty,\u201d she said.\n\n[The speaker speaks for us now\u2019: How reluctant freshman Democrats endorsed impeachment of Trump]\n\nThis bloc of freshmen had previously told Pelosi\u2019s leadership team that the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, focused on Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible involvement of Trump campaign subordinates, was too complicated for their constituents.\n\nSeveral dozen come from districts that Trump won in 2016, like Brindisi, where the president won by more than 15 percentage points, so impeachment would also carry real risk to their own reelection bids next year. And many had won last year by steering clear of Trump scandals and promising to deliver results for their constituents.\n\nIn the spring and early summer, the topic barely came up with voters in these districts. In April, The Washington Post spent two days in the district neighboring Brindisi\u2019s, with Rep. Antonio Delgado (D), just after Mueller\u2019s report was partially released. Only one constituent mentioned the Russia investigation.\n\nIn the late summer, during a 46-day break, Democrats saw a slight uptick in constituent interest as liberal anti-Trump activists tried to press wavering lawmakers into supporting impeachment.\n\nA typical event came in late August outside Pittsburgh. Rep. Conor Lamb (D), whose 2018 victory in a special election foretold the midterm landslide, fielded 21 questions from constituents, taking three about his reluctance to support impeachment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an extremely high bar,\u201d Lamb said.\n\nSeven constituents asked about health care and four more asked about gun control, with several more asking about abortion and climate change.\n\nOn Thursday, Lamb \u2014 a former Marine and federal prosecutor \u2014 joined the calls for a formal inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nSome freshmen have deep fears that impeachment hearings will turn into a circuslike atmosphere resembling former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s appearance before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month. Such a result would only degrade what is supposed to be a constitutional clash, while also damaging the political standing of those Democrats in swing districts.\n\n\u201cThat will lead people very quickly to just making up their mind and shutting down and saying this is more of the same,\u201d said Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.). \u201cIt is clear, it is clear, right now, that this is not more of the same.\u201d\n\nRose, whose Staten Island-based district favored Trump by nearly 10 percent, has not formally voiced support for the impeachment inquiry. He said that his \u201cNorth Star\u201d is making the investigation something that is respected by people who do not live and breathe politics on cable news.\n\n\u201cThere are people right now in this country who do not know what we are talking about, who are oblivious to the issue, not because they are ignorant but just because they are busy going about their daily lives working hard, trying to make this country and their family\u2019s lives a better place,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt is our responsibility to show each of those people that we are proceeding in a forthright and responsible and deliberate manner.\u201d\n\n[In a Trump district, a freshman House Democrat works on repeating his success]\n\nEven the most stridently liberal freshman Democrats realize the stakes are higher than ever. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told reporters Friday that she wanted to embrace leadership\u2019s message to \u201ceducate the public\u201d on Trump\u2019s actions in simple ways that voters can grasp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to explain the Ukraine situation in as clear terms as possible,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez, who has pushed for months to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nLike most lawmakers, she has no impeachment-specific events planned over the recess because this all happened so fast. She expects a town hall that was meant as an issue roundup on previous events, which dealt with housing and immigration issues, to turn into a venue for discussing impeachment developments.\n\nBut, Ocasio-Cortez said, Democrats need to keep pushing their other agenda items, from lowering prescription drug costs to tightening gun legislation, and make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) feel pressure to bring up the House-passed legislation.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell has been bragging all year that he\u2019s the \u2018graveyard\u2019 for policies that pass out of the House,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not concerned about us slowing down our business here in the House.\u201d\n\nBut as they left the Capitol on Friday, Democrats did not know what awaited them back home, whether their constituents would rally behind them or just ignore all the scandal talk as just some Washington noise that didn\u2019t impact their lives.\n\nOr, as the boxer Mike Tyson used to say, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face \u2014 pro-Trump voters could storm their town halls.\n\nBrindisi said calls to his offices \u201cspiked\u201d to an \u201cabove average\u201d level of about 750 this week, and most wanted him to support impeachment. However, Trump supporters also held a large rally outside his district office.\n\nWhich side will bring bigger pressure to bear over the next two weeks?\n\n\u201cTo be determined,\u201d Brindisi said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "House freshmen, especially those in districts Trump won in 2016, are uncertain about what pressure they will face as they return home for a 17-day congressional recess.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "September At Am", "Paul Kane Is The Washington Post'S Senior Congressional Correspondent", "Columnist.
