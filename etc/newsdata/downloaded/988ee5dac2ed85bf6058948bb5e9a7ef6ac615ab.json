A Broadway veteran, she is also known for her supporting roles in TV dramas such as True Blood and Rectify. She\u2019s currently playing Gerri Kellman, general counsel to Waystar Royco, on HBO/Sky Atlantic hit Succession. Smith-Cameron is married to writer-director Kenneth Lonergan and they have a 17-year-old daughter.\n\nHow are you feeling about Succession\u2019s Emmy win for outstanding writing last weekend?\n\nI was delighted and still am, because it\u2019s so brilliantly written: bold, clever and thrilling to work on. I couldn\u2019t admire [creator and showrunner] Jesse Armstrong more.\n\nYour character, Gerri, is proving to be the cult star of season two...\n\nI don\u2019t know about that but, if so, it\u2019s delightful. I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s always having those eye-roll moments, looking down her glasses or taking a pointed sip of water, which the audience find satisfying. She\u2019s in the inner circle but slightly removed because she\u2019s not a member of the Roy family. Gerri\u2019s largely unflappable so it\u2019s fun to watch when she does react. And those reaction shots are pretty meme-friendly, as it turns out.\n\nAre you getting recognised more as the show has taken off?\n\nDefinitely. And Succession seems to have very diverse fans, which is great. I don\u2019t dress or wear my hair like Gerri, so sometimes at the end of a meal at a restaurant, the waitress will suddenly go: \u201cWait a minute, aren\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d It\u2019s often a slow dawning.\n\nWhy do you think season two is so much bigger than season one?\n\nPartly because the show very confidently took its time to set itself up. There are lots of layers to it and the style has this sort of cold objectivity. Jesse and the other writers relish the characters\u2019 foibles but don\u2019t glorify them. They show how awful they are but don\u2019t spell things out or over-explain. It\u2019s deftly done and finding that exact delicate tone took time. The audience had to hang in there but when they did crack the puzzle, it was extra-rewarding.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest J Smith-Cameron and Kieran Culkin in season two of Succession. Photograph: HBO\n\nGerri\u2019s relationship with Roman Roy, played by Kieran Culkin, has developed into something sexual. Did you see that coming?\n\nIt took me by surprise as much as viewers! In season one, when we were shooting scenes in the UK, Kieran and I did a little improv that wasn\u2019t used. They often let us do an extra, looser take or leave the camera rolling at the end of a scene. It was just jokey repartee about mixing martinis because we both, on occasion, order one then we pretended to check each other out as we walked away. I\u2019m not sure it was flirtatious but there was some little frisson between us. Everyone found it funny and that might have informed the subsequent storyline.\n\nYou and Kieran knew each other already. Did that make the intimate scenes easier?\n\nI\u2019ve known Kieran for years. He\u2019s been in several of my husband\u2019s projects and we have lots of mutual friends. It was a great luxury to have that rapport already. We knew each other\u2019s sense of humour.\n\nWhat is it that makes their relationship so fascinating?\n\nIt\u2019s unexpected and perverse. I guess the shock is part of the fun of it. But there\u2019s also this burgeoning mentor relationship which is very tender. I\u2019d venture to say that\u2019s what interests Gerri more \u2013 to be able to influence one of the Roys and form an alliance.\n\nAnd you got to coin the term \u201cslime puppy\u201d \u2026\n\nHa, yes. I think that was my improvisation. I looked back at the script and that certainly wasn\u2019t on the page. We were talking on the phone and as Roman was, shall we say, finishing, we\u2019d run out of dialogue, so I said a few different things. That one made it into the cut. It was their first time and Gerri was sort of disgusted but the more disgusted she sounded, the hotter it was for him.\n\nWhat did you make of your character when you first saw the part?\n\nIt was originally a male role, Gerry with a Y. When I first auditioned, they\u2019d just decided to call women in to read for it, too. I stumbled across this idea that Gerri was someone who\u2019d wince and give withering glances. I also figured she\u2019d been with the business a long time, so had to be a survivor. Someone who could step around booby traps and perform under pressure.\n\nWell, Roman said she\u2019s \u201ca stone-cold, killer bitch\u201d.\n\nHe\u2019s such a flirt! He says that admiringly because Gerri is quite a badass. She\u2019s a high-stakes player but also relatable because she\u2019s unnerved at times. Sometimes she\u2019s just trying to stay on the surfboard. That makes her interesting.\n\nThis week\u2019s episode is filmed in Scotland again. How was that?\n\nWe had a blast. We got to shoot in the new V&A in Dundee, which is very cool-looking.\n\nIn your mind, are the Roy family a take on the Trumps, the Murdochs or someone else?\n\nAn amalgamation. I think the writers artfully pick and choose qualities they\u2019ve observed from all these families and their power structures. It\u2019s partly about what life is like if you\u2019re super-rich with that much power. But to be a junior family member under someone like that is weirdly powerless \u2013 they have the trappings of this great life yet they\u2019re frustrated by their impotence.\n\nIn Succession, women often seem the smartest ones in the room. Might they eventually take over from the men?\n\nThat would be interesting. It\u2019s certainly a growing theme: that the men are hotheads, while the women are capable of being more measured. I have no idea in grand terms where the story is going but that\u2019s one possible direction.\n\nWhich actor is the least like their character?\n\nMatthew Macfadyen for sure. Matthew himself is decorous, well-read and charming \u2013 but his character Tom is such a doofus.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite role in your career so far?\n\nOh gee. Well, I love this one but outside of Succession, I adored Juno and the Paycock in the off-Broadway production. My part in Rectify was fascinating because she was so repressed. And I loved my role in my husband\u2019s movie Margaret, which was incredibly multifaceted \u2013 and Kieran Culkin was in it too, which brings us full circle.\n\nYour Twitter game is excellent. Is it a chance to show your political side?\n\nI suppose so. I was bashful to begin with, then Brexit and our election happened. I felt like everybody suddenly had to become political to some degree. Maybe it was too little too late but it was time to find a voice and connect with people. The global community felt in danger and it felt like social media could be used for good. It\u2019s also fun. There are a lot of witty people on Twitter.\n\nWhat makes you happy when you\u2019re not working?\n\nI\u2019m a big bookworm and love to read. I like baseball. I\u2019m currently looking at colleges with my daughter too, which is gratifying.\n\nYou should dress as Gerri when you visit the colleges.\n\nGood idea! I might command some respect.\n\nSuccession season 2 continues on Sky Atlantic and Now TV", "description": "The actor talks about Jesse Armstrong\u2019s hit drama, sex scenes with Kieran Culkin and getting political on Twitter", "authors": ["Michael Hogan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb3518a748d01b571f48b096dde66cd652ba2705/0_156_4560_2736/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff1fb9e2c30b4fc0135f17e4b1d66299", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
