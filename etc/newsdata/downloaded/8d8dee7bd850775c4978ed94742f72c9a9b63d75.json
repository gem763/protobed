The real problem is that highly publicized fake hate crimes like this one usually receive little public coverage after it is revealed that the original accusation was a hoax.\n\nThen, too, few Americans are aware that in just the past few years, several children have been caught fabricating hate-crime allegations.\n\nIn January 2017, police in Gambrills, Maryland, identified a \u201c14-year-old black female\u201d as the suspect responsible for sending out a violent racist threat against her high school using a Twitter account pretending to be part of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe following month, students at Plano West Senior High in Texas discovered their school vandalized with racist, anti-black graffiti all over its buildings and school vans. After several months, police arrested and charged Alexandria Monet Butler and Elizabeth Joy Police, two black female minors, for the incident. They were caught on camera vandalizing the school.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Ngo", "Nypost.Com Why-We-Keep-Falling-For-Hate-Crime-Hoaxes"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
