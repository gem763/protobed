He converted to Islam about 10 years ago.\n\nTraore did not say if he would go ahead with the event despite the ban, but said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that he was free as a French citizen to hold such demonstrations.\n\n\u201cIn France, we have the freedom to demonstrate. In France, the police are there to protect the whole of the population,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "France is banning a planned demonstration that triggered outrage from politicians who saw it as honoring the attacker who killed four people in the Paris police headquarters last week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
