You turn it on and it pummels you with 40 pounds of thumping percussive pressure, wherever you aim it.\n\nThe Theragun is designed for \u201cmuscle pain relief, performance enhancement, and faster recovery,\u201d per its literature, and it\u2019s been around since 2016, so readers may already be familiar. (According to Men\u2019s Health, Theraguns are \u201cproliferating.\u201d The NBA\u2019s Kyrie Irving and the NFL\u2019s Antonio Brown are apparently fans, and a competitor, the Hypervolt, is popular among Crazy Ex-Girlfriend cast members.) The latest Theragun model, the G3, which is what I\u2019ve been trying, looks a bit like a sleek, gigantic geometric vibrator. But it\u2019s definitely not a sex toy (from the warnings section: \u201cDo not use the G3 on your head or near your genitals\u201d), and the pleasure it brings is decidedly unsexual.\n\nFloating it (drilling it) into my thigh put me into a weird trance, where it felt like my eyes were rolling back into my head, and I felt like a cat being petted. The instructions call wielding the Theragun \u201cfloating\u201d (as in, \u201cfloat the Theragun on the palms of your hands \u2026\u201d), presumably because \u201cfloating\u201d sounds better than shooting, pummeling, zapping, punching, or drilling. But all of those things were how it felt, in a pleasant, numbing way. Shortly after the Theragun arrived, I brought it around the office to show some co-workers. One noted that it looked like a hand mixer, although most agreed that it looked sexual. One ran it \u2014 sorry, floated it \u2014 over her forearm with a weird look on her face.\n\nThe G3 is billed as the quietest Theragun model yet, although it was still loud enough that when I tested it at my desk, colleagues told me that they could hear me using it from 40 feet away. (One Amazon reviewer noted that its predecessor, the G2, was so loud \u201cthat in a normal gym environment, everyone will stop whatever they\u2019re doing and look at you.\u201d In the Amazon listing for the G2PRO, which is no longer available, Theragun writes: \u201cWe have heard your feedback that the G2PRO is too loud for many users.\u201d) Both the Theragun G3 and G3PRO have 4.5-star average reviews on Amazon, with users noting \u201cdecreased soreness\u201d and \u201ctension relief,\u201d although some still note the noise (\u201csounds like a power tool\u201d). The PRO comes with more attachments, has an adjustable arm, pummels with 20 pounds more force, and costs $200 more.\n\nDesigned by a chiropractor recovering from a motorcycle injury, the Theragun claims to be energizing, pain-relieving, tension-relieving, and performance-enhancing. I can\u2019t speak to any of those, exactly, although I can confirm that it is fun and funny. It\u2019s also about as heavy and wieldable as a drill (it\u2019s a little under three pounds), or maybe an ergonomic staple gun. (The longer I have it, the more I wonder if it\u2019s too intense. I know I\u2019m not supposed to use it on my head, but if I did, would it jiggle my thoughts away? At one point, I floated it high enough up my thigh that I sort of felt like I had to pee \u2026 Also, pregnant users are encouraged to consult a physician before use.) As one pain-management specialist told the Strategist last year, about the G2 model, \u201call it is is just a more sophisticated massage device.\u201d Also: \u201cFor some people [looking to use a massage device], just using a rolling pin might help, and a rolling pin is certainly much less expensive than this.\u201d\n\nIf you do feel like spending $399 on a loud, health-goth hand mixer for your body \u2014 or you\u2019ve been in a motorcycle accident, or you\u2019ve got colleagues to confuse, annoy, and intrigue \u2014 or you\u2019re interested in maybe punishing a loved one in the form of a massage (I can see it), then the Theragun may be for you. My initial infatuation has worn off, and I now have a white one that\u2019s up for grabs.", "description": "The Theragun is a percussive pain-relieving machine that puts you into a trance.
