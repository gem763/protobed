Evidence, however, showed he had in fact travelled in a police vehicle.\n\nMapyane also claimed travelling costs for attending a court case in Pretoria. It was, however, revealed that he was not subpoenaed to be there.\n\nThe investigation came about after a whistleblower in the Nelspruit branch of the Hawks spilled the beans.\n\nThe then-Mpumalanga police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thulani Ntobela, led the investigation and arrested Mapyane on May 22, 2010.\n\nAfter his arrest, Mapyane had a few run-ins with his employer when he was suspended while a disciplinary hearing was conducted. He refused to vacate his office and only did so after members of his unit held a sit-in.\n\nMapyane was fired after being found guilty at the disciplinary hearing.\n\nIn February this year, Nelspruit Regional Court magistrate Vanessa Joubert found Mapyane guilty on five charges of fraud and corruption.\n\nOn Friday, Joubert ruled that Mapyane should pay R5 000 for each conviction. She also sentenced him to two-year wholly suspended jail terms for each count on condition that he immediately pay his fine.", "description": "The former head of the Hawks in Mpumalanga, Major General Simon Mapyane, has been slapped with a R25 000 fine after he was found guilty on five charges of fraud and corruption.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8713/35fe0efd30e24aa1b8e51e8c6f46b087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
