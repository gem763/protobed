The sentiment has gone and the last wish my sons have done for their grandad has been disrespected.\"\n\n(Image: Argus/Sussex News and Pictures)\n\nThe tribute was part of \u00a31,000 worth of flowers ordered from the florist.\n\nThey also included a Bertie Bassett design because Frederick, who lived at Preston Circus, Brighton, loved licorice.\n\nThe family paid \u00a3120 for the remote design but said it looked terrible.\n\nBut the florist said if they had wanted more detail they could have had a \u00a3200 version.\n\nWhen the remote arrived at the funeral at Woodvale, the arrangement was upside down.\n\nThe florist agreed that in this position, it bore a resemblance to a flip-flop and said it apologised on that basis.\n\nBut a member of staff said: \"The remote control arrangement shows an accurate shape of a Sky control - note the curvature on the top right.\n\n(Image: Argus/Sussex News and Pictures)\n\n\"It includes the black trim of a Sky control, grey sprayed flowers as the base, black sprayed flowers to represent some of the buttons, pale blue sprayed flowers to be representative of the larger buttons and red, green, yellow and blue single flowers to represent the additional function buttons.\n\n\"If placed upside down, as happened at the service, the coloured flowers could give the impression of strap of a flip-flop.\n\n\"Also, with the arrangement on a green base, when upside down, this further adds to the view it could be a flip-flop on grass.\"\n\nMs Rushin said: \"If you stand next to it with a picture of the TV remote it has some resemblance but it's not obvious.\n\n\"It was just awful.\n\n\"We were thinking about having the actual TV remote in the coffin with him.\"", "description": "Jilly Rushin was disappointed saying the flowers looked more like a flip flop than a \"dibber\" at TV lover Frederick Bowles' funeral", "authors": ["Martyn Hale", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Argus Sussex News", "Pictures"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647499.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Funeral-tribute-looks-like-flip-flop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
