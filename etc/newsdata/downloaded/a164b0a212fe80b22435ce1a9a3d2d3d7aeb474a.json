Armed with his camera, he and his friends would pile into his mom\u2019s car at 3 AM every Saturday night to make the 40-minute drive to the industrial part of the city. It was the early 90s, and young people were gathering to dance at DIY parties in abandoned warehouses, their bodies lit by lasers as the electrobeats pumped in the background until the sun came up. When the music was over, they would spill into the car parks, where Simon would capture the scene on film \u2014 kids in baggy denim, shrunken thrift store sweaters, and FILA sneakers coming down from the highs of the night.\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember as clear as yesterday that shooting these pictures was something amazing. I didn\u2019t know what focus, depth of field, f-stop, or shutter speed was... I just felt I needed to photograph it,\u201d said Simon to i-D, over the phone from his home in upstate New York.\n\nNow, nearly 30 years later, the 44-year-old has compiled his photos, personal diary entries, and old fliers for \u201893: Punching the Light, a book that offers an intimate look at a year in his life as a young raver in the short-lived underground scene.\n\nTo find out more about those long nights and how his book captures the ecstasy of being a teen, we called up Simon ahead of the worldwide book launch.\n\n\n\nHow did you get into photography?\n\nI left my old school in the area I grew up in. I had a bit of an attitude problem. I wasn\u2019t a bad kid or anything. I just wasn\u2019t challenged. So my mom and dad were like, \u201cWe got money aside for you if you want to look at other options.\u201d It was hard to make friends because I was a weekly boarder. So I decided to do art. My art teacher asked me, \u201cCan you paint?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cCan you draw?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what do you do?\" I said, \u201cI take pictures of my mates.\u201d He said, \u201cGreat, here is some film. Go take pictures.\u201d\n\nSo then you started photographing the raves?\n\nRaves were the subculture, or the subject matter that I wanted to photograph. I really loved them and they were so much fun. Everyone looked so cool because it was quite a process. We\u2019d all go out and buy the biggest and baddest pairs of denim flares and these silly little polyester shirts that stank and were horrible and the old man cardigans with the pockets. It was all a scene with the hats and baggy jeans and FILA shoes.\n\nWhat was it like being a young raver in Sydney at that time?\n\nIt was just a whole thing that went under the radar. No one knew about it, unless you knew about it. It was such a diverse, little world. It was around for a very small window from 89-94. It really kicked off in 91, which is the year I started. I don\u2019t think it could happen now. It\u2019s a shame, but I just don\u2019t think it is possible.\n\nWhat was a typical weekend like?\n\nEveryone would come over to my house and get dressed and drive there at 4 AM. The security would have left or at least they were charging $5 instead of $25, which back then to a 17-year-old was a lot of money. We would stay up and dance for hours. Mom and dad knew, but they weren\u2019t thrilled. It was a really special period.\n\nDid you always shoot in the morning?\n\nI didn\u2019t want to feel like I was exposing the situation or abruptly shooting people, where it was like, \u201ca flash just went off in my face, it\u2019s 7 AM.\u201d When I was shooting there was always available light. The camera always came out in the morning. The morning was so special because you just went through the ups and downs of the party, but mainly the ups.\n\nWhat did you like about the car parks?\n\nThe car parks were so interesting because it was where people connected again. It was where you hung out and there were multiple stereos playing out the back of the cars. People had parties there, so I wanted to make it more about that, opposed to the hacienda typical rave pictures. I wanted it to be about the community. I really felt like I was an insider rather than an outsider photographing something.\n\nCan you tell me more about the diary entries that are sprinkled throughout the book? Some of them aren't even specifically about the raves, like the one about your new haircut?\n\nIt was really a challenge because I had to filter through them. That one about my haircut? What the hell was I thinking? The fact that I wrote that baffles me. I didn\u2019t want to talk all about the drugs, because it wasn\u2019t all about the drugs, it was about connection and people. That\u2019s adolescence. I wanted to make it about the struggles and ecstasy of being 16 and 17.\n\nWhat inspired you to put the book out now?\n\nThere were pictures I stumbled upon on a hard drive, and it was the classic ones during that period that I loved. I just thought I should look at this again because we are knocking on the door of the 90s being cool again. This was three years ago and the fashion wasn\u2019t anywhere near what it is now. You can look at the book and think it\u2019s from now. Visually, I thought this was going to come back in style. And for a decade, this stuff was just sitting in my room at my mom and dad's house on a shelf in a bag.\n\nI didn\u2019t think it would be as challenging. You forget the actual emotional level of going through this stuff. I found it very difficult\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from the book?\n\nI want someone who is young and learning about life to look at it and say I completely relate to this.\n\nA worldwide book launch and book signing with Simon will be hosted at 98 Orchard Street in New York on Oct. 17 from 6-10 PM, followed by an after-party from 10 PM-4 AM at Good Room in Greenpoint.", "description": "Photographer Simon Burstall's book '93: Punching the Light' offers an intimate look at being a young raver in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da8912482eff7000a229432/social_lede/1571339348856-Rave-split-photo.png?crop=1xw:0.9304xh;0xw,0.0296xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
