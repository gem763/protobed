The event includes autograph signings between games and merchandise sales.\n\nPWHPA president Jayna Hefford says weekend passes are almost sold out, and single-game tickets are still available.\n\n\"People need to show up if they want to support women's hockey,\" the Hockey Hall of Famer said.\n\nGames aren't on television, but CBC will livestream games on its digital platforms (beginning Saturday at 12:30 p.m. ET), as will the PWHPA on its YouTube channel.\n\nIn addition to Toronto's showcase, other PWHPA players will take on Boston College's women Saturday in Chestnut Hill, Mass., followed by another game Sunday in San Jose's SAP Centre against NHL Sharks alumni.\n\nKendall Coyne Schofield headlines San Jose stop\n\nKendall Coyne Schofield is the PWHPA headliner in San Jose, where the American forward set the hockey world abuzz with her speed lap during the NHL all-star game's skills competition in January.\n\nFour-game showcases are also scheduled for Oct. 5-6 in Hudson, N.H., and Oct. 18-20 in Chicago.\n\nMore Canadian events will be announced at a later date, says Hefford.\n\nToronto's Westwood is a multi-icepad community centre.\n\nWATCH | Kendall Coyne Schofield makes history at NHL Skills Competition:\n\nThe American made history on Friday by becoming the 1st female to compete in the NHL's Skills Competition when she raced around the ice in the Faster Skater competition. 1:11\n\nIt's an intimate venue where boys and girls in minor hockey can interact with some of the world's best female players, Hefford points out.\n\n\"This is a great way to stay connected to the grassroots level,\" she said.\n\n\"If we were doing one game, absolutely I'd say let's do a 5,000-seat rink or more. But when you're trying to do four games, that's a huge endeavour.\n\n\"Down the road we want to be playing in these professional buildings, but this movement is about the grassroots and the community-engagement piece.\"\n\nA veteran Canadian Women's Hockey League goaltender and advocate of women's pro hockey, Liz Knox from Stouffville, Ont., is now working with the PWHPA.\n\nShe was involved in organizing Toronto's tour stop.\n\n\"It's really a unique opportunity to see 100 of the best players in the world play against each other and see some line combinations you wouldn't normally see at a rivalry series or at the Olympics,\" Knox said.\n\nPWHPA players refuse to join the U.S.-based, five-team NWHL starting its fifth season.\n\n'We're looking to create something much bigger'\n\nThe CWHL announced it was shutting down earlier this year after 12 seasons.\n\nMany women want the NHL to get involved in running a league like the NBA does with the WNBA.\n\nBut commissioner Gary Bettman has said the NHL doesn't want to interfere while a women's league is operating.\n\nThe PWHPA's tour will compete with the NWHL for eyeballs and money at times this season.\n\nBut those involved in the Dream Gap Tour stop short of declaring the demise of the NWHL is their goal.\n\n\"I don't think that's ever been a box on our list,\" Knox said. \"In our conversations early on in the season, they didn't provide us with the answers we wanted to consider it a viable option.\n\n\"They're on the same path as the CWHL was and we saw that does not work. We saw there were limitations to that from a business standpoint, from a sponsorship standpoint.\"\n\nSaid Poulin: \"They're doing their thing. We believe in our product and we believe in the model we want and we're not so comfortable in their model.\"\n\nHefford, from Kingston, Ont., says the PWHPA doesn't want to \"put anyone out of business.\"\n\n\"We're looking to create something much bigger and a more long-term solution for women's hockey than what any of us see right now,\" she said.", "description": "The roughly 200 hockey players who formed the Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association (PWHPA) begin deploying in the tour's inaugural events Saturday and Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290593.1568931474!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/poulin-marie-philip.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
