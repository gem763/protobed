I knew it would be difficult, but I have a fighting position and I am going to give it everything.\n\n\"Red Bull look very quick on the long runs and I think it will be about seeing if their tyres last - that is going to be the name of the game in this race. I am really looking forward to the fight.\"", "description": "World champion elect Lewis Hamilton said he was looking forward to an exciting fight despite qualifying back in fourth for the Mexican Grand Prix.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9524/557b0d3b9607455bb473a22366277797.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
