Revolution of our age!\u201d\n\nInven Global, a website that covers esports and gaming news, reports that Blitzchung shouted the phrase in Chinese. Blitzchung is from Hong Kong, according to Inven Global. A clip of the interview can be seen here.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The company said Blitzchung has been removed from the Grandmasters roster, and will not receive any prize money he earned during the Grandmasters season 2 tournament. According to a statement from Blizzard, Blitzchung violated a competition rule that bars players from doing anything that \u201cbrings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\nBlitzchung lost $10,000 in prize earnings, Bloomberg reports. In a statement to Inven Global, Blitzchung said he viewed his comments as a continuation of his participation in the protests.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there are serious protests in my country now. My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention,\u201d he said. \u201cI put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn\u2019t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue.\u201d\n\nBlizzard is the latest American organization trying to quell support for the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong out of an apparent fear of retaliation from the Chinese government, which has insisted that Hong Kong and Taiwan be referred to as its territories, and not as their own countries. Just this week, China\u2019s state television banned broadcasts of preseason NBA games after a now-deleted tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey expressed support for the Hong Kong protestors.\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "Blizzard Entertainment has banned Hearthstone player Ng Wai Chung for expressing support for Hong Kong protestors.", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/blizzard-entertainment-hong-kong-blitzchung.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
