Why should reaction to the Times\u2019s new smear of Brett Kavanaugh be any different?\n\nI don\u2019t know what Pressley\u2019s angle is here but Harris\u2019s is plain as day. The bottom has fallen out of her primary polling; she left the top tier weeks ago and is on the cusp of also-ran status. Just as Beto needed an issue through which to communicate his passion for the progressive agenda and found it in gun confiscation, hoping to leverage the excitement into new polling momentum, Harris is going to try to harness the left\u2019s hatred of Kavanaugh and ride it back into double digits. Kavanaugh\u2019s also a good topic for her insofar as the closest she\u2019s come as a senator to igniting meaningful grassroots enthusiasm was when she grilled him at his confirmation hearings last year. The more she can position herself as his chief inquisitor, the better it\u2019ll be.\n\nIn theory. Beto\u2019s numbers haven\u2019t twitched since he called for a mandatory buyback of assault rifles last Thursday night. This Kavanaugh play is unlikely to do much for Harris either, especially since Elizabeth Warren has kept pace with her in calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. But she has to try something.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris is asking House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler to form an outside task force to investigate the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and whether he lied to Congress during his testimony, according to a letter first given to Axios\u2026 \u201cI understand that the House Judiciary Committee has limited resources and many other responsibilities,\u201d Harris writes in her letter. \u201cHowever, in the past, congressional committees have dedicated resources and established structures to pursue serious cases of misconduct \u2014 including by creating a task force and retaining outside counsel to help lead impeachment inquiries.\u201d\u2026 Harris is asking the committee\u2019s task force to investigate four questions, relating to the FBI\u2019s previous investigation into Kavanaugh; whether he lied during his Senate confirmation process; and to gather more information about the alleged sexual assault from various witnesses like Kavanaugh\u2019s former Yale roommate and the 25 witnesses provided by Deborah Ramirez.\n\nDoes this mean Harris is backing off her hasty demand from over the weekend that Kavanaugh be impeached because of the Times piece? It\u2019s sporting of a former California AG to allow the accused the benefit of an investigation before removing him from the federal bench over an allegation of sexual misconduct which the supposed victim herself doesn\u2019t recall.\n\nThe whole thing seems oddly desperate. I mean, realistically how bad could Harris\u2019s polling b\u2014 [record scratch]\n\n7% in California in 4th place. Must have been the crowdsurfing. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d pic.twitter.com/eImHDZsGee \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 17, 2019\n\nAs for Pressley, rumors have kicked around for the past few months that she might take a shot at a Senate seat in Massachusetts if Elizabeth Warren ends up getting elected president and a vacancy opens up. (Trump\u2019s decision to pick a fight with Pressley and the rest of \u201cthe Squad\u201d can only help her in indigo-blue Massachusetts.) Pushing hard on Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment might be her way of pandering to Massachusetts primary voters in advance. But we shouldn\u2019t overthink it either: What distinguishes the Squad from the rest of the Democratic caucus is their maximalist approach to most things, an ostentatious willingness to fight from the safety of their very blue districts in contrast to more timid centrist purple-district Dems. AOC also called for impeaching Kavanaugh yesterday, remember. For her and Pressley, there may be no \u201cangle\u201d here beyond simply protecting their brand by dashing into battle against right-wing villains whenever one presents himself.\n\n\u201cI believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,\u201d said Pressley in a statement today announcing that she intends to introduce a resolution that would open an impeachment investigation of Kavanaugh. Will Pelosi go for it, though? What about Jerry Nadler? All signs point to no:\n\n\u201cGet real,\u201d as Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) put it Monday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get beyond this \u2018impeachment is the answer to every problem.\u2019 It\u2019s not realistic,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cIf that\u2019s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we\u2019re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.\u201d\u2026 House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler similarly dismissed the idea of an impeachment inquiry, arguing in a radio interview Monday that the committee is \u201cconcentrating our resources on determining whether to impeach the president.\u201d The New York Democrat said it\u2019s one thing for progressives to call for impeachment but for him \u201cit\u2019s a consequential action, which we have to be able to justify.\u201d\n\nHence Harris\u2019s call for having the House Judiciary Committee appoint an outside task force to investigate Kavanaugh. She knew Nadler would try to duck this by claiming that he has his hands full at the moment. And why wouldn\u2019t he? How would Democrats possibly go about proving that Kavanaugh assaulted Deborah Ramirez to a degree of certainty sufficient to justify removing him from the Court? Any inquiry is destined to end in failure \u2014 in the House, not the Senate, as centrist Dems defect and decide they\u2019re not signing up for something that\u2019s apt to unite Republicans more than it will Democrats.\n\nThe only wrinkle is this Axios piece from yesterday claiming that Democrats are \u2014 or were \u2014 planning to make Kavanaugh a key figure in their election pitch next year. We need to rid ourselves of these rule-breaking Republicans, they\u2019re planning to say, citing Trump, McConnell, and the newest Court justice. If that\u2019s true, why are Pelosi and Nadler lukewarm about an impeachment investigation? The investigation of Kavanaugh doesn\u2019t need to go anywhere, just like their investigation of Trump isn\u2019t going anywhere. The point of the Trump investigation is essentially PR, keeping the idea of presidential corruption fresh in the public\u2019s mind and using the Judiciary Committee\u2019s subpoena power to stockpile dirt on the president. They could do the same on Kavanaugh and never actually call an impeachment vote. I think that\u2019s what Harris has in mind. Why would Pelosi resist when she\u2019s supporting the same strategy against Trump?\n\nHere\u2019s Scarborough this morning wondering why a former state attorney general seems so eager to hang a man professionally for a crime which the alleged victim says never happened.", "description": "Whatever.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kh-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
