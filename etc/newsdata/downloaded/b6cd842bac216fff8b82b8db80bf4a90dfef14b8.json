In an unusually undiplomatic broadside against his Brazilian counterpart, he concluded that Bolsonaro \"lied to him\" about the Mercosur pact when it was struck in June, by promising to respect the Paris Climate Agreement and to protect the rainforest, an Elys\u00e9e official said.\n\nIf France doesn't sign up to the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, it is dead.\n\nPutting deforestation onto the G7 agenda could well put Macron on a collision course with Donald Trump in Biarritz. The U.S. president will be far keener to focus on a French digital tax that he thinks penalizes U.S. tech companies. Trump also has a far more cordial relationship with Bolsonaro and is also eyeing a trade deal with him.\n\nThe accord needs to be ratified by EU governments, the European Parliament and some 40 other parliaments across Europe.\n\nWhen the EU-Mercosur deal was concluded at a political level in June, Macron hailed it as a \"good deal\" but warned of the need for vigilance on the environmental fall-out. Bolsonaro has subsequently startled the international community by accusing foreign environmental activists of being behind the fires. He argues that foreigners should not be interfering in Brazilian sovereignty.\n\n\"Bolsonaro\u2019s inaction on fires, and his response by talking of manipulation and instrumentalization when the fires are highlighted, has made his inaction more visible and tangible,\" the Elys\u00e9e official said. \"That\u2019s why, as things stand, we are opposed to the Mercosur [deal]. We are being coherent.\"\n\nUnraveling deal\n\nThe French comments raise very serious doubts over the EU's deal with Mercosur (comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The accord needs to be ratified by EU governments, the European Parliament and some 40 other parliaments across Europe.\n\nMassive forest fires have destroyed trees in the Amazon at record pace this year, with Brazil\u2019s space agency reporting its satellite data showed an 84 percent increase in fires over the same period in 2018. The NGO Amazon Watch suggested Thursday that many fires had been lit by farmers wanting to clear the land.\n\nMacron's opposition came hard on the heels of comments by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who vowed Friday his country would not ratify the Mercosur deal \"if Brazil does not honor its environmental commitments.\" He said the idea that foreign non-governmental organizations were behind the fires was \"Orwellian.\"\n\nThe Mercosur deal has proved especially politically toxic in both France and Ireland because both countries have important beef farming constituencies that feel threatened by waves of cheap imports from Brazil and Argentina.\n\nFinland's Finance Minister Mika Lintil\u00e4 \u2014 whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency \u2014 also said Friday that \"the EU and Finland are urgently exploring the possibility of banning imports of Brazilian beef.\"\n\nLintil\u00e4 added that he wanted to discuss the issue with his EU colleagues at a meeting in Helsinki in mid-September.\n\nA German government spokesperson, however, said Friday that Berlin opposes Macron\u2019s threatened block, stressing that such a step is \u201cnot the appropriate response\u201d to fires raging in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn a televised address late Friday, Bolsonaro vowed to take \u201cfirm action\u201d against the blazes and pledged to mobilize the army to support firefighters. Responding indirectly to Macron\u2019s threat, he said: \u201cForest fires exist in the whole world and this cannot serve as a pretext for possible international sanctions.\u201d\n\nTrump fallout\n\nMacron seized the political initiative in a tweet on Thursday night when he called the Amazon fires \"an international crisis\" and vowed to \"discuss this emergency first order\" at the G7 summit, which he will host from Saturday to Monday in the upscale coastal resort of Biarritz.\n\nEuropean threats to block the Mercosur deal could offer an opening to Trump, however. In July he said he wanted to do his own tariff-slashing trade deal with Brazil. If Macron snubs Bolsonaro, the Brazilian leader could quickly turn to Trump, who is demanding fewer environmental conditions.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva on Friday directly acknowledged that risk over Brazil's strategic direction: \"We have seen that the American president is trying to convince other words leaders to join him in rejecting the Paris Agreement,\" she said.\n\n\"With the EU-Mercosur agreement, Brazilian President Bolsonaro has made his choice, he has come with us,\" Andreeva went on, adding that the deal was \"a way ... to push and encourage each other to live up to the commitments we have made together.\"\n\nBolsonaro, meanwhile, protested against Macron's proposal to make the Amazon fire a priority at the summit of the G7, where Brazil will not be in attendance.\n\n\"The French president's suggestion that Amazonian issues be discussed at the G7 without the participation of the countries of the region evokes a colonialist mentality that is out of place in the 21st century,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
