The Bulldogs are looking to rebound from their own late collapse.\n\nMississippi State (2-1) is riding a four-game home winning streak against Kentucky heading into Saturday\u2019s Southeastern Conference opener against the Wildcats (2-1, 0-1 SEC). MSU has dominated Kentucky, winning eight of their last 10 meetings.\n\nThere has been no shortage of clanging cowbells in one of college football\u2019s most hostile environments.\n\n\u201cI know our kids are energized and galvanized and excited for a great home field advantage that (our fans) are going to provide,\u201d MSU coach Joe Moorhead said. \u201cWe understand that this one game isn\u2019t going to define the season, but we\u2019re excited to get back on the field.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs outgained Kansas State 352-269 and led 24-17 early in the fourth before yielding a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and the game-winning TD with 5:37 remaining. Having shown it can start strong, the priority this week is finishing Kentucky if given the chance.\n\nThe Wildcats come in with the same approach.\n\nThey appeared headed to a 3-0 start and two-game winning streak against No. 9 Florida with a 21-10 lead late in the third quarter. The Gators rallied with three TDs in the fourth to hand Kentucky a 29-21 loss in its SEC opener.\n\nKentucky has quickly tried to move past that disappointing loss and looks to start over in Starkville - a quest that starts with blocking out the noise.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be great road challenges throughout the year and this is our first opportunity, and we have to embrace that,\u201d said Kentucky coach Mark Stoops, whose team is mastering silent counts to counter the cowbells.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s fun in the challenge of going on the road, being united and playing in Starkville. We\u2019ll be excited about that opportunity.\u201d\n\nSome other things to watch as Kentucky visits Mississippi State:\n\nSMITH\u2019S GROWTH\n\nWildcats QB Sawyer Smith completed his first nine passes and seemed headed toward a huge day accounting for all three touchdowns and 267 yards passing against Florida. He also ran down a Florida defender to make a touchdown-saving tackle after an interception, one of three picks in the contest with two leading to 10 points including the go-ahead TD. Kentucky coaches are stressing better poise by Smith but have hinted at giving him more responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process, and we have to make sure we keep it tight,\u201d quarterbacks coach Darin Hinshaw said of the packages. \u201cBut we also understand that we can expand and do more things with him.\u201d\n\nBULLDOGS PLAYMAKER\n\nMSU running back Kylin Hill leads the SEC in rushing with 431 yards, which also ranks second in FBS. The junior\u2019s total includes 15 runs of 10-plus yards, which leads the nation and has helped MSU rank fourth in SEC rushing at 224 yards per game. Hill hasn\u2019t lost a fumble in 260 career carries.\n\nSIDELINED\n\nInjuries to tackle Phil Hoskins and safety Taj Dodson, and a first-half suspension for T.J. Carter may leave Kentucky\u2019s defense short-handed. Hoskins was expected to debut last week after missing the first two contests because of an academic issue but did not play after hurting his knee during pregame warmups. He is questionable along with Dodson, whose injury wasn\u2019t specified. Carter was ejected for targeting and must sit out the first half.\n\nMSU QUARTERBACK QUESTIONS\n\nThe depth chart lists graduate transfer Tommy Stevens as the Bulldogs\u2019 starting QB, with either freshman Garrett Schrader or junior Keytaon Thompson as his backup. Stevens was lifted in the second half last week with shoulder stiffness and has been evaluated daily. Schrader, who led a 79-yard TD drive in relief of Stevens, is ready just in case and appears to be the choice over Thompson, who\u2019s recovering from an upper body injury sustained in camp.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball , https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 , and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast/id1138957862?mt=2\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kentucky hopes a change of scenery can reverse its fortunes after losing a close game last week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary B.
