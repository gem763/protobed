Adam Schiff (D-CA) the \"biggest leaker\" in Washington, D.C. as the reason why he did not inform Congressional Democrats about the weekend raid that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n\"Well, I guess the only thing is they were talking about why didn\u2019t I give the information to Adam Schiff and his committee? And the answer is because I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington. You know that, I know that, we all know that,\" Trump told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"I\u2019ve watched Adam Schiff leak. He\u2019s a corrupt politician. He\u2019s a leaker like nobody\u2019s ever seen before,\" he added.\n\nIn her statement about the successful raid, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Trump should have informed members of Congress.\n\n\"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region. Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\"\n\nThere were no U.S. casualties during the raid, with only a military working dog sustaining minor injuries when al-Baghdadi blew up a suicide vest when he realized he could not escape.\n\nAccording to Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, al-Baghdadi's remains have already been buried at sea.\n\nSource tells me Abu Bakr al Baghdadi remains have already been buried at sea. \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 28, 2019\n\nSchiff is leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump over the phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he asked the country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over allegations of corruption in exchange for military aid.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:18:43PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/280/b8a2fc66-5fdd-4dc7-8cf5-60d58e7eb599.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
