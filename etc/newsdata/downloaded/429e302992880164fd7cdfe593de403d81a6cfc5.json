He said he would \"propose a written procedure\", thus negating the need for another summit meeting.\n\nThe BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said most of the people in EU circles she had spoken to were tempted to grant the extension to 31 January laid out in the so-called Benn Act - the law aimed at preventing no-deal.\n\nUnder that law, Mr Johnson wrote to the EU to ask for a three-month extension on Saturday, but did not sign the letter and said it was Parliament and not the government that had requested the delay.\n\nHowever, BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said an EU source had indicated the bloc was also considering a \"flextension\" - an extension with a maximum end date, but with the flexibility for the UK to leave early if a deal was ratified sooner.\n\n'Give it another go'\n\nFormer cabinet minister David Lidington said he expected the EU would grant an extension \"to make sure that they don't get the blame\" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Conservative MP told the Today programme the government should give the programme motion \"another go\" with an amended timetable, after asking the Labour Party how long its MPs needed to scrutinise the bill.\n\nMr Lidington said garnering support for an amended programme motion would reduce the chance of a general election, which would in part be favourable because: \"I don't think the public will welcome an election in the run-up to Christmas.\"\n\nGermany's Die Welt newspaper sums up EU thoughts on Brexit this morning with the headline: \"The only thing that is clear is that Brexit is not happening on 31 October.\"\n\nEU leaders must now agree on whether to grant the UK another Brexit extension and if so: how long for?\n\nDon't forget every country has a veto on this. But after speaking extensively to EU diplomats and politicians, the consensus EU-side seems to be to say yes.\n\nThe EU's decision is expected by the end of the week, but you can expect a lot of EU grumbling beforehand. France's Europe minister was unsurprisingly (France has settled into role of \"Brexit bad cop\") one of first to speak on the record last night.\n\nShe noted that time alone wouldn't solve the UK's Brexit conundrum and she said the EU would want to hear UK's justification for another extension - i.e. what will be done with the time?\n\nEU leaders are fully aware the PM's hand was forced by Parliament to request a three-month extension. Brussels does not want to get embroiled in heated UK debate, so it seems most likely it will say yes to that rather than \"impose\" their own \"EU extension\".\n\nRead more from the BBC's Europe editor.\n\nBefore Tuesday's votes, Mr Johnson had threatened to pull the whole bill and call for a general election if the timetable motion was lost.\n\nBut the prime minister cannot force an election himself and would need the backing of Parliament.\n\nOpposition MPs have previously ruled out holding one until the prospect of no-deal was off the table.\n\nHowever, the BBC's chief political correspondent, Vicki Young, said the Liberal Democrats would be likely to back an election if a three-month extension was agreed.\n\nAnd BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said SNP sources said they would also agree in this scenario.\n\nTory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said he thought the EU would grant such an extension.\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Newsnight, he said if this happened there would be \"no excuses\" for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn not to back an election.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: MPs have \"refused to be bounced\"\n\nFollowing Tuesday's votes, Mr Corbyn said his party was prepared to work with the government to agree \"a reasonable timetable\" to enable the Commons to debate and scrutinise the Brexit legislation properly.\n\n\"That would be the sensible way forward, and that's the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight,\" he said.\n\nHis offer potentially opens the way for Parliament to approve the bill before the end of the year.\n\nBut it also opens up increased opportunities for MPs to seek to amend the legislation in ways the government would find unacceptable - such as by including a customs union or second referendum.\n\nStephen Kinnock, a Labour MP who supports Brexit but did not vote for Mr Johnson's deal, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday that the likelihood of the bill securing the support of MPs would increase if the government gave Parliament longer to scrutinise it and make amendments.\n\nHe said MPs and the government must \"rediscover the lost art of compromise\".\n\nThere is a tension in the Tory party today - some would rather try again to get the bill through. Those MPs were cock-a-hoop at the fact they had managed to get 19 Labour MPs to cross the threshold to potentially back this kind of Brexit deal - even though that is a million miles away from it getting safe passage through Parliament.\n\nBut in the heart in Downing Street the instinct is: if a delay is agreed they throw everything into an election instead.\n\nNo 10's fear is, even if they say \"maybe we could pass the bill in a fortnight,\" that delay might turn into a long one, tangling with Parliament and losing control of the timetable.\n\nJust as Parliament doesn't trust the prime minister, the prime minister and his team don't trust Parliament.\n\nOpposition parties have no interest really in helping Boris Johnson to complete the passage of this bill. They want to disrupt it for perfectly obvious and legitimate political reasons.\n\nSo as things stand, the prime minister would rather trigger an election... But it is not in his gift.\n\nRead more from the BBC's political editor.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf an election were to be triggered this week, the earliest it could take place would be Thursday 28 November, as the law requires 25 days between an election being called in Parliament and polling day.\n\nMPs had been due to debate the bill over Wednesday and Thursday, but will now return to discussing the contents of the Queen's Speech - which put forward the government's domestic agenda for the new session of Parliament.\n\nConfused about what just happened?
