Syria has started.\n\nThere was mass panic on the streets as warplanes flew overhead and several large explosions rocked the northeast Syrian town of Ras al Ain, on the border across from the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, today.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said airstrikes on a village west of Ras al Ain have killed at least two civilians, leaving several others wounded.\n\nAnd at least one member of the SDF was killed in the Turkish bombardment, Kurdish activists and a Syria war monitor said.\n\nThe SDF, which is backed by the United States, said there was \"huge panic among the people\".\n\nA witness in the Syrian town of Tel Abyad told Reuters that sounds of explosions rang out and smoke was rising from buildings nearby along the border, as hundreds of civilians have fled.\n\nPictures show artillery moving in on the ground, supporting the air strikes.\n\nMeanwhile NTV reports two mortar shells have hit the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said this evening that he US \"does not endorse\" Turkey's assault on Syria, and called the operation \"a bad idea\".\n\nErdo\u011fan said Turkey, along with its Syrian rebel allies, aimed to eliminate a \"terror corridor\" along the southern Turkish border.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nErdo\u011fan said the offensive, dubbed \"Operation Peace Spring\", would aim to eliminate threats from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the Islamic State militants, and enable the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey after the formation of a \"safe zone\" in the area.\n\nThis comes after Donald Trump pulled US troops back from Syria.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the SDF, said the Turkish warplanes were targeting \"civilian areas\" in northern Syria, causing \"a huge panic\" in the region.\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe UK Foreign Secretary said Turkey's incursion into north-east Syria \"risks destabilising\" the region.\n\nDominic Raab said: \"I have serious concerns about the unilateral military action that Turkey has taken.\n\n\"This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering and undermining the progress made against Daesh, which should be our collective focus.\n\n\"Turkey has shown considerable generosity in hosting so many Syrian refugees.\n\n\"But we will not support plans for returns until the conditions are in place for a voluntary and safe return home.\"\n\nWhile Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the military intervention by Turkish forces.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned at the actions of the Turkish military in the Kurdish areas of northern Syria and the security of the Kurdish people,\" he said.\n\n\"There needs to be a withdrawal of all foreign forces from Syria, not further escalation of the conflict.\"\n\n(Image: STR/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, warning of a \"humanitarian catastrophe\", Syrian Kurdish forces issued a general mobilisation call ahead of Turkey's attack.\n\nThe Turkish operation would ignite new fighting in Syria's eight-year-old war, potentially displacing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human rights reported that people had begun fleeing the border town of Tal Abyad.\n\nKurdish politician Nawaf Khalil, who is in northern Syria, said some people were leaving the town for villages farther south.\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters whom Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.\n\nIn a statement released on Twitter, Erdogan said: \u201cTogether with the Syrian National Army, our Turkish Armed Forces launched the #Bar\u0131\u015fp\u0131nar\u0131harekat\u0131 against the PKK / YPG and Deash terrorist organizations in northern Syria (sic).\n\n\u201cOur aim is to destroy the terror corridor which is trying to be established on our southern border and to bring peace and peace to the region.\u201d\n\n(Image: STR/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nA photograph released to Turkish media showed Mr Erdogan at his desk, reportedly giving orders for the start of the operation.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told his Turkish counterpart by phone on Wednesday to avoid any steps in Syria that could damage its peace process, the Kremlin said.\n\nThe Kremlin said that both Putin and Erdo\u011fan agreed in the phone call that Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter: \"Turkish warplanes have started to carry out air strikes on civilian areas.\"\n\nSyrian state media and a Kurdish official separately confirmed bombing hit the town of Ras al-Ain in the northeast along the Turkish border.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: STR/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nA Turkish security source confirmed that Turkish howitzers - a type of tank - have started hitting bases held by the Kurdish militia, the YPG, along with ammunition depots.\n\nThe SDF has asked the US coalition for a 'no fly zone' to stop the Turkish attacks.\n\nMeanwhile the US ambassador to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, has been summoned to the foreign ministry to be briefed on the Turkish operation, CNN reports.\n\nBritain has raised concerns over the situation after Trump announced US troops would withdraw.\n\nUK minister Dr Murrison said military action \u201cmust be avoided as it would destabilise the region\u201d and harm efforts to achieve the \u201cenduring defeat of Daesh\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, former minister Tobias Ellwood warned the situation was a \u201cfundamental change in US foreign policy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThese are not soldiers in uniform but radicalised extremists who are committed to pursuing their jihadist agenda.\u201d\n\nTrump previously warned that he would 'obliterate' the Turkish economy if the country invaded north-east Syria, which is largely held by American-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nHowever, Washington appears to have subsequently softened its rhetoric, with a U.S Defense Department spokesman yesterday saying American troops were being withdrawn as a result of the anticipated Turkish strike.\n\nThe Turkish Defence Ministry said establishment of a safe zone is essential to contribute to stability and peace of the region and for Syrians.\n\nThe U.S. President threatened to destroy its economy if Ankara takes a planned military strike in Syria too far.\n\nBut the U.S. leader himself has opened the door for a Turkish incursion.\n\nSNP foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins accused President Trump of \u201cbetrayal\u201d while Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry said he had \u201cshamed his office\u201d.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly threatened to carry out an incursion against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria who have links to Kurdish guerrillas operating next door in Turkey.\n\n(Image: STR/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe United States began pulling troops back from the northeast Syrian border on Monday, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area.\n\nRetired US Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertlin told CNN Trump's decision was \"shameful\".\n\nHe said: \"Today, anything is possible when these sorts of authoritarian governments have been given a green light by the US.\"\n\nThe Kurds helped the US-backed coalition defeat ISIS and it is feared that their removal could lead to a return of the Jihadist terrorist organisation.\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters whom Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nExpectations of an invasion increased after Mr Trump's announcement on Sunday, although he also threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" Turkey's economy if the Turkish push into Syria went too far.\n\nTurkey has been massing troops for days along its border with Syria and vowed it would go ahead with the military operation and not bow to the US threat.\n\nMr Trump later cast his decision to pull back US troops from parts of north-east Syria as fulfilling a campaign promise to withdraw from the \"endless war\" in the Middle East.\n\nOn Wednesday, he defended his unpopular decision, saying he is focused on the \"BIG PICTURE\" that does not include American involvement in \"stupid endless wars\" in the Middle East.\n\n\"Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\" Mr Trump said in a series of morning tweets. \"The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\"\n\nNato's secretary-general has urged Turkey not to \"further destabilise the region\" through military action in northern Syria.\n\nJens Stoltenberg told a news conference in Rome that Turkey, a Nato ally, \"has legitimate security concerns\", having suffered \"horrendous terrorist attacks\" and hosting thousands of refugees.\n\nHe said Nato has been informed about Turkey's ongoing operation in northern Syria.\n\nHe added: \"It is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering.\"\n\nHe said Turkey should act with \"restraint\" and any action should be \"proportionate\".\n\nMr Stoltenberg will discuss the military action with Turkey's leader on Friday in Istanbul.\n\nAmnesty International issued a statement prior to Turkey launching its attack warning against sparking a \"humanitarian catastrophe\"\n\nThe statement said: \u201cIt is imperative that all parties to this conflict respect international humanitarian law, including by refraining from carrying out attacks on civilians and civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks.\n\n\u201cThe international community must take measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by the Turkish authorities and pro-Turkey armed groups and Kurdish forces if yet another humanitarian catastrophe in northern Syria is to be avoided.", "description": "Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan confirmed the news after Donald Trump pulled US troops back from Syria", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images", "Str Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545342.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Turkey-backed-members-of-Syrian-National-Army-are-moving-to-Turkey-for-Northern-Syria-operation-Aza.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
