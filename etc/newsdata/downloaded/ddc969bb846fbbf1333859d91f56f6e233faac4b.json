Cuadrilla last year won a seven-year battle to restart operations, but the government's tight system of regulation means an 18-hour pause is needed every time a tremor is recorded that exceeds 0.5 on the Richter scale.\n\nCuadrilla has downplayed the significance of the tremors, describing some of those triggered as akin to \"dropping a shopping bag on the floor\" or \"a toddler playing on a wooden floor\".\n\nBut although the government has accepted that domestic shale gas may be a valuable natural resource as Britain transitions to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, it has shown little appetite or urgency to rewrite the rules.\n\n\"The case for using high quality locally sourced natural gas supply over expensive, increasingly distant, potentially insecure and higher CO2 emitting imports remains stronger than ever,\" Mr Egan said.\n\nCuadrilla's fracking permit expires in November, although it has the right to stay on site until April 2023.\n\nThe company will be sweating on the result of a December election, if it is called on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT): the opposition Labour Party has promised to ban fracking altogether.", "description": "Green groups say the project is 'dead', but the fracking company half-owned by ASX-listed AJ Lucas is still fighting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7617%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_211%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b7017d7f692f2b06d7fb55ba9b9ce44cfd9a5cd8", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
