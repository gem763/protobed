Under current rules, opposition parties will have less than two months to shake the incumbent Liberals from government as they travel the country to woo voters.\n\nThe election is predicted to be an acrimonious affair, say pollsters. And as Canadians prepare for the mudslinging, a number of issues are expected to dominate the campaign.\n\nThe environment\n\nA spring of intense flooding in eastern parts of the country and wildfires raging in the west has brought new urgency to Canada\u2019s response to the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in at least the last 10 years, the environment is actually coming out as the top, unprompted national issue of concern, said Nik Nanos, head of the Canadian polling firm Nanos Research. \u201c[It\u2019s] outstripping both jobs and the economy and healthcare, which are the two traditional issues.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a spate of natural disasters, Nanos credits a pitched battle in the country over carbon taxes for keeping the environment as a key electoral issue.\n\nTrudeau is likely to position himself as the leader best equipped to meet the country\u2019s climate obligations, despite the government being far off track for its Paris accord commitments.\n\nWhile the rival Conservative party has been widely panned for its lack of substantial environmental policies, Trudeau has also received vigorous pushback from climate activists.\n\nIn late June, the government declared a climate emergency in the country \u2013 and then approved a multibillion-dollar oil pipeline expansion the following day.\n\n\u201cFor the Trudeau government to approve this pipeline after declaring a climate emergency makes about as much sense as pouring gasoline on a burning fire,\u201d said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Hudema.\n\nPopulism\n\nAmid rising tides of far-right populism in the US and Europe, the election will mark the first country-wide appearance of the People\u2019s Party of Canada \u2013 a rightwing splinter party led by the former Conservative minister Maxime Bernier. Ever since its formation, the party has railed against immigration and Canada\u2019s multiculturalism policies.\n\nLike many countries, Canada has witnessed a growing intolerance for immigrants and racial minorities among conservative-identified voters, although analysts are unsure how much support a far-right populist party can expect. Bernier\u2019s low polling numbers have so far disqualified him from the two leader\u2019s debates held in October.\n\nThe country\u2019s electoral system typically rewards parties that cater to the centre, said Tamara Small, a political science professor at University of Guelph, where the plurality of votes are up for grabs.\n\nBut analysts also see intolerance and xenophobia becoming increasingly concentrated in parties on the right. This recent shift speaks to a hardening of political views across all parties, said Frank Graves, president of the political polling company Ekos Research.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing radical polarization on issues like climate change and \u2026 immigration in general,\u201d said Graves. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about stuff we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nThe Green party\n\nThe real beneficiaries of any populist wave could be the Green party, said Graves and Nanos.\n\n\u201cThe Greens, in my polling, are ahead of the [leftwing New Democratic party], which has never happened,\u201d said Graves \u2013 signalling what could prove to be a fundamental reshaping of Canadian politics.\n\nIf an election was held in the coming days, he said, \u201cthe Greens are very close to the point where they could be the power-broker that kept to a minority government in play.\u201d\n\nRecent electoral success in local and provincial elections has buoyed support for the party and polling also suggests that Elizabeth May, the Green leader \u2013 and most seasoned politician currently in federal politics \u2013 remains the most popular leader in the country.\n\nMuch of the party\u2019s appeal lies in its strong environmental stance, but also its position at the fringes of mainstream politics. Polling shows the Greens drawing support not just from disaffected Liberal voters, who feel the prime minister has not acted decisively on the environment, but also from the NDP \u2013 and even the Conservatives, said Graves.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the Green[s] \u2026 are Canada\u2019s kind of \u2018friendly response\u2019 to populism,\u201d said Nanos. \u201cPeople that are dissatisfied or disenchanted with the system and are disappointed with the mainstream parties are now looking at the Greens as a protest vote against the system.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, 14 frustrated members of the NDP in the province of New Brunswick announced they would be leaving the party for the provincial and federal Greens.\n\nThe wild card\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Trudeau was polling a distant third before the autumn election. Seemingly out of nowhere, he surged ahead and secured a robust parliamentary majority.\n\nWhile surprises could \u2013 and probably will \u2013 pop up domestically, Nanos predicts a major disruption could come south of the border, from the US president.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump will probably say something that could materially shape the outcome of the election. It could be on purpose. It could be by accident,\u201d said Nanos.\n\nTrump has repeatedly broken with traditional taboos against commenting on foreign elections, weighing in on the UK Conservative leadership race and publicly supporting Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s re-election campaign as Israeli prime minister.\n\nAny barbs lobbed at Trudeau by the president could rally Canadians around the prime minister, said Nanos, and any endorsement of a Conservative candidate would probably be a \u201cstake in the heart of the Conservative party\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cCanadians are especially tuned into Donald Trump, whether they love or hate him because, realistically, Canada is hostage to geography.\u201d\n\nThe election is likely to be held on 21 October.", "description": "The prime minister is likely to call a vote for next month in which the environment, populism and Trump are all expected to feature", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco", "Moustafa Bayoumi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba778159d82834aa36202cc313e705a624e36c2/0_167_3331_2000/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a3ad38b840766925d5ed06215b71d0f"}
