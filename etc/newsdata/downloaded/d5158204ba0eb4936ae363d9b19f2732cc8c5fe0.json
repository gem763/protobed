I feel her presence all the time. Not many people get a second chance like this.\u201d\n\nMichael is a former timeshare salesman and was famously called \u201cMr Spain\u201d by Lynda when she appeared on ITV\u2019s Loose Women.\n\nHis wedding news comes in the week of the fifth anniversary of Lynda\u2019s death from bowel cancer on October 19, 2014. She was 66.\n\nNew love Pam, 57, reveals she visits Lynda\u2019s grave with Michael \u2013 and sometimes goes alone.\n\nPam, who lost partner Victor in 2011, says: \u201cI like to tend the grave and I also like to have a chat with her. \u2018Hi, Lynda,\u2019 I\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you OK? I\u2019ve cleaned the headstone and Michael\u2019s doing well. I\u2019m looking after him.\u2019\n\n(Image: Roland Leon / Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cBut she knows that anyway. I think she\u2019d be pleased he\u2019s found love again. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d want him to be unhappy. I believe she\u2019s smiling down on us in the same way Victor is smiling down on me.\u201d\n\nThe wedding will be at St Bartholomew\u2019s Church in Crewkerne, Somerset, where Michael\u2019s parents are also buried.\n\nHe and Lynda were married for six years and Michael kept a bedside vigil at a London hospital during her final days.\n\nBut a family rift blew up after she died as Michael bought an eight-bedroom Grade II listed mansion amid accusations he was blowing the star\u2019s money.\n\nHer sons Michael, 36, and Robbie, 31, are embroiled in a bitter inheritance row with Michael and will not be at next year\u2019s nuptials.\n\nPam became aware of ill-feeling towards Michael just months after they started seeing each other.\n\nShe explains: \u201cI didn\u2019t know who Michael or \u2018Mr Spain\u2019 was at first. I knew about Lynda of course. As I was growing up, I\u2019d watch her in All Creatures Great And Small or in the Oxo ads.\n\nBut quite quickly people started saying bad things about him to me. But they\u2019d never met him.\n\n\u201cThree months after I met him, I read Michael\u2019s book, My Lynda, in a single evening. It was deeply moving.\n\nIt reduced me to tears but it told me all I needed to know. It also crossed my mind, if he\u2019d been as bad as some people claimed, Lynda would never have been with him in the first place. It upset me.\n\n\u201cI cried. But I knew the truth. I like to think now that, because my loss had occurred three years earlier, I was able to help Michael in the grieving process. But, in a way, we were helping each other.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nPam, from Staffordshire, explains how she fell for Michael at a Christmas party in December 2016. She goes on: \u201cHe had lovely grey hair and a matching smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d no idea who he was. When we were introduced, I never made any connection between him and Lynda. We got chatting and I liked him straight away.\n\n\u201cWe had our first kiss at that Christmas party, under the mistletoe. Corny, I know. But it was no more than that, although it was obvious there was a strong physical attraction.\n\nWe started meeting at weekends and then, in December 2017, Michael asked if I\u2019d consider moving in with him. I said yes immediately because it felt the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting but also scary. Suddenly, I was one half of a couple again. I\u2019d wake up in the morning and there was another body lying next to me. It was wonderful. I was no longer waking up alone in an empty, cold house.\u201d\n\nMichael popped the question in December last year while they were at church and chose Valentine\u2019s Day to put a ring on her finger.\n\nMichael says: \u201cI lost Lynda in October 2014 and, although I knew she was dying, I thought I\u2019d never find love again. When Lynda was diagnosed in 2012, we never made love again for the rest of her days.\n\n\u201cIt would have been disrespectful. Pam and I didn\u2019t have sex for a long time. But when it finally happened, it was more special because of the wait.\n\n\u201cWe were ready at that point to make that commitment. It felt right.\u201d\n\nMichael\u2019s devotion to Lynda is still evident in the mansion he now shares with Pam. And his new partner, a former accounts manager with a medical company, is unfazed by tributes to Lynda.\n\nPictures fill the walls, a life-size canvas of Lynda is at the foot of the stairs and a cushion bearing the words \u201cLynda Bellingham OBE 2014\u201d is on the sofa.\n\nMichael, who runs an elite taxi business with a \u00a31million turnover, gave the star\u2019s clothes to charity and her impressive shoe collection to his daughter Stacey, who will be maid of honour when he weds Pam. But Michael has no contact with Lynda\u2019s sons and was not invited to Robbie\u2019s 2017 wedding.\n\nRobbie and Michael have accused Michael of \u201csplurging\u201d the inheritance and claimed they had only seen \u00a3750 of Lynda\u2019s reported \u00a310million fortune.\n\nThey claimed Michael told them she had written a will leaving everything to him and that he had only given them a tiny cash handout.\n\n(Image: Roland Leon / Sunday Mirror)\n\nThey also accused him of disrespecting their mother in an interview in which he claimed to have sex with her ghost spirit.\n\nMichael says TV star Lynda was \u201cnot as rich as people thought\u201d and even left a \u00a350,000 debt.\n\nHe adds: \u201cI gave the boys a luxury flat in North London. I regarded them as my boys. So, it\u2019s a matter of real sadness to me that we\u2019re no longer speaking.\n\nI wish them nothing but the best. I hate to think what Lynda would say if she knew it had come to this.\u201d\n\nMichael also slated some of Lynda\u2019s showbiz pals for turning their backs on him.\n\nPam also reveals that anonymous poison pen letters were sent to Michael \u2013 wishing him dead and accusing him of \u201crobbing\u2019\u201d Lynda\u2019s sons of their inheritance. She says the notes were handed to police.\n\nMoving forward, Michael and Pam want to put the bitterness behind them and focus on their July 5 wedding.\n\nPam adds: \u201cMichael and I are so lucky to have found each other. We\u2019re very happy.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Widower of Loose Women and Oxo ad star says upcoming nuptials have her blessing despite strained relationship with her sons over her will", "authors": ["Richard Barber", "Image", "Sunday Mirror", "Roland Leon", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565247.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MSM_300919_PATTEMORE_28JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
