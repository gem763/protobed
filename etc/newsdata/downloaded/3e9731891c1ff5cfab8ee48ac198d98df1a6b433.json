On Wednesday the president tweeted an instantly iconic photo of Nancy Pelosi reprimanding him during a meeting on Syria. \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d he wrote.\n\nThere is generally little point trying to figure out what goes on in Trump\u2019s head because very little goes on in his head. The man is pure id. However, one imagines that Trump thought the photo made him look calm and collected, and made Pelosi seem like a hysterical woman, who is too emotional to lead. In reality (a realm where Trump rarely ventures), of course, Pelosi looked like the most powerful person in the room. She\u2019s standing tall amid a group of smirking white men and she\u2019s literally standing up to Trump. The president, meanwhile, looks like a toddler who has been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.\n\nThe Pelosi/Trump photo immediately went viral. And for good reason \u2013 the picture doesn\u2019t just show a particular moment between two politicians, it\u2019s a perfect snapshot of the patriarchy. I doubt there is a working woman in the world who hasn\u2019t, at some point, found herself the lone female in a boardroom full of condescending men. And I doubt there\u2019s a woman in the world who hasn\u2019t had her strength rebranded as \u201caggression\u201d, \u201cbossiness\u201d, or \u201chysteria\u201d. Calling women \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cunhinged\u201d in order to put them in their place is something men have been doing for centuries.\n\nPelosi, it should be said, didn\u2019t seem particular nervous about the episode with Trump. Rather she spun it to her advantage and turned the picture of her reprimanding Trump into her Twitter cover photo. I\u2019m not always Pelosi\u2019s biggest fan, but there\u2019s no denying she has the art of dealing with an unhinged narcissist down pat.\n\nWomen\u2019s World Cup breaks viewing records\n\nAn unprecedent 1.2 billion viewers watched the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup, according to Fifa. \u201cThe fact we broke one billion shows the pulling power of the women\u2019s game,\u201d the Fifa president said. Too right it does. Now maybe we could start ensuring the women\u2019s game also has paying power and start reimbursing female players properly.\n\nBadass of the week: Lebanese kickboxing protester\n\nLebanon has seen massive protests this week over government corruption. Please do enjoy this video of one fearless Lebanese woman kicking a minister\u2019s armed bodyguard in the groin. I wouldn\u2019t normally condone violence, but I\u2019m sure we can all agree that there are occasions in which kicking a corrupt patriarchy in the nuts is very much warranted.\n\nA giant leap for womankind\n\nNasa astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir made history on Friday with the first all-female space walk. The herstoric event was originally scheduled to take place earlier this year but, embarrassingly, had to be postponed because of a somewhat sexist wardrobe malfunction.\n\nWrangling with The Wing women\n\nThe Wing is a women-only co-working space that has generated a ton of buzz and divided a lot of opinions. Is it an example of female empowerment or elitism and privilege? The Guardian takes an in-depth look.\n\nMoroccan journalist in \u2018illegal abortion\u2019 case pardoned\n\nLast month Hajar Raissouni was sentenced to a year in prison for \u201chaving an illegal abortion and sexual relations outside marriage\u201d. Raissouni has said she was targeted for her work as a journalist and the case has come to symbolize the suppression of the free press and women\u2019s rights in Morocco. On Wednesday, following international pressure, Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI pardoned Raissouni. The pardon has been criticized as being superficial rather than a sign of any systemic change.\n\nAustralia\u2019s \u2018great feminist Fyre Festival\u2019\n\nJournalist Tracey Spicer is the face of Australia\u2019s #MeToo movement. She launched an organisation called NOW Australia, similar to Americas \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d, that would let victims of sexual abuse access legal services and has received tons of accolades for her work. Indeed, she is due to collect the Sydney Peace Prize soon. As BuzzFeed News reports, however, NOW has drastically failed to live up to its hype and is now being described as the \u201cgreat feminist Fyre Festival\u201d.\n\nBlack and Hispanic women assigned the worst schedules\n\nThe University of California\u2019s Shift Project has found that hourly workers are more likely to be assigned irregular schedules if they are minorities or women. Researchers found that white men were given the best hours, while Black and Hispanic workers were stuck with the worst. Non-white workers were also more likely to get their shifts cancelled. This scheduling uncertainty has serious consequences for everything from childcare arrangements to stress levels.\n\nPrincess Ivanka tours Louis Vuitton factories\n\nThe first daughter continued her brave fight for women\u2019s rights by ignoring everything that\u2019s happening in Syria and touring Louis Vuitton factories instead. Because nothing empowers women like a $5,000 handbag!", "description": "I doubt there\u2019s any woman who hasn\u2019t had her strength rebranded as \u2018aggression\u2019 \u2013 calling us \u2018crazy\u2019 is a tired old trick", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45f55d4639ca2ed9ab0beb6768afced8cc303ad0/0_0_2322_1393/master/2322.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=583cbc11259910d32613d91cfc22ce4c", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
