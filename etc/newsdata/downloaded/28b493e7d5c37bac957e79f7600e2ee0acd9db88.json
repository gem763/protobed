He really made a lot of putts, a lot of unbelievable up and downs to kind of keep me from getting all the momentum. I really, really played solidly today.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad turned 60 last week, so maybe it\u2019s a little 60th birthday gift to him.\u201d\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Lee whose second child, originally due closer to Christmas, was born prematurely last Sunday and is in an incubator.\n\n\u201cBefore I tee off my very first tee shot on Thursday, if someone\u2019s going to give me solo second, I would take it in a heartbeat. It is a good week, but also very disappointing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to win the CJ CUP. It means a lot to me to win it in front of the Korean fans and all my Korean family, but it is what it is. I gave my best out there today and solo second was the best I could do.\u201d\n\nHideki Matsuyama (65), Gary Woodland (66) and Cameron Smith (69) shared third place at 15-under.\n\nA further three shots behind was Jordan Spieth, who returned 71, while fellow American Phil Mickelson finished with 68 to be joined by Australian Jason Day (71) at seven-under.\n\nPGA Tour\u2019s three-event Asian swing now moves to Japan where Tiger Woods will compete in the Zozo Championship before Shanghai hosts the World Golf Championships from Oct. 31.", "description": "Inaugural champion Justin Thomas staved off a challenge by Danny Lee to claim his second CJ Cup title in three years with a two-shot victory over the Korean-born New Zealander at Nine Bridges on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442944598&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J088", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
