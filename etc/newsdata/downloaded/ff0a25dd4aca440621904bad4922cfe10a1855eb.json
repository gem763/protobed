(AP) - Environmental regulators say pesticide levels in some Oregon waterways have dropped to fractions of former concentrations due to voluntary changes by farmers.\n\nThe Capital Press reported Wednesday that the state Department of Environmental Quality found that growers who altered spray regimens helped achieve the water quality improvements.\n\nOfficials say about 50% of waterway sites tested under an interagency \u201cpesticide stewardship partnership\u201d program showed progress in pesticide detections and concentrations.\n\nAreas with reductions included the Walla Walla watershed and Waco basin.\n\nThe tests compared results between 2015 and 2017 to the previous two years.\n\nOfficials say about 27% of tested sites showed declines in water quality from pesticides, while 23% showed no change.\n\nOfficials say the monitoring targets streams where pesticides have been detected, while waterways without occurrences were dropped.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Capital Press, http://www.capitalpress.com/washington\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Environmental regulators say pesticide levels in some Oregon waterways have dropped to fractions of former concentrations due to voluntary changes by farmers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
