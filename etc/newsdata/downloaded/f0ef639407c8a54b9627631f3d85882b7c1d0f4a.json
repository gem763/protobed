However, knife possession has increased in recent years, with more than 2,300 crimes reported last year.\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nThe girl 'threatened with a machete'\n\nIt's not just young men who are affected. In Blackpool, students Keeley, 17, and Lauren, 18, have both been threatened on the estate where they live, with knives brandished in relatively trivial teenage disagreements.\n\n\"I got threatened with a machete in a park by a group of lads when I was playing football,\" Keeley said.\n\n\"They wanted to play in our half, but we said no.\"\n\nImage caption Students Lauren (l) and Keeley have both been threatened with stabbing near their homes\n\nLauren says she doesn't feel safe in the town: \"Me and my mate were walking home and a guy came out and threatened to stab one of my mates.\"\n\nIn 2018, the resort had 14.3 serious knife crime offences per 10,000 people, putting it in the top 25 most dangerous places for knife crime in England and Wales, of the 275 areas which gave data.\n\nDrugs gangs, school exclusion rates, poverty, unemployment and cuts to services have all been blamed for a rise in youth violence in towns like Blackpool and Preston.\n\nLast month, official figures showed eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England were in Blackpool.\n\n\"There is a significant issue with county lines [drugs courier] gangs in Blackpool, and from that we are seeing that means a lot of young people are carrying knives,\" Ashley Hackett, chief executive of Blackpool Football Club Community Trust , told the BBC.\n\n\"We have an awful lot of children and teenagers who are living in deprivation and whatever way they can find to earn money and support households, legally and illegally, they are doing it. That includes drugs and knives,\" he added.\n\nIn 2018, almost half of all suspects in serious knife crime offences in England and Wales, were aged 24 and under.\n\n'Emotionally exploited'\n\nThe experiences of young women like Keeley and Lauren are becoming more commonplace.\n\nLast year, 15% of knife crime suspects were female and, including those attacked in domestic abuse incidents, a quarter of victims of knife crime were women.\n\nDr Mike Rowe of Liverpool University, who has been observing police officers at work for the past six years, told the BBC: \"Girls and young women are being exploited to carry weapons because they are much less likely to be stopped and searched by police.\n\n\"The attention on male suspects may lead to the deliberate recruitment of young women.\"\n\nAnti-knife crime campaigner Lydia Lawrence, who has herself survived two stabbings by two different women, agrees that gang violence is on the rise, and girls with low self-esteem are being emotionally exploited.\n\nMs Lawrence, who's from west London, was first a victim of knife crime aged just 12, when she was cut on her face.\n\nShe nearly died when she was 21, after being stabbed through her kidney and liver.\n\nMs Lawrence, who was born in prison, excluded from school at 12 and homeless by 16, warned that girls from troubled backgrounds and broken homes are the most at risk.\n\nDr Rowe believes police responses to knife crime have been \"seriously hampered by the cuts in the past eight years and more\", contributing to a fall in the number of cases solved.\n\nHe said that every time there is a stabbing, officers are pulled from neighbourhood teams to guard the scene as forensics are gathered.\n\n\"It's these neighbourhood teams that would normally be expected to gather the intelligence which investigations of knife crime and gang activity rely on.\n\n\"So there is a vicious cycle in which rising demands hinder the capacity to investigate those very crimes.\"\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire, the national lead in tackling serious violent crime at the National Police Chiefs' Council, blamed police funding cuts for the fall in charge rates.\n\n\"The large reduction in police funding since 2010 has meant fewer detectives with less time and a bigger workload taking on long investigations, meaning it can be more difficult to get a charge.\n\n\"In some cases police have fearful witnesses, and victims who do not feel able to engage with officers or the court process.\n\n\"This means there is little possibility of a prosecution.\n\n\"Some forces who have been given additional funding to tackle violence are using that to improve forensic capabilities, so even when the victim is unwilling to proceed, police can still progress a case.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson responded: \"We are taking action to tackle the violent crime which has such a devastating impact on our communities.\n\n\"This includes supporting the police by recruiting 20,000 new police officers over the next three years, making it easier for them to use stop and search powers, and investing \u00a310m in additional funding to allow forces to increase the number of officers carrying Tasers.\"", "description": "\"We are suffering just as much as anywhere else,\" says anti-knife crime campaigner in Preston.", "authors": ["Ben Butcher", "Sarah Corker", "Wesley Stephenson", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q6w1z.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
