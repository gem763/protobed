Sorkin stressed the importance of the subject, adding that it results in \u201cbetter voters.\u201d The Moneyball screenwriter \u2014 who chalked up Trump\u2019s historical victory as a win for the KKK, white nationalists, sexists, racists, buffoons, and angry white men \u2014 took a veiled shot at Trump\u2019s supporters, suggesting that a lack of informed voters in society results in \u201cthe tribalism that we have\u201d with Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe need to make better voters. Otherwise, it\u2019s bound to descend into the tribalism that we have,\u201d he said, according to Variety.\n\nAnother audience member told Sorkin that \u201cwe need better candidates and need to eliminate the two-party system.\u201d While Sorkin agreed with the general sentiment, he stuck to his initial assertion, arguing that \u201cbetter voters get us better candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, in a democracy, how can it not ultimately be the responsibility of the voters?\u201d Sorkin asked. \u201cWe\u2019re right to point to all the people we\u2019re pointing at right now in Washington saying, \u2018This is so un-American, what\u2019s going on,\u2019 but when are voters going to bear some responsibility?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery four years, there\u2019s this incredible opportunity, because most people don\u2019t have time to do much more than to get through their day and get food on the table and take care of their kids, but every four years, we have the opportunity to hear a great debate and make great progress,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cWe never hear the great debate. It\u2019s \u2018Hillary\u2019s emails!\u2019 It\u2019s wasted every time, and that is so frustrating,\u201d Sorkin added.\n\nSorkin has remained a vocal critic of the president, once describing Trump as a \u201creally dumb guy with an observable psychiatric disorder.\u201d\n\nCategorizing the president as \u201cdumb\u201d is one of Sorkin\u2019s go-to critiques. The Molly\u2019s Game director repeated his longheld assessment during an interview with Vanity Fair last month, calling the president \u201cstaggeringly, breathtakingly dumb.\u201d", "description": "Aaron Sorkin took a veiled shot at President Trump's supporters, suggesting that a lack of informed voters in society results in \"the tribalism that we have\" now.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/betteraaronsorkin1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
