REUTERS/Omar Sobhani/File Photo\n\nThe committee said that Zalmay Khalilzad, the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, would hold a classified briefing for the entire panel on Thursday morning.\n\nUnder an agreement reached between the panel and the State Department on Wednesday, the closed-door session will be followed by a public hearing on the administration\u2019s Afghanistan policy with Alice Wells, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs.\n\n\u201cWhile I would have preferred to hear from Ambassador Khalilzad in an open setting, I\u2019m glad our members will have this long overdue opportunity to press for answers on the peace plan,\u201d said Eliot Engel, the committee\u2019s chairman, in a statement. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken a subpoena to get the State Department to work with this committee and allow us to perform our oversight duties.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Committee issued a subpoena on Sept. 12, ordering Khalilzad to testify on Sept. 19.\n\nThat announcement came the day after Trump proclaimed negotiations with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban leaders dead after scrapping planned talks with the group at Camp David.\n\nThe committee said it had been frustrated for some time over the administration\u2019s failure to allow briefings by Khalilzad. Khalilzad has briefed lawmakers in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, but had declined three requests to appear before the committee in the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe abrupt announcement that peace talks had ended - and news that Trump had planned to bring Taliban leaders to the presidential retreat - angered many in Congress.\n\nIt was followed by the exit of Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, who had opposed the plan. Trump announced on Wednesday that hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien would replace Bolton.\n\nBringing troops home from Afghanistan has been one of Trump\u2019s main foreign policy objectives.\n\nThe subpoena for Khalilzad was the first issued by the committee since Democrats took control of the House in January and Engel became chairman.\n\nKaren Freeman, assistant to the administrator in the Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs at the U.S. Agency for International Development, will also testify at Thursday\u2019s public hearing.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's top negotiator for Afghanistan will hold a briefing for the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, the panel said on Wednesday, after the committee subpoenaed him in frustration at his refusal to meet with its members.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431401568&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H23H", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
