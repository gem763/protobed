But twice a month they hand out audio guides and lead walking tours organised by the Laboratorio 53 association in English and Italian.\n\nFirst stop is Piazza di Spagna in the historic centre, with its grand staircase, expensive boutiques and snap-happy tourists.\n\nAbdul Gafaru says it reminds him of the Vienna City district of Accra in his native Ghana, where \u201cthe rich go to have fun\u201d.\n\nThe difference is that here \u201cthe rich and poor behave and dress the same\u201d, and while tourists \u201ccan leave their country, go on holiday, then go back home\u201d, Gafaru cannot.\n\nMamadou Cellou Diallo, a Guinean who supervises the walk, told AFP the aim was to \u201ccombine our stories with the sites, and show things people don\u2019t usually notice\u201d.\n\nHe shows how a climbing plant on one wall hides a 17th-century plaque which threatens fly tippers with heavy fines.\n\nCenturies on, garbage litters the streets of Roman suburbs where many migrants live, and it reminds many of rubbish-strewn streets of large African cities.\n\nThe tourists stop at the edge of the busy Via del Tritone, where Lamine Sanogo tells the tale of his journey to Italy from Mali, which saw him cross five borders and the Mediterranean sea \u2014 where 25 of those on the boat with him died.\n\n\u201cThey tell their stories with great simplicity and dignity, simply to say that they exist\u201d, says Eve, a French woman who has lived in Rome for 28 years and did not want to give her surname.\n\nKaba Coulibaly from Conakry in Guinea says he hopes the project will help combat \u201cprejudices against black people\u201d.\n\n\u201cItalians think we are thieves, and bandits. We decided we should show off our cultures and make people think\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Water scares me\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe refugees and asylum seekers come from across Africa and their stories only scratch the surface of the violence and trauma they have suffered along their perilous journeys to Europe.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to convey our emotions to the tourist through an event we have experienced,\u201d Diallo says.\n\nStanding in front of the Trevi Fountain, the listeners are transported to Casamance in Senegal, where Sidia Camara lost a childhood friend, aged just 10, when he drowned in a river where the village children played.\n\n\u201cWater scares me,\u201d he says now. Despite that, he likes the Trevi Fountain because it reminds him of the \u201cbolon\u201d \u2014 which means moving water in his native Mandinka tongue \u2014 though \u201cthey are different in their sounds\u201d.\n\nFor the past three years, migrants assisted by the association have been taking part in a radio laboratory where they write and then record their stories, to which ambient sounds are then added.\n\nThreads of those stories are then linked to tours of the picturesque Trastevere, San Lorenzo and Monti neighbourhoods.\n\nMarco Signorelli of Laboratorio 53 says the tours bring in money for the migrants, but are mainly aimed at \u201caffirming the idea that migrants are citizens like any others, and their perspective can enrich our vision of the public space\u201d.\n\nRome local Alfredo Gagliardi says it made him look at the historic centre differently.\n\n\u201cWhen I come to the centre it\u2019s for entertainment. For them, it\u2019s to go to the police station for their residence permits\u201d.\n\nCoulibaly says he is often racially abused in Italy, but being a guide helps serve as a counterbalance.\n\n\u201cThis experience allows me to build relationships, meet people who are interested in my story and me personally,\u201d he says.", "description": "Rome (AFP) \u2013 The Eternal City\u2019s famed monuments are given an African twist by refugees Abdul, Kaba and Sidia, who use anecdotes from their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/10a4b9_rome-trevi-fountain-is-one-stops-on-tour-rome-invisible-migrants-offer-eternal-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
