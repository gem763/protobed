That is comforting, but only up to a point. There is still likely to be turmoil on stock and bond markets and the already enfeebled currency will be hit hard.\n\nNo Deal threat: In its worst-case scenario, the Bank of England envisages a fall in GDP of 5.5 per cent, a rise in unemployment to 7 per cent and inflation hitting 5.25 per cent\n\nKristalina Georgieva, the new head of the IMF, says any kind of Brexit will be 'painful', particularly as it coincides with a 'synchronised slowdown' around the world, with a slump in global manufacturing and trade tensions running high.\n\nFor its part, the Institute for Fiscal Studies' (IFS) annual Green Budget a couple of days ago was a sobering read.\n\nBoris Johnson and Chancellor Sajid Javid have already set out their stall for an election with promises of lavish spending on the NHS, law and order and education.\n\nCarrots have been dangled in the shape of tax cuts, such as a proposal to take 2.5m people out of the higher rate tax bracket.\n\nProblem is, a No Deal Brexit that would strain the public purse strings is neither wise nor sustainable. The IFS reckons it would push up Government debt to its highest level for 50 years.\n\nBorrowing could balloon up to \u00a3100billion, or 4 per cent of national income, busting right through the Government's own fiscal mandate.\n\nA No Deal Brexit would mean two years of zero growth, followed by low growth.\n\nAny forecaster can be wrong. The IFS, however, isn't a politicised fear-monger, but a highly respected body with a reputation for independence and integrity.\n\nBrexit is not just about the economy. It is about sovereignty and self-determination, which many Leave voters will consider more important.\n\nIn the long term, the UK can certainly prosper outside the EU. But let's not pretend there is no price to be paid for No Deal.\n\nLeap of faith\n\nThe move by John and Irene Hays, the north-eastern couple who own Hays Travel, to buy 555 of Thomas Cook's stores, saving 2,500 jobs is a bold one.\n\nIt is a leap of faith to take on so many bricks-and-mortar shops at a time when more people are booking their holidays online.\n\nJohn Hays reckons he and Irene can succeed because they are independent, offering holidays from across the market.\n\nThey sound like good sorts \u2013 when their sales hit \u00a31billion, the couple \u2013 who own the firm between them \u2013 shared out \u00a31million among their staff. However, they are obviously hard-nosed business people too.\n\nThe sum they paid for the shops has not been disclosed but they are bound to have got a knockdown price.\n\nFrom their point of view, it was an opportunity to swoop in and take their own business to a different level at a stroke.\n\nThe Thomas Cook chain that they have bought is bigger than their existing operations: currently they have just 190 shops and 1,900 staff.\n\nThe risk is that the takeover and the work involved in the integration proves to be overwhelming. Even so, it is a welcome show of confidence in the beleaguered British High Street.\n\nWrong number\n\nBT'S revamp of its 615 stores so that its brand will return to shop fronts for the first time in 17 years is also a boost for the High Street.\n\nUnder its new boss Philip Jansen, the company recognises it has to improve customer service, which has too often been awful.\n\nBehind all of this is the need to move to ultrafast broadband \u2013 a key element of Boris's election sales pitch \u2013 to improve people's lives, help small firms sell to a wider range of customers and to improve the country's woeful productivity performance.\n\nThe company has some sensible plans, including a team of 900 home tech experts, and bringing all of its customer call centres back to the UK and Ireland by January, a year earlier than planned.\n\nIt's just a shame that, as my colleagues on Money Mail have discovered, BT has been operating a bonkers policy on call centres, in effect offering two-tier service levels.\n\nOnly customers paying extra for a premium broadband package, starting at more than \u00a360 a month, are guaranteed to be put through to a call centre in the UK or Ireland when they have a problem.\n\nFor a company with 'British' in its name, that's quite an own goal.", "description": "Warnings about the economic damage that will be created by a No Deal Brexit are coming thick and fast.
