The Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager faced explosive backlash from China after he tweeted Friday in support of the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThe since-deleted tweet contained an image reading: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMorey, his team and the NBA swiftly apologized to China, which is emerging as the most lucrative fan base for the U.S. basketball league. The league\u2019s commissioner, Adam Silver, later said that, while the hurt feelings were regrettable, the NBA had no intention of reining in free expression among players, coaches or owners and front-office executives.\n\nSee: NBA commissioner Silver says the league is not apologizing for Morey\n\nAnd: What you need to know about the feud between the NBA and China\n\nDespite the mea culpas, serious damage may have been done to the team\u2019s financial relationships with Chinese companies and fans.\n\nStreaming partner and tech giant Tencent TCEHY, -0.25% 700, -1.73% said it would not show future Rockets games, as did Chinese state television broadcaster CCTV. Leading Chinese athletic-apparel maker Li-Ning also publicly expressed anger at the tweet.\n\nEven the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 run by the Houston Rockets legend Yao Ming \u2014 said it was suspending its relationship with Yao\u2019s former team.\n\nBut a backlash to the backlash was brewing.\n\nThe NBA said, \u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nThis contrition was too much for several prominent Americans, who saw it as embarrassing to show such deference to a one-party state with a poor human-rights record, and which is currently detaining hundreds of thousands of males from the country\u2019s Uighur minority, who Beijing says are at risk of Islamic radicalization.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 Texas Democrats who are both seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination \u2014 condemned the apology. O\u2019Rourke tweeted: \u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nCastro said the U.S. \u201cmust lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nFellow Texan Ted Cruz, the Republican senator, stepped in, too, tweeting: \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.\u201d\n\nBen Rhodes, a deputy national-security adviser under President Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cThe people of Hong Kong are risking their lives to stand up for human rights, and the NBA throws Morey under the bus for a few bucks. Look to the streets of Hong Kong for courage, not to NBA owners. Disgraceful.\u201d\n\nJoe Tsai saw things differently. The owner of the Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese tech behemoth Alibaba BABA, +2.01% penned an open letter on Facebook FB, +1.18% in which he called the Hong Kong protests \u201ca separatist movement,\u201d and said Morey\u2019s comments crossed a red line.\n\nESPN senior writer Ramona Shelburne reported that Tsai \u201chas been a major asset for the NBA in managing this crisis in China.\u201d\n\nGregg Popovich, head coach of the NBA\u2019s San Antonio Spurs, lauded Silver for ultimately reaffirming the league\u2019s commitment to free expression.\n\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t easy for him to say,\u201d said Popovich, who along with Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors is considered one of the league\u2019s most outspoken coaches on politics and social issues. \u201cHe said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. So I\u2019m thrilled with what he said.\u201d\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "description": "Withering criticism over perceived cowing to China following tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters.", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS738_morey1_ZG_20191006181322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
