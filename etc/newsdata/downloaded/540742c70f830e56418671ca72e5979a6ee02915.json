(Alexander Drago/Reuters)\n\nJordan E. Taylor is a historian of print and politics in revolutionary America. He teaches history at Smith College.\n\nOn Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s (R-Calif.) demand that she suspend the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump for pressuring foreign countries to investigate a potential 2020 election opponent. In her letter, she pointed out that \u201cour Founders were specifically intent on ensuring that foreign entities did not undermine the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nPelosi is right. The first generation of American political leaders understood the danger of foreign involvement in their elections because they lived through it. Throughout the 1790s, France\u2019s ambassadors repeatedly sought to influence the results of American elections, hoping to sway policy in their favor.\n\nEven after this meddling ended, fear of foreign influence persisted, ultimately making subsequent untainted elections seem illegitimate. Public faith in the democratic process had eroded. The entire experience convinced the founding generation that democracies live or die based on the integrity of their elections \u2014 a lesson we must remember today.\n\nIn 1793, a quirky and energetic man named Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat arrived in the United States to assume his position as the new ambassador of France. Many Americans responded enthusiastically to Gen\u00eat at political gatherings and social engagements as he integrated himself with the Francophile Democratic-Republican party that opposed the Federalist Washington administration.\n\nUnsurprisingly, relations between Gen\u00eat and the Washington administration quickly soured. George Washington\u2019s repeated refusal to align American interests with France angered Gen\u00eat. According to some accounts, he warned that if the president continued to rebuff him, he would \u201cappeal to the people\u201d themselves. This threat earned him immediate infamy, because it suggested that Gen\u00eat might seek to influence the American elections in 1794 to build support for policies friendly to France. To prevent him from taking such actions, the Washington administration demanded that France recall Gen\u00eat.\n\nThe new French ambassador, a sulking, stubborn man named Jean Antoine Joseph Fauchet, practiced greater discretion in advancing French interests. But though he was not as flamboyant as Gen\u00eat, Fauchet nonetheless paid small subsidies to Democratic-Republicans as they fought against the adoption of the looming Anglo-American \u201cJay Treaty\u201d that would harm France\u2019s interests.\n\nHis successor, Pierre-Auguste Adet, followed the Gen\u00eat model. Fearing the adoption of the Jay Treaty, Adet brazenly followed through on Gen\u00eat\u2019s threat to \u201cappeal to the people.\u201d He leaked a secret copy of the treaty to a friendly newspaper, stirring up violent but ultimately ineffective protests. Encouraged by instructions from France, he then decided to engineer the resignation or defeat of President George Washington, whom he had determined to be an enemy of France. During 1796, Adet traveled through New England, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York to organize opposition to Washington and his Federalist allies.\n\nThat September, Washington announced that he would not run for a third term. But he did so with a warning, possibly with Adet in mind, against the \u201cinsidious wiles of foreign influence.\u201d\n\nWith Washington out of the picture, Adet began to openly advocate for the election of Thomas Jefferson as the next president. A week before Pennsylvania chose its crucial slate of presidential electors, Adet published a letter suggesting that only Jefferson\u2019s election could avert war with France. Though his superiors had authorized him to share France\u2019s newly aggressive policy much earlier, Adet timed his announcement to maximize its electoral effect.\n\nThis stunt may have backfired. Many Americans reacted furiously to Adet\u2019s implication. One newspaper writer exhorted Americans to \u201cbe on your guard, this is the crisis, when foreign powers will make their great effort to secure a lasting influence over your affairs and Direct Your Government.\u201d Another essayist, signing his name \u201cNational Pride,\u201d remarked, \u201cIf the choice of a President of the United States is to depend on any Act of a foreign nation, farewell to your liberties and independence.\u201d Numerous observers claimed that Adet\u2019s efforts cost Jefferson more support than it gained him.\n\nIn the end, Jefferson narrowly lost the election to John Adams and Franco-American relations further deteriorated into what became known as the \u201cQuasi-War.\u201d Unable to sustain a diplomatic pretense for their involvement in American politics, the French government ended its direct support for the Democratic-Republican opposition.\n\nBut this did not stop fear of foreign meddling in the elections of 1798 and 1800.\n\nThe notorious XYZ Affair of 1798 raised these concerns anew. That year, a French diplomat named Pierre Bellamy appeared to ask American envoys in Paris for a bribe to continue negotiations to prevent a war between the two nations. After they refused his offer, Bellamy warned that France could use its \u201cdiplomatic skill\u201d in America to mobilize its \u201cFrench party\u201d against the Federalists.\n\nGen\u00eat, Fauchet and Adet\u2019s inappropriate actions provided a context in which Federalists could magnify Bellamy\u2019s taunt into wild and unfounded allegations about French interference in the elections not just that year, but also in 1800. They began to refer to their opponents, as Bellamy had done, as the \u201cFrench Party.\u201d Some even claimed that a shadowy French branch of the Free Masons known as the \u201cIlluminati\u201d sought to manipulate American political institutions.\n\nIn the late 1790s, despite the absence of direct meddling, Americans argued more forcefully than ever against foreign involvement in elections. One newspaper writer explained that \u201cit is the vital principle of a republic to repel from its elections all foreign interference.\u201d Another produced a second Declaration of Independence announcing a separation from France that listed among France\u2019s \u201crepeated injuries and usurpations\u201d that \u201cshe has interfered in our elections and attempted to gain a dangerous ascendancy in our Councils.\u201d\n\nThese Americans understood that allowing a foreign adversary to determine the outcome of elections would mean the death of their experiment in democracy. Without integrity in elections, there could be no legitimate representation in government.\n\nA similar dynamic has begun to unfold today. Russian intrusion in the 2016 presidential election has fueled doubts about the legitimacy of the American electoral system. Further interference from foreign nations will only invite conspiracy theorizing about future elections, undermining faith in this pillar of representative government.\n\nIn fact, the ostensible beneficiary of such meddling, Jefferson, would later discover the downside of the practice. While Jefferson could have condemned or prevented Adet\u2019s actions, he apparently chose not to because of the potential political benefits to himself. He criticized such foreign interference only when it was against his party. During the War of 1812, he suspected without evidence that the British government had paid New Englanders to oppose his friend James Madison\u2019s administration and to even organize a secession movement.\n\nAs with many Republican leaders today, foreign meddling in American politics bothered Jefferson little when it benefited him. Yet Republicans may find, as Jefferson did, that future external electoral interference could harm their party\u2019s interests. Abiding by the principle that American elections belong only to Americans is both just and practical.", "description": "The origins of our efforts to keep foreign countries out of our elections.", "authors": ["Jordan E.
