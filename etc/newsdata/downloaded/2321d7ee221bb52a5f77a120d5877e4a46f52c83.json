In the past, they've had Zaki Ibrahim cover Leonard Cohen, Arkells cover Owen Pallett, and Weaves cover Arcade Fire.\n\nToday, Polaris has released another brand new cover: 2018 nominee Partner putting its own spin on \"Limelight,\" off Rush's 1981 Heritage Prize-winning album, Moving Pictures. The cover stays fairly faithful to the original as singer Jos\u00e9e Caron does her best Geddy Lee impersonation, capturing some of Lee's vocal flair.\n\n\"We love you, Rush,\" bassist Lucy Niles exclaimed in the video. \"You seem like the coolest people ever.\"\n\nWatch Partner's cover of Rush's \"Limelight\" below.\n\nFor more coverage of the Polaris Music Prize, head over to cbcmusic.ca/polaris. The 2019 Polaris gala, where the winner is determined by a grand jury, will take place on Monday, Sept. 16.", "description": "'We love you, Rush.
