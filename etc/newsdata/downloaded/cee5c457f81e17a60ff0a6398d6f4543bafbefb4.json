(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nMiles Mikolas turned to the Washington Nationals\u2019 dugout, chewed his gum and grabbed his crotch. The St. Louis Cardinals starter, having escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fifth inning of the National League Championship Series opener, seemed to be telling the hitter he had just retired that he didn\u2019t appreciate his antics. The gesture was appreciated by the player who instigated it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to laugh about it,\u201d Juan Soto said.\n\n[An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez\u2019s near-no-hitter gives Nationals 2-0 win over Cardinals in Game 1 of NLCS]\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 20-year-old phenom had adjusted himself toward Mikolas earlier in the at-bat as part of the elaborate between-pitch routines he began as a minor leaguer. Soto used to say it was a personal thing, what has become known as the \u201cSoto shuffle.\u201d Most often it looks like this: He squats in his stance and sweeps his feet through the batter\u2019s box in a sort of solo, sidewinding salsa. He stirs up dirt and \u2014 sometimes \u2014 trouble with the pitcher, a byproduct of something bigger happening in baseball. But he always has insisted he needs the routine for practical purposes because it syncs up his timing. He can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a tic.\n\nBut then, a few days ago in Los Angeles, Soto revealed an ulterior motive.\n\n\u201cI like to get in the minds of the pitchers,\u201d Soto said. \u201cBecause sometimes they get scared.\u201d\n\nIt worked in the minors, so he continued it in the big leagues. On Friday, in the Nationals\u2019 2-0 win, Soto did more than a simple leg sweep. He took some moves from his post-take routine throughout the season \u2014 stepping forward to hack a huge practice cut, wiggling his upper body and grabbing his cup \u2014 and turned them up. He pawed at the dirt, shimmied his shoulders and grinned. He licked his lips at Mikolas after the veteran right-hander missed with a curveball. He had done something similar to Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader before delivering the decisive hit in the eighth inning of Washington\u2019s wild-card win. It wound up turning the Nationals\u2019 first NLCS game into a junk-holstering contest on national television.\n\nFellow major league players, watching from the couches like everyone else, noticed. \u201cMikolas did it back to Soto. Who saw it?\u201d Andrew McCutchen tweeted.\n\n\u201cI was just having fun,\u201d Mikolas said later, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s a great hitter; great hitters have routines. That\u2019s part of his routine, his shtick.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez shuts down Cardinals, puts Nationals in command of NLCS]\n\nThe shuffle figured to sharpen into focus in the NLCS because it fundamentally conflicts with a brand of baseball traditionalism embodied by the Cardinals. Mikolas might\u2019ve played it off as a laugh, but St. Louis has several veteran players, such as catcher Yadier Molina, starter Adam Wainwright and reliever Carlos Mart\u00ednez, who hold sacred baseball\u2019s \u201cunwritten rules.\u201d Cardinals fans do, too \u2014 Soto was heavily booed when he walked back to the plate after a botched bunt attempt in the fourth inning. The most notable of those invisible commandments around the league this season is \u201cdon\u2019t admire a home run,\u201d and Soto\u2019s shuffle seems to violate the \u201cDon\u2019t show anyone up\u201d rule. This tests the Cardinals, who have already established themselves as this postseason\u2019s anti-showboat task force.\n\nTensions escalated between Mart\u00ednez and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., the Atlanta Braves\u2019 young star, after Acu\u00f1a was slow around the bases following a home run off the closer in Game 1 of the teams\u2019 NLDS. Acu\u00f1a had been criticized before for similar perceived violations of the unwritten rules. Pittsburgh Pirates announcer and former pitcher Steve Blass notably intimated pitchers might have thrown at Acu\u00f1a \u201cback in the day\u201d for \u201call the jewelry and all the stuff.\u201d Mart\u00ednez finished Game 1 by screaming at the Braves\u2019 dugout, and he told reporters of Acu\u00f1a: \u201cI wanted him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran player.\u201d Mart\u00ednez later added he was emotional following the recent death of someone close to him in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe friction never subsided \u2014 Mart\u00ednez threw up-and-in twice when he faced Acu\u00f1a in Game 3 \u2014 and the situation hinted toward clashes around the league between styles of play. Soto understood these customs and the Cardinals\u2019 position because in the two series between the teams this season, Molina had chirped at Soto for spending too much time out of the box between pitches. But Soto sees an advantage in landscaping, so he refused to give it up. Teammates recommended he dial it back. He decided to pick his spots.\n\n[Nationals\u2019 playoff march feels more and more like Capitals\u2019 Stanley Cup run (no jinx)]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying right now,\u201d Soto said. \u201cEverybody wants to get the job done [in big moments], and if you get a little bit of that [intimidation] and get a little bit comfortable with that [shuffle] . . . you get one step in front.\u201d\n\nNationals Manager Dave Martinez anticipated this approach might not go over well. When asked before Game 1 what he thought about it as an old-school player himself, he started, \u201cI thought, you know . . . it\u2019s a little, you know . . .\u201d He stopped.\n\n\u201cBut then, after talking to him and watching him, it\u2019s a routine that he uses to get to the next pitch,\u201d Martinez continued. \u201cI mean, when you talk to him he really feels like that\u2019s his batter\u2019s box, he owns that batter\u2019s box. And when he does that, it\u2019s basically just saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to get back in here and I\u2019m going to get ready to hit the next pitch.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhat was a big deal Friday night sometimes isn\u2019t because of the personalities involved as players police themselves. In the second half of last season, Soto shuffled against An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, a Braves starter who signed with the Nationals last offseason and out-dueled Mikolas in Game 1. The move surprised the veteran right-hander. He had never seen anything like it.\n\n[MLB playoff bracket and schedule]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 \u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cI thought this guy was going to fight with me. It was kind of funny to me at that point.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez, as relaxed as they come, started laughing. He couldn\u2019t stop and eventually Soto joined in. Soto never got a hit off S\u00e1nchez in six tries, so he stopped shuffling. He noticed later that, whenever S\u00e1nchez saw him on a non-start day, he jokingly shuffled back at the rookie.\n\nThe moment with Mikolas, in retrospect, was like that for Soto. He didn\u2019t begrudge Mikolas\u2019s gesture because the pitcher had gotten him out. Whatever respect the two players forged, Busch Stadium\u2019s scrutiny on Soto still intensified. He heard louder boos than any other National when he walked to the plate later in the game, but he never let up.\n\nIn the ninth, after a wild pitch, Soto jogged toward second and tip-toed the last few steps. He put his right foot on the base, swung his head right, then left, then right again, looking at the infielders. It was as if he wanted to remind them he was here to stay.\n\nMatt Crossman contributed reporting to this story.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nNLCS preview: Nationals\u2019 new kids on the block meet the Cardinals\u2019 old guard\n\nClayton Kershaw, of all people, let the Nationals back into Game 5\n\nHow Stephen Strasburg became virtually unhittable at the perfect time\n\nJuan Soto is a very quick learner.
