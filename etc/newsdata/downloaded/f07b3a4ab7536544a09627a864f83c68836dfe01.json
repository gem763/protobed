However, China will likely perceive the two as being connected, according to Matthew Goodman, senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to complicate the discussions this week\u2026the timing is going to be awkward for the Chinese,\u201d Goodman told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Commerce Department stated that the entities targeted by the blacklist \u201chave been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\u201d\n\nThe entities include Megvii Technology Inc., Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, and SenseTime Group Ltd., all of which specialize in facial recognition technology and video surveillance.\n\nThe export blacklist bars U.S. suppliers from providing technology to any of the targeted firms without a license. While the move by the Commerce Department carries symbolic value, the blacklist is not projected to significantly harm the targeted firms as American companies do not form an integral part of their supply chain.\n\nChina-U.S. relations were already put in a sensitive position this week after the manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team tweeted in support of Hong-Kong democracy protesters, prompting the official Chinese basketball association to severe ties with the team.\n\nNBA officials tried to contain the fallout by apologizing for Morey\u2019s intrusion into Chinese politics, but were then accused by U.S. officials of kowtowing to Beijing. Senator Ted Cruz (R., Tex.) said that the NBA was \u201cassisting Chinese communist censorship\u201d and Senator Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) sent a letter to Silver chastising the league for backing down in the face of Chinese censorship.", "description": "The U.S. placed 28 Chinese firms on an export blacklist, citing their role in the repression of China's Uighur Muslim minority.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
