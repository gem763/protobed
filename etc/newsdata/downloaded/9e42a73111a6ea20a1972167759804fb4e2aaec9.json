We\u2019ve been testing removers that make quick work of even waterproof eye make-up, so the job can be done as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nThere are a few different formulas here, from creams to pens, but most are the classic thin liquid that you sweep over skin on a cotton pad (more on those later).\n\nWhile testing we looked for products that removed make-up, particularly mascara and long-wear liquid eyeliner, without requiring lots of pressure and rubbing on the sensitive eye area; we also discounted any that caused stinging and irritation.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It combines, as the name suggests, two textures, water and oil, to dissolve and whisk away waterproof mascara, without leaving behind residue, irritating eyes or stripping moisture. Remember to give the bottle a shake first to combine the water and oil, which separate when settled.\n\nBuy now\n\nClinique take the day off make-up remover: \u00a319, John Lewis & Partners\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that we like the eye make-up remover from Clinique\u2019s \u201ctake the day off\u201d range, given how devoted we are to the cleansing balm and cleansing milk from the same line. It\u2019s efficient, gentle enough for sensitive skin and leaves just enough oil behind to feel hydrating but no greasy film of product on the skin.\n\nBuy now\n\nNivea double effect eye make-up remover: \u00a33.59, Superdrug\n\nA good dupe of Lancome\u2019s iconic but pricey remover, Nivea\u2019s double effect uses oil to remove even waterproof mascara but combines it with water to wash away residue and keep things kind and easy on your eyes. Don\u2019t forget to shake the bottle before using to get the best of both worlds.\n\nBuy now\n\nLa Roche-Posay toleriane dermo-cleanser: \u00a312.50, La Roche-Posay\n\nFor an alternative formula to the usual watery removers, La Roche-Posay\u2019s is a thin milk that feels gentle and nourishing. Apply it with a cotton pad, as you would with any other remover. We didn\u2019t find it quite as efficient on waterproof make-up as others we tested, but it is perfect for dry and sensitive skin types. Dermo-cleanser is technically designed to be used on your whole face, not just your eyes, but we\u2019d still recommend you double cleanse with an oil and cream wash instead to remove foundation.\n\nBuy now\n\nESPA bio-active eye cleanser: \u00a321, John Lewis & Partners\n\nMost eye make-up removers are all business, but Espa\u2019s feels like a little bit of skincare as well as being an efficient hard-worker. It requires hardly any pressure to remove mascara, and it also contains moisturising hyaluronic acid and conditioning rose water, so your eye area and lashes get a treat, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nElf make-up remover pen: \u00a34.50, Elf Cosmetics\n\nIf your make-up skills are sometimes a little\u2026 outside the lines, Elf\u2019s genius pen is perfect for removing product from small areas. We use ours to clean up our liquid eyeliner flicks, correct when we\u2019ve been a little overzealous with overlining lipstick, and to save the day when a sneeze has left mascara under our eyes.\n\nBuy now\n\nGarnier express 2in1 eye make-up remover: \u00a32.33, Boots\n\nGarnier\u2019s 2in1 is another remover that employs the powerful combination of oil and water, but this one is our pick for sensitive eyes. Our contact lens-wearing tester, who finds most products sting unbearably, loves this for its gentle but effective results.\n\nBuy now\n\nBobbi Brown instant long-wear make-up remover: \u00a319.50, Bobbi Brown\n\nFor make-up that is designed to stay put all day and then some, only the strong stuff will do. Bobbi Brown\u2019s remover whisks away stubborn waterproof make-up, including hard-dried liquid liner, with no heavy rubbing or lashes lost. It also leaves skin super soft.\n\nBuy now\n\nMakeUp Eraser: \u00a316.99, Feel Unique\n\nOK, we\u2019ll admit that we have absolutely no idea how this works, but it does. This soft microfibre face towel removes all make-up, including waterproof mascara, just with added water \u2013 no other product needed \u2013 and bung it in the washing machine when it needs a clean. It\u2019s quite amazing. We\u2019re not convinced we\u2019ll be swapping it for our traditional remover just yet, but it\u2019s definitely a great option for travelling \u2013 and lazy days.\n\nBuy now\n\nTabitha Eve organic make-up rounds: \u00a35.50, Tabitha Eve\n\nReduce your waste by swapping your usual disposable cotton pads for Tabitha Eve\u2019s super soft cotton rounds. Use them as you would a cotton pad to remove your eye make-up, then simply pop them in the washing machine and reuse.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Make-up removers\n\nLancome\u2019s bi-facial is a cult product for a reason: its formula is brilliantly creative and it works. But for a good stand-in at a sixth of the price, you can\u2019t go wrong with Nivea\u2019s double effect.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
