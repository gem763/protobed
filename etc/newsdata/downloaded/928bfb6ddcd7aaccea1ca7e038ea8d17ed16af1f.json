We owe a very great debt and we hold in the highest esteem the work of our armed forces and indeed our intelligence services.\n\n'The great thing about our intelligence service is that they don't wear uniforms, they don't wear medals, they even go home sometimes and tell their wives and husbands slight untruths about what they did during the day.\n\n'They don't do it for recognition, glamour or parade. In my experience, they do it for those amazing British values that we hold dear.\n\nFrench Ambassador Catherine Colonna with veteran Geoffrey Pidgeon (left) during the medal ceremony today\n\nGeoffrey Pidgeon speaks during the medal ceremony at Lancaster House in London today\n\n'I know that Geoffrey fulfils those qualities.'\n\nBefore presenting the award, Ms Colonna said France presented the Legion d'Honneur with 'a deep sense of gratitude' for the work Mr Pidgeon did.\n\nShe added: 'This ceremony is a tribute for all those who worked for peace, justice and freedom in the world.\n\n'Our country will never forget the fortitude and neither shall we.'\n\nIn Mr Pidgeon's acceptance speech, he thanked his son John for submitting his award application on his behalf, and addressing the French ambassador, he said: 'I am truly honoured to thank you, and through you France, for this most prestigious award.\n\nBefore presenting the award, Ms Colonna said France presented the Legion d'Honneur with 'a deep sense of gratitude' for the work Mr Pidgeon (pictured) did\n\nAsked how it felt receiving the award, Mr Pidgeon said: 'It feels quite strange at the moment, especially as I was not expecting this'\n\n'There are hundreds and hundreds of more worthy recipients from those awarded but perhaps few from SOE and even fewer from MI6.
