UPDATE 2-Oil rises as Saudi signals OPEC cuts to continue under new minister\n\n* Brent, WTI rise around 1%\n\n* Saudi Arabia appoints royal as energy minister\n\n* Interactive graphic on U.S. rig count: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XdttIW\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Aaron Sheldrick\n\nTOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Monday on expectations\n\nthat Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will\n\ncontinue to support output cuts by OPEC and other producers to\n\nprop up prices under new Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin\n\nSalman.\n\nPrices climbed for a fourth day and were also supported by\n\ncomments from the United Arab Emirates' energy minister that\n\nOPEC and its allies are committed to balancing the crude market.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent was up 61 cents, or 1%, at\n\n$62.15 a barrel by 0649 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate\n\nwas up 65 cents, or 1.2%, at $57.17 a barrel.\n\nSalman, a long-time member of the Saudi delegation to the\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was named\n\nminister on Sunday, replacing Khalid al-Falih. He is the son of\n\nSaudi King Salman. It is the first time the energy portfolio has\n\nbeen handed to a member of the royal family.\n\nHe helped to negotiate the current global agreement on\n\nsupply cuts between OPEC and non-OPEC countries including\n\nRussia, a group known as OPEC+.\n\nA Saudi official said on Sunday there would be no shift in\n\nSaudi and OPEC policy. \"The change at the top doesn't necessarily mean a shift in\n\npolicy as much as it's being viewed as a move to improve\n\nrelations within OPEC and with non-OPEC producers in the wake of\n\nthe latest Russian compliance fissures,\" said Stephen Innes,\n\nAsia Pacific market strategist at Axi Trader.\n\nRussia's oil output in August exceeded its quota under the\n\nOPEC+ agreements. UAE Energy and Industry Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on\n\nSunday that members of OPEC and non-OPEC producers were\n\n\"committed\" to achieving oil market balance. Trade and geopolitical tensions are affecting the market\n\nmore than demand and supply, Mazrouei said, but he was quick to\n\nrule out hasty steps influenced by the trade war between the\n\nUnited States and China.\n\n\"The fear of slower (oil) demand is only going to happen if\n\nthat tension is escalating and I am personally hopeful that is\n\nnot the case,\" Mazrouei told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nPrices on Monday were also supported by a rise in oil\n\nimports in China in August, with shipments to the world's\n\nbiggest importer up 3% from July and nearly 10% higher in the\n\nfirst eight months of 2019 from a year earlier. In the United States, drilling companies cut the number of\n\noperating oil rigs for a third week in a row last week.\n\nCHART: U.S. oil may rise into $57.87-$58.59 range L3N2600MZ\n\nCHART: Brent oil may rise further into $62.60-$63.35 range\n\nL3N260067\n\nU.S. Rig count png https://tmsnrt.rs/2X8Myf7\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-Oil rises as Saudi signals OPEC cuts to continue under new minister", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/339aff14abd304bc4fcbe5ebf4b6eb1b_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
