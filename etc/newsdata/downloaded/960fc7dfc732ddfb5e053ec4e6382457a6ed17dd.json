One of the longer lead-time items of the restoration are Abqaiq\u2019s stabilization towers that separates out the dissolved gas from the crude oil\u2014a distillation process that sweetens sour crude, if you will.\n\nJust the specialized parts to repair those towers could take months to get. Five out of the 18 stabilization towards were hit, indicating a \u201cvery specific, accurate targeting of those particular infrastructures,\u201d Phillip Cornell, former senior corporate planning adviser to Aramco, cited by Bloomberg.\n\nAbqaiq has a capacity of 5.7 million barrels per day of light crude.\n\nTo compensate, Aramco is bringing back online previously shuttered oilfields, and it is drawing on its oil reserves to cushion the blow. What can\u2019t be compensated for by cranking up idled fields and siphoning off crude reserves is being satisfied by substituting a heavier grade oil\u2014but all these emergency measures have limits.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s stockpiles are only sufficient enough to last 26 days, according to Rystad Energy, so if the outage were to last \u201cmonths\u201d rather than days or weeks, customers may actually feel the supply crunch.\n\nThe Abqaiq oilfield was attacked on Saturday, for which the Houthi\u2019s have taken responsibility. The United States, however, has placed the blame squarely on Iran.\n\nOil prices reacted violently to the attack, sending WTI and Brent crude both up more than 14% by mid-afternoon. WTI was trading at $62.59 while Brent was trading at $68.95 at 2:27pm EDT.\n\nBy Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Energy Aspects\u2019 chief oil analyst Amrita Sen doesn\u2019t expected Saudi oil production to fully recover for weeks or even months following the attacks on Saturday", "authors": ["Julianne Geiger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
