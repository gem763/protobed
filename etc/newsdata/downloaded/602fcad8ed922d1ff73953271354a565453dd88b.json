Or even better, once your friend is done spending time with their partner, you can offer to hang out after, thereby making yourself, your friend and your friend's partner happy.\n\nPexels\n\nAnother great way to get out of a third-wheel situation is by letting your friend know how you want to spend one -on -one quality time with them. This is bound to melt anyone's heart. By speaking about alone bonding sessions, you are letting your friend know that they are important to you. And you avoid the risk of appearing as thought you are trying to get out of spending time with them as a couple.\n\nYou can bring this up by saying something like, \"I love your boyfriend/girlfriend, but I also really love our together time, when it's just you and me. Can we sometimes make separate plans and just hang out?\" This is bound to received better than you blatantly saying no for every time.\n\nJust remember, the best way to handle a third-wheel situation without hurting the sentiments of all three parties involved is by striking a balance between seeing the couple together and seeing your friend alone.\n\nPexels\n\nAlso, it's wise to always keep in mind, that sometimes third-wheel dates don't always have to be boring. For one thing, you can invite another friend or a date with the three of you for a double date and end up having a really good time. Also, just remember that if you are constantly being invited on third-wheel dates by your friend, it's their way of bringing two people who are really important to them, together. You can use this time to get to know your friend's partner and understand what makes them so special to your friend.\n\nAnd since opposites attract, there's a high chance you might find an interest in common with your friend's partner. You three can spend time fulfilling all those interests together. So go ahead, have a good time with the couple when you want, and say no when you must, in the most polite and kind way, like stated above.
