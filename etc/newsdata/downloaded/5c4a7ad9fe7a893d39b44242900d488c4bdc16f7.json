I\u2019ll read them out: The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the people who make and sell cars; the Chemical Industries Association; the Food and Drink Federation; the Association for British Pharmaceutical Industry; and the Aerospace trade industry body. A lot of people who are actually at the forefront of trying to make this country earn its place in the world sent a letter to the government which I will now read out part of to you.\n\n\u2018They said that this proposal is a serious risk to manufacturing competitiveness, and will result in huge new costs and disruption to UK firms.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t see why you\u2019re laughing.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s got the potential to risk consumer and food safety and confidence, access to overseas markets for UK exporters, and vital future investment in innovation in this country.\u2019\n\nMs Patel did not respond to the laughing claim, but told him: \u2018This is why the government has been working assiduously \u2013 with business as well I should say \u2013 across a range of sectors when it comes to planning for our exit from the European Union.\u2019\n\n.Accept she is neither smiling or laughing. I guess some people are so incensed at the thought of a Gov that is upholding the Democratic will of the people,they are willing to use any means necessary to demonise its Ministers. Maybe @AndrewMarr9 can apologise to @patel4witham now \u2014 Nadhim Zahawi (@nadhimzahawi) October 13, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNadhim Zahawi responded online saying: \u2018I guess some people are so incensed at the thought of a Gov that is upholding the democratic will of the people,they are willing to use any means necessary to demonise its ministers.\n\n\u2018Maybe Andrew Marr can apologise to Priti Patel now.\u2019\n\nThose online were split over whether she deserved the rebuke or not.\n\nVictoria Drummond wrote: \u2018No she wasn\u2019t laughing. But she was smirking. Which shows how arrogant and insulting her attitude is to thought of industries leaving or going bust and people becoming unemployed.\u2019\n\nAnother user wrote: \u2018It really is the expression of a person who is trying to hold in a laugh. Which is worse than an outright laugh in this case.\u2019\n\nHowever, Patrick O\u2019Flynn wrote that she was \u2018barely smiling. Only in a Mona Lisa type of way \u2013 is she or isn\u2019t she? \u2013 perhaps. Marr\u2019s outburst was unfair, being totally wrong.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
