(NASDAQ: ) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2020 results on Oct 30.\n\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the company expects revenues between $300 million and $340 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $312.13 million, indicating a drop of 12.33% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 95 cents, suggesting a 12% decline from the year-earlier reported number.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 108.08%.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of 37 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents as well as the prior-year figure of 28 cents.\n\nTotal revenues of $238 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $222 million. However, the top line was down 6.4% year over year and 1% sequentially as well due to weaker sales of portable audio products shipping in smartphones, digital headsets and adapters.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nCirrus Logic\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2020 results are likely to benefit from the company\u2019s strong product portfolio comprising audio, voice and other adjacent market items, such as haptics.\n\nThe company is likely to have gained from its steadfast execution target, a wider customer base and efforts to capitalize on solid demand for powerful audio and voice components.\n\nRobust design momentum with the existing and new customers across its product portfolio might reflect on the numbers as an upside.\n\nFurther, the company\u2019s growing share in the Android market and new product development activities are expected to have been steady key catalysts. With Apple (NASDAQ: ) adopting new custom smart codecs for latest iPhones, content growth is likely to have been boosted.\n\nHowever, Cirrus Logic\u2019s heavy dependence on Apple is a point of concern. Persistent decline in iPhone sales is likely to have posed a key threat to its top-line results. Moreover, slowing growth at Samsung (KS: ) might have been a downside.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cirrus Logic this time around.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nCirrus Logic\u2019s Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00% make surprise prediction difficult.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some stocks worth considering as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases:\n\nAdvanced Energy Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank of 1. The company is slated to release quarterly results on Nov 12.

Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.\n\nSee the pot trades we're targeting>>", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Zacks Investment Research covering: Apple Inc, Advanced Energy Industries Inc, Cirrus Logic Inc, Meet Group Inc.
