His electric vehicle (EV), a Hyundai Kona, which he had been using since December last year, will be used by the city government as a public vehicle.The city government has 255 public EVs and two hydrogen-powered vehicles.Seoul Metropolitan Government said it will be subsidizing over 4,000 buyers of hydrogen-powered cars into 2022.Since last year, the city government has funded up to 35 million won ($29,861) per individual who bought a hydrogen vehicle, which, the city government said, covers about half the cost of a Hyundai Nexo.As of this year, it has supported 591 buyers of hydrogen vehicles, according to the city government.\u201cSo far, Seoul has had more people than other areas who want to buy hydrogen-powered cars - some of them had to wait up to a year before the cars became available,\u201d the city government said. \u201cOur support should help open up more hydrogen cars into the market.\u201dThere are three hydrogen vehicle charging stations in Seoul, located in Yeouido, western Seoul, Sangam-dong in Mapo District, western Seoul, and in Yangjae-dong, Seocho District, southern Seoul.\u201cWe will also be building more infrastructures for hydrogen vehicles,\u201d Park said.The city government plans to build additional charging stations, to have 10 available in the city by 2020.\u201cIf an EV can run for 180 to 406 kilometers [111 to 252 miles] after a half an hour of charging, then a hydrogen car can run for 609 kilometers after five-minutes of charging,\u201d the city government said in its statement. \u201cBoth EVs and hydrogen cars have zero carbon footprint.\u201dBY ESTHER CHUNG, PARK HAE-LEE [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
