A law to block a no-deal Brexit will be in place on Monday \u2013 imposing a legal duty to seek an Article 50 extension if no agreement has been reached by 19 October.\n\nAs Tony Blair put it, rather painfully: \u201cJeremy Corbyn has the most sensitive parts of Johnson\u2019s political anatomy in his hands. Johnson cannot move without his consent.\u201d So, after a calamitous week for the prime minister, what are his options?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

However, EU leaders might just shrug their shoulders \u2013 so Mr Johnson would still be sanctioning an extension.\n\nTry to pass a Brexit deal\n\nTheresa May\u2019s agreement is dead and buried, but gathering dust is the EU\u2019s willingness for the hated Irish backstop to apply to Northern Ireland only, not the whole UK.

The Supreme Court would be summoned, civil servants would go on strike and Mr Johnson could be jailed. But Dominic Cummings, his \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d (David Cameron) aide, is no doubt up for it.\n\nResign\n\nWhat?! Quit, after just six weeks in office \u2013 it seems crazy but is increasingly viewed as a way out. By walking out of No 10 \u2013 perhaps after declaring no confidence in himself \u2013 while remaining Conservative leader, some other caretaker PM is dipped in the Brussels blood, leaving Mr Johnson\u2019s clean to fight the election to follow, possibly in late November.\n\nHe may be a cornered rat \u2013 but we should probably remember that they are said to be the most dangerous.", "description": "The gleeful opposition parties believe Boris Johnson is a cornered rat \u2013 unable to call the election he craves and facing the humiliation of having to beg for a further Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/08/boris-johnson-yorkshire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
