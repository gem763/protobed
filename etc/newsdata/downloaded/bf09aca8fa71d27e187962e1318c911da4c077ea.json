Since then, a coalition of 24 state attorneys general, including California, launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration.\n\nFor decades, California has been issued waivers to allowing it to set air pollution standards higher than that of the federal government due to its unique and significant struggle with air pollution and smog. A dozen other states and the District of Columbia follow its fuel economy standards.\n\nFour car companies \u2014 Honda, Volkswagen, Ford and BMW \u2014 have already pledged to meet stronger tailpipe emissions standards, despite the rollback effort.", "description": "Several auto companies, including General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and others, are siding with the Trump administration in the legal battle over whether California has the authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/california_auto_emissions_09032019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
