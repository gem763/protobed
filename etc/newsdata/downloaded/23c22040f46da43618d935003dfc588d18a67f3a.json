We stood it on a patch of gravel near the house while we decided on the best place for it. Time passed and when we tried to move it, we discovered to our horror that a major root had found its way out of the bottom of the pot and into the ground.\n\nMore time passed and the pot eventually cracked, giving us a dilemma. Dare we risk just cutting off the root and moving the tree? It could stay in situ since my husband says he can build a wooden \u201ccontainer\u201d which we could back-fill with ericaceous compost. But it would need to be pruned \u2013 when and how?\n\nPeter and Judith \u2013 via email\n\nYou are not the first and will...", "description": "HOUDINI ROOTS", "authors": ["Helen Yemm"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2018/08/02/TELEMMGLPICT000170609804-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg", "published_at": "2018-08-02"}
