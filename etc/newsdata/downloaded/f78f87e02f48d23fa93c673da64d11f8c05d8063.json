There are far too many people who have the type 2 condition due to an irresistible urge to eat too much and a refusal to exercise\n\nIn his ham-fisted way, Hollywood had managed to highlight the huge distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe former is an auto-immune condition where the body attacks its own insulin-producing cells; it often strikes in childhood and has nothing to do with lifestyle.\n\nType 2 tends to develop later in life, affects 90 per cent of all diabetes sufferers and is commonly brought on by obesity and a bad diet.\n\nOf course, I understand why those living with type 1 vented their fury \u2014 after all, their suffering isn\u2019t connected in any way with how many creams buns they might have eaten.\n\nYet here I am defending The Great British Bake Off judge after he was pilloried on social media for saying a G\u00e2teau St-Honor\u00e9 dessert made of caramelised, cream-filled choux buns, puff pastry and Chantilly cream was \u2018diabetes on a plate\u2019\n\nBut I do believe the social media storm is an over-reaction. We all knew what Hollywood meant.\n\nHe was simply saying in a jocular manner that eating vast numbers of calories is bad for you.\n\nIt\u2019s common parlance to describe a full English breakfast \u2014 fried bread, black pudding, the lot \u2014 as a heart attack on a plate. Is this really offensive to people who suffer from a heart condition unrelated to their diet?\n\nPerhaps in an age devoid of humour, one where outrage and victimhood are the default positions, it will be deemed so.\n\nOf course, I understand why those living with type 1 vented their fury \u2014 after all, their suffering isn\u2019t connected in any way with how many creams buns they might have eaten\n\nThe fact is Hollywood\u2019s diabetes joke spoke to an incontrovertible truth. There are far too many people who have the type 2 condition due to an irresistible urge to eat too much and a refusal to exercise.\n\nThe cost last year to the NHS of treating overweight or obese people was a fat-shaming \u00a36.1 billion.\n\nRecent studies confirm obesity is responsible for more cases of bowel, kidney, ovarian and kidney cancer than smoking.\n\nYet we now have the ridiculous situation in which patients complain they have been victimised when doctors point out that they\u2019d be better off dropping a few pounds.\n\nObesity is in danger of pulling down the whole NHS. And if one of TV\u2019s pantomime villains makes a crass joke pointing out the problem, it\u2019s no reason to throw the kitchen sink at him.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Hollywood\u2019s former girlfriend Summer Monteys-Fullam, 24, says she\u2019s hurt by claims she only bedded a rich, famous older guy for his money.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s so far from the truth. I worked so hard in the pub then I\u2019d go home and be a horse whisperer.\u2019 Nice work if you can get it.\n\nElle Macpherson reveals the secrets of keeping The Body bikini-ready at 55\n\nEllie's slim pickings\n\nElle Macpherson reveals the secrets of keeping The Body bikini-ready at 55.\n\nShe starts the day with hot water and lime, then fruit or raw oatmeal, washed down with one and a half pints of kale, cucumber, turmeric, garlic and lettuce juice from her organic garden.\n\nHer guilty secret is an occasional gluten-free vegetable pizza for supper.\n\nCrikey, if that\u2019s what it takes, I\u2019ll settle for a tummy-sucking-in one-piece \u2014 and keep going with the Quattro Formaggio pizzas.\n\nSilence is golden, Meg\n\nA bad week for the Sussexes after they tearfully railed against the pressure they suffer in their royal lives.\n\nMeghan said she \u2018really tried to adopt the British stiff upper lip\u2019 but gave up because it was \u2018probably really damaging\u2019.\n\nJolly good. Yet can I offer a sisterly tip as a fellow foreigner who made her home here?\n\nIf she can\u2019t do the stiff upper lip, perhaps she could try another British quirk \u2014 biting her lip.\n\nIn other words, as we say in Oz: \u2018Stop whingeing, Sheila.\u2019\n\nPrue sails into the sunset\n\nTimothy West and Prunella Scales have putt-putted through their last TV canal trip, her advancing Alzheimer\u2019s making it their final public voyage together.\n\nWhat a wonderful and loving insight this couple has given to those of us who have witnessed this disease first hand.\n\nAnd how sad that a new drug that can slow the disease came too late for Prunella or my Mum, who could both have had a few extra years knowing who their loved ones were and, more importantly, who they were.\n\nTimothy West and Prunella Scales have putt-putted through their last TV canal trip, her advancing Alzheimer\u2019s making it their final public voyage together\n\nDistraught when John Humphrys retired from Radio 4\u2019s Today, I\u2019m overjoyed to discover he\u2019s now doing a stint on Classic FM\u2019s morning show.\n\nIt means once again I will be able to wake up to the dulcet \u2014 or should that be hectoring? \u2014 tones of my most constant bedroom companion.\n\nHowever brave it was of Strictly\u2019s Shirley Ballas to reveal she was having her breast implants removed, I wonder whether she was wise to announce on The Jonathan Ross Show that after the operation on Tuesday, she\u2019ll be back in her head judge\u2019s seat for next Saturday\u2019s show.\n\nMay I humbly suggest that four days to recover from a serious procedure is not enough for any woman.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s one Strictly to miss it\u2019s the dreadful Halloween one with it\u2019s contrived theme of ghouls and goblins \u2014 we all hate it anyway.\n\nPictures of jihadi bride Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp pleading to come home are enough to melt the heart. Yet still I\u2019m undecided as to what should happen to her.\n\nAged just 20, she has lost three children, which is surely enough punishment for any soul.\n\nOn the other hand, we learned this week the Met has foiled 16 Islamist terrorist plots in Britain in the past two-and-a-half years.\n\nMaybe Shamima should stay there until we\u2019re sure who\u2019s side she\u2019s really on.\n\nPictures of jihadi bride Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp pleading to come home are enough to melt the heart. Yet still I\u2019m undecided as to what should happen to her\n\nKeep it hidden, Arnie\n\nAhead of the premiere of Terminator: Dark Fate, Arnold Schwarzenegger insisted he is as fit now at 72 as he was for the original and was desperate to reprise his opening scene back in 1984 when he arrived on planet Earth unclothed.\n\n\u2018I can still do that. I can still arrive naked.\u2019 Yes, Arnie, we\u2019re sure you could do it, but do we want to see it?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger insisted he is as fit now at 72 as he was for the original and was desperate to reprise his opening scene back in 1984 when he arrived on planet Earth unclothed. He is pictured above in the new movie\n\nWestminster Wars\n\nLabour has me on its mailing list, and I was sent an email from Diane Abbott saying: \u2018Amanda, if like me you\u2019re from an ethnic minority background I want to speak to you personally now.\u2019\n\nPerhaps she got confused thinking I was a Patel \u2014 as opposed to Platell. Alas, Diane, I\u2019m not BAME, although we do have one thing in common: an irresistible urge to slurp a tinny of mojito or G&T on public transport.\n\nTen points ahead in the polls, Boris is pushing for a December 12 election to end the parliamentary gridlock.\n\nGood luck with that, BoJo. Mrs May had a 20-point lead when she called the 2017 snap election \u2014 and lost her majority.\n\nOne result of an election will be that we see the back of two referendum betrayers.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow, who shamelessly colluded with Remainers to thwart Brexit is standing down as an MP. So is Oliver Letwin, who took a wrecking ball to both the May and Johnson deals.\n\nTeach ghouls respect\n\nAs the lorry which contained the 39 migrants who froze to death in unimaginable suffering passed by, Essex police officers lined the route and bowed their heads in respect \u2014 while onlookers filmed the poignant journey on their iPhones.\n\nEvery one of these voyeuristic ghouls should bow their heads \u2014 in shame.\n\nIn Germany recently, a traffic cop stopped a driver filming a fatal road crash, made him get out of his car to look at the broken body up close, before issuing him with a fixed penalty charge \u2014 then posting his own video of the driver on social media.\n\nA tough lesson, but perhaps the only way to teach mobile-obsessed morons the importance of respect.\n\nWayne Rooney celebrates his 34th birthday with three of his four sons in Barbados while long-suffering wife Coleen stays at home in Cheshire with their youngest.\n\nA bad infection stopped Col from travelling.
