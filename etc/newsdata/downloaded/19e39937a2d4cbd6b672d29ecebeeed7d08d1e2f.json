Geoff Dwight (second from right, aged seven), has accused Elton John (right) of vilifying their father Stanley (left) in his book, Me\n\n'I don\u2019t understand because my mum, my dad and me, we all went to see him as his guests in Liverpool,' Geoff told The Mirror. 'That was definitely a concert, my dad was definitely there, he was definitely playing and we definitely watched it. I was five.\n\n'Either he has got massive memory loss and he genuinely thinks his dad hasn\u2019t seen him in concert or maybe he wants to believe that.'\n\nElton writes in the book: 'I don\u2019t recall [my father] ever coming to see me play live, or talking about music with him. What I was doing clearly wasn\u2019t really his thing.'\n\nHe also claims that he was afraid of him.\n\nGeoff - who works as a carpenter and has a different mother to Elton, after Stanley split from first wife Sheila in 1962 and remarried second wife Edna and had four more sons with her - also insisted that Stanley was from a different generation, who were less generous with expressing their feelings.\n\nMemoirs: Elton has written an autobiography which is released on October 15\n\n'[Elton] is playing the blame card. But our parents came from war, where men had to be men and women had to be women. It\u2019s a different world,' Geoff said.\n\n''My dad... I can remember him saying \"I love you\" but it was on his deathbed. There were four of us brothers there \u2013 Elton wasn\u2019t. I said \"Dad, I love you\". And he said, \"Yes, love is what it is all about\". That generation just didn\u2019t express emotion in the same way we do now.\n\n'My dad was proud of him, you could see when Elton popped up on TV, his eyes lit up.'\n\nElton\u2019s spokesman said: 'Elton stands by what he said in the book about his dad never seeing him perform.'\n\nGeoff spoke earlier this year about the way his father was portrayed in the film biopic Rocketman.\n\nCentering around Elton's life, Geoff insisted that the movie vilifies their dad yet again and told the Mail this summer: 'That's not the Dad I remember. Dad had a big heart and he loved us all equally. He was incredibly proud of Elton and everything that he achieved.'\n\nEstranged: Geoff has barely been in contact with his brother, preferring to lead an alternative lifestyle in the small town of Ruthin in North Wales, where he hand-makes yurts and harps and organises music festivals\n\nAfter their father's death, Elton and Geoff lost touch. Geoff chooses to lead an alternative lifestyle in the small town of Ruthin in North Wales, where he hand-makes yurts and harps and organises music festivals.\n\nYet he felt the need to hit out against the way his family's history was seemingly rewritten in Rocketman.\n\n'As a kid, my memories of Dad are of him laughing and larking around. If one of us was upset, he'd do something silly like pretend to be a chimpanzee or he'd start tickling us,' Geoff said.\n\nIt means Geoff refutes Elton's long-time claim, almost the opening scene in Rocketman, that Stanley, then a Flight Lieutenant in the RAF, came home from a lengthy posting overseas and demanded dinner instead of racing upstairs for a reunion with his son.\n\n'I just cannot believe that,' says Geoff. 'Dad was the one who registered Elton's birth. He was there when Elton was born and he did not stop caring.'\n\nIn the film, the young Elton is shown heartbroken, waiting for his father in the half light at the top of the stairs.\n\nElton later shares this painful 'memory' with strangers during a group therapy session in rehab for drink and drugs, leaving viewers in no doubt about the emotional scars it left.\n\nCrucially, Geoff also believes the film is wrong about Stanley's lack of support for his eldest son's musical ambitions.\n\nIn Rocketman, when Elton's mother Sheila, Stanley's first wife, tells him their son is being put forward for a Royal Academy place, Stanley says disdainfully: 'Do you really think he has got that kind of talent?'\n\nAccording to Geoff, Stanley, who adored music, shared his passion with all his sons. 'It's rubbish to suggest otherwise,' he says.\n\nIn the movie: Stanley is portrayed as unenthusiastic about Elton pursuing a music career, but Geoff has rubbished these claims\n\n'Dad bought a piano for Elton and had it sent round to where he was living with his mother.' (This claim is backed by Edna who kept the \u00a368 receipt for the second-hand Collingwood pianoforte with its walnut finish.)\n\n'Dad encouraged all of us to be musical. He was in a swing band himself, so I see no reason why he'd have thwarted Elton.\n\n'I was hopeless on the piano so Dad left a guitar and a trumpet out for me with a few teach-yourself books. That doesn't sound like a man who discourages his kids.'\n\nMe: Elton's book is released this week\n\nThere is a pivotal scene in Rocketman where the teenage Elton is shown trying to connect with his father through music, rifling through his record collection and holding up an album for them to enjoy together.\n\nBut Stanley scolds him and instructs him never to touch the records without permission.\n\nThis, says Geoff, does ring true, for Stanley was proprietorial about his records, his toolbox and his favourite green armchair.\n\n'If Dad was out or at work, we'd all fight to sit in it but as soon as he got home he didn't even need to tell us to move, we'd leg it,' remembers Geoff.\n\nElton appears to have taken this trait of his father's as a personal insult, nursing his hurt into adulthood and adding it to his catalogue of Stanley's supposed rejections.\n\nThere are multiple other points at which Geoff's understanding of the Dwight family's past is at odds with what's depicted in the film.\n\nBiopic: As Rocketman, starring Taron Egerton (right), rewrites his own family history, Geoff feels he has to speak out in defence of their father (played by Steven Mackintosh, left)\n\nFor example, there's the moment the young Elton, clearly wrestling with the possibility that he might be gay, is humiliated when Stanley reprimands him for looking at dresses in his mother's magazine.\n\n'Dad didn't have a homophobic bone in his body,' says Geoff. 'When Elton came out, he didn't care, didn't even mention it because it wasn't important to him.'\n\nOr there's Stanley's supposed response when he discovered Sheila had been cheating on him.\n\nIn the film Stanley yells he's relieved because it gives him a good reason to divorce her and leave the family, which he did when Elton was 14. 'Again, not true,' says Geoff.\n\n'Dad was devastated when he found out she had been seeing another man. He went round to his house. Fred Farebrother was his name. [Fred later married Sheila.]\n\nOut of contact: Apart from exchanging the occasional Christmas card, Geoff has not sought a relationship with Elton since he was 16 [pictured several years ago during a time he lived in a garden shed]\n\n'When he knocked on the door, Fred scarpered out the back and he was invited in by the wife.\n\n'They chatted and I guess shared their sadness and Dad felt so sorry for her and her kids he ended up giving her a tenner before he left. That's what he always told us.'\n\nIn Rocketman, Stanley is shown walking out, icy calm, in a homburg and trench-coat without even looking back at his son, who is weeping at a bedroom window.\n\nIt's true that Geoff and Elton have had hugely disparate lives and that they make unlikely siblings \u2013 even though their physical resemblance is clear.\n\nWhile Elton toured the world making tens of millions of pounds and lavishing vast sums on homes, art, designer clothes and diamonds, Geoff dropped out of the private school to which he'd won an academic scholarship, wound up in jail for his part in a botched burglary and smoked a lot of weed. But he is not envious.\n\nDaddy dearest? Stanley Dwight is pictured with his second wife Edna Northcliffe in May 1976\n\n'There's no ill feeling from me towards Elton,' he says. 'Far from it. I love him but our paths have gone in different directions.'\n\nApart from exchanging the occasional Christmas card, he has not sought a relationship with Elton since he was 16 when he hitched a lift from North Wales to watch him perform in Manchester. 'I was wondering if one of you might turn up,' said the star dismissively.\n\nSince that tepid reunion, they have only spoken once which was when Geoff told him their father had died. Stanley was just 67 but suffering from complications brought on by heart disease. Geoff tried to broker a final meeting so the pair could make peace.\n\n'I went through the rigmarole of tracking Elton down through his label and management team, leaving messages everywhere, but by the time he got back to me, Dad was dead,' Geoff says.\n\n'He'd died the day before. I told him about the arrangements for the funeral and Elton just said, \"No Geoff, I'm not coming\".'\n\nInaccurate? There's a moment in film when the young Elton, clearly wrestling with the possibility that he might be gay, is humiliated when Stanley reprimands him for looking at dresses in his mother's magazine\n\nThe star later said it would have been hypocritical to go but to Geoff this does not make sense.\n\n'Dad could have been telling me a pack of lies about his relationship with Elton for all those years,' he says, 'but knowing Dad as I did, I doubt it. He never lied about anything and he and I were close.'\n\nThis is why he's so hurt seeing his father's memory traduced on film. What gives his account credibility is that it's not just his impressions of Stanley which are at odds with the biopic \u2013 it's the events in which he was involved as a child too.\n\nHalfway through the two-hour film, Elton is shown arriving at Stanley and Edna's suburban home on the Wirral in Merseyside where Stanley was by then working for Unilever at Port Sunlight.\n\nDismounting from his flashy Rolls-Royce, Elton offers his bewildered father a diamant\u00e9 encrusted Chopard watch as the then six-year-old Geoff looks on.\n\n'I've never seen or heard of this watch,' says Geoff today. Moments later, in a toe-curling scene, Stanley asks Elton to autograph an album for a friend at work. 'Not Dad's style,' says Geoff.\n\nElton has spoken in the past about what he feels he went through at the hands of his father, saying: 'He never told me he loved me, he didn't hold me, and he didn't come to see me perform'\n\nAs Elton leaves, Geoff and one of the other brothers rush out to wave goodbye but are shoo-ed back in by their father because they are in their stocking feet. The gulf between the lonely Elton driving away in the back of his Rolls and this warm vignette of family life could not be clearer.\n\n'But that is pure fiction too,' says Geoff. 'I remember it because it was the only time Elton came to see us.'\n\nHe rocked up in a chauffeur-driven, cream-coloured Rolls-Royce. We were very excited and we did go out into the street to see him off but Dad wouldn't have cared about whether or not we had shoes on. He wasn't like that.'\n\nElton has spoken in the past about what he feels he went through at the hands of his father.\n\nAddressing the Oxford Union four years ago, he said: 'He never told me he loved me, he didn't hold me, and he didn't come to see me perform.\n\n'He was taught that love had limits. You don't show it in public. You don't even show it in private.\n\nMoving on: Elton is pictured with mother Sheila and stepfather Fred Fairebrother at their apartment, London 1971\n\nAnd if your son isn't quite like you, and he's pretty f****** different from you in fact, then your love becomes cut off and inexpressible.'\n\nHe told how his father did not support his singing career and instead he wanted him to be a banker or civil servant: 'I've spent the rest of my life trying to prove to my father that I was a success. He's been dead [for] years and I'm still trying to prove the point. It stays with you.\n\n'And when we had our own children [Elton has two sons Zachary, eight, and Elijah, six, with husband David Furnish] I never stopped telling them I loved them and they never stop telling me they love me.'\n\nThese bitter claims have already been questioned by his biographer Philip Norman who has seen photos, letters and diaries belonging to Edna showing that Stanley did love and support Elton and that the myth of the abandoned son seems to have been fostered by Sheila in the aftermath of their divorce.\n\nMe hits shelves on October 15.", "description": "Elton John's brother has hit back at the singer for vilifying their father in his new autobiography.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19656658-0-image-a-43_1570975852745.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
