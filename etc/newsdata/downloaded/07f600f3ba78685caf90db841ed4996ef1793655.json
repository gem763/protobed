But a shift in consumer taste to more hulking vehicles is coming at the worst possible time.\n\nDemand for sport utility vehicles that initially took hold in America has spread across the globe, dramatically changing the product mix of carmakers along with their production footprint. Higher sales of the lucrative vehicles, while good for German manufacturers overall, threatens to hurt the workforce in factories at home that are heavily geared toward traditional sedans and hatchbacks.\n\nAt BMW AG, sales of SUVs made mostly in the U.S. account for 44% of all global deliveries, up from 24% a decade ago -- with a corresponding drop for models like the bread-and-butter 5-Series made at the Dingolfing plant near Munich. The trend is similar at Audi, which churns out SUVs mainly in Mexico, Hungary and Slovakia, and Mercedes, whose workers in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, can\u2019t make the massive GLE fast enough to satisfy demand.\n\nRecession, Trade Wars\n\nGermany\u2019s automotive industry, the largest employer with about 830,000 workers, is already straining under the biggest production drop in nearly a decade. That has helped push Europe\u2019s largest economy closer to recession. The decline, led by trade tensions and a slowing global economy, comes at a delicate time for an industry already facing a future when fewer hands will be needed to assemble battery-powered vehicles.\n\nA car\u2019s combustion engine alone counts more than 1,000 parts, compared with just a couple of dozen components in an electric motor that doesn\u2019t require an exhaust, transmission or fuel tank. The repercussions from the simpler setup cascade through the making of an electric car, with fewer people involved in development, testing, parts purchasing and service.\n\n\u201cThe SUV trend will certainly have implications for production structures,\u201d said Rolf Janssen, a partner at Roland Berger consultancy. \u201cFor workers, this adds additional pressure to the overall transformation trend.\u201d\n\nLike the pick-up truck, a model that\u2019s popular in the U.S. but largely absent from European roads, SUVs were a fringe phenomenon on the continent two decades ago. Instead, motorists aspired to own an Audi A3 or the Mercedes C-Class, while their larger luxury siblings chauffeured around captains of industry and politicians.\n\nMercedes set up shop in Alabama in 1995, making SUVs near consumers in a key market, while BMW\u2019s sprawling Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, its biggest globally, churns out X3 through X7 models. VW manufactures its T-Roc crossover, credited with lifting results in its most recent quarter, in Portugal, while the Audi Q7 and Q8 takes form in Slovakia and the Q3 in Hungary.\n\nForecaster LMC Automotive expects domestic German car production to sag to a 10-year low this year, with the export market in particular facing trouble. Justin Cox, director for global production at LMC, singled out Audi\u2019s Neckarsulm plant in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the Passat factory in Emden in northern Germany and VW\u2019s massive Wolfsburg site as vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe sedan localization issue isn\u2019t helping Germany,\u201d Cox said.\n\nFactory Output\n\nFactory staff are starting to push back. In June, Neckarsulm worker representatives estimated the site\u2019s utilization rate at a woeful 60%, despite model revamps for A6, A7 and A8 sedans. The factory, which employs almost 17,000, is missing out on the SUV sales boom and lacks firm commitments to assemble upcoming electric models, the powerful works council said, vowing to not budge on concessions as Audi seeks talks to cut costs.\n\nSince 2009, sales of A6 sedans and hatchbacks have sagged to make up 12% of the total, down from 20%, while the A4 made at the Ingolstadt headquarters has declined to 18% from 31%.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need plan to improve capacity utilization now and a medium-term solution for the future,\u201d Neckarsulm labor head Juergen Mews said in a statement.\n\nAudi said its German sites remained the backbone of its global production network. In Ingolstadt, which already makes the Q2 compact SUV alongside sedans, the brand is in the midst of construction work to make the plant more flexible, a spokeswoman said. Talks with the labor council on future allocation plans are ongoing, she said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Germany\u2019s car industry built its world-class reputation on sedans like the Audi A4, the BMW 5-Series and the Volkswagen Passat, reliable models that look good in the family driveway or company lot.
