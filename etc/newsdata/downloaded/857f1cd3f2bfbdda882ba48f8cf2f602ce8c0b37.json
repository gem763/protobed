Enjoy being reported to Virgin,' before sharing images of the exchange on Twitter.\n\nBut after talking about her experiences she says she has been 'bombarded with abusive messages', including one who told her to kill herself.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nJessica Van Meir, from Atlanta, Georgia, was called a 'tidy babe' and sent messages from a passenger with the username 'big d*** swinger' on a Virgin Atlantic plane's in-flight messaging service\n\nOne passenger nine rows away on the flight told Miss Van Meir she was a 'tidy babe'\n\nMiss Van Meir replied that she works for a law firm that specializes in online sexual harassment\n\nShe told the Victoria Derbyshire programme today: 'I'm grateful the reaction has been overwhelming of support.\n\n'But unfortunately any time a woman speaks out about being sexually harassed online she will get bombarded with abusive messages.'\n\nShe spoke of one 'particularly concerning' sent to her personal Facebook account.\n\nMiss Van Meir continued: 'A guy called me a w***e, he told me to go slit my wrists, he told me to suck his private parts.\n\n'It's really upsetting that there are so men that are so enraged about a woman sharing her experiences that they would go to the measure of looking me up and telling me to kill myself.'\n\nJessica Van Meir now works for a firm in Maidenhead, Berkshire\n\nShe added that it 'goes to show how sexism remains prevalent to this day to women on a daily basis.'\n\nTweeting about her ordeal, Miss Van Meir - who is now based in the UK and works for legal firm McAllister Olivarius in Maidenhead, Berkshire - said: 'I was on a Virgin Atlantic flight, and I unexpectedly received these sexually harassing messages on my screen.\n\n'I was in 55C. The flight attendants were helpful and dealt with it swiftly. Have any other women had this happen to them?'\n\nShe added: 'Virgin Atlantic, you should probably take measures to prevent this from happening by flagging specific language and putting in place a reporting function on the chat to report abusive users.'\n\nVirgin's 'seat to seat' chat system allows passengers to communicate on board, often while playing games on the screen in front of them.\n\nIt can also be used to order drinks, a snack or an in-flight meal and staff then know where to deliver it.\n\nBut there are calls for the system to be changed to avoid it being hijacked by people sending unsolicited messages, and Virgin says it will now be reviewing the system.\n\nA Virgin spokesman told MailOnline: 'We were extremely concerned to hear of the incident reported on-board one of our flights and are investigating as a matter of urgency.\n\n'We want all of our customers to have the best possible experience when they fly with us, and have zero tolerance for any disruptive or inappropriate behaviour.\n\n'We're grateful to our cabin crew who supported our customer following this incident and would like to apologise for the distress caused. We are now reviewing our entertainment systems to ensure this does not happen again'.", "description": "Jessica Van Meir, from Atlanta, Georgia, was called a 'tidy babe' and sent messages from a passenger with the username 'big d*** swinger' on the plane's in-flight messaging service.", "authors": ["Lara Keay", "Martin Robinson Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19537024-0-image-a-60_1570709401385.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
