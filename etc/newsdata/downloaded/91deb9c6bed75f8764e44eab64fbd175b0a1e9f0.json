And then the \u201caction\u201d becomes people talking through their problems, rather than doing something exciting.\n\nThis week\u2019s The Good Place, miraculously, executes a \u201ctrust\u201d story line that works, for two reasons. First, the show doesn\u2019t linger on the trust issue interminably. It\u2019s introduced at the start of the episode and is then (mostly) resolved by the end. More importantly, this particular complication isn\u2019t about someone struggling with a bruised ego. This is actually a matter of life and death \u2026 or, more accurately, afterlife and eternal torture.\n\nThe aptly named \u201cTinker, Tailor, Demon, Spy\u201d doesn\u2019t waste a lot of time getting to the point. The hooded figure we saw trucking toward the Neighborhood last week arrives almost immediately, and turns out to be the bespectacled, meek-natured demon Glenn. He immediately announces why he\u2019s there: to warn the humans that their \u201cMichael\u201d is actually Vicki in a Michael suit. Eleanor doesn\u2019t want to believe Glenn, except \u2026 This big reveal forces Michael to admit that he\u2019d already been told about the existence of Vicki\u2019s Michael suit. Worse, he has to confess that he lied to Eleanor about his emotional breakdown, which was not actually a clever parental trick to get her to take charge. (Michael knows this was a lie, but describes it as \u201can inspirational one,\u201d like \u201call of Instagram.\u201d)\n\nThe lies and half-truths are troubling, not because of what they say about Michael\u2019s relationship with the humans, but because they make dumb ol\u2019 Glenn\u2019s stupid accusation seem annoyingly credible. Unable to call Gen the Judge for a ruling \u2014 for fear she\u2019ll just restart the whole experiment \u2014 the gang gathers to puzzle out who\u2019s really telling the truth, leaving Glenn tied up in Mindy St. Claire\u2019s living room, thirsting for a hot glass of pig urine. (Asked by Eleanor what mixer would go well with urine, Jason doesn\u2019t miss a beat before saying, \u201cCoconut rum.\u201d)\n\nIs Glenn on the up-and-up? He does seem genuinely concerned that the Bad Place is overstepping its mission, and is now torturing humans who don\u2019t deserve it. Also, he has plausible inside info suggesting that the deployment of buff Chris as an undercover operative was all a diversion, meant to kidnap the real Michael and sneak Vicki into the Neighborhood. And he correctly declares that Shawn is just a big bully, who yells at everyone all the time. Jason can sympathize with that, because on Earth people yelled a lot at him, too, shouting things like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t pay for that!\u201d and \u201cHow do you plead!\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s flatlining! Clear!\u201d\n\nAs for Michael, he could answer his friends\u2019 questions in a second if he would just take off his own skin-suit and reveal the demon-self within. But he\u2019s too ashamed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of weird hogs in my life dude, get over yourself,\u201d Eleanor says, to which Michael replies \u2014 quite movingly \u2014 that he\u2019s worried the humans would never look at him the same way if they see him in his \u201cfire squid\u201d form. He\u2019s actually 6,000 feet tall, with flaming tentacles and teeth everywhere. His neck is long and, \u201cthere\u2019s a smell \u2026 And lots of juice\u2026 There\u2019s so much juice.\u201d\n\nAs the tension mounts in this episode, Janet whips up a kind of demon lie-detector wand, but the first time she uses it, Glenn explodes. While they scoop up Glenn\u2019s goo (and glasses) so he can begin the process of reforming and becoming a demon again, Michael offers to blow himself up as well, so that, \u201cI\u2019m out of your hair for good \u2026 Well, parts of me will be in your actual hair.\u201d\n\nAgain, all of this is both funny and legitimately nerve-racking. The payoff is terrific, too, when Jason \u2014 yes, Jason, the guy who can be distracted by a caramel \u2014 figures out the Bad Place didn\u2019t switch Michael with Vicki; they switched Janet with Bad Janet. When he calls Janet \u201cgirl\u201d and she doesn\u2019t respond \u201cnot a girl,\u201d he knows something\u2019s amiss. By the end of the episode, he and Michael are on their way back to the Bad Place to go rescue the real Janet and to punch a bully in the mouth.\n\nThe thing is, though, The Good Place hasn\u2019t entirely buried the trust question when it comes to Michael. For Eleanor & Co., from now on they won\u2019t just be wondering, Is Michael lying to us again? but also, Has the demon we love been replaced by another demon? That\u2019s a real wrinkle, not so easily ironed out with an apology or a long conversation. In other words: That\u2019s good TV storytelling.\n\nIn the Neighborhood\n\n\u2022 Not a lot of business for the new humans this week, aside from an episode-opening game of \u201cMagic Pictionary,\u201d wherein two teams \u2014 wearing T-shirts reading \u201cJohn & Tahani & Jianyu\u201d and \u201cChidi & Brent & Simone\u201d \u2014 draw items meaningful to each other\u2019s lives on Earth, which then come to life. John is treated to a living version of Mariah Carey\u2019s lower-back butterfly tattoo. (\u201cI wrote my college thesis on that back tattoo,\u201d he boasts.) And Simone \u2026 well, Chidi tries to draw her childhood pony Daisy, and instead conjures up a misshapen blob too monstrous for this world. (Bad Janet later describes how it was killed: \u201cI had to twist her head off. She did thrash. There was thrashing.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Brent maximizes his obnoxiousness in his brief time onscreen, mainly by calling Chidi \u201cChippy\u201d and encouraging him during \u201cMagic Pictionary\u201d to \u201cjust start drawing, my brotha!\u201d The terribleness of this gradually washes over Simone, who just keeps saying, \u201cOh, no. No, no, no, no \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jason exposes Bad Janet with the help of Mindy and Derek\u2019s magnetic handcuffs, from their wall of inexplicable sex toys. This stupefyingly weird collection sets up one of the episode\u2019s funniest lines, when a repulsed Michael groans, \u201cI just touched the danged diaper!\u201d\n\n\u2022 The different stages of demon growth, per Michael: larva, slug monster, spooky little girl, teenage boy, giant ball of tongues, social media CEO, demon.", "description": "The Bad Place demons are meddling again \u2014 but which ones?
