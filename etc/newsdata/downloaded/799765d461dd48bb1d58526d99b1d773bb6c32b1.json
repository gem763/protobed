No-one seemed to care about his case,\" he recalls of the lack of investigation.\n\nRisky business\n\nTel\u00e9sforo Ramirez's case is by no means unique, as most murders of police officers in Mexico go unpunished.\n\nAnd the number of officers killed is on the rise, according to Causa en Com\u00fan, an NGO working to highlight the precarious conditions in which police forces operate in Mexico.\n\nIn the first half of this year, 235 municipal, state and federal police were killed, two more than in the same period in 2018.\n\nAFP Killings of police officers 421 killed in Mexico in 2018\n\n55killed in the US in 2018 50,000number of officers Mexico wants to recruit by 2022 Sources: Causa en Com\u00fan/FBI\n\n\"It's easy to kill a police officer in Mexico,\" Causa en Com\u00fan's president, Mar\u00eda Elena Morera, told the BBC.\n\nImage caption Mar\u00eda Elena Morera says that the lives of police officers do not seem to matter in Mexico\n\n\"In the United States, when a police officer is killed, there is an uproar within society. Here, there is disinterest in the lives of the police. It seems that nobody cares,\" Ms Morera says.\n\nRisky profession\n\nThe rise in police officers killed and the low regard in which law enforcement is held in Mexico are two of the factors making it extremely hard for the government to fulfil its promise to recruit 50,000 people to fill the ranks of the newly created National Guard by 2022.\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador announced his plans to launch the new civilian force days before taking office in December 2018. He said the National Guard would be key in driving down record-breaking levels of crime and violence.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 58,000 officers from other security forces have been transferred to the National Guard to make up for the shortfall in civilian recruits\n\nFrom January to July 2019, more than 20,000 murders were reported, a 4% rise compared to the same period last year, which had been the most violent since records began.\n\nMs Morera says that President L\u00f3pez Obrador has set his goal too high. \"What people inside the National Guard have told us is that they're not reaching the recruitment numbers that the president believed would be easy to reach.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nMexican security expert Alejandro Hope says the government is not offering enough incentives to prospective candidates.\n\n\"If it's a risky profession, you have to pay a fair salary, and the salaries being offered are not enough,\" says the former head of the Centre for Research and National Security (Cisen), a government intelligence agency.\n\nThe average monthly salary in Mexico for entry-level officers ranges between $600 (\u00a3500) and $760 (\u00a3630). According to Officer Ramos, that is not enough to cover the basic needs of an officer's family.\n\nAs well as only receiving meagre salaries, officers in municipal and state police forces often have to pay for their own equipment. Causa en Com\u00fan found that nearly half reported having to pay for their uniforms and boots.\n\n'More of the same'\n\nOne of those who says he would never consider joining the National Guard is Marco Villafa\u00f1a. The 33-year-old former state police officer says the new force is just \"more of the same\".\n\nImage caption Marco Villafa\u00f1a says he was asked to extort businesses for protection money\n\nMr Villafa\u00f1a worked as a policeman in Guanajuato, a city in central Mexico where officers are being killed in record numbers. Twenty-four were murdered from January to 21 August this year alone.\n\n\"I joined because I wanted to serve, but very soon you realise that there is corruption everywhere.\"\n\nAfter more than a decade in the force, Mr Villafa\u00f1a became disenchanted with policing and started championing the rights of officers.\n\nHis contract was recently terminated by the police, a measure he says was taken in retaliation for him demanding better working conditions and which he is fighting in court.\n\nScandals and suspensions\n\nMr Villafa\u00f1a is not alone in thinking the force he worked for was crooked.\n\nFifty-four percent of law enforcement agents said they believed their agencies were corrupt, according to a 2018 survey carried out by Causa en Com\u00fan.\n\nIt is also an experience Officer Ramos says he had in Mexico City. \"Every [state] government arrives and makes a deal with a given crime group,\" he alleges.\n\nHe says he was denied promotions because he refused to cooperate with bosses who asked him to extort business owners in exchange for special protection.\n\nIt is an allegation that is backed up by the recent arrests in Mexico City of several police chiefs suspected of protecting local drug gangs.\n\nDistrust of law enforcement is widespread in the capital. Recently hundreds of protesters took to the streets following allegations that a group of police officers had raped a teenager.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The protest against police turned violent\n\nSix policemen have been suspended over the allegation.\n\nSantiago Nieto, a senior official in the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration, says that they are working hard to crack down on graft within the security forces across Mexico.\n\nImage caption Prisciliano Flores was a police officer in Mexico City for 25 years\n\nBut for Prisciliano Flores those changes come too late.\n\nThe 54 year old who spent 25 years as a police officer in Mexico City has quit his job after he became disillusioned with the force.\n\nHe says for him it was the lack of basic benefits, such as good quality healthcare, which finally tipped the balance.\n\n\"You get to a moment when you say, 'Is it worth it?', because you're not being treated fairly, even when you're delivering results,\" he says.", "description": "Creating a new police force was one of the president's top campaign pledges but will people join it?", "authors": ["Marcos Martinez", "Bbc Monitoring", "Mexico City"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FDAA/production/_108583946_ismaelramos2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
