You can read the rest of the articles in this series here.\n\nEver since Netflix came along, TV stations have become pretty much pointless, right? I mean why go through the excruciating process of waiting a week for a new episode of your favorite show when you can simply stream the entire season in one day? While that\u2019s a solid argument, it still comes with an awful problem: choice.\n\nNow, you might think that \u201cchoice\u201d isn\u2019t much of a problem at all \u2014 but you\u2019re wrong. With the choice that streaming services bring, comes the loss of not having to make a choice. Deep, right?\n\nLet me explain\n\nFirst up, I\u2019m a rather extreme case because, growing up in Iceland, I only had one TV channel for most of my life, but my situation is still applicable and you should take my opinion as fact.\n\nI\u2019ll paint you a word-picture of an eerily familiar scenario. You come home after a long tiring day at work, kick off your shoes, wolf down dinner, and then firmly plant yourself in front of the screen, hoping to transcend the mundanities of daily life and be spirited into a new world.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not currently knee-deep in binging a series, choosing the next show to watch is a pain. You see the thumbnails of series your friends have said YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST WATCH, but right now you\u2019re not really in the mood to be challenged intellectually \u2014 it was a tough day. So you decide to definitely watch it sometime soon, and then end up rewatching The Office for the gazillionth time.\n\nToo many options mean tough decisions, which means returning once again to the familiar and safe bosom of a long-worn out show. No adventure or new discovery. No ticking a movie off your bucket list.\n\nAnd this is a problem shared by many, judging by how many people read our guide on how to find something to watch on Netflix. There\u2019s also a TED talk on how more choice can actually not happier but more dissatisfied, so I have double proof and you have to believe me.\n\nThis talk is actually from 2005, before Netflix become the hottest streaming service in the world, but I\u2019m gonna forcibly apply it to Netflix to make my case. Psychologist Barry Schwartz\u2019s argument basically boils down to this: when faced with too many options, it actually produces paralysis, and even if we overcome it, we\u2019ll be less satisfied with our choice.\n\nUnlike watching linear TV, streaming always puts you in the driver\u2019s seat, forcing you to deal with the existential dread of making the right choice or feeling like a failure for having wasted an evening on The Holiday Calendar. With linear TV you might waste an evening, but it isn\u2019t really your fault \u2014 or at least it\u2019s easier to lie to yourself that it isn\u2019t.\n\nLinear TV\u2019s greatest strength: Discovery\n\nThere\u2019s so many films and documentaries I\u2019ve enjoyed that I would never have consciously \u2018put on\u2019 Netflix, as it would\u2019ve felt like too much of an investment. Will I really have the time and attention to sit through a two-hour documentary about the history of Italian bidets? Only the gods know. But finding it already playing when I turn on the TV is just the nudge I need. And while this isn\u2019t necessarily the best content out there \u2014 the documentary on French bidets was far better \u2014 it does broaden my horizons.\n\nThen there\u2019s also all the types of shows and segments that streaming just hasn\u2019t been able to master as of yet. Daily and deep-dive news programs, talk shows on topics such as literature, arts, niche subcultures, and shows depicting local issues and interesting tidbits. Linear TV still has these in the bag.\n\nI\u2019m also a relatively smart person (my mom says so), which I owe in part to all the \u2018knowledge\u2019 I\u2019ve randomly gleaned from TV, especially when I was a kid. Every day I\u2019d plant myself in front of the ol\u2019 picture box and absorbed the world\u2019s collective knowledge like a sponge.\n\nBut a lot of channels suck, right?\n\nTV stations are of course incredibly diverse and different between countries and regions \u2014 basically, there\u2019s a lot of crap out there (looking at you, US). There\u2019s also an incredible amount to choose from, so mindlessly flipping through channels until I hit a rerun of The Office means I\u2019m in the same predicament as I am with streaming. There\u2019s also annoying ads, but that\u2019s capitalism baby. I still maintain the linear TV viewing experience is much purer.\n\nThere\u2019s something so beautiful about tapping into a stream of content enjoyed simultaneously by masses of people around the country, whether it\u2019s a quality program or a disruptive ad. There\u2019s a sense of camaraderie and companionship, as you give up a certain amount of control to join them. Instead of being a lonely, cooped-up, omnipotent streaming god, where the time of day has no meaning and all of the world\u2019s creation is at your fingertips, you decide to acknowledge the world around you, your place in it, and all its limitations.\n\nYou might not get exactly what you wanted, but who says you knew what that was anyway? You open yourself up to discovery and new ideas as you plug yourself into a beam of emotions and a sense of time that you share with the rest of society. Basically, it keeps you anchored in the stormy seas of technological progress and societal disunity (damn I\u2019m a good writer).\n\nArtist\u2019s rendition of me trying to watch a Norwegian documentary on gravel.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to shit anyway\n\nWe can\u2019t stop technological progress and backtrack to how things were \u2014 it\u2019s simply impossible. All I\u2019m asking is for streaming and linear TV to coexist, which might actually happen with new Netflix rivals.\n\nOne of the biggest attractions of streaming was that you\u2019ve got all your content in one place. Just open up Netflix and binge away. But the times are a-changin\u2019. I\u2019ve personally now got both Netflix and Amazon Prime, and there\u2019s loads more coming.\n\nThe introduction of Disney+ will definitely make a huge dent in the current selection of streaming services and make the streaming industry even more fragmented. And Disney+ is also going to be releasing original shows weekly, with Apple TV+ considering the same approach. So streaming is basically becoming like TV channels, just without the types of shows and sense of community that linear TV can provide.\n\nSo instead of hopping fully on to the fragmented, over-glorified streaming wagon, I dare to hope for a future where TV becomes a free and societally beneficial amalgamation of streaming and linear programming. An amplifying platform of human connectedness and a driver for world peace!
