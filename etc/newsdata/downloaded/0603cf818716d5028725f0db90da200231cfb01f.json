(CCL) lowered its earnings outlook for the year, citing voyage disruptions due to Hurricane Dorian and tensions in the Arabian Gulf between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nThe world's biggest cruise operator cut its fiscal year adjusted earnings forecast to $4.23 to $4.27 a share from its previous guidance of $4.25 to $4.35. The company said changes in fuel prices and currency exchange rates are expected to decrease earnings compared with its June guidance.\n\nShares of Carnival fell more than 8% to $43.92.\n\nCarnival had lowered its outlook in June, citing the abrupt Cuba travel ban and weakening demand in Europe.\n\nFor its current quarter, Carnival said weather disruptions, a ship delivery delay and the travel ban to Cuba are expected to have a financial impact of about 7 to 9 cents a share. The company said it expects adjusted per-share earnings of 46 cents to 50 cents for its fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected 64 cents a share on an adjusted basis.\n\nFor its 2020 fiscal year, the company said it expects capacity to grow about 7% and said that fuel expenses are expected to be $1.8 billion, compared with the $1.6 billion it projects for 2019.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
