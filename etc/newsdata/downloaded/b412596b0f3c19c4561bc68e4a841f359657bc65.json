Biden Jr.\n\nHis personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has undertaken a nearly yearlong, free-ranging effort to unearth information helpful to Mr. Trump and harmful to Mr. Biden.", "description": "Since the 2016 campaign, the president has had an intense fixation on the country, which he believes is tied up in the origins of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
