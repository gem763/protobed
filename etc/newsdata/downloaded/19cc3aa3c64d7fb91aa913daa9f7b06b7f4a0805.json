Between 8am and 9am.\n\nWhat's the first thing you do there? I review my schedule for the day with my assistant, Suzy. No two days are the same! My day could involve meetings with my design team to review concepts, sketches or first round prototypes, meetings with the creative team, or the PR team to discuss upcoming events. As creative director, I oversee every area of the business so I meet with almost every team in our office. It\u2019s very exciting to touch all areas of the Kate Spade world.\n\nNicola Glass acknowledge applause after unveiling her Kate Spade collection during New York Fashion Week in 2018. AP\n\nLunch break or power through? Power through. I always have meetings through lunch so I normally eat a salad during them.\n\nAny workday non-negotiables? A Moleskine notebook and a Pentel P205 0.5mm drafting pencil.\n\nWhat's your favourite handbag? The Nicola \u2013 it was the first style I designed for the brand, and I love the new colours and details we\u2019ve been incorporating each season. It\u2019s a softly structured shoulder bag with feminine details that balance the strong, graphic silhouette.\n\nWhat piece of technology could you not live without and why? My iPhone. I love to listen to music and I'm also constantly taking pictures on my phone which could inspire ideas for future collections. I got the idea for the Geobrella print used in our summer collection from the graphic beach umbrellas I saw while on holiday in Cinque Terre, on the Italian Coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat app do you open the most and why? Instagram \u2013 I love following our hashtag #loveinspades to see how customers are wearing pieces and how they interact with the brand.\n\nMoleskine notebook, drafting pencil, Earl Grey tea \u2026 just a few of Nicola Glass' favourite things. Daniel Gray-Barnett/The Jacky Winter Group\n\nIt's your birthday. How are you celebrating and who with? My husband and my son, Flynn, and my twin sister, Tara. She lives in London, so I love when we can spend our birthday together.\n\nIt's 5pm. What are you drinking? Usually another cup of tea to give me a little boost to finish the work day.\n\nOK \u2013 it's 8pm: what are you drinking now? On a week night, I might have a glass of wine with dinner. If I\u2019m on vacation, a margarita.\n\nEveryone has a guilty pleasure: what's yours? Dark chocolate with sea salt.\n\nLast binge-watch? HBO psychological thriller Sharp Objects.\n\nLast book you read? This great memoir by Ariel Levy called The Rules Do Not Apply. It\u2019s so engrossing, I almost finished the book on one flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat book did you tell everyone you read, but secretly may have skimmed? Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. It\u2019s fascinating but I\u2019m still only halfway through \u2026\n\nEveryone's doing karaoke, including you. What's your song? Bette Davis Eyes by Kim Carnes.\n\nIf you could choose it, your last meal on this earth would be \u2026 My husband's fish en papillote. He marinates the fish with olive oil, white wine, lemons, capers and spices and cooks it in parchment paper on the grill. Plus French fries \u2013 I love potatoes.\n\nIf you had an entirely free day, with no prior commitments, what would you do? I'd escape to the countryside. Being in nature and by the ocean is how I balance living in New York City. Whenever we can, we escape to our house near Montauk on Long Island. I\u2019d start the day with a sporting activity \u2013 paddle boarding or hiking \u2013 followed by a long leisurely lunch and then end with a cocktail with friends around our outdoor fire pit.\n\nGlass likes to escape to Montauk on Long Island, a day trip away from New York. Kylie McLaughlin\n\nIf you could, which chore would you give up forever? All of them \u2026 Although I do find sweeping the floor therapeutic.\n\nWhat's the nicest present you've ever received? My engagement ring. My husband totally surprised me and designed it with a friend using a beautiful antique diamond.\n\nFavourite city? New York. I always wanted to live here and I find it such a vibrant, inspiring city.\n\nBest travel tip? Pack your shoes first and then figure out what you can do without. That is the key to packing light.\n\nLuxury is \u2026 a combination of innovation and indulgence resulting in relevant and enduring pieces.
