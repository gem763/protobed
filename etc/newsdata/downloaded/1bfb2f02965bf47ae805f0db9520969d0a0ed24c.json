First, there is the video of him picking up trash from a Chennai beach, which has divided the internet\u2019s opinion. Then there are the headlines about Damyanti Ben.\n\nIt was on Saturday morning that Damyanti Ben reached Delhi from Amritsar. Soon after, two men snatched her bag from her and fled on a motorbike. This episode would have been forgotten, but two days later Damyanti Ben\u2019s name is still in the headlines. The reason? She is PM Narendra Modi\u2019s niece.\n\nThe incident took place outside Gujarati Samaj Bhawan in Civil Lines area. The handbag that was wrenched from Damyanti Ben's hand when she was alighting from an auto-rickshaw, reportedly contained Rs 56,000, 2 mobile phones, some documents, and other valuables.\n\nDamyanti, the daughter of the prime minister's brother Prahlad Modi, has praised Delhi Police for their prompt response. The cops nabbed the two robbers within a day after examining CCTV footage.\n\nThe Modi connection\n\nThe swift way in which Delhi Police dealt with the incident, resulted in many complaining of \u201cVIP Raj\u201d. But a spokesperson has maintained that Modi's niece did not reveal her connection to the PM while filing the complaint.\n\n\"While filing the complaint, the complainant did not reveal that she belonged to a VIP family. She came to us as a normal complainant. We registered the case and initiated the probe,\" DCP, North, Monika Bhardwaj said.\n\nAccording to reports, 700 personnel were deployed to find the culprits and Delhi police checked the footage of over 200 CCTV cameras to nab the thieves, who turned out to be two 20-somethings from Delhi.\n\nThe political blame game\n\nThe incident has thrown into stark relief the state of law and order in the capital city and the challenges faced by the city\u2019s women everyday as they negotiate it\u2019s public spaces. But the conversation has quickly been derailed by political whataboutery.\n\nBJP member Manoj Tiwari was quick to blame \u201coutsiders\u201d for the crime and blamed Delhi CM Arjind Kejriwal of shielding them. Then there was the question about who has jurisdiction over Delhi Police, the Union or the state?\n\nWhile the blame game continues, many people took to social media to ask Delhi Police \u201cMera number kab aayega?\u201d and when will they finally get an update about their stolen belongings. Suffice to say, the response has been radio silence.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Damyanti Ben\u2019s bag was snatched by two robbers on Saturday in Delhi, and the incident has dominated the headlines for two days now.
