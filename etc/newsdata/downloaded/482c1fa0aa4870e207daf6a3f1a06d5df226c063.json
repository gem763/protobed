The movement is supported by continued economic growth and investor expectations that supportive central-bank policy will sustain the current expansion, analysts said.\n\nThe decline in Treasury bond yields, which fall when bond prices rise, is important because the yields are a key reference rate that lenders use to set interest rates on other debt, such as consumer mortgages and corporate bonds. Lower bond yields and central-bank interest rates typically stimulate economic growth and support stock prices.\n\nMr. Gross, however, expects slowing growth. He said further efforts by central banks to ease monetary policy probably won't push stocks higher because of the harmful effects of negative interest-rate policies.\n\nThose policies \"literally rob small savers and larger financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies and pension funds of their ability to earn\" interest on the bonds they purchase in order to match assets and liabilities, Mr. Gross said.\n\nMr. Gross recommended that investors own \"high yielding, secure-dividend stocks.\"\n\nU.S. government-bond prices declined Tuesday after reports that negotiators for the U.K. and European Union were making progress toward a preliminary Brexit agreement. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose for a fourth consecutive session, its longest such streak in a month, settling at 1.773%, compared with 1.748% Friday. The yield ended last year at 2.684%.\n\nFederal-funds futures, which investors use to bet on the path of the central bank's interest-rate policy, show a 75% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting at the end of this month, compared with an 83% probability a week ago, according to CME Group data.\n\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 17:29 ET (21:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
