Mr Erdogan said on Friday it would run for some 440 km from west to east along the border, though the US special envoy for Syria said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting.\n\nMr Erdogan also said on Friday Turkey would set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria, and that he would hold talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin on what steps to take in the planned \u201csafe zone\u201d next week.\n\nReuters", "description": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey will \u201ccrush the heads\u201d of Kurdish fighters if they do not withdraw from parts of northeast Syria.
