REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah/File Photo\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has named Yasir al-Rumayyan, head of the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, known as the PIF, as chairman of Aramco, replacing Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, as the state oil giant prepares to go public.\n\nBloomberg reported the news first on Monday, citing an unnamed Saudi official.\n\nFalih later congratulated Rumayyan on the appointment on his official twitter feed, saying that it was \u201can important step to prepare the company for the public offering.\u201d\n\nAramco, the world\u2019s top oil producing company, is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of up to 5% by 2020-2021. Selling a stake in Aramco has been a centrepiece of Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nRumayyan, a former investment banker, was appointed managing director of the Public Investment Fund in September 2015, after a serving as advisor at the royal court for a brief period before that. He joined Saudi Aramco\u2019s board in 2016.\n\nThe move comes a few days after Saudi Arabia created a new ministry for industry and mineral resources, separating it from the kingdom\u2019s colossal energy ministry, in a series of royal orders issued late on Friday.\n\nThe separation appears to diminish the sprawling authority of Falih, who retained control of the energy portfolio.\n\nFalih had overseen more than half the Saudi economy through the super-ministry, which was created in 2016 to help streamline new reforms. But despite ambitious plans for industry and mining, the sectors have seen relatively little development.", "description": "Saudi Arabia has named Yasir al-Rumayyan, head of the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, known as the PIF, as chairman of Aramco, replacing Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, as the state oil giant prepares to go public.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425429879&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8117Z"}
