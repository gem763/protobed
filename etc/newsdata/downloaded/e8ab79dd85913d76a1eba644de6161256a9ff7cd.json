Hoskins more than paid him back.\n\nThe Philadelphia first baseman drove in three runs with two homers and Bryce Harper and Scott Kingery added two-run shots as the Phillies overpowered the Cincinnati Reds 7-1 on Monday.\n\nAquino maintained his dizzying home run pace, leading off the second with a drive to left field off Drew Smyly that reached the upper deck for his 15th homer of the season. He needed just 122 plate appearances to collect them, 13 fewer than the record of 135 set by Hoskins in 2017.\n\nHoskins responded in the third with his 26th homer, a two-out, two-run blast into the Reds\u2018 bullpen. He briefly celebrated by raising his right fist for a few steps between first and second base.\n\n\u201cHe got on first base late in the game, and I told him: \u2018Keep going. This is something you\u2019ll remember for the rest of your life,\u2019\u201d Hoskins said of Aquino. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive to watch. He\u2019s a big kid. He got up on me, and I was taken aback.\u201d\n\nHoskins in 2017 became the quickest player ever to 11 home runs, reaching the mark in 18 games. Aquino went deep 11 times in 17 games.\n\nHarper extended his hitting and scoring streaks to 10 games with a liner into the right-field seats in the eighth inning off Wandy Peralta. Hoskins followed two pitches later with his second homer of the game.\n\n\u201cHe looks really relaxed and confident,\u201d Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said of Hoskins, who was ejected from Saturday night\u2019s game against the Mets for arguing balls and strikes. \u201cObviously, he wants the calls to go in his direction. We\u2019ve seen that the past few days, but he\u2019s not letting it beat him down.\u201d\n\nAfter beating the Mets 5-2 on Sunday night, the Phillies have two straight wins for the first time since Aug. 20-21 at Boston. They remain 2 1/2 games behind the Cubs for the second NL wild card after Chicago beat Seattle on Monday.\n\nRelying on his curveball, Smyly (3-6) tied his season high with eight strikeouts while earning his first win in six starts since beating San Francisco on July 30. He gave up four hits, one run and three walks in 5 1/3 innings.\n\n\u201cThat was the key to my success,\u201d the left-hander said. \u201cI was throwing it early for strikes and getting strike one on the hitters. I feel like getting strike one puts me in a whole other picture.\u201d\n\nCincinnati\u2019s Anthony DeSclafani (9-8) shook off a rough start to last seven innings, giving up three hits and four runs with two walks and eight strikeouts.\n\nThe Phillies never trailed after Kingery\u2019s shot over the center-field fence in the second, his 16th homer of the season.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that I have to cut down on home runs, but I got ahead of a lot of hitters today,\u201d said DeSclafani, who gave up multiple homers in a game for the seventh time this season. \u201cIt was two pitches. Basically the one to Kingery was elevated a little bit, but he had an off-balance swing that he got on the barrel of the bat and it barely got out. I guess you\u2019ve got to tip your cap.\u201d\n\nSO FAR, SO GOOD\n\nHoskins has five home runs and eight RBIs in five career games at Great American Ball Park.\n\nQUICK WORK\n\nKingery\u2019s homer gave him five RBIs in two at-bats over two games. His eighth-inning, three-run double snapped a 2-2 tie against the Mets on Sunday night.\n\nGOOD SPORTS\n\nThe scoreboard showed a message saying \u201cThank you, Jared Hughes,\u201d when the former Red took the mound in the sixth for his first appearance in Cincinnati since the Phillies claimed him off waivers on Aug. 15. \u201cI made a lot of friends in Cincinnati and formed relationships that I\u2019ll cherish for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat meant a lot to me.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPhillies: Joey Votto\u2019s sharp one-hopper glanced off Smyly\u2019s foot to third baseman Brad Miller, who threw Votto out in the first inning. Smyly didn\u2019t need a visit from trainer.\n\nReds: X-rays of 3B Eugenio Su\u00e1rez\u2019s left hand were negative. He has a bruise after being hit by a Daniel Ponce de Leon pitch in the fifth inning of Sunday night\u2019s 5-3 win in St. Louis.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: In his only career start against the Reds, on July 28, 2018, RHP Vince Velasquez (6-7) allowed six hits and five walks in five innings of a 6-2 loss in Cincinnati.\n\nReds: The Reds announced after the game that RHP Lucas Sims (2-1) would start Tuesday\u2019s game in place of LHP Alex Wood (1-3), who developed what were described as \u201cback issues.\u201d Wood missed most of the first four months of the season with lower back stiffness.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Aristides Aquino broke another one of Rhys Hoskins' records.
