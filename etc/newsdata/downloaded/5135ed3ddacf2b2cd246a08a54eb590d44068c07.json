I need help ASAP.\u2019\n\nElite police unit officers escort a 19-year old British woman, centre, with head covered, to Famagusta court in August (Picture: AP)\n\nA Snapchat message to her friend said: \u2018They\u2019ve honestly made me sign false statements\u2019, while another read: \u2018I don\u2019t even know I\u2019m actually scared being here.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe teenager said investigators, led by Detective Sergeant Marios Christou, told her that police had videos which showed she had consensual group sex.\n\n\u2018I asked to see the videos because I didn\u2019t know they existed,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018He said that wasn\u2019t possible, but he had studied them and it was very clear there was no rape.\u2019\n\n\u2018He threatened to arrest (my friend) and take her for conspiracy, and he said that, because of all these so-called videos, he was going to arrest me If I didn\u2019t say that I had lied and that I would not see my mum until I was in handcuffs in a court,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I was really scared because I didn\u2019t think I would leave that police station without signing that statement.\u2019\n\n\u2018I realised at this point the police were completely against me.\u2019\n\nThe British teenager accused seven Israelis of gang rape (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe woman spent four-and-a-half weeks in prison before she was granted bail at the end of August, but cannot leave the island, which is popular with British holidaymakers.\n\nShe could face up to a year in jail and a 1,700 euro (about \u00a31,500) fine if she is found guilty.\n\nThe teenager arrived with her mother at Famagusta District Court in Paralimni, dressed in black and wearing a baseball cap and a scarf to cover her face.\n\nProsecutor Adamos Demosthenous dropped a bid to play a video, in closed court, of her found on some of the mobile phones confiscated from members of the Israeli group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRitsa Pekri, defending, said it would be dangerous for her psychological health if she saw it.\n\nThe video, timed at 02.56am on July 17, is said to have shown the woman involved in sexual activity with one man as others tried to enter the room before being told to go away.\n\nThe teenager\u2019s family have set up a crowdfunding page asking for money for legal costs, which has raised more than \u00a336,000.\n\nIn an online post, they said: \u2018We live in hope that it will be resolved in this time. Thanks to all of you for making this possible.\u2019\n\nThe court heard that the woman eventually signed a retraction statement just before 2am, some eight hours after she was picked up from her hotel by police on July 27.\n\nGiving evidence, DS Christou denied pressuring her and said he began to suspect that she had lied about being raped after noticing inconsistencies between her first and second statements.\n\nHe said that, when he raised his suspicions and suggested possible reasons why she invented the allegation, she said: \u2018Because they were videoing me, I felt embarrassed and insulted.\u2019\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Michael Polak, director of the group Justice Abroad, which is assisting the teenager, said: \u2018The best evidence of what happened at the police station on July 27 is in the text messages from the night, which clearly show pressure was being placed on her on all different fronts.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial continues on Wednesday.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
