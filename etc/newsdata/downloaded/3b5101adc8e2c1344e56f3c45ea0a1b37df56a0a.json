Cory Booker (D-N.J.) made an impassioned call for stricter gun controls at a presidential candidate forum on Wednesday, specifically calling out former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) for only coming around to supporting national gun licensing after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.\n\n\u201cYou should not be a nominee from our party \u2026 if you don\u2019t believe in gun licensing,\u201d Booker said at the Las Vegas event, which was hosted by gun safety groups Giffords and March for Our Lives. It took place one day after the two-year anniversary of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, which claimed 58 lives.\n\nNine Democratic candidates were expected to speak at the 2020 Gun Safety Forum, including former Vice President Joe Biden, former Obama housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBooker pointed out that some of his fellow candidates don\u2019t support federal gun licensing while he was the first to make it part of his campaign platform. Warren, who spoke after Booker, released a gun reform plan in August that includes federal gun licensing. Biden\u2019s plan, released on Wednesday before the forum, doesn\u2019t go as far, instead calling for incentives for states to enact gun licensing programs.\n\n\u201cWhen I came out as the first person saying that, people told me it was too bold and too far,\u201d Booker said Wednesday of federal licensing. \u201cBut I\u2019m grateful now many have come out in support of my position.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke was not for gun licensing \u2015 criticized me when I came out for it,\u201d the New Jersey senator added. \u201cHe saw the horrors visiting his community. Are we going to have to wait until hell\u2019s lottery comes to your community? No, we are a better country.\u201d\n\nIn Las Vegas on Wednesday, O\u2019Rourke responded to Booker\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI want to give Senator Booker all the credit in the world for being a leader on this. This is not a moment to seek division,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThe fact that he has joined \u2015 really, I was gonna say \u2018our\u2019 \u2015 but March for Our Lives\u2019 leadership on a mandatory buyback on AR-15s and AK-47s, that\u2019s a really good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me ... it doesn\u2019t matter how soon you get to a given position, as long as you\u2019re in the right place,\u201d he added.\n\nMSNBC Sen. Cory Booker speaks at the 2020 Gun Safety Forum for Democratic presidential candidates in Las Vegas.\n\nIn September\u2019s Democratic primary debate, O\u2019Rourke made headlines calling for a mandatory buyback program for semi-automatic weapons, telling gun owners: \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15.\u201d\n\nRival candidates Booker and Harris have since expressed support for the idea. Buttigieg and Biden have said they think buybacks should be voluntary.\n\nOn Wednesday, Booker repeated that he supports such a program and suggested that questioning whether the U.S. should have a mandatory buyback of assault weapons is \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nThe senator released a sweeping plan to combat gun violence in May, calling for a national gun licensing program, bans on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, and an increase in federal funding for violence intervention programs.\n\nEnding gun violence is a major priority for Democratic primary voters, who widely support reforms like gun licensing and voluntary buybacks of assault weapons. More than 70% of American voters overall support requiring people to obtain a license before being able to purchase a gun, according to a late August HuffPost/YouGov poll.\n\nSome form of gun licensing, which currently requires a person to obtain a permit from local or state authorities before buying a weapon, is the law in 15 states.\n\nOn Wednesday, Booker pointed to the effects of Connecticut\u2019s 1995 gun licensing law. Research has shown that over the first 10 years of that law, the state\u2019s firearm homicide rate fell by 40% and its firearm suicide rate decreased by 15% from what they were otherwise predicted to be.\n\nBooker also noted how the epidemic of daily gun violence disproportionately impacts poor communities of color.\n\n\u201cNobody will go to the White House with more of a sense of urgency to end this scourge than me,\u201d he said.", "description": "The former Texas congressman came around to the New Jersey senator's idea after the El Paso mass shooting.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d94ff0f2200008c01dc674f.png?cache=05don8fuoj&ops=1778_1000"}
