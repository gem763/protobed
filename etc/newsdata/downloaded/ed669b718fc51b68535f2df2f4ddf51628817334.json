So BA will adapt, it has been adapting and it will adapt.\n\n\"I think it is impossible for anybody not to be affected somehow [by those conversations], because they [his teenage children] are growing up in a completely different environment than what we grew up in. So the conversations are frequent, the debate is frequent and I think that anybody who has teenagers or young people in the family will be having these sort of discussions. And certainly in my kitchen there are quite a few of those discussions taking place every week.\"\n\nBA's parent company, IAG, plans to invest $400m (\u00a3328m) on developing alternative sustainable fuels over the next two decades.\n\nThe airline is also the first in Europe to invest in building a plant that converts organic household waste into jet fuel.\n\nEarlier this summer a team at University College London won a BA-sponsored sustainable fuel competition which researchers hope will, by the middle of this century, enable 3.5million tonnes of jet fuel to be produced annually using converted household waste at plants attached to landfill sites around the UK.", "description": "British Airways and its competitor airlines\u00a0\"have to be thinking about flying in different ways\" to\u00a0reduce their environmental impact,\u00a0its chief executive\u00a0has said.\u00a0 Alex Cruz said airlines cannot operate exactly as they have done \"over the last 100 years\" and must adapt by changing how they fly, including the services they offer and the seating density of their planes.", "authors": ["Tom Batchelor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/03/20/britishairways-216861028913248.jpg"}
