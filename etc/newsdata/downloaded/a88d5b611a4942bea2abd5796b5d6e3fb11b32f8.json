It also warned the increase in its capital ratio in 2019 would be below its 170-200 basis points per annum guidance.\n\nThe lender made a PPI provision in its second quarter of \u00a3650 million.\n\nLloyds had been expected to make a further provision following its rivals' moves, with analysts at KBW saying they had downgraded the bank last week partly due to the expected charge. KBW said the top end of the charge at \u00a31.8 billion was marginally better than its worse case scenario.\n\nLloyds was given some breathing space on capital in May, when regulators reduced its required core capital ratio to 12.5 per cent from 13 per cent, equating to around \u00a31 billion.\n\nLloyds is continuing to target paying a dividend and said it would make a decision on surplus capital at the end of the year.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [LONDON] Lloyds Banking Group will set aside up to an extra \u00a31.8 billion (S$3.05 billion) to settle mis-selling claims in Britain's costliest consumer banking scandal, and said it was suspending its 2019 share buyback programme. .
