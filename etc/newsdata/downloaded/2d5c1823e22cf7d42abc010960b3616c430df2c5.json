REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A mooted eleventh-hour solution to the Brexit deadlock cannot work because Northern Ireland must remain in a full United Kingdom customs union, the deputy leader of the province\u2019s key political party said on Saturday.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in Westminster, will play a key role in deciding whether Britain can agree a new withdrawal agreement with the European Union before the departure deadline of Oct. 31.\n\nAccording to EU diplomats, Johnson has proposed keeping Northern Ireland in a UK customs union and some form of EU customs partnership. This means the province would face customs and regulatory checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain.\n\nThat is designed to prevent the return of customs checks on the island of Ireland, at the border between the British province and EU-member Ireland.\n\nNegotiators for Britain and the EU have embarked on intense talks to see if they can make the proposal work, and while DUP leader Arlene Foster gave a guarded welcome to the plan on Friday, deputy leader Nigel Dodds sounded more downbeat.\n\nItalian newspaper Repubblica quoted him as saying that Johnson knew their position. \u201cNo, it cannot work,\u201d Dodds said, \u201cbecause Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union\u201d.\n\nDodds is the DUP\u2019s leader in the Westminster parliament and his views have proved influential with some members of Johnson\u2019s own party who want a cleaner break with Brussels. Opposition from the DUP led to parliament rejecting three times a previous Brexit deal agreed by Johnson predecessor Theresa May.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere is a lot of stuff coming from Brussels, pushed by the Europeans in the last hours, but one thing is sure: Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well.\u201d", "description": "A mooted eleventh-hour solution to the Brexit deadlock cannot work because Northern Ireland must remain in a full United Kingdom customs union, the deputy leader of the province's key political party said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440103525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0GZ", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
