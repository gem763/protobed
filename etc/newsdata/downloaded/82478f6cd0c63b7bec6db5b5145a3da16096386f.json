We made mistakes in the two areas which didn\u2019t allow us to close the game out and not concede goals,\u201d Pioli said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop talking about a \u2018young Milan\u2019 or \u2018old Milan.\u2019 We\u2019re Milan and we\u2019ve got to wear this shirt with honor and pride.\u201d\n\nHakan Calhanoglu had put Milan ahead early on before Khouma Babacar equalized with a penalty after the break. Calhanoglu also set up a goal for Krzysztof Piatek, who broke out of a scoring slump. Marco Calderoni scored the final goal for Lecce in stoppage time.\n\n\u201cWe should have closed the match earlier,\u201d Pioli said. \u201cWe deserved to win but we didn\u2019t get the three points due to our own faults. We weren\u2019t attentive on their second goal.\u201d\n\nThe draw, coming on Pioli\u2019s 54th birthday, left Milan in 12th place.\n\nJUVE\u2019S SLIM MARGINS\n\nSerie A leader Juventus also needs to be more clinical.\n\nThe eight-time defending champion required a spectacular save from Gianluigi Buffon to preserve a 2-1 win over Bologna on Saturday - marking the sixth time this season that Juventus has won by a one-goal margin.\n\n\u201cWe still need to improve,\u201d said left back Alex Sandro, who helped set up the opening goal by Cristiano Ronaldo. \u201cWe need to close out matches sooner. That\u2019s what we\u2019re still lacking.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stefano Pioli has his work cut out for him at struggling AC Milan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/italy_soccer_serie_a_07934_c0-119-2860-1787_s1200x700.jpg?d57ea1d16b917cbd2d13bc072d5ddc42e99d65b2", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
