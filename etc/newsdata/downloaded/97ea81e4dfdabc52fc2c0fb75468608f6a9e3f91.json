He has said he would pay for it by putting a European-style value-added tax on tech companies.\n\nYang is already personally funding a $1,000 a month freedom dividend for three families.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News earlier this year, Yang insisted that giving away money to voters is \u201c100 percent legal,\u201d saying he consulted lawyers and the Federal Election Commission first. He denied it amounts to buying votes.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is talk to any of the people that are actually receiving the freedom dividend and ask them has anyone from my campaign ever said that they need to do anything in return and you will categorically no: they can vote for whoever they like,\u201d Yang said in June.\n\nAhead of the debate, Yang teased the forthcoming debate stunt, tweeting earlier this week that \u201cwe've got something big in store.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to the debate, Yang also worked to portray himself as different from the other politicians running for president, posting a \u201cdebate prep\u201d video showing him boxing and playing basketball.
