We think that if a big business thinks that\u2019s absolutely necessary to protect their finances then they should be able to show that before they\u2019re able to do that.\"\n\nHe did, however, flag changes to another part of the bill which enables religious institutions to discriminate in accordance with their faith.\n\nUnder the draft bill, a school such as a Catholic school would be entitled to employ a teacher on the basis that he or she was Catholic, ahead of another candidate who was not. But it could not reject an applicant if that person was gay, for example.\n\nMr Porter said on Sunday he was likely to extend those discriminatory powers to other faith-based institutions.\n\n\"Whether or not that exception is extended out to accommodate for religious hospitals and religious aged care is the issue that we\u2019re grappling with now after the consultations but I think some refinement in that area is going to be necessary,'' he said.", "description": "In a fresh spray at corporate Australia for straying into social issues, Attorney-General Christian Porter said business had already \"gone too far'' in telling people how to live their lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2384%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_180/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bd655a02161b97dcc77e00f329652f3daf218832", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
