Wallace to the Fifth Circuit, Roberta Liebenberg, chair of the ABA\u2019s judicial-evaluations committee, commits multiple acts of apparent flat-out perjury in defending her committee\u2019s \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating of Wallace\u2014a rating that resulted from a scandalous process marked by bias, a glaring conflict of interest, incompetence, a stacked committee, the ABA\u2019s violation of its own procedures, and cheap gamesmanship. (See here for documentation.)\n\n2013\u2014A Second Circuit panel (consisting of one Clinton appointee, one Bush 43 appointee, and one Obama appointee) unanimously reverses senior federal district judge Jack B. Weinstein, who had ruled\u2014in a 349-page opinion (with an additional 50+ pages of appendices)\u2014that the Eighth Amendment bars applying the statutory minimum five-year term of imprisonment to a youthful defendant who pleaded guilty to one count of distributing child pornography. Unhappy over the reversal, Weinstein within hours issues an extraordinary memorandum arguing that the case \u201cexemplifies the sometimes unnecessary cruelty of our federal criminal law.\u201d\n\nWeinstein, alas, badly obscures the essential facts of the case. He contends in the brief \u201cFacts\u201d section of his memorandum that the defendant \u201cnever produced, sold or deliberately exchanged [child] pornography.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But according to the Second Circuit, the defendant admitted that\n\nhe had opened a GigaTribe account in November 2008 and used it and another file sharing program, LimeWire, to download \u201ca ton\u201d of child pornography onto the seized computers; and that he had shared child pornography files in designated folders with between 10 and 20 other GigaTribe users. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe Second Circuit\u2019s opinion also includes lots of other very ugly facts (too ugly to repeat here) that would lead very few people to conclude, as Weinstein did, that the defendant\u2019s sentence was unjust.", "description": "2006\u2014At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination of Michael B.
