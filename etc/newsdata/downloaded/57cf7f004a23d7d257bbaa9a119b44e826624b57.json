When this \u201cBolivarian Revolution\u201d started to change the constitution and morph our laws I was just an introverted child that had just moved to the capital of the country, fascinated by video games, cartoons, and Power Rangers and with an overactive imagination.\n\nThis perpetual revolution has laid down a status quo in the country that often forces you to lose your personal aspirations, to cast away your future, hopes, and dreams; it changes you in many ways until you\u2019re no longer a citizen \u2014 you\u2019re merely a survivor.\n\nToday, here I stand, more or less that same introverted kid \u2014 but with 20 years of ever-increasing hardships upon my shoulders; a lesser version of what I could\u2019ve been, clinging to those memories where everything was simpler and all of it made sense.\n\nThis is a personal account of what has my life become after twenty years of Bolivarian Revolution\u2014 20 years that comprise two-thirds of my life.\n\nI\u2019ve done so many bread lines that I\u2019ve lost count, I\u2019ve engaged in bartering of food and medicine, I\u2019m actively taking expired meds because it\u2019s simply better than nothing, and I\u2019ve adapted every aspect of my livelihood around the tribulations inherent to living in Socialist Venezuela while taking care of my younger brother who can\u2019t fend for himself given his mental condition. It hasn\u2019t been easy since we\u2019re two socially inept siblings, but we keep going no matter what.\n\nSocialism has slowly eroded the functional existence of every aspect of our lives, from our freedom of speech to our economic liberties, our access to healthcare and personal documents to our water supply. Each of these structural collapses \u2013 the absence of healthcare, the worthlessness of our currency, systemic corruption in the government and military, and widespread censorship \u2013 have affected me personally.\n\nSocialism is a trendy topic in the United States at the moment, which means my story is relevant beyond Venezuela\u2019s borders. Over the course of this series, I hope to inform American readers about the realities of existence \u2013 and survival \u2013 in a socialist country. And I hope that by reading my stories, Americans will be forewarned enough that they remain distant stories, rather than firsthand experiences.\n\nThe Cult of Personality\n\nEvery revolution and socialist/communist regime needs its great leader figures, its martyrs, and vanguard. Venezuela is no exception.\n\nCirca 2007, Hugo Chavez was no longer referred to by his party as just \u201cPresident Chavez\u201d \u2013 nope, he was now called the \u201cCommander-President,\u201d a subtle change that conveyed a heavy ideological weight.\n\nFollowing his death in 2013, Chavez was elevated to \u201cSupreme and Eternal Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution.\u201d Please, believe me when I say I wish I was joking. The Cuartel de la Monta\u00f1a, the military headquarters where Ch\u00e1vez hid when his 1992 coup failed, became his mausoleum, his temple.\n\nThe fact that this pristine quasi-temple sits atop a mountain surrounded by shanty houses is the perfect encapsulation of socialism.\n\nPilgrimage to his sacred revolutionary shrine is expected of you if you want to partake in the glory of socialism. Every day a salvo is fired at the hour of his \u201csowing\u201d or \u201csiembra\u201d in Spanish (in socialism leaders don\u2019t die, they are \u201csown in the ground\u201d instead. Cuba recently did the same with Fidel Castro).\n\nThe \u201cperformance\u201d always ends with an exclamation that begins with \u201cIndependence and Socialist Fatherland.\u201d\n\nSouth Americans have always been a religious people. We\u2019re mostly Catholic and they\u2019ve sure known how to exploit this. At the height of his power, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez felt mightier than God, going as far as to claim that he no longer believed in a god. After he was diagnosed with cancer, he started to openly beg Christ to not take him just yet.\n\nThe \u201cEyes of Chavez\u201d and his infamous signature have become quasi-religious symbols. His eyes are plastered all over the place here in Venezuela. They serve as a reminder that the Supreme and Eternal Commander sees all. His signature serves a similar purpose, a reminder of who to thank for that free house you now live in (but don\u2019t actually own).\n\nReruns of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s old Alo Presidente weekly TV show are aired on the State\u2019s main channel like gospel; the regime\u2019s authorities love to claim that they\u2019re simply \u201cpreserving Chavez\u2019s legacy.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t enough, you can always get the mark of the bea \u2014 sorry, I mean, Chavez\u2019s signature tattooed on your skin.\n\nMaduro is also not just the \u201cPresident.\u201d He has been fashioned into something greater and is often referred to as the Worker President, the Driver of Victories, and the son of Ch\u00e1vez. If all of this sounds bizarre well \u2014 welcome to socialist Venezuela.\n\nSure, it\u2019s not North Korea, but it\u2019s just as abhorrent if you ask me.\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution loves to break your legs and then demand eternal gratitude because they\u2019re loaning you a pair of broken crutches.\n\nThey\u2019ve given out free housing to the poor, yes; but these people do not own the apartments. Their \u201cCLAP\u201d box subsidized food program provides citizens with small amounts of low quality imported items, such as old beans, pasta, spoiled milk, oil, or tuna \u2014 and they expect you to feed your family through an entire month with it.\n\nThe program is corrupt, the quality of the items contained in these boxes leaves much to be desired, and they\u2019re exported at double their retail price. When the time for a pro-regime rally comes, you damn well better wear that red shirt and attend, unless you want to risk losing your public sector job, house, and breadcrumbs.\n\nThese are two of the ways the government\u2019s \u201cbenefits\u201d are used to keep its sympathizers in check. One of the newest and most dangerous ones is their \u201cFatherland Card\u201d program, a system that was largely created with Chinese assistance, based on their Social Credit System.\n\nWhile its full-blown implementation slowed to a crawl due to several circumstances, the end goal is the same: absolute control of Venezuela\u2019s citizens to force them to submit to the dictatorship or languish as second-class citizens.\n\nThe Fatherland Card database contains a dangerously high amount of information, from names, numbers, addresses, work information, income, family members, vehicle information, and etcetera.\n\nSocial benefits and monetary bonuses are now being distributed through this program. If you or any of your family members need a medicine then their goal is for you to obtain it through this; refuse to fall in line and you\u2019ll risk losing access to it.\n\nAccess to subsidized gasoline through this program has been one of their goals as well. Our gasoline is so absurdly cheap it might as well be free \u2014 paradoxically, you will be long dead before you\u2019re able to save enough money for a new vehicle.\n\nThe only reason this hasn\u2019t been implemented yet it\u2019s because they hit a roadblock due to the precarious and obsolete state of our internet infrastructure.\n\nUltimately, the glorification of Ch\u00e1vez as the Supreme and Eternal Commander of the Revolution, and the creation of a scenario where the people are forced to depend on the government\u2019s breadcrumbs to barely survive, has only served to subdue our citizens, bombarding us with a non-stop ideological narrative that presents them as the heroes that are saving us from a calamity of their own creation, fighting a good fight against the great enemy: The American Empire and Capitalism.\n\nOf course, that evil capitalism they fiercely denounce? It\u2019s totally fine for their sons and family members.\n\nAn obedient, docile, and subservient country, desperate to survive and yearning for a better life, deprived and stripped of hope. Cuba has done it, North Korea has done it, and unfortunately, Maduro\u2019s regime has ramped up its efforts towards achieving this goal \u2014 I don\u2019t want this to be our fate.", "description": "Venezuela, my home country, has it all: beautiful and breathtaking landscapes, abundant resources, even unique wonders of nature.", "authors": ["Christian K.
