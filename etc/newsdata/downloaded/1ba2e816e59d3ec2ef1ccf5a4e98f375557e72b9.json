The only salvation this afternoon brought to the 59,808 who bought tickets for an event some called \u201cThe Ineptitude Bowl\u201d is that Miami Coach Brian Flores decided to go for a two-point conversion after the Dolphins scored a touchdown with six seconds left, refusing to let the day extend into overtime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInside their locker room, the Redskins, playing their first game since head coach Jay Gruden was fired early Monday and replaced on an interim basis by Bill Callahan, weren\u2019t surprised Flores decided to go for two. And though they had allowed a team that had scored just two touchdowns all year to score two in the fourth quarter, turning a 17-3 lead into a 17-16 heart attack, they felt calm in the chaos. They knew Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was either going to throw to wide receiver DeVante Parker or running back Kenyan Drake, and were ready for either possibility.\n\nThe throw was a screen to Drake, who dropped the ball. Not that he would have gone anywhere. Washington\u2019s defensive players knew they had the play stopped.\n\n\u201cHe was going to be stuffed,\u201d safety Landon Collins said.\n\nAD\n\nBut as happy as they were, uneasiness filled the room as well. The Redskins have never felt like an 0-5 team this season, preferring to see themselves as a group that was a few breaks from a more respectable record. And yet they found themselves in a death fight at the end against the Dolphins, who have stripped their of many of their best players in a rebuild that many have called \u201ctanking,\u201d and had lost their first four games by the combined score of 163-26.\n\nAD\n\nNot only had they blown a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but they had failed to convert on nine of 11 third-down attempts, were saved from the humiliation of fumbling an onside kick by an offsides penalty, and let Miami go 75 yards in 1:56 at the game\u2019s end to score the touchdown that set up the botched two-point conversion. They permitted Fitzpatrick, a journeyman backup in relief of starter Josh Rosen, to throw for 132 yards in the third quarter. Despite Callahan\u2019s insistence they commit to fundamentals and details, they had coverage breakdowns and critical penalties.\n\nThey knew that even thought they had stuffed the two-point conversion, they also were very, very lucky Fitzpatrick threw the screen to Drake that they had been expecting.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let them back in the game like that,\u201d left tackle Donald Penn said, shaking his head. \u201cWe had opportunities in the fourth quarter to put the game away and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat worry, though, would have to wait. The Redskins hadn\u2019t won a game since last Dec. 16, and the taste of victory was good, no matter how unorthodox it was. Callahan said he believed the emphasis he had put on fitness and discipline during the week had helped his players in the game. He used the word \u201cresilient\u201d to describe the way the defense had handled the final minutes, saying the unit \u201canswered when they had to.\u201d\n\nMostly, though, Callahan was thrilled with running back Adrian Peterson. From his first news conference after Gruden\u2019s Monday firing, the new coach said he intended to have Peterson run and run and run until the Redskins had reestablished themselves as a powerful rushing team. Then on Sunday he did that, sending the 34-year-old Peterson into the line over and over until finally he broke through. In the end, Peterson had 23 carries for 118 yards.\n\nAD\n\nMore importantly, Peterson\u2019s success set up quarterback Case Keenum to hit rookie receiver Terry McLaurin with 25- and 33-yard touchdown passes that helped build the 17-3 fourth quarter lead.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat really complemented what we did in the run game,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nStill, the statistics all seemed hollow. Miami came into the game with the league\u2019s worst rushing offense and defense. It was next-to-last in passing yards allowed and last in touchdown passes allowed. Compared to what other teams have done against the Dolphins this year, the Redskins 311 yards of total offense wasn\u2019t all that spectacular.\n\nThey had won, yes, but it came in a game that should raise questions about how many more times they can win again this season. Their defense swarmed starting quarterback Josh Rosen, sacking him five times and forcing him to throw two interceptions, but they had little answer for his replacement, Fitzpatrick, in the fourth quarter. The Dolphins had given the Redskins a chance to dominate, and in the end they barely survived.\n\nA win, though, is a win. And in a near-empty locker room Sunday, Penn sighed heavily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this league 13 years and wins come hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this was easy, everyone would be 10-0.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Washington\u2019s players are just thankful for a victory, no matter how ugly, after Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s comeback bid falls short.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f2hZatfzKFnUj1WnsuD96iFbJQk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2OZNDHN7YI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
