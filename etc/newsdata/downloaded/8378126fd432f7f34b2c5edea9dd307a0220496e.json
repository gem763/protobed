It's devastated the whole family and local community.\n\n\"They have impacted so many people's lives for the better.\"\n\nKim is understood to have been four months pregnant.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nHer and Danny also have a four-year-old daughter together, and Kim is mum to a 15-year-old daughter too.\n\nIn one inspirational post on Facebook she wrote: \"We must never wait to begin anything at all.

The funny thing is that those that we are trying to find acceptance from are more than likely craving acceptance from us also.\n\n\"I found that writing in an appreciation diary every night about all of the things that I appreciate about my life and day helped me to start acknowledging all of the things that I loved about me and my life.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nCousin Bobby added: \"Whenever i was going through a tough time, Danny would always be there to guide me and help me find clarity.\n\n\"I have so many memories that I'll cherish forever.

We're all just heartbroken.\"\n\nClose friend Steph Critchlow has also laid bare her pain at losing her two friends who were so \"full of love\".\n\nIn a heartrending tribute to Mirror Online, she said: \"Kim and Danny, 2 beautiful souls, so full of gratitude and salt of the earth. I'm blessed to have known them.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"I met Kim and Danny in 2015 when our children were months old at baby massage, we connected instantly and ever since we stayed good friends.\n\n\"Once, Kim spent nine hours putting dreadlocks into my hair when the children were babies, though a little stressful as my son was a little wild, Kim's patience just shone through as it always did and with laughter and smiles she got the job done.\"\n\nSteph continued: \"They were full of love, love to the people and to the ground that they stood on and to be around them filled me with such content and fulfilment.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"In a world full of darkness, Kim and Danny found the light, they were the light and together they shone and everybody knew of it. Their love for each other was so strong.\n\n\"Kim found her yoga and spread the word of love and light through this to many. Danny started his writing and together they spent many time away on yoga retreats.\n\n\"As for the girls Aveyja - 4 years and Maicee 15 years, they gave their everything. Home educating was the way for them, they were such a loving family.\n\n\"As time went on and our lives grew we only saw each other occasionally, but we all kept in touch and spiritually we were always there.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"At such a tragic time right now, to remember them as they were, who they were and what they gave to many, it's so inspiring.\n\n\"Danny a hero, saving the love of his life. Kim recently shared this script, 'The planet doesn't need more successful people, the planet desperately needs more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of all kind - Dalai Lama'.\n\n\"That just describes them perfectly. I am truly heartbroken and I will miss them.\"\n\nFriends have set up a fundraising page to cover funeral costs and a memorial, as well as provide for the couple's daughters.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Tributes have been paid to \"beautiful souls\" Kim Fletcher, 33, and Danny Johnson, 34, from Stoke-on-Trent", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538069.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kim-Fletcher.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
