He also enjoyed Thai Boxing and listening to trance music.\n\nOn the night of Thursday, February 21, Leighanne dropped Bailey off at a friends' house in Littleborough, where he stayed for several hours.\n\nShe was told he was heading home shortly before 11pm and she believed he was going to walk back home to Milnrow.\n\nBailey had, in fact, borrowed his pal's Carrera bike.\n\n(Image: MEN MEDIA)\n\nIt did have lights, but they were not charged and were not working.\n\nBailey was not wearing reflective clothing or a helmet and may have been under the influence of alcohol, the inquest heard.\n\nThe driver of the Fiesta said he had been at the The Victoria snooker club in Littleborough and was also heading towards Milnrow down Willdhouse Lane in Smithybridge.\n\nHe said in his statement he had his full beam headlights on while travelling along the 50mph stretch, but dipped them as he went around a bend as a car was coming the other way.\n\nThe driver said be hit his brakes after one of his passengers said they thought they saw a cyclist.\n\nHe said he believes he only had 'half a second' to react after seeing Bailey himself.\n\n(Image: MEN MEDIA)\n\nEmergency services were called, and, upon hearing news of the accident and fearing he was involved, Bailey's mum raced to the scene.\n\nBailey was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital. Despite medics' best efforts, he could not be saved. He was pronounced dead shortly after midnight on February 22.\n\nA post-mortem ruled his caused of death was a head injury.\n\nThe driver, who stopped after the collision, provided a negative breath test. A drugs screening also came back clear.\n\nIn the report, Detective Constable Edward Lister said: \"He had no lights or helmet.\n\n\"The area was very dark with limited visibility.\n\n\"He was wearing dark clothing with no reflective material. He was described as being intoxicated when he started his journey.\n\n\"A witnesses said his phone was playing loud music and CCTV suggests he was cycling in the centre of the southbound carriageway.\"\n\nAfter analysing distances and reaction times, the officer said: \"I am of the opinion that even if [the driver] had recognised Mr Sutcliffe as an immediate hazard at the first available opportunity, there was insufficient time for him to react and therefore the collision was unaviodable.\"\n\n\"He [Mr Sutcliffe] placed himself in a vulnerable position by cycling without lights or other safety equipment and by cycling in the centre of an unlit road.\"\n\nAssistant Coroner Michael Salt recorded a conclusion that Bailey died as the result of a road traffic collision.\n\nHe said: \"I have no reason to defer from the findings of the police in this case.\n\n\"Bailey Sutcliffe borrowed a friends' bicycle - it appeared to have lights on but they weren't charged.\n\n\"He may have seen them and thought they were working - we just don't know.\n\n\"He was playing music which will have also affected his perception of traffic.\n\n\"Having been struck from behind he will have very quickly sustained the head injury and been unaware of what was happening, certainly that's my perception of events.\n\n\"These things have been repeated many times - but if you are going to cycle you must always wear a helmet, you must comply with the highway code, not cycle under the influence of alcohol and always use a cycle path if available.\n\n\"I say that with no criticism of Bailey, as he was just 16 years-old.\n\n\"I say that to try and avoid other parents having to suffer and going through what Bailey's parents went through.\"", "description": "Bailey Paul Sutcliffe, 16, was struck by a Ford Fiesta in Littleborough, Greater Manchester", "authors": ["Chris Slater", "Image", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751316.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bailey-Sutcliffe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
