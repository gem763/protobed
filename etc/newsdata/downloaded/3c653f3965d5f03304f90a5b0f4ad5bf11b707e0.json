It primarily indicates a company\u2019s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.\n\nThese stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that a company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.\n\nHence, one may consider a company\u2019s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.\n\nMeasures to Identify Liquid Stocks\n\nCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company\u2019s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio \u2014 also known as working capital ratio \u2014 below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.\n\nQuick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio \u2014 also called \u201cacid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" \u2014 indicates a company\u2019s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.\n\nCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company\u2019s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.\n\nSo, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company\u2019s financial condition.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company\u2019s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.\n\nIn order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.\n\nCurrent Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)\n\nAsset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company\u2019s efficiency.)\n\nZacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGrowth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)\n\nThese criteria have narrowed down the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only 10.\n\nHere are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screen:\n\nIrvine, CA-based Tilly's Inc.
