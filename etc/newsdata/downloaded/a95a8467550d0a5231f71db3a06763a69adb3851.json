I hope they bring it back next year.\u2019\n\nThe free-for-all is believed to have lasted for nine days until Amazon realised what was going on last week.\n\nThis prompted a period of mourning for students, as some slammed others for spoiling their fun by sharing the apparent glitch on social media.\n\nOne student tweeted: \u2018Cheers to everyone that tweeted about \u201cwelcome5\u201d so it inevitably got taken away.\n\n\u2018This is why we can\u2019t have nice things.\u2019\n\nAnother wrote: \u2018R.I.P amazon code Welcome5 You were good to us when no-one else was.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
