That time, his own team was also deeply rattled. Multiple high-ranking officials, including then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, resigned shortly after his announcement. Trump later backtracked, saying U.S. troops would stay until they could ensure the Kurdish forces who led the fight against the Islamic State were safe and that the terrorist group was completely gone.\n\nAD\n\nThe Oil Fields discussed in my speech on Turkey/Kurds yesterday were held by ISIS until the United States took them over with the help of the Kurds. We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nBut the uproar last winter was something of a warning sign for Europeans, who were aware that between Trump\u2019s stated desire to bring U.S. troops home and his habit of making snap decisions, the status quo in northeastern Syria remained tenuous. Still, when the White House suddenly abandoned years of U.S. policy this month, European allies were left racing to figure out what to do next.\n\n\u201cFrom a force protection standpoint and political standpoint, all European efforts in the northeast hinged on American commitment,\u201d said Tobias Schneider, a Berlin-based research fellow at the Global Public Policy Institute. \u201cSuddenly at once, without having any influence in the entire decision, Europeans were left out in the cold.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the weeks since, the fact that key European leaders do not have much of a backup plan has been put on full display.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he saw it as a positive sign that members of the alliance are coming forward with suggestions, although he acknowledged \u201cthere are many challenges and many questions that have to be answered.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDefense ministers belonging to the NATO alliance gathered in Brussels on Thursday, and ahead of the meeting, diplomats asked about Germany\u2019s plan and said they looked forward to learning more about it from Kramp-Karrenbauer. But several noted that it has yet to earn real backing even from inside Germany.\n\nAD\n\nSchneider called Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s proposal \u201ccompletely unmoored from reality\u201d and said she probably publicized such a suggestion to gain attention at home, where she is considered a likely successor for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who plans to step down in 2021, at the end of her term. But no matter what types of military proposals are now made, Schneider said, once Trump withdrew troops, \u201cthere was nothing left to do.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in Russia this week, where they agreed to jointly patrol the Syrian border against Kurdish fighters, deepening the unlikelihood of European involvement and securing a major win for each of them, as Erdogan inches closer to his objective of pushing back the Kurds and Putin secures an outsize role in the future of Syria.\n\nAD\n\nBut that leaves Europe even more irrelevant in the region.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the E.U. or any other European country has a great plan to suggest,\u201d Jim Townsend, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy, told Today\u2019s WorldView. In recent weeks, he said, there has probably been even more increased caution over a new approach due to fears that Trump could quickly change U.S. policy as he has in the past. \u201cNo European wants to find out a week later that the rug has been pulled out from under them because Trump tweeted something else.\u201d\n\nAfter announcing the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Trump wished anyone who wanted to help protect the Kurds well, noting on Twitter that he hopes \u201cthey all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the Islamic State crumbled, the men who poured into SDF prisons were presented with orange jumpsuits. Remembering Guantanamo and the years of bloody ISIS videos, alleged fighters thought this was a sign they\u2019d be executed: https://t.co/X6VlRJN8fy \u2014 Louisa Loveluck (@leloveluck) October 24, 2019\n\nEurope\u2019s geographical proximity to Syria is in fact adding to Europeans\u2019 anxieties. Many suspected fighters and their families being held in prisons and detention centers in Kurdish-controlled areas are European citizens, spreading concerns that if they were to escape, they could end up back in Europe without a proper vetting process. European countries are also eager to avoid more mass displacement in Syria that could lead to another major refugee crisis in Europe.\n\nBut Europe has \u201cno plan on paper and no leverage,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThe people calling the shots are the Russians, Iranians, Turks and Assad.\u201d\n\nMichael Birnbaum in Brussels contributed to this report.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
