Defense Secretary Mark Esper was scheduled to discuss the closely held details of the deal with President Donald Trump in a Sept. 3 meeting, according to senior administration officials. If Trump approves and a deal is struck, it could begin a withdrawal of some 5,400 U.S. troops, roughly a third of the present force, from five bases within 135 days.\n\nBut the deal doesn\u2019t ensure several crucial things, those familiar with the discussions tell TIME. It doesn\u2019t guarantee the continued presence of U.S. counterterrorism forces to battle al Qaeda, the survival of the pro-U.S. government in Kabul, or even an end to the fighting in Afghanistan. \u201cNo one speaks with certainty. None,\u201d said an Afghan official taking part in briefings on the deal with Khalilzad. \u201cIt is all based on hope. There is no trust. There is no history of trust. There is no evidence of honesty and sincerity from the Taliban,\u201d and intercepted communications \u201cshow that they think they have fooled the U.S. while the U.S. believes that should the Taliban cheat, they will pay a hefty price.\u201d\n\nThat may explain why Pompeo is declining to put his name on the deal. The Taliban asked for Pompeo to sign an agreement with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the official name of the government founded by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1996, four U.S., Afghan and European officials familiar with the discussions tell TIME. Having the Secretary of State sign such a document would amount to de facto recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political entity, and he declined to do so, the Afghan officials say. Pompeo\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nThere are two alternatives. Khalilzad himself may sign it. Or the U.S. and the Taliban may simply issue a joint statement, supported in turn by the U.S.-backed government in Kabul and a number of other countries, including Japan, Russia and China, two Afghan sources familiar with the deliberations tell TIME.\n\nThat diplomatic sleight of hand might solve the signature problem, but it won\u2019t do much to address the core challenges facing those who want to give peace in Afghanistan a chance after four decades of war. As it stands, the agreement would set the stage for the withdrawal of most American forces by the end of November 2020 if the Taliban do three things: open negotiations with the U.S.-backed Afghan government; reduce violence near areas U.S. forces control; and keep foreign militants out of the areas they control, according to current and former U.S., Afghan, and European officials, who all spoke anonymously to describe the sensitive and fractious deliberations.\n\nU.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats who have served in Afghanistan worry that once a withdrawal is underway, it will be irreversible, given Trump\u2019s promise to end the U.S. involvement in the war there, the fast-approaching 2020 U.S. elections, and the absence of public support for the war. The price of peace, they fear, might include reversing much of the hard-won progress towards building a stable country over nearly two decades of war. These officials fear: a roll back of civil, human, and women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan; a weakening of the national, regional, and local governments; the deterioration of anti-Taliban military and law enforcement forces; and a rise in corruption.\n\nIt is \u201cnot clear whether peace is possible,\u201d nine former high-ranking U.S. officials, including a former deputy secretary of state, warned in a Sept. 3 letter distributed by the Atlantic Council. \u201cSecondly, there is an outcome far worse than the status quo, namely a return to the total civil war that consumed Afghanistan.\u201d", "description": "Tentative First Steps Towards Peace Leave Major Questions Unanswered, Raise Fears of a Return to Taliban Rule", "authors": ["Kimberly Dozier"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L0NYu0s7__VGEtcOl716IQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3d81ad119bd60ed0eef7a84e460bd598"}
