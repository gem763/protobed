Ozone is a molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts. In the stratosphere, roughly seven to 25 miles above Earth's surface, the ozone layer acts like a sunscreen. It shields the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. This can cause skin cancer and cataracts, suppress immune systems and also damage plants. Ozone is produced at tropical latitudes and distributed around the globe. Closer to the ground, ozone can also be created by reactions between sunlight and pollution from vehicle emissions and other sources, forming harmful smog.\n\nCrop scientists Lisa Ainsworth of the US Department of Agriculture and colleagues measured how increasing atmospheric ozone levels in a field impacted corn growth and yields using a sophisticated emission system that monitors wind conditions to maintain a chosen dose of the target gas.\n\n'Ozone enters plants the same way carbon dioxide does: It diffuses from the atmosphere into the leaf,' said Dr Ainsworth.\n\n'Carbon dioxide is a nutrient for plants. All the carbon that ends up in the grain comes through the leaf first.'\n\nOzone is a highly reactive molecule, however, which damages biological tissues and impairs photosynthetic carbon capture in plant leaves.'\n\n'Basically, ozone accelerates the ageing of the leaf,' said paper co-author and plant biologist Andrew Leakey of the University of Illinois.\n\n'Carbon dioxide is a nutrient for plants. All the carbon that ends up in the grain comes through the leaf first.'\n\n'But ozone is a highly reactive molecule that damages biological tissues and impairs photosynthetic carbon capture in plant leaves. Even background levels of ozone do some damage.'\n\n'Our research suggests that current ozone levels decrease corn yields by as much as 10 per cent.'\n\n'That's as much as drought or flooding or any single pest or disease, but this is a relatively unstudied component of yield loss in the U.S.'\n\nOzone \u2014 which is released as a by product of fossil fuel usage \u2014 effectively prematurely ages the crops and makes them less efficient at making energy to grow\n\nThe researchers experiment with 45 hybrid corn plants, representing all major types of corn including broom, dent and flint corn as well as popcorn.\n\nThey discovered that some members of the corn family are more susceptible to diminishing yields when ozone air pollution levels are high.\n\n'We found two maize lines whose offspring were more sensitive to ozone pollution, regardless of which other types of corn we bred them with,' Dr Leakey said.\n\n'Their genetic deficiencies manifested in different ways when exposed to the high ozone conditions.'\n\nDiscovering the genetic underpinnings of these differences could help plant scientists develop ozone-resistant corn, they added.\n\nSadly, the exact genetic make-up of commercial crops is a closely-kept secret so adapting them to air pollution will have to be undertaken by breeders.\n\n'We don't know if these corn varieties have the same Achilles' heels' Dr Leakey said.\n\n'Breeders would not know about these differences since they are not apparent under clean-air conditions.'\n\nResearchers found that two of the most common commercial varieties of the popular vegetable suffer particularly badly when exposed to more of the gas\n\n'The level that we're fumigating to in this study is a level that is commonly found today in China and India,' said Dr Ainsworth.\n\n'So, it's not excessively high, even though we're using a concentration that is two-and-a-half times the level of background ozone in central Illinois.'\n\n'It's important to understand how plants are going to respond to climate change before the climate changes,' Dr Leakey added.\n\n'That is the only way we can find the solutions that will be needed in the future.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Global Change Biology.", "description": "Crop scientists Lisa Ainsworth of the US Department of Agriculture and colleagues measured how increasing atmospheric ozone levels in a field impacted corn growth and yields.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/11/19149932-0-image-a-50_1569926518538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
