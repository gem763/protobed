They struggled to an extraordinary degree,\u201d Conte told Sky Sport Italia, as per Football Italia.\n\n\u201cIt was our fourth game in nine days, with the same players. Any situation or result is acceptable at that point. All we can do is thank them for the spirit they showed to hang in until the end.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s an anomaly and I haven\u2019t seen any other side with a fixture list like that, so it seemed very strange to me.\n\n\u201cSome games you need to win just by suffering. They must understand that for many reasons, as for example the hosts are pushing to turn the result around, you have to soak up the pressure, hang in there and I challenge anyone to play four games in nine days while getting a victory at Brescia.\u201d\n\nInter went ahead midway through the first half with a fortuitous goal from Lautaro Martinez, whose shot deflected off defender Andrea Cistana, before Lukaku score with a stinging drive just past the hour mark.\n\nInter defender Milan Skriniar\u2019s own goal in the 76th minute brought a feisty Brescia right back into the game and ensured a nervy finale for the visitors.\n\nInter took early control and went ahead after 23 minutes. Martinez tried his luck from 25 metres, the ball hit Cistana\u2019s outstretched leg and looped over helpless debutant goalkeeper Enrico Alfonso who was stranded.\n\nInter midfielder Roberto Gagliardini was lucky not to be sent off when tempers flared at the end of the first half, escaping with a yellow card despite pushing an opponent\u2019s head with his hand.\n\nBrescia, who are 18th in the 20-team table with seven points, were far more aggressive after the break and the complexion of the game changed completed.\n\nHome striker Mario Balotelli, facing his old club, had a low shot turned around the post by Samir Handanovic and the Slovenian goalkeeper also did well to block Alfredo Donnarumma\u2019s close range effort.\n\nBut, in a rare break upfield, Inter snatched a second in the 63rd minute as Lukaku collected the ball near the touchline, cut inside and blasted a shot into the net from 25 metres, the Belgian\u2019s seventh league goal of season.\n\nBalotelli saw a close-range header blocked by Handanovic and then blasted the rebound over before Brescia finally got their goal when Dimitri Bisoli\u2019s shot was saved by Handanovic but ricocheted straight off Skriniar and into the net.\n\nBalotelli then had an overhead kick charged down but Inter held on for three precious points to leave them on 25 from 10 matches ahead of Juve on 23 with a game in hand.", "description": "Antonio Conte has said that Inter Milan beat Brescia through pure determination on Tuesday night \u2013 and has warned fans that the club will not be able to keep up their fine run of form for much longer. A stunning strike by Romelu Lukaku gave Inter a 2-1 win at Brescia on Tuesday although they had to cling on for three points in the face of heavy pressure from the promoted side.", "authors": ["Adam Hamdani"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/10/conte-lukaku.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
