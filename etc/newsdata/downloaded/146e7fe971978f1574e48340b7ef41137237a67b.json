Though Trump has long called on European nations to take on a greater share of the burden of U.S. military assistance, America remains the primary guarantor of Ukrainian security and sovereignty. The separatist war in eastern Ukraine continues; the Crimean peninsula is still in Russian hands; there is always the threat of further Russian incursions. Any rollback of U.S. support, and any setbacks in the political relationship between the two countries, is cause for serious concern in Kiev.\n\nAt the same time, however, a rift in the Ukraine-U.S. relationship can also hurt America in its own struggle against Russia. Ukraine\u2019s spy services and military forces have become an important U.S. partner in countering Russia\u2014especially in the realm of hybrid warfare, which Moscow has deployed so effectively against America and its allies. Lost amid the accusations that Trump has used U.S. aid as leverage to push Ukraine to do his political bidding is the fact that while Kiev is heavily reliant on America to defend against Russia, America needs help from Kiev too.\n\nThis is the dynamic between the two men as they meet, amid the swirling American scandal, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York today.\n\nRead: The problem with the whistle-blower system\n\nOn the one side is Trump, whose political standing is newly precarious as the crisis over his overtures to Zelensky intensifies in Washington. Trump\u2019s go-to defense in the face of scandal\u2014admitting much of it and asking, in effect, \u201cSo what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\u2014seems unlikely to head off the intensifying push for impeachment in the House of Representatives. Yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn the other side is Zelensky, who swept into office on an anti-corruption platform this spring and has pushed to enact it, starting with a bold move to call a parliamentary election that saw his nascent political party awarded a surprisingly strong mandate.\n\nLike Trump, Zelensky is a political outsider who gained fame as the star of a popular TV show. His character was the polar opposite of the persona that Trump displayed on The Apprentice. Zelensky played a schoolteacher who unexpectedly finds himself leader of Ukraine and works to instill a sense of morality and patriotism in its government. In the kind of plotline that might have appeared on his series, Servant of the People, the man who played the humble and ethical public official now finds himself facing down the self-styled backroom dealmaker and master of the quid pro quo.\n\nNone of this is to say that Zelensky, and Ukraine more generally, are immune to Trump\u2019s bullying. The details of the whistle-blower complaint that sparked the scandal are still unknown; the complaint reportedly involves multiple actions by Trump, including his correspondence with Zelensky. There are also no definitive answers to how Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have responded to Trump\u2019s demands, though there have been no reports to suggest that they complied with them. Zelensky has yet to comment publicly on the scandal. Insisting that he said nothing inappropriate on the phone call with Zelensky that has fallen under scrutiny, Trump announced yesterday that he would declassify and release an unredacted transcript. The White House is also reportedly preparing to release the whistle-blower complaint to Congress and working on a deal to let the whistle-blower testify before its intelligence committees.", "description": "Trump\u2019s push to get Ukraine\u2019s new president to do his political bidding threatens to undermine a key U.S. partnership in countering Russia.", "authors": ["Mike Giglio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74EJJ-1/facebook.jpg?1569353555", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
