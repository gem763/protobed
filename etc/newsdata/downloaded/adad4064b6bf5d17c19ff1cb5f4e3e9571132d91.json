The following evening, at least one riot police member was killed, the interior ministry said.\n\nIn videos distributed on social media, protesters could be seen ducking into streets littered with burning tyres as volleys of gunfire and suspected heavy weapons were heard.\n\nFor the first time, the army acknowledged using \u201cexcessive force\u201d in Sunday\u2019s incident and said it would hold commanding officers accountable.\n\nAmnesty International welcomed the admission as \u201ca first step that must be translated on the ground, to rein in the behaviour of security forces and the army.\n\n\u201cThe next step is accountability,\u201d it said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Conspiracy theories\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe particularly chaotic scenes in Sadr City followed several days of witnesses reporting security forces unleashing tear gas and live rounds to disperse protests while authorities said \u201cunidentified snipers\u201d shot at both protesters and police.\n\nMore footage is expected to emerge online once internet services fully return across Iraq, where authorities have restricted access since Wednesday night.\n\nThe tentative calm returning to Baghdad comes a few weeks ahead of Arbaeen, the massive pilgrimage that sees millions of Shiite Muslims walk to the holy city of Karbala, south of Baghdad.\n\nNearly two million came last year from neighbouring Iran, which has urged citizens to delay their travel into Iraq in light of the protest violence.\n\nIts supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday \u201cenemies\u201d were trying to drive a wedge between Tehran and Baghdad, in an apparent allusion to the protests.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed hours later by the powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, which warned that those who sought to \u201cdefame Iraq will be punished\u201d.\n\nIn an apparent response, British ambassador Jon Wilks said on Tuesday there was \u201cno need for conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cIraq must protect Iraqis.
