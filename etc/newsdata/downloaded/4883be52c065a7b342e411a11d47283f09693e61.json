But Lottie's behaviour was outrageous.\n\n'She also made the homophobic comments, which were totally unnecessary. Contestants complained to producers in the house and asked them to look into it.'\n\nThe source stated that producers would only leave when candidates had gone to bed and were aware of the comments being made.\n\nThey added: 'The racism issue is a big one and it is going to blow up in the show and the BBC's face. It is not going to go away and people are shocked with how it's been handled.'\n\nLottie is said to have rebuked the claims and said they were 'untrue'. But fellow candidate Souleyman Bah claimed 'of course it's true'.\n\nBefore filming starts on the show, contestants are made to sign a form which acknowledges that they will be kicked out for bad behaviour.\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline this morning a spokesperson for The Apprentice said: 'We are currently looking into the circumstances regarding a complaint.'\n\nThis is while production company Boundless were not unable to be reached.\n\nIn a statement, Lottie said: Lottie said: 'I categorically deny being a racist, transphobic or homophobic. I have no further comment.'", "description": "New claims have been launched against Lottie Lion following her time at The Apprentice house in north London.
