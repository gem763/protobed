It would have been a great present to inspire potential young ornithologists, but as it is they'll probably end up disappointed when they go out for that Boxing Day walk and fail to find a hummingbird.'\n\nMany on social media saw the funny side, with one tweeting: 'I love watching the hummingbirds eating the nuts in the garden.'\n\nMany on social media saw the funny side, with one tweeting: 'I love watching the hummingbirds eating the nuts in the garden'\n\nAnother wrote: 'I'll be out scanning the hedges for hummingbirds when the rain stopes.'\n\nAnd one joked: 'This is not just any birdwatcher's jigsaw.
