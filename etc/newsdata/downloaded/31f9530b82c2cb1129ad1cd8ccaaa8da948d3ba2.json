Combining a broad portfolio with a minimum-volatility strategy should help reduce risk and smooth out returns relative to a market-cap-weighted benchmark. Throw in a low expense ratio and the result is a compelling, all-in-one fund for long-term investors. IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility Global ETF's (ACWV) proven ability to cut back on risk and provide better risk-adjusted performance than a market-cap-weighted index earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Silver.\n\nThe fund tracks the MSCI ACWI Minimum Volatility Index. It uses an optimizer that selects and weights stocks from the MSCI All Country World Index in a way that minimizes expected volatility.
