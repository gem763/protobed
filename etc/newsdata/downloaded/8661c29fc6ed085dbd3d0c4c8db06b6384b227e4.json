That leaves hopes of a deal based on Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals hanging by a thread. Any deal would have to be formally signed off at the EU Council on October 17 if there is any hope of getting it through Parliament by the end of the month.\n\nOpposition MPs believe they have Mr Johnson trapped as the Act will force him to request an extension on October 19.\n\nA senior No.10 source has said the Benn Act, which Mr Johnson refers to as the Surrender Act, will undermine negotiations with EU leaders ( pictured with Macron in Paris for a Brexit meeting on August 22)\n\nHowever, a new report suggests the Prime Minister is prepared to launch a legal battle in the Supreme Court in an effort to avoid having to write to the EU asking for a delay to Brexit.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Johnson could even give evidence in court to persuade judges against forcing him to ask for a Brexit delay.\n\nIn the phone call with Mr Macron, Mr Johnson told the French leader that the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK will stay in the EU after October 31 and urged the EU to \u2018match the compromises\u2019 the UK has made.\n\nAnd a senior No 10 source said: \u2018The Surrender Act and its authors are undermining negotiations, but if EU leaders are betting that it will prevent No Deal, that would be an historic misunderstanding.\u2019\n\nYesterday, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay went to the Netherlands for talks and is expected in other EU capitals today and tomorrow.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s EU \u2018sherpa\u2019 David Frost will return to Brussels this morning and the PM is expected to continue telephone diplomacy.\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay (pictured with host Andrew Marr facing away) went for talks in the Netherlands and is expected at other EU capitals today\n\nBut there was precious little sign of the momentum needed to get a deal done in time. On Saturday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier demanded \u2018different proposals\u2019 from the UK saying that otherwise talks could not \u2018advance\u2019.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nMr Barclay suggested the UK could give ground on the details of the \u2018consent\u2019 mechanism for the Northern Ireland Assembly;\n\nOpposition MPs discussed installing John Bercow as interim Prime Minister to stop No Deal, it was reported.\n\nA poll put the Tories 15 points ahead of Labour \u2013 as a Jeremy Corbyn ally suggested there would be an election by the end of the year.\n\nThe Lib Dems agreed to a \u2018Remain Alliance Pact\u2019 in which they will not stand a candidate against leading anti-Brexit campaigner Dominic Grieve.\n\nThere was speculation Mr Johnson could try to sabotage the EU budget and send Nigel Farage to Brussels as a commissioner if he is forced to delay Brexit.\n\nFormer Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said she would not be standing for election again.\n\nAides also suggested Mr Johnson will refuse to quit No 10 if he loses a confidence vote even if MPs back another successor.\n\nToday, a Scottish court is expected to rule in a case brought by Remain campaigners which seeks to force Mr Johnson to show his hand on extension.\n\nIf they win, it could mean any attempt to avoid asking for a delay would leave Mr Johnson facing contempt of court proceedings.\n\nParliament will sit for two days this week and then is expected to prorogue before a Queen\u2019s Speech next Monday.\n\nBrussels officials have all but killed off the idea of getting a deal based on Mr Johnson\u2019s proposal done by next week\u2019s EU summit or by October 31.\n\nThey are expected to make an 11th hour offer of a time-limited Northern Ireland-only backstop that would keep it inside the customs union.
