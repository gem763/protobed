Sales of Nike's women apparel were up by double digits, as were sales of its famous Jordan sneakers. On a call with analysts, CEO Mark Parker said that digital sales grew 42% during the quarter.\n\nIn addition, the company saw improvement in its gross margins, which grew to 45.7% in the quarter. This prompted it to boost its forecast for the rest of the year, even as headwinds such as the threat of tariffs from the trade war mount. It now expects gross margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points, up from its previous expectations of a 50-basis-point expansion.\n\nThe earnings win came after a particularly rough fourth quarter for Nike, when it missed consensus earnings estimates for the first time in 27 quarters. But even though Nike's third-quarter results had also disappointed, analysts were still optimistic about the company.\n\nShares of Nike are up roughly 24% year-to-date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Nike shares climbed to a record high on Wednesday after reporting an earnings beat on Tuesday evening.
