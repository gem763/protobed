Cole Bennetts\n\nFormer Business Council of Australia president and prominent non-executive director Graham Bradley provided a good starting point for the basics of a good set of minutes in a discussion held by the AICD after the release of the joint statement.\n\n\u201cWhat I look for is a set of minutes that are clear and succinct, unambiguous, obviously accurate and factual, but also in plain English with as few acronyms as possible so that they are intelligible to a wider audience,\u201d Bradley said in a webinar.\n\nHe also acknowledged that there had been some recent tweaks around what good minutes look like, wryly noting that where once minutes were seen as a \u201cletter to an unknown judge\u201d, they were now a \u201cletter to an unknown royal commissioner\u201d.\n\nTo this end, there did need to be more detail to show how resolutions were arrived at, noting where and why directors questioned management, sought clarification and asked for more information, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s advisable to state some of the main considerations that the board considered in coming to its decision in more detail than [previously] you might have \u2013 not excessive detail, only essential detail,\u201d Bradley said.\n\n\u201cI think [minutes] need to be complete, but that doesn\u2019t mean they need to be excessively long. They need to have only the essential details to support the decisions.\u201d\n\nThe joint statement is specific that the votes of individual directors should not be recorded, except where there is an abstention or a dissent.\n\nBradley goes further, slapping directors who want to see their \u201cname in the minutes to show you\u2019re actually doing your job\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think the problem with quoting an individual director by name is that the poor old minute-taker will never get it absolutely accurate and you\u2019ll have a big debate about whether that was exactly what was said,\u201d he said.\n\nBradley said another important change in the past decade had been the addition of action lists that come out of each meeting. These could then be assessed by directors at the start of the next meeting.\n\n\u201cThat document can be more widely circulated to management as a checklist of what they need to do. Then there\u2019s a running record of things that are to be done, and what\u2019s happened to them.\u201d\n\nA fascinating question also addressed by the Governance Institute and the AICD is whether the legal privilege that attaches to confidential communications between lawyers and clients extends to board minutes. The message is that caution is needed.\n\n\u201cPrivilege is not usually lost by the board receiving the advice,\u201d the statement says. \u201cHowever, it is important to exercise caution and judgment in determining the degree of detail of privileged information (if any) that is necessary to include in the minutes.\u201d", "description": "The royal commission helped put the spotlight on what should and shouldn't be in board minutes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/11bebe0ab32749735234c721b7002d63790e99a0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
