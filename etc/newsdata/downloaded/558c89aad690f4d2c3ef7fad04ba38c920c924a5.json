And Farrow makes an airtight case against them with damning facts, damning evidence, the naming of names, and on-the-record sources.\n\nFarrow also targets President Trump, but his straight-forward approach only burnishes his credibility. Although Farrow is obviously no Trump fan and does believe the billionaire businessman worked with the National Enquirer to catch and kill embarrassing stories, Farrow also admits that some of those stories were caught and killed because they were not true. To his credit, Farrow reports that his search to find out the truth about a rape allegation against Trump proved to be fruitless, as did a bogus claim Trump fathered a child out of wedlock.\n\nI was mostly struck, though, by the snippets about Lisa Bloom. Maybe that\u2019s because all the bombshells about the men have already received a ton of attention with the book\u2019s release.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not only that\u2026\n\nAlthough she only pops up a few times, Bloom\u2019s behavior is so shocking to the conscience, these were the only sections I marked on the off-chance I would want to return to them. And here I am returning to them, because two weeks and one wicked cold later, I cannot get what she did out of my head.\n\nBy now, everyone who\u2019s followed the Weinstein story knows Bloom served as his attorney for a while, and that some of Weinstein\u2019s victims have credibly accused her of launching a disgusting campaign to destroy their credibility. What\u2019s more, during this same time, we discovered Bloom was in the employ of another credibly-accused sexual abuser, disgraced former Amazon Studios chief Roy Price.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m the one at Breitbart who extensively covered Bloom\u2019s connection to Price and Weinstein, so I already knew this going into Farrow\u2019s book and was still so stunned by her behavior I bookmarked those sections.\n\nBefore we get into it, let me be clear about a few things\u2026\n\nIf you believe in the rights of The Individual; if you believe, as I do, that the smallest and most vulnerable minority in the world is not blacks or transsexuals or gays, but The Individual, then you must also believe in the right of The Individual to hire an attorney to help him worm his way out of any jam, whether he\u2019s guilty as hell, or not.\n\nOne of the most important rights an individual has in this country is the right to hire an attorney who, no matter how sleazy or guilty the client may be, will fight to the death for that client. Furthermore, because we believe so strongly in that right, because there\u2019s a vital principle at stake, we should never condemn the attorneys who defend these clients \u2014 even the worst of the worst.\n\nCan you imagine living in a world where you can\u2019t find an attorney to defend you, where attorneys put aside the First Principle of the rights of the accused because of social stigma or peer pressure?\n\nLet me go even further by telling you how strongly I feel about this\u2026\n\nBecause I go on auto didactic jags in my free time, I have spent this past summer studying the O.J. Simpson murder trials (civil and criminal) \u2026 just because. Last summer it was the American gangsters of the 1930s, the summer before that it was Josef Stalin, the summer before that the Civil War. That\u2019s just how I roll.\n\nAnyway, the injustice and incompetence that occurred during O.J. Simpson\u2019s 1995 criminal trial, the fact that someone so obviously guilty of a double-slaughter \u2014 including the mother of his children, whose body he left for them to find just a few feet from where they slept \u2014 was allowed to walk free, is one of the most frustrating subjects I have ever examined. Honestly, I have probably read a dozen books on the subject, and did so the entire time with my stomach in a tight knot of anger and frustration.\n\nBut do you want to know who I am not angry with, who I admired throughout\u2026? Simpson\u2019s Dream Team, his attorneys: Johnnie Cochran, Robert Shapiro, Barry Scheck, F. Lee Bailey, Carl Douglas, Alan Dershowitz, Bob Kardashian. And do you want to know why? Because they did their job. They pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed, all within the limits of the law, to defend their client.\n\nThat\u2019s what attorneys are supposed to do.\n\nPeople are still furious over how Cochran so effectively used the race card to free a double murderer. To a point I agree. It is outrageous race was injected into a criminal trial that should have been tried only on facts and evidence. Nevertheless, it was Cochran\u2019s legal and moral duty to fight for every advantage, and it was that moron, Judge Lance Ito, who \u2014 with no basis in law \u2014 allowed Cochran that advantage. But had Cochran not pressed for that advantage (the only possible hope he had of winning Simpson\u2019s acquittal) and then not exploited that advantage to the hilt, he would have been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n\nIn fact, the only attorney who behaved unethically during the Simpson trial (unless you count the prosecution\u2019s jaw-dropping incompetence as unethical) is Robert Tourtelot, who stood before a group of reporters and threw his client Mark Fuhrman under the bus as a racist while he still represented him.\n\nTourtelot should have been disbarred.\n\nAnyway, God bless the late Johnnie Cochran and all those like him, who, right or wrong, fight to death for their clients.\n\nThat is my long way of saying that I am not disgusted with Lisa Bloom because she defended a pig like Harvey Weinstein, and I\u2019m not even disgusted with her attempts to discredit Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. Everything she did was within the limits of client advocacy, and there can be no justice in a country without such things, even though such things oftentimes result in something grotesque.\n\nNo, my thorough disgust with Bloom comes from her betrayal of that very principle and those ideals.\n\nTo begin with, like Cochran, Bloom has sold herself as what I call an \u201cissue attorney.\u201d Cochran\u2019s legal identity was based on his fight against racism in the Los Angeles Police Department. That was his issue. Gloria Allred (who just so happens to be Lisa Bloom\u2019s mother) is also an issue attorney. Her issue is to protect women abused by men. The Great Alan Dershowitz, who has driven me crazy (and taught me much) for decades, is an issue attorney, his issue is the overall principle of Constitutional Rights, which gives him the moral authority to defend everyone from O.J. Simpson to Bill Clinton to Donald Trump to Claus von Bulow.\n\nBloom has spent decades selling herself as an \u201cissue attorney,\u201d an advocate for women, a protector of women abused by the patriarchy. Her entire professional identity has been as a Mighty Legal Sword in Defense of Women. That\u2019s her issue, her stand, her principle, her North Star\u2026 And then, after decades and decades of ensuring America\u2019s women (and their advocates like Farrow) they would always have a champion in Lisa Bloom, this same Lisa Bloom, in secret!, switched sides. And she not only betrayed her personal and professional identity in the hopes Weinstein would adapt one of her books into a movie or miniseries, but according to Farrow, she used that betrayal as a means to intimidate and spy on Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims.\n\nImagine Johnnie Cochran defending a racist, rogue, white cop \u2026 for the MONEY.\n\nImagine Alan Dershowitz defending someone looking to overturn the Fourth Amendment \u2026 for the MONEY.\n\nWhat Bloom did was even worse, because she not only betrayed herself, her principles, her cause, and the trust of countless women \u2013 and did so in search of the Hollywood fame and fortune Weinstein could offer \u2013 she slithered around in SECRET.\n\nNot only did Bloom attempt to destroy Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims from the shadows, she used and abused her identity as a woman\u2019s advocate to get information on these women from Farrow, and did so by pretending she was still on the side of the angels; did so by straight up lying to Farrow about keeping his confidence and hiding from him the most important truth: that she was working for Weinstein.\n\nAccording to his book, over a few years, Bloom had sought to befriend Farrow and earn his trust. She spoke up about the credibility of Farrow\u2019s sister Dylan, who claims she was molested as a child by Woody Allen. She had even appeared on Farrow\u2019s MSNBC show, where she said of Bill Cobsy, \u201cI represent many victims of wealthy and successful predators. The first thing they do is go on the attack against the victim, try to dredge up anything they can find from her life to try and embarrass her.\u201d Farrow says Bloom spoke eloquently of how \u201cwomen are smeared, or they are threatened that they will be smeared.\u201d\n\nDuring a perilous time in his Weinstein reporting, when he felt he was being squeezed by NBC and Weinstein\u2019s non-disclosure agreements [NDAs] that threatened devastating legal action against any of the alleged victims who came forward, Farrow not only needed expert advice on the issue of powerful men intimidating their alleged victims, he needed someone he could trust completely.\n\nAnd so, naturally, he called Lisa Bloom.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re not under attorney-client privilege, but as a fellow lawyer I trust you,\u201d Farrow told Bloom during their first conversation. \u201cIf I ask you about a sensitive story, do you feel comfortable promising not to mention it to anyone until it comes out?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter he laid out his concerns about non-disclosure agreements, she told him she could be of more help if she knew who this was about.\n\n\u201cAnd you promise I have your word this will be kept in confidence?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cYou have my word,\u201d Bloom replied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\nThe next time they spoke, Bloom called him on a pretense that she quickly maneuvered back to pumping Farrow for information about his Weinstein investigation. She asked:\n\nBy the way, are you still working on that story about NDAs? Have you seen any of the non-disclosure agreements? How many women are you talking to? Can you tell me who they are? I may be able to help you get information if you can share who you\u2019re talking to.\n\nFarrow didn\u2019t name names, but he did tell Bloom there\u2019s a \u201cgroup and it\u2019s growing.\u201d\n\nBefore hanging up, Bloom promised to help Farrow find a way to shield these women from liability.\n\nThe next time she called, she again tried to pump him for information, this time by admitting she knew Weinstein and his attorney David Boies \u201ca little.\u201d\n\nAlarmed, Farrow said, \u201cLisa, you didn\u2019t mention this to anyone did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t!\u201d she replied. \u201cI just, you know, I had this idea I could help connect you to them.\u201d\n\nFarrow told her it was too early for that , but eventually he would reach out. \u201cJust please don\u2019t say anything,\u201d he begged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here if you need anything, okay?\u201d she said reassuringly. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d\n\nAnd then the bomb hit.\n\nFarrow discovered Bloom was not only working for Weinstein to discredit his victims, she was also part of the team that was secretly gathering information on who was talking to Farrow and what they were saying. Farrow writes of his final conversation with Bloom:\n\nThe last time I answered a call from Lisa Bloom that summer, I expressed astonishment. \u201cLisa, you swore as an attorney and a friend, that you wouldn\u2019t tell his people,\u201d I said. \u201cRonan,\u201d she replied. \u201cI am his people.\u201d\n\nSay what you want about Johnnie Cochran. He at least put on the uniform. He at least told the world I am here to defend this man. He did not abuse his friendship with Simpson prosecutor Chris Darden to secretly gather information by pretending he wanted to help.\n\nLisa Bloom\u2019s behavior \u2014 the bullying of vulnerable women, the betrayal, the lying \u2014 is among the sleaziest, most disgusting and unethical I have ever come across by any professional, not just an attorney. She\u2019s the Bernie Madoff of victims\u2019 advocates, the Lance Armstrong of the #MeToo Movement, and like them, she should be disgraced forever off the end of the earth.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
