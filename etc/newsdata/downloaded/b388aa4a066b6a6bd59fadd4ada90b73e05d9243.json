I cannot remember a good situation [he made] in attack,\" Hamann told Bild.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"If you have such a player in the team and he does not show any special moments, then, of course, you get problems because in the defence he only counts as half a player.\n\n\"He has 30 or 35 games left so he has to start sometime.\"\n\nHamann's comments come after Bayern boss Niko Kovac was forced to defend Coutinho after the 3-2 success in Greece.\n\n\"At the moment he lacks a little bit of luck,\" he said.\n\n\"He always has good actions. I am very satisfied with his performance as well as with the performance of the others.\"\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nMeanwhile, Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says there is no hurry for the club to make a decision on whether to sign Coutinho permanently.\n\n\"He doesn't have the attitude of a star. He's a friendly person, popular around the club and we're really happy with the deal we managed to close,\" he said.\n\n\"We will decide when the moment arrives.\"", "description": "Philippe Coutinho has managed two goals in his first 10 outings for Bayern since joining on loan from Barcelona", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Georgia Panagopoulou Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714211.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Olympiacos-FC-and-FCBayern-Munich-Piraeus-Greece-22-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
