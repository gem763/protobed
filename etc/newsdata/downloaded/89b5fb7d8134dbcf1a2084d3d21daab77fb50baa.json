In Buda, on the left bank of the river, lies romantic Castle Hill - home to the former Royal Palace - the Castle District, with its colourful street traders and musicians, and fascinating Matyas Church. Across the river, stylish Pest, with its sweeping boulevards, elegant stores, and the Belvaros (old town), is a hive of designer stores, smart coffee houses, patisseries and restaurants, many found along Vaci utca, the pedestrianised main shopping street.\n\n\n\nDon't miss the gloriously traditional and authentic Christmas Market that takes place on Vorosmarty ter - the central square. Here, over 100 wooden pavilions offer high quality hand-crafted gifts and artefacts, and the aromas of mulled wine, roasted chestnuts and traditional Hungarian pastries hang in the air. You'll also find another Christmas market in the square in front of St Stephen's Basilica, onto the dome of which a festive laser show is projected as night falls.\n\n\n\nTake the opportunity to join the optional festive river cruise past the glorious parliament building, and, this evening, perhaps dine in one of the many restaurants in the Belvaros.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://holidays.theguardian.com/tourimg.php?a=img&img=b738779de74b694a49ea21276e0bbf4b"}
