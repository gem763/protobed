But where such enviable talent creates an aura of mystique, it also inevitably arouses curiosity. When former US Senator Claire McCaskill asked Buttigieg to comment on his language-speaking ability in a 14 February instalment of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, he replied: \u201cit depends what you mean by speak!\u201d and added that he can \u201cstill kind of read a newspaper in Norwegian\u2026 but only slowly\u201d and that he has gotten \u201crusty\u201d in his Arabic and Dari. That shows humility, but not so much that Buttigieg and his camp definitively dismiss the polyglot rumours.\n\nThis is not to deride Mayor Buttigieg. His perceived fluency interests me because I\u2019m a former language teacher \u2013 having taught English for 11 years in Japan and Italy \u2013 and I am also a Cambridge English exam speaking examiner; a role which requires me to dissect variables in candidates\u2019 second language production such as pronunciation, discourse management, and grammatical range. Buttigieg is clearly fascinated by languages, willing to learn, and is brave enough to practice with native speakers on television \u2013 qualities that would have made him the star of my classroom. But \u2013 like so many of my ex-students who expected to go from \u201cbeginner\u201d to \u201cnative\u201d proficiency in two months \u2013 Buttigieg may have underestimated what it means to \u201cspeak\u201d a language.\n\nI can relate all too well to overestimating one\u2019s own abilities. A \u201cheritage speaker\u201d of Italian, I\u2019d been living in Italy for two years when I overheard a receptionist refer me to me as \u201cthat foreigner who doesn\u2019t speak Italian\u201d. I was confused, then gutted. That one casual sentence launched a journey that resulted in my being forced to acknowledge that while I had grown up speaking Italian at home and was fluent, I was not by any means proficient.\n\nWhat does the word \u201cfluent\u201d actually mean? In lay circles, this term has come to equal \"native-level proficient\", with no grey area between the bumbling beginner and the mellifluous master. An outsider overhearing a conversation in a foreign language only hears a fog of sounds, thus perceiving anyone who can cobble together a sentence as \u201cfluent\u201d.\n\nBut Daniel Morgan, head of learning development at the Shenker Institutes of English \u2013 a popular chain of English schools in Italy \u2013 says that fluency actually refers to how \u201csmoothly\u201d and \u201cefficiently\u201d a second language (L2) speaker can speak on \u201ca range of topics in real time\u201d. While fluency may denote a degree of proficiency, it does not automatically imply accuracy \u2013 the ability to produce grammatically correct sentences \u2013 nor does it imply grammatical range.\n\nHow important are accuracy and grammatical range? That depends on the speaker\u2019s needs. If they simply wish to converse in social settings, their focus may be solely on achieving fluency, but if the L2 is required for business or academia, accuracy and range are crucial as communications full of errors may be seen as unprofessional.\n\nThese errors can include literal word-for-word translation from their native language (\u201cI go in Spain\u201d), and language switch (\u201cI want eat ringo\u201d). Bungled verb tenses, prepositions, plurals, and articles are a natural, even essential, part of the learning process.\n\nYou might also enjoy:\n\nMany learners, however, fall into the trap of assuming that because they are understood, their speech is \u201cperfect\u201d. And it isn\u2019t only the speaker who glosses over mistakes; in the Handbook of Second Language Assessment, Nivja de Jong \u2013 senior lecturer at the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics \u2013 argues that grammatical errors usually won\u2019t prevent comprehension on the part of the listener, who is automatically able to \u201cedit out\u201d mistakes. In English, a sentence like \u201cI have 17 years\u201d is incorrect, yet one nonetheless understands that the speaker wants to say that he is 17 years old. Furthermore, friends and teachers tend to encourage L2 learners rather than discourage them, which may also contribute to inflated self-assessment.\n\nI think of the popular memes comparing how we envision a story or scene in our head, to the way we tell it or paint it. Those first crucial years of learning a language, you may be thinking in glorious brush strokes but speaking in scribbles.\n\nSo when can someone say they \u201cspeak\u201d a language? That\u2019s the million-dollar question. Can someone consider themselves a Spanish speaker if they\u2019re conversational but often can\u2019t understand native speakers because they \u201ctalk too fast\u201d? If they use only two verb tenses and every sentence contains mistakes?\n\nThe answer may be less \u201cyes/no\u201d and more \u201chow well?\u201d\n\nLuckily, scales for measuring spoken fluency and overall proficiency exist. \u201cFluency is an abstract concept, so we assign observable variables,\u201d explains Daniel Morgan. Two of the most reliable factors are \u201cspeech rate\u201d and \u201cutterance length\u201d. Speech rate can be defined as how much (effective) language you\u2019re producing over time, for example how many syllables per minute. Utterance length is, as an average, how much you can produce between disfluencies (e.g. a pause or hesitation). You could look at accuracy as being subsumed into fluency, in terms of grammatical accuracy, lexical choice, pronunciation, and precision.\u201d\n\nPauses are important: \u201cfilled\u201d pauses \u2013 such as \u201cum\u201d in English \u2013 are more frequent in less fluent speakers, whereas a speaker whose pauses are rare and \u201cunfilled\u201d (e.g, thoughtful pauses) is more fluent. Likewise, slower speakers who only utter brief phrases are deemed less fluent than quicker speakers who can formulate lengthy blocks of speech. De Jong describes the unconscious process any speaker goes through before speaking: conceptualising what to say, formulating how to say it, and, finally, articulating the appropriate sounds. All of this takes place in roughly six syllables per second. A speaker of a second language who needs to convert their thoughts into an unfamiliar language faces an even greater challenge in meeting these strict time constraints. They must also often overcome inhibition and pronunciation challenges. Accuracy may still be lacking at this stage, but make no mistake \u2013 achieving L2 fluency is a colossal feat.\n\nThe Council of Europe\u2019s Common European Framework of References (CEFR) for Languages groups language learners into concrete proficiency levels, where fluency and accuracy are just two of many examined criteria. The CEFR \u2013 available in 40 languages \u2013 divides proficiency into six \u201ccan do\u201d levels \u2013 A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. A corresponds to \u201cBasic\u201d levels, B to \u201cIndependent\u201d, and C to \u201cProficient.\u201d Observable skills include:\n\nA1: Capabilities range include basic introductions and answering questions about personal details provided the listener speaks slowly and is willing to cooperate.\n\nA2: Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her past, environment and matters related to his/her immediate needs and perform routine tasks requiring basic exchanges of information.\n\nB1: Can deal with most daily life situations in the country where the language is spoken. Can describe experiences, dreams and ambitions and give brief reasons for opinions and goals.\n\nB2: Can understand the themes of complex texts on both concrete and abstract topics and will have achieved a degree of fluency and spontaneity, which makes interaction with native speakers possible without significant strain for either party.\n\nC1: Can understand a wide range of longer texts and recognise subtleties and implicit meaning; producing clear, well-structured and detailed text on complex subjects, showing controlled use of organisational patterns, connectors and cohesive devices.\n\nC2: Can understand virtually everything heard or read, expressing themselves spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, while differentiating finer shades of meaning even in highly complex situations.\n\nGeraint Thomas, a Cambridge English speaking exam team leader, explains: \u201cWe look at things like cohesion, response rate, discourse management, and pronunciation, but each variable has sub-variables. You can break pronunciation down into stress and individual sounds.\u201d He emphasises that the progression is gradual. \u201cYou can expect a good B2 candidate to have certain things under control; the present tense, maybe. However, they might not have their second conditional, and you\u2019re aware that this is a progressive thing.\u201d\n\nThomas adds that individual second language speakers can display different strengths: \u201cYou can get students who are very accurate but so afraid of making mistakes that their fluency suffers and others who throw themselves into something, who are quite fluent, but their language is full of mistakes.\u201d\n\nAccording to research from the University of Cambridge English Language Assessment, it takes 200 guided hours for a motivated learner to advance from one level to the next. Key word, motivated: language acquisition varies dramatically between individuals. Is the learner open to new structures? Will they build upon what they\u2019ve already learned instead of clinging to basic \u201cgood enough\u201d grammar? Will they commit to consistent study and practice? Bottom line: there are many steps between \u201cThe pen is on the table\u201d and penning a perfect thesis on a piece of literature.\n\nProficiency scales provide an excellent gauge for assessing L2 ability, but I believe that the quickest, dirtiest fluency and accuracy \u201ctests\u201d are real-life situations with native speakers. How smooth and lengthy are your interactions in your L2? Do you avoid or \u201cblank\u201d at certain topics and situations because you don\u2019t have the words? Do you find yourself grasping for \u201ckey words\u201d and content yourself with understanding \u201cthe sense\u201d rather than the entirety of the conversation? How well can you understand a film without subtitles or read a book without a dictionary? If you write an email and ask a native speaker to proofread it, how many errors will they find?\n\nAs for me, while my Italian grammatical range has improved dramatically in my nine years in Italy, as a writer I yearn for flawless, native-like accuracy and syntax. I\u2019m not there yet, and there are many days where I despair that I never will be.\n\nAnd then I remind myself that learning a second language is like entering into a marriage. You think you know your partner when you put the ring on their finger, but it\u2019s only the beginning, and the commitment is for life.\n\n--\n\nEva Sandoval is an Italian-American writer who has been based in Italy since 2010.
