The convicted felon donated to prominent charities, convinced friends to invite him to A-list events, and took to wearing a Harvard sweatshirt whenever there was a camera around. But among the most important stops on Epstein\u2019s comeback tour were his regular appointments at hairdresser Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai\u2019s high-profile salons.\n\nMultiple former Fekkai employees told The Daily Beast that Epstein regularly brought groups of young women into the New York salon after his conviction, where he paid for their services and had them sit on his lap and stroke his hair. When he was in Florida, former employees said, Epstein would have Fekkai stylists make house calls to his Palm Beach estate.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Fekkai\u2019s brand had received an influx of cash years earlier from a company backed by L Brands\u2014the same retailer owned by Epstein\u2019s only known client, Les Wexner.\n\nA spokesperson for Frederic Fekkai brands said the company had been sold by the time of Epstein\u2019s conviction in 2008, and that Fekkai was not involved in the salons at the time.\n\n\u201cNeither he, nor the current management team, had any knowledge of the incidents described and, in Mr. Fekkai\u2019s limited acquaintance with Mr. Epstein, he never witnessed any of the deplorable conduct that led to Mr. Epstein\u2019s conviction,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nTwo decades ago, Epstein would have been almost indistinguishable from the dozens of celebrity clients who flocked to Fekkai\u2019s Upper East Side salon. Fekkai, a charismatic coiffeur known for his boyish good looks, opened his first salon in 1988 and rose quickly from an unknown French hairdresser to a stylist to the stars. He styled celebrities like Demi Moore, Jodi Foster, and Meryl Streep for the red carpet, and was credited with giving Hillary Clinton her signature short, layered \u2018do.\n\nA 2005 New York Times article listed cuts at Fekkai\u2019s salon\u2014which could run up to $750 apiece\u2014as one of many upsides for Epstein\u2019s personal assistants. \u201cIn addition to the rich payday, he also ladles on the perks,\u201d the article said of the financier. \u201cHe maintains a charge account at Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai, the society hair dresser, for their unlimited use and pays for all food eaten during his lengthy business hours, including takeout from Le Cirque.\u201d\n\nBut Fekkai and Epstein appeared to be closer than just stylist and client. The financier had 16 numbers for Fekkai in his black book of contacts, including the hairdresser\u2019s home number, his French cell phone, and a number for his assistant. Flight logs show Fekkai flew on Epstein\u2019s private plane at least twice, along with Epstein\u2019s alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell and his shady model-scout pal Jean-Luc Brunel.\n\nSimone Banos, a longtime friend of Fekkai, told The Daily Beast that Epstein and Fekkai ran in similar New York social circles, but said she couldn\u2019t imagine the hairdresser staying friends with Epstein after he was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and accused by dozens more of sexual assault.\n\nBut four former Fekkai employees said Epstein remained a regular at the salon, even after his 2008 conviction. Three of these employees recalled Epstein bringing a rotating cast of tall, beautiful, and suspiciously young-looking women with him for monthly appointments. (The fourth employee remembered Epstein bringing women in with him, but could not recall details of their interactions.)\n\nThe financier paid for the women\u2019s haircuts and dye jobs from his house account, the employees said, and either he or a female associate dictated exactly how their hair was styled. In between services, the women sat on Epstein\u2019s lap or stroked his hair\u2014in full view of the hundreds of guests at Fekkai\u2019s 9,000-square-foot hair emporium. \u201cIt was very out in the open,\u201d one former employee said. \u201cEveryone knew.\"\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give an eff,\" another former employee said. \"He was coming in like he was running the show. He didn\u2019t care.\"\n\n\u201c He didn\u2019t give an eff. He was coming in like he was running the show. He didn\u2019t care. \u201d\n\nSeveral employees told The Daily Beast they asked not to work with Epstein or the women he brought in after his conviction. But they also said they did not want to complain too much, because it was clear Epstein was friendly with Fekkai, and because they could not tell if something illegal was going on.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, we could never tell how old the girls were,\u201d one former employee said. \u201cThey came in heels, makeup \u2026 They were all way too young for him, but legal? You didn\u2019t always know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he was a pig no matter what,\u201d the employee added.\n\nIn Palm Beach, the ritzy vacation town where Epstein was first charged, Fekkai employees said stylists made regular house calls to the financier\u2014in the same $2.5 million estate where he spent his yearlong house arrest. One stylist said he was first introduced to Epstein by Fekkai himself, at the New York salon, and started cutting Epstein\u2019s hair at his Palm Beach home in 2012. Three current and former co-workers confirmed that they had heard the stylist talk about these trips.\n\nThe stylist said he often spoke with Sarah Kellen and Lesley Groff\u2014two of Epstein\u2019s assistants who have been accused of recruiting girls for his sexual massages\u2014but never saw anything that aroused his suspicions.\u201cAny girls that I saw that were there, I always found them very educated ... Very smart, very articulate,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cWhen I was there for the hour, hour and a half, he was a gentleman.\u201d\n\nA Fekkai Brands spokesperson said the company completed an exhaustive review of its records and found no receipts for house calls to Epstein\u2019s residences.\n\n\u201cIf a stylist did make a house call to one of his homes, he or she did not do so as an employee of the company,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201c Any girls that I saw that were there, I always found them very educated ... Very smart, very articulate. \u201d\n\nWhat the stylists did not know was the extent of their boss\u2019 financial relationship with Les Wexner\u2014Epstein\u2019s only known client. Wexner is the CEO of L Brands, which owns companies like Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and C.O. Bigelow. He first hired Epstein as his personal financial advisor, but eventually handed over an uncommon amount of money and power to the relatively unknown money man.\n\nAmong other things, Wexner gave Epstein full power of attorney, and reportedly donated more than $10 million to Epstein\u2019s charity through his personal foundation. Several of Epstein\u2019s accusers have claimed the financier posed as a Victoria\u2019s Secret talent scout in order to lure them into hotel rooms and assault them. (Wexner claims he had no personal knowledge of Epstein\u2019s impropriety, and cut ties with him in 2007 when the allegations against him emerged.)\n\nFekkai first entered Wexner\u2019s orbit in 2004, when Bath & Body Works and C.O. Bigelow began selling his line of home haircare products, which had until then been sold only in high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus. One former Fekkai executive told The Daily Beast that she advised against the deal, thinking it would diminish the brand\u2019s status, but that Fekkai was set on it.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened if Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric wasn\u2019t behind it, and of that I\u2019m certain,\u201d the executive said.\n\nThe following year, private equity company Catterton Partners issued a celebratory press release announcing it had taken a majority stake in Frederic Fekkai, Inc. What the press release did not mention was that Catterton was backed, in part, by L Brands. In fact, both the L Brands executive and a former Fekkai executive said Wexner had considered buying the hair products company outright.\n\n\u201cL Brands did not have a direct investment but did participate in a private equity fund which had stakes in a number of companies, including a controlling interest in Fekkai,\u201d a spokesperson for Fekkai Brands told The Daily Beast.\n\nL Brands never wound up buying Fekkai\u2019s company. Instead, the company was purchased in 2005 by Procter & Gamble for a reported $440 million. The company\u2014known for producing drugstore standbys like Pantene and Herbal Essences\u2014tried and failed to introduce Fekkai\u2019s product line to a mass-market audience, dropping its price point as well as its prestige.\n\nP&G eventually sold the company to Designer Parfums and Luxe Brands at an estimated $390 million loss. A lawsuit filed by Fekkai employees this year claimed Luxe Brands had mismanaged the company and degraded the brand, turning its flagship location into a \u201cmall salon\u201d that \u201cdoes not offer the same luxurious environment that the clients had grown accustomed to.\u201d\n\n\u201cFekkai's three changes of ownership in ten years, and two changes of ownership in only three years, among other things, have made it difficult for Plaintiffs to feel comfortable having a long-term future at Fekkai,\u201d the plaintiffs wrote. (The lawsuit was settled out of court.)\n\nLast winter, Fekkai bought his company back from Designer Parfums and Luxe Brands for an undisclosed sum\u2014something he had reportedly been hoping to do for some time. In an interview with Women\u2019s Wear Daily, Fekkai said he was eager to be in the driver\u2019s seat, and expand his brand internationally and online.\n\n\"The brand needs a leader,\" he said, \"someone who knows what they're doing, who the team can respect.\u201d", "description": "Even after his jail stint, Jeffrey Epstein frequented his friend Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai\u2019s high-profile salons with a bevy of very young women, former stylists say.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570404760/191006-shugerman-fekkai-epstein-tease_t4qaoy", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
