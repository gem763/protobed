But this wasn\u2019t a normal ride.\n\nRoss, author of the lifestyle blog Ask Away, was driving her 9-year-old dog to the veterinary specialist\u2019s office in September 2016 after noticing that even the slightest touch to her neck would cause her to yelp in pain - and cause Ross\u2019 heart to shatter. She wanted answers and agreed to an MRI. All told, the bill for diagnosis came to $6,500, which she decided to \u201cfigure out\u201d later.\n\n\u201cI was willing to do whatever it took,\u201d Ross, 33, says. That included turning to emergency funds, a personal credit card and a financing offer via a second card offered at the specialist\u2019s office. It also involved a crowdfunding campaign Ross started while sitting in the specialist\u2019s parking lot.\n\nWhen pets get sick, expenses pile up quickly. If you encounter a sky-high vet bill, it\u2019s important to have a plan for dealing with it while keeping debt under control.\n\nFINANCING OPTIONS AND DISCOUNTS\n\nPet insurance - or even an emergency fund like Ross had - can be helpful before issues arise. But not every pet or condition is eligible for coverage, and not every owner can afford to earmark savings for pet medical bills.\n\nAnd by the time you\u2019re at the emergency clinic, it\u2019s too late to consider insurance. But there are other resources.\n\n- Get a 0% introductory APR credit card . If your pet\u2019s condition isn\u2019t urgent and you have a good credit score (690 or higher), you may qualify for a card that can help you finance your vet bill at 0% interest over a long period. Some cards even offer a sign-up bonus that can defray a vet bill.\n\nVet offices may also offer access to deferred-interest promotions; Ross used one for part of her bill. But unlike true 0% APR cards, these offers require you to pay off the entire balance within the promotional window, or you\u2019ll incur interest for the full transaction retroactively.\n\n\u201cThese cards are considered a risk because any sort of setback that leaves you unable to pay off the full balance \u2026 is going to result in a big bill, when the whole point of the card was to pay less,\u201d says Martin Lynch, director of education at Cambridge Credit Counseling.\n\nRoss notes she understood the terms and paid off that balance within the promo period.\n\n- Ask your vet for help. Some vets may be willing to work with clients on installment plans or offer in-house financial assistance programs.\n\n\u201cHere at my hospital, for example, we have a number of financial assistance programs all designated for different pets, different clients, different situations,\u201d says Gary Block, a veterinarian in Rhode Island and spokesperson for the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n- Look to nonprofits. The Humane Society\u2019s website lists resources by state that provide low-cost services or grants for veterinary services. Organizations may require tax forms, bank statements or pay stubs.\n\n- Consider an accredited veterinary school\u2019s clinic. Vet school clinics can be more affordable, though finding one might require research. A good place to start is the American Veterinary Medical Association\u2019s website.\n\n- Crowdfund. A couple of months after launching her GoFundMe campaign for Grace and sharing it on social media, Ross says she raised $5,327 to put toward the debt. She paid it off about two months later.\n\nMAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOUR PET\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to align your heart and head when making medical decisions for a pet, Block says. He suggests considering the prognosis, likelihood of the procedure\u2019s success, present and future costs, long-term complications, financial circumstances, your pet\u2019s age and their relationship to the household.\n\n\u201cFor me and most clients, the issue is whether short-term pain will potentially result in a long-term improvement in quality and quantity of life,\u201d Block says. \u201cAdding days or weeks to a pet\u2019s life without quality of life is not fair to the animal.\u201d\n\nFor Ross, it was worth the MRI cost to learn that Grace has intervertebral disc disease - the discs between her vertebrae press on the nerves running through her spinal cord and cause pain. Surgery was a risky, expensive option.\n\nA second opinion from Ross\u2019 longtime vet led her to choose pain management.\n\n\u201cGrace is doing a lot better because we just get her pain medication,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt only flares up twice a year.\u201d\n\nOutside of those episodes, Grace lives for her walks, car rides and duets with Ross.\n\n___\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.
