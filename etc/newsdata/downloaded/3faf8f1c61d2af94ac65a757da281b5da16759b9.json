(Moeketsi Mamane)\n\nA man has opened a case against Mountain Rise police officers who were off-duty when they allegedly raided his home and beat him until he was unconscious.\n\nNorthdale resident Sarven Naicker said the attack left him with head injuries, cracked ribs as well as broken blood vessels in his eyes.\n\nNaicker said that on Wednesday night he had an argument with his wife who left the house to go see a friend just before 7 pm.\n\n\u201cI was alone at the house when two policemen came into my house. They were off-duty and brought two other people with them who are not police officers.\n\n\u201cWhen they came in, they were talking to me nicely and one of the officers showed me his appointment card.\n\n\u201cHe was not in a police vehicle.\n\n\u201cAfter talking for a bit, he slapped me in the face. He slapped me again and then shoved the door open, dragged me outside and started beating me. I was screaming for them to stop and talk to me but they just carried on.\n\n\u201cI heard one of the people begging the officers to stop. He said to them, \u2018stop it, you are going to kill him\u2019. I then lost consciousness and was left outside my house for dead.\u201d\n\nHe said he had put R1 000 for his rent under his Bible on the counter but when he went to get it to pay his rent the next day, he saw that it was gone and he believes the officers might have taken it.\n\nNaicker said the officers threatened to kill him if he opened a case against them, however, Naicker went to open his case on Thursday morning.\n\nA family friend of Naicker\u2019s, who works closely with the law and asked not to be named for professional reasons, said no one had called radio control to send out the officers and that they came of their own accord after a relative of Naicker\u2019s phoned him.\n\nNaicker said he and the relative concerned did not get on at all and that he believes the man is friends with the police officers who came to his home.\n\nThe family friend said there was no complaint registered with radio control and no incident reference numbers, which police should have when attending to a scene.\n\n\u201cThey have abused their power as police officers and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) will be contacted about this. We are also wanting to open a civil case and take legal action against the officers,\u201d said the friend.\n\nNaicker said he was afraid for his life and feared returning home in case the officers came back to his house.\n\n\u201cI am terrified. I am staying with a friend because I had to leave my house.\u201d\n\nNaicker has been to the district surgeon and is expected to go for more X-rays and scans following the attack.", "description": "A man has opened a case against Mountain Rise police officers who were off-duty when they allegedly raided his home and beat him until he was unconscious.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7596/09afbb5368ff413383d3dc18ad5eca28.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
