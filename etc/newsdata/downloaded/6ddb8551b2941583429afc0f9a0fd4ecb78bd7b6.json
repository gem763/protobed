A friend of Epstein said the financier 'sorted' a meeting between Lord Mandelson \u2013 whom he called 'Petie' \u2013 and Jamie Dimon, the billionaire chairman of US investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nLord Mandelson asked Epstein \u2013 who was then on day release \u2013 to arrange a meeting with a billionaire New York banker. Channel 4's Dispatches allege Epstein agreed instantly\n\nAt the time, Epstein, who killed himself in August, was serving an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to procuring a 14-year-old girl for prostitution.\n\nThe financier's friend, who requested anonymity, said: 'I was astonished that a British Cabinet Minister... probably the most powerful man other than the Prime Minister, was calling Jeffrey in jail to make an appointment... with a very powerful banker in New York.'\n\nIn The Prince And The Paedophile, to be broadcast at 10pm tomorrow, Dispatches also explores Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew and claims the men met at least ten times. Epstein is pictured above\n\nIn 2005 Lord Mandelson was photographed shopping with Epstein in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nHe also featured in the financier's 'little black book' of contacts encompassing every sphere of influence, from politics to royalty.\n\nLord Mandelson's entry included ten numbers, including home numbers and mobile details for his partner.\n\nThe friend, who has never spoken before, said the exchange with the politician 'demonstrated that as far as Jeffrey was concerned... life was carrying on as if nothing had happened'.\n\nAsked if the phone call had worked, the friend replied: 'Yep, it was sorted out.'\n\nHe added: 'You don't call Peter Mandelson 'Petie' if you're not a close friend.'\n\nLawyers for Lord Mandelson said he 'has no recollection of a telephone conversation with Mr Epstein in January 2009... in which he allegedly requested Mr Epstein set up a meeting with Jamie Dimon'.\n\nThey added: 'Our client would have no need to make such a request... As Business Secretary... he met or talked on the phone to bank CEOs on a regular basis, including Mr Dimon.'\n\nCourt documents show Epstein unsuccessfully applied to a judge in late 2009 to leave his Florida home, where he was under house arrest, for a meeting in New York with an unnamed British Minister to discuss British universities.\n\nThe Minister was described as an 'under-secretary to the Prime Minister of Great Britain'.\n\nLord Mandelson has denied being the Minister and his spokesman said he was in London during those dates.\n\nIn The Prince And The Paedophile, to be broadcast at 10pm tomorrow, Dispatches also explores Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew and claims the men met at least ten times.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said 'any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue'.", "description": "As de facto Deputy Prime Minister to Gordon Brown in 2009, Lord Mandelson asked Epstein - who was then on day release - to arrange a meeting with a billionaire New York banker.", "authors": ["Ian Gallagher For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937310-0-image-a-8_1571518851306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
