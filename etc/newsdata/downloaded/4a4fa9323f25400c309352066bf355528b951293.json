Since 2014, the Kurds have fought alongside the U.S. in defeating the Islamic State in Syria, and Trump's move was decried at home and abroad as a betrayal of an ally.\n\nOver the past five days, Turkish troops and their allies have pushed their way into northern towns and villages, clashing with the Kurdish fighters over a stretch of 200 kilometers (125 miles). The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people.\n\nOn Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said all American troops will withdraw from northern Syria because of the increasing danger of getting caught in the crossfire.\n\n\"We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it's a very untenable situation,\" he said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" He did not say how many would withdraw or where they would go but that they represent most of the 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria.\n\nThe peril to American forces was illustrated on Friday, when a small number of U.S. troops came under Turkish artillery fire at an observation post in the north. No Americans were hurt. Esper said it was unclear whether that was an accident.\n\nTrump, in a tweet, said: \"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made.\"", "description": "Syria's Kurds said Syrian government forces agreed Sunday to help them fend off Turkey's invasion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104391224-GettyImages-509763032.jpg?v=1536266653", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
