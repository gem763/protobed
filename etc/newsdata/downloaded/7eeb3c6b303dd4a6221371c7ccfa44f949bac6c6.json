Owner Debbie Bond was forced to break it with a hammer after fearing for her dog's safety\n\nDebbie rushed Charlie to Abbey Green Vets to be checked over and have the final portion of the urn removed from around his neck.\n\nHilarious photos show the dog, dubbed 'Cheeky Charlie', gazing mournfully and flashing puppy-dog eyes from his giant, heavy accidental collar.\n\nDebbie rushed Charlie to Abbey Green Vets to be checked over and have the final portion of the urn removed from around his neck\n\nLuckily the vet was able to sedate Charlie and 'de-pot' the puppy, and once he recovered from his mischief the little dog was back to his inquisitive ways within a day.\n\nDebbie, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, said: 'It was quite a dangerous situation actually, because he's only a few weeks old.\n\n'I was on the patio, eating my breakfast quite late on a Monday morning. It's quite a small patio with a few pots around, and this pot was like an urn that my mum bought me.\n\n'I heard this terrible noise of him screaming and turned around, rushed over and tried to pull his head out, but it was so stuck that I knew he would suffocate if I didn't do something quickly.\n\n'So I just ran in the house with him in my arms and the pot which was really heavy. I got a hammer and smashed it all around.\n\n'I hoped I didn't hit his head obviously, but I knew I didn't have much choice as we didn't have long.\n\n'I took him to the vets and as soon as I knew he would be alright, I asked the vet if we could take a photo.\n\n'They just stick their heads in anything and try and chew anything. They try and chew the terracotta or enamel pots or anything. He was literally four feet away from me.\n\n'I was sitting on the bench and both of them were playing four feet away. He wasn't even out of sight'. Pictured: Charlie sits next to the pot he got his head stuck in\n\n'Now I know he's alright I think it's quite funny but at the time it wasn't.. That pot is really heavy and thick, and it's a lovely pot. It's hard to smash because it was a good centimetre and a half thick'\n\n'I was sitting on the bench and both of them were playing four feet away. He wasn't even out of sight.\n\n'He's absolutely fine now. He was very quiet for a day because he's very confident. He was very quiet the next day but now he's back to normal.\n\n'Before I leave the house I check everything three times to make sure everything is safe when I leave.\n\n'I think he must have nine lives because he's also chewed the cable lamp while it was on. I call him \"Cheeky Charlie\".\n\n'I think he must have nine lives because he's also chewed the cable lamp while it was on.

It's hard to smash because it was a good centimetre and a half thick.\n\n'It probably weighs more than he does, and I was worried about breaking his neck if I pulled too hard, which is why I took him straight to the vets.'\n\nSarah Jones, a veterinary nurse at Abbey Green Vets, said: 'Charlie certainly brightened up our Monday morning.\n\n'It's not something we've seen before here at Abbey Green, although it's common for puppies to visit us who have been up to other forms of mischief at this inquisitive age.\n\n'Luckily for Charlie, all it took was a light sedation for the vet to free him from the pot.'\n\nIn a post, Abbey Green Vets wrote: 'This curious little guy got more than he bargained for today when he decided to investigate a plant pot in his owners garden [sic].\n\n'A light sedation and gentle persuasion from the vet saw him free of his unfortunate DIY cone of shame, and he was back home in no time. (hopefully not up to anymore mischief).'", "description": "Debbie Bond, 58, from Cheltenham said she found Collie and Springer Spaniel cross puppy Charlie 'screaming in terror' after getting a large terracotta pot stuck over his head.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447146-0-image-a-3_1570545654779.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
