Sanford lost that race 47 percent to Arrington\u2019s 50 percent.\n\nThis was framed by many as yet another example of an anti-Trump Republican being tossed out by his own party. And while that was what happened, it was also something else: a cautionary example of the potential limits of Trumpism even in red districts\u2014as shown when Democrat Joe Cunningham defeated Arrington in the general election.\n\nIt was the first time a Democrat had won that seat in over three decades. Yet there\u2019s good reason for Republicans to believe they can win it back in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Carolina State Representative Nancy Mace is currently running against Cunningham. Mace is a former Sanford supporter who also worked for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Before stumping for Trump, she backed Rand Paul for president early in 2016 and also supported his father Ron Paul\u2019s White House bid in 2012.\n\nShe is one of four Republicans to have entered the race to challenge Cunningham, and is the current frontrunner by a significant margin. On October 14, Charleston\u2019s Post & Courier reported that Mace had outpaced her opponents significantly in fundraising, raising over a half million since her June launch (the second highest Republican fundraiser only brought in $90,000 over the same period). An October poll conducted by the Columbia-based consulting firm First Tuesday Strategies put Mace at 19 percent and the other three GOP competitors at about 3 percent each.\n\nThough many Republican voters remain undecided\u201460 percent of them, according to the poll\u2014it\u2019s not surprising that Mace so far has the most appeal.\n\nThis begins with her opposition to offshore drilling. While Trump, the Sanford-defeating Arrington, and most in the GOP nationally might support the practice, many Republican voters in Mace\u2019s district do not, particularly those who live on the South Carolina shoreline. Sanford also opposed drilling, as does his Democratic successor Cunningham.\n\nDays before announcing her campaign, Mace penned an op-ed for USA Today declaring, \u201cI support Trump but not offshore oil drilling.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats \u201cneed that single issue to define the race,\u201d Mace told The American Conservative in a phone interview. \u201cMe jumping into the race, I take that single issue off the table.\u201d\n\nFew also have a better backstory and appealing mix of pro-Trump and independent positions than Mace.\n\nThe 42-year-old mother is known to many in the South Carolina Lowcountry as the first woman to graduate from The Citadel military college in Charleston. She ran for U.S. Senate in 2014 as a libertarian-leaning Republican, challenging unrepentant hawk Senator Lindsey Graham in the GOP primary, and received 6 percent in a field of six candidates.\n\nSome believe that one of the reasons Cunningham won in 2018 was due to an influx of Democratic voters. Mace dismisses this. \u201cThe district is not turning blue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be turning purple, because there are more independents down here, but by and large this is a Republican district.\u201d\n\nI was born and raised in South Carolina\u2019s First District, and agree with Mace\u2019s assessment. In full disclosure, I have also known Mace personally for about a decade.\n\nMace understands the importance of the Trump factor in her race.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump played a big role in the Republican primary last year,\u201d Mace said. \u201cSanford and others who were not at all supportive of the president on any issue or any particular policy, not a single one, those folks lost their primaries or lost their elections last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks down here know I worked for President Trump and helped get him elected,\u201d Mace said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a blank check, right?\u201d\n\nI asked Mace about whether she, as a constitutionalist, could agree with the entirety of Trump\u2019s agenda, and about Sanford\u2019s hostile approach to the president as opposed to the more amiable tack taken by Senator Rand Paul.\n\n\u201cSenator Paul has done an amazing job supporting the president,\u201d Mace said. \u201cBut also in showing that his ideology, where it aligns, it\u2019s appropriate, and where it doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s got a voice on those issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Senator Paul, he understands that and where the president is coming from,\u201d Mace said. \u201cBut also when he differs with him or the administration, he\u2019s very respectful about how he does it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s rare in what we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s politics, on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Mace added. \u201cI think having a pragmatic approach to liberty issues is the only way to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\nMace is a strong Second Amendment supporter, pro-life advocate (she sponsored a six-week fetal heartbeat bill), and staunch defender of civil liberties, including opposing mass surveillance.\n\nI \u201ccan\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this debate,\u201d Mace exclaimed. Government \u201cspying on citizens without a warrant or warrant process? Our Bill of Rights and Constitution are not negotiable. It\u2019s not a living document. These are rights that are guaranteed to every American citizen.\u201d\n\nOn illegal immigration, Mace favors stronger security. \u201cWe have some on the Democratic side who want to have illegal immigrants in the system, not stand in line\u2026and have it be this free for all,\u201d Mace said. \u201cWe\u2019re a nation of laws.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Mace, the former Graham challenger, is also a firm believer in Trump\u2019s America First foreign policy. She can recall when Republicans booed Ron Paul on a South Carolina presidential debate stage in 2012, only to have future president Trump make the same arguments about nation-building and \u201cendless wars.\u201d Trump even said, in a Myrtle Beach debate four years later, that George W. Bush \u201clied\u201d about the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that [Trump] has been able to win that argument and get people onboard with that as a mission, because we are involved in too much overseas,\u201d Mace says. \u201cI think we have to look at our foreign policy and where our place is in the world and where it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t constantly send billions and billions and billions of dollars overseas to countries who hate us and burn our flag,\u201d Mace said.\n\nMace believes she alone can unseat Cunningham and return this South Carolina House seat to a Republican who is both pro-Trump and pro-liberty. We have to \u201cfind common ground with Trump supporters, and also those who don\u2019t support him on every issue,\u201d Mace said.\n\nShe believes the key is to attract a broad coalition of independents and others by \u201chaving a Republican candidate who can thread that needle and pull in fiscal conservatives, pull in Trump supporters, pull in military vets, and women too.\u201d\n\nSo far, according to her fundraising and the polls, Nancy Mace is on point.\n\nJack Hunter is the former political editor of Rare.us and co-authored the 2011 book The Tea Party Goes to Washington with Senator Rand Paul.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-28-at-10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
