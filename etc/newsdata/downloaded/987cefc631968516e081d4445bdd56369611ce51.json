Others have been denied access to flights, including Dexter the peacock and one woman\u2019s squirrel.\n\nBut Flirty the mini service horse successfully joined her owner, Abrea Hensley, on an American Airlines flight departing Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare international airport last week.\n\nThe horse caught the attention of fellow travelers who were surprised to see hooves queueing up to check in among the usual feet and suitcase wheels.\n\n\u201cThere was a small horse in line at the airport today and I\u2019m curious about it,\u201d Twitter user Amberley Babbage said alongside a picture of Flirty with Hensley at the AA check-in desk.\n\nAmberley Babbage (@AmberleyBabbage) There was a small horse in line at the airport today and I\u2019m so curious about it. #ORD pic.twitter.com/bwX1HEeYcH\n\nHensley later posted on Instagram pictures of Flirty on the flight, including one with a group of smiling flight crew members.\n\n\u201cThey were fantastic and kind and very excited to see Flirty on their flight! Even the pilots had to come out to say hi,\u201d read the caption.\n\nHensley, of Bellevue, Nebraska, told local news station KMTV 3 in February that most local businesses in her home town are welcoming to Flirty. She takes the horse to the movies, grocery shopping and even to her doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nFlirty, who has a popular Instagram page and Twitter account, is described by his human handler as a \u201cpsych & mobility service horse\u201d, and according to American Airlines is in fact a trained service animal. Hensley suffers from a variety of ailments including: depression, severe anxiety, panic disorder and PTSD.\n\nPlay Video 14:32 Creature comforts: has the US's emotional support animal epidemic gone too far? \u2013 video\n\nBut not everyone is friendly to Flirty. Hensley told the news station that she had been kicked out of stores twice and was \u201ctreated so poorly\u201d by the managers. She said she was looking into pursuing legal action against the businesses.\n\nBesides dogs, miniature horses who have been \u201cindividually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities\u201d are the only other service animals the Department of Justice deems protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. So like any other service animal, businesses that serve the public must allow Flirty to accompany her owner.\n\nAn American Airlines representative told the Today Show that they were happy to have Flirty onboard. \u201cWe recognize the important role trained service dogs, cats and miniature horses can play in the lives of those with disabilities.\u201d\n\nHensley said in a tweet that, while her flight with Flirty went well, she will try to conduct their travels by car because it is easier on her horse and other passengers.", "description": "Passengers surprised to see quadruped at check-in as Flirty the mini horse takes American Airlines flight", "authors": ["Lauren Aratani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a2149b557c22693f8d0a0e91b8f729cf383fac/0_160_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3334acd54fe7039f75ceae0cbcbbc84"}
