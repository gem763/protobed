The 60 second tree\n\nMarks & Spencer Memory Branch 7ft Snowy Christmas Tree (\u00a369)\n\nWhat would Christmas be without a tree?\n\nIf you're one of the many people who prefer an artificial tree, whether due to allergies or environmental concerns, then why not make this the year you give yours an upgrade?\n\nMarks & Spencer has a large range of options starting from only \u00a35 for a cute 1.5ft tree.\n\nAnd our favourite has got to be this 7ft snowy beauty (above) which comes with a five year guarantee.\n\nNot only is it extremely pretty with its dusting of snowflakes, it's incredibly easy to set up. In fact, it only takes a super fast 60 seconds, thanks to its Memory Branch technology which sees the foliage fall effortlessly into place.\n\nSo you can get to the fun bit of decorating straight away.\n\n2. Christmas in a box!\n\nMarks & Spencer 6ft Christmas Tree Bundle (\u00a335)\n\nFirst Christmas in a new house? Lacking in time in the busy run up to the festive season?\n\nThen take the pressure off and make things easy on yourself with this fantastic Christmas Tree Bundle from M&S (above).\n\nThe set includes a pre-lit 6ft tree, a glittering star topper and 59 hanging baubles in the jolly shades of the season; green, red and gold.\n\nAnd at only \u00a335 for the whole lot, that's truly unbeatable Christmas value.\n\n3. All that glitters\n\nMarks & Spencer 40 Pack Gold Mix Shatterproof Baubles (\u00a37.50)\n\nEvery year we go to unpack our Christmas decorations and without fail, we find a few that are very much past their best.\n\nIf this scenario is sounding familiar then Marks & Spencer has got you covered. With stylish individual decorations from as little as \u00a34 each and multi-packs starting at \u00a35 for 12, you can redo your whole tree without spending a fortune.\n\nAnd our pick of the bunch is this set of 40 shiny shatterproof baubles (above). In opulent gold and with plenty of sparkle, they'll dress up your tree with a touch of luxury.\n\nThe scent of Christmas\n\nFill the air with festive fragrance.\n\n4. A candle with extra sparkle\n\nMarks & Spencer Winter Apple & Spice Silver Light Up Candle (\u00a38)\n\nNot only does this lovely candle (above) give off the scent of warm apple and winter spices but when lit, the LEDs built into the jar begin to shine too, throwing off twinkling light around your home.\n\nIt'll make a gorgeous addition to any living room, bedroom or dining table, creating an enchanting atmosphere as we get closer to the big day itself.\n\n5. Mistletoe and mandarin\n\nL-R: Mistletoe & Fir 100ml Diffuser (\u00a310) and Mistletoe & Fir Candle (\u00a35) at Marks & Spencer\n\nWhen we think of Christmas, we think mistletoe and the scent of fir trees.\n\nAnd this evocative mix is now available in a gorgeous diffuser and candle as part of Marks & Spencer's festive home collection (both above).\n\nYou'll also note eucalyptus and juniper alongside undertones of spicy clove, woody pine and vanilla; it's the fragrance of winter all wrapped up.\n\nL-R: Mandarin, Cinnamon & Clove 100ml Diffuser (\u00a310) and Mandarin, Cinnamon & Clove Candle (\u00a35) at Marks & Spencer\n\nBut if you'd like a fruitier fragrance then opt for this mandarin infused scent instead.\n\nBursting with a mix of citrus and deeper hints of vanilla, there's a hint of spice with nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and cedarwood too.\n\nIt comes in a 100ml diffuser, as well as a long burning candle (both above) so your home can be warm and welcoming all season long.\n\nCooking up Christmas\n\nMarks & Spencer's cookware is not only stylish, it makes a great gift for the foodie in your life\n\nOne of the best things about Christmas is the food. Mince pies, turkey, pigs-in-blankets, Christmas cake, Yule log; we'll take it all.\n\nAnd if you love cooking up a storm for family and friends then why not treat yourself to some new kit, to make it all even more special?\n\n6.
