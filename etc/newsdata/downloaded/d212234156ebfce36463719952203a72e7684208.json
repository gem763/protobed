We have prepared for that.\n\n\u201cWhatever comes our way, we\u2019ll handle it. Our gameplan suits dry and wet weather pretty well, so there won\u2019t be any major adjustments because of the weather.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the threat of attacking backs loaded, but if your boys are mauling and handling the set piece like our boys are at the moment, you are not going to stop.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa are odds-on favourites to end a run of four defeats by Wales and Pollard, who will be winning his 47th cap, knows his role as ringmaster is to keep his big forwards moving.\n\n\u201cAs a fly-half, you just let the boys go. It\u2019s my responsibility to keep our big boys going forward for the majority of the game,\u201d Pollard said.\n\n\u201cWhen you start turning around, it takes a lot out of your forwards, and you use a lot of energy.\n\n\u201cI try to keep them on the front foot for as long as possible, and when we get the opportunity to get our maul or set piece going, I must make sure they are ready to go.\n\n\u201cWales know what they\u2019re good at and focus on that. They are relentless in those areas.\n\nHandre Pollard is ready to take on Wales once again (David Davies/PA)\n\n\u201cThey starve you of possession and territory, and enforce their kicking game on you.\n\n\u201cThey take away your set piece. It\u2019s not a gameplan or rugby with a lot of flair in it, but it\u2019s suffocating.\n\n\u201cIf you fall into that trap, they will enforce their gameplan on you for 80 minutes, and you will probably not win that match.\n\n\u201cLately we\u2019ve struggled against them. It\u2019s always our last game on the end-of-year tour, after a long season and in the Millennium Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tough and you never have all your guys fit and ready to go. So it\u2019s going to be nice to play them on a neutral ground with the teams having most of their guys available for selection.\u201d", "description": "The Springboks have named six forwards on their bench for what Handre Pollard expects to be a", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/08/wire-20209484-1572074352-0_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
