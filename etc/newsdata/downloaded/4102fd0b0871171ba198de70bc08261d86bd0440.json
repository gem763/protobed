A previous version of this video misstated the age when Buttigieg was elected mayor. USA TODAY\n\nI pledge to nominate at least 50% women to my Cabinet and to the judiciary. Gender equity will be at the forefront of our policies at home and abroad.\n\nEvery day, millions of women in the United States go to work \u2014 as first responders, doctors, teachers, CEOs or caregivers. Some do so in jobs they love, and many others do so just to make next month\u2019s rent. Women go to work even when they have a sick child at home because they can't take time off to go to the doctor. They worry that, once again, they will be overlooked for a promotion, even though they deserve it. And far too many women have to protect themselves against harassment and assault at home and at work. Despite all of this, women continue to support their families and lead in their communities.\n\nThroughout history, we\u2019ve watched women lead powerful movements for justice. In the past few years, women organized the Women\u2019s March, insisted on the importance of black lives and raised their voices to hold powerful abusers accountable. The 2018 elections marked historic gains for women in Congress, propelled by the activism of women voters \u2014 particularly black women.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, walks through an abortion demonstration at the U.S. Supreme Court on May 21, 2019.

Women today are more likely to die from pregnancy than their mothers were; black and Native American women die from pregnancy at much higher rates than white women. And all over the country, women\u2019s right to control their own bodies has been under assault by largely male legislatures.\n\nAt an event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, this year, a woman in the front row asked what I\u2019d do for women if elected president. It\u2019s a question I get wherever I go on the campaign trail. The answer, laid out in a plan I\u2019m releasing Thursday, is that my administration will work systematically to build women\u2019s power in our economy, our political system and in every part of our society.\n\n1. Close the pay gap\n\nFirst, our plan will close the pay and wealth gaps. That means guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. But it also means addressing all the ways women are excluded from opportunity. We will invest $10 billion to end workplace sexual harassment and discrimination against women, and double the funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to hold employers who discriminate accountable. We'll make sure every family has access to affordable child care and make 12 weeks of paid family leave available to every worker, so women don\u2019t have to choose between a career or their kids. And with women receiving less than 3% of venture capital funding \u2014 despite starting businesses at similar rates to men and generating better returns for their investors \u2014 we\u2019ll make available over $50 billion to grow women-owned businesses so we can all benefit from that economic growth.\n\n2. Protect women's health\n\nSecond, our plan will advance women\u2019s health and protect a woman\u2019s right to choose. As president, I will guarantee every woman affordable health coverage by offering Medicare for All Who Want It. My administration will tackle disparities in health, whether that means ensuring that LGBTQ+ people receive respectful care or eliminating racial disparities in maternal mortality.\n\nYear of the Woman 2: Record 2018 election success for women that goes way beyond the numbers\n\nAnd as women\u2019s reproductive rights are under attack all around the country, we will write abortion rights into law because a woman \u2014 and only a woman \u2014 should make decisions about her own body.\n\n3. Make America safe for women\n\nThird, as we mark National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our plan will also prioritize safe, inclusive communities. Every woman should be able to live free from violence or harassment, whether online, on campus or in her own home. That\u2019s why, in addition to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, my administration will take a 21st century approach to gender-based violence. We\u2019ll close the boyfriend loophole that allows partners convicted of domestic abuse to purchase firearms, teach consent in school to change our culture of harassment and discrimination, and tackle online harassment.\n\n4. Put women in power\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll close the leadership gap so that women can secure equal power and influence. I am committed to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment during my administration to formalize women\u2019s legal equality. Because personnel is policy, I pledge to nominate at least 50% women to my Cabinet and to the judiciary. We\u2019ll put gender equity at the forefront of our policies at home and abroad. We\u2019ll pursue campaign finance reform that will make it easier for women to enter politics and create a more representative government. And we will push companies to increase transparency and make sure women and diverse leaders can rise to the top, because it is unacceptable that women make up 45% of workers at S&P 500 companies but just 5% of S&P 500 CEOs.\n\nDear Taylor Swift: You are not a victim, so stop acting like one.\n\nRecently, I received a note from a girl named Lia, who told me she\u2019ll be turning 13 years old soon. She said that she thinks everyone should have equal rights, but that in some places, people act as though men are at a much higher level than women, which is not right. I couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nIt\u2019s time to break with the past so that when Lia grows up, she can be confident of entering a workplace where she\u2019ll get paid what she deserves and what she has earned. She\u2019ll know that the decisions we made in 2020 paved the way for women of every background to exercise full economic, social and political power. She, along with millions more women and girls like her, will know what real equality in America feels like. And the whole country will be better off.\n\nPete Buttigieg is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a candidate for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination.
