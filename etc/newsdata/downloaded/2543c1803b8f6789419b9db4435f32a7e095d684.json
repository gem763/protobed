(Johanes Eisele/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images) (Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn two of the biggest sports moments of the weekend \u2014 a much-hyped NFL season opener and the U.S. Open men\u2019s singles final \u2014 Richard Mille nearly stole the show.\n\nOne of the luxurious watches produced by the Swiss brand, oddly, turned up on the left wrist of Odell Beckham Jr. on Sunday as the wide receiver made his debut with the Cleveland Browns. That night, another Richard Mille timepiece was front and center on the right wrist of Rafael Nadal, as it so often is, as he was winning his 19th Grand Slam tournament. Together, the two watches were worth nearly $1 million.\n\nBeckham wore an orange RM 11-03 Automatic Flyback Chronograph McLaren that cost him $189,500 at a Richard Mille boutique, a company representative wrote in an email. He kept the watch on his wrist during the Browns\u2019 Week 1 loss to the Tennessee Titans, a violation of NFL rules prohibiting players from wearing hard objects. Never mind that the exquisite piece of workmanship could be damaged; it could actually hurt someone. The NFL will speak with Beckham about his decision to wear the watch, the Associated Press reported.\n\n[Rafael Nadal beats Daniil Medvedev in U.S. Open final for his 19th Grand Slam singles title]\n\nThe watch favored by Beckham was one of only 500 made of that model. (\u201cIt\u2019s indestructible,\u201d Beckham told Yahoo Sports.)\n\nBeckham \u201cis not a brand partner and it is his decision to wear his watch on the field,\u201d a company spokeswoman wrote.\n\n\u201cSince the brand began, Mr. Mille only forms partnerships with athletes who commit to wearing a Richard Mille watch while they perform their sport,\u201d Laura Hughes, director of communications at Richard Mille, Americas, wrote in a statement. \u201cThey provide the ultimate proving ground for the highly complicated timepieces that are created to be ultra comfortable and precise timekeepers in extremely challenging physical conditions.\u201d\n\n\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. drew the attention of the NFL for wearing a Richard Mille watch while playing. (Ron Schwane / Associated Press)\n\nIndividual sports are often more forgiving than the NFL when it comes to branded accessories. For those competitors, wearing a watch while competing is a smart business arrangement, another advertising opportunity for sponsors. Rolex and Omega, for instance, have long partnered with athletes in individual sports, and Nadal has been a brand ambassador for Richard Mille for years. That explains why he wore one of the company\u2019s watches while beating Daniil Medvedev in the epic five-set final Sunday. (Mevedev has his own side gig with luxury watchmaker Bovet 1822.)\n\n[For the Browns and others, Week 1 of the NFL season delivers an unexpected shock to the system]\n\nFor Nadal, the RM 27-03 Tourbillon Rafael Nadal limited-edition watch (which retails for $769,000) is something of a good-luck charm, and his model is a nod to his native Spain, according to the Richard Mille website. \u201cThe striking red and yellow hues of its Quartz TPT case pay homage to Rafa\u2019s native Spain, while the upper skeletonized bridge evokes the forward-facing head of a bull,\u201d the site says, in subdued prose. \u201cA symbol of Spain, this animal is also Nadal\u2019s chosen emblem.\u201d\n\nThe RM27-03 was designed to absorb the force of Nadal\u2019s swing, Forbes reported, and, in promotional material, Nadal also said the timepiece feels right.\n\n\u201cRichard came to my house and showed me a model saying: \u2018This is the watch that we made for you,\u2019 \u201d Nadal said in a blurb on the company\u2019s website. \u201cThe watch was in platinum so [it was] very heavy, I was very confused and didn\u2019t realize that he was joking. As soon as I tried the real watch on, I loved it. We were on the same wavelength. The watch is now like a second skin for me.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a second skin that isn\u2019t for everyone, though. The company, based in Les Breuleux, Switzerland, was founded by Dominique Guenat and Richard Mille in 2001 and produces opulent timepieces that cost \u2014 well, if you have to ask, you can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\n\nWhat time is it? (Ron Schwane/AP)\n\nRichard Mille has company in the high-end watch sponsorship realm. Roger Federer often wears a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust, among other models. Novak Djokovic, a brand ambassador for Seiko, wears a $2,000 Seiko Astron Novak Djokovic Limited Edition GPS solar-powered watch that bears his signature on the back. Serena Williams wore an Audemars Piguet watch during the U.S. Open women\u2019s final Saturday and Naomi Osaka sported a Citizen Eco-Drive Bluetooth watch during the Open.\n\nRichard Mille also works with polo players, Formula 1 drivers, skiers, track and field athletes and golf star Bubba Watson.\n\n\u201cRichard Mille has had a genuine relationship with professional athletes for many years,\u201d Hughes told Complex, \u201cand it only gets deeper.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nPerspective: It\u2019s Antonio Brown\u2019s NFL now and everyone else is just living in it\n\nThe Browns\u2019 offseason hype was different, but the final score looked awfully familiar to fans\n\nMorgan Moses calls out Redskins\u2019 coaches for sitting Adrian Peterson: \u2018It\u2019s a slap in the face\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s take on Antonio Brown: \u2018Whatever\u2019", "description": "Nadal has an arrangement to wear Richard Mille watches on the court.
