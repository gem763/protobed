She\u2019s infamous, but Meryl was able to humanize her.\u201d The real-life \u201cLindy Chamberlain wasn\u2019t a good actress, she wasn\u2019t able to convince anybody that she didn\u2019t kill her kid because she wasn\u2019t willing to play by the rules of socially acceptable femininity. She just refused to do that,\u201d Carlson says of Chamberlain, who was convicted of killing her daughter in 1982 then exonerated in 2012, 32 years after her child\u2019s death. \u201cI think Meryl was attracted to that role because she maybe saw pieces of herself in it. She wants to speak the truth of women like that. Those are the women who were killed in the Salem witch trials, they are Amanda Knox, they are Hillary Clinton. She was attracted to that and wanted to humanize these women.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Queen Meryl: The Iconic Roles, Heroic Deeds, and Legendary Life of Meryl Streep,\u2019 by Erin Carlson, comes out Sept. 24", "authors": ["Shannon Carlin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x5pyVzWIhInjLx86B4KKWnnppQs=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F6DD7DB2IFHWRISMO3MUVQXWY4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
