He then pitched the idea of a laser show in the national capital which would not only provide a common platform for people to celebrate the festival of lights together but also act as a deterrent against the use of firecrackers.\n\nDon't Miss 118 SHARES 583 SHARES 975 SHARES 126 SHARES\n\nSisodia, Delhi CM\u2019s closest aid, had acknowledged his suggestion during his speech at the red-carpet event, which he had graced as the chief guest.\n\nAs Diwali approaches once again and indicators have already begun showing concerns of rising pollution, Kejriwal has now announced that a mega laser show will be organised in the Connaught Place region of Delhi.\n\nHe said as Delhi is facing an onslaught of smoke from outside, the city will have to take measures to reduce the local pollution as much as possible.\n\n\"In order to encourage people to not burst crackers this Diwali, the Delhi government is organising a laser show in Connaught Place between October 26-29 from 7 p.m. onwards. I invite all of Delhi to enjoy the laser show,\" the Chief Minister was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.\n\nWith the onset of winter, the air quality of the city has started deteriorating. Kejriwal also urged other state governments to take steps to control stubble burning.\n\nThe air quality in Delhi had shown significant improvement in recent weeks. In fact, it was the cleanest September in nine years this time but indicators are once again pointing to a grim picture now.\n\n\"Pollution is a complex problem and could only have reduced due to the collective efforts of all governments and agencies in Delhi. Everyone made their efforts, but the most important contribution was made by the people of Delhi. I have always maintained that no effort to tackle climate change or pollution can succeed until the people enthusiastically participate in these efforts. The people of Delhi have participated in all efforts and even welcomed certain harsh steps we took against pollution,\" he said, crediting the people of Delhi for participating in the government''s fight against pollution.\n\nThe idea behind hosting a laser show in Delhi is to say no to crackers and pollution causing agents while retaining the ethereal charm of the festival that is celebrated with much fervour across the country and many parts of the world every year.\n\nUnder the programme, people will be encouraged to attend the laser show in large numbers and it will be organised on a massive scale so that the visitors do not return home with a sense of regret. The overall objective is to decrease pollution levels.", "description": "A mega Diwali laser show will be organised by the Delhi government in the national capital to dissuade people from bursting crackers.
