Federal prosecutors said the two medical professionals help fuel the state\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nOPIOID DOCTOR'S 40-YEAR SENTENCE IS STARK REMINDER OF WIDESPREAD OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC\n\nSpayd, an advanced nurse practitioner and owner of Eagle River Wellness in Eagle River, was charged with distribution of narcotic substances resulting in death. Davidhizar, a physician at Family Medical Clinic in Soldotna, was charged with distribution of a scheduled controlled substance.\n\nSpayd allegedly distributed more than 4 million doses of opioid narcotics, including oxycodone, methadone, and hydromorphone, to 450 patients between 2014 and 2019. At least 19 of her patients \"died within one month of filling an opioid prescription\" she issued, according to court documents. Twelve died within two weeks and five died the same day or the next day.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spotted signals -- including patients traveling long distances, prescriptions written before previous prescriptions expired, and patients using multiple names and pharmacies \u2014 that led them to Spayd, according to court documents. Some pharmacies in Anchorage stopped filling prescriptions written by Spayd, Anchorage\u2019s KTUU-TV of Anchorage reported.\n\nDavidhizar prescribed so many narcotic pills he became known by drug users as \"the Candy Man,\" authorities said. Court documents stated he prescribed more than 700,000 narcotic pills between 2017 and 2019, and \"it was common knowledge that people could obtain pain medication prescriptions from him even though they did not have a legitimate medical need.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nUndercover FBI agents posed as patients with signs of opioid addiction but \"little pain justifying the opioids they sought,\" court documents stated. Davidhizar still prescribed them the drugs.\n\nDavidhizar was put on probation in 1999 for a two-year period and fined $5,000 for failing to keep medical records for prescriptions, KTUU reported. He was placed on probation again in 2009 for five years and fined $35,000 for overprescribing drugs and failing to show concern for patients\u2019 wellbeing.\n\nSpayd faces a minimum of 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges, while Davidhizar faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An Alaska\u00a0nurse practitioner and a doctor dubbed \"the Candy Man\" were charged Wednesday with providing millions of opioid doses to patients who did not medically require the drugs, which in turn fueled addiction and caused overdoses and deaths, officials said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/painkiller-guidelines_cham1280720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
