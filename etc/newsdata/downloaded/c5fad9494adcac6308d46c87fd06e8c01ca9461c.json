A police officer\u2019s life was seriously endangered. In order to save his and other officers\u2019 lives, they fired at the attacker.\u201d\n\nOne clip posted on social media and verified by Reuters shows the protester, an as yet unnamed 18-year-old man, swing a baton at a policeman, brushing his right arm.\n\nWhen the footage is slowed down, a white flash appears at the end of the pistol barrel pointing at the protester\u2019s chest from around a meter away. The protester stumbles over another policeman and falls on his back.\n\nA second protester wearing a yellow construction hat rushes to the wounded man\u2019s aid before being tackled to the ground by police.\n\nAfter lying motionless for several moments, the wounded protester removes his gas mask and calls weakly for help, giving his name and saying his chest hurts and that he needs to go to hospital. A policeman then kneels beside him and begins to tend to his wound.\n\nProtesters have been hit before with bean bags and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air.\n\nThe incident came as thousands of protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, took to the streets to defy the city\u2019s Chinese rulers on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic.", "description": "Amateur video of violent demonstrations in Hong Kong on Tuesday captures the moment when a policeman points a pistol at a black-clad protester and fires a round, after which the young man falls to the floor.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
