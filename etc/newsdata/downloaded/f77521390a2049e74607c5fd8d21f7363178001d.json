turn to SE Asia amid Hong Kong unrest", "language": "en", "text": "Kuala Lumpur (AFP) \u2013 From luxury Singapore apartments to Malaysian seafront condos, Hong Kong investors are shifting cash into Southeast Asian property, demoralised by increasingly violent protests as well as the China-US trade war.\n\nMillions have taken to the streets during four months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the southern Chinese city, hammering tourism while also forcing businesses to lay off staff \u2014 and the property sector is feeling the pain.\n\nProperty stocks in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets have plummeted since June, with developers being forced to offer discounts on new projects and cutting office rents.\n\nHong Kong businessman Peter Ng bought a condominium on the Malaysian island of Penang \u2014 which has a substantial ethnic Chinese population and is popular among Hong Kongers \u2014 after the protests erupted.\n\n\u201cThe instability was a catalyst for me,\u201d the 48-year-old stock market and property investor told AFP, adding he was worried about long-term damage to the Hong Kong economy if the unrest persists.\n\n\u201cInvestors will always look at things like that, political stability.\u201d\n\nAnd Derek Lee, a Hong Kong businessman who owns a Penang apartment, said he knew others in the semi-autonomous city who were considering investing in Southeast Asian property because of the unrest.\n\n\u201cPeople are thinking about how to quicken their ideas, how to make a more stable life,\u201d the 55-year-old told AFP.\n\nAdding to the allure of Malaysia is its relative affordability and prices much lower than Hong Kong.\n\nThe Malaysia site of Southeast Asian real estate platform Property Guru has seen a 35 percent increase in visits from Hong Kong, according to its CEO Hari Krishnan.\n\n\u2013 China-fuelled boom \u2013\n\nWhile Hong Kong\u2019s protests are primarily pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability, the summer of rage has been fuelled by years of simmering anger towards Beijing and the local government over falling living standards and the high costs of living.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s property market is one of least affordable in the world with sky-high prices fuelled, in part, by wealthy mainlanders snapping up investments in a city which has failed for years to build enough flats to meet demand.\n\nBut now mainland Chinese, who traditionally viewed property in Hong Kong as a safe investment, are opting for rival financial hub Singapore as a result of the protests and the US-China trade war, according to observers.\n\nThere has been a jump this year in sales of luxury apartments in the city-state \u2014 which like Hong Kong is known for pricey property \u2014 driven partially by mainland Chinese buyers, according to the consultancy OrangeTee & Tie.\n\n\u201cThe protests in Hong Kong have made some of the (mainland Chinese) based there\u2026 (more concerned) about investing in Hong Kong real estate, so they carry that investment to Singapore,\u201d said Alan Cheong, executive director of the research and consultancy team at Savills.\n\nAs well as hitting China\u2019s economy, trade tensions may have discouraged some Chinese from investing in the West and pushed them towards Singapore, with its mostly ethnic Chinese population.\n\n\u201cI think they don\u2019t want to go to the West,\u201d said Cheong.\n\nSingapore is \u201cthe closest country culturally to China other than Hong Kong, and I think they feel more comfortable with that\u201d.\n\nThere are further signs the stable, tightly ruled city is benefiting from the Hong Kong turmoil \u2014 Goldman Sachs last week estimated as much as $4 billion flowed out of Hong Kong to Singapore this summer.\n\nAnd analysts warned there was little hope of Hong Kong\u2019s property market recovering soon.\n\n\u201cHong Kong property share prices have corrected by about 15 to 25 percent since July,\u201d said Raymond Cheng, head of Hong Kong and China property at CGS-CIMB Securities International.\n\nResidential sales were still holding up but only when developers offered discounts, office rents were expected to fall by as much as five percent and shop rents were also badly affected, he said.\n\nBut despite the unrest, businessman Ng \u2014 who will rent his Penang property and has no plans to move there permanently for now \u2014 was still hopeful about Hong Kong\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\n\u201cThe problem may not be solved in the short term but it is not so serious as pessimists think,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything is still in the government\u2019s control.\u201d\n\nburs-sr/dan/qan", "description": "Kuala Lumpur (AFP) \u2013 From luxury Singapore apartments to Malaysian
