Depending on who was telling the story, it was someone\u2019s neighbour, their cousin or their grandmother who had found the century-old article.\n\nBut the date set for drenching rain came and went.\n\nWe are talking about 'drought-proofing' again \u2013 they are simplistic solutions that will destroy Australia | John Williams Read more\n\nThe same magical thinking has happened in recent years, too: rumours of impending drought-breakers have swirled around many times. Most of the time if the grey clouds appear, they don\u2019t linger.\n\nI live in Orange, in the central west of New South Wales, where the council has just introduced strict level-five water restrictions.\n\nIt means the town\u2019s total water storage has fallen to 30%. The local council suggests three-minute showers, shallow baths and only using washing machines when there\u2019s a full load.\n\nLawns cannot be watered and gardens only once a week for an hour in the evening. There\u2019s no washing cars at home, no water features and no filling kids\u2019 pools.\n\nVarying degrees of restrictions are in place in other nearby regional towns, including Bathurst and Dubbo.\n\nAnnouncing the latest rules, the Orange mayor, Reg Kidd, said: \u201cOrange residents have some of the lowest rates of water use in the country. We\u2019re used to this and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll get through this drought.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time we\u2019ve learned to capture water in whatever way we can: showering with buckets at our feet or scooping out children\u2019s bath water for the garden.\n\nMemories of droughts mark time through my childhood. My dad \u2013 a stock agent \u2013 would abruptly halt conversations at the dinner table to listen to the weather on the 7pm news. After work, dust settles in the lines on his face and hands, and tints his snowy hair.\n\nA few teachers at my high school had to start coming into town to shower when the tanks on their properties ran dry during the millennium drought.\n\nMy mum, a dedicated gardener, has fought to keep trees on my parents\u2019 farm alive through droughts and harsh summers, lugging heavy containers from their rainwater tank to whichever plant was closest to death.\n\nA horticulturalist once told me that if you look closely at trees around the region, you can see the ghosts of droughts in the branches and foliage that were growing at those times.\n\nThis drought is often referred to by farmers as the worst in living memory, as they hand-feed their animals or consider selling off their valuable breeding stock or think about leaving the land.\n\nGrowing up being constantly reminded that water is finite and rain is unreliable is in the back of my mind wherever I go.\n\nIn Sydney this year I watched a man hose the footpath in front of a harbourside mansion, my mouth hanging open thinking of the crunchy brown paddocks back home. At the shops, I think about how much water is needed to produce meat, vegetables and crops, and the water needed for storing and transporting food.\n\nFrom sharing showers to native plants: give us your tips on how to save water Read more\n\nDriving on bumpy country roads, I think about the water needed to fix them and to build more. Looking out my window at the new homes going up in my neighbourhood, I think about the water needed for construction and housing for a growing population.\n\nWater is everywhere but increasingly it\u2019s nowhere.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to me that we know water is a life-giver in many ways, but recycled drinking water is still mostly taboo.\n\nIt seems to take a lot for restrictions to be enforced in major cities, where the effects of drought are out of sight out of mind.\n\nHaving lived in a city for a little over a decade before returning home, I\u2019ve seen that people are not really aware that what\u2019s going down the bathroom drain, or being hosed on to cars, or poured into pools is a precious resource.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we all have limits on our water use all the time, even when dams are full?\n\nPerhaps using water like it lasts forever is just a different kind of magical thinking.", "description": "Growing up being constantly reminded that water is finite and rain is unreliable is in the back of my mind wherever I go", "authors": ["Stephanie Gardiner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9efb728cdc5538446b00753206979bb1d54760d/0_29_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=950118b29797f70a45eb72cc42b0ce09", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
