Kennedy international airport handles today.\n\nThe government plans to build and operate the airport, whose formal title will be Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport, until it is ready to sell it.\n\nThe airport's chief executive, Graham Millett, has previously said the airport will be \"a prize piece of infrastructure\" that will most likely be floated in an initial public offering to attract billions of dollars from superannuation funds seeking long-term investments.\n\nThe government has refused to disclose how much the new terminal building will cost.\n\nUnlike the incumbent Sydney Airport, which has a night curfew, the new airport will operate around the clock, giving it an advantage particularly in teeing up deals with freight operators that want to fly goods to Asia overnight.\n\nMr Millett wants to make air-freight rates more competitive with road- and sea-freight rates and plans to pitch the airport to agribusinesses that export perishable goods to Asia.\n\nQantas and Virgin Australia have already started talks with the new airport over potential routes, and construction contracts are in the process of being awarded.\n\nWhile the airport is initially expected to attract low-cost airlines, it is also keen to cater for ultra-long-range routes such as Sydney-London and Sydney-New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Iraq-born founder of Zaha Hadid Architects, Zaha Hadid, was a British citizen who died of a heart attack in early 2016. She was the first woman to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize, which is considered architecture's highest honour.\n\nThe airport is being developed in four stages with the aim of handling 10 million passengers a year when it opens in 2026.\n\nZaha Hadid Architects designed Beijing's Daxing International Airport and India's Navi Mumbai International Airport.\n\nCox's former projects include Perth's Optus Stadium, Perth Children's Hospital and the Adelaide Botanic High School.\n\nMore than 40 architectural teams tendered for the new airport and five were shortlisted in June to design it, including Design Inc & Foster + Partners; Architectus, Gensler, SAA and Surbana Jurong; Woods Bagot and RSHP; and Hassell and Pascall Watson.", "description": "The architects of Sydney's new airport terminal have been named, but the Commonwealth won't say how much they'll be paid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5052%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_463%2C$y_371/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/81fe822ff7fea3c6a75a7a992ce23198f4cb83ad", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
