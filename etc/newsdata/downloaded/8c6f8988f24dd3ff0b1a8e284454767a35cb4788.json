In addition, salaried members will be eligible for an $11,000 bonus toward continuing education or job-related developments.\n\nThe contract does, however, allow for the GM to proceed with closing three plants, in Lordstown, Ohio, in Warren, Michigan, and another just outside Baltimore.\n\nGM confirmed the contract was ratified by the workers and said the new agreement plans to invest $7.7 billion and 9,000 jobs in the U.S. in a statement.\n\n\"We delivered a contract that recognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of the company, with a strong wage and benefit package and additional investment and job growth in our U.S. operations,\" Mary Barra, chairman and CEO of GM, said in a statement. \"GM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S.\"\n\nNews that a deal has been approved and ratified by the union comes after approximately 49,000 union members were on strike against the auto-manufacturing giants for over a month.\n\n(MORE: UAW increases strike pay for GM workers as negotiations continue)\n\nThe strike began Sept. 16 after a previous labor contract expired and negotiations over a new one fell apart.\n\nUnion leaders had argued that GM workers deserved a bigger slice of the company's profits, which they said have totaled $35 billion in North America over the last three years. As the strike continued, the UAW claimed that for every $1 a GM employee made, CEO Mary Barra made $281.\n\nPHOTO: GM team leader Natalie Walker, 56, leads chants as General Motors assembly workers and their supporters protest during the United Auto Workers (UAW) national strike in Bowling Green, K.Y. on Sept. 20, 2019.
