Their optimism comes after reported the largest increase in private sector jobs in 4 months. also remained low while job cuts eased according to , which suggests that nonfarm payrolls increased in August.\n\nYet there are 5 good reasons why the jobs report could disappoint. According to today\u2019s report, service-sector activity rebounded in August, which is great news because services represent a big part of the economy. Unfortunately, the of the report fell to its lowest level in more than 2 years, which is a problem because this subcomponent of non-manufacturing ISM has the strongest correlation with NFPs. Additionally, the manufacturing sector reported the weakest employment index in 3 years, the 4-week moving average of jobless increased slightly and confidence declined across the board. reported fewer layoffs, but companies are still shedding workers.
