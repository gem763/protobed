REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\n\nSpot gold was up 0.5% at $1,493.50 per ounce, as of 0611 GMT. In the previous session, prices fell to their lowest since Aug. 13 at $1,483.90.\n\nU.S. gold futures were up 0.2% at $1,502.2 an ounce.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is expected to reduce further the interest rate into negative territory... The meeting could serve as a potential catalyst (for gold) and investors are already buying into the rate cut expectations,\u201d said Margaret Yang Yan, a market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nGiven that gold has had such a deep correction from its recent peak, investors are buying on dips, Yan added.\n\nBullion prices have shed more than 4%, or over $60, since scaling an over six-year peak of $1,557 on Sept. 4.\n\nRisk sentiment got a lift ahead of monetary policy decisions by the ECB on Thursday and the U.S. Federal Reserve next week, with investors hoping for further easing amid a slowdown in global growth.\n\nMarket participants might be reluctant to commit to big risk-on bets, which could nudge gold upwards amid pre-positioning ahead of Thursday\u2019s event, said Ilya Spivak, senior currency strategist, DailyFx.\n\nECB policymakers are leaning toward a package that includes a rate cut, a pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks over the side-effects of negative rates, five sources familiar with the discussion said last week.\n\nFundamental backdrop is still broadly gold-supportive considering the main sources of risk aversion remain unresolved, Spivak added.\n\n\u201cBoth Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war are ongoing concerns, as is the broader slowdown in global growth ... That probably encourages central banks to remain dovish.\u201d\n\nGold prices gained about 18%, or over $200, since hitting year\u2019s low of $1,265.85 on May 2.\n\nOn the trade front, a senior White House adviser tamped down expectations on Tuesday for the next rounds of U.S.-China trade talks, urging investors, businesses and the public to be patient about resolving the trade dispute.\n\nSpot gold still targets $1,453, as it has cleared a support at $1,497 per ounce, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar index was steady, while Asian stock markets held firm and bond yields rose on Wednesday.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver gained 1.1% to $18.21 per ounce, having hit a two-week low of $17.75 in the previous session.\n\nPalladium was up 0.3% at $1,566.28 per ounce, while platinum climbed 1.2% to $941.35.", "description": "Gold prices edged up on Wednesday, snapping a four-day losing streak on technical buying, amid expectations that the European Central Bank will dole out stimulus and cut interest rates.", "authors": ["Eileen Soreng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428563404&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A070", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
