He also knew his mom planned to get him some new video games, and he could already picture himself playing with friends.\n\nIn the courtroom, the teenager had heard a judge sentence him to eight years, but he didn\u2019t give that number the weight or the worry it deserved. He thought once he stepped into that cell, those years would dissolve into weeks or days. He thought he would be home in time to unwrap his gifts.\n\n\u201cI was in complete denial,\u201d Bullock recalls. \u201cI thought they\u2019ll realize they just wanted to teach me a hard lesson and they\u2019ll let me go. There was nothing that could convince me at that time that I was actually going to grow up in there.\u201d\n\nWhen Bullock finally walked out of prison, he was a 23-year-old man whose formal education didn\u2019t go beyond completing ninth grade.\n\nYou might think you can guess how Bullock\u2019s life unfolded from there. You would be wrong. Even he couldn\u2019t predict the success he would find, and how it would place him in the unique position to talk about the power of investing in \u201cpeople who seem uninvestable.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Bullock walked into a building just blocks from the White House and stood in front of a room filled with influential people. He was joined there by three other men who share his basic biography. They all are people of color, live in the D.C. area and served time in prison.\n\nThey are all also entrepreneurs who have reached dizzying heights when you consider where they started.\n\nThey came together Wednesday to talk about where they had been so they could convey where they want to go. They were there to offer pitches for expanding their businesses and to explain why an investment in them was also an investment in the public.\n\n\u201cThere is a social mission packed into the DNA of every one of these companies,\u201d explains Sara Gibson, the co-founder of 20 Degrees, a management consulting firm that advises nonprofits and social enterprises. As part of a pilot program offered through a D.C. grant, the company worked with the four men over the last four months to evaluate their business plans and sharpen their pitches.\n\nGibson says each business has the \u201cability to transform communities.\u201d They all employ people with criminal records, and studies have shown the formerly incarcerated are more likely to end up back in prison when they don\u2019t find jobs. They also serve \u201copportunity zones,\u201d which the IRS defines as economically distressed communities \u201cwhere new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment.\u201d\n\n\n\nA sample of the Flikshop postcards that people can send family members who are incarcerated.

But as the former incarcerated reenter the workforce, will their past be held against them]\n\n\u201cThe better they do, the better our communities do, the better the District does, the better America does,\u201d Gibson says. Or to put it more concisely: \u201cThe better these businesses do, the better we all do.\u201d\n\nThe Wednesday event marked the culmination of the program. Among those in the audience were D.C. government officials, wealth managers, impact investors, nonprofit leaders, lawyers and bankers.\n\nLorenzo Stewart knows exactly what his business needs to grow: money to invest in technology.\n\nHe started transporting people with disabilities three years ago to fill a need he noticed from personal experience. At 15, he was shot during a robbery and ended up paralyzed from the waist down. From his wheelchair, he encountered elevators that were broken, cabs that wouldn\u2019t stop for him and ride services that would tell him to call back in two hours because no one could accommodate him.\n\nHe named his company VOW, he explains, because those situations \u201cmade me take a vow to help provide services for people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nHe now has four vans and, through different contracts, takes people to and from appointments and transports children for a private school in the District. He picks up one from New York Avenue, where homeless families are housed in hotels.\n\n[Homeless children in hotels are struggling to get to school, a group learned. It now wants D.C. officials to consider: If tourists get shuttles, shouldn\u2019t they?]\n\nStewart says he hopes to expand his fleet, offer drivers a chance to receive training beyond the basic requirements and create an app that would allow parents to track their children in real time while they\u2019re in his vans.\n\n\u201cYou can go to my app and you will see that your kid will arrive home in 10 minutes,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s now a 44-year-old married father of two and says he\u2019s come far from the teenager who sold drugs for fast money and served time for it. Now, he wakes at 4 a.m. to start work and loses sleep, worrying about payroll and keeping the business profitable. He says he also believes in hiring people with criminal records because he remembers that frustration of getting temporary jobs that never turned full time.\n\nBullock recalls applying to 41 jobs and facing 41 rejections. He says he finally got lucky at a paint store because of a comma. Others applications had asked: \u201cHave you ever been convicted of a felony?\u201d The one for the paint store read: \u201cHave you been convicted of a felony, within the last seven years?\u201d He was able to say no.\n\nThe 38-year-old blames a \u201cdumb decision\u201d for landing him in the adult prison system in 1996. He and a teenage friend stole a car at gunpoint. No one got hurt, he says, but he lost eight years of his life and his friend lost nine.\n\nAt the paint store, Bullock says he distinguished himself as the top salesperson and soon went from earning $12 an hour to $85,000 a year. He then started his own business, connecting people who came in to buy paint with those who could paint for them. Eventually, his company grew into a construction business that was able to land a project with BWI airport.\n\n\u201cMy life turned into something incredible, something I wasn\u2019t even smart enough to pray for,\u201d Bullock says.\n\nThe idea for his more recent company grew from an office conversation he had with the vice president of his construction business, a man he met in prison named Anthony Belton. They started talking about how they hadn\u2019t spoken in a while to some of their friends who remained incarcerated, and the reasons for that: No one had time to write letters anymore and phone calls from prison were too expensive.\n\nWhen Bullock was in jail, his mother used to send him letters filled with photographs. One picture might show a cheeseburger and come with a reminder that when he got home, he could again \u201cenjoy a fat, juicy burger.\u201d Or she might send a picture of a new shampoo she purchased along with a note saying he would soon be able to take a long shower, with hot or cold water.\n\n\u201cThat was the only thing that kept me alive was my mother\u2019s photos and letters,\u201d Bullock recalls. \u201cI told Tony, \u2018There is an app to help me get my coffee quicker. There has to be an app that helps me connect to my friends in prison.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t, so Bullock worked to create one. Flikshop now allows family members to upload photos with messages that are then printed out at the company\u2019s Southeast D.C. headquarters and mailed as postcards to prisons. Bullock says the app has now connected more than 158,000 families across all 50 states.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing that always gets me, every time I walk into the office: The vast majority of photos that Flikshop ships out are of children,\u201d he says. Those photos show first days of school, Halloween costumes, Christmas mornings. \u201cI see sonogram pictures that are coming through that say, \u2018I know you just got there, but when you come home, we\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u2019 You look at that and you think, \u2018Damn, this is what\u2019s going to keep people out of prison.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe welcomed the chance to talk Wednesday to \u201ca lot of people I probably would not have had the chance to get in front of.\u201d He has spoken at the White House and to tech companies in Silicon Valley, but he says he still gets plenty of doors slammed in his face.\n\nStanding with Stewart and the two other men \u2014 Will Avila and Maurice Dixon \u2014 shows people what he has tried to convey to other investors.\n\n\u201cThere is no shortage of innovative ideas,\u201d he has told them. \u201cThe reality is you guys are not investing in the communities that can come up with them.\u201d", "description": "At 15, Marcus Bullock landed behind bars.
