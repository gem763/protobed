The beauty queen\u2013style peach-colored ball gown features a \u201cMiss Impeachment\u201d sash, a rhinestone studded crown and a silver whistle.\n\n\u201cClaiming collusion won\u2019t get you any justice, but curves like these will get you sent down in history,\u201d Yandy\u2019s website says, offering a final impeachment-related pledge: \u201cNo quid pro quo required.\u201d\n\nYandy is also selling a $60 \u201cSexy Tariff Costume,\u201d which it notes is made in the United States, that pokes fun at Trump\u2019s year-plus trade dispute with China. The sleeveless dress with images of money and the word \u201ctariff\u201d printed on it will allow the trick-or-treater to \u201cbe the hottest import in town,\u201d the site says.\n\nBut for those who want to take a more scholarly route, the \u201cCollege Scandal Costume\u201d could be the right fit. The $70 duds include a crop top with \u201cMom of the Year\u201d crossed out and \u201cInmate\u201d displayed front and center. The scandalous attire is inspired by a widespread college admissions scam that involves Lori Loughlin of \u201cFull House\u201d fame and a bevy of other parents who authorities say illegally paid their children\u2019s ways into colleges and universities.\n\nFormer \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in jail last month for her role in the bribery scandal after she pleaded guilty to mail fraud and honest services fraud charges.\n\nLorenzo Caltagirone, owner of Total Party in Arlington, Va., says among the hot sellers in his store this year are an \u201cOver-inflated Ego\u201d costume that mocks Trump, depicting the commander in chief in a diaper.\n\nBut for Caltagirone, playing politics with dressing up for Halloween hasn\u2019t proven as lucrative in 2019 as in years past: \u201cThis year, the political costumes and masks are not as popular for some reason. I have a feeling it\u2019s because people are so fed up with politics.\u201d\n\nAt Party Depot, web content creator Tony Hill says the demand for Trump pieces among costumed Halloween revelers waned last year. But now with the impeachment drama, sales are starting to spike once again. Trump masks and presidential piggyback costumes \u2014 $45 inflatable jumpsuits that give the illusion of the wearer catching a ride on the president\u2019s back \u2014 are some of the top political items.\n\n\u201cIt went down and went back up,\u201d Hill says. \u201cHe is his own stock market when it comes to Halloween costumes.\u201d\n\nSutton Dunwoodie and Jordan Lancaster contributed.", "description": "Impeachment, the college admissions scandal and even tariffs are all getting the Halloween costume treatment this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tariffimpeachmenthalloweencostumes_100819handout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
