In some cases, this can be weeks or months after a story first breaks.\n\nFor instance, Harry and Meghan Markle's upcoming working trip to South Africa was first first reported in April, but nothing was confirmed until two months later.\n\nSince the duke and duchess created their own Instagram account in April, however, the couple have been favoring social media over the palace's traditional press office.\n\nTheir son, Archie Harrison, had his official christening ceremony in July. To the disappointment of royal fans, they only released two photos to the press.\n\nHowever, they have released more information on their Instagram account, choosing this platform to first unveil Archie's name, alongside a photo of the newborn meeting Queen Elizabeth for the first time.\n\nTheir use of social media could be seen as a new way of hitting back at false stories.\n\nRoyal commentator Kristen Meinzer added that recent rumors of a feud between Harry, Meghan, Kate, and William is nothing more than a \"common trope\" among reality show fans.\n\n\"The British Royal Family is the longest running reality show of all time \u2014 meaning they've been in the press and history books for our consumption (and amusement) for hundreds of years,\" Meinzer, host of the podcast \"When Meghan Met Harry,\" previously told Insider.\n\n\"But let's be real: nothing that's happening now is particularly scandalous. We have two good-looking couples and their young children. We have whispers of some drama between the two men. We have bored people speculating about the two women.\"\n\nShe added: \"For reality show lovers, it's a common trope. But scratch the surface, and you'll usually find there's not much there.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nEllen DeGeneres says she got to hold baby Archie, who 'looks just like Harry' and had more hair than she did when they met\n\nFans are sharing photos of thank you cards they received from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry after Archie's christening\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have hired a social media guru to help them 'conquer the world' through Instagram\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle's names have officially been removed from the charity he started with Prince William a decade ago", "description": "The stories that were reportedly fabricated have never been revealed by Prince William or Prince Harry.", "authors": ["Mikhaila Friel"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78d2ee21214c0fcf7a9075-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
