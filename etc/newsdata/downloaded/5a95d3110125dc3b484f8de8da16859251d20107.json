Leave to one side. Prepare the konjac noodles according to the packet instructions. Rinse and soak the wakame in warm water for about 5 minutes until softened, chop finely.\n\nBring the water to a boil and tip in the ginger and wakame, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. While the water is simmering carefully cut the tea-stained egg in half with a very sharp knife to avoid ripping the yolk. Lay out the egg and all the other ingredients so that once the stock is made you can assemble your soup quickly.\n\nAdd the miso paste and sesame oil to the ginger-infused water and stir to combine.\n\nDivide the noodles between two large bowls, top each bowl with half of the other soup ingredients, keeping each ingredient separate for presentation. Ladle over the hot stock, sprinkle with the spring onions and sesame seeds and serve with soy sauce on the side.\n\nFood facts: Konjac noodles, also called zero noodles, are made from glucomannan flour, which is a product of the large starchy tubers of the konjac plant. The noodles contain 96 per cent water and less than 4 per cent glucomannan fibre, as a result, there are very low in calories but extremely filling.\n\nFollow Beverley Hicks @littlechelseakitchen", "description": "Chicken and ginger noodle soup Somewhere between a bowl of noodles and a bowl soup.\u00a0Get the best of both, with succulent poached chicken, noodles and fresh vegetables all pulled together with a light, miso stock infused with zingy ginger.
