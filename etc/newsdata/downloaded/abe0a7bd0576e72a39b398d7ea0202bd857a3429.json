In the midst of Wednesday's market bloodbath - a continuation of a move of greater than 1,000 DJIA points that started Tuesday after the 10 am release of the ISM manufacturing data - a Fed official came out and tried to calm the markets. According to NY Fed President John Williams, in terms of the U.S. economy, \"right now the outlook is very favorable.\" This is so predictable and so unhelpful to those who trade for a living.\n\nIt's almost as if the Fed has programmed these animatronic figures to come out and blather on using only meaningless, supposedly reassuring cliches every time the market drops. I wouldn't know John Williams the economist from John Williams the legendary composer of movie scores, but John of Star Wars fame has one major advantage - he has actually had a real job. According to his Wikipedia bio, John Williams of NY Fed fame has NEVER held a private sector job. He went straight from earning his PhD at Stanford in 1994 to a job at the Fed and has held different positions within the Federal Reserve system since.\n\nYet, this is the clown who is going to reassure a very nervous market by saying \"there are definitely a lot of uncertainties and risks out there that we need to be navigating,\" Thank you, Captain Obvious, or I guess he would be referred to as Doctor Captain Obvious.\n\nThis guy isn't any smarter than you or I. Also, he is, if anything, less plugged-in to the real doings of real American companies than anyone who takes Jim Cramer's advice and listens to a handful of earnings conference calls every quarter. Yet he is in charge of a balance sheet that last week totaled a cool $3.553 trillion dollars.\n\nThe ISM report showed real pain in the manufacturing economy. That report also didn't reflect - or didn't mention it explicitly, anyway - the real pain that is being felt from the extended labor stoppage at the U.S.' largest manufacturer, General Motors (GM) . Wait until that stoppage, which - in my old auto analyst's brain - seems so obviously to be about legal troubles at the top of the UAW's Solidarity House and so little about wages, benefits or job security, hits month two. The spider web impact of the GM shutdown is going to crater GDP growth in the fourth quarter, not only in the U.S. but in key trading partners Canada and Mexico as well.\n\nDoes Williams know any of this? How many manufacturing company CEOs has he talked to this week? Has he talked to oil workers in the Permian? Or is he just sitting in his ivory tower and puppetting Powell's line?\n\nThere is always a school of thought on Wall Street that dysfunction in D.C. is a good thing for the markets. Less interference, etc. That thinking applies to the Legislative and Executive Branches, though, not the Fed.\n\nWall Street needs to know that the Fed can manage the day-to-day funding of the U.S. financial system and allow markets to value securities without impacting prices. Well, the repo crisis of the past two weeks shows this Fed cannot manage the former, and nearly a decade's worth of quantitative easing (with the specter of more on the horizon) shows they cannot be trusted with the latter.\n\nSo, the fecklessness of these clowns is generating profits for my firm, Excelsior Capital Partners, both on the short side via equities and the long side via bonds. It's been a fun October so far. I am hoping the clowns keep talking and the markets keep tanking.", "description": "John Williams is in charge of a balance sheet that last week totaled a cool $3.553 trillion dollars....GM", "authors": ["Jim Collins", "The Fed'S Doctor Captain Obvious", "John Williams Is In Charge Of A Balance Sheet That Last Week Totaled A Cool", "Trillion Dollars.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9ebdfe2c-cf2d-11e9-805f-75cf860df1a5.jpg"}
