Muro got two 29-28 scores from the judges to a 29-27 in favor of Newell.\n\nA thunderous applause bellowed throughout the Mohegan Sun Arena upon Newell\u2019s entrance. A successful first round by the Connecticut native excited the home crowd even further. The first round was dominant for Newell. \u201cNotorious\u201d was in advantageous position for most of the opening round, but wasn\u2019t able to put Muro away.\n\nAs the fight progressed, the momentum slowly swung in Muro\u2019s favor. Newell tired and began shoot for several unsuccessful takedowns. Muro began controlling Newell in all facets of the ground game. The close second was followed up by a decisive, but not dominant third round for Muro.\n\nThe victory is Muro\u2019s second in Bellator and his first since Bellator 184 in October 2017. He has now won two straight fights and five out of his past eight dating back to early 2017.\n\nThe bout was the first Bellator main-card appearance for Newell and his first fight on his newly signed multi-fight deal with Bellator. After he failed to punch his ticket to the UFC on \u201cDana White\u2019s Contender Series,\u201d the former WSOF title challenger Newell had an unofficial \u201ctryout\u201d fight for Bellator in August. He defeated Corey Browning via submission.\n\nThe 160-pound bout was part of the Bellator 232 main card, which streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 232 results include:\n\nManny Muro def.
