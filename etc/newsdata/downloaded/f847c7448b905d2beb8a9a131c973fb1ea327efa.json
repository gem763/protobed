The sneaky make-up-our-own-rules Nats are trying to steal a five-game series from the imperial Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nLike a pirate ship sweeping up on a stately frigate with treasure in its hold, the Nats have no intention of playing fair in this National League Division Series or acknowledging any big-league code of conduct or unwritten rules of fair play. They want the gold, the diamonds, and, blimey, the pearls, too.\n\nThanks to the bizarre, and probably unfair, dynamics of baseball\u2019s five-game Division Series \u2014 with those five games spread generously over seven days\u2014it is possible for a team with three fab starting pitchers who are game for the heist to come along aside and, \u201carrrrr,\u201d board a mightier ship.\n\nRight now, the Dodgers, tied at a game apiece in this series after the Nationals\u2019 4-2 victory in Friday night\u2019s Game 2, are wondering where Washington got these scary skull-and-cross-bones relievers. Avast, there Nationals, you\u2019ve already used Stephen Strasburg (Tuesday) and Max Scherzer (Friday) in relief \u2014 as keys to two vital victories. Who\u2019ll be swinging down from the rigging next?\n\nWell, if Anibal Sanchez starts Game 3 on Sunday at Nats Park, as Nats Manager Dave Martinez intimated he probably would late Friday night, and the Nats have a lead in the middle innings, then you better expect $140-million lefty Patrick Corbin will be swinging aboard that pretty Dodger Blue vessel. Someone get Corbin an eye patch and a dagger to put between his teeth.\n\n[Barry Svrluga: Stephen Strasburg was the best version of himself just when he needed to be]\n\nNats General Manager Mike Rizzo put out the word almost a month ago that, if the Nats could get to October, they suddenly would have three fabulous new power arms in their much-mocked bullpen, each man with more than 240 strikeouts. And, in crucial maximum-leverage spots, Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin \u2014 combined contracts of $525 million \u2014 were \u201call on-board\u201d with the idea of being relievers between their normal starts.\n\nYeah, right, we\u2019ll believe it when we see it. No one\u2019s ever actually done that \u2014 not on such a scale with three stars all volunteering to clean the Aegean Stables.\n\nBelieve it.\n\nThe plan became fully real, not just hypothetical, before Game 2, when Scherzer said he could pitch an inning. What an inning it turned out to be. With the Nats clinging to a 4-2 lead, Scherzer provided the strikeout-the-side bridge from Sean Doolittle in the seventh inning to closer Daniel Hudson.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018Hey, look, I played catch today. I\u2019m good,\u2019\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in these situations before where you\u2019re pitching on two days\u2019 rest in all-star games and different times in the postseason. I know that on two days\u2019 rest, you\u2019ve got one inning in you. So, I said whatever the situation is, I\u2019m ready to pitch.\u201d\n\nMax, when could you pitch again? That\u2019s when Scherzer may have spoken for all of the Nats\u2019 Big Three \u2014 at least for this Dodgers series. You can\u2019t do this for a month. But for the Nats, the Dodgers are the one huge hurdle to reaching a World Series. Against either St. Louis or Atlanta, they\u2019d face an even battle. This is the one they have to belay by piracy.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it doesn\u2019t matter. For me, you bring it whenever you\u2019re told to bring it,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThis is the playoffs. You lay it on the line every time you touch that field. Whenever I get the ball next, I get the ball.\u201d\n\n[Stephen Strasburg dominates as Nationals take Game 2 of NLDS to even series with Dodgers]\n\nRizzo first saw a limited version of this plan in operation when he was in the front office of the Arizona Diamondbacks in \u201901. They had two superstar starters, Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. And they had a closer, Byung-Hyun Kim, who trashed two potential World Series wins in Yankee Stadium by allowing walk-off home runs. How did the Diamondbacks win their title? By starting Schilling in Games 1, 4 and 6 \u2014 the latter two both on short rest \u2014 and using Johnson, who had won Game 5, to close Game 6 on no days\u2019 rest and snuff the Yanks.\n\nThere\u2019s every kind of swashbuckle flare to this Nats plan. The Dodgers are playing a long game. They desperately want to win their first World Series since 1988 and are bitterly stung by losing the past two. They make their pitching plans for the whole month of October because, seriously, who\u2019s going to beat them and their 106 regular-season wins? No need for unorthodox scallywag behavior. Keep everyone fresh and healthy.\n\nBut the Nats, who never have gotten past the first round of the playoffs, have decided to give no quarter, throw their best at the Dodgers day after day and, if they somehow reach the League Championship Series, they\u2019ll figure it out when the time comes. If they can clear their heads after more dancing and grog-spraying.\n\nIs this honorable, may-the-best-man-win behavior? Indeed it\u2019s not \u2014 and bravo.\n\nFor the curious, on Sunday and Monday the Nats will be trying to blow down the Dodgers on South Capital Street. In Game 4, expect to see Scherzer, who threw 93 pitches in his wild-card start Tuesday, come back after just two days\u2019 rest following his blow-the-men-down relief performance in Game 2.\n\nIf all this leaves the Dodgers stunned and worried, and it surely did, with their analytics in a shredded heap for a day, with their home-field advantage now gone, then all the better. No one in L.A. can figure out what the Nats\u2019 master plan is, or if they even have one. But they do know that Strasburg \u2014 who pitched three shutout innings of relief Tuesday, then dominated the Dodgers with 10 strikeouts in six innings for the Game 2 win Friday \u2014 surely will be lined up on full rest for a potential Game 5.\n\nWith a career postseason ERA of 0.64 with just one run allowed and 14 strikeouts in nine innings so far this October, everyone in MLB knows what that means for the Dodgers: Don\u2019t Let The Nats Get To Game 5! Strasburg is approaching the October mystique of names such as Bob Gibson, Orel Hershiser, Jack Morris and Madison Bumgarner.\n\n[Clayton Kershaw falls short of his own absurdly high standard in playoff clash with Stephen Strasburg]\n\nOne man seemed to grasp the nefarious nature of the Nats pranks here in Game 2: Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts. Asked if the Dodgers were surprised to see Scherzer run in from the bullpen, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nWhat is the most extreme usage you\u2019ve ever seen of starting pitchers in relief roles in a playoff series, he was asked.\n\nRoberts didn\u2019t have to think long. \u201cLast year in the World Series,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would be the five-game series that the Red Sox won by using David Price twice as a starter and once as a closer, Chris Sale once as a starter and once in relief and Eduardo Rodriguez twice in relief and once as a starter.\n\nIf the Nats are trying to remind the Dodgers of a very recent, very bad experience, they\u2019re doing the job.\n\nThe Nats, with all their shenanigans, are still underdogs in this series. But don\u2019t tell themthat. They\u2019re all aboard for massive mischief.\n\nFor two fun and probably crazy days in Nats Park, when you see action in the Nats bullpen, just think, \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d You never know who may be coming out. But if it\u2019s one of the Nats\u2019 Big Three, he might just be humming, \u201cBlow, blow, blow the man down.\u201d", "description": "Washington appears set on masking its bullpen issues by leaning on its three high-priced starters in a variety of roles.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist", "October At Am", "Tom Boswell Has Been A Washington Post Sports Columnist Since He Started At The Post In As A Copy Aide", "He Spent Years As A General-Assignment Reporter", "Covering Baseball", "Golf", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/793PX1BYpyYTykUobX0QI011fk8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XKXP6GHHMUI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
