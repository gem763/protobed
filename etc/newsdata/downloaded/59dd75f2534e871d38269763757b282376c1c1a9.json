He threw his arms around his wife, who was waiting for him at the end, then let a throng of supporters hoist him into the air.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the happiest man,\u201d said Kipchoge, a Kenyan flag draped over his shoulders. \u201cNo human is limited. You can do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDespite being the fastest marathon ever recorded, Kipchoge\u2019s time won\u2019t count as an official world record because the run didn\u2019t take place in an open event. The challenge, backed by the British chemical company Ineos, was held on a closed 6-mile course in a park in the Austrian capital, and Kipchoge was aided in the run by more than three-dozen pacemakers who rotated in and out several at a time throughout the race.\n\nAD\n\nBut the milestone in athletic achievement, long considered impossible, reverberated around the world Saturday morning. In Eldoret, Kenya, where Kipchoge lives with his wife and three children, a massive crowd danced and cheered in the street in celebration of their hometown hero\u2019s accomplishment.\n\nMeanwhile in Eldoret, Kenya, this is how they celebrated @EliudKipchoge becoming the first man to run a sub two-hour marathon. \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddea\ud83d\ude4c#INEOS159 #NoHumanIsLimited\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/eRnD22sqgu \u2014 INEOS 1:59 Challenge (@INEOS159) October 12, 2019\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta congratulated Kipchoge in a statement posted to Twitter. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it, you\u2019ve made history and made Kenya proud while at it,\u201d Kenyatta said. \u201cYour win today, will inspire tens of future generations to dream big and to aspire for greatness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Vienna, four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal, it\u2019s fantastic, it\u2019s just incredible to watch him \u2014 it looks like he\u2019s not even breathing. He\u2019s just gliding over the road. It\u2019s fantastic to be here, and be part of this atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHISTORY... LEGEND,\u201d tweeted British soccer legend Rio Ferdinand.\n\nKipchoge set an official marathon world record in Berlin in 2018, completing the race in 2 hours, 1 minute and 39 seconds. That record still stands.\n\nThis is his second attempt to break the two-hour mark. His first came in 2017 in a closed run in Monza, Italy, but he fell short by 26 seconds.\n\nAs his run Saturday unfolded, Kipchoge appeared poised to shatter the barrier, clocking an even pace kilometer by kilometer. With six kilometers to go, he was still 10 seconds inside his target time, the BBC reported.\n\nAD\n\nAs Kipchoge entered his last few hundred meters, the pacemakers dropped off and Kipchoge started flashing thumbs-up to the crowd.\n\nIn crossing the two-hour threshold, Kipchoge joins the ranks of British runner Roger Bannister, who made history in 1954 when he became the first person to run a mile in less than 4 minutes \u2014 an achievement which, like Kipchoge\u2019s, was once viewed as unattainable.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt has taken 65 years for a human to make history in sport after Roger Bannister made history in 1954,\u201d Kipchoge said at the finish line. \u201cI\u2019m expecting more of the athletes in all of the world to run under two hours after today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can make this world a beautiful world and a peaceful world,\u201d Kipchoge added, according to the BBC. \u201cMy wife and three children, I am happy for them to come and witness history.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge made history in Vienna, clocking in at 1 hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZUSBFto_X4ztz1O20aOvuVttkO0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCL7R5XMZII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
