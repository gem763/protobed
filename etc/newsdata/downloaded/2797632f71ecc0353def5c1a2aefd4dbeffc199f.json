The rookie continued the pressure in the ninth, singling to help load the bases and set up Murphy\u2019s free pass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been cool, man, been cool,\u201d Lewis said of his first week. \u201cJust trying to see how things go, get in the flow of it and give it my best shot every day. It\u2019s been a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nThe Mariners batted around twice, scoring five runs in the fourth and eighth innings. The late-inning rally wiped out an eight-run fifth by Chicago that included Wellington Castillo\u2019s grand slam.\n\nThe win came a day after former White Sox catcher Omar Narvaez hit a questioned, game-ending home run for a 2-1 win in 10 innings. There was no question about Lewis\u2019 drive to straightaway center field on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of the big hit we needed to get us back in the ballgame,\u201d Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \u201cAfter that, we picked up the momentum and took it from there.\u201d\n\nMallex Smith tied it at 10 with a single that scored pinch-runner Keon Broxton from second base.\n\nRuiz (1-3) gave up a single to Austin Nola, who had four hits, to open the ninth. Lewis singled and right fielder Ryan Cordell bobbled the ball, allowing Nola to move to third. He was replaced by pinch-runner Braden Bishop. After an intentional walk to load the bases, Ruiz walked Tom Murphy on six pitches.\n\n\u201cTom Murphy did a great job at the end of the game,\u201d Servais said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t try to be the hero, just have a good at-bat.\u201d\n\nAustin Adams (2-2) struck out Chicago\u2019s top three batters in the ninth for the win. He got Tim Anderson and Yoan Moncada on three pitches each.\n\nLewis has been a big part of the offense since joining the team last Tuesday from Double-A Arkansas. He became the second major leaguer to hit home runs in his first three games and broke up no-hitters with the first two blasts.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 right fielder, taken 11th overall in the 2016 draft, finished his first week in the majors 8 for 25. He\u2019s the first Mariners player with four home runs and nine RBIs in his first six games.\n\nLewis\u2019 home run and Murphy\u2019s walk wiped away an eight-run fifth inning for Chicago that eventually bloom to a 10-5 lead. It was the biggest inning for the Sox since May 2017. Castillo\u2019s slam was his second of the season and third of his career. He finished with a career-high five RBIs. Adam Engel hit a three-run home run in the inning as well.\n\nChicago\u2019s seven pitchers didn\u2019t fare as well, though, issuing a season-high 11 walks.\n\n\u201cThose are things that we have to certainly clean up in general,\u201d White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. \u201cYou see what happens on a major league field. It\u2019s not easy to win on a daily basis no matter who you\u2019re playing. Nobody quits and nobody\u2019s going to feel sorry for them or us or anyone.\u201d\n\nABOUT LAST NIGHT\n\nMajor League Baseball has expressed \u201cregret\u201d over a miscommunication that resulted in Narvaez\u2019s game-ending homer.\n\nNarvaez hit a ball off the top of the wall in the bottom of the 10th inning that was ruled a home run by umpires. The ball did not clear the fence, and had a replay review been conducted, Narvaez would have been awarded a double and the game would have continued tied at 1. There was confusion over which elements of the play Renteria wanted to challenge. There was also concern that Narvaez may have missed home plate.\n\n\u201cIn last night\u2019s game there was conversation between the umpires and the White Sox as to the procedure for potentially reviewing two different aspects of the game-ending play,\u201d MLB said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThere was then a misinterpretation regarding Chicago\u2019s desire to have any aspect of the play reviewed. We regret that this miscommunication resulted in not reviewing the home run call on the field.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMariners: OF/DH Domingo Santana (right elbow strain) will be available to the team beginning Tuesday at Pittsburgh. While he\u2019ll be on the lineup card, Servais said he\u2019d probably be used on a spot basis since it\u2019s been several weeks since he\u2019s played.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhite Sox: RHP Reynaldo Lopez (9-13, 5.35 ERA) will take the mound at Minnesota on Monday.\n\nMariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (15-11, 4.30 ERA) will seek to extend his career high for victories when Seattle visits Pittsburgh on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Lewis has walked into the major leagues and made things look easy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Talbott"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/white_soxs_mariners_baseball_23943_c0-463-3817-2688_s1770x1032.jpg?6ee84607a137a79bcec1a3b241081b1ba9c51407", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
