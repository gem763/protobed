It was late, and Harriet and Stephen \u2014 clinical psychologists at the world-renowned Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan. \u2014 were watching a movie in bed. Why wasn\u2019t Ben asleep? they wanted to know. In a casual tone, he told them he\u2019d had an accident: Some gum had fallen out of his mouth while he was going potty. So had he cleaned it up? they asked. When he didn\u2019t respond, Harriet switched on the bedside light and beckoned him over. It took her a moment to figure out what she was looking at.\n\n\u201cHe was standing there completely naked, and he\u2019d wrapped his penis in chewing gum,\u201d she told me recently. \u201cHe\u2019d somehow managed to cover his entire penis in gum.\u201d\n\nWe were barreling down a stretch of highway toward Lawrence, a university town in northeastern Kansas, where Harriet and Stephen have lived for the past 17 years. It was late August, and Ben, together with his older brother, Matt, and their wives and children, were in town for a visit.\n\n\u201cEven his balls were covered, right?\u201d Matt called out from behind the wheel of the rented minivan.\n\n\u201cTotally covered,\u201d Harriet confirmed.\n\nIn \u201cThe Topeka School,\u201d Lerner\u2019s extraordinary new novel, the story of the chewing gum is recounted by Jane Gordon, a fictionalized version of the author\u2019s mother. Like Harriet, Jane is a therapist at a leading psychiatric clinic and a best-selling author. When her son, Adam \u2014 Lerner\u2019s alter ego \u2014 pays her and her husband, Jonathan, a night visit with his gum-encased genitals, she has recently shot to fame with the publication of a book about women\u2019s anger.1 It isn\u2019t hard to see why it has struck a chord. Reagan is in office, the backlash against the second wave of feminism is in full swing and Jane has begun to receive anonymous phone calls from aggrieved men, analog precursors of today\u2019s digital trolls. \u201cThere were variations on the theme of rape,\u201d she tells us. \u201cI\u2019m going to rape you; Somebody should rape you; You were probably raped; If you weren\u2019t so ugly, you\u2019d get raped.\u201d Jane suspects that Adam has been listening in on these calls and worries they may be doing lasting damage to his psyche. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; but a penis wrapped in gum is never just a penis wrapped in gum. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it was a kind of simulated castration thing, an attempt not to be a boy, a man, one of the Men,\u201d says Jane, ever the analyst.\n\n\u201cThe Men\u201d are her anonymous callers, but as it\u2019s repeated throughout Lerner\u2019s novel, the term comes to stand for something larger \u2014 a gathering storm of white male fury. Those who live in present-day America will know how this story ends, or at least where it\u2019s headed: The Men who once abused Jane over the phone in a trembling whisper now speak in a deafening collective voice. That the young Adam Gordon, the son of Jewish intellectuals, will not end up among their ranks would seem to be a foregone conclusion, and yet part of the power of \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d \u2014 the best book yet by the most talented writer of his generation \u2014 is its ability to make everything feel up for grabs. As the title suggests, it is a novel about schooling, formal and otherwise; about how we learn to speak the way we do; and about how, as individuals and as a nation, we might learn to speak differently.\n\nAt 40, Lerner has already overachieved in two genres. His three books of poetry and two previous novels won him a MacArthur Fellowship (the \u201cgenius\u201d grant)2 in 2015. Two years later, Granta put him on its list of Best Young American Novelists. When I first met him in Brooklyn earlier this summer, he and his wife, Ariana Mangual, a professor of Urban Education at the CUNY Graduate Center, were about to buy a house in Kensington, not far from Brooklyn College, where Lerner teaches English and creative writing.\n\nBen Lerner in 1990 with his parents and grandmother, Rose Goldhor, in Topeka, Kan., reading a proclamation designating March 27 \u201cDr. Harriet Goldhor Lerner Day.\u201d From Steve Lerner\n\nThe couple has two young daughters. As it does for many people, parenthood not only brought back memories of his own childhood, but also gave Lerner new imaginative access to what that time must have been like for his mother and father. A few years ago, he found himself ventriloquizing younger versions of his parents, coastal transplants who arrive in Topeka for postdoctoral fellowships in the early 1970s and end up staying for four decades. A design began to take shape: the parts of a novel narrated by Jonathan and Jane would be interwoven with third-person sections from Adam\u2019s point of view, forming a kind of narrative rondo in which each character\u2019s experience is refracted and reconfigured by the others.\n\nSomething similar was happening in the minivan on the way to Lawrence. A few minutes earlier we\u2019d made a pit stop at the largest gas station I\u2019d ever seen,3 and Lerner had returned from the convenience store with a pack of Juicy Fruit, which prompted him to begin recounting the gum story from his childhood. As a teenager, he excelled at competitive debate, and he remains a formidable talker \u2014 fluent, composed and quick on his feet. He had no first-person memory of the gum incident, he said, only the euphemistic account he gave his parents afterward: The gum had fallen out of his mouth and \u201cgot stuck\u201d on his body.\n\n\u201cSteve and I were laughing so much,\u201d Harriet recalled, picking up the anecdote. \u201c \u2018It got stuck!\u2019 As though the whole thing had been an accident!\u201d\n\nThe laughter stopped when they realized the gum wasn\u2019t coming loose.\n\n\u201cHow did you get it off?\u201d one of Lerner\u2019s nephews asked from the third-row seat. (His daughters, along with his wife and father, were riding in a separate car.)\n\nLerner was sitting in the middle row. He has a solid, looming frame, though his rectangular glasses and short-sleeve button-downs dispel any hint of swagger or bravado. Then there is the matter of his eyebrows: dramatically arched, with a kind of gothic intensity, they resemble the birds in Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cWheatfield With Crows\u201d and give him a look of permanent surprise or alarm. Slowly twisting his neck around the headrest, he looked his nephew in the eye and, in a house-of-horrors voice, replied: \u201cIt\u2019s still there!\u201d\n\nNot so long ago, the big, ambitious social novel, the novel that wanted to tell us about \u201cthe way we live now\u201d or \u201cthe state of the nation\u201d \u2014 the novel as exemplified by Don DeLillo\u2019s \u201cUnderworld\u201d (1997) or Jonathan Franzen\u2019s \u201cThe Corrections\u201d (2001) \u2014 enjoyed a prestige and cultural centrality that, in recent years, have come to seem distinctly suspect. Looking increasingly through the lens of identity, some critics have begun to see the universalizing impulse behind such books \u2014 their belief in their ability to write across differences of race and class and gender \u2014 as presumptuous if not outright aggressive, a kind of epistemological gate-crashing (especially when the author is a well-off white man). One result of this development is that readers have become skeptical when a novel about, say, a white Midwestern family bills itself, and is celebrated as, a novel about America at large. Another result is a spike in books of radical imaginative humility, in which a first-person narrator \u2014 usually a more or less transparent proxy for the author \u2014 disavows altogether the power to represent the wider world or inhabit the hearts and minds of others. Instead, these novels, by authors like Sheila Heti and Jenny Offill, center on a richly turbulent subjectivity, a welcome corrective to manly bloat and overreach.\n\nThe name for this kind of book is \u201cautofiction,\u201d4 and in the early 2010s Lerner emerged as one if its most gifted exponents. The character Adam Gordon will already be familiar to readers of \u201cLeaving the Atocha Station\u201d (2011), Lerner\u2019s very funny debut novel, where he appears as a rudderless young poet on a fellowship in Madrid.\n\nCallow, lazy and insecure, Adam spends a lot of time in museums fretting over his inability to feel absorbed or transported by what\u2019s on the walls.5 He invests most of his creative energies not in composing the \u201clong, research-driven poem\u201d about the Spanish Civil War he has supposedly come to Spain to write (an instance of white male overreach if ever there was one) but in constructing a persona he hopes will make him alluring to the locals. His parents don\u2019t appear in the book, but they are briefly mentioned when, in desperate bids to impress the two women he\u2019s been orbiting, he says, falsely, that his mother has just died and that his father (\u201cgentlest of men\u201d) is a fascist.\n\nLerner never intended to write a novel, and some would question whether that label adequately describes what he produced. His ambition since high school had been to write poems \u2014 though some would question whether that label adequately describes the contents of his three books of verse, published between 2004 and 2010.6 Surreal and obscene, a patter of references high and low, Lerner\u2019s \u201cpoems\u201d sounded like the death throes of a cyborg implanted with the memory of a comp-lit grad student.7 The books won him critical acclaim, as well as a steady income in the form of teaching jobs. It was during a stint in Pittsburgh with Mangual, whom he\u2019d dated since their freshman year at Brown, that Lerner began to reflect on his own time in Madrid, where he, too, had spent a year on a fellowship in his early 20s. One morning at the Prado Museum he\u2019d seen a man burst into tears before an old painting. Thinking it might become a prose poem or a critical essay, he wrote up an account of the episode, and the self-doubt it had inspired in him. Lerner had decided to devote his life to art, but had he ever had an aesthetic experience of comparable magnitude? Was his failure to be moved by the same painting, or by other paintings to the same degree, a sign of fraudulence or deficiency? Or was the man just having a nervous breakdown? Scenes from Madrid continued to return to him, and within a few months he\u2019d completed a draft of something that he still hesitated to call a novel.\n\nIf, as many critics remarked upon its release, the book didn\u2019t read like fiction, that was hardly surprising. Lerner writes prose like a poet,8 zeroing in on the supposedly \u201cunnarratable\u201d parts of life that get left out of most contemporary novels (of which, he told me, he had read very few at the time): walking aimlessly around a foreign city, getting high on a park bench, endlessly refreshing The New York Times home page. The idea that Adam might try to describe anything more ambitious \u2014 that he might somehow manage to produce an epic historical poem \u2014 is clearly a nonstarter; just getting through a basic conversation in Spanish is often beyond his abilities. This is the source of much of the book\u2019s humor. \u201cShe began to say something either about the moon, the effect of the moon on the water, or was using the full moon to excuse Miguel or the evening\u2019s general drama, though the moon wasn\u2019t full\u201d is a typically equivocal sentence. This is a long way from the expansive social novels of earlier times; Adam barely grasps what\u2019s going on under his own nose.\n\nWhen \u201cLeaving the Atocha Station\u201d appeared from Coffee House Press (a small, independent outfit), it received lavish praise and soon acquired classic status among a certain cohort of literary readers. His advance had been $3,000. For his next novel, \u201c10:04\u201d (2014), Farrar, Straus and Giroux paid him a \u201cstrong six-figure\u201d advance, a detail we learn within the text itself. This time, the narrator is named Ben. He has recently published a critically acclaimed novel and finds himself having to navigate the social blowback that comes from being mistaken for, or conflated with, his book\u2019s far-from-appealing protagonist.\n\nLerner (left) with brother, Matt, in Phoenix in the early 1980s. Steve Lerner\n\nSome have complained that Lerner only writes about one thing \u2014 himself \u2014 but this is imprecise: In these novels, introspection is a means, not an end. He treats the self like an archive of social data from which it is possible to construct a larger story about our times. Stocking up on supplies at Whole Foods in the hours before Hurricane Irene is set to hit New York, Ben is suddenly transfixed by a container of instant coffee: With planes grounded and highways closed by the coming storm, he finds himself newly sensitized to the labor \u2014 the harvesting, grinding, soaking, packaging and transportation \u2014 concealed within the commodity. Irene soon passes, leaving the city largely unscathed, but the specter of collapse it raises, however fleetingly, entrains an awareness that the way things are is neither permanent nor necessary. The book is rooted in the narrator\u2019s subjectivity, but it keeps returning to instances of collective participation, from Occupy Wall Street to the fleeting solidarity of those afflicted by extreme weather.\n\nWith its broad social canvas, polyphonic narrative structure and manifest desire to tell a story about not just one man\u2019s consciousness but an entire nation, \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d sees Lerner moving into unexpected new territory. The book at once diagnoses and puts forth a possible solution to a central problem of fiction today. The social novel sets out to speak for others but often merely speaks over them. Autofiction, with its resolution to speak only for the authorial self, risks dead-ending in solipsism. Lerner\u2019s escape hatch is a kind of synthesis, a narrative mode that dares to imagine the inner lives of other people while at the same time foregrounding how such efforts are always faulty and provisional, riddled with blind spots.\n\n\u201cAnything a white male writes is going to be disfigured by that subject position,\u201d he told me. But this wasn\u2019t a call for such writers to down tools \u2014 just to stop thinking of themselves as transhistorical human subjects. \u201cI wanted to avoid the bad version of the critique of white male universality,\u201d Lerner continued. \u201cWhich is, \u2018We\u2019ve learned our lesson, universality is impossible, so there\u2019s no point in even testing which parts of consciousness are shareable.\u2019 And that was something I felt now more than ever that I needed to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Topeka School\u201d is the story of a family, the Gordons, but it is also the story of a voice \u2014 that of the novel itself. As a teenager in Topeka in the mid-1990s, Adam Gordon serves as the book\u2019s protagonist; but as a grown-up, a married man with two daughters, in present-day Brooklyn, he doubles as its narrator. Topeka Adam looks forward to a future from which his adolescent experiences can be \u201crecounted with great irony,\u201d but Brooklyn Adam looks back on him with emotional and intellectual investments his former self could not have anticipated. His goal, he says in an aside, is to trace a \u201cgenealogy of his speech.\u201d In doing so, he uncovers a larger story about public speech in America and its debasement at the hands of people not unlike himself.\n\nThe novel opens in the fall of 1996, when Adam is a high-school senior and Bob Dole is about to be crushed by Bill Clinton at the polls \u2014 a resounding confirmation, it seems at the time, that cultural conservatism is on the wane. An aspiring poet and competitive debater whose gift for words extends to freestyle rap battles,9 Adam is enduring an identity crisis. Even his hair \u2014 drawn into a ponytail but shaved at the sides in \u201ca disastrous tonsorial compromise between the lefty household of his parents and the red state in which he was raised\u201d \u2014 bears the marks of struggle.\n\nIf poetry renders Adam suspiciously effete in the eyes of his peers, then debate offers a forum in which to flex his masculine will to domination. Employing a tactic known as \u201cthe spread,\u201d he bombards the other side with more arguments than they can respond to in the allotted time, the rule being that a \u201cdropped argument,\u201d its quality notwithstanding, counts as an argument conceded. People complain that the spread divorces policy debate from the real world, that nobody \u2014 \u201csave perhaps for auctioneers\u201d \u2014 uses language in this maniacally accelerated fashion. But, as it\u2019s pointed out, corporations use a version of it all the time: in the rapid-fire warnings at the end of prescription-drug commercials, in the reams of fine print from insurance companies and banks.\n\nThe world of competitive speech is portrayed, persuasively, as a school for future elites, a place where the next generation\u2019s politicians and corporate personnel learn how to wield language for coercive and deceitful ends. One of the book\u2019s plot arcs concerns Adam\u2019s quest for victory in the extemporaneous-speech category at the national championships. His coach is a young man named Peter Evanson who, Brooklyn Adam interjects from the future, will go on to play a key role in \u201cthe most right-wing governorship Kansas has ever known,\u201d that of Sam Brownback \u2014 \u201can important model for the Trump administration.\u201d Evanson tells Adam to leaven his virtuosic command of policy details with \u201cquick swerves into the folksy\u201d:\n\nI want you saying, right after some hyper-eloquent riff about Yeltsin breaking a promise, \u201cNow, in Kansas, we call that a lie.\u201d After you go off about a treaty regulating drilling in the Arctic: \u201cNow, in Kansas, we wouldn\u2019t shake on that.\u201d I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re not real sayings, just deliver them like they\u2019re tried-and-true. Say \u201ctried-and-true.\u201d\n\nAdam takes the message on board, and is duly crowned national champion. For America, the consequences are less sanguine.\n\n\u201cKarl Rove\u2019s insight was that if you say a lot of dumb [expletive] and don\u2019t make much sense, people will identify you as a populist, even if you\u2019re a spoiled Yale rich kid,\u201d Lerner said one evening in late June. We\u2019d met at a bar in Prospect Heights to watch the second debate of the Democratic primary season. Throngs of 20- and 30-somethings in oversized T-shirts and cuffed pants sat around beer-garden picnic tables, their eyes trained on a projection screen at the end of the room. Hunched over a glass of pale German beer, Lerner took in the debate proceedings with the dispassionate scrutiny of a veteran public speaker, remarking on niceties of technique or missed rhetorical opportunities. He was encouraged by the leftward tilt of some of the field, but worried that a progressive Democrat speaking a language grounded in policy specifics would struggle against a Republican incumbent who used words for altogether different purposes. \u201cTrump\u2019s genius, which is indistinguishable from a kind of idiocy,\u201d he said, \u201chas been to do a dozen world-historically scandalous things a day while at the same time speaking in this slow, contentless, gestural language that appeals to people\u2019s sense of being spread.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d is making what sounds like a bold argument \u2014 that the seeds of our contemporary malaise were present in the language games that Adam played as a teenager \u2014 it is doing so tentatively, without the rhetorical bluster and aggression of its adolescent protagonist. It is an ambitious book that is also engagingly anxious about its own ambition. Brooklyn Adam hovers over the text like a ghostly presence, occasionally interrupting his otherwise seamless account of his own past to draw out an irony or, in the sections voiced by his parents, to ask a question or clarify a point. These glitches in the narrative flow aren\u2019t part of a metafictional game, a redundant reminder that what we\u2019re reading is all made up; they are Lerner\u2019s way of dramatizing his lack of confidence in his ability to speak for others, let alone the country as a whole. In a disturbing current-day coda, Adam and his family attend an anti-ICE protest in Manhattan. When a cop orders him to tell one of his daughters to stop drawing with chalk on the sidewalk, Adam says his children barely listen to him. \u201cDo you have kids?\u201d he asks the cop. \u201cBecause I have no authority, is what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d It is also what Lerner is trying to say, with moving sincerity, throughout the book.\n\nThe true measure of Lerner\u2019s success in \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d \u2014 of his ambition to write beyond the self and explore \u201cwhat parts of consciousness are shareable\u201d \u2014 lies in the depth and vitality of Adam\u2019s parents. Jane, in particular, is an astonishing creation; it is hard to think of another character in recent fiction who shows up so vividly on the page. The essence of her personality is her pragmatic intelligence, the grace and ingenuity with which she faces down the trials of her professional life at the Foundation, where \u201cobjecting to the diagnosis of penis envy was a sure sign of penis envy.\u201d When the Men call to harass her in the evenings, Jane pretends she can\u2019t hear them, and asks that they speak up: \u201cTypically what would happen is that the guy would repeat, confused, whatever he\u2019d said a little more loudly, and while I could hear him fine, I would say, equally politely, betraying no knowledge of the nature of the call, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not a great connection, can you be a little louder?\u2019 \u201d The callers grow self-conscious, embarrassed by the sound of their own voices, and hang up.\n\nJane\u2019s biggest source of worry may be Adam himself, who she fears is absorbing the worst kinds of masculine behavior. When she asks him to tidy his room, he attempts to \u201cspread\u201d her with a barrage of arguments \u2014 \u201cabout her nagging, her hypocrisy, her failure to abide by the precepts she laid out in her books, her bizarre focus on conventional domestic order over the autonomy of others.\u201d She responds by modeling a different kind of language, a sort of antispread: speech as a means of self-knowledge and authentic connection. The book thus embodies a poignant reciprocity.10 The grown-up Adam foregrounds the fact that Jane\u2019s voice is his creation or reconstruction. At the same time, \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d makes it clear that Adam\u2019s voice \u2014 the supple, responsive, many-minded voice of the novel itself \u2014 was in large part shaped by that of his mother.\n\nLerner with his mother in the early 1980s in Topeka, Kan. Steve Lerner\n\nThis reciprocity extends beyond the frame of the novel. Long before Lerner began to fictionalize his own experience, he was already a character in Harriet\u2019s work. \u201cThe Mother Dance,\u201d11 her book on raising children, doesn\u2019t stint on anecdotes about her two sons and the intergenerational power struggles that were a defining feature of their household (although it does omit the story of the chewing gum, something Ben explicitly requested). At age 10, we learn, Ben announced that he wanted to get his ear pierced. Harriet said no, inaugurating a lengthy filial pressure campaign. There follows a very funny portrait of the artist as a young mansplainer: \u201cThen Ben pulled out all the stops to construct a major feminist case. His key point was that I lacked integrity because I fought against constricting gender roles on the public front while I perpetuated them at home.\u201d\n\nLerner was a freshman at Brown when the book was published, in 1998. He\u2019d opted not to read the manuscript, but the week it came out he called his mother in a frantic state and asked her to overnight him a copy. \u201cIt suddenly became much more real to him that he was in it,\u201d Harriet told me. \u201cHe thought there would be all sorts of shameful, humiliating things in there. You know, people basically don\u2019t want to be written about, even if it\u2019s favorable, because they have their own story and their own way of viewing it.\u201d A few days after she sent the book, a bunch of flowers appeared on her doorstep. They were from Ben, and Matt, who also went to Brown. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d said the card. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done it without us!\u201d\n\nWithout Harriet and Stephen, Ben certainly could not have written \u201cThe Topeka School,\u201d a book about inheritance, about the \u201crepetitions just beneath the threshold of consciousness.\u201d His parents discussed the project with him at length as he was writing it, going over their memories of his childhood and reading multiple drafts. Neither of them objected to being used as models. \u201cHe was very worried we were going to be upset,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cUp until the very end he would say, \u2018I will scrap this book, I\u2019ll delete the whole book if it\u2019s going to hurt you.\u2019 \u201d They insisted it wouldn\u2019t. Harriet and Stephen came from families in which certain subjects \u2014 a parent\u2019s cancer, for one \u2014 had been strictly off limits, and they responded by creating a climate of honesty and openness with their own children. They made no secret, for example, of the fact that they hadn\u2019t planned to have a second child, even if his arrival came as a welcome surprise. Sometimes, when the brothers fought, Ben would taunt Matt for being colorblind. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a broken condom!\u201d Matt would shout back.\n\nA determination to intervene in old patterns and create new ones is, for Ben, a common denominator of both therapy and fiction. \u201cThere\u2019s this really intimate relation between my understanding of why my parents do the work they do and my understanding of what it means to write a novel,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot because writing fiction is supposed to be palliative, but because aesthetic form is about making conscious pattern, and having kids meant that this was a moment when aesthetic questions of patterning acquired a new urgency for me.\u201d\n\nOn my second day in Kansas, the Lerners took me to see Topeka, a half-hour drive from Lawrence, where Harriet and Stephen moved the year before the Menninger Foundation relocated to Houston in 2003. (They are now both in private practice.) As we rolled into town, the family pointed out various landmarks. For Ben and Matt, every street corner seemed to bring back the memory of some childhood ordeal.\n\n\u201cThis is where I sustained head trauma,\u201d Ben said matter-of-factly as we passed a football field. \u201cMy parents let me play even after I\u2019d had two concussions.\u201d The boys\u2019 middle school scrolled by. \u201cWe both spent two years there trying not to get beaten up,\u201d said Matt. This reminded Ben of his first migraine. \u201cThis kid, who I think was later murdered, came up to me in the hall while I was going to the nurse\u2019s office.\u201d He asked what Ben was doing; Ben said he was sick. \u201cThen he kneed me in the stomach and threw me up against the wall and said, \u2018Now you\u2019re sick, you pussy.\u2019 \u201d Everyone in the car laughed.\n\nOver burgers at an old-style diner with red vinyl booths and checkered flooring, Ben was keen to stress his lasting affection for Topeka, where many of his closest friendships began. (The acknowledgments page of the new novel is filled with their names.) I asked Harriet if, like Jane Gordon, she\u2019d ever worried that Ben would turn out to be one of the Men.\n\n\u201cNo, what I worried about was that he\u2019d always be a debater and not really be able to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I often listen,\u201d said Ben, impersonating a defensively sarcastic teenager. \u201cI\u2019ve listened on several occasions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has,\u201d Harriet said.\n\n\u201cI was horribly argumentative,\u201d Ben went on, in earnest now. \u201cI could be a real bully, verbally. It was my way of being tough, of passing as a \u2018real man.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLerner wanted to be a lawyer until he discovered poetry in his midteens. The so-called New York School of John Ashbery and Frank O\u2019Hara was especially formative (a debt acknowledged in the new book\u2019s title). The playful, suggestive incoherence of such writers offered a kind of antidote to the zero-sum hostility of debate. Late on in \u201cThe Topeka School,\u201d Adam, now a college freshman visiting New York, suffers a nervous breakdown during an Ashbery reading at the 92nd Street Y. It\u2019s a frightening scene.
