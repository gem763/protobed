Samardzija had his worst start of the season and the Giants were in a tailspin.\n\nHe and the team righted things Friday night, beating Clayton Kershaw and the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers 5-4.\n\n\u201cI pride myself on September,\u201d Samardzija said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like how it started and just really need to get back to the drawing board. We were a lot better out there.\u201d\n\nMauricio Dub\u00f3n went 3 for 4 and drove in three runs in the series opener.\n\nThe Giants ended a stretch in which they lost eight of 10 and 12 of 16 on a night when retiring manager Bruce Bochy was honored by the Dodgers in a pre-game ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis is, honestly, since I\u2019ve been here, one of Boch\u2019s best years with dealing with a short starting staff, trading away half the bullpen and doing some different things,\u201d Samardzija said. \u201cTo keep everyone positive and fighting and playing hard, he\u2019s done an amazing job this year.\u201d\n\nBochy\u2019s record against Los Angeles improved to 219-204 in stints as manager of the Giants and San Diego Padres.\n\nKershaw (13-5) lost his third straight start for the first time since 2015 for the Dodgers, whose four-game winning streak ended.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excuses I can come up with in my head,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cJust need to pitch better.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers pulled to 5-4 with two outs in the ninth on A.J. Pollock\u2019s third homer of the game, a towering shot to left field on the first pitch from closer Will Smith. They have 253 homers on the season, already a NL record.\n\nSmith walked pinch-hitter Russell Martin to put the tying run on base. Smith then struck out catcher Will Smith to end the game and earn his second save.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll cross paths in our career a couple more times, so we\u2019ll see who wins the Will Smith battle,\u201d Smith the catcher said.\n\nSamardzija (10-11) allowed three runs and five hits while striking out three and walking none in his previous outing. He gave up six earned runs over 5 1/3 innings against San Diego last weekend.\n\nLike Samardzija, Kershaw was coming off a disappointing outing. Last weekend at Arizona, Kershaw gave up five earned runs and five hits in five innings.\n\nThe three-time Cy Young Award winner exited after four-plus innings and 99 pitches in his shortest start of the season. He gave up three runs and seven hits - second-most of the season - struck out six and walked three.\n\nKershaw needed 17 minutes to get out of a bases-loaded jam in the first.\n\n\u201cI could see his frustration early, couldn\u2019t get into a rhythm,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cIt was a grind for him.\u201d\n\nKershaw was pulled after a leadoff single to Austin Slater and a walk to Kevin Pillar.\n\nHe spoke briefly to Roberts before leaving the mound. Kershaw reached the dugout and, in a rare display of emotion, kicked the cooler under the bench, and then tossed his glove and cap before heading into the clubhouse.\n\n\u201cI just never want to come out,\u201d Kershaw said, \u201cespecially that early in the game.\u201d\n\nDylan Floro came on and got Evan Longoria on a groundout to first before loading the bases on an intentional walk to Buster Posey. Pinch-hitter Mike Yastrzemski hit a two-run double to deep center field. After another intentional walk to Brandon Belt, Dub\u00f3n hit a two-run RBI single, extending the Giants\u2018 lead to 5-1.\n\nDub\u00f3n homered to tie the game 1-all in the fourth.\n\n\u201cHe crushed that home run,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cWhat a game he had. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a game he\u2019ll remember, first game here at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPollock slugged solo shots in the second and fifth innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: RHP Trevor Gott (right elbow strain) was transferred to the 60-day IL. \u2026 RHP Johnny Cueto, recovering from Tommy John surgery last year, will throw a bullpen session in LA this weekend to see how his back feels after experiencing tightness.\n\nDodgers: LHP Rich Hill (left forearm strain) faced hitters, tossing 33 pitches. He\u2019ll make four starts to build himself up before the postseason begins, with his first one expected to be an abbreviated outing next week at Baltimore.\n\nSTRUGGLING IN THE STRETCH\n\nThe Dodgers are 7-7 in their last 14 games, while their division lead is 17 games over Arizona.\n\n\u201cA lot of momentum all year long has been starting pitching,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe last two weeks our starters just haven\u2019t been consistent.\u201d\n\nBesides Kershaw, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Walker Buehler have tailed off recently. Those three are being counted on to pitch deep into postseason games.\n\nDODGERS ROTATION\n\nRyu will skip a start in the rotation next week at Baltimore to get some rest, Roberts said. Ryu had a major-league leading ERA of 1.45 on Aug. 11. Since then, his ERA has skied to 9.95 and he\u2019s given up five home runs in the four starts since then. Ryu had allowed just 10 in 22 starts before that.\n\nLHP Julio Ur\u00edas starts Sunday\u2019s series finale in place of RHP Walker Buehler. Ur\u00edas will be limited to three innings and about 45 pitches.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGiants: They\u2019ve lost each of the last eight starts dating to July 24 by RHP Tyler Beede (3-9, 5.61 ERA). He\u2019s 0-6 with a 7.05 ERA in those eight outings.\n\nDodgers: RHP Tony Gonsolin (2-1, 2.89) has held batters to a .200 average in six major league games, including five starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jeff Samardzija always looks forward to baseball's stretch run, even if the San Francisco Giants aren't going anywhere beyond September.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/giants_dodgers_baseball_44808_c0-141-2608-1661_s1770x1032.jpg?6440579fd96b07e939700b06e82eaca2bd5654cc", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
