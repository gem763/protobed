The youngest teams to reach the playoffs this season \u2014 the Tampa Bay Rays (28), Oakland Athletics (27.9) and Minnesota Twins (27.8) \u2014 are in the bottom half of M.L.B.\u2019s payroll rankings. The youngest teams in baseball \u2014 the San Diego Padres (25.8) were the youngest, and finished 70-92 \u2014 were rebuilding and had shed most of their more experienced, better-paid players.\n\nMany players on the Astros, one of the most unapologetically analytics-driven teams, said they would not have won the 2017 World Series without Carlos Beltran, a designated hitter who was 40 at the time and hit .231 with 14 home runs, and Brian McCann, a catcher who was 33 and hit .241 with 18 home runs. Their production wasn\u2019t commensurate with their combined salaries of $33 million, but they still added value.\n\nBeltran, who retired after that season, helped young hitters learn to game plan against opposing pitches, while McCann, who retired after two seasons later, mentored young pitchers.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a winning atmosphere,\u201d said Astros shortstop Carlos Correa, now 25 .\n\n\u201cThey gave us a lot of confidence and made us believe that we were the best team out there and had to compete like it,\u201d Correa continued. \u201cHaving veterans on the team is huge. It helped the younger guys set the tone, and to speak when they had to speak in meetings or when the team is not playing good.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals saw that firsthand this season. In late May, when they sat at 19-31, it was difficult to imagine them making the playoffs, let alone being up two games to none in the World Series against the juggernaut Astros.", "description": "The Nationals have the oldest team in the majors by average age.
