And so far, it\u2019s kind of worked.\n\nEndorsements from big names like Elon Musk, along with many small individual donations from software engineers\u2014among the biggest givers to his campaign\u2014have catapulted him into the middle of the winnowing pack of remaining Democratic candidates. He\u2019s managed to win over the tech industry\u2019s support while making its negative impact on society his central focus, and he\u2019ll be on the debate stage on Thursday night, trying to convince everyone he can fix it.\n\nAn outsider with zero political experience, Yang has outlasted a senator, two governors and three members of the House in the crowded Democratic field. He\u2019s currently beating two senators, former liberal heartthrob Beto O\u2019Rourke and Tom Steyer, the billionaire burning through his own cash while floundering in the polls. And Yang\u2019s fundraising and poll numbers were strong enough to qualify for nationally televised debates three times.\n\nBut it\u2019s the next phase that proves trickiest, in both tech and politics. Yang, who is currently at 2.5% in a Real Clear Politics aggregation of polls, needs to scale up quickly, building more name recognition and financial support before the primary season starts. In short, it\u2019s time for Yang to go public.\n\nHis plan to do so involves a campaign centered on one big idea: a $1,000 check sent monthly to every U.S. citizen over the age of 18, no strings attached. But he\u2019s also touting more than 150 other proposals such as legalizing marijuana, creating a postal banking system, paying college athletes, eliminating the penny and making Puerto Rico a state.\n\nIt\u2019s those ideas that make more traditional pundits view Yang as a fringe candidate\u2014Yang is undoubtedly the first presidential campaign to have taken a stance on circumcision, even if he later backtracked on it. But an embrace of oddball causes may also be part of the secret to Yang\u2019s success so far.\n\nConnor Farrell, a progressive fundraising consultant for Left Rising in Washington, D.C., said that Yang\u2019s campaign features the kind of niche ideas with passionate fan bases that drive online donations. Those voters can be reached much more efficiently through free viral videos and memes than can, say, potential supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden who prioritize electability. And they\u2019re easier to convert into small-dollar donors who can be tapped again and again, Farrell said.\n\n\u201cCandidates who advertise about a specific issue have an easier time targeting the people that are likely to give to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make more money spending less money.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg 2020 Presidential Candidates Speak At Iowa State Fair Soapbox\n\nYang recently sat down with Bloomberg in a cramped conference room in San Francisco to talk about his ideas. Surrounded by stacks of his book The War on Normal People, the former tech entrepreneur quickly launched into his case that the tech sector bears responsibility for many of America\u2019s problems.\n\nRetail jobs vaporizing and shopping malls closing? That\u2019s Amazon. Suicide and mental health issues on the rise? That\u2019s Facebook. Journalism on the decline? Google\u2019s ad network carries a bunch of responsibility for that.\n\nAnd, he argues, there\u2019s worse to come, as automation comes for clerical, call center, retail, food preparation and trucking jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not immigrants causing these problems,\u201d Yang said, in counterpoint to President Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nAnd then he turns to his solution, which his campaign calls the Freedom Dividend but Yang informally describes as a \u201ctech check.\u201d To help pay for its estimated cost of about $255 billion per month, he wants to ditch corporate taxes on earnings and instead institute a value-added tax, or VAT, a tax on consumption. The VAT is used by a majority of developed counties, but is considered a non-starter in the U.S. for both parties: Republicans look at it as a tax hike, and Democrats believe it\u2019s regressive because poor people\u2019s consumption represents more of their income. Yang argues that if the tax were set at 10% (or about half the amount Europe charges) it would easily cover his $12,000 annual stipend for every American.\n\nWhile Yang believes the tech sector has created a lot of problems, he also thinks it\u2019s uniquely positioned to solve some.\n\nYang wants to allow voting by mobile phone using blockchain security. He favors net neutrality, letting consumers have a property right to their own data and increased investment in quantum computing and encryption technologies. He wants to bolster artificial intelligence to remain competitive with China and create a new agency to monitor the addictive nature of smartphones and social media.\n\nAnd, more importantly, he doesn\u2019t rail against the companies\u2019 creators themselves. It\u2019s a neat trick: He vilifies the effects of innovation while absolving the innovators, saying that\u2019s a job for government regulators.\n\n\u201cThis is a natural place where the government needs to come in and set parameters,\u201d Yang told Bloomberg. \u201cIf you ask [tech companies] to self-regulate, they would literally be doing their shareholders a massive disservice if they were to scale back in any meaningful way.\u201d\n\nTo help garner support for such policies, Yang wants to create an agency to educate elected officials on artificial intelligence, data privacy, online ad networks and other technology topics they often don\u2019t understand but are expected to craft laws to regulate. Such misunderstanding, he suggests, is what led candidate Elizabeth Warren to propose a break up of big tech earlier this year.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s recommending 20th century solutions to 21st century problems,\u201d he said of Warren. \u201cIt\u2019s not like breaking Google up into four mini-Googles would somehow improve the marketplace because no one wants to use the fourth best search engine. There\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re not using Bing.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Candidates Attend Second 2020 Democratic Presidential Debates\n\nYang has early roots in the tech industry. He grew up in upstate New York, a self-described nerd who often spent more time with computers than people. His father, who worked at International Business Machines Corp. and generated 69 patents, encouraged his son\u2019s early interest in technology. After Yang earned a law degree from Columbia University, he found he didn\u2019t like being a lawyer and launched a startup allowing people to donate to celebrities\u2019 favorite charities (it failed), then he drifted to a health care startup and eventually joined an online test prep company as an employee. By the time test titan Kaplan Test Prep bought it a few years later in 2009, Yang had risen to become its chief executive. He used part of his windfall to start a non-profit called Venture For America, matching recent college graduates with tech startups in sometimes-overlooked cities like St. Louis, Detroit and Pittsburgh.\n\nThe people most likely to donate to Yang\u2019s campaign have job titles like programmer, developer and software engineer. Many of them have jobs at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but Yang also has a steady stream of contributions from workers with the same jobs at companies around the country, such as Capital One Financial Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Walmart Inc.\n\nHe's also gotten support from tech workers at small startups, ranging from companies developing artificial intelligence platforms to apps that teach \"Unified Mindfulness,\" a meditation technique.\n\nWorkers at tech firms contributed $321,664 to Yang through the end of June, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That was less than the $1.3 million the sector gave to Pete Buttigieg, tops among Democratic presidential candidates, and about as much as Joe Biden, who is polling far higher but whose late entry into the race gave him less time to raise money.\n\nLike most of his rivals, Yang's big three locations for raising money are the New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas, but tech enclaves rank higher on his list than they do for other candidates. Seattle is fourth and the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area\u2014the heart of Silicon Valley\u2014is seventh.\n\nRichard Shank is one of those donors. A software developer in Beaverton, Ore., he was working on a project to automate school scheduling and listening to a Ray Kurzweil audiobook a few years ago when he had a realization that automation was going to cause a lot more disruption to the economy.\n\nAfter reading more on the issue, Shank, 50, settled on the universal basic income\u2014sometimes called UBI, or in Yang\u2019s case, the \u201ctech check\u201d\u2014as a solution. He backed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016 in part because he\u2019d said favorable things about the idea, but when he heard Yang on Sam Harris\u2019 podcast, Shank had finally found his candidate.\n\n\u201cI was immediately sold,\u201d he said. \u201cUBI is probably the single most important issue in this race.\u201d\n\nShank listened to the audiobook of The War on Normal People and checked out every podcast interview with the Yang that he could find. He sets aside a portion of each paycheck to send to Yang\u2019s campaign, and is about $1,000 toward his goal of hitting the Federal Election Commission maximum of $2,800.\n\nNeil Malhotra, a political economy professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has studied political attitudes in Silicon Valley and the tech sector. One study of tech founders in Silicon Valley found that they favor low regulation to allow businesses to innovate but they also support redistributing wealth and are liberal on social issues. A separate study found similar attitudes among computer science majors at Stanford.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Yang campaign, it\u2019s very consistent with what we found,\u201d Malhotra said.\n\nYang may not like social media\u2019s effects on society, but his campaign is certainly benefiting from them. Online, fans have blended his image with funny and sometimes outrageous messages that spread fast on Twitter and Reddit as well as more controversial sites like 4chan. Yang\u2019s campaign staff say they try to keep tabs on the ever-multiplying memes, but have no control over what gets published, where or how fast it spreads.\n\n\u201cAs important as social media and everything is, the core driver is still email and fundraising,\u201d said Digital Director Eric Ming, who leads the campaign\u2019s efforts in social media, digital advertising, email and online engagement. He said he and his team don\u2019t generally make memes, but see the power of the images in real time.\n\nWhen a meme strikes a chord, like the image of a boyfriend doing a double take on a new girl (Yang) while walking with his girlfriend (Trump), it spreads quickly, contributing to the candidate\u2019s digital fame. One clip of Yang dancing the Cupid Shuffle in a women\u2019s exercise class got 1.6 million views. A slow-motion video of Yang standing barefoot on his deck kicking off a water bottle cap without knocking over the bottle got 1.4 million. Another video shows supporters hoisting him above their heads, enabling him to crowdsurf his political rally like a rockstar.\n\nThey may seem trivial, but like any media appearance, viral clips can drive voters to learn more about the candidate. These images play an outsized role in driving political decisions, according to Joel Penney, an associate professor at Montclair State University and author of The Citizen Marketer: Promoting Political Opinion in the Social Media Age.\n\nPenney described memes as amateur-produced political ads that played a \u201cmassive\u201d role in helping Trump win the last election. Their power, he says, lies in their simplicity. It\u2019s an easy way of consuming often complex information that\u2019s easy to share, is topical and hits emotional triggers.\n\n\u201cMemes get votes,\u201d Penney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-to-one correlation, but it\u2019s absolutely what\u2019s shaping meaning and perceptions.\u201d\n\n(Updates with donation information in the 24th paragraph.
