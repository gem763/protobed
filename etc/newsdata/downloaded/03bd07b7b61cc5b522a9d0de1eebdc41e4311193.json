Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders, are slated to plow roughly $26 trillion into climate change mitigation. Biden believes $1.7 trillion will cover the cost needed to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels, while Sanders\u2019s plan is loftier: The Vermont senator wants to spend $16.3 trillion on addressing global warming.\n\nYang\u2019s goal, which he announced in an Aug. 26 post on his website that spanned 11,000 words, would cost $4.9 trillion. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, unveiled his $3 trillion climate change plan Tuesday, which promises to expand green energy, phase out the use of fossil fuels and create a 100% carbon neutral economy by 2045.\n\nThe four men are expected to fine tune their climate message during a Sept. 4 CNN town hall.\n\nBiden wants to eliminate hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and coal production, institute a carbon tax, place a ban on new fossil fuel permits on public lands, and work for a ban on fossil fuel subsidies. He would also require companies to disclose their climate risks and emissions to induce investors to move their money out of fossil fuel companies, media reports show.\n\nSanders, for his part, is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal (GND), a piece of legislation proposed in 2019 that called for \u201c10-year national mobilizations\u201d toward a series of goals aimed at fighting global warming. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was one of the chief proponents of the GND before Republicans and Democrats voted against the legislation on March 26.\n\nStudies suggest such plans are destined to wreak havoc on the economy.\n\nEliminating fossil fuels and transitioning to a 100% renewable electric grid could cost as much as $5.2 trillion over two decades, according to a 2010 study by the conservative Heritage Foundation. That\u2019s about $218 billion to move the grid away from coal and natural gas.\n\nNot every Democrat is on board with moving pell-mell away from fossil fuels. Many mainstream Democrats are hesitant, especially those who remember the party\u2019s failed carbon tax experiment in 2010, which ultimately helped thrust them into a political wasteland after the GOP won both houses of Congress that year.\n\n\u201cMy district is very worried that Democrats are lurching to the left,\u201d Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan told Politico, referring to what she believes is Democrats\u2019 willingness to embrace an all-or-nothing position on climate change. \u201cI know AOC\u2019s face will be on every ad against me in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pragmatist, and I represent a lot of pragmatic people,\u201d said Slotkin. \u201cWhy say we need massive social change to reduce emissions? How does that build consensus?\u201d She questions why Democrats like Sanders and Booker believe universal health care and a federal job guarantee should be included in discussions about how to approach climate policies.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
