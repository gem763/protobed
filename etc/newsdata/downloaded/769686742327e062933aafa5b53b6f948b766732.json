Men all over the world are dying before their time \u2014 through suicide, prostate or testicular cancer and other ways that can be prevented. Movember aims to reduce the number of men dying prematurely by 25 percent by 2030. To honor the occasion, we've collected some of the most iconic, memorable and outlandish mustaches the world has ever seen....\n\nAward winning: Few Movember participants go to such great lengths as the contestants of the World Beard and Mustache Championships, which sees men from around the world coming together to showcase their incredible face fuzz. But since its founding in 2003, 'Mo Bros' have helped to fund more than 1,250 men's health projects around the world, focusing on the issues of prostate and testicular cancers, as well as mental health and suicide prevention.\n\nBeing Ron: Nick Offerman's character on Parks and Recreation wouldn't have been complete without his fabulously bushy mustache. Though we have seen him without it, many of Offerman's fans say they prefer him with his impressive facial fuzz.\n\nWorth a fight: Hulk Hogan is not only one of the most famous professional wrestlers of all time, he's also one of the few famous men to consistently sport his trademark blonde biker mustache. In the past, Hogan has been an ambassador for Movember in New Zealand so is a big proponent of this worthy cause.\n\nSomething to talk about: American commentator and talk show host Geraldo Rivera's career has taken its share of twists and turns, but his facial hair has remained an impressive constant. In an interview with CNN, Geraldo commented on his enduring love for the 'stache, saying: 'It takes a real man to wear a mustache in the 21st century.'\n\nChampion: Before passing away at only 45, Queen frontman Freddie Mercury made his mark with his legendary sound, flamboyant appearance \u2014 and his signature chevron-style mustache.\n\nWinning by a hair: This shot, taken in 1939, shows Mr Harry Williams, who claimed to have the longest mustache in Britain. The Movember movement started in 2003 in Melbourne, Australia with just 30 men taking part. Today, the movement has grown to upwards of six million and counting, and has raised more than $900 million for men's health issues.\n\nGrooming secrets: Lionel Richie's pyramid-style mustache has been with him through the decades. His secret to a swoon-worthy 'stache? In an interview with GQ, he said he uses his downtime to grab a magnifying mirror and tweeze his look to perfection.\n\nImportant: The Movember Foundation is the only global charity focused solely on men\u2019s health issues. It seeks to raise funds to deliver innovative, breakthrough research and support programs that enable men to live happier, healthier, and longer lives. It's also a fun, easy and impactful way to raise money and start vital conversations.\n\nHe's got the look: Prince's curving whisper-thin mustache was as much a part of his look as the color purple.\n\nMo problems: Actor Tom Selleck has one of the most loved and recognizable mustaches of all time. In fact, many Magnum P.I. fans pay homage to Tom's lip hair at the end of Movember once they have perfected the look by wearing the full Magnum outfit to raise money for the cause.\n\nLike a butterfly: Given his legacy as a civil rights icon, Rev. Martin Luther King's mustache is hardly a footnote in his history. But barber Nelson Malden says Dr. King had very specific ideas about how he wanted his facial hair to appear. 'He was more concerned about his mustache than his haircut. He always liked his mustache to be off the lip, like a butterfly,' Malden told Alabama Public Radio.\n\nMustache man: From thick and bushy to barely-there, Burt Reynolds has sported a wide variety of mustaches during his illustrious career, making the Boogie Nights star one of the most widely admired and emulated among facial-hair admirers.\n\nMo pictures please: Has anyone ever made a mustache look so good?\n\nMGM star: Clark Gable popularized the thin pencil mustache, but his own relationship with facial hair throughout his life was spotty: He shaved off and regrew his rakishly handsome 'stache several times throughout the course of his career.\n\nFamous mo: Samuel Langhorne Clemens, aka Mark Twain, sported a bushy mustache throughout his life, but had no patience for other forms of facial hair. According to the National Archives, he once said a beard 'performs no purposeful function; it is a nuisance and a discomfort.'\n\nA stroke of genius: German-born physicist Albert Einstein may be best known for his Theory of Relativity \u2014 but among facial-hair admiring circles, he's also remembered for his full, bushy mustache, which he cultivated throughout his decades-long career as a physicist.\n\nThe 'Moscars':The men who grow mustaches during the month of November are known as 'Mo Bros' and after humble beginnings in Australia and New Zealand, there are now huge events all over the world, including Taiwan, South Africa, Israel and the United States.\n\nOld boy's club: Mustaches were very much in vogue in 1950, as evidenced by this crowd of facial-hair bedecked gentlemen. Here, they look on as BBC sports commentator Raymond Glendenning measures the magnificent mustache of Glasgow artist John Roy.\n\nOut of this world: Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dali sports one of the most memorable mustaches of all time -- in fact, in 2010 his was voted the best-known 'stache in the world.\n\nWorthy cause: During the month of November, men are challenged to grow a mustache and attend or host a fundraising event to encourage people to not only donate, but have conversations about men's health issues and start life-changing conversations.\n\nLife in color: Though he is used to being behind the camera rather than in front, Walt Disney (pictured here in 1941) had a pretty rad mustache back in his hey day that many men have tried, but failed, to recreate in today's facial-hair loving society.\n\nNo grouching around: For fans at the turn of the century, Julius 'Groucho' Marx would've been practically unrecognizable without his signature mustache. During his years in vaudeville, Marx painted on a fake one with grease paint, but in his later years he grew an authentic version of this famous 'stache.\n\nMan on a mission: Long before Movember, Mahatma Gandhi sported a distinctive mustache throughout his life of civil disobedience and would surely be very supportive of all the good Movember does if he was still here today.", "description": "This month kicks off Movember, the monthly challenge that sees men around the world growing 'staches to raise awareness of men's health issues.
