Jim Jordan over Biden-Ukraine dealings", "language": "en", "text": "CNN host Jake Tapper sparred Sunday with Rep. Jim Jordan over the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump, defending former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son and his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nMr. Tapper told the Ohio Republican that the transcript of a White House call with Ukraine\u2019s president shows that Mr. Trump withheld aid to Ukraine and requested a probe into Mr. Biden and his son over a $50,000-per-month payment in connection to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that that\u2019s OK with you,\u201d Mr. Tapper told the lawmaker.\n\nThe transcript, which came to light as part of a whistleblower complaint, has been the subject of an impeachment inquiry into the president, formally launched last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHouse Democrats assert that the president was pressuring a foreign government to investigate his political rival.\n\nMr. Jordan asserted there was wrongdoing on behalf of the Bidens and their financial dealings with Ukraine while Mr. Biden was vice president.\n\nBut the CNN host pushed back, saying those charges were unfounded.\n\nMr. Jordan suggested that Mr. Biden tried to stop an investigation into his son and the company by demanding a Ukrainian prosecutor be fired.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian prosecutor said there is no evidence of wrongdoing,\u201d Mr. Tapper said.\n\nMr. Jordan said Mr. Tapper was playing \u201cgymnastics\u201d to defend the Bidens and House Democrats.\n\nMr. Jordan, the ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also defended the call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying \u201cthere\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe transcript gives you no reason to impeach this president,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, joined the CNN host after Mr. Jordan \u2019s interview, saying he was \u201coffended\u201d by the attacks Republicans are launching at Mr. Biden in defense of the president and this is a \u201c Trump scandal.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
