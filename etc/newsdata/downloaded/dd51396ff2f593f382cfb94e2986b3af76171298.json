Long-term deficiency can lead to cognitive problems.\n\nResearch suggests about 20 per cent of elderly people are B12 deficient. Although a Statistics Canada population survey published in 2013 found, on average, seniors had only slightly lower levels of B12 than younger adults.\n\nVegans and \"patients with diseases like Crohn's and colitis as well as people with pernicious anemia are also particularly vulnerable to deficiency,\" added Silverstein.\n\nThe Toronto specialist said that the price tag for a monthly shot is $44.33 \u2014 $33.70 paid to the doctor per visit, $6.74 for administering the shot and $3.89 for the vial of B12.\n\nOrally administered supplements from a big box store cost as little as $30 for a full year's supply of tablets.\n\nAnimal-based proteins are adequate sources of vitamin B12 for most people. Some seniors lose their ability to absorb the nutrient as they age and require B12 supplements.

Silverstein also said he didn't know if over-prescription was a problem in other provinces.\n\nB12's star power\n\nB12 shots have gained popularity after being used by celebrities, such as Rihanna and Katy Perry, because they're promoted as a means to boost energy levels. Injections or vitamin drips are also offered by naturopathic doctors and spas promising instant results.\n\nBut Dr. Samir Sinha, who was not involved in the research, said B12 shots can't provide \"a big boost.\"\n\n\"Getting B12 shouldn't instantly make you feel great or more powerful,\" he said. \"People who really believe that \u2026 that's the power of placebo.\"\n\nB12 \ud83d\udc89 has me like \ud83d\ude1c \u2014@katyperry\n\nAs a gerontologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Sinha said he commonly tests for B12 levels in patients \"when we're assessing a person for dementia or a person with balance issues.\"\n\nOtherwise he said it's ineffective to take B12 supplements to prevent deficiency \u2014 and there are even potential risks of over-doing it.\n\nOnly a handful of people\n\nSinha pointed to a recent study published in the online journal of JAMA which found an association between high intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 and hip fractures in older women.\n\nSinha said he only prescribes shots to patients for whom tablets can't be absorbed properly during digestion. \"I'd say maybe only a handful of people at most in the last 10 years have I ever actually thought would benefit from B12 injections.\"\n\nAs to why some physicians would be needlessly prescribing B12 shots, he said, \"It may be just habit. But clearly I think what the study showed was that this is a practice that's probably happening more often in Ontario than it should be happening.\"\n\nDr. William Silverstein, a recent graduate of medical school, remembered that little time was spent on the appropriate treatment of B12 deficiency, \"I recall there was one slide in my class that said you treat B12 deficiency with a pill or an injection. And that was it.\"", "description": "A review of patient records published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine has found 64 per cent of Ontario seniors who received vitamin B12 shots had no evidence of B12 deficiency.
