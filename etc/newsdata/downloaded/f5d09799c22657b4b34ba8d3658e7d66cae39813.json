One year of addiction treatment services and other programs is a Band-Aid.\n\nThe judgment is less than 4% of J&J's net profit from 2018, and significancly less than the $2 billion some Wall Street analysts expected J&J to end up paying \u2014 and that's why shares of J&J and other related companies soared in after-hours trading.\n\nIf this case is used as a benchmark in the national lawsuit, J&J likely would pay billions \u2014 but again, not an insurmountable amount for a company that brings in more than $80 billion of sales annually.\n\nWhat they're saying: J&J plans to appeal, saying in a statement the judge's decision was \"flawed\" and that it is ready to extend this fight into 2021.", "description": "This is a landmark decision.
