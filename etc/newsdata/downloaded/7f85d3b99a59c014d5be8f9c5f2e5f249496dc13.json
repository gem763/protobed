Then, minutes later, it was announced he had already signed with Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.\n\nOJ had a whole bunch to say about the huge sports story.\n\n\"Hey Twitter world,\" he started.\n\n\"What can I tell you... Antonio looks like you came out smelling like a rose, um I don't think many people are pulling for you right now but I'm not kicking you off my fantasy team I can tell you that but I hope you know...Belichick isn't going to put up with none of the stuff that Tomlinson, who maybe started all of this, and Grudin put up with..I'm just sayin' buddy, I don't think you can act like that in New England.\"\n\nAs expected Twitter went nuts, and people started commenting with things like, \"Kinda like you smelling like a rose after beating a double murder,\" and \"AB is killing it, amirite?\"", "description": "You Have To Hear This One...", "authors": ["Mike Walters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YgEdEy21AJigkrz58e4N0A--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/e8f4f77f12cac989cc63b2a1e5598aa7", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
