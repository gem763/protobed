Photo: Pari Dukovic\n\nThe most successful model of IMG Models\u2019 newest division brings in a comfortable six figures per year. He has been interviewed by Larry King, profiled by the New York Times, and flown to Australia to showcase swimwear. And when he arrives to work, spray-tanned and pedicured as the occasion demands, he is still sometimes mistaken for the electrician. \u201cSomeone goes, \u2018Oh, thank God you\u2019re here,\u2019\u201d Zach Miko says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was late. I follow them and they bring me over to a burnt-out outlet and they are like, \u2018This is the one you have to replace.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe usual male model is around six-foot-one, maybe six-foot-two, and falls somewhere along the spectrum of rawboned to gym-buffed. The sample clothes made for photo shoots are cut for their proportions: usually a 38 suit, a 32-inch waist. So the confusion is, perhaps, understandable. Miko, 30, stands six-foot-six and weighs 290 pounds, more tank than twink. He wears up to a size six-XL.\n\nMiko doesn\u2019t earn less than the lanky models. He earns more. \u201cIf I suddenly drop 50 pounds,\u201d Miko says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have any clients anymore.\u201d Welcome to the new frontier of plus-size male modeling.\n\nHunter Westfall.

The onrushing tide of body positivity, with its push for inclusivity and representation in advertising and media, had already raised the profiles of curvy female models \u2014 Graham appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue for the first time that year \u2014 and IMG Models president Ivan Bart made a bet that men could follow. (It was Bart who discovered Miko, on Instagram.) \u201cAt first, it caught me off guard,\u201d says Josh Stephens, whom Bart deputized to run the Brawn division. \u201cIs there a market for that? I didn\u2019t know anything about it \u2014 even though I\u2019m a big and tall guy.\u201d\n\nThe Brawn division was more or less a guess. Miko and IMG got rafts of good press but whether it would translate to actual work was an open question. But he began booking jobs, in a way he never did as an actor; he\u2019d said \u201ctens of lines on television,\u201d in his estimation, but was generally told by casting directors his size would make his prime years 50 and over and he made the better part of his living odd-jobbing. The average American man\u2019s waist size, according to the CDC, is 40 inches, just like Miko\u2019s (never mind that, at five-foot-nine, the average American man is almost a foot shorter than him). He began shooting for Target, Uniqlo, Nordstrom, Columbia, and Bonobos. Eventually he became, Stephens said, \u201cmore and more unavailable for bartending.\u201d\n\nThree years in, IMG now has seven models in the Brawn division, one of the largest among the international agencies who supply the major fashion houses. (Wilhelmina, a rival agency, also represents a number of bigger guys as part of its Titans division, which it launched in 2018, and recently partnered with Shaquille O\u2019Neal on a model search competition.) But at IMG, business is booming. According to the company, the Brawn division saw a 15 percent revenue growth in 2018 over 2017, and its models bookings were up 62 percent from the year prior.\n\nThere is no one Brawn body \u2014 there are sportier Brawn guys and bulkier Brawn guys \u2014 and they operate as a friendly, go-bro fraternity, pumping each other up and celebrating every yard gained. They have stories of meeting one another at castings or shoots, and connecting via DM, less competitive than one-for-all, and all-for-Brawn. \u201cMe being a sports guy,\u201d says Matt Wirken (29, six-foot six-and-a-half inches, 255 pouncs), who plays for the pro rugby team Rugby United New York and been shot for Tommy Hilfiger, Everlane, and Express, \u201cI was like, what if we took a team approach to an individualized industry? We\u2019re the Brawn boys. We\u2019re a crew. We\u2019re here to show you guys what\u2019s up.\u201d\n\nZach Miko (left) and Nemar Parchment.

Makeup artists and hairstylists stare; the Brawn guys have all been tended to, in Gulliverian style, by people standing on stepladders or apple boxes. Many of the clients they worked for had never worked with plus-size men before. \u201cThe first year and a half that I was working, I was the first time they\u2019d ever worked with a big guy, period,\u201d Miko says. \u201cI\u2019ve thought, man, if I mess this up, they\u2019re just not doing this ever again.\u201d\n\nBut the brands do come back. And size ranges are expanding, which not only benefits customers, but models too \u2014 much easier to shoot plus-size models when you don\u2019t have to slice shirts open in the back to get them on. Nordstrom, which booked Miko in 2017, has worked with him regularly since. (\u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about the plus-size customer for a long time,\u201d Ruth Basloe, Nordstrom\u2019s styling director, said in an email.) DXL Big + Tall \u2014 that\u2019s Destination XL, a big-and-tall retailer with more than 200 stores nationwide \u2014 hired first Miko, then Westfall and Wirken. \u201cThe whole big-and-tall arena as far as models go \u2014 it seems to have made a turn in the last three years,\u201d says Mark Albert, the vice-president of creative at the retailer. \u201cWe\u2019ve used IMG for several years on a regular-size basis because they didn\u2019t offer any Brawn sizing. It was refreshing when they started playing in that field.\u201d\n\nIf it has the feel of a foregone conclusion, it didn\u2019t seem that way to the guys. Not one said they\u2019d seriously considered modeling before. Miko spent a childhood and adolescence bouncing between Weight Watchers, fad diets, and diet pills. \u201cNever a thought for even a second that it was a thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be a model the same way I couldn\u2019t pitch for the Yankees.\u201d When he was approached about a modeling opportunity at a party, says Nemar Parchment (26, six-foot-one, size XXL; ASOS, Levi\u2019s), \u201cI just thought it was the alcohol talking. I didn\u2019t think he was going to follow through and book me.\u201d\n\nIs this the dawn of the Brawn Age? Not yet. There are still only seven Brawn men \u2014 and the newest one of them, Jon Toth, is tied up playing for the New York Jets until December \u2014 while the rosters still overflow with willowy Jenses and Olis and Frederiks. \u201cEven for how much we\u2019re working, there\u2019s still no luxury brands who have even thought about using us,\u201d Miko says. And yet here they are, splashing together at the Russian and Turkish Baths for our photographer, knowing their angles, switching up their poses, a supermodel dynasty in training. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a few clients that Zach\u2019s worked with,\u201d Wirken says. \u201cAnd people are like, \u2018This is where Zach Miko got his start. Maybe someday you\u2019ll be on that level.\u2019\u201d\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 30, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
