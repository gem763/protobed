The last time Northern Ireland took on Holland in 1976", "language": "en", "text": "The last time Northern Ireland played Holland in Rotterdam was 43 years ago this week. Travelling to De Kuip stadium, George Best sat next to a reporter on the team bus, in the days when such an arrangement was conceivable.\n\nOctober 13, 1976. Best's career was on the wane. He had turned 30 that summer and come back from his first stint in the US with Los Angeles Aztecs \u2014 his fifth club in two years since leaving Manchester United \u2014 to join Rodney Marsh and Bobby Moore at Fulham in the Second Division.\n\nNorthern Ireland's magnetic winger was making his first appearance for his country in three years. It was also manager Danny Blanchflower's first game in charge.\n\nGeorge Best attempts to take the ball around the Holland goalkeeper in the 1976 contest\n\nBest was tanned from his time in LA and the hair was a little longer, but he was more thick-set as age and excess began to catch up with him.\n\nBlanchflower could not have picked a more difficult opening game. Holland were in their pomp, riding high between World Cup final appearances in 1974 and 1978, with Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens and Rudi Krol at the peak of their powers. That team won every game in qualifying for Argentina '78 \u2014 except this one.\n\nWhat happened that night in Rotterdam is part of Northern Ireland football folklore, and not only because Best shared the pitch with Cruyff.\n\nBest promised a reporter before the game that he would nutmeg Johan Cruyff on the pitch\n\n'So just how good is the man widely accepted to be the best player in the world?' Bill Elliot \u2014 then of the Daily Express \u2014 asked Best on the bus.\n\n'Outstanding,' came the answer. 'Better than you?' Best laughed and promised the reporter that he would nutmeg Cruyff at the first opportunity.\n\nNo sooner had the Northern Ireland winger run on to the pitch clutching a red rose handed to him by a pretty blonde sitting near the tunnel than he made good on his promise. Dribbling from the left wing to the right, Best beat three Dutchmen before playing the ball through Cruyff's legs and raising a clenched fist to the auditorium in triumph.\n\nThe Manchester United legend struggled with a drinking problem for most of his adult life\n\n'That was Bestie,' says Sammy McIlroy, who was in the Northern Ireland team that night. 'He could do anything and everything. Cruyff just stood in astonishment and admired it. He put the ball through Neeskens' legs too and he was so annoyed that he ran around for the next 10 minutes trying to kick George!\n\n'It's amazing that he did it to players of that calibre. They didn't like that and it rattled the crowd as well.'\n\nMcIlroy set up the first goal for Chris McGrath as Northern Ireland took a shock lead. Krol and Cruyff struck in quick succession to put Holland ahead but substitute Derek Spence scored a late equaliser.\n\nJohan Cruyff dribbles past Argentina's goalkeeper before scoring at the 1974 World Cup\n\nThe Dutchman is widely regarded as one of the best footballers to have ever played the game\n\n'Unbelievable,' McIlroy told Sportsmail this week. 'We were meant to be lambs to the slaughter. I've never seen a face like Danny Blanchflower's that night. He had a grin the size of Holland. Flabbergasted. To get a 2-2 draw there was a miracle.'\n\nLater, back at the team hotel in Rotterdam, Best was enjoying a post-match meal and drinks with his team-mates when he was asked to take a phone call at reception.\n\n'He came back and told us it was some club in Europe that wanted him after his performance,' says Jimmy Nicholl. 'The boy comes back and says: 'Mr Best, there's another call for you', and away he goes again.\n\n'In the end they had to bring the phone to the table so he could take all these calls from football clubs all over Europe wanting him to go and play for them. That was supposedly him on the way out, so it just shows you what a great player he was. He was magnificent that night.'\n\nMichael O'Neill's men are ahead of Holland in Group C and are hoping to qualify for Euro 2020\n\nNicholl is now assistant manager of a Northern Ireland team that again faces a huge task to get a result in Rotterdam.\n\nDefeat would make it very difficult for Michael O'Neill's team to qualify from Group C ahead of Holland and Germany. O'Neill sees the next two games against the Dutch as effectively a play-off in which Northern Ireland need four points.\n\nHis three main strikers have a total of seven goals between them this season and face the most expensive centre-back pairing in history, Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nO'Neill admitted last night he would have to be 'a magician' to correct that imbalance. 'I would love to tell you we have another George Best in the making,' he said. 'But that's not true.'", "description": "October 13, 1976. Best's career was on the wane.
