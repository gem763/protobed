Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nBTO-ers, rejoice \u2013 you can now stock your home full of Taobao furniture without taking a risk on size or quality.\n\nThe Chinese ecommerce giant launched its first physical store in Singapore\u2019s Funan Mall on Wednesday (Sept 4), which acts as a showroom where customers can see items before buying them online.\n\nThe platform is known for offering tons of trendy furniture at budget prices, but customers previously had to rely on pictures to decide if they wanted to buy something.\n\nNow, the store gives them the chance to see and test the pieces first.\n\nBusiness Insider visited the store before its launch. Here\u2019s what it was like inside:\n\nBargain hunters, take note: Singapore is now home to Southeast Asia\u2019s first physical Taobao store.\n\ncaption You can see, touch and test out furniture sold on the site. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nTucked in a corner of Funan Mall\u2019s Basement 2, the store has over 300 items, mostly chosen for their popularity online.\n\ncaption Like this fetching set of ceramic cutlery and matching table. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nTaobao decided to open the store after the overwhelming popularity of its NomadX showcase at Plaza Singapura last year.\n\ncaption Customers want to touch and see furniture before buying, as it tends to be more expensive, said Taobao\u2019s Singapore business development lead, Charlene Zhang. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nWhen we visited, the store had two \u201crooms\u201d on display: a bedroom and a living room.\n\ncaption Furniture on display will be changed every three months. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe furniture in these rooms was mainly from Linsy, a top-selling merchant among Singapore users.\n\ncaption Decorative products from other brands were also featured. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nIn other parts of the store, there were multiple chairs, sofas, shelves and tables on display.\n\ncaption Everything in the store can be bought \u2013 even the overhead lights. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThere were heaps of decorative items, like decals, vases, cushions \u2013 and strangely, a whole shelf of puzzles.\n\ncaption A rep said the puzzles were a top-selling item. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThere were two beds on display, and one wardrobe.\n\ncaption More items will be added in the future. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe kitchen zone featured cutlery and appliances like pots and juicers, as well as one island.\n\ncaption The pipe shelves are also for sale. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nOne section featured popular household items, like cleaning gloves with a built-in scrubber.\n\ncaption They sold out quickly. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nTo buy an item, customers have to scan a QR code and order it off the Taobao site. It will be delivered one or two weeks later.\n\ncaption However, small decorative items (like bowls) can be purchased on the spot. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nNone of the larger items had price tags. This is because prices change daily depending on the merchant, a Taobao rep explained.\n\ncaption Prices of items in the store that day ranged from S$650 for a bed to S$275 for a cabinet. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe most impressive part of the store was a screen with software that lets customers design the interior of their house.\n\ncaption Staff will help. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe software can create a 3D layout of a customer\u2019s home with a floor plan supplied by the customer.\n\ncaption This was a unit in Malaysia\u2019s R&F Princess Cove. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe customer can then test out layouts and see what furniture can fit the flat.\n\ncaption No more measuring tape and exasperated returns! source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nWe tried changing the furniture in 3D to try out different looks.\n\ncaption I could see this feature being incredibly popular with newlyweds or anyone looking to furnish a home from scratch. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nFor me, the best part of the store was definitely the software.\n\ncaption It\u2019s not sexy, but it works. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAs far as I know, a typical Taobao furniture shopper wants to decorate their space stylishly on the cheap.\n\nBecause the software gives users a good idea of how their home will look after separate furniture pieces go in, this makes it a godsend for those trying to DIY their interior design. If used properly, Taobao\u2019s new service will save homeowners from scenarios like mismatched furniture, too-large or too many items, and the trouble of lugging pieces around to test different layouts.\n\nA word of warning, however: Taobao expects the software service to be very popular once the store is open, so booking a slot early to use it is highly recommended.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Don't dare to order a sofa on Taobao?
