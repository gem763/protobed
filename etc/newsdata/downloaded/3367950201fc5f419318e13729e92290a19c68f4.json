The California-based organization was founded in 1993 and has worked to advance gun control and gun safety regulation. \u201cWe did email Councilmember Koretz\u2019s staff, and we will support it by getting our constituents to speak for it and will do whatever we can to make sure that this ordinance passes,\u201d Bennett said. Although WAGV supports banning the possession of assault weapons, Bennett said the city should prepare a buyback program in order to avoid property concerns. \u201cI can see how that might be problematic and they might be sued for that because they would have to do an enforced buyback so there would not be a taking of property,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cBut hey, we would absolutely support something like that.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not an attorney, but I don\u2019t think the city government taking guns in exchange for some cash would really help the city\u2019s case if it does put a ban on the books. This isn\u2019t a matter of eminent domain, where the government can acquire private property for a public use as long as it pays fair market value. No, this is taking private property because the government simply doesn\u2019t want you to have it. Even in the bad old days of Prohibition, the alcohol you legally possessed when the ban on booze took effect was yours to keep. Not so with the new prohibitionists. You\u2019re simply told to turn in your gun and accept some cash or else become a criminal.\n\nUCLA law professor Adam Winkler believes the measure will likely pass the LA City Council, and says while he doesn\u2019t expect a local ordinance to have much of an effect, it could lead to similar measures being introduced at the state level or around the country.\n\nWinkler said this law could affect gun regulations in other states and cities, as Los Angeles has historically been at the forefront of gun control and gun safety regulation. \u201cWhen Los Angeles banned the possession of high-capacity magazines, it was followed by the state ban thereafter,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cSo LA is often a leader in gun safety reforms.\u201d\n\nWhat Winkler doesn\u2019t say is that the ban on possession of \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines is currently blocked by a federal judge because of concerns that it violates the 2nd Amendment rights of Californians. If banning commonly owned magazines is a violation of the right to keep and bear arms, then a ban on commonly owned firearms is likely to be just as problematic. Not that the constitutionality of a gun control proposal matters to the activists and politicians supporting it. They\u2019ll pass the ban and worry about the legal consequences later. Gun owners in California and across the nation should get ready to see similar bans introduced elsewhere, however. It\u2019s increasingly apparent that the gun control movement believes that the public will support a ban and \u201cbuyback\u201d, and are becoming increasingly willing to push the unconstitutional plan wherever they think it might see success.", "description": "LA council member Paul Koretz says within a year the city could ban all semi-automatic firearms deemed \"assault weapons\".", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/80/2272f605-608b-4f82-be15-e6937bdf7548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
