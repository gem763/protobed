They were considered 'prospects' of the Hells Angels Motorcyle Club's Slough chapter, and its affiliate group the Red Devils Motorcycle Club.\n\nAll but one of the defendants - Kidd - were convicted of 10 offences, namely violent disorder, six counts of GBH with intent, ABH, possession of a bladed article, and possession of an offensive weapon.\n\nHells Angels prospects stormed this venue and caused carnage as they unleashed an attack with weapons\n\nPrzemyslaw Korkus (left) and Jimi Kidd (right) were part of a group that stormed a venue in sleepy Surrey as bikers armed with knives, bats and an industrial cable left the site a bloody mess\n\nKidd was acquitted of possession of a bladed article and possession of an offensive weapon. All seven were jailed for 14 years.\n\nPassing sentence, Judge John described the nighttime attack as an 'appalling piece of gratuitous planned violence', noting that each defendant had continued to protest their innocence despite conviction.\n\nAt the hearing, aggravating factors cited included the number of victims, the fact the attack took place in a 'semi-public place', the ongoing effect on the victims - one of whom now has PTSD - and the concealing of evidence were put forward by prosecutor Richard Hearnden.\n\nMitigation was heard from barristers representing each of the seven men, most of which included references to their character, personal lives and their roles in the incident.\n\nThe sentences were ordered to run concurrently to each other. Reductions were given on account of mitigation and previous good character, if applicable.\n\nEach defendant sat silently while the jail terms were read out, with many being supported in court by those in the public gallery.\n\nPictured: Ladislav Szalay and David Jacobs, who unleashed chaos at the venue in order to establish a Hells Angels stronghold\n\nMr Hearnden had previously told the court that the attack came from a need to 'deal with' the Vikings so that the Hells Angels could set up a new chapter in Surrey.\n\nThis was said to have initially been done through an attempt to entice to Wargs to switch their affiliation from the Vikings to the Hells Angels.\n\nOn November 1, a week before the attack, Kidd, 38, and another Hells Angels member met with two Wargs members at Cobham Services.\n\nPictured: Piotr Zmijewski and Bartosz Plesniak, each of whom were jailed for 14 years at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court\n\nKidd had been a member of the Vikings for six years before signing up with the Hells Angels.\n\nHowever, Mr Hearnden said, it soon became clear that the Vikings would resist any attempt to persuade the Wargs to leave, so the Hells Angels and the Red Devils 'hatched a last minute plan' to attack the Wargs meeting on November 7.\n\nMr Hearnden added that prospective members 'must demonstrate devotion and loyalty to their clubs', and said: 'What better way for a prospect to show unswerving loyalty to their club than a mission to intimidate a rival club with extreme violence?'\n\nOn the evening of November 7, Korkus, 40, Plesniak, 34, Zamijewski, 44, Szalay, 32, Tomacsek, 38, and Jacobs, 28, met with other unidentified Hells Angels and Red Devils at the Hells Angels club house in Slough before driving to South Godstone station.\n\nKorkus, Plesniak, and Tomacsek, were driving their own cars, tracked by ANPR cameras, while the other defendants' presence at the scene was given away by their mobile phones.\n\nMeanwhile, Kidd drove his Nissan Qashqai to Sainsbury's in Haywards Heath, before heading to Blindley Heath.\n\nCCTV showed Kidd passing the Forman Institute at least twice and parking at South Godstone station, signalling to the other vehicles there.\n\nA little after 7pm, the four-car convoy left the station and parked in St John's Meadow, just north of the Institute. CCTV captured a gang of 13 men walking down towards the social club.\n\nThe youngest victim, 21-year-old Reece Hobbs, was attacked in the car park, where he'd been to fetch a jacket for a fellow member.\n\nHe was stabbed as he attempted to make it back to The Shud, falling through the door before collapsing in the corner of the room, his intestines falling out of a stomach stab wound.\n\nThe other occupants of the outbuilding were stabbed, aside from one. Those responsible then fled and drove back to Slough, apart from Kidd who headed north to where his parents lived.\n\nNo weapons were recovered aside from a length of electric cable found in St John's Meadow with Zamijewski's DNA on one end, and one of the victims' blood on the other.\n\nA black nitrile glove discovered near where the bikers had parked was found to have Korkus's DNA on it. Korkus, a 25-stone thug, was the first to be arrested, still wearing his blood-stained clothes from the attack.\n\nA week later Kidd, Plesniak, Zamijewski, and Tomacsek were arrested and charged with Szalay in January. Jacobs was arrested and charged in March.\n\nTheir trial began on June 11 and lasted seven weeks. Following the sentencing, Surrey Police said: 'We're proud of the work that bought these men to justice - and two of our officers received judges commendations for their role.\n\n'There were more than 1,500 exhibits, and 1,000s of documents which had to be catalogued and disclosed in court.'", "description": "Seven prospects have been jailed after 13 men stormed the Forman Institute in Blindley Heath armed with knives, baseball bats and other weapons including an industrial cable.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/07/20167856-0-image-a-31_1571984557628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
