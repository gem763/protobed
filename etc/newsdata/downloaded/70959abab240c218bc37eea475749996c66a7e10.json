Yet, our point was to gird yourselves for as little meaningful price action through the week as possible.\n\nIndeed, crude\u2019s and benchmarks barely changed more than a dime either way the first three days, before breaking out on Thursday on reports of an imminent deal from the trade talks, as well as OPEC\u2019s hint that it might cut more supply when it meets in December.\n\n, which saw just a 50 cent change on Monday, finally tanked on Thursday as the Fed remained evasive on its next easing.\n\nUntil more is known on all this, we are continuing with this week\u2019s select coverage of commodities with new buy-in opportunities. With the recent focus on sugar, corn and orange juice, we turn today to cotton.\n\nCotton is one of the most widely grown non-food crops and a stable source of income to the textiles industry. Once a revered raw material, even earning the phrase \u201cCotton is King\u201d in the 1800s, prices of the fibrous product these days often fare no better than those of , another ubiquitous but struggling industrial commodity.\n\nYet, cotton may be getting a break hereon if U.S. production of the fiber keeps declining.\n\nThe other thing that could work in its favor is a trade deal of some sort between the United States and China\u2014the latter being the world's biggest cotton consumer.\n\nProduction Slide, U.S.-China Trade Deal Seen To Boost Prices\n\nThe World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates for cotton, a monthly report released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday, showed production down by around 1% to 21.7 million bales this month\u2014largely the result of a reduction in Texas.\n\nThat in itself wouldn\u2019t be a major price driver. But combine it with Thursday\u2019s report by the New York Times that there may be a partial U.S.-China deal announced before the end of this week, and you may actually see cotton getting a lifeline.\n\nSaid Eric Scoles, a commodities strategist at RJO Futures who\u2019s been watching cotton trends:\n\n\u201cProduction estimates have been in decline due to weather this season and some suggest it could be worse than anticipated. With increasing concerns on production, cotton prices have been leaning bullish in momentum through this consolidation channel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been some recent optimism going into this next round of US/China trade talks with hopes of a partial deal, which could offer additional fuel for rising prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf upcoming news and reports are bullish, we could see cotton not just break out, but start a more sustained bull run.\u201d\n\nBullish Calls On The Rise\n\non ICE Futures U.S. have seen a hive of activity, hitting six-week highs of 63.30 cents a lb on Sept 13.\n\nCotton 300-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s settlement, ICE\u2019s benchmark December cotton stood at 61.56 cents. While the price action has been virtually flat on the week, month-to-date it was up 1.7% after a gain of 3.2% in September\u2014its first positive month after five straight months of losses.\n\nInvesting.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation on December cotton, projecting near-term resistance at 63.33.\n\nMike Seery, a commodities strategist in Plainfield, Illinois, said he has been recommending a bullish position in cotton from around the 61.50 level:\n\n\u201cThis trade has been very stubborn. I still believe higher prices are ahead and you can be profitable if you place stop loss at the Aug 26th low of 56.59.\u201d\n\nSeery said he had various bullish calls for cotton based on USDA crop progress reports showing 77% of the bolls\u2014or the rounded seed capsule of cotton plants\u2014having opened in Texas and harvest at 25% complete.\n\nICE\u2019s December cotton contract is currently trading above the 100-day Daily Moving Average and below the 200-day DMA. Major resistance remains at 62.81.\n\nSaid Seery:", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Barani Krishnan/Investing.com covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Copper Futures, Brent Oil Futures.
