But because of a quirk in the party\u2019s rules, there are already more candidates qualified for the October debate than there were for September\u2019s.\n\nThe next debate is set for Tuesday, Oct. 15, with a possible second night added, depending on how many candidates qualify. The DNC hasn\u2019t said how many qualifiers mean the field will be divided into two nights of debate, though they have previously capped it at 10 on stage at a time. Eleven candidates have already qualified, with billionaire activist Tom Steyer set for his debut on the stage.\n\nWho has qualified for each debate\n\nFirst debate Fourth Second Third Biden Booker Buttigieg Castro Harris Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke Sanders Warren Yang Steyer Bennet de Blasio Delaney Gabbard Dropped out Gillibrand Dropped out Hickenlooper Inslee Dropped out Ryan Williamson Swalwell Dropped out Bullock Messam Dropped out Moulton Sestak Requirements to qualify First and second debates Third and fourth debates 1% in 3 polls or 65,000 donors 2% in 4 polls and 130,000 donors First debate Fourth Second Third Biden Booker Buttigieg Castro Harris Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke Sanders Warren Yang Steyer Bennet de Blasio Delaney Gabbard Dropped out Gillibrand Hickenlooper Dropped out Inslee Dropped out Ryan Williamson Swalwell Dropped out Bullock Messam Dropped out Moulton Sestak Requirements to qualify First and second debates Third and fourth debates 1% in 3 polls or 65,000 donors 2% in 4 polls and 130,000 donors First debate Fourth Second Third Biden Booker Buttigieg Castro Harris Klobuchar O\u2019Rourke Sanders Warren Yang Steyer Bennet de Blasio Delaney Gabbard Gillibrand Dropped out Hickenlooper Dropped out Inslee Dropped out Ryan Williamson Swalwell Dropped out Bullock Messam Moulton Dropped out Sestak Requirements to qualify First and second debates Third and fourth debates 1% in 3 polls or 65,000 donors 2% in 4 polls and 130,000 donors\n\nAccording to the DNC\u2019s rules, candidates must register at least 2 percent in four DNC-approved polls and earn donations from at least 130,000 individuals by Oct. 1 to qualify for the fourth debate. That gave candidates an additional five weeks to reach the same goals as the previous debate.\n\nThe tougher qualification rules did have some impact. Five candidates dropped out of the race in July and August: Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). But 20 Democrats remain.\n\n[We\u2019re asking 2020 Democrats where they stand on key issues]\n\nTwo other candidates have registered at least 2 percent in any qualifying poll: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and author Marianne Williamson. Both say they have met the individual donor threshold.\n\nCandidates on the bubble\n\nPollsters don\u2019t typically announce their release schedules in advance, so it is not clear how many more chances Williamson or Gabbard will have to qualify before the Oct. 1 deadline. But a qualifying poll has been released roughly every three days in recent months.\n\nA less publicized DNC rule requires each of a candidate\u2019s four polls to come from different pollsters, or from different geographic areas. Gabbard earned 2 percent in a recent CNN-SSRS national poll, but it didn\u2019t count toward her total because she had already earned 2 percent in the August version of the same poll.\n\nHow each candidate has polled\n\nPolled at least 2% Polled less than 2% At least 2%, but poll is duplicate Deadline for September debate (Aug. 28) Biden IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA IA NV NH SC June 28 Sept. 17 Buttigieg Harris Sanders Warren Booker O\u2019Rourke Yang Klobuchar Castro Steyer Not included in polls Not yet qualified Gabbard Williamson At least 2%, but poll is duplicate Polled at least 2% Polled less than 2% Deadline for September debate (Aug. 28) June 28 Sept. 17 IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA IA NV NH SC Biden Buttigieg Harris Sanders Warren Booker O\u2019Rourke Yang Klobuchar Castro Not included in polls Steyer Not yet qualified Gabbard Williamson Polled at least 2% At least 2%, but poll is duplicate Polled less than 2% Deadline for September debate (Aug. 28) June 28 Sept. 17 IA SC NH NH SC IA SC IA IA NV NH SC Biden Buttigieg Harris Sanders Warren Booker O\u2019Rourke Yang Klobuchar Castro Not included in polls Steyer Not yet qualified Gabbard Williamson\n\nAshlyn Still contributed to this report.\n\nAbout this report\n\nThis analysis is based on rules set by the DNC.
