Delaware led all states with a 20 percent decrease in its average premium, in part because the state implemented a \u201creinsurance\u201d program helping insurers afford high-cost patients.\n\nAbout two-thirds of enrollees receiving subsidies, who make up about 87 percent of the market, will pay less than $75 per month in premiums if they keep the same level of coverage, and about one-third will pay under $10 per month.\n\nOf those earning too much to receive federal help, more than a third will pay over $500 per month in premiums. About another third will pay between $300 and $500.\n\n\u201cThese premiums are still unaffordable by many,\u201d Azar said, contending that the law remains fundamentally flawed and must be replaced. \u201cThis is not a workable way for Americans to finance the care they need \u2026 but we are headed in the right direction.\u201d\n\nHigh out-of-pocket costs continue to be a challenge. The median deductible for mid-level \"silver\" plans in the insurance marketplaces is more than $4,600, up 3 percent from this year.\n\nIt's possible a federal appeals court could issue a decision on the validity of the Affordable Care Act by the time enrollment opens Nov. 1. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing a decision from a federal judge who found the entire law was unconstitutional.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will continue to enforce the health care law while the legal challenge winds through the courts. The final word is likely to come from the Supreme Court next year.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f4/d4/3f34fd534fbf828b59b2bf94ba94/191022-obamacare-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
