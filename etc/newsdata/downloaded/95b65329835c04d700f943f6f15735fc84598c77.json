Welcome to Fatima Shop, a fashion boutique for Muslim women.\n\nFatima Asmaa Paciotti, a 55-year-old Italian entrepreneur who converted to Islam in 2005, first began selling faith-influenced clothes on Facebook. The page now boasts over 33,000 followers and Paciotti has added a brick-and-mortar store to the mix.\n\nThe store\u2019s rising profile is even more impressive because it is in Cant\u00f9, in the northern province of Como, where a far-right League party politician was elected mayor in the most recent elections. Another local League member, Nicola Molteni, has launched a battle against women who wear Muslim veils in public.\n\nFatima Shop\u2019s one-of-kind merchandise has been designed to draw people in, regardless of their background. Nothing is left to chance: \u201cThis is a boutique, not a bazaar,\u201d Paciotti told HuffPost Italy as she leaned behind the counter, revealing a strong Roman accent and a smile framed by her veil. She has created a unique ambience in the shop, which is decorated in a shabby chic style, featuring furniture and mirrors from all over the world.\n\n\u201cComing into my store is a sensory experience,\u201d she said. It\u2019s not only clothes that embellish the boutique. There are perfumes (strictly alcohol-free) from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia in scents ranging from pink vanilla to black musk, which is \u201cjust like the one Prophet Muhammad used.\u201d\n\nFaith guides the designs of both the apparel and the store itself: Two editions of the Quran are prominently displayed on an empty piece of teak furniture upon which Paciotti intends to showcase a range of niqabs, the full veil that leaves only the eyes uncovered.\n\n\u201cIf sisters decide to wear it, they should have the freedom to do so. I want everyone to find what they are looking for in my shop,\u201d said Paciotti, who for three years wore her own niqab, despite insults and threats lobbed her way. She said she was once almost run over by a man who yelled at her to \u201cgo back to her country.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim veil is controversial in Italy, as it has been in many parts of Europe.\n\nBut Paciotti, who has lived in Cant\u00f9 since 1993, said she earned the trust of her neighboring shopkeepers in just a few days.\n\n\u201cThey were worried that I would cause a commotion and that I would invade the area with people who eat couscous on the street,\u201d she said. But the locals changed their minds once they saw the store, and a League councilor even welcomed her to the area; although there are the occasional passersby who turn up their noses and walk away.\n\nNon-Muslim customers also visit the store and \u201cfall in love with the colors and designs, which are so different from what they are used to,\u201d Paciotti said. Wide Jilbab pants \u2014 reminiscent of those featured in \u201cAladdin\u201d \u2014 are popular, as are knee-length colored sweatshirts and dresses made of lace. Some customers prefer their clothes in the traditional black, but Paciotti said younger Muslim women are asking for khimars, or cloaks that cover the body from the head down, in various colors. A long blue tunic, which was made by Syrian refugees, hangs in the shop window and often catches the eyes of people walking past.\n\nPaciotti said her religious journey inspired her to open the shop, and that she thought it was important to find a way to blend beauty with faith.\n\n\u201cA few years ago when I decided to dress like a Muslim woman, I only found poor quality clothes that were also expensive. They didn\u2019t last long, and sometimes they were uncomfortable,\u201d Paciotti said, while positioning copper lamps around the store. She identified a need for beautiful, high-quality clothing.\n\nAfter all, she said, \u201cas the Prophet Muhammed says, God is beautiful and he loves beauty.\u201d", "description": "When Fatima Asmaa Paciotti first began selling Muslim clothing in this northern Italy town, many right-wing locals were skeptical.", "authors": ["Elisabetta Invernizzi", "Huffpost Italy"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d964f752100001403fa07fb.webp?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
