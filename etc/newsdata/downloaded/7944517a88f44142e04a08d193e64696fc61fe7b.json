Jernigan even had meals with Howard in his home with his wife and children, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cWe shared stories [and] we talked about personal lives,\u201d Howard told WITN.\n\nHoward and his now-ex-wife, Julie George Howard (now Julie Kendall George), were married for 12 years, and they have two children together. There was some \u201cgenuine love and affection\u201d between the married couple, court records state.\n\nAD\n\nGeorge did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHoward and George had been happily married until George met Jernigan, then a first-year teacher, in 2016. The local school district had assigned her to be his mentor around August or September that year, according to court documents.\n\nAD\n\nThe relationship between the two was at first professional before turning more personal.\n\nRomantic gears shifted between Jernigan and George around January 2017, and they consummated their relationship around late March or early April that year. George would text and call her lover over a Tracfone he had given her so that Howard wouldn\u2019t find out, according to court documents.\n\nThe lawsuit Howard filed said George and Jernigan would rendezvous at Jernigan\u2019s apartment and that they had even met in downtown restaurants where friends and associates could see on more than one occasion.\n\nAD\n\nGeorge and Howard had started marriage counseling in March 2017 as well, something Jernigan knew about, according to records.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Howard confronted his wife about the affair in April 2017, she confessed, saying that Jernigan had said all the right things to her and that sex with him was a mistake, according to court documents. They stayed together until June 23, 2017, and were divorced on Sept. 25, 2018.\n\nHoward filed his lawsuit on Aug. 1, 2017, and Jernigan was served two days later, according to court records.\n\nCan having sex with married Mississippian, outside Mississippi, expose you to an \u201calienation of affections\u201d lawsuit in Mississippi?\n\nProblems with the law\n\nExactly how Howard will be able to collect the judgment and the amount of time cases like his take have some attorneys questioning the laws\u2019 necessity.\n\nKellie Chappell-Gonzalez, a founding attorney at Capital to Coast NC Law Group, noted that cases like Howard\u2019s cost time and money, which could have long-term consequences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnce you file this case and talk about your child\u2019s mother or father or whoever it was that cheated on you, it becomes public record and your kids can see that,\u201d she said, noting that she often stresses the significance of these filings to her clients. \u201cOne of these days, your kids are going to get a copy of this.\u201d\n\nRussell, who said she often refers clients to others after she extensively outlines the pros and cons, called the laws a \u201cform of legalized extortion\u201d that is scarring children.\n\n\u201cMost practicing attorneys think that this is corrupt,\u201d she said, adding that she thinks most matters around divorce can be settled. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we\u2019re proud of in the state of North Carolina.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe majority of cases like Howard\u2019s are settled, but it depends on a variety of factors as to whether a lawyer will take up a case, said Anastasia Cowan, senior associate attorney at Arnold & Smith Law Firm.\n\nAD\n\nThe discovery phase, filing depositions and hiring private investigators can add up for clients and emotionally drain them.\n\nMills, who declined to reveal her fee in the Howard case, said the average settlement in these cases is about $50,000 to $90,000. Howard\u2019s case, however, wasn\u2019t the highest judgment she has seen. She once saw a judgment of $5.9 million in 2010 for a similar case, she said.\n\nHer contemporaries estimate that Howard probably spent between $10,000 and $75,000 in attorney fees alone over the two years and that it is unlikely he will pocket the judgment amount.\n\nAD\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the purpose of Howard\u2019s lawsuit, Mills said.\n\n\u201cMy client will probably not see any of this money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a moral victory for him.\u201d\n\nJernigan represented himself in the case, and he probably should have taken the matter more seriously, Chappell-Gonzalez said.\n\nAD\n\nHe faces liens on any property he has, and his credit could be negatively affected. He could, however, appeal the decision, and if the appeal court overturns the judgment, it could set a precedent, Russell said.\n\nMills and Howard haven\u2019t tried to execute the judgment for now, but the judgment is valid for 10 years, Mills said. If Jernigan were to come into money or property within that time, the door to collect will be open.\n\nHoward is trying to move on, Mills said.\n\n\u201cI would say that he\u2019s accepted the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is, through therapy, in a good place now.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n$8.8 million \u2018alienation of affection\u2019 penalty: Another reason not to have an affair in North Carolina\n\nHis wife was having an affair, so he stalked her and tried to frame a DHS employee\n\nWas tabloid expos\u00e9 of Bezos affair just juicy gossip or a political hit job?", "description": "North Carolina is one of a handful of states with \"homewrecker laws,\" which allow a scorned spouse to sue for damages.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uPKC8mRfWXQRJSHcG2etUxErbm0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NERGCEXGEAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
