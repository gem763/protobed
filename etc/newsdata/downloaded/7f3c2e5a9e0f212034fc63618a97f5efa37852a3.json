Really anxious.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean in a \u2013 normal level of worry about work deadlines, or giving a presentation \u2013 kind of anxious, I mean full-blown, clinical anxiety with all the fun physical and psychological effects that come with it.\n\nWe\u2019re all looking for ways to feel better, and the first thing to do if you\u2019re worried about anxiety is speak to your GP, who will be able to prescribe a range of treatments from CBT to talking therapy to medication.\n\nBut there are things you can do alongside traditional medical treatments to alleviate your symptoms. Including trying out acupressure.\n\nAcupressure is an ancient Chinese therapy \u2013 and an acupressure mat is basically like a much less intense bed of nails that applies pressure to points on your back as you lie on it.\n\nAcupressure is said to help with pain, injuries, relaxation and sleep (Picture: Getty)\n\nIt\u2019s said to offer physical rehab for pain relief, muscle repair and injury recovery, but it\u2019s also meant to be good for mental relaxation, deep sleep and meditation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is where the anxiety part comes in.\n\nA major study in 2015 found that depression, anxiety and stress can be positively impacted by acupressure.\n\nSubjects were given treatment three times a week for four weeks and the results were positive. It was found to significantly reduce depression, stress and anxiety.\n\nWhat is acupressure? As the name suggests, acupressure works by applying pressure to various points of the body whereas acupuncture uses needles. Acupressure restores balance to the body\u2019s energy flow (qi) by manipulating the body\u2019s meridians. The term \u2018Meridian\u2019 refers to the set of pathways that flow through body, acting as a mode of transport for vital energy. This energy effects everything from mood to health and wellbeing. Applying enough pressure on specific points of the meridian lines can stimulate the brain and even work to provide drug-free pain relief. Sarah Brown, acupressure practitioner and health specialist at LastVerdict\n\nIn a 2016 study on rats, acupuncture was again found to be effective for reducing anxiety. The researchers suggested that it impacts how the body triggers the fight-or-flight response.\n\nResearchers do concede that we don\u2019t know enough about how acupressure could impact different kinds of anxiety \u2013 including panic attacks and phobias \u2013 but the results are positive nonetheless.\n\nAcupressure mat works in a similar way to acupuncture \u2013 stimulating energy, vitality and a sense of well being in the body.\n\nThe gentle pressure of the mat allows the body to relax and release endorphins \u2013 the body\u2019s natural painkiller. When using the mat you\u2019re meant to feel a sense of elation, happiness, energy and calm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich sounds great to be honest.\n\n\u2018The benefits of acupressure holds no bounds,\u2019 explains Sarah Brown, acupressure practitioner and health specialist at LastVerdict.\n\n\u2018There are literally hundreds of acupressure points around the body that address a countless number of body conditions. Even if you do not fully commit to believing in the benefits of acupressure, everyone is often in agreement that it serves as a great source of relaxation.\u2019\n\nSarah says she has seen a rise in people using acupressure for migraines and period pain, and it can also help to boost the immune system and aid in digestion.\n\n\u2018Acupressure can combat anxiety as it ignites the nervous system in order to produce chemicals that work to provide pain relief, whilst stimulating the part of the brain that regulates emotions,\u2019 explains Sarah.\n\n\u2018The quickest \u201cacupressure point for on the go\u201d when anxiety hits, is to sit in an upright position and place your thumb in between your eyebrows quite firmly. Circle the thumb whilst breathing in through the nose and out through your mouth.\n\n\u2018As you inhale, your stomach should rise and fall. Ensure that you are not breathing into the chest. As a few minutes pass, see if you can make your exhales longer than your inhales.\n\n\u2018Practicing this action will relax the nervous system and reduce a speeding heart rate.\n\n\u2018I recommend using an acupressure mat in-between professional sessions, and it is wise to remember that they do not focus on one part of the body, but stimulate several points at one time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get the maximum benefit, Yogi Bare suggests that you lie on one of their mats (which come with an optional pillow) for 20-40 minutes, several times a week.\n\nIt can become part of a mediation or yoga practice.\n\nTips for using an acupressure mat The mat will feel uncomfortable to lie on, so take the time to find the right position for you. You may also wish to experiment with lying on a towel until you find the right level of sensation. The spikes have a rounded tip, so can\u2019t hurt you, however people with sensitive skin, haemophilia or psoriasis should use the mat with caution. The Acupressure Mat will allow your body to start breaking down toxins so please remember to drink water after use. Yogi Bare\n\nAcupressure is a great option for people who want the benefits of acupuncture, but aren\u2019t keen on the needles.\n\nAcupressure is non-invasive and considered to be really safe. The only risk is the possibility of temporary heaviness, aching, or tingling at the point of the acupressure administration \u2013 but we can handle that.\n\nYogi Bare\u2019s mat costs \u00a319.99 and the pillow is \u00a312.99 \u2013 so you can turn your living room into a calming wellness centre for a really affordable price.\n\nMORE: Gay and bisexual South Asian men launch HIV test campaign to help diversify LGBTQ+ spaces\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Woman completes 10k obstacle race with hi-tech \u2018pirate leg\u2019 after breaking her ankle\n\nMORE: Bodhi the adventure cat joins his owner for cross-country skiing and paddleboarding\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Acupressure mats work a bit like acupuncture - just without the needles.
