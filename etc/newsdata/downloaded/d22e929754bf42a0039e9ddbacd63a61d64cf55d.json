Then, in 2016, that number began to shrink, albeit ever so slightly.\n\nSo, are we finally coming to our senses about McMansions?\n\nOf course, owning a big house has long been a key component of the American Dream \u2014 you know you\u2019ve arrived when you have columns, an indoor pool and a theater room \u2014 but, in reality, it\u2019s all usually a huge waste of space, according to a study cited by Steve Adcock on the Get Rich Slowly blog.\n\nA research team affiliated with UCLA studied American families and where they spend most of their time while inside their homes. The results were fascinating, but really not all that surprising. Here\u2019s one representative example:\n\nAs you can see, most square footage is wasted as people tend to gather around the kitchen and the television, while avoiding the dining room and porch.\n\n\u201cThe findings were not pretty. In fact, they helped prove how little we use our big homes for things other than clutter,\u201d Adcock said. \u201cMost families don\u2019t use large areas of their homes \u2014 which means they\u2019ve essentially wasted money on space they don\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nAnd Adcock knows a thing or two about utilizing space.\n\nLike the family in the illustration above, he used to spend all of his time hanging out in the kitchen and family room in his 1,600-square-foot home. Now, after managing to retire from his full-time gig at the age of 35, he lives his version of the American Dream in an Airstream trailer with his wife.\n\nCheck out a tour of his \u201chome\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe full-time RV life isn\u2019t for everyone, and it\u2019s not my intent to convince you otherwise,\u201d Adcock explained. \u201cInstead, use my story as a testament to the fact that large homes are very much a choice. Few of us need the space we buy.\u201d\n\nHis takeaway: Forget the standard realtor advice that you should \u201cbuy as big of a house as you can afford.\u201d\n\nInstead, buy as much house as you need. \u201cMore does not automatically equal better,\u201d he said. \u201cMore simply means more.\u201d", "description": "Why the American Dream of owning a McMansion may be overrated.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FR928_mansio_MG_20170808182924.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-21"}
