Amazingly, when James Corden\u2019s Francis Henshall said how hungry he was, someone in the audience proffered a sandwich. Not only that, it was hummus, the perfect comedy filling. Corden kept his composure long enough to make a quip about Guardian readers and everyone fell about. It seemed too good to be true.\n\nSpoiler alert: it was too good to be true. None of it was improvised. The remarkable quality of Hytner\u2019s production was its illusion of being made up on the fly. I watched one performance with surtitles and saw line-by-line that it left nothing to chance.\n\nTo create this sense of chaos took brilliant, meticulous work and, although this revival by Sarah Brigham hoodwinks the audience into its theatrical games (they laugh a lot), it lacks the original\u2019s taste for danger. That\u2019s reflected in her \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d staging, which follows the NT production to the letter. Brigham sticks to the 1963 setting, the checked jodhpurs of David O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Henshall and the skiffle band ushering us in. Neil Irish\u2019s set has the same weekly-rep staginess, and the routines still recall the heyday of British variety.\n\nRichard Bean\u2019s reworking of Carlo Goldoni\u2019s The Servant of Two Masters is breezily performed by the 19-strong cast, but the show is wearing borrowed clothes. It would be overstating the case to say Hytner\u2019s original had a sense of purpose \u2013 the show only ever aspired to be escapist fun \u2013 but there was method in its madness. Without that anarchic sensibility, the play comes across as a good deal more ordinary: less a knowing nod at the seaside-postcard values of early-60s British pop culture than an unmediated reproduction of the real thing.\n\nAs a jolly romp, it gives the audience a good time, but it lacks the animating spark to make it truly delirious.", "description": "Sarah Brigham\u2019s revival of Richard Bean\u2019s brilliant and chaotic comedy hoodwinks the audience into its games, but lacks the original\u2019s taste for danger", "authors": ["Mark Fisher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ae49e6ed5d8e5b9a964eadca2cd6d4ed76354a/0_298_5062_3038/master/5062.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db63eedd20295561e6193f996a9ca144", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
