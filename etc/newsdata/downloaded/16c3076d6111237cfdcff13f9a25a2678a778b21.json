The Redskins are 59-89-1 in Allen\u2019s tenure and are looking for their first win of the season in Miami.\n\n\u201cHelp Skins fans,\u201d the banner reads, \u201cFire Bruce Allen.\u201d\n\nThere is a \u201cFire Bruce Allen\u201d plane circling above Hard Rock Stadium this morning. pic.twitter.com/ZcyIDTtSWX \u2014 michael phillips (@michaelpRTD) October 13, 2019\n\nFlying over the stadium right now pic.twitter.com/grTiOIWjIT \u2014 Mark (@MtCowboyWy) October 13, 2019\n\nThe Redskins already made one significant change this season, firing coach Jay Gruden on Monday. But as of now, there is no indication that owner Dan Snyder plans to move on from Allen after the season.\n\nFans have long advocated for Allen\u2019s firing, including commenting \u201c#FireBruceAllen\u201d on the team\u2019s social media posts.\n\nIn January at the Senior Bowl, Allen was asked about those who wanted to see him fired.\n\n\u201cWhy am I the right person?\u201d Allen said. \u201cI share their passion for this franchise. I share the passion for the things that we can accomplish. And we\u2019re going to get this whole organization believing in it.\u201d\n\nAllen met with reporters after Gruden\u2019s dismissal last week, defending the team\u2019s culture as \u201cdamn good.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
