Fame came at a cost: the intimate moment of the bird\u2019s birth was shared online.\n\nThe gorgeous white-feathered gyrfalcon named Alpha came from Russia\u2019s Kamchatka, had champion hunting parents, and was personally gifted to King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud by Putin last Monday. The one thing that made her famous, however, was an embarrassing red-carpet incident, in which the bird got overexcited and relieved herself on the Saudi palace\u2019s floor.\n\nSome media jeered at the incident, suggesting that the falcon would face severe punishment and even accusing Russia of trafficking endangered species.\n\nAlso on rt.com Putin gives Saudi king a GYRFALCON as gift, but the moment is somewhat ruined (VIDEOS)\n\nResponding to claims that the bird was brought over to Riyadh \u201cillegally,\u201d the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment disclosed about the gyrfalcon\u2019s heritage. In a Facebook post, it explained that both Alpha and her sister, later gifted by Putin to UAE crown prince, were bred in a specialized Far Eastern falconry and had all the necessary documents and permissions to 'emigrate' to the Gulf monarchies.\n\nAs a bonus, the ministry enclosed a minute-long video that showed \u201cthe miracle of birth of this unique bird\u201d \u2013 that is, the moment Alpha\u2019s egg hatched. The original clip has since clocked nearly 20,000 views.\n\nAs for actual \u201crepercussions\u201d from the Saudi side, Alpha probably has little to fear: after all, the kingdom\u2019s royals are so obsessed with these prized birds of prey that sometimes entire commercial planes are being booked for their transportation. Any bird lovers out there would know that these flights too would have little chance of getting away clean.\n\nAlso on rt.com Putin gifts another gyrfalcon to UAE crown prince, after receiving lavish golden model (VIDEO)\n\nLike this story?
