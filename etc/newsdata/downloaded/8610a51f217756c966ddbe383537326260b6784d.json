RZSS/PA\n\nAfter completing the MBA, which required him to submit a dissertation, Mr Hussain applied to the Home Office for a post-work study visa \u2013 but this was refused in September 2012 on the grounds that he had submitted false documentation with his application, which he said came as a \u201ctotal shock\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was refused on the basis of deception. They put allegations that I could not speak English while I was doing an LSE degree. It was a nightmare,\u201d he says. \u201cI could not understand what had happened and how it happened. I had worked extremely hard and completed my dissertation.\u201d\n\nThe MBA had been illegitimate and the people running the course had been producing fraudulent certificates, which were then used by Mr Hussain and other students to make visa applications to the Home Office. Two men were later sentenced to prison for conspiracy and fraud.\n\n\u201cI was completely out of my mind. I was someone who had lost everything. The aim of my life, my parents\u2019 dreams, everything was ruined. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. I thought I\u2019d better leave now. There was no future here,\u201d Mr Hussain added.\n\nA month later, the Pakistani national, who at this point had a student visa valid for for another year, was asked to attend a meeting with the Home Office investigations team. He said he arrived with his luggage, ready to leave to return to Pakistan.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But this too was refused on the grounds that he had \u201cpreviously presented false documentation in an attempt to obtain leave to remain\u201d. He said the investigators then ceased to respond to his emails and calls.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson told The Independent they accepted that Mr Hussain was the victim of fraud, but that \u201cat no point was it suggested to [him] by Home Office staff that his testifying in the criminal proceedings would positively impact his immigration application\u201d.\n\nThey also said that he repeatedly failed to follow processes that are designed to safeguard international students, including failing to notify the department that he had changed colleges.\n\nWhen Mr Hussain disclosed the situation to his parents in Pakistan, he said they were \u201cdistraught\u201d: \u201cThey thought that I brought disappointment to the family. I tried to explain to them what had happened, but they wouldn\u2019t accept it. I was put into a situation where I couldn\u2019t explain to them what was going on.\n\n\u201cMy support from them was completely cut off. They cut off everything. My dad disowned me. He had every penny of earnings on me to get a better life and an education.\u201d\n\nThe Pakistani national continued to fight his case with the Home Office and through the courts, but has been refused at every stage.\n\nAfter a refusal in 2014, Mr Hussain said he attempted to take a lethal overdose, which was only prevented when his house mate found out and made him throw up. After this he moved to Manchester to stay with his cousin, where he has been living since and, without rights to work, relied on his charity.\n\nA statement from one of the Home Office investigators in July 2015 stated that Mr Hussain gave \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d and described how his life had been \u201cshattered\u201d by the actions of the two perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe worst aspect of the case were the students who were duped and believed that they had studied and Mr Hussain exemplified this with his victim statement,\u201d it read.\n\nMr Hussain said: \u201cI cannot understand what has happened and how this can happen to me, I was genuine, I am genuine and I will be genuine throughout my life. I have never submitted any false document and I cannot think about ever doing that.\n\n\u201cThis refusal has ruined my life and career and the reflection of this disappointment will remain with me forever. I am living under constant depression and fear that all future applications I make will be refused by the Home Office as they believe I have used deception.\n\n\u201cI have studied for the last four years in the UK and feel all my dedication and achievements in my studies have now amounted to nothing. The result of my blood and tears has ended up with nothing.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \u201cThis is an appalling story of misery being inflicted on this poor man. Under successive Tory governments the practice of the Home Office has become more complex, more arbitrary and less humane.\n\n\u201cThe government claims to have ended its \u2018hostile environment\u2019, but this case and many others show that they really haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d\n\nNazek Ramadan, director of Migrant Voice, said: \u201cThis is a particularly shocking example of how some Home Office decisions are needlessly ruining the lives of innocent, law-abiding people in this country.\n\n\u201cThe Home Office acknowledged that Muddasar is a victim of fraud, trusted him and used him as a key witness in their case against the fraudsters \u2013 then betrayed him, leaving him without status, without access to his rights, and without a future.\n\n\u201cHe has done everything asked of him, and more, yet he has been punished. The Home Office has made repeated promises to resolve his situation, but has repeatedly failed to do so.\n\n\u201cMuddasar\u2019s lost years are lost forever and the scars from this experience may never heal, but the government must now give him the right to stay, to work and to finish his studies \u2013 and the Home Office must be reformed so that no one else faces an injustice such as this.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we are sympathetic to his situation, he has no valid leave to remain in the country.\"", "description": "The victim of a college degree scam who helped the Home Office convict the perpetrators has been ordered to leave the UK in what has been described as an \u201cappalling story of misery\u201d.
