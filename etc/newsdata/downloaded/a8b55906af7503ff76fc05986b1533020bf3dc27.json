Discover the list of the world's 291 weirdest bands", "language": "en", "text": "The Nurse With Wound list is one of the greatest pieces of fieldwork ever conducted in music. It is a secret handshake, a map, a wishlist, and yet it still contains mysteries. A list of 291 artists, many of them unknown and unknowable pre-internet, was included in the 1979 debut album by the industrial group Nurse With Wound. Now 40 years old and legendary in underground circles, the label Finders Keepers are undertaking the Sisyphean task of collecting and compiling one track by every artist on it.\n\nNurse With Wound were associated with industrial music from its inception, although they were more interested in a surrealist sonic bricolage than the brutalism and didactic politics of their peers. While the group is now just Steven Stapleton, when the list was written it also featured John Fothergill and Heman Pathak. Along with studio engineer Nicky Rogers on guitar, their debut Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella was pressed in an edition of 500 after being recorded in six hours; Fothergill had owned a guitar for four days. Stapleton says they didn\u2019t expect to sell any \u2013 his cover art depicts a woman with whip and gimp mask, large breasts spilling from a full-body rubber suit. Unsurprisingly, some shops wouldn\u2019t stock it.\n\nFrench prog band Mahjun. Photograph: Finders Keepers\n\nInspired by the cover art on a German free jazz album by Wolfgang Dauner, which named all his inspirations and influences, the NWW list, included in the sleevenotes, was a cacophony of radical mind-altering music that Stapleton says had \u201cbroken barriers and been outlandish, or was completely and utterly original,\u201d a map of their discoveries in European outsider music, one drawn as that music was being made. \u201cWe honed it down and put it in,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then nobody gave a shit, basically\u201d.\n\nGoing back to the records he loved for the Finder\u2019s Keepers compilation, he says he is still blown away by how fresh all this music sounds, and is getting reacquainted with records he used to know by heart. \u201cThat period was just so fertile,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s not really nostalgia for me, it\u2019s more like revisiting old friends.\u201d\n\nThe list is krautrock heavy, with French prog, British improv, outr\u00e9 Italian pop, post-punk, noise music, and stuff that doesn\u2019t easily fit anywhere, such as the mind-blowing vocal cut-ups and collages of Gh\u00e9dalia Tazart\u00e8s, or the rapturous jams of Japanese performance group Tokyo Kid Brothers. The NWW list contains irresistible band names such as Horrific Child, Lard Free, and Ovary Lodge, alongside legends like Yoko Ono and Frank Zappa. Stapleton once said some of the names didn\u2019t exist, although Fothergill disputes this. In fact, Stapleton admits they\u2019re both right, as one of the groups (he won\u2019t tell me which) never recorded or released anything bar one track, so whether they existed is debatable.\n\nGo deep enough, and the stories behind these groups, whether legendary or forgotten, are wormholes in themselves. A psych jam by the Yo Ha Wha 13 will lead you to the story of a free love cult that invented organic eating. Dig around the British improv entries and you\u2019ll eventually find an album by TV comedian Vic Reeves. Dutch drummer Han Bennink (still very active) has been known to play drum kits made of cheese. You\u2019ll hear Pierre Henry, who inspired the Futurama theme; the French Nico in Catherine Ribeiro; the French Ella Fitzgerald in Colette Magny; and Alvaro, dubbed \u201cthe Chilean with the singing nose\u201d, an exile from the Pinochet regime who played with Joe Strummer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jean-Pierre Massiera, AKA Horrific Child. Photograph: Finders Keepers\n\nWhen the list was written, Stapleton, Pathak and Fothergill were already well schooled in the art of digging at home and abroad, scouring the racks for anything unusual. \u201cEvery tiny snippet of information you could find back then was really important,\u201d explains Stapleton. Krautrock had replaced his teenage cacti obsession some years before \u2013 in David Keenan\u2019s book England\u2019s Hidden Reverse, he describes how he dropped out of art school and spent a year \u201csurrounded by my fish tanks, listening to Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl and wanking. That was the year I lost interest in cacti.\u201d After this epiphany, he went to Europe aged 17, where he stayed with producer Conny Plank and roadied for Guru Guru, the Germans apparently intrigued by a strange British teenager who was interested in their music when nobody else was.\n\nIt took until the 90s for the list to catch on, but when it did, its influence spread far beyond what Stapleton and Fothergill could have expected. Forty years later, it\u2019s responsible for forging a scene in itself and for emptying the wallets of record collectors the world over. \u201cIt became a directory for record collectors, and then, as the list became popular, those obscure records were reissued on CD,\u201d Stapleton explains. It\u2019s been covered in depth on underground radio stations WFMU and Resonance FM, even on the BBC. Legendary California chain Amoeba Records has shelves dedicated to it. European online record shop SoundOhm has an entire section, as if it was a genre in itself \u2013 when contacted for this piece, the store\u2019s owner Fabio Carboni compared its impact to the invention of the sextant in maritime navigation. Keenan describes it as \u201cthe ultimate outsider musical education\u201d.\n\nFinders Keepers boss Andy Votel \u2013 who wanted to call the compilation NWW That\u2019s What I Call Music \u2013 describes the list as a \u201cphantom\u201d in record collecting, because the NWW tag haunted the racks. \u201cAs that very male record collector thing goes, you want to think that you\u2019re on to things before other people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Steve Stapleton was always there first. It was before DJ culture, it was before mixtape culture. That makes it truly amazing.\u201d\n\nThe NWW list doesn\u2019t cover a particularly broad demographic, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Like Julian Cope\u2019s Japrock and Krautrock samplers, or the Her Noise map, the NWW list is not about a finished whole, but about ecstatic beginnings for curious ears. It is about beginnings for Stapleton in another way, too \u2013 he has inadvertently played a long game in record collecting, and is now using the proceeds from selling his rare vinyl to build a house in Clare, Ireland, \u201cnear the Father Ted house\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have maybe 1,000 albums left, but most of the rare ones are gone,\u201d he says. \u201cI could not believe the prices of some of them.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Strain Crack & Break: Music From the Nurse With Wound List: Volume I (France) is out now on Finders Keepers.", "description": "Industrial group Nurse With Wound included a list of ultra-obscure artists on their debut album \u2013 and inadvertently created a treasure hunt for record nerds", "authors": ["Jennifer Lucy Allan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043edb3fd454f53a2d0e3cf81084bc297d5df47a/123_905_7210_4324/master/7210.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=913ce55588008745e0b55c369fc7d02b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
