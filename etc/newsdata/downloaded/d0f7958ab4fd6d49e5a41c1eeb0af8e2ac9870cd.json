Much of the violence has been fueled by anger over police conduct, made worse after an officer shot a teenage protester in the chest with a live round during clashes on Oct. 1, the politically sensitive anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nBut to their critics, these protesters are crossing the line by playing the role of vigilantes to punish those they consider their foes. The intensity of the unrest could alienate moderate supporters and members of the public, and play to Beijing\u2019s depictions of the movement as the work of riotous mobs.\n\n\u201cSome people began to take matters into their own hands,\u201d said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He pointed in part to the protesters\u2019 frustration that the police have in large part failed to arrest and prosecute pro-government thugs who attacked demonstrators.\n\nYet, he added, in recent days, the movement has been debating whether such retributive violence is morally justifiable.", "description": "A breakdown in trust in Hong Kong\u2019s government and the police force has driven some protesters to retributive violence.
