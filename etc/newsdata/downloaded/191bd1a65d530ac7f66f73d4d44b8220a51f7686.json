(AP) - Army coach Jeff Monken is back in a good frame of mind after a bye week, but the memory of a sloppy comeback victory over a team from college football\u2019s second tier still lingers.\n\nTwo turnovers, too many missed blocks and some shaky pass coverage in a 52-21 win over Championship Division foe Morgan State aren\u2019t so easy to forget as midseason nears.\n\n\u201cIt felt nice to get a win, a little bit frustrating with the way we kind of found ourselves getting to that victory,\u201d Monken said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ve corrected some of those errors and improved as a team.\u201d\n\nTulane (3-1) visits on Saturday and likely will offer some answers. The Green Wave, also coming off a bye, are off to their best start in 16 years and have beaten Army (3-1) two straight times, including 21-17 two years ago with a touchdown in the final minute.\n\n\u201cThe last time we played Tulane, they scored on the first play of the game on a 75-yard touchdown run ,\u201d Monken recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough way to start a game, so we\u2019re going to need to start better.\u201d\n\nThe Green Wave, whose only loss was to Auburn, are coming off an impressive 38-31 home win over Houston. Tulane overcame a 21-point deficit and won the game with help from a trick play that set up Jalen McCleskey\u2019s 53-yard catch-and-run touchdown with 3 seconds left.\n\nTulane is favored in the game despite Army\u2019s spotless home record and coach Willie Fritz has tried to keep everything on an even keel.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really talked to them all that much,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cIt is just about consistent behavior by me, the coaching staff and the senior leaders. You have to drown out the noise. You just have to worry about what is good for the team _ it is very simplistic.\u201d\n\nOther things to know when Tulane visits Army on Saturday:\n\nSTREAKING\n\nArmy is riding a 15-game winning streak at Michie Stadium as the Black Knights seek to go undefeated at home for the third straight season.\n\n\u201cWhen we trot out to Michie, the expectation that you\u2019re going to win is just a different type of energy level, confidence that you carry in as a group,\u201d senior linebacker Cole Christiansen said.\n\nRUN, RUN, RUN\n\nExpect the game to whiz by. Led by the trio of dual-threat QB Justin McMillan, Darius Bradwell and Corey Dauphine (each over 200 yards rushing), the Green Wave have rushed for over 250 yards three times while Army\u2019s triple option is averaging 293.5 yards.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is be able to run the football effectively, which is the way that we\u2019ve been able to have success here,\u201d Monken said. \u201cSustain drives, score touchdowns, and to try to keep them from doing the same. It\u2019s something that they\u2019ve been really good at.\u201d\n\nAdded Fritz: \u201cYou just have to make every series count. The clock is going to be running and you just have to take advantage of every single play.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019S UNDER CENTER?\n\nArmy starting quarterback Kelvin Hopkins Jr. has missed the last two games with a leg injury but is back practicing. Jabari Laws got the nod against Morgan State but was knocked out of the game by a blindsided hit and was relieved by Christian Anderson. All three are ready to go, and Hopkins is itching to return.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as fun as I remember (to sit). You just feel like you could be out there helping the guys,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard when you\u2019ve kind of been out there for a year and a half and standing there and watching things happen.\u201d\n\nTURNOVERS GALORE\n\nThough Army\u2019s lone loss was in double overtime at then-No. 7 Michigan, the Black Knights have been careless with the ball, losing seven fumbles to go with one interception. That\u2019s a notable switch from the previous two seasons (10 lost fumbles combined), which produced 21 victories and last year a national ranking (No. 19) at season\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very cognizant of the fact that we\u2019ve turned it over at a much higher rate,\u201d Monken said. \u201cHanging onto the ball has helped us win a lot of football games. Hopefully, we\u2019ve seen the last of them.\u201d\n\nTulane has just four turnovers _ two lost fumbles and two interceptions _ and its defense has forced eight.\n\nFAMILIAR FACES\n\nFritz coached Georgia Southern for two years after Monken departed for West Point in 2013, Tulane defensive coordinator Jack Curtis served in that role under Monken for the last three years of Monken\u2019s tenure at Georgia Southern, and two current Army assistants played for Fritz in college.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting dynamic,\u201d Monken said. \u201cWe know that they are going to be very well-prepared.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Army coach Jeff Monken is back in a good frame of mind after a bye week, but the memory of a sloppy comeback victory over a team from college football\u2019s second tier still lingers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Kekis"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/houston_tulane_football_67486_c0-103-2462-1538_s1770x1032.jpg?77c104a86631214a3c6d08ee8b0bc20486d344c0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
