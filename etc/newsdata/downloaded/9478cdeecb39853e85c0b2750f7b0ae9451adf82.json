Wales ended a 10-year, 13-match losing streak at the hands of the Wallabies and beat them again in pool play in Japan.\n\nEngland and Ireland also won test series in Australia.\n\nIn games between the Six Nations sides and those from the Rugby Championship from 2016, the European teams have won 42 of the 79 matches. More than half the 37 losses against southern hemisphere sides were suffered by France (12) and Italy (eight).\n\nWhile Wales have won nine of their 15 games against the Rugby Championship sides, four of their six losses have come at the hands of the All Blacks and they have beaten the Springboks all four times they have played since 2016.\n\nEngland have an even better record in the last four years.\n\nThey have lost just three times in 18 games against southern hemisphere nations since the last World Cup \u2014 two to South Africa and in their only game against the All Blacks last year, something coach Eddie Jones is eager to rectify in Yokohama.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Rugby Union - Rugby World Cup 2019 - Quarter Final - New Zealand v Ireland - Tokyo Stadium, Tokyo, Japan - October 19, 2019 New Zealand players celebrate after the match REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cLook at what we\u2019ve done as a team over the last four years, we\u2019ve had some great wins, we\u2019ve had some significant losses. We have learnt from those.\n\n\u201cProgressively, we\u2019ve built a game that we think we can take New Zealand. We\u2019re just excited by the possibility.\u201d", "description": "At the last Rugby World Cup in 2015, the southern hemisphere nations highlighted a gap with their northern counterparts after none of the Six Nations teams advanced to the semi-finals for the first time.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444065249&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0Q6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
