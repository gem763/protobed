I\u2019ve resurfaced a few of them below, including discounts on waterproof Kindles (without Amazon\u2019s annoying ads built-in), and a Ring Video Doorbell that comes with an Echo Dot smart speaker. There are other good deals to sort through, like Google Play Store\u2019s big sale, and a refurbished iPad Pro (2018) that\u2019s hundreds off of its regular price.\n\nThe previous generation of Kindle Oasis with 8GB of storage and no special offers (i.e., Amazon\u2019s lockscreen ads) is $174.99 (usually $249.99) at Best Buy. This is $75 cheaper than the latest generation Oasis, which differs only in its display that allows adjustable warmth to be easier on the eyes.\n\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite with 8GB of storage and special offers costs $84.99 (usually $129.99) at Best Buy. It\u2019s much cheaper than the Oasis, and comes with a display that\u2019s just as pixel-dense (300ppi). It\u2019s also waterproof.\n\nThe Ring Video Doorbell is $69.99 at Best Buy (usually $99.99) and includes a free Echo Dot (third-generation) with purchase.\n\nDaily Steals is offering some good prices on refurbished tech, and readers of The Verge can save an extra $10 on anything on this page with the offer code VERGEBOUT. If you just want the highlights, the 11-inch iPad Pro is one of them. The tablet with 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi + LTE connectivity is $669.99 (usually $949). The 256GB configuration that supports Wi-Fi and LTE is $769.99, just over $300 off the usual price.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these iPad Pros are refurbished. They\u2019re in \u201cGrade A\u201d condition, which Daily Steals says translates to excellent condition, but may have \u201cminor scuffs of scratch marks on the casing\u201d. Each tablet includes a 90-day warranty, and adding a two-year warranty to the purchase will cost $96.99.\n\nGoogle Play is hosting deals on apps, in-game purchases, audiobooks, television series bundles, books, and movies. You can check out all of the sales right here, but my favorite pick is The Americans (seasons 1-6 in FHD resolution) is $35.99.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this show, you should make it a priority. It\u2019s a masterclass in pacing and character development. Plus, the elevator pitch is just so fun: two KGB spies (and their totally unassuming kids) move to Washington DC in the midst of the Cold War to steal intel from the FBI. Their next-door neighbor just so happens to be an FBI agent. Incredible tension ensues, and it doesn\u2019t let up for six seasons.", "description": "You can save some money this weekend on Amazon products, like the Kindle Paperwhite and Oasis, as well as Ring\u2019s Video Doorbell.
