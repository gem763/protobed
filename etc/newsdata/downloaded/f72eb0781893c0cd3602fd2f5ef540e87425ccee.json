Here's what you need to know as you start your Monday ...\n\nRussia brokers deal between Kurds and Damascus to stem Turkish offensive: report; Trump seeing 'consensus' in new sanctions on Turkey\n\nNearly a week after the U.S. announced its decision to pull out troops from northern Syria to make way for a Turkish incursion, Kurdish forces in the country have reportedly agreed to a new deal with Damascus in a desperate bid to face off against Ankara's offensive. The New York Times reported that the deal-- which was announced Sunday evening-- would enable President Bashar al-Assad's forces to attempt to regain a foothold in the country's northeast. The Washington Post reported that the deal was reached after three days of negotiations between the Kurdish forces, Russian envoys and Damascus.

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper defended Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces and said the U.S. is urging Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to cease the aggression.\n\nEsper said that roughly 1,000 troops will be withdrawing from the north of the country. A U.S. official told Fox News that forces will not be leaving the country altogether, but will be moving southward. Meanwhile, in a series of tweets, Trump himself denounced getting involved in \"endless wars\" and talked up wide support in Washington in imposing news sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\u2018Where\u2019s Hunter?\u2019 Trump asks, as Biden\u2019s son promises not to work with foreign companies if father wins presidency in 2020\n\nPresident Trump targeted Hunter Biden Sunday morning, implying that the son of former Vice President Joe Biden has disappeared -- hours after Hunter Biden's attorney announced his client is stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and vowed that he will not work with foreign companies if his father becomes president. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? He has totally disappeared!\u201d Trump tweeted. Trump and his own attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, have accused Hunter Biden of improperly benefiting from business dealings in China and Ukraine while Joe Biden was vice president.\n\nMexico halts caravan of 2,000 migrants bound for US\n\nA caravan of roughly 2,000 migrants bound for the United States was halted by Mexican authorities over the weekend only a few hours into their journey, according to officials. The caravan, which consisted of migrants from Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America, left before dawn Saturday from Tapachula, a town in southern Mexico near the Guatemalan border, Reuters reported. About 24 miles into their journey, federal police and national guardsmen blocked their path. The abrupt halt of the caravan stood in stark contrast to last year when waves of U.S.-bound caravans \u2013 including one of at least 7,000 people \u2013 drew widespread media coverage while immigration officials on both sides of the border struggled to stem the flow.\n\nChina's trade with US shrinks again in September\n\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China continues to take a toll on the Chinese economy and threatens to tip the global economy into recession. China's trade with the United States fell by double digits again in September. Exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, fell 17.8 percent to $36.5 billion, a deterioration from August's 16 percent decline, customs data showed Monday. Imports of American goods sank 20.6 percent from the year before to $10.6 billion, a slight improvement over August's 22 percent decline.\n\nMaster Sgt.
