It enacted a tax targeting large U.S. tech companies \u2013 including Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \u2013 that are earning massive global profits. For years these multinational enterprises have avoided paying corporate taxes in the U.S., thanks to shell operations in tax havens like the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. But France is tired of seeing these companies get away with large-scale tax avoidance. And so the French government has started imposing a digital tax on them. It\u2019s estimated the new tax could bring in over $500 million annually for the French treasury.\n\nIt\u2019s not just France, however. More than 20 European countries are poised to impose digital taxes on large U.S. tech companies. It\u2019s their specific response to the pervasive tax avoidance practiced by large American multinationals.\n\nThe irony is that the U.S. government continues to be a big loser when it comes to corporate tax avoidance. In 2017, U.S. multinationals held an estimated $2.6 trillion of profits in their foreign subsidiaries on which they paid no U.S. taxes. And only a portion of that money has actually returned to the U.S. through repatriation established by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. Each year, this profit shifting allows foreign and American multinationals to avoid paying roughly $80 billion in U.S. corporate taxes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBecause corporate tax avoidance has become a major headache for western governments, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has now waded into the issue. Unfortunately, it appears that the OECD\u2019s response is merely a compromise system that will still allow for some corporate tax avoidance.\n\nIt\u2019s time to fully tax the profits that all multinational companies earn from their U.S. sales. And so, rather than simply follow France\u2019s digital tax, Congress should adopt a more effective system. It should emulate the tax approach utilized by various states in the U.S., something known as Sales Factor Apportionment (SFA). Doing so could establish American leadership on the issue while also helping domestic American companies.\n\nAn SFA system assesses corporate tax liability based on profits earned from U.S. sales. Essentially, all companies selling a product or service in the U.S. market would be required to pay taxes on the profits earned from those sales \u2014 no matter where they might be domiciled. And so, it wouldn\u2019t matter where a company is chartered. They would simply face a corporate tax on any U.S. profits.\n\nDomestic American companies are already taxed in exactly this manner. And so, an SFA system would merely require that multinational companies finally play by the same rules. This is a logical approach to taxing multinational entities, and it would finally and adequately assess the huge profits that multinationals earn from easy access to America\u2019s consumers.\n\nEurope could learn from this, too. Research by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA) has found that, if France adopted an SFA system, it could double the tax revenues it is now attempting to collect from large tech companies. And that would certainly be fairer than arbitrarily targeting only American companies.\n\nMultinational enterprises have mixed opinions on how much of their profit should fall under an apportioned system. But Washington can establish global leadership by rewriting a biased and ineffective tax system rather than let it continue to allow unfair, large-scale corporate tax avoidance. A U.S. system of sales factor apportionment would bring in increased corporate tax revenues and set a helpful precedent for other developed nations looking to solve a similar challenge.\n\nDavid Morse is the tax policy director at the Coalition for a Prosperous America Education Fund.
