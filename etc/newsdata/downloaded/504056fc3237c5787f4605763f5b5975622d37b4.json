They talked about everything from design trends, to marketing, to revenue models \u2014 including the revenue model that Andrew is least interested in right now.\n\nYou can find my notes analyzing the conversation below, including Chen\u2019s view of consumer SaaS, how he thinks about marketing channels now, key verticals like AR/VR, esports and housing. And ads.\n\nConsumer design is taking over the workplace\n\nAs work apps like Slack and Zoom grow more and more popular, it\u2019s no longer the norm for the apps we use at work to be ugly, confusing messes. A big part of this is driven, Chen says, by designers from the popular consumer developers moving into enterprise.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that the things that were really interesting and exciting ten years ago have completely morphed\u201d says Chen. \u201cIt used to be that, you know, you had hundreds of teams that were working on a new photo sharing app or a new messaging app or whatever.
