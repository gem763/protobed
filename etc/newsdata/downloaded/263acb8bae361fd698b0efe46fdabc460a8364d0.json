I can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ve got no other skillset!\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Over her 10-year standup career, Hannah Gadsby had played to more than a few thin midweek houses. So when she was making her 2017 show Nanette, and beginning to sense it might be rather good, the Australian comic dared to dream an impossible dream. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Wow, it would be great to be able to not worry about whether I\u2019ll sell the room on a Wednesday.\u201d\n\nReader: her dreams came true \u2013 and then some. Nanette, a disavowal of comedy (its lies and omissions, the damage it can do) disguised as a standup show, became one of the major entertainment events of the decade. It won the biggest prizes at the Melbourne and Edinburgh comedy festivals, toured the world, and its Netflix special became a cultural phenomenon, earning Gadsby a best writing award at last month\u2019s Emmys. Far from worrying if anyone will show up, she now counts Emma Thompson and Monica Lewinsky among her many famous fans. \u201cIt really is mind-boggling what\u2019s happened to me,\u201d says Gadsby, mid-tour and cheerful on the phone from the US. \u201cLiterally my mind is boggling.\u201d Then \u2013 never one to leave an imprecision hanging \u2013 she qualifies: \u201cActually that\u2019s not literal: I don\u2019t know what boggling means.\u201d\n\nThe show she is touring is her first post-Nanette offering, entitled Douglas. It is playing to audiences far bigger than Gadsby had become used to (even the Wednesdays are selling), and will land in the UK this month. As we shall see, it\u2019s a reaction to the furore around its predecessor, as well as a placeholder while Gadsby calculates what to do with her new status. She has not adjusted to it yet \u2013 her life has changed beyond recognition \u2013 and is still puzzling over what made Nanette so profound an experience for so many.\n\n\u201cAs I toured Nanette,\u201d she reflects, \u201cthe #MeToo movement hit its straps. There was a zeitgeist that made it blow up like it did.\u201d Nanette was about Gadsby\u2019s sometimes brutal experiences of sexism and homophobia, particularly in her native Tasmania. With meticulous control, it spoke about how she turned those experiences into jokes \u2013 and, by doing so, collaborated in her own oppression. At least to begin with, it didn\u2019t stint on classic one-liners (\u201cI\u2019m not lesbian enough \u2026 I mean, I keep my hand in\u201d) but it repurposed them to radical effect (\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be a straight white man if you paid me, although the pay would be substantially better\u201d). Then \u2013 bait-and-switch successfully accomplished \u2013 it set the gags aside, and instead delivered a savage critique of how comedy works and which stories it will and won\u2019t let us tell.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hannah Gadsby performing Nanette. Photograph: Ben King/Netflix\n\nThat may be why, Gadsby speculates, a lot of people \u201cwho don\u2019t feel catered for by standup as it has usually been\u201d flocked to her show. \u201cBut also,\u201d she admits, wrestling with the reasons for Nanette\u2019s impact, \u201cI have no idea. I could give you a lot of theories. I put a lot of work into that show. It\u2019s not an accidental piece of work. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you what the recipe was that made it land like it did.\u201d\n\nIf the explanation is elusive, there is no doubt about the show\u2019s transformative effect on the 41-year-old\u2019s life. Gadsby was a respected fringe-festival regular. Her style was downbeat bordering on dour, with the low energy redeemed by forensic wit (often at her own expense) and the kind of heavy sardonicism signalled by 2011\u2019s show title Mrs Chuckles. It all added up to a credible \u2013 if not lucrative \u2013 standup career: until Nanette, she \u201cdidn\u2019t believe I\u2019d ever be able to afford a home of my own\u201d.\n\nThe show\u2019s success put the kibosh on Gadsby\u2019s plan to retire from standup. She made the \u201cI quit\u201d announcement onstage as part of the show; it was a key part of Nanette\u2019s excoriating effect. Now, she reclassifies that as a theatrical device. \u201cIt became this very odd mix of a conceit and also: \u2018I mean it.\u2019 What it meant was: \u2018I don\u2019t care about my reputation as a comedian. I don\u2019t care about the artform of comedy. I care more about what I\u2019m saying, not how I am saying it.\u2019 But it became cathartic for me to say it onstage and kind of believe it.\u201d She pauses, then \u2013 as if she needs to justify still being a comedian \u2013 adds: \u201cbut also: what am I going to do? Sit on a park bench? I can\u2019t quit. I\u2019ve no other skill set.\u201d\n\nSo here she still is, a full-time, gigging comedian, albeit one whose sense of herself has changed dramatically. \u201cBefore Nanette,\u201d she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like a powerful person at all. I was always very low status. And now I have high status. I have a platform, and a lot of people will read or listen to what I say. I am not, as an individual, oppressed any more,\u201d she says, the amazement audible in her voice. \u201cBut I still represent a collection of identities that are oppressed minorities.\u201d\n\nHannah Gadsby's Nanette dares to dream of a different future \u2013 for ourselves and comedy | Jane Howard Read more\n\nAs an art history graduate (she has made shows on the subject; one of Nanette\u2019s most pointed routines was about Picasso), it amuses Gadsby \u2013 a self-described \u201cbig queer woman from a low socio-economic background\u201d \u2013 that her work is now canonical. \u201cIt\u2019s really funny to me that if there\u2019s a canon of comedy \u2013 which is not an idea I\u2019m a fan of \u2013 then I\u2019ve just sort of plopped myself in there.\u201d\n\nBut the adjustment she is having to make is practical as well as conceptual. Her life is busier and harder to navigate now \u2013 which is not easy for a woman who has been vocal in the past about her social unease. \u201cI am finding it hard,\u201d she agrees, \u201cbecause I like familiarity and there\u2019s not much about my life just now that is familiar.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to Douglas, one of the standout themes of which is Gadsby\u2019s autism. She was diagnosed as autistic just before she made Nanette. It made sense of her lifelong feeling that her brain worked differently \u2013 an understanding that in turn helped her make her breakout show. Now she is addressing it directly onstage. Because \u201cpeople don\u2019t understand autism,\u201d she says, \u201cparticularly the experience of women on the spectrum. Medicine has not prioritised the study of the female experience at all.\u201d The show is named after the so-called Pouch of Douglas, a part of the female anatomy \u201cdiscovered\u201d by 18th-century midwife James Douglas. (Douglas is also the name of the comedian\u2019s dog.)\n\nBeyond the gender issue, the show finds Gadsby \u201ctrying to pull into focus the ableism that is inherent in the structures we have to navigate. There is an assumption that if you\u2019re not typical then you\u2019re a burden,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s an arrogant assumption.\u201d\n\nThat may give the impression that Douglas is as serious-minded as Nanette \u2013 which very much isn\u2019t the case, says Gadsby. \u201cIt\u2019s really playful, she says. \u201cI\u2019m having more fun onstage. Which is important for me, because I put myself through the wringer performing Nanette.\u201d In Douglas, she riffs on men who play golf, her unlikely new life in LA \u2013 and Where\u2019s Wally. (\u201c[He] should have to find himself like the rest of us do.\u201d) Intentionally or otherwise, the lighter tone addresses the most common criticism of Nanette, which is that, because of its seriousness, it wasn\u2019t comedy \u2013 and Gadsby, by implication, wasn\u2019t a comedian at all.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paws for thought... Gadsby with Jasper and Douglas. Photograph: Meredith O'Shea\n\nThat arose in part, she says, from the \u201cvery different comedy culture [in the States]. In Australia and the UK, where comedians have long been writing concept shows and pushing boundaries, Nanette was not that unusual. But in the land of Netflix specials, it was very different.\u201d But far from losing sleep over the criticism, which she sees as just another attempt to silence a non-mainstream voice, Gadsby addresses it in her new show. \u201cI really enjoy the anatomy of hate,\u201d she says, then corrects herself. \u201cNot enjoy, but I\u2019m fascinated by it. I like to hold what people throw at me and study it and bring it to the stage.\u201d Or, as she has said elsewhere: \u201cWhy not troll the trolls?\u201d\n\nAt any rate, she is having fun with Douglas, developing a show in front of her vast new audience, who are \u201cvery happy in the auditorium before I\u2019ve even done anything\u201d, she marvels. \u201cWhich makes the job easier.\u201d She sounds like an artist wholly liberated, her Nanette journey having convinced her that \u201cwe really don\u2019t know what audiences want, because we\u2019ve stopped asking them. I thought Nanette was going to be really divisive. But instead audiences went: \u2018We really like this!\u2019 And I think that\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\nSo what is Gadsby going to do with these legions of new fans \u2013 and with an entertainment world that is, all of a sudden, at her feet? Well, she is clearly not going to squander the principles that got her here in the first place. \u201cI am now personally a rich and powerful white woman,\u201d she says, hooting with laughter at the thought. \u201cAnd I have to be careful about that. My platform has always been: I hate people who abuse their power. I want to keep speaking to these identities that I still see as being vulnerable.\u201d\n\nArtistically as well, \u201cit\u2019s important for me,\u201d she says, \u201cnot to protect where I\u2019ve got to. Not to write and perform from the standpoint of: \u2018I need to hold on to this new patch.\u2019 I want my stance still to be: it\u2019s more important to care about what you\u2019re saying than where it\u2019s going to get you.\u201d\n\nJust as it has been exciting to look on as Gadsby\u2019s life has transformed overnight, it is a thrill to watch her unpick that success and puzzle over how to use it. What seems certain is that she will remain one of comedy\u2019s most considered and critical voices. And that, however she deploys her newfound celebrity, it won\u2019t be accidental. \u201cI have a lot at my fingertips,\u201d she says. \u201cI did take some meetings in Hollywood. And I ended up feeling: I don\u2019t know what I want to do. But I know I don\u2019t want to do something just because I can.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to make sure that what I do is something I can do well. And that will give to the world more than it takes. For now,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m having a think about that. And I\u2019m taking my time.\u201d\n\nHannah Gadsby plays New Theatre, Oxford, Thursday 24; Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Friday 25 October; touring to 23 November", "description": "The comic was due to retire, until her show Nanette made her an overnight star.
