Marrero gave them until next Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that enforcement of the subpoena may adversely affect federal interests of constitutional dimension, those effects could not be redressed after the fact,\u201d the prosecutors said.\n\nLawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said any delay is damaging, particularly because statute of limitations regarding potential charges are in play.\n\nCarey Dunne, Vance\u2019s general counsel, said the grand jury is looking at conduct engaged in by a wide variety of parties and businesses.\n\nAttorney William Consovoy, representing Trump , said the president is immune from any criminal investigation as long as he is in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe idea that any state, New York or any other, could decide that they would indict a sitting president, there is no support for that while he is president,\u201d he said.\n\nThe subpoena seeking returns issued as part of Vance\u2019s investigation into the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in buying the silence of two women who could have embarrassed the president with stories of extramarital affairs during his 2016 campaign.\n\nSee also: Trump repeatedly asked Ukraine president to investigate Biden\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have assailed the investigation as politically motivated, saying Vance, a Democrat, is \u201ccharging down this blatantly unconstitutional path\u201d purely to harass the president.\n\nAttorneys for Vance say that the investigation is valid, and that if the court fully accepts Trump\u2019s argument, it would mean that presidents would not have to comply with grand jury subpoenas regarding their conduct out of office, and could also extend that immunity to associates and employees.\n\n\u201cThe law provides no such sweeping immunity,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to investigate presidents and remove them from office, but the law over whether a sitting president can be indicted and prosecuted in a state or federal court is unsettled.\n\nVance launched his investigation after federal prosecutors ended their investigation into payments that Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged for the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal to keep them quiet during the presidential race. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Cohen for his work.\n\nVance\u2019s inquiry is said to be examining whether the payments or reimbursements broke any state laws.\n\nSee also: How the top U.S. newspapers are covering the impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nThe Trump Organization complied with an earlier round of subpoenas seeking records related to its dealings with Cohen, who pleaded guilty to separate federal campaign law violations, but Trump balked when the prosecutors subpoenaed his accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns.\n\nUniversity of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said the White House strategy was likely aimed at delaying litigation rather than airing out thorny legal issues.\n\n\u201cThe White House has a blanket \u2018no\u2019 on everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, they\u2019re not going to be able to stop all of them. I think they\u2019re just trying to run out the clock, get him reelected.\u201d", "description": "The tax return fight is playing out as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launches a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX224_17trum_ZG_20171029163452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
