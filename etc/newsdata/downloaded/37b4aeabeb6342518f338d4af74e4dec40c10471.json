impact for Nigeria\u2019s economy", "language": "en", "text": "Lagos (AFP) \u2013 Two months ago, Nigeria slapped restrictions on cross-border trade with its neighbours, but there are mixed signals as to whether the controversial move is benefitting the country.\n\nOn August 19, President Muhammadu Buhari dramatically closed Nigeria\u2019s land frontiers to goods traded with Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger, saying its economy needed to be protected from rampant smuggling.\n\nThe move has met with howls of pain in Benin especially, and cast a shadow over a newly-minted agreement to scrap restrictions on trade among African economies.\n\nBut has it been beneficial for Nigeria, as the government has sought?\n\nEvidence seen by AFP suggests that any benefits are at the macro level \u2014 and the country\u2019s many poor are likely to be among the losers.\n\nThe two main commodities being smuggled were petrol and rice.\n\nPetrol was being sneaked out from Nigeria, where subsidies make the fuel half as cheap as in its neighbours, and resold.\n\nRice, on the other hand, was being brought into Nigeria, where consumers favour imported Asian-grown varieties over the locally-grown competitor, from Benin via its port in Cotonou.\n\nThe most visible winner from the closure is the Nigerian treasury, which has benefitted from the falling cost of petrol subsidies and from a rise in customs receipts.\n\n\u201cNigeria, to its detriment, may have inadvertently subsidised (fuel) supply to a few West African countries for more than 12 years,\u201d the Nigerian consultancy Cardinal Stone said in a report this month.\n\nSales of gasoline in Nigeria fell by 12.7 percent after the border closure, which indicates that millions of subsidised litres (gallons) are being secretly taken abroad for resale, it said.\n\nThe reduction in consumption, if sustained, could lead to subsidy savings of around 13.5 billion naira ($37 million, 34 million euros) monthly and 162.1 billion naira annually, it estimated.\n\nIn early October, Nigeria\u2019s customs chief, Hameed Ali, said customs receipts had reached a record level, of five billion naira daily, since the closure, with the bustling port of Lagos benefitting most as imports rise through official channels.\n\n\u2013 Gain and pain \u2013\n\nAs for rice, the country\u2019s agriculture lobby is loudly supporting the border closure.\n\nAde Adefeko, a senior executive in charge of corporate relations with the food giant Olam, said investment in Nigerian agriculture was being hamstrung by the rice trafficking, which is estimated to reach two million tonnes a year.\n\nOlam has the biggest rice-growing business in Nigeria, owning 13,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of cultivable land of which only 4,500 ha. are being used because the sector is \u201cnot profitable\u201d in the face of competition from Asian rice, he said.\n\nBut \u201csince the border closure, locally-milled rice has started selling, and the entire rice value chain has been positively impacted by the closure,\u201d Adefeko said.\n\nHe called for the border closure to be maintained \u201cuntil the end of the year, and see how it goes on a longer term.\u201d\n\nThe customs chief Ali on Monday told reporters there was no \u201ctime limit\u2026 It will continue as long as we can get the desired results.\u201d\n\nBut if the border closure is a boost for domestic growers, it has led to price increases for consumers.\n\nThe price of a 50-kilo (110-pound) bag has more than doubled to 20,000 naira, roughly the entire monthly income of a Nigerian living in extreme poverty \u2014 of whom there are an estimated 87 million in the country.\n\nTraders in Lagos Island, a vast market of Made in China textiles and gadgets, say the closure of the borders had crimped supplies via Benin\u2019s Cotonou.\n\n\u201cLagos port is too slow and you have to pay too many bribes to get your goods out,\u201d said a swimsuit hawker. \u201cI have to cut down my margin by half.\u201d\n\nThe annual inflation rate has edged up to 11.24 percent in September, while food inflation ran at 13.51 percent.\n\n\u2013 Filling a role \u2013\n\nA similar complaint is heard among people in Nigeria\u2019s industrial sector, which is already struggling with the country\u2019s notoriously poor transport system and electricity shortages.\n\nTrade with neighbours is essential, they say.\n\n\u201cThe intention of stopping smuggling is praiseworthy but the point is that measures have an impact on us,\u201d said a foreign investor who specialises in the import and export of manufactured goods.\n\n\u201cAs usual in Nigeria, it\u2019s all down to a question of strength \u2014 you crush first and talk later.\u201d\n\nBetween 10 and 20 percent of Nigerian manufactured goods are sold to other countries in West Africa, with many of these items, such as pasta and cosmetics, exported through informal routes, mainly through small sellers who travel around the region.\n\n\u201cWe need direct investments, we need industries to create jobs in this country,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, director of the Chamber of Commerce in Lagos.\n\n\u201cSome people can celebrate but while they put their money to the bank, the rest of the people are suffering.\u201d", "description": "Lagos (AFP) \u2013 Two months ago, Nigeria slapped restrictions on cross-border
