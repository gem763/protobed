The Liberals, he said, were \u201cliterally just throwing ideas out the door.\u201d\n\nBut is it working? Polls are mixed. Some show the Conservatives pulling ahead since the images emerged of Trudeau and brownface and blackface. Others suggest the Liberals suffered a brief dip in support, but are now back in a statistical tie with the Conservatives. The vote is Oct. 21.\n\n\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears at an election campaign rally hosted by Liberal candidate Randeep Sarai this week in Surrey, British Columbia. (Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters)\n\n[Months before Canada\u2019s election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all]\n\nTrudeau, 47, has apologized repeatedly for the incidents \u2014 a blackface performance of \u201cThe Banana Boat Song (Day-O)\u201d when he was in high school, more blackface in a video from a costume day at the white water rafting operation where he worked in the early 1990s, and brownface at a party with an Arabian Nights theme in 2001. He has said he might have worn makeup on other occasions.\n\nThe images have threatened to tarnish Trudeau\u2019s global image as a champion of progressive values, tolerance and inclusion. Trudeau, the son of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, has said he was blinded by his privilege.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time,\u201d he told reporters in his first public comments after the first images emerged. \u201cBut now I recognize it was something racist to do.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday he called New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Canadian Sikh of Indian heritage, to apologize. The center-left New Democrats stand to gain support from progressive voters disenchanted with Trudeau.\n\n\n\nTrudeau greets climate change activist Greta Thunberg Friday before a climate strike march in Montreal. (Andrej Ivanov/Reuters)\n\nTrudeau and Singh have kept the contents of the call private. Singh, the first visible minority to lead a federal party in Canada, said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be used as a tool to exonerate\u201d Trudeau. He wants to see a broader discussion about racism in Canada.\n\n[In Canada\u2019s election, running against Trump is good politics]\n\nAlready, though, the controversy is fading from the debate. As Trudeau makes appearances and announcements across the country, reporters are asking more about the details of the policy proposals \u2014 often scant \u2014 than the racist images. What measures would a reelected Liberal government introduce to meet the 2050 targets? When would a national prescription drug plan be implemented? How much would it cost?\n\nThe specifics, the Liberal leader said, were TBD. Which has opened him to a different line of criticism.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned over the past couple of days is that Justin Trudeau is a master of improvisation,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cHe\u2019s proposing plans with no details. He\u2019s making up policy on the fly.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative leader is himself no stranger to criticism of proposals that lack specifics. But David Herle, a political consultant who has led Liberal election campaigns, said the announcements have been \u201ca little unusually light on detail.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that they were brought forward a little bit before they were ready,\u201d he said.\n\nThe controversy doesn\u2019t seem to have torpedoed Trudeau\u2019s reelection bid. David Coletto, chief executive of the Ottawa-based polling firm Abacus Data, said the scandal \u201cshocked the system,\u201d leading people to reevaluate how they think of the prime minister. But it hasn\u2019t knocked Trudeau out of the running, yet.\n\n\u201cHow close this race is means that any mistake that any party makes between the Conservatives and the Liberals could determine the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even if it costs them one or two points and that sustains itself, that could be the difference.\u201d\n\nThe danger for Trudeau, he said, is that the New Democrats and the Green Party siphon away \u201cfree agent\u201d voters who are unable to forgive Trudeau\u2019s transgressions, or that the energized Liberal voters who helped Trudeau win in 2015 choose to sit this one out.\n\n[\u2018This thing is a wildfire\u2019: Trudeau apologizes again as campaign reels from racist makeup revelations]\n\nIn addition to the policy proposals, Trudeau is doubling down on an old tactic: Tying Scheer and the Conservatives to Progressive Conservative Ontario Premier Doug Ford.\n\nFord, a populist who has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump, is deeply unpopular in the battleground province after lurching from scandal to scandal and imposing sweeping cuts to public services.\n\nFord extended the Ontario legislature\u2019s summer break until after the federal election, a move that appeared to be aimed at helping Scheer. Federal elections in Canada are often won or lost in the suburbs outside of Toronto.\n\n\u201cOn the campaign trail Doug Ford used to say he was for the people, but we all know too well what happened once he got into office,\u201d Trudeau told supporters in Thunder Bay on Wednesday. \u201cHe cut taxes for the rich and cut services for everybody else.\u201d\n\nScheer\u2019s Conservatives, he said, would do the same thing at the national level.\n\nFord and Trudeau are \u201ctwo of the most resonant political brands in Canada,\u201d said Lori Turnbull, a political scientist at Dalhousie University. She said that Trudeau is trying to exploit any \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d that people in Ontario have around Ford.\n\nAccording to a poll this week by the Angus Reid Institute, that buyer\u2019s remorse is real. Four in 10 respondents said Ford\u2019s performance in Ontario would deter them from voting for Scheer\u2019s Conservatives in the federal election.\n\n\u201cInstead of getting people focused on the brownface and blackface photos,\u201d Turnbull said, \u201cTrudeau is asking voters in Ontario to say, \u2018Yes, but if I don\u2019t vote for Trudeau as prime minister, Doug Ford is going to have a blank slate and do whatever he wants.\u2019 \u201d\n\nScheer embraced Ford after his election victory last year, but hasn\u2019t appeared with him \u2014 or any other conservative premier, for that matter \u2014 during the campaign.\n\n[Third incident of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in racist makeup emerges]\n\nThe makeup scandal catapulted Trudeau into international headlines for all the wrong reasons, making him a target for late-night talk show hosts and apparently shocking even Trump. The president, who last year tweeted that Trudeau was \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\u201d told reporters last week that he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the \u201cnumber of times\u201d he appeared in blackface.\n\nTrudeau told Global News this week that he had not worn brownface or blackface since 2001, when he darkened his skin and donned a feathered turban at the Arabian Nights-themed fundraising gala when he taught at a private school in British Columbia.\n\nIf Trudeau survives the scandal, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. He earned worldwide ridicule for a diplomatically awkward trip to India and was rebuked by Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog for a family vacation that broke conflict-of-interest laws. The resurfacing of an allegation that he groped a reporter at a music festival in 2000 also did little damage.\n\nThen came allegations this year that he inappropriately pressured his attorney general to cut an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based construction giant facing bribery and corruption charges, and then demoted her when she refused.\n\nThe scandal led to several high-profile resignations from his government and sparked questions about his commitment to the transparency and \u201csunny ways\u201d he promised. And weeks before the campaign kicked off, it earned him a second stinging rebuke from the ethics watchdog.\n\nRead more\n\nTrudeau launches Canada\u2019s election season dogged by scandal, Scheer\n\nCanada\u2019s Trudeau is down in the polls.
