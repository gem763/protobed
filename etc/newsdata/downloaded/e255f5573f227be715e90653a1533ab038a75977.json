(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nOne of the the major reasons why it\u2019s so easy to get excited about Warner Bros.\u2019 upcoming Birds of Prey, even though there\u2019s been little word on what the movie\u2019s actually about, is that somehow, against all odds, the studio seems to have finally grasped that the public is more than ready for a different kind of DCEU story.\n\nWhile the street-level Gotham flick\u2019s sure to have its fair share of bloody brawls in grimy alleys, everything about Birds of Prey\u2019s promotional material thus far\u2019s suggested that it\u2019ll also feature Harley and her madcap-ness in a way that\u2019ll keep things as lighthearted as they are terrifying \u2014 something none of WB\u2019s cape films have managed to pull off so far. The latest bit of Birds of Prey media, a poster, keeps that energy going with a striking image that tells any number of different stories depending on how you interpret what you\u2019re looking at.\n\nImage: Warner Bros.\n\nWhile Harley\u2019s flying around with the rest of Birds of Prey\u2019s characters, what\u2019s interesting is that she\u2019s also larger than life and set behind them, giving you the sense that everyone in the foreground in the image is just a little bird floating around her head as she\u2019s... who knows?\n\nRecovering from getting bonked in the head with her own hammer? Drugged out of her mind at Arkham? Or perhaps she\u2019s just minding her own business and telling herself a fun little story, about how she met a bunch of badasses who convinced her that giving up the villain life might be a good idea. Your guess is as good as anyone else\u2019s, but it makes for a great visual.\n\nBirds of Prey swoops into theatres February 8 in the U.S. with no current Australian release date set.", "description": "One of the the major reasons why it\u2019s so easy to get excited about Warner Bros.\u2019 upcoming Birds of Prey, even though there\u2019s been little word on what the movie\u2019s actually about, is that somehow, against all odds, the studio seems to have finally grasped that the public is more than ready for a different kind...", "authors": ["Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nfjk2ahh9ykp1jobbput.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
