Then they got to work.\n\nAs proponents of sustainable building, they wanted to design their home according to passive house standards that would radically reduce the building\u2019s energy consumption. And as practitioners of modern architecture, they wanted to make it lighter and brighter, and introduce simple, clean-lined details.\n\nFinding themselves with a bonanza of late 19th-century architectural details, however, they decided to split the difference and blend the new with the old. When demolition began in March 2017, Mr. Johnston and Ms. Mandl instructed their contractor, LB General Contracting, to gingerly pry out and preserve every significant piece of woodwork while stripping the interior down to the studs.\n\nThey erected a tent in the backyard to store the material they planned to reinstall and donated the rest to the architectural salvage store Big Reuse. Hoping to keep a few of the plaster elements, but unable to move them for construction, they left a decorative archway and an ornate ceiling medallion in place on the parlor level and crossed their fingers. The archway survived, but vibrations from the construction work eventually sent the medallion crashing to the floor.", "description": "For passive-house proponents, an ornate 1889 house in Bed-Stuy presented the ultimate challenge: How do you embrace the future without destroying the past?", "authors": ["Tim Mckeough"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/realestate/27LOCATION-BEDSTUY-slide-N1ZF/27LOCATION-BEDSTUY-slide-N1ZF-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"}
