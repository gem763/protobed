Based on the data extracted from the pedometer and phone accelerometer, users obtain great rewards that can be exchanged for goods and services from the fitness and sports industry, with specific discounts or even allowing users to make charitable donations with the rewards earned.\n\nFor this task, the company has Alexandre Rigaud who serves as the Chief Blockchain Officer and Co-Founder of StepChain. Alexandre has been a computer expert and coder since his early teens and speaks five languages fluently. With a Bachelor of Business Administration, International Business / Innovation and Entrepreneurship major, Alexandre is an expert in the Blockchain environment.

This company is led by experts with great knowledge in business administration, blockchain technology, marketing, and the cryptocurrency market, driving the company towards success. Every company or project needs to have a strong and experienced team behind, which will make it more possible for the company to eventually be successful; especially when competing with other well-established brands in the tech and fitness industries.\n\nIf you wish to know more about StepChain, please visit their website.", "description": "", "authors": ["This Is A Paid-For Advertisement.
