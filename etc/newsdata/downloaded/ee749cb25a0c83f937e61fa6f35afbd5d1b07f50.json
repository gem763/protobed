REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nDifficulties centred on trade and the status of the Irish border, although the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was quoted as saying he was optimistic about a deal.\n\n\u201cThere is a pathway to a possible deal but there are many issues that still need to be fully resolved,\u201d Varadkar said in a speech. \u201cI do think we are making progress but there are issues yet to be resolved and hopefully that can be done today.\n\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s not, there is still more time. October 31 is still a few weeks away and there is the possibility of an additional summit before that if we need one ... Although time is running short, I am confident that (Ireland\u2019s) objectives can be met.\u201d\n\nVaradkar said he had spoken to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier in the day. Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal.\n\nEuropean Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said after Barnier briefed the EU\u2019s executive arm: \u201cTalks have been constructive but there still remain a number of significant issues to resolve.\u201d\n\nAs the talks dragged on, a planned update for the 27 remaining EU states was delayed to 1500 GMT.\n\nEU sources said the talks had reached a \u201cstandstill\u201d over a future trade deal with Britain, and the rejection by Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of customs solutions tentatively agreed by negotiators.\n\n\u201cIt broke down because the DUP rejected the customs arrangement at their meeting with Johnson,\u201d an EU official told Reuters. \u201cSo there was a tentative customs deal but it got struck down.\n\n\u201cThe UK is negotiating with us again without being able to guarantee a majority in the House of Commons. We\u2019ve been here before.\u201d\n\nDUP VOTES\n\nJohnson is likely to have to rely on DUP votes to get any deal through the British parliament.\n\nAn EU diplomat said \u201cthe dynamics in London do not look as good today as they might have looked in recent days.\u201d\n\nJohnson and his team are in talks with the EU, and with lawmakers from the governing Conservative Party and the DUP to try to win their support for any deal, his spokesman said.\n\nThe spokesman said there remained issues to resolve with the EU. Johnson would update his senior ministers later in the day.\n\nA second EU diplomat said negotiators had disagreed over a future trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\n\u201cThe UK wants us to legally commit to sealing a free trade agreement with them in the future that would be tariff-free and quota-free. But we can\u2019t do that, it would be prejudging the future negotiations and tying our hands,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a bit of a standstill at the moment.\u201d\n\nHowever, Barnier, was quoted as telling a closed-door meeting of the European Commission earlier in the day that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about chances of getting a deal on Wednesday still.\n\nEarlier, reports of a possible collapse in negotiations to produce a Brexit deal that could be approved by a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday hit sterling and stocks in London.\n\n\u201cAll of these things hang together so pulling one element out may collapse the whole structure,\u201d said another official in Brussels. \u201cSome of these issues are pretty significant.\u201d\n\nBarring a last-minute agreement at the summit, the EU believes Britain will have to delay its departure for a third time. Extension options range from an additional month beyond Oct. 31 to half a year or more.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe EU may hold an emergency summit later in October to either approve a deal, grant an extension or make final preparations for a chaotic split.\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit minister Steve Barclay said he would not accept a Brexit delay beyond Oct. 31, even if it was only used to tie up the necessary legal requirements of an agreement.\n\n\u201cNo, I think it is important that we leave on the 31st of October,\u201d Barclay told a British parliamentary committee.", "description": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday that last-ditch talks between the European Union and Britain had so far failed to resolve issues standing in the way of an amicable Brexit, with EU sources reporting a \"standstill\".", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441479441&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F13L", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
