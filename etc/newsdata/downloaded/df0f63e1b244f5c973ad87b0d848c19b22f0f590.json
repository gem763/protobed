How hollow sounded Corbyn's previous oft-repeated declarations that he would love to take up the gauntlet and contest an election \u2013 if only the Prime Minister took a No Deal Brexit off the table.\n\nTrue, that strategy had some credibility a few weeks ago.\n\nBut not now that a No Deal Brexit has died in the ditch as a result of the law introduced by Labour MP Hilary Benn and passed merrily by the Remain- dominated Commons, forcing the Government to seek a three-month extension to our membership of the EU if MPs didn't approve Johnson's exit deal.\n\nThe Labour-inspired block on a No Deal Brexit may have been a fail-safe insurance policy but very few people actually believed that Johnson \u2013 for all his purple 'do or die' rhetoric \u2013 really intended to risk chaos by pulling the UK out on October 31 without a deal. Only a caucus of Tory Brexit diehards hoped Johnson would hurl the country \u2013 lemming-like \u2013 off the cliff.\n\nPictured: Jeremy Corbyn on This Morning on Friday, seen with Luis and Christina Walker\n\nI believe that Johnson was always determined to secure an agreement with Brussels \u2013 even though some in his own Cabinet were surprised by his emollience.\n\nBut with Brexit now firmly squared with the remaining 27 EU countries, the problem lies in Westminster.\n\nCentral to this is the shamelessly hypocritical Labour Party which has howled for months for a general election but which now refuses to countenance one because its opinion poll ratings are so poor.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is the first Opposition leader in history to block a general election.\n\nDespite calling for one at least 50 times this year, Corbyn changed tack in September when he feared he might lose.\n\nAnd without Labour agreeing an election, there is little chance Johnson will get one because under the absurd Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, 434 MPs must vote for an election to be triggered.\n\nPictured: Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks to schoolchildren during his visit to Middleton Primary School in Milton Keynes\n\nBut there are only 288 Tory MPs \u2013 meaning that even with the support of Lib Dems and Scottish Nationalists, Johnson is likely to fall about 80 votes short in his bid on Monday to have a national poll on December 12. Despite holding this zombie Parliament hostage, Corbyn's control of his own party is getting weaker by the day.\n\nYesterday, there were reports that he had been 'taken prisoner' by his chief whip to stop him unwittingly blundering into giving ground to Boris Johnson.\n\nThis came after some Corbyn's allies said their boss would secretly be content to let Johnson 'get Brexit done' and fight an election in the spring. The reasoning for this is that with Brexit out of the way, Labour might take electoral advantage from the Lib Dems being deemed an irrelevance because their flagship 'No Brexit' policy would have been wrecked.\n\nIncreasingly, Corbyn is, in the words of one Labour MP with whom I spoke yesterday, the party's 'LINO' \u2013 Leader In Name Only.\n\nHe has become the puppet of Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who, aided by Sir Keir Starmer and Diane Abbott, want to stop Brexit \u2013 and only then fight an election.\n\nTo add to the disarray, most Labour MPs are terrified of a December 12 election because they are convinced the Tories will win \u2013 not least by exploiting Corbyn's serial failings.\n\nAll this said, Corbyn's army of fanatical young supporters in his hard-Left Momentum movement power base still think he walks on water. They believe that just as he came from a long way behind and nearly beat Theresa May in the 2017 election, he can do the same to Boris Johnson.\n\nFor his part, despite his infectious optimism, Johnson is trapped. He can't yet deliver Brexit and he can't call a general election.\n\nHe has little choice but to try to persuade everyone \u2013 regardless of how they voted in the EU referendum \u2013that it is in Britain's best interests to 'get Brexit done' and to shame Labour into agreeing to an election.\n\nIn the meantime, officials in Downing Street and Brussels have already started preparing for the depressing possibility that Britain will miss a fourth deadline \u2013 probably January 31 \u2013 for leaving the EU. If this happened, we could still be in the EU next April, nearly four years after the referendum.\n\nBy then, Remainer MPs would say the case for a second referendum \u2013 their best hope of wrecking Brexit \u2013would be unanswerable.\n\nIs that really in Britain's best interests?", "description": "SIMON WALTERS: Despite touting himself around the TV chat-show sofa circuit yesterday and claiming that he 'loves campaigning', Jeremy Corbyn is still desperate to avoid a general election.", "authors": ["Simon Walters For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/01/20203730-0-image-a-30_1572050218343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
