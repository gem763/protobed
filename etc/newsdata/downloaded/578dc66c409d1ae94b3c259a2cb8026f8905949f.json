It\u2019s transparently, even famously, false. Either the media was going to make him pay by calling him on it or a Democratic rival would.\n\nBut no, apart from a few righties like me crying foul, he got away with it scot-free. How? Right, I know, normally you\u2019d expect the press to let him slide, but don\u2019t forget that many journalists are pulling for a more progressive candidate in the primaries. They have an ideological incentive at the moment to fact-check Biden rigorously. As do his opponents, of course.\n\nHe got so little flak for what he said on Colbert, though, that he repeated the claim last night before a national audience. In an exchange with open-borders shill Jorge Ramos, no less.\n\nThis time the press wouldn\u2019t let him slide. Vox immigration reporter Dara Lind was so disgusted by his lie that she tuned out:\n\nI care to learn exactly nothing else about this debate. That is a bald-faced lie. The pics of kids in cages that went viral in 2018 were from 2014; record numbers of deportations; etc etc etc. Good night. \u2014 Dara Lind (@DLind) September 13, 2019\n\nYou want fact-checks? You got fact-checks. The AP dinged Biden this morning, as did PolitiFact, as did the Times and Vox. Fox News had commentators on as well to call Biden out. Grandpa Joe is right that the Obama administration didn\u2019t separate families like Trump has but he\u2019s simply incorrect that Trump brought \u201ccages\u201d to immigration policy. Team O introduced those for unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border five years ago.\n\nI mean, really:\n\nAll of that being so, I continue not to understand how the rest of the field didn\u2019t pounce on Biden for this. If ever Julian Castro was going to accuse Joe of having a brain turned to oatmeal by age, you would think it would have been here: \u201cHave you really forgotten your own administration\u2019s habit of caging migrant children, Mr. Vice President? Or has that memory been lost too, like the memory of your early support for the Iraq war?\u201d That would have been a twofer, introducing concerns about Biden\u2019s age into the mix while highlighting his terrible ideological sin of supporting basic enforcement.\n\nSpeaking of which, go watch the clip above again and drink in the spectacle of a Democratic VP being put on the spot by an immigration radical masquerading as a journalist for having done nothing more than enforce the immigration laws of the United States. Biden had an easy comeback to Ramos if he wanted it: \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job to faithfully execute federal statutes. We lobbied Congress for comprehensive immigration reform; we did what we could to spare the most sympathetic cases, like DREAMers, from removal. But at the end of the day we had a job to do and we did it.\u201d But he was afraid to give that answer, preferring to let himself be shamed instead for not being willfully derelict in his duty.
