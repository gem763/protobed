Boris Johnson still faces plenty of hurdles in securing an agreement with the EU because the UK Parliament has rejected his deal. Adding to the PM\u2019s troubles, Speaker Bercow denied a second debate on the topic on Monday.\n\nTrump and Kudlow Lay Deal Breadcrumbs (Again) for Dow Bulls\n\nThe positive boost to stock markets in the US from trade war developments was noticeable at the open of trade. Trump saying that he hoped to sign a trade deal at the APEC summit in Chile mixed with Larry Kudlow\u2019s hints that the tariffs planned for December could also be removed to create an optimistic cocktail for investors.\n\nDow bulls will take Kudlow\u2019s comments particularly seriously, given that the last time he teased progress, it came to fruition. Before these developments, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is in charge of Beijing\u2019s trade team, suggested that substantial progress had been made, setting the foundation for the White House\u2019s positivity.\n\nNevertheless, escalating tensions in Hong Kong remain an ongoing threat to the trade deal, as well as the Dow Jones.\n\nAdding to background risks for markets, the ceasefire in Northern Syria looks to have been a failure after Trump capitulated on the issue amid bipartisan backlash. The need to appease Republicans has been all too apparent as the impeachment process rumbles on, and another concession by the president not to hold a G7 summit at his hotel in Doral was made after angering lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nGlobal Growth Concerns Remain Primary Risk Factor for Stocks\n\nFocusing more on the current economic health of the United States, recent data releases have been alarming in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. While the stock market has been mainly resilient thanks to a sturdy US consumer, risks are rising.\n\nNordea economists Martin Enlund, Joachim Bernhardsen, and Andreas Steno Larsen believe that growth will continue to dip heading into next year, as Trump\u2019s trade war continues to damage the global risk environment.\n\nThey write:\n\n\u201cWhile some economists have highlighted the GM strike as possible driver of the divergence between regional surveys and the important ISM manufacturing gauge, we think the China/US conflict is much more important. The divergence unfolded as the ISM exports orders component crashed fairly soon after the breakdown in China/US talks this spring (this makes sense because of less sensitivity to China in the the regions covered by the Philly & NY Fed surveys). In short, we expect economic uncertainty to remain high, especially as US and global growth will likely slow further going into next year.\u201d\n\nDow Stocks: Boeing Tanks, Apple Zooms to Record High\n\nBoeing stock had another miserable day on Monday, piling a 4.1% pullback on Friday\u2019s sell-off. The damage to the Dow 30 continues to come from instant messages that appeared to show that Boeing misled the FAA on a safety issue with the infamous 737 MAX airplane, prompting an aggressive rebuke from activist Ralph Nader.\n\nThe bright mood in the broader stock market lifted Treasury yields, sending JPMorgan Chase to fresh record highs above $123, while Goldman Sachs rose 1.3% amid the squeeze out of bonds.\n\nApple stock continues to be buoyant, and shares are trading at fresh record highs above $240. Analysts can\u2019t get enough of AAPL, and they continue to raise their forecasts relentlessly. In fundamental news, the iPhone XR is now being assembled in India for domestic sales, bolstering Apple\u2019s efforts to avoid de-globalization risks and ensure access to one of the world\u2019s most rapidly growing economies.\n\nOil companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron both rose around 1.5%, despite some continued weakness in the price of crude.\n\nClick here for a live Dow Jones Industrial Average chart.", "description": "The Dow Jones avoided crashing with Boeing stock on Monday as Donald Trump and Larry Kudlow dropped hints about an impending trade deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/donald-trump-trade-timeline-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
