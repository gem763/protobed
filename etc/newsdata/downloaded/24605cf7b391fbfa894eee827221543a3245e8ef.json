DRAIN THE SWAMP!\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, in a tweet, Sept. 30, 2019\n\nThis all-caps tweet is emblematic of the anger expressed by President Trump as the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry goes forward, on the basis of a whistleblower complaint about his efforts to persuade the Ukrainian government to investigate a potential 2020 rival, former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nIt also is emblematic of how inaccurate news flows into the president\u2019s Twitter account. A speculative article on a conservative website provided fodder for talking points by presidential allies on television, which in turn caught the attention of the president. Then the president stretched the claim even further into a Four-Pinocchio statement.\n\nLet\u2019s explore.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThis all started with tweets by Stephen McIntyre, a mining consultant who runs Climate Audit, a blog skeptical of climate change data. \u201cHere is something seriously strange,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe Disclosure of Urgent Concern Form located earlier today at DNI is only two days old according to its pdf properties.\u201d Moreover, he noted, the form had been revised in August \u2014 which just happens to be the month when the whistleblower submitted allegations about Trump.\n\nAn intelligence officer, as a whistleblower, can file an \u201curgent concern\u201d report of potential wrongdoing to trigger statutory procedures that require expedited reporting of misconduct to congressional intelligence committees. In his letter outlining the complaint, the whistleblower cited 50 U.S.C. Section 3033(k) (5)(A), which sets out the process that allows someone in the intelligence community to trigger an \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nThe \u201curgent concern\u201d form apparently had not been online until recently. But the Federalist, an online publication, obtained an earlier form, from May 2018, which had a section titled: \u201cFIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.\u201d\n\nThis section of the form ended: \u201cIf you think that wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions, [the intelligence community inspector general] will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA,\u201d referring to the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998. This warning language is not in the new online form.\n\nThe Federalist article asserted that \u201cbetween May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.\u201d (The Federalist refuses to disclose its funding, but its articles often defend Trump against reports in what it calls the \u201ccorporate media.\u201d)\n\nTrump seized on this claim and tweeted that this meant that long-standing whistleblower rules were changed just in recent weeks.\n\nBut forms don\u2019t change rules; the rules are set by laws and policies. In this case, the guiding document is Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 120, which was issued in 2014 and last updated in 2016. The directive implements Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 19, \u201cProtecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information,\u201d signed by President Barack Obama to provide the first executive-branch protections for intelligence community whistleblowers.\n\nPPD 19 was issued in response to WikiLeaks\u2019 release of classified State Department cables. The urgency to issue ICD 120, the implementing instructions, was in response to the massive leak of national security information by Edward Snowden, who went to media on the belief he was not protected by whistleblower laws.\n\nICD 120 sets a \u201creasonable belief\u201d standard for reporting wrongdoing through protected disclosures \u2014 \u201cthat the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d\n\nA \u201creasonable belief\u201d covers information obtained secondhand, according to Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst at the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, and other experts consulted by The Fact Checker. \u201cAs a whistleblower, you can always submit a complaint if you have a reasonable belief, even if it is secondhand or even third-hand,\u201d McCullough said.\n\n(Note: McCullough\u2019s father is Charles McCullough, the inspector general for the Intelligence community from 2010 to 2017, when ICD 120 was issued, and now an attorney for the unnamed whistleblower. He said he and his father \u201cbuilt a firewall between us on this case, in part because his representation of the whistleblower wandered into my policy expertise.\u201d)\n\nNotwithstanding the section on firsthand information highlighted by the Federalist, the May 2018 form includes a box that can be checked about the sources of information: a) \u201cI have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved,\u201d b) \u201cOther employees have told me about events or records involved\u201d or c) \u201cOther source(s) (please explain).\u201d\n\nThe new form has virtually the same options: a) \u201cI have direct and personal knowledge\u201d and b) \u201cI heard about it from others.\u201d\n\nThe filing of the form is only the first part of the process. The inspector general has 14 days to determine how credible a claim is before deciding whether to proceed, including by interviewing witnesses and obtaining documents.\n\nIn the case of the Ukraine whistleblower, he wrote that he \u201cwas not a direct witness to most of the events\u201d recounted in the complaint. But Michael Atkinson, the current inspector general for intelligence, said that even without access to the memo of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Atkinson\u2019s preliminary review found that the complaint \u201cappears credible,\u201d including that Trump sought to pressure the Ukrainian president to help with his reelection bid.\n\nOn its face, it makes little sense for an IG to refuse secondhand information at the initial stage, since an IG, like a prosecutor or a journalist, is looking for leads, not merely for admissible evidence. Both versions of the form allowed for the submission of secondhand information, as provided in the guiding policy documents. The older form merely had a stronger warning that the tip would need to be verified by the IG before it could be deemed credible, perhaps to discourage complaints from people soon to be terminated or disciplined.\n\nIn a lengthy statement rebutting the Federalist\u2019s reporting, the IG\u2019s office said that the Ukraine whistleblower relied on the 2018 form, not the new online form:\n\nAlthough the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute. In fact, by law the Complainant \u2013 or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees \u2013 need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern. The ICIG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law.\n\nThe statement also provided this detail:\n\nThe Complainant on the form he or she submitted on August 12, 2019 in fact checked two relevant boxes: The first box stated that, \u201cI have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved\u201d; and the second box stated that, \u201cOther employees have told me about events or records involved.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe original report in the Federalist focused on a change in the form, suggesting it was somehow related to the recent whistleblower case. There is no evidence that is correct.\n\nIn any case, the IG\u2019s process for handling whistleblower allegations is determined not by a form but by the law and related policy documents. The key document, ICD 120, has been virtually unchanged since 2014. Contrary to the speculation, the whistleblower used the 2018 form, not the new online form. The IG then investigated and found that his allegations were credible and that Congress should be notified.\n\nThe president seized on reports on the form to falsely claim the rules for whistleblowers were changed just before the whistleblower\u2019s report was submitted in August. That\u2019s false and worthy of Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "The president jumped on a report about the change in an online form, but the rules are set by laws and procedures put in place years ago.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BYmPhnyLicnghVJbbO8TWuSVtec=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FX4C6XHDXMI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
