Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nBut Sondland added that he did not realize \u201cuntil much later\u201d that Giuliani was seeking a Ukrainian-led investigation into Biden and his son. And he said any effort to solicit foreign assistance in an American election \u201cwould be wrong.\u201d\n\nHe also said military assistance to Ukraine \u201cshould not have been delayed for any reason,\u201d but added that Trump repeatedly told him there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d involving the aid and an investigation of Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony has the potential to be the most devastating yet for Trump\u2019s defenders, who say he did not apply inappropriate pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a 2020 rival. It was Sondland\u2019s text messages denying the existence of a quid pro quo, obtained by Congress earlier this month, that Trump pointed to as proof he did nothing untoward.\n\nThe House\u2019s impeachment inquiry has centered on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump asked his counterpart for a \u201cfavor.\u201d Democrats have pointed to the request as evidence that Trump abused the power of his office.\n\nThe inquiry also focuses on the decision to freeze critical military assistance to Ukraine. House impeachment investigators are looking into whether Trump sought to use the withheld aid as leverage over Zelensky as the president sought probes into his political enemies.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorneys in a letter to House investigators say he has ample documentation to back up his testimony but that the White House and State Department are blocking him from sharing it, claiming it could implicate executive privilege and other confidentiality restrictions.\n\n\u201c[Sondland] strongly believes that disclosure will lead to a more fulsome and accurate inquiry into the matters at issue and will corroborate the testimony that he will give in key respects,\u201d Sondland\u2019s attorneys wrote in a Thursday letter. \u201cHowever, the choice is not his to make, and so we must regretfully decline to produce the documents that the committees have requested from Ambassador Sondland.\u201d\n\nSondland now says he only claimed there was no quid pro quo because Trump repeatedly assured him of it in a direct phone call \u2014 regardless of whether it was true.\n\n\u201cAnd I recall the president was in a bad mood,\u201d Sondland intends to say.\n\nSondland will also offer a strong defense of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted by Trump after a campaign by the president\u2019s allies to recall her to Washington. Trump himself blasted Yovanovitch during his July 25 call Zelensky, and Yovanovitch testified to lawmakers last week that her removal was based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d", "description": "Trump\u2019s EU ambassador plans to tell House investigators he opposed the president\u2019s request to run Ukraine policy through Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1166060392-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
