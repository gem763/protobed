The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Marie Fishpaw, director of domestic policy studies, offered the following response:\n\n\n\n\u201cWith health care still a top concern for most Americans, it\u2019s time for Congress to implement policies that actually provide more Americans with access to lower-cost, higher-quality health care\u2014not build on the shortcomings and failures of the Affordable Care Act, as this bill would.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s legislation also represents another step toward government-run health care because it would let bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., stifle flexibility and innovation by deciding what gets covered by insurance plans.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInstead of doubling down on Obamacare\u2019s failures, Congress should expand the Trump administration\u2019s successful regulatory relief agenda so that Americans could find more and better options at lower prices, while still protecting those with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cData from the Heritage Foundation shows that when states have been given even a tiny amount of freedom from Obamacare\u2019s mandates, they\u2019ve been able to lower insurance premium costs and ensure that the most vulnerable and sick retain access to care. This bill would reverse that momentum, and limit Americans\u2019 ability to get the coverage and care they need.\u201d", "description": "Democrat\u00a0lawmakers today unveiled a bill that would broadly expand Obamacare\u2019s regulations while reversing several Trump administration policies that have helped improve coverage choices and lower costs for Americans.
