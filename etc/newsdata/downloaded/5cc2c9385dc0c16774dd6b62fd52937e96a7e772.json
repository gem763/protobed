As the storm went on, she saw connections bloom across social media to rescue and reunite families.\n\n\"There's no number that everyone knows for disasters of this magnitude and there was no social media plan whatsoever,\" deGregory said. \"So everything that happened purely happened because someone would connect it to someone who was connected to someone who's connected to someone else.\"\n\nAn aerial view shows devastation after hurricane Dorian hit the Grand Bahama Island in the Bahamas,September 4, 2019.

She told Insider that \"the government failed\" Bahamians, who saved countless lives because of their quick organizing.\n\n\"Our government has failed us,\" Mullings said. \"If we hadn't stepped up, we don't know where we would be.\"\n\nOn Friday, Mullings said she was acting as a point of contact for families who needed to be rescued and the private planes and boats of those willing to head to the most battered islands, where at least 30 had been counted as dead as of the end of the week.\n\n\"We couldn't wait for the government,\" Mullings said. \"If we had waited on the government, we'd have way more, you know, hundreds of hundreds of more dead bodies.\"\n\nFor Insider's live reporting about the latest progress of the hurricane, click here \u00bb\n\nThe Bahamas Health Minister, Duane Sands, said Friday that the agency is aware of uncollected bodies and that he expected the death toll to rise significantly. He also announced that there would be a new process for updating the death toll, which compares numbers from health teams and the Royal Bahamas Police, in an attempt to avoid getting any \"mixed information.\"\n\n\"I want to be very clear,\" he told reporters in a press conference, according to CNN. \"Certainly, The Ministry of Health and the Government of the Bahamas has no interest in suppressing information. What we want to do is ensure the information that is given is accurate.\"\n\nThe storm's recovery is far from over, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement early Saturday that, at the request of the Bahamian government, the US Agency for International Development has sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team to support and coordinate the country's official relief efforts.\n\nRead more:\n\nCruise ships from Norwegian and Royal Caribbean are bringing supplies to the Bahamas to help victims of Hurricane Dorian\n\nHurricane Dorian made landfall in North Carolina Friday morning.
