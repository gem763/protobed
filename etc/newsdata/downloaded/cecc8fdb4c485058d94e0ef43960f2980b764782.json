It's the foundation of the company and sets the purpose of the business.\n\nThat mission statement \"aligns everyone to the organization,\" Scott said in a recent webinar moderated by Business Insider.\n\nThe \"elevator pitch,\" or the ability to sell your company's main goal in one sentence, is key to hooking investors and establishing solid ground in the presentation. That's so everyone has a clear understanding of what the company's mission is at the outset of the pitch, Scott said.\n\nHeadset was initially hoping to raise $6 million in its Series A funding round, Scott previously told Business Insider. The startup ended up raising just over $12 million at a $43 million post-money valuation in January, as venture-capital firms have increasingly targeted the cannabis-tech space.\n\nRead more: We got an exclusive look at the pitch deck buzzy marijuana tech startup Headset used to raise $12 million and ink deals with Nielsen and Deloitte\n\nVCs are betting on cannabis startups\n\nAs of July of this year, VCs have poured $1.6 billion into cannabis startups, up from $1.2 billion in all of 2018, according to a recent report from the data provider PitchBook.\n\nMost VC funds still draw a hard line between cannabis-tech companies, like Headset, and branded products that \"touch the plant\" or sell and distribute THC. That's because THC is illegal under US federal law.\n\nHeadset CEO Cy Scott. Headset\n\nScott said that Headset's mission is simple: enable success for the cannabis industry by driving informed decisions through data. The company collects retail-sales data and provides market intelligence to dispensaries across the country.\n\n\"With the mission statement, you're taking out the guesswork, and you're able to articulate the whole mission,\" Scott said. \"We reemphasize here that the solution is data and Headset is the solution.\"\n\nWhy Poseidon Asset Management was drawn to Headset\n\nThe clarity of the mission statement is what immediately caught the attention of Emily Paxhia, a founding partner of Poseidon Asset Management, a cannabis-specific investment fund, she said.\n\nPoseidon led Headset's recent Series A fundraising round earlier this year.\n\n\"It demonstrates real discipline by a founder to have a clear mission statement,\" Paxhia said in the webinar.\n\nShe added that she's been in many pitch meetings where a startup has turned its mission statement into a 10-minute overblown spiel. If that's the case, Paxhia said the company has more work to do. She said it's important to \"distill the most important points that would really resonate with investors\" before putting together the pitch deck.\n\nFor Scott, the mission statement also acts as the through line for the company as it continues to grow. Since the Series A round, Headset's team has doubled in size, he said.\n\n\"The mission statement is fundamental means to align everybody to remember why we're here,\" Scott said. \"We're here to make sure this cannabis industry is successful by making sure that the businesses in the industry are successful.\"", "description": "Cy Scott, the CEO of Headset, shared his key advice for creating the right pitch deck to hook investors.", "authors": ["Clarrie Feinstein", "Jeremy Berke"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d727f7a2e22af0c4d60eef5-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
