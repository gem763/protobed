The parties are raging. The streets are buzzing.\n\nIt\u2019s the wee hours of the morning Monday in Houston, and no one wants to go home.\n\nEveryone wants to celebrate the man of the hour, who saved the Houston Astros\u2019 game with his glove, won it with his bat, and then displayed one of the most fabulous walk-off celebrations ever seen in baseball.\n\nCarlos Correa sent New York Yankees pitcher J.A. Happ\u2019s fastball deep into the night over the right-field wall. The ball had not even landed when Correa took a step with his right foot. Then his left. Then, his right. Dropped the bat. Stared at his teammates. Put his right hand towards his head. Cupped his ear. Took four more steps. And started hopping.\n\nWhen he reached first base, he finally began his trot round the bases, raising his right arm and his index finger pointed towards the screaming crowd. He came around third base, started towards home, stopped about 30 feet short, took off his helmet, jumped, and shot his helmet into the air as if he were Steph Curry.\n\nPARAMEDIC HIT: Foul ball drills paramedic in the Astros dugout\n\nEPIC CELEBRATION: Correa has great reaction to his walk-off home run\n\nCarlos Correa celebrates after smacking a walk-off home run to lift the Houston Astros to a 3-2 victory in Game 2 of the ALCS vs. the New York Yankees.

The adrenaline started pumping like crazy. I don\u2019t even know what I did. I\u2019ve got to go watch the video.\n\n\u201cBut I know I was hyped.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe ALCS now is tied at 1-game apiece with the series headed to Yankee Stadium, but considering the Astros have the hottest pitcher on the planet, Gerrit Cole in Game 3, Justin Verlander back in Game 6, and Cole again, it almost felt as if this were Game 7.\n\nThe Astros knew they had to win this game, or the series would be over, knowing that only three teams in LCS history have ever recovered from a 2-0 deficit.\n\n\u201cThere was no 0-2,\u2019\u2019 Bregman said. \u201cIt was never going to be 0-2. We were going to win tonight.\u2019\u2019\n\nSaid Astros catcher Robinson Chirinos: \u201cWe had no choice. We had to win this game.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was the confidence the entire team showed Sunday knowing that Verlander was on the mound, and sparked by Correa, who predicted to anyone who\u2019d listen that he was going to do something great before the evening was over.\n\nAt 11:58 p.m. Central Time, he worked his magic.\n\n\u201cHe told me before the game,\u2019\u2019 Astros second baseman Jose Altuve said, \u201cand he was like, \u201cJosey, I think I\u2019m going to do something big tonight.\u2019 He really did.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, to be honest, Altuve figured that moment arrived in the sixth inning, when he saved the game, and Altuve\u2019s glove, with a play that brought back memories of Derek Jeter 18 years ago in Oakland.\n\nYankees outfielder Brett Gardner, with runners on first and second, hit a sharp one-hopper to Altuve. It clanked of his glove, and caromed to his right. Yankees third baseman coach Phil Nevin alertly waved D.J. LeMahieu home, only to see Correa run over, and grab the ball. He fired an 87-mph fastball home to Chirinos, and LeMahieu was out by 10 feet.\n\n\u201cWhen I opened my eyes,\u2019\u2019 Altuve said, \u201cI saw we made an out at home plate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I was really happy.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt had Verlander dancing from the mound, pumping his fist, and 43,359 screaming fans believing they just witnessed the re-enactment of Jeter\u2019s flip to home plate to nail Jeremy Giambi at the plate.\n\n\u201cAs an infielder, I know how tough it is to catch a ball that\u2019s a line drive right at you, in between [the legs]\u2019\u2019 Correa said. \u201cSo, as soon as I knew that it was going to crash in between, I was creeping over. When it hit him, and I saw the ball go my way, I just went after it. And I grabbed it.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked up and I saw he was sending the runner, I thought, \u2018Oh, I got this guy.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo I threw him out. I don\u2019t know why he sent him, but, thank you.\u201d\n\nSays Verlander: \"It was just incredible.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was quite a welcome to the postseason for Correa, who played in only 75 games this season with a cracked rib and back injury, missing the final week of the season, and going just 3-for-22 in the Astros\u2019 first six postseason gmaes, dropping to seventh in the lineup.\n\nHe was hitless in Game 1, but came out Sunday with a run-scoring double in the second inning, a strike out in the fourth, hitting a fly ball to the deepest part of center field in the sixth, and then striking out again in the ninth. But then came his heroics in the 11th.\n\n\u201cI was very confident going into the game,\u2019\u2019 Correa said, \u201cthat today was the day where I was going to break out. And going into that last inning I thought, I got this. \u2026Everybody was telling me, \u201cYou\u2019re going to hit it. You\u2019re going to hit a home run.\u2019\u2019\n\nOh, he got it all right. Opposite field. Over the right-field wall. Home run.\n\n\u201cI know what kind of player I am when I\u2019m healthy,\u201d Correa said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a roller-coaster of a year with the injuries and stuff.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all worth it for moments like this, moments like where you give your team a chance to win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all worth it, man.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "description": "Carlos Correa hit the game-winning home run in Game 2 of the ALCS, lifting the Astros over the Yankees to even the series.
