If he can win there, he's probably unbeatable \u2014 but that's a big if.", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to 2020 Vision, the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one key takeaway every weekday and a wrap-up each weekend. Reminder: There are 116 days until the Iowa caucuses and 390 days until the 2020 election.\n\nOn Thursday evening, President Trump will arrive at Minneapolis\u2019s Target Center for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation. Which raises the question: Why Minnesota?\n\nBecause Trump thinks he can win there in 2020.\n\n\u201c[That\u2019s a] state that I\u2019m going to win \u2014 Minnesota,\u201d Trump told Turning Point USA in July. \u201cI almost won it last time. We came [within] just about a point. Minnesota is very hard work for a Republican to win. We almost won it \u2014 one more night. I wanted to go there one more time. I said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, we\u2019re going to win Minnesota.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf Trump were to win Minnesota\u2019s 10 electoral votes, it\u2019s almost impossible to see how a Democrat could defeat him next November. And he\u2019s right: Even though the state is \u201cvery hard work\u201d for a Republican \u2014 no GOP presidential candidate has carried it since 1972, and no Republican, period, has won a statewide race in 13 years \u2014 Trump did, in fact, almost upset Hillary Clinton there in 2016, falling short by just 45,000 votes, or 1.5 percentage points.\n\nSo does Trump have a shot? Yes \u2014 but only if everything breaks his way.\n\nPresident Trump arrives at a campaign rally on Oct. 4, 2018, in Rochester, Minn.

Now Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale plans to unload \u201ctens of millions of dollars,\u201d according to the New York Times. Already, the campaign has 20 paid staff members on the ground, and it expects to add another 80; along with the Republican National Committee, it\u2019s currently outspending Democrats by about 4 to 1 on digital advertising.\n\n\u201cOver the last 25 years, I\u2019ve never seen an investment as robust and deep this early by a Republican presidential candidate,\u201d the chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party told the Times. \u201cTrump and the Republicans believe they can win and are doing everything to make it so.\u201d\n\nBut believing you can win \u2014 and spending heavily to do so \u2014 is only half the battle. The problem for Trump is that Minnesota is likely to be more of an uphill fight in 2020, not less. At the start of his presidency, 46 percent of Minnesotans approved of Trump; 43 percent disapproved. But over the last 22 months, his approval rating in Minnesota has plummeted by 14 percentage points; he\u2019s now underwater by 11 points in the state.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections reflected this decline. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith won their races by 24 and 9 points, respectively, and Gov. Tim Walz defeated his Republican opponent by 12 points. Democrats also flipped 18 seats to win control of the state House of Representatives.\n\nFrom left: Minnesota Democrats Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen.

In Minnesota\u2019s Seventh Congressional District \u2014 an area Trump swept by 31.5 percentage points in 2016 \u2014 Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson eked out a slim 4-point victory after clobbering his Republican opponent by 26 points in 2012. Republicans also flipped two U.S. House seats in the rural First and Eighth Districts. The victories were further evidence, they say, that rural Minnesota is trending in Trump\u2019s direction. (In 2016, for instance, he won the Eighth District by 16 points, four years after Barack Obama won it by 6 points.)", "description": "If Trump were to win Minnesota\u2019s 10 electoral votes, it\u2019s almost impossible to see how a Democrat could defeat him next November.
