Krona Sinks After Swedish Jobless Data Deemed a `Catastrophe'\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Sweden\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly spiked to a four-year high in August, raising questions around the central bank\u2019s plans to hike interest rates and driving the krona lower.\n\nThe seasonally-adjusted jobless rate jumped to 7.4%, much worse than the 6.8% reading in a Bloomberg survey of economist estimates. The news, which resulted in a 0.8% decline in the krona against the euro, was quickly dubbed \u201ca catastrophe\u201d by Martin Enlund, a currency strategist at Nordea Bank Abp in Stockholm.\n\nAt Svenska Handelsbanken AB, Head of Trading Strategy Claes Mahlen said the data \u201cadds to our view that Riksbank will ultimately call off planned rate rises.\u201d\n\nThe latest jobless report is bad news for Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson, who is due to present the 2020 budget on Wednesday. It will also make it harder for the Riksbank to commit to its plan to raise interest rates again around the turn of the year.\n\nMost economists expect Riksbank policy makers to adjust their forward guidance to take the global monetary environment and weaker economic conditions into account. According to GDP data published last week, Sweden\u2019s trade-dependent economy all but stalled in the first half of the year.\n\nIn its analysis of the unemployment report, SEB AB said it seems that \u201cthere is more weakness behind these numbers than just uncertain summer months. The Riksbank will have to adjust its forecast upwards.\u201d", "description": "Krona Sinks After Swedish Jobless Data Deemed a `Catastrophe'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED350WV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
