He had campaigned on a 100% import tax he imposed on Serbian products last year in retaliation for Serbia\u2019s lobbying against Kosovo joining international organizations.\n\nThe leftist Self-Determination Movement led by Albin Kurti, and the center-right Democratic League of Kosovo, led former premier, Isa Mustafa, took 26% and 25% of the vote respectively, according to almost complete results. Shortly after the results were out, Kurti said early Monday that the two parties may form a coalition government, local media reported.\n\nParliament Speaker Kadri Veseli\u2019s party was headed for third place with 21% and a Haradinaj-led coalition was at 12%.\n\nThe two opposition parties that won most votes have been critical of Haradinaj\u2019s policies. Even so, all major groups in predominantly ethnic Albanian-populated Kosovo demand unconditional recognition of independence from Serbia and reject concessions such as a land swap floated last year by the presidents of Serbia and Kosovo.\n\nEU-mediated talks to normalize relations stalled in 2018. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said late Sunday that his country was ready to resume the negotiations with whomever forms a new government in Kosovo, on condition that the trade barrier is lifted.\n\nKosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008 and is seeking full international recognition as an independent state and a lasting peace deal with its neighbor as both Balkan nations seek to advance toward EU membership.\n\nSerbia vows never to recognize Kosovo as a country, a stance backed by Russia and China in international organizations. Kosovo\u2019s independence is recognized by more than 100 other countries, including the U.S. and all but five EU states.\n\n(Updates with latest vote count in third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade at msavic2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrea Dudik at adudik@bloomberg.net, ;Irina Vilcu at isavu@bloomberg.net, Tony Czuczka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Kosovo\u2019s opposition parties won an early general election, signaling a turn away from politicians who rose to prominence as guerrilla fighters against neighboring Serbia in the 1990s.With a shared legacy of war holding up European Union membership for both sides, Sunday\u2019s ballot marked", "authors": ["Misha Savic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
