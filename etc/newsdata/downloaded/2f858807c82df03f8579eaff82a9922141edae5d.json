Each has had its own trigger, but many of the tactics and underlying frustrations are similar. Governments, economists and ordinary people are taking notice.\n\nECONOMICS\n\nIn at least four countries beset by recent violent protests, the main reason for the uprising is economic.\n\nGovernments in Chile and Ecuador have incurred their people's wrath after trying to raise fares and end fuel subsidies.\n\nAs clashes engulfed Quito, Ecuadorean President Len\u00edn Moreno tried to negotiate with indigenous leaders who had mobilized people to take to the streets.\n\nAusterity measures in Ecuador spur protests against President Len\u00edn Moreno, Oct. 11, 2019.

People of all ages and religions joined to protest worsening economic conditions and the perception that those in power were corrupt.\n\nRiot police fire tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Beirut, Lebanon, Oct. 18, 2019.
