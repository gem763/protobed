Sinosteel has been committed to WA for a long time and will remain so.\"\n\nMr Griffiths said the Blue Hills iron ore mine, which Sinosteel closed in 2015, was likely to be the first mine that resumes production, and may do so as early as next year through the existing Port of Geraldton.\n\nMr Griffiths said Blue Hills would have been profitable if it were operating in 2019, in a reference to the high iron ore prices caused by supply curtailments in Brazil.\n\nMs MacTiernan believes Geraldton can cater for the region for the forseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe [existing] Geraldton Port is much more tailored in terms of size and cost to the scale of the deposits that we\u2019ve seen. That is economically a much more feasible proposition in our view,\u201d she told the Geraldton Guardian newspaper on Monday.\n\nDespite Ms MacTiernan's scepticism, WA Premier Mark McGowan said his government would welcome any move to forge ahead with Oakajee, which would unlock a path to market for iron ore mines in the state\u2019s mid-west.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe project itself has been talked about for decades so I don\u2019t want to dampen expectations, but I don\u2019t want to elevate expectations too much,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is a commercial arrangement. If it results in a good outcome, then we would welcome that.\"\n\nMr McGowan said he had yet to have discussions with Sinosteel about its plans for Oakajee after an exclusive report in The Australian Financial Review revealed its manoeuvring to integrate the port and rail project with mining interests.\n\nSinosteel's acquisition comes as Western Australia increasingly tries to strengthen its ties with China amid growing tensions between Canberra and Beijing.\n\nEarlier this month, iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group openly rejected Prime Minister Scott Morrison's suggestion that China should be considered a developed nation for the purpose of international trade rules.", "description": "Sinosteel says it's no \"fly-by-nighter\" and will conduct a thorough review before deciding whether to spend billions on port and rail infrastructure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6639%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_106%2C$y_56/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e74bd1667dc267d6368972197cd020f83a69a68", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
