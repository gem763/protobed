Then there\u2019s LSU, which has ranked in the top 50 in offense only three other seasons since 2009, but is producing points and yards at a rate unseen in program history.\n\nWisconsin has posted four shutouts in six games, and Penn State, Ohio State and Iowa give the Big Ten four of the top five defenses.\n\nChuba Hubbard of Oklahoma State was a relative unknown before the season but has emerged to take a wide lead in the rushing race.\n\nNo surprise, a Washington State quarterback (Anthony Gordon) leads the nation in passing. Big surprise, Arkansas State\u2019s Omar Bayless is first in receiving.\n\nSCORING OFFENSE\n\nLSU is one of three teams averaging more than 50 points per game. The Tigers\u2019 average of 52.5 is up significantly over the 31.3 they were scoring through six games last season. LSU has scored in the 60s in two games and hasn\u2019t been held under 42.\n\nAlabama is second at 51 points, five under its six-game average in 2018. Like LSU, the Alabama is yet to score fewer than 42 in a game.\n\nOklahoma, which led the nation last year, is at 50.2.\n\nSCORING DEFENSE\n\nWisconsin is allowing 4.8 points per game on the strength of those four shutouts. The Badgers have given up a total of three points in first halves. Interestingly, a Northwestern team that ranks third to last in the nation in scoring is the one that put up the most points against them (15).\n\nThree other teams allowing single-digit points are Penn State (8.2), Oregon (8.7) and Ohio State (8.8).\n\nNo defense has finished a season under 10 points per game since Alabama\u2019s in 2011.\n\nTOTAL OFFENSE\n\nJalen Hurts-led Oklahoma is averaging 621.7 yards per game - 335.3 through the air and 286.7 on the ground.\n\nLSU is second at 561 and Central Florida is third at 544.3.\n\nTOTAL DEFENSE\n\nWisconsin is allowing 173.7 yards per game - on pace to be the lowest since Oklahoma gave up 169.6 in 1986.\n\nThe Badgers also lead the nation in rushing defense (44.7) and passing defense (129). Opponents are completing just 43.9 percent of their passes.\n\nOhio State is second in total defense at 234 yards; Clemson is third at 254.8.\n\nRUSHING\n\nOklahoma State\u2019s Hubbard is running for 182.3 yards per game, the highest average since Texas\u2019 D\u2019Onta Foreman finished 2016 at 184.3. Hubbard has gone over 200 in three games and has been held under 100 just once.\n\nOhio State\u2019s J.K. Dobbins and Wisconsin\u2019s Jonathan Taylor are in a tight race behind Hubbard. Dobbins is at 137.7 and Taylor, the defending rushing champion, is at 137.5.\n\nPASSING\n\nGordon, like his predecessors in Mike Leach\u2019s \u201cAir Raid\u201d offense, is putting up dizzying numbers. He\u2019s throwing for 435.3 yards per game and is tied with LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow for second with 25 touchdown passes.\n\nBurrow is second at 359.5 yards per game while completing a nation-best 79.6%.\n\nAlabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa is next at 335.2, and he\u2019s thrown 27 TDs against one interception.\n\nRECEIVING\n\nBayless is averaging 140.5 yards per game and his 10 touchdowns - one more than his total through three seasons - is tied with Oklahoma\u2019s CeeDee Lamb for first.\n\nAntonio Gandy-Golden of Liberty is second, at 121.3 yards per game, and is followed by Wake Forest\u2019s Sage Surratt (118.5) and Oregon State\u2019s Isaiah Hodgins (118.2).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball /and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A review of college football statistics at midseason shows a lot of familiar names at or near the top of the charts, and a few surprises, too.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/oklahoma_texas_football_20869_c0-183-5236-3237_s1200x700.jpg?eab01ea108e1048a1ad6bf30d59957992825eda3", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
