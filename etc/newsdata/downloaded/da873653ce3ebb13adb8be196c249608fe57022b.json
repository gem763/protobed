After an initial hiccup saying he\u2019s \"been through\" five years of marriage he explains, \"This guy has a beautiful five years of marriage which, you know, marriage years is different than human years. You know like how dog years \u2013 what is it like seven years? Every marriage is like 100 years.\n\n\"It\u2019s like 500 years of marriage,\" he jokes. Kanye married Kim in 2014 and the couple shares four children, North, Saint, Psalm and Chicago.\n\nThe rapper also spoke about his spiritual awakening and how he thinks it\u2019s the reason for his success and blessings. He used the example of his $68 million (R995 193 600 million) cash return.\n\n\"Last year I made $115 million and still ended up $35 million in debt. This year I looked up, and I just got $68 million returned to me on my tax returns,\" he explained.\n\n\"God is using me to show off.\"\n\nWATCH THE FULL CLIP HERE:\n\nCompiled by Bashiera Parker (Sources: Bang Showbiz, The Late Late Show with James Corden)\n\n(Photo: Splash)", "description": "Kanye says his professional success and his blessings is all due to God.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9537/b5521d6d0b294026887abcf43d8dc359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
