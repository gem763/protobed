The FTC voted to fine the social medial giant a record-breaking $5 billion following a long-running investigation\n\nFacebook was slapped with a $5bn fine by the FTC in July, the largest penalty against a tech firm. Shares in the company, however, jumped up by 1.8 percent following the announcement - as investors expected the punishment could have been more severe\n\nFacebook was fined in connection over its deal with now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, where private information belonging to 87 million people was shared inappropriately.\n\nThe $5bn fine is the largest penalty against a tech firm, but shares in the company jumped up by 1.8 percent following the announcement - as investors expected the punishment could have been more severe.\n\nSeveral Democrats claimed the punishment was a slap on the wrist.\n\nDemocrat representative David Cicilline, who is chair of a congressional antitrust panel, called the $5 billion penalty 'a Christmas present five months early'.\n\nHe said: 'This fine is a fraction of Facebook's annual revenue. It won't make them think twice about their responsibility to protect user data.'\n\nThe tech giant's revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $15.1bn, while the company is worth an estimated $585billion.\n\nThe next stages will be handled by the Justice Department's civil division, though for now it remains unclear how long it will take to finalize.\n\nAccording to WSJ sources, the vote will be reviewed by the Justice Department, as required by protocol, but it's unlikely the verdict will be reversed.\n\nFor now, the specifics of the settlement remain largely unknown, except for the figure which is believed to be in the region of $5 billion.\n\nOnce finalized, the fine will become the largest ever levied on a tech company, but it won't make much of a dent in Facebook's reserves, which registered more than $56 billion in revenue last year alone.\n\nBut the deal may also include other government restrictions on how Facebook handles and regulates user privacy.\n\nFacebook was fined in connection over its deal with now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, where private information belonging to 87 million people was shared inappropriately. The company's chief exec, Alexander Nix, is pictured above\n\nThe divide between Republicans and Democrats on the matter was irked in large by the latter pushing for tougher oversight of Facebook in addition to the fine.\n\nThe FTC's investigation into Facebook began more than a year ago, after the data of millions of users of the social media site wound up in the possession of Cambridge Analytica, a firm assisting with Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica breach came as one of many leaks for the social-media giant, only adding to the FTC's grievances.\n\nIt also acknowledged giving big tech companies like Amazon and Yahoo extensive access to users' personal data, in effect exempting them from its usual privacy rules\n\nIn response, Facebook has since repeatedly vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data, but fell short of FTC expectations.", "description": "Twitter admitted to its users that it had mistakenly sent emails and phone numbers used for 'safety and security purposes' to advertisers, but that it had not shared any privacy information", "authors": ["Ralph R.
