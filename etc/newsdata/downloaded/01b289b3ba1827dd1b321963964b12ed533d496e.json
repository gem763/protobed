Just get rid of it.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Loma Lookboonmee\u2019s corner did after the first round of her UFC on ESPN+ 20 bout vs. Alexandra Albu on Saturday. Albu continuously grabbed Lookboonmee\u2019s shirt in the clinch and ripped a hole through it.\n\nThe referee gave Albu a stern warning but no point deduction, despite the continuous, blatant grabs. Lookboonmee\u2019s corner then removed their fighter\u2019s shirt after it was ripped apart by Albu.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why we removed @lomalookboonmee\u2019s shirt, it\u2019s because it was ripped from her opponent grabbing it. No point deduction for that, though. https://t.co/LFFfNDjk1w pic.twitter.com/vuxcufrC7g \u2014 Daniel Rubenstein (@dannyrube) October 26, 2019\n\nNow that\u2019s not something we usually see, but it made no difference in the outcome. Lookboonmee picked up the split decision win over Albu, becoming not only the first Thai fighter to make the walk to the octagon, but now the first Thai fighter to ever notch a UFC win, too.\n\nA pretty historical and emotional moment for the 23-year-old Tiger Muay Thai fighter.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space. We don\u2019t take it overly serious, and neither should you.
