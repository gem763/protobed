However, they also see politics as the top issue as the run-up to the 2020 general election gets more raucous.\n\nSharon Miller, BofA\u2019s head of small business, told Yahoo Finance the data indicate the environment for small business is moving in the right direction, but there is still more work to be done.\n\nCritics have frequently cited the lack of funding available for women and minority-owned businesses, which struggle with money issues more than their counterparts.
