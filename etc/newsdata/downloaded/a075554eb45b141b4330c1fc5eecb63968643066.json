It was thoroughly deserved.'\n\nJordan remains in the selectors' thoughts in T20s and he is in the squad for the five-match series against New Zealand which marks the start of Chris Silverwood's reign as England head coach.\n\nJordan has made 39 appearances in T20s, second only to Eoin Morgan among those selected\n\nMore importantly, England's preparations for next year's T20 World Cup begin in earnest over the next few weeks although Jordan insists he is not thinking that far ahead.\n\n'Obviously the World Cup is a nice, little carrot at the end of that few months but it will be one game at a time,' said Jordan.\n\n'If you get too far ahead of yourself, you're not actually concentrating on what's in front of you on the day. You can't build those good habits and that momentum.'\n\nPat Brown, Lewis Gregory and Saqib Mahmood are among a number of fresh faces in England's squad and add to an already crowded list of names for a fast bowling spot - although Jordan relishes the competition.\n\nHe said: 'Anything that makes English cricket stronger makes the team stronger and it keeps everyone on top of their game. The more guys that we can have pushing for selection, the more headaches we can give selectors.\n\nYoung stars such as Archer had a good summer, but Jordan is eyeing a return to the team\n\n'We've added a wealth of young talent to the squad which brings in some good energy. It's an opportunity for everyone. I'll have to continue to improve myself and stay on top of my game.'\n\nJordan's 39 international appearances in T20s is second only to England captain Eoin Morgan among the players who will feature in the first warm-up against a New Zealand XI in Lincoln on Sunday.\n\nThe 31-year-old is unfazed by his status, adding: 'Yes, I might be considered a senior player with my experience but I'm always looking to learn off any player whether they're old or young.\n\n'I try to keep my standards as high as possible and try to give my all every day, whether it be in training or a game, so that won't change.\n\n'It's nice (to be in the squad) but nothing that's taken for granted at all.'", "description": "Chris Jordan may not have been part of England's historic World Cup win but he derived plenty of satisfaction from close friend Jofra Archer's starring role in the gripping final in July.", "authors": ["David Charlesworth", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/07/20208710-0-image-a-6_1572071932342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
