Congressional Democrats believe Trump was holding up the military aid to use as leverage to pressure Ukraine and advance his domestic political interests before next year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe July call is central to the impeachment inquiry, and embarrassed Zelenskiy because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners whose support he needs to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s economy and to end the conflict with Russia.\n\nHe said he \u201cdidn\u2019t even check\u201d whether the Ukrainian transcript of the July call is the same as that of the White House, but says \u201cI think they match.\u201d\n\nTrump later said the military aid was frozen because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine, but the move prompted congressional outcry and the money was released in September.\n\nBut Zelenskiy said the call \u201cwasn\u2019t linked to weapons or the story with (Ukrainian gas company) Burisma,\u201d where Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board.\n\nAsked what Ukraine did to persuade the U.S. to release the aid, Zelenskiy said: \u201cWe have many diplomatic contacts. And in case we need to find a solution to questions of this level, questions about our country\u2019s security, we use all our powerful possibilities.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to interfere in any way in the elections\u201d in the U.S., he said. Zelenskiy appears to be playing to both U.S. political camps to ensure Ukraine has continued support no matter who wins the presidential election next year.\n\nZelenskiy said he thought the call would lead to an in-person meeting with Trump, and wanted the American leader to come to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the \u201ckey question\u201d for him was to try to persuade the White House to \u201cchange its rhetoric\u201d about Ukraine as a corrupt and untrustworthy country.\n\nHe said he wanted to meet with Trump in person but that there were \u201cno conditions\u201d set for such a meeting.\n\nHe said he had \u201cseveral calls\u201d with Trump, but bristled at repeated questions about their relationship. \u201cWe are an independent country, we have relations with many countries,\u201d not just the U.S., he said.\n\nA TV and film comedian, Zelenskiy overwhelmingly won the presidency in April on promises to fight corruption and end the five-year conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. He\u2019s treading carefully to ensure continued support from the U.S. while trying to make peace with powerful neighbor Russia.\n\nMost of the questions at Thursday\u2019s unusual media event related to the Russia conflict or Ukraine\u2019s economic troubles.\n\nIn the July call, Trump sought help on two fronts. The first involves Trump\u2019s claims that Ukraine allied with the Democrats in a plot to derail his 2016 presidential campaign. No evidence of such a plot has emerged.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is also pushing Ukraine to investigate any potential wrongdoing by the Bidens. Trump has said the United States has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, though no one has produced evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the former U.S. vice president or his son.\n\nZelenskiy also joked about Trump\u2019s Twitter missives, saying he doesn\u2019t expect a change in U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the future, \u201cbut if there is, we\u2019ll learn about it on Twitter.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/14/77/725b3c84490185298d4d7d8d9058/191010-zelensky-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
