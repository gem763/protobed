An atheist and a monk. A hippie and a Marine.\n\nBut perhaps his most surprising transformation is his latest one: that to investment adviser. That\u2019s because for many years, the 46-year-old Santa Fe, N.M., resident and former monk thought money was \u201cthe root of all evil \u2026 a tool used to manipulate,\u201d he tells MarketWatch.\n\nIndeed, he\u2019d grown up wealthy and amid his parents\u2019 divorce saw firsthand how money \u201ccould be used to control and hurt people.\u201d In his teens, he rejected that by becoming a latter-day hippie but soon found that \u201cmost hippies weren\u2019t any less selfish than my parents \u2014 they just wanted different stuff,\u201d he says. Next stop: college and then the Marines, even the latter of which failed to quell his soul searching. \u201cI was looking for meaning, purpose and direction, and I wanted a real challenge.\u201d It didn\u2019t pan out because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill people for a living.\u201d\n\nDoug Lynam, Thomas Nelson\n\nWhat did stick, for decades: ordination as a monk. Lynam entered a Benedictine monastery in New Mexico at age 22, and he stayed for roughly 20 years. It was there that he learned just how much money and spirituality intertwine, as guests to the Catholic monastery told of their troubles. Indeed, he writes in his new book \u201cFrom Monk to Money Manager\u201d that \u201calmost every visitor who came with a spiritual problem also had a financial problem lurking in the background.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe financial problem is sometimes a root cause and sometimes a by-product \u2014 and sometimes they\u2019re so tangled together it\u2019s hard to know where one ends and the other begins. For example, when one client was dealing with the death of a loved one, their grief and loss were the primary concern. But there was also an estate to probate and no one to help,\u201d he writes in the book. (He left the monastery when he found a new calling, as he puts it: to bring the highest ethical values and the best money-management practices together. He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of money to solve our most pressing global challenges, so we can\u2019t demonize money on the false presumption that it is evil.\u201d)\n\nAlso see: Why the best person to turn to for money advice may be a psychotherapist\n\nDealing with these financial-and-spiritual issues has led Lynam \u2014 now a partner at LongView Asset Management in Santa Fe \u2014 to believe that \u201cGod wants you to be a little wealthy,\u201d he tells MarketWatch.\n\nThe reason: \u201cYou can\u2019t live in a capitalist society without money. Money is the power that allows us to have impact in the world. Without it, you face a lifetime of great pain,\u201d he says. One example he uses: Though the fellow monks he lived among had \u201ca great deal of love and compassion, they had no financial savvy, and so they didn\u2019t have the impact on the world they deserved to have. Not having much money left them feeble.\u201d (When I ask him about Mother Teresa, he responded that even she raised hundreds of millions of dollars to fund her charitable efforts \u2014 using her own financial savvy for a good cause.)\n\nLongView Asset Management Doug leads a client meeting.\n\nFurthermore, he says that money can be part of our higher purpose: \u201cMoney is a spiritual sponge. It absorbs the intent of the user, so when money becomes a part of our spiritual practice it brings us closer to God,\u201d he says. \u201cA healthy spiritual practice requires contemplation and action. Contemplation shows us how to live, but money is a tool that puts contemplation into action. Whether cooking a meal for the homeless or tending to the sick, you\u2019ll need money for food and medicine.\u201d\n\nLynam recognizes that his views may come across as controversial. When I asked him how he reconciled his beliefs about how money and spirituality intertwine with such Bible verses as \u201cBlessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God,\u201d he replied: \u201cWhen we say, \u2018Blessed are the poor,\u2019 we bless them because of the suffering they will face. Money isn\u2019t the problem; poverty is.\u201d The Bible was in print, he notes, long before the advent of modern economics. \u201cPeople who think money and religion are antithetical, I would argue: Where is God not?\u201d he says. \u201cHow could God not be in money? God is in all of us and all around us, but somehow we want to exclude God from money?\u201d\n\nInstead, he says, it\u2019s all about how we earn and use our money that matters \u2014 and doing this well can give money a higher purpose. \u201cSome think that my wealth comes at the expense of someone else, and that\u2019s what makes it dirty, but that\u2019s not [necessarily] the case. No one is in worse shape simply because I earn, save and ethically invest my money.\u201d\n\nHis advice, then, to all of us is to think about how we earn and use our money. Invest so that you protect the future, Lynam advises. And take care of both yourself and others: \u201cYou have to take care of yourself first [financially and spiritually] before you take care of others,\u201d he says, explaining that a failure to do so means you won\u2019t be as able to help others. \u201cTake care of your immediate needs for you and your family, and then work out in concentric circles to help the world.\u201d", "description": "And how he reconciles that with Bible quotes like: \u201c\u2018Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\u201d", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR191_doug1_ZG_20190912103628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
