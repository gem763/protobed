Trudeau has mused about \u201cphasing out\u201d Albertan oil in the past; Parliament\u2019s new power-brokers are considerably less patient.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the campaign, Bloc leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet proposed a radical redistributionist scheme wherein vindictive emissions taxes would be levied on Albertan oil to subsidize new spending in Quebec. The New Democrats, meanwhile, have been steadfast in their opposition to the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline linking Alberta to the Pacific coast \u2014 one of the few energy projects Trudeau has endorsed. These are the baselines from which future negotiations must start.\n\nAD\n\nDramatic hikes in domestic spending will be similarly on the table. \u201cA lot of times when people hear balanced budgets, they hear austerity and they hear cutting their services \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe in that,\u201d said New Democrat head Jagmeet Singh as he unveiled his party platform, which promised a CA $32.7 billion deficit. The prime minister agrees, having run a campaign heavy on demagoguery against \u201cConservative cuts,\u201d after brazenly abandoning a 2015 election promise to have the budget balanced by now.\n\nPresumably, these two spend-happy leaders will find common cause pursuing national Pharmacare, which both have endorsed. With a price tag estimated for at least CA $15 billion annually, it would represent the most costly, redundant and ideological expansion of public healthcare in decades, as Ottawa seeks to provide a service most Canadians feel is adequately handled by private insurance.\n\nAD\n\nA left-wing parliamentary alliance will beget cultural consequences too, including further consolidation of the protected status of French Canadians as the \u201cfirst among equals\u201d in Canada\u2019s hierarchy of minorities.\n\nAD\n\nThe Bloc campaign was aggressive in its defense of the so-called secularism law passed by Quebec\u2019s chauvinistic premier, which denies government jobs to anyone dressed in overtly religious fashion, including turbaned men and hijab-clad women. The Bloc\u2019s strong parliamentary presence will likely intimidate Trudeau even further away from contesting this than he already is, thereby strengthening Quebec\u2019s right to practice a bossy and assimilationist flavor of multiculturalism other provinces cannot.\n\nOfficial bilingualism \u2014 which is to say, mandatory requirements for French fluency for Canadian public servants \u2014 was already on course to be expanded by the Trudeau government. With the need to deflate separatist sails an always front-of-mind concern for this uniquely Quebec-obsessed prime minister, expect future language legislation to be preposterously strict, knowing it will be under the Bloc\u2019s critical eye.\n\nAD\n\nAlong with protections for Quebec particularism, a second Trudeau term will presumably also further institutionalize \u201creconciliation\u201d with Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples as a purported core of the national identity. This will likely mean an end to even nominal federal resistance to even the most audacious aboriginal assertions of territorial jurisdiction or demands for financial compensation. Adopting such a preemptively conciliatory posture will be deeply consequential both economically and legally, but also visibly, as the NDP-backed Liberal administration uses Ottawa\u2019s powers of symbolism and ceremony to entrench restitution for an ongoing \u201cgenocide\u201d as the country\u2019s defining theme.\n\nAD\n\nThe one party that will play no role in any of this is Elizabeth May\u2019s Green Party. Winning only three seats on Monday, it will be mathematically impossible for Green votes to be relevant in any legislative scenario.\n\nThough three parliamentary seats is the most significant accomplishment of the Green Party\u2019s nearly four-decade existence, there are signs May\u2019s grating pride in her party\u2019s chronically meager achievements have finally exhausted the press. Now undeniably stale after running four elections as party boss, her tired rerun of a campaign was widely panned, and her inability to \u201creally, finally, truly\u201d make a breakthrough this time was not sympathetically received. Retirement pressure is now open.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps a small cause for smiles in a night that otherwise offered Conservatives few.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A Trudeau must once again rely on the support of smaller left-wing parties to govern.", "authors": ["J.J.
