Billed as a mini rock opera, it touches on science fiction, religion and the role of the musician in society while pondering the existence of an infinite number of parallel worlds.\n\nIt is also \u2014 mercifully \u2014 essentially tongue in cheek. Provided you take it with a pinch of salt, it should raise a smile. With Justin's guitar-playing brother Dan Hawkins producing and drummer Rufus Taylor (son of Queen's Roger) an excellent rhythmic anchor, it plays unashamedly to the band's melodic strengths.\n\nCrunching power chords and layered harmonies dominate and Justin, 44, can still unleash that trademark falsetto scream.\n\nA Life Of Brian-style sleeve is intended to symbolise the notion of alternative realities, although the fact that this Jesus looks just like Justin feels suspect.\n\nThe singer isn't the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy.\n\nBut the concept of a world governed by musicians rather than politicians gives Easter Is Cancelled an eerily contemporary narrative.\n\nThose themes inform the title track and two epics \u2014 Rock And Roll Deserves To Die and We Are The Guitar Men \u2014 that bookend the album.\n\nRock And Roll Deserves To Die, which nods to Jethro Tull in its acoustic intro and Led Zeppelin in its chorus, dismisses most of today's rock musicians as charlatans covered in lavish tattoos, but with 'nothing real to perform'.\n\nWe Are The Guitar Men provides an effective counterpoint, closing the record by reiterating an unquenchable faith in rock's relevance.\n\nElsewhere, Justin's teenage years are revisited on Live 'Til I Die and there's an affectionate, but hilarious, Liam Gallagher impersonation on Choke On It.\n\nReiterating his eccentric streak, Hawkins recalls an ill-fated childhood boating holiday on the jazzy Deck Chair.\n\nSome of the most convincing moments arrive when the band play it (almost) straight.\n\nHow Can I Lose Your Love expresses regret at a failed relationship and Heart Explodes tugs at the emotions while dissecting the creative process: 'I'm trying to write a ballad that makes you want to stay,' sings Justin.\n\n'They're easy to come up with but difficult to play.'\n\nIt's no surprise that The Darkness are still sought out as touring partners by stars as big as Lady Gaga and Ed Sheeran.\n\nThere will always be a place for good-time rock bands who refuse to take themselves too seriously.\n\nMissouri singer Angel Olsen cut her teeth in punk groups before delving into dance with a brilliant cameo on Mark Ronson's Late Night Feelings.\n\nBruised by a painful romantic breakup, she uses her fourth solo album to reinvent herself as a dark, but dramatic, torch singer.\n\nOlsen, 32, originally wanted to release two versions of All Mirrors simultaneously \u2014 one solo, the other with a band \u2014 but the second idea worked so well that she has shelved the unvarnished model for now.\n\nMissouri singer Angel Olsen cut her teeth in punk groups before delving into dance with a brilliant cameo on Mark Ronson's Late Night Feelings\n\nWith her sultry voice framed by synths and strings, it's a shrewd move.\n\nShe sings with striking power on Lark, embellishing emotive lyrics \u2014 'If only we could start again, pretending we don't know each other' \u2014 with Jherek Bischoff's innovative orchestrations to create a widescreen wonder reminiscent of Arcade Fire.\n\nProducer John Congleton also adds a warm, analogue glow to songs which are new but often feel like long-lost country ballads or Fifties standards.\n\nDreamy dashes of Lana Del Rey surface, but Olsen is fast emerging as a star in her own right.\n\nBoth albums out today.\n\nThe Darkness start a UK tour at The Limelight, Belfast, on November 25 (ticketmaster.co.uk).\n\nAngel Olsen starts her tour on February 10 at SWX, Bristol (angelolsen.com).\n\nNew releases\n\nKRISTIN CHENOWETH: For The Girls (Concord)\n\nRating:\n\nThe Tony-winning Broadway star assembles a stellar cast for this album of pop standards.\n\nDuetting with Oklahoman Chenoweth on Lesley Gore's feminist anthem You Don't Own Me, the versatile Ariana Grande is compelling, while Jennifer Hudson and Reba McEntire add to a dazzling diva-fest on I'm A Woman.\n\nDolly Parton appears on a schmaltzy I Will Always Love You, and Chenoweth shines on a solo Desperado.\n\nKRISTIN CHENOWETH: For The Girls (Concord)\n\nWILCO: Ode To Joy (dBpm)\n\nRating:\n\nStill making worthwhile music 25 years into a career that has redefined U.S. country-rock, Chicago veterans Wilco fall short here.\n\nAiming to substitute 'rockist tropes' with a less hackneyed, folk-based sound, they underscore Ode To Joy with lean instrumentation and a plodding one-two beat.\n\nIt shows great restraint for a six-piece band, but gives much of this return a flat, repetitive feel.\n\nWILCO: Ode To Joy (dBpm)\n\nRIOPY: Tree Of Light (Warner Classics)\n\nRating:\n\nFrench pianist Jean-Philippe Rio-Py made his name writing music for car adverts and films.\n\nNow London-based, he uses this ten-track instrumental LP to mix the subtle technique of Erik Satie and ambient approach of William Orbit.\n\nTheme Music For A Dream, a typical title, floats by with understated elegance, but Rio-Py can also play with passion and power.", "description": "ADRIAN THRILLS: The only surprising thing about the first concept album by The Darkness is that it has taken them so long to come up with one.", "authors": ["Adrian Thrills For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/01/19277888-0-image-a-116_1570148182568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
