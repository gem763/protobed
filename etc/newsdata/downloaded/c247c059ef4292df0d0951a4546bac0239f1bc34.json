The England head coach will have to decide whether or not the Vunipolas, Slade and Nowell will be ready to start against the Wallabies.\n\nThe midfield presents another selection dilemma. Do England continue with George Ford and Owen Farrell side by side or move the England captain back to his preferred position allowing Slade or Jonathan Joseph to join Manu Tuilagi in midfield?\n\nJones looks to have settled on Tom Curry and Sam Underhill as the starting flankers but Mark Wilson has shown his big match temperament before.\n\nJoe Cokanasiga seems to have fallen down the pecking order on the wings with the return of Anthony Watson and Nowell. But the Bath winger is a unique option for England who has demonstrated a try-scoring ability at international level.\n\nWith all these selection issues up for debate, it is over to you to select your starting England XV to take on Australia.", "description": "England take on Australia in the first quarter-final of the Rugby World Cup on Saturday and there are a number of selection dilemmas facing Eddie Jones.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Will Greenwood", "Austin Healey"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000212488701-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBAPjrv3S3zUmnFx0bqEf_XXD-QOcVpkPPZHb0thbQ-8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
