It was a return trip for the president, who traveled there in March 2018 to see border wall prototypes that authorities later destroyed to make way for 14 miles (22.4 kilometers) of steel, concrete-filled bollards currently under construction.\n\nBefore construction began, the border in San Diego was protected by an initial layer of sheet metal that was easily blow-torched and a second, more formidable layer that could be compromised with powerful, battery-operated saws.\n\n\u201cIt was like a sheet metal and people would just knock it over like just routinely,\u201d Trump said, referring to the initial layer that was replaced. He stood with construction workers and top Customs and Border Protection, Army Corps of Engineers and homeland security officials.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He said the wall absorbs heat \u2014 \u201cYou can fry an egg on that wall.\u201d The concrete goes deep into the ground to prevent tunneling. And agents can see through it to spot possible threats on the Mexican side of the border, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the wall is built, it will be virtually impossible to come over illegally, and then we\u2019re able to take border control and put them at points of entry,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe heaped praise on the Mexican government, especially for sending tens of thousands of troops to its northern and southern borders to help slow the flow of migrants headed toward the United States. He said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador \u201chas been great.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all thrilled,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country and now they\u2019re doing just the opposite. They\u2019ve really been incredible.\u201d\n\nThe president reveled in details of construction, saying Border Patrol and military officials persuaded him to adopt more expensive designs. He said he dropped a preference for solid concrete, instead opting for concrete-filled steel bollards that allow agents to see through to Mexico to spot assailants throwing rocks or other projectiles. He agreed to go along with barriers that are 30 feet high and double-layered in heavily traveled areas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Rolls-Royce version,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhen Trump asked Army Corps Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite to explain how technology embedded in the wall alerts agents to illegal activity, he was told, \u201cSir, there could be some merit in not discussing it.\u201d\n\nSemonite offered new details on the pace of construction that underscored how quickly the administration plans to move.\n\nIt has built 66 miles (106 kilometers) so far, has 251 miles (403 kilometers) in various stages of construction at 17 sites and contracts for 163 miles (262 kilometers) planned in the next 90 days, the general said. Additional land on private property is expected to take more time.\n\nCrews are installing 270 panels a day, each one with eight bollards.\n\nTrump, whose construction targets have shifted, said he expects to build up to about 550 miles (885 kilometers) of wall along the 1,954-mile (3,126-kilometer) border and said the administration will pause at about 400 miles (643 kilometers) to assess what more is needed.\n\nTrump said cost concerns led him to put aside his preference to paint the wall black, which absorbs heat. He said the wall was \u201ca good, strong rust color\u201d and could be painted later.\n\nTrump is riding a string of wins on the wall and on immigration in general. Arrests on the Mexican border arrests plunged in August, well beyond the usual summer dip, from a 13-year high reached in May. Arrests are still relatively high, topping 50,000 in 10 of the last 11 months, compared with only eight months over the previous decade.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court gave Trump a green light to deny asylum to anyone who passes through another country on the way to the U.S. border with Mexico without having first sought protection in the third country.\n\nThe Pentagon recently diverted $3.6 billion from 127 military construction projects to build 175 miles (280 kilometers) of barriers on the border. Trump had promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "President Donald Trump has hailed a newly constructed section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall as a \"world-class security system.\"", "authors": ["Kevin Freking", "Elliot Spagat"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19261816122443.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
