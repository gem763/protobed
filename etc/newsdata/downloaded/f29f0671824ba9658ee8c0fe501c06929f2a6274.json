His former club made repeated trips to the French capital to negotiate a deal, but PSG said the Catalans had failed to meet their asking price.\n\nNeymar has since returned to action for the Ligue 1 champions, scoring in 1-0 wins over Strasbourg and Olympique Lyonnais and playing in Wednesday\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Stade Reims.", "description": "Barcelona spent much of the summer trying to bring Neymar back to the club two years after he left to join Paris St Germain but on Friday the Brazilian will come up against his old club in the courtroom to settle a bitter legal dispute.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434459555&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0II-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
