That's a disappointing stat considering the premium EV might have cost owners \u00a3100k\n\nThe Seat Alhambra (2010-current), Ford B-Max (2012-2017) and BMW 5 Series Touring (2010-2017) were also highlighted as having high fault rates, all of which are linked to fairly simple and common problems.\n\nWhich? is calling on manufacturers to 'go public with these inherent flaws' and issue a recall to alert drivers that their car could have a fault and ensure a pre-emptive fix is available free of charge even if a car is not under warranty.\n\nThe consumer group's head of home products and services, Natalie Hitchins, said: 'It is concerning that it has taken Which?'s survey of thousands of motorists to uncover what are in some cases inherent flaws with some of the UK's best-selling cars.\n\n'Owners should be able to trust that manufacturers will make them aware of these issues and offer a fix when they see a recurring problem.\n\n'It is vital these manufacturers make the public aware of these serious faults and ensure vehicle owners are not left out of pocket should the issues occur outside their warranty.'", "description": "One in five owners of Nissan's current Qashqai told Which? that they needed to replace their car's battery in the last year, which is five times the average rate for other models of the same age.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
