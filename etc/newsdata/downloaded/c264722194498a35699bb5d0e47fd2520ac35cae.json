Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nEngel is one of three House Democrats \u2015 along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland \u2015 leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not complying with the inquiry so far,\u201d Engel said of Pompeo during an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that there are discussions that are ongoing and we\u2019re hoping that he will comply.\u201d\n\nPompeo has defended the president\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. He acknowledged last week that he was one of several U.S. officials on the line during Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe call became the subject of a subsequent whistleblower complaint filed in August by a U.S. intelligence official that prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nEngel\u2019s committee issued a subpoena for Pompeo on Sept. 27 that requested he make five State Department officials available for depositions and turn over a slew of documents related to Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings. The deadline for those documents was Friday.\n\nIn response, Pompeo accused Engel of trying to \u201cbully\u201d and \u201cintimidate\u201d department officials and claimed the records requested are potentially privileged and restricted.\n\nEngel said Sunday that Pompeo\u2019s accusations of intimidation are \u201claughable\u201d given the \u201cnumerous complaints\u201d from State Department staffers who have alleged that the Trump administration has discriminated against them.\n\n\u201cPeople who were summarily let go or fired because they were deemed to be the wrong political persuasion or the wrong ethnic persuasion,\u201d Engel told CBS. \u201cI find it really laughable that the secretary of state suddenly has this great concern for the State Department.\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "Rep.
