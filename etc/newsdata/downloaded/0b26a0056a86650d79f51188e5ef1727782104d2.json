And here we offer a sneak peek of what\u2019s in store.\n\nIn The Channel Tunnel - Life On The Inside - we meet \u2018Two Stop\u2019 Tash (pictured), who often needs a couple of goes to get her train to stop in the right spot\n\nThe Channel Tunnel is something of a technological wonder of the world. Pictured are the Folkestone platforms\n\nIn the first episode of the BBC Two series - The Channel Tunnel Life On The Inside - we meet \u2018Two Stop\u2019 Tash, who drives Eurotunnel Shuttles and gets teased by her colleagues for struggling to stop her train at the right spot.\n\nShe often needs to nudge forward before coming to a halt for the final time.\n\nWe also learn about the dangers of \u2018segment flicker\u2019, when the \u2018relentless waves of lines and lights\u2019 experienced by drivers in tunnels can lead to them becoming hypnotised.\n\nTo prevent this, the cabs of the Shuttle trains, which travel at up to 87mph (140kph) in the tunnel, have windows designed with a restricted view.\n\nDescribing the first time she drove on her own in the tunnel, Tash says: \u2018It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever done in my life. Every noise sounded like the train had broken \u2013 even a phone ringing.\n\nThe Channel Tunnel runs for 23.5 miles under the English Channel\u2019s seabed, carries over 20million passengers every year on around 400 trains a day and some of those - the Eurostars - hit speeds of 99mph. Pictured is the English terminal\n\nThe first design for a cross-Channel Tunnel - to be lit by oil lamps for horse drawn carts - was created in 1802. Pictured is the French terminal\n\n\u2018But the more time you spend down here, you get used to the noises and the movement of the train and start to recognise real faults!\u2019\n\nOn the day the cameras joined her in the cab, back in March, she was hauling 32 trucks weighing 2,500 tonnes on a journey lasting about 35 minutes.\n\nThe trains take it all in their stride \u2013 but sometimes things don\u2019t go according to plan.\n\nEach shuttle is almost 800 metres (2,624ft) long, that's the length of seven football pitches\n\nOn May 6, 1994, the Channel Tunnel was official opened by Queen Elizabeth II and French president Francois Mitterand. Pictured is the French portal\n\nA member of the Eurotunnel team scans an incoming queue of traffic\n\nWe also witness the Eurotunnel team choreographing a \u2018recirculation\u2019 \u2013 taking all the trucks off a broken down train and directing them onto another working Shuttle.\n\nIn future episodes the series will reveal why the tunnel isn\u2019t a straight line but bends and weaves like a river beneath the seabed - and how a team must battle to fix overhead cables crackling with 25,000 volts in the 'wet area', while keeping an eye out for a family of adders.\n\nThe BBC said: \u2018With never-before-seen footage and spellbinding stories, The Channel Tunnel - Life On The Inside, reveals what it\u2019s really like inside one of the world\u2019s busiest transport systems.\u2019\n\nThe first episode will air on BBC Two on Wednesday, October 9, at 7.30pm.", "description": "It runs for 23.5 miles under the English Channel, carries over 20m passengers a year on 400 trains a day and some of those hit 99mph.
