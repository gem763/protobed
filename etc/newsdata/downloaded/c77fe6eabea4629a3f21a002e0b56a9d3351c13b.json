And even among Labour supporters, 48 per cent said he was performing badly on EU withdrawal policy, against 34 per cent who said he was doing well.\n\nThe monthly political monitor poll recorded the lowest net satisfaction ratings for Mr Corbyn of any opposition leader since the survey began in 1977. Some 76 per cent said they were dissatisfied with the Labour leader\u2019s performance against 16 per cent who were satisfied \u2013 a net rating of minus-60.\n\nThe Labour leadership is expected to try to water down pro-Remain demands in a \u201ccompositing\u201d meeting on Sunday which will decide the wording of the Brexit motion to be put to delegates later in the week. Some 90 per cent of motions submitted call for Labour to back Remain in any public vote, while a majority support the revocation of Article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal.\n\nBut Corbyn loyalist Richard Burgon backed the current position as \u201ccorrect and democratic\u201d, telling The Independent it \u201cmakes sense\u201d for Labour MPs to be allowed to campaign on either side in an eventual referendum.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And he said it would be \u201ccredible\u201d for Mr Corbyn to stand aside from the fray rather than backing one side in a second public vote.\n\n\u201cAs a democrat who got into politics to try to bring people together, I think it\u2019s right that Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister would \u2013 no ifs, no buts \u2013 implement the decision of that referendum vote, whether it\u2019s to leave with the deal that Labour negotiates or to remain,\u201d he said.\n\nLeading shadow cabinet members Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Dawn Butler will be among those taking part in the Trust the People march in favour of a referendum, alongside Mr Kyle and Green MP Caroline Lucas.\n\nMs Lucas said: \u201cOffering everyone in the country the final say in a new referendum is the best way to heal divides over Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe far right of the Tory party now occupying Downing Street want to impose a form of Brexit on the British people that is a million miles from what they once promised.\n\n\u201cAnd there are those who simply want to see parliament overturn the result of the last referendum.\n\n\u201cEither course will only deepen divisions in our country. Neither can be called democratic. The only fair way to solve this crisis and get a lasting settlement is through a people\u2019s vote, and a programme to transform Britain so people\u2019s very real grievances can be addressed.\u201d\n\nSetting out his plan for a parliamentary amendment to force Mr Johnson to put any deal to a public vote, Mr Kyle said: \u201cNo one can trust Boris Johnson to solve this Brexit crisis either with no deal or a deal.\n\n\u201cIf he tries to force his vision for a destructive Brexit through parliament, we will seek to amend it so that it can only proceed if the people get the chance to have the final say.\u201d\n\nIpsos Mori\u2019s research director Keiran Pedley said: \u201cCorbyn\u2019s historically dire personal poll ratings will concern Labour supporters as the party heads into an expected general election.\n\n\u201cWhen Tony Blair and David Cameron assumed office from opposition, both had positive net satisfaction scores, while Corbyn\u2019s currently stands at minus-60.\n\n\u201cHowever, he was able to significantly improve his personal poll ratings during the 2017 general election campaign, so perhaps he will again. Whether he can do so against the backdrop of a resurgent Lib Dems and lukewarm public support for his Brexit stance remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Burgon insisted the Labour leader would be an asset in an election which he believes will come before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOnce a no-deal Brexit is finally locked down as not happening, we need a general election to get Boris Johnson out by Christmas, whether that is by voting down the Queen\u2019s Speech or a vote of no confidence,\u201d said the shadow justice secretary.\n\n\u201cI believe we will come out of this conference in a better position to unify the vast majority of anti-Tory, pro-progressive change voters behind Labour. People will see a clear choice been Johnson\u2019s hard-right Conservatives and the real change offered by Labour and Jeremy Corbyn will be a strength in that election, just as he was in 2017.\n\nIpso Mori questioned 1,006 British adults between 13 and 16 September", "description": "Labour MPs are to make a fresh bid to force a second referendum on any Brexit deal secured by Boris Johnson.
