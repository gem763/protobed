Tehran wanted everyone to know about it\u2014state TV broadcasted the military exercise live.\n\nIt\u2019s a revealing look at Iranian naval assault tactics, involving several waves of ships backed by helicopters and shore-launched missiles. The timing isn\u2019t a coincidence. The United States and Iran are deadlocked over a deal to curb Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nThe Iranians built the giant, 1:1-scale mock-up of the carrier on top of a barge almost one year ago. Photos released from Iranian news agencies on Feb. 25 now show it as a smoldering wreck. The missiles Iran fired at it are very real.\n\nBut don\u2019t panic. The exercise\u2014known as Great Prophet 9\u2014didn\u2019t factor in American escort warships and warplanes responsible for defending real carriers. It was mostly just for show.\n\nThe exercise occurred near Larak Island near the Strait of Hormuz. On the island, Mohammad Ali Jafari\u2014the chief of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2014and the head of the conservative parliament watched from stands.\n\nFirst, IRGC navy speedboats performed a mining operation to isolate the \u201ccarrier\u201d and limit its maneuverability. Dozens of small speedboats\u2014each armed with an M-08 contact mine\u2014swarmed around the mock up. Iranian state television claimed \u201ca vast area was mined in under 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nDuring the second phase, the speedboats attacked the giant ship with 107-millimeter rockets. These are small rockets, and likely couldn\u2019t sink a warship the size of an aircraft carrier.\n\nBut Iran could intend this tactic as a means to disable critical self-defense systems, such as radars, Phalanx CIWS self-defense cannons and missile launchers.\n\nNext, speedboats armed with small cruise missiles\u2014likely Chinese-made C-704 anti-ship cruise missiles\u2014attacked the ship. These fast speedboats fired a barrage of 12 cruise missiles toward the mock Nimitz.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Could this become a reality?", "authors": ["Jassem Al Salami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ivdg3CStAeZ3G4XmGgCDAw--~B/aD05NTg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/8d5b2d0089dbd820e5d496982c3c0345", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
