Unidentified woman: \u201cIf they were reflecting the views of the people they would get on with it but I don\u2019t think they ever will to be honest. It\u2019s been what, three years, since we voted Out and we\u2019re still waiting, they\u2019re just sitting on their bums, in my eyes \u2013 just get out of Brexit would be the best for Britain.\u201d\n\nOut of a limited, quickly executed and entirely unscientific sample of the limited, quickly executed and entirely unscientific vox pops to have littered the BBC\u2019s recent news coverage, the above, from Aylesbury, is my favourite contribution. The Today programme\u2019s news correspondent must, justifiably, have been hugging herself.\n\nIt seems to be easy \u2013 though, admittedly, we never know how many were auditioned \u2013 to source people in markets who\u2019ll say such things as \u201cjust get on with it\u201d or \u201che\u2019s doing a good job\u201d or \u201cjudges don\u2019t speak for the man in the street, do they?\u201d. But to find, as Sima Kotecha did, the judicial ruling being so effortlessly conflated with \u201cthey\u201d, the opponents of \u201cthe people\u201d, with \u201cbums\u201d and \u201cBritain\u201d uttered in the same sentence \u2013 by someone who sounds annoyed, but not weird \u2013 must be the dream response to the presenter\u2019s introduction: \u201cSo, how did that momentous supreme court decision go down among voters?\u201d\n\nBBC vox pops rarely allow cross-cutting \u2013 or any other conventional measure of productive public discourse\n\nFair dos: Kotecha indicated, as much as you can in a report featuring three anti-judge and two anti-Johnson contributions, that voters differ on its momentousness. Some will agree with the Aylesbury man \u2013 who was name-checked though not age-checked, according to a BBC vox pop rubric that is as mysterious as its treatment of opinion polls is transparent \u2013 that politicians \u201cshouldn\u2019t be able to break the law, it\u2019s disgusting\u201d.\n\nThen again, there was this from \u201ca mother of one\u201d: \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of the country, the Queen sort of said it was OK for him to suspend parliament.\u201d And if the Queen was misled? But we\u2019d moved on.\n\nBBC vox pops rarely allow cross-cutting \u2013 or any other conventional measure of productive public discourse. In fact, this eager dissemination of unfounded, unchallenged, occasionally misleading or alcohol-misted opinion only contributes to the impression, reinforced by Question Time, that voter deliberation, if not actively redundant, is decreasingly a BBC priority, unlike the successive splats of tweet-like assertions. Hence, among the insights on parliament, on the World at One: \u201cDon\u2019t like the heat, get out of the kitchen, that\u2019s their job innit?\u201d Or, on Today, this Bexleyheath drinker on the judges: \u201cThat was in the paper today, that they\u2019re all Remainers.\u201d\n\nDebate itself can emerge as strikingly unpopular in these dodgy portraits of \u201cthe nation at large\u201d, as Newsnight framed its package of star opinionators. Cross woman in Maidstone cafe: \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, they\u2019re just arguing and arguing and arguing and not doing anything, they\u2019re just having a go at Boris.\u201d Rarely can the Habermasian route to democratic consensus have been more compellingly demolished.\n\nThe elevation of the five- or six-person vox pop has lately become insistent enough to suggest a BBC policy directive rather than old-fashioned laziness, economy, contempt or desperation. A new \u201cpop-up newsroom\u201d in Stoke, the UK\u2019s most Remain constituency, was advertised by the BBC\u2019s news director, Fran Unsworth, as \u201can important initiative, as we become more audience focused and change the way we gather news\u201d. In practice, one of the pop-up\u2019s many contributions, a weekday shopping-centre vox pop on the World at One, sounded remarkably similar to standard offerings: random, unenlightening, conducted at a time and in circumstances unfriendly to time-poor people, as bereft of under-18s (parental consent required) as it is of any claim to sociological significance, and for reasons of both convenience and disinhibition, anonymous.\n\nWoman on the unlawful suspension of parliament: \u201cI don\u2019t really think people on the top should really have that say, personally, he\u2019s governing the country isn\u2019t he and that\u2019s what he should do, govern the country.\u201d Next up, a man: \u201cIt\u2019s just sheer madness, we\u2019ve had three years\u2026\u201d\n\nWould it be simpler, in fact, to reclassify this sort of pointless improv as entertainment?\n\nWithout formal analysis of the BBC\u2019s vox pop output \u2013 just a voter returning the compliment \u2013 the impression that these are often unbalanced accounts of national thinking is supported by recent media scholarship. New research also shows \u201cthe direction of the vox pop viewpoint\u2026 has a direct effect on people\u2019s personal opinions\u201d.\n\nSo, if this shambolic stuff is \u2013 whether for low, craven or visionary reasons \u2013 to be increasingly commonplace on BBC news and current affairs, the conflict between its traditional, informing ambitions and this form of mischief dictates some rapid adjustments to the editorial guidelines. Would it be simpler, in fact, to reclassify this sort of pointless improv as entertainment? Already, BBC rules look radically more permissive than in 2014. Then: \u201cVox pops are a tool of illustration, NOT a tool of research\u2026 Avoid terminology such as: \u2018We\u2019ve been out on the streets to find out what the people of Manchester think about this\u2019.\u201d Now, on The World at One, we\u2019re introduced to \u201cthe view from Stoke\u201d. A view that, as extracted and depicted by the BBC plays colourfully and, as above, influentially into narratives of the people versus parliament.\n\nEven current guidelines require, though you\u2019d rarely guess, some clarifying context, since vox pops \u201conly illustrate some aspects of an argument and do not give any indication of the weight or breadth of opinion\u201d. As much as Stoke merits attention, there are reasons to ask why vox pops from this 69.4% pro-Brexit city should have repeatedly featured in BBC state-of-the-nation snapshots, in a politically febrile week, when the nation appears, in a credible poll, to be 53% pro-Remain.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if we don\u2019t know, from the case of Naga Munchetty, how much the BBC deplores any suspicion of partiality.\n\n\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist", "description": "Broadcasting random comments from \u2018the people\u2019 is no substitute for real news-gathering", "authors": ["Catherine Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60472eaf21dd73a3fb90f4dec2e8d9f0a4c54ae9/0_81_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c3c3e220d92260d066c6b68775bc0538", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
