This new report takes each bird's biology into account, unlike the old report.\n\nANTARCTICA ICE SHELVES' EDGES BEING ATTACKED BY WARM OCEAN WATER, STUDY CLAIMS\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Nearly two-thirds of America's breeding bird species are at risk of extinction amid a warming climate, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/woodpecker-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
