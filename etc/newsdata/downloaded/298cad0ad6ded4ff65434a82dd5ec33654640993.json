Traders are looking to catch some quick gains and the big-picture grizzles are going to stand aside before they return to work next week.\n\nAt the open here on Friday morning the S&P 500 is very close to testing key overhead resistance right at the 50-day simple moving average at around 2945. There is unlikely to be enough action to break that level with vigor, but it will produce a very interesting setup for traders to contemplate on Tuesday.\n\nIn the past week the S&P 500 has gone from threatening to test underlying resistance around 2835 to breaking to the upside over 100 points higher. It is classic trading range action and astute traders are very aware that it is dangerous to be too trusting until levels are broken and there isn't an immediate reversal.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind here on Friday is that the positive action is not likely to be a very good predictor of sustained momentum next week. There will be some major reshuffling as we move into September, which is typically one of the weakest months of the year.\n\nThe debate about China, the potential for a recession and the likely moves by the central banks will dominate the discussion. There is a lull before third-quarter earnings season starts and that will make stock picking challenging.\n\nEnjoy the trading and the upbeat mood today but don't become too comfortable. The atmosphere is going to undergo some sudden changes when we return to work on Tuesday.", "description": "Upbeat holiday trading in advance of Labor Day looks to continue on Friday, but the dreaded month of September, typically one of the weakest months of the year, looms large.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Upbeat Holiday Trading Continues But Dreaded September Looms Large", "The Calendar Is About To Turn To What Typically Is One Of The Weakest Months Of The Year", "So Traders Should Not Become Too Comfortable.", "Bob Ciura", "Jim Collins", "Bruce Kamich", "Paul Price", "Kevin Curran"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c6153f70-b7b7-11e9-b14e-b947a690d4c6.png"}
