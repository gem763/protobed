So all that hard work in the gym and in the treatment room has paid off, which is pretty special.\n\n\"It's tough to overcome those dark days but I'm lucky that at Sarries and here with Scotland I'm surrounded by good people, good physios and good S and C (strength and conditioning) staff who have all kept me positive and on the straight and narrow.\n\n\"I never feared the worst. I always had positive feedback from the physios which meant I never allowed those dark thoughts to enter my mind. Everyone was sure I'd be back to my best when I was able to get fit.\n\n\"The last nine or 10 months has obviously been a massive learning curve but I think I've built up a bit of mental resilience through these injuries.\n\n\"I feel as strong mentally as I ever have. It has been properly mentally challenging these last few years but being surrounded by such amazing people has really helped. I feel if there are more injuries that come along in my career I'm in a good place to deal with them.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Scotland centre Duncan Taylor has revealed his World Cup dream was the light that led him through his three-year injury nightmare.
