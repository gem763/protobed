But the problem, apart from potentially screwing up a bunch of utilities, is that Windows updates always leave a lot of temporary files and other space-stealing junk on your PC. This can accumulate over time and eat up many wasted gigabytes, which you may not be able to spare\u2014nor should you have to.\n\nThe Best Features Coming In Windows 10 Version 1909 It\u2019s almost time for Microsoft\u2019s semi-annual Windows 10 system update. Unlike the smaller, routine updates Windows 10 gets throughout the year, the April and October updates are when we get new features and see the largest changes to the ever-evolving OS. Read more\n\nTo head off this problem, it\u2019s a good idea to clean up these temporary files after every major Windows 10 update. It\u2019s an easy process which first illustrated in a recent groovyPost article.\n\nOpen up Windows 10's Settings app, then the system section, and then the storage section. If you then scroll down, you will see an option that says \u201cFree Up Space Now.\u201d Click that.\n\nScreenshot: groovyPost\n\nWindows will now scan your computer and present you with a list of items that you can safely delete. Be sure to read each description carefully to make sure you really do want to delete it\u2014once something is gone, there are no do-overs.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling nervous for any reason, consider making a system restore point before you wipe these temporary files away, in the rare chance something goes wrong. As you probably already know, a system restore point will \u201croll back\u201d your PC to an earlier version if something is wrong with it.\n\nTo make a system restore point in Windows 10:\n\nOpen up your Start menu and search for \u201cCreate a restore point.\u201d\n\nClick the result \u201cSystem Properties.\u201d\n\nWhen the box opens, select the main system drive under \u201cProtection Settings\u201d, and click the \u201cCreate\u201d button.\n\nEnter a description to identify the restore point. I usually use just the date.\n\nClick \u201cCreate.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: groovyPost\n\nGoing back to reclaiming your hard drive space, if you go piecemeal, the one item that will make a big difference to delete are any files associated with \u201cPrevious Windows installations.\u201d As you can see from the screenshot above, old files that we no longer needed ate up 28 gigabytes of space\u2014that\u2019s not a lot if your drive capacity is a terabyte or more, but it\u2019s quite a bit for a smaller-capacity SSD.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to make your choices, tick the boxes for the items you want deleted and click the \u201cRemove Files\u201d button at the bottom. You may have to restart the computer to finish the job, but get ready to enjoy all the free space you\u2019ve saved once Windows loads up again.\n\nHow to Free Up Tons of Drive Space After Windows 10 1809 Update | groovyPost", "description": "It feels like Microsoft is ramping up its major system updates for Windows, with one now coming every six months or so.
