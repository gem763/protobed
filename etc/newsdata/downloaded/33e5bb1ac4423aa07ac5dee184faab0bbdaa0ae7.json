Don\u2019t be shy about adding the entire tablespoon of pepper, as it balances out the richness of the beef and adds a lightly spicy bite to the dish. A quick rub of garlic, brown sugar, salt, pepper and cornstarch seasons the beef; the cornstarch helps tenderize the beef and later imparts a silky texture to the sauce. Feel free to marinate the beef up to 8 hours ahead and cook when you're ready. If leftovers remain, tuck them into a crunchy baguette or roll them into a wrap.", "description": "Coarsely crushed black peppercorns star in this quick weeknight dish, which is built primarily from pantry staples Don\u2019t be shy about adding the entire tablespoon of pepper, as it balances out the richness of the beef and adds a lightly spicy bite to the dish A quick rub of garlic, brown sugar, salt, pepper and cornstarch seasons the beef; the cornstarch helps tenderize the beef and later imparts a silky texture to the sauce", "authors": ["Sue Li", "Tejal Rao", "Lidey Heuck", "Nigella Lawson", "Sam Sifton", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Yewande Komolafe", "Alison Roman", "Melissa Clark", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/sl-cabbage-stir-fry/sl-cabbage-stir-fry-articleLarge.jpg"}
