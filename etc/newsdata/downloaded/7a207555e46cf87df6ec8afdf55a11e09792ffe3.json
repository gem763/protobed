But that\u2019s something that\u2019s resonating in Michigan and Pennsylvania suburbs, those sorts of areas.\u201d\n\nAsked by The Federalist specifically whether tying Democrats to socialism is working to win back college-educated suburban women, McDaniel replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak out of turn, but I\u2019ve been sitting in focus groups. I mean, this is something that we are seeing that they do not like.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhere the left is going \u2014 open borders, no rule of law, health care for undocumented immigrants \u2014 these are things that when you come down to the binary choice, maybe they say, \u2018Okay, I don\u2019t like this about what\u2019s happening right now, but here\u2019s what\u2019s coming my way. And this means poverty. This means a government takeover of my private health care plan, maybe losing my private health care plan. I like my doctor, I like my pediatrician, I don\u2019t want the government taking those things away.'\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when you frame it that way, it does move them back,\u201d McDaniel revealed.\n\nLater referencing Democratic attempts to avoid socialist billing, the chairwoman asserted, \u201cThey\u2019re shrinking from being labeled that because they know that it\u2019s moving numbers too.\u201d\n\nIn terms of approval numbers, the president does appear to be struggling with suburban women, but McDaniel\u2019s suggestion that Republicans triumph when swing-state suburban women are forced to confront a \u201cbinary choice\u201d between the GOP and a socialist is important insight into the party\u2019s strategy. As the GOP escalates efforts on behalf of Trump and other 2020 candidates, expect Republicans to work hard making the case their opponents are socialists, and Democrats to sprint away from that labeling.", "description": "RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel says framing Democratic candidates as proponents of socialism is boosting the GOP's appeal among college-educated suburban women.", "authors": ["Emily Jashinsky"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-05-at-1.12.43-PM-e1567703634138.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
