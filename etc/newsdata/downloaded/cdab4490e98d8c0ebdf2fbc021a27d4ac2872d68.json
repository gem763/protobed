She plays Ellen Martin, a Michigan grandmother whose attempts to do apparently straightforward things like settle an insurance claim and buy a new condo are ensnared in complicated schemes that defy rational comprehension. The companies she deals with are shells within shells, paper entities confected in the Mossack Fonseca offices, where accountability is laundered along with money.\n\nThe anecdotes assembled to illuminate the firm\u2019s shady practices \u2014 and to give context to Ellen\u2019s predicament \u2014 would make for tawdry and depressing reading. An expatriate oligarch cheats on his wife with their daughter\u2019s best friend. The wife of a high-ranking Chinese official poisons a British businessman. Corruption is so normal that decency seems outlandish. Soderbergh and his top-notch cast (Sharon Stone shows up, as do Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts) keep things lively, playing out parables of betrayal and deception with pulpy, TV-movie flair.\n\nRather than trying to elicit horror or pity, \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d aims to provoke a sense of spirited outrage, the sort of righteous disgust that might express itself through reform-minded citizen action. There\u2019s no reason to be cynical about that. The main question about a movie like this is whether it can awaken viewers who aren\u2019t already in agreement with its perspective and aware of the overall shape of its argument. The second question \u2014 the critic\u2019s question, if no one else\u2019s \u2014 is whether it succeeds as a movie independent of the merits of that argument.\n\nThat\u2019s a tricky one. Since he ended his brief retirement from filmmaking in 2017, Soderbergh has plied his craft with scrappy exuberance. Like \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d and \u201cHigh Flying Bird,\u201d \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d has an unpretentious, seat-of-the-pants vibe, even though the story and some of the effects are fairly elaborate. Not everything works. There is a labored surprise involving Streep that seems almost like an act of trolling intended to challenge the liberal good will on which the movie otherwise depends. And Oldman\u2019s German accent is so grating that you may wish Mossack had been the silent partner so Banderas could have done all the talking.\n\nBut for a movie about how awful the world is and how it got that way, \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d is kind of a lark.\n\nThe Laundromat\n\nRated R . Lucre doesn\u2019t get much filthier than this. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes.", "description": "In a film about the Panama Papers scandal, Steven Soderbergh convenes a seminar in international finance, with Antonio Banderas, Gary Oldman and Sharon Stone.", "authors": ["A.O.
