Nine people remain missing in landslides and flooding, it said.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across the country as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 80 injuries have been reported so far, while more than 270,000 households lost power, NHK said.\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, with a whopping 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after.\n\nEven as the typhoon moved away from the capital late on Saturday, one expert warned of further flooding as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now worse than this evening,\u201d Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, told Reuters. About 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of potential for once in decades rain totals. It later downgraded the alert level for several prefectures, including Tokyo.\n\n\u201cDamage from floods and landslides is likely taking place already,\u201d an agency official told a news conference carried by NHK. \u201cIt is critical that people take action urgently to protect their lives and the lives of loved ones.\u201d\n\nA residential area is flooded in Ise, Mie Prefecture, central Japan, ahead of the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, in this photo taken by Kyodo October 12, 2019.

Usually bustling entertainment and shopping districts such as Shibuya and Ginza were deserted.\n\nTokyo Disneyland was closed on Saturday, its first weather-related closure since 1984, and supermarkets ran out of bottled water, batteries and other disaster-related goods.\n\nMany people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities early, before the worst of the storm arrived.\n\nYuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community center in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit.\n\nShe said she decided to move before it was too late.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\u201d Ikemura told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (34 Images)\n\n\u201cWe brought with us the bare necessities. I\u2019m scared to think about when we will have run out diapers and milk.\u201d\n\nJapanese Formula One Grand Prix organizers canceled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday. Two matches of the Rugby World Cup due to be played on Saturday were also canceled.\n\nThe Defence Ministry set up a new Twitter account to disseminate information on disaster relief efforts.", "description": "One of the most powerful typhoons to ever hit Tokyo paralyzed the Japanese capital on Saturday, leaving millions confined indoors and streets deserted as fierce rain and wind killed two, flooded rivers and threatened widespread damage.", "authors": ["Makiko Yamazaki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440057575&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0DL", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
