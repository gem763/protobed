As one of only four low-lying coral atoll nations in the world, the failure of the international community to adequately respond to the global climate crisis of its own making holds particularly grave consequences. pic.twitter.com/S9rPPbxw38 \u2014 Dr. Hilda C. Heine (@President_Heine) October 10, 2019\n\nDutton has not yet commented on whether the carbon-belching international community should be charged for the damage done to vulnerable nations like the Marshall Islands, but maybe that\u2019s coming on his next Today appearance.\n\nREAD MORE QLD Premier Palaszczuk Will Fast-Track Laws That Could Jail Climate Protesters", "description": "The Home Affairs Minister again called for tougher penalties on 'The Today Show'.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/peter-dutton-1-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
