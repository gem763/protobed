Nvidia revenue hit $11.7 billion in its 2018-2019 fiscal year and looks as if it will top $12 billion this year.\n\nPointing to Intel\u2019s comments on higher-than-expected demand in its data center business, which focuses on server chips, RBC lifted its price target on Nvidia to $251 to $217, forecasting that the chipmaker will likely experience higher growth relative to CPU server demand.\n\nNvidia surged more than 3.8% higher.\n\n\u201cNvidia will experience a return to growth as utilization of GPUs (graphics processing units) in the Data Center have officially improved and are no longer running below normal,\u201d RBC said in a note to clients.\n\nThe anticipated return for data center growth comes just as U.S.-China relations are seemingly on the mend.\n\nThe United States and China are close to finalizing some sections of their \"phase one\" trade agreement after a phone call between both trade teams, CNBC reported on Friday, citing a statement from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nRBC also said investors were too cautious on Nvidia\u2019s gaming business, which still makes up the bulk of revenue. That echoed earlier sentiments from some of its peers on Wall Street.\n\nEarlier this month, Evercore ISI raised its price target on Nvida to $225 from $185, on the back of expectations for a ramp up in gaming demand and a recovery in the data center division, driven by an anticipated product refresh.\n\nNvidia is up about 53% so far this year and currently has an average price target of $193.10, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com.", "description": "Stockbeat: Nvidia Rallies on RBC Price Hike as Intel Touts Data Center Comeback", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB440WA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
