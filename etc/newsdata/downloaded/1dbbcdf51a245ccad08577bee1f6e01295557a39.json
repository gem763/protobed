Without it, the global economy would simply halt. This bottom-line absolute necessity gives a resilience to energy companies that strengthens them in the markets and attracts positive attention from Wall Street\u2019s analysts.\n\n\u201cWe believe favorable technicals, improving fundamentals with stabilizing business cycle, and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could help redirect flows into this universally hated and cheap [energy] sector,\u201d said JP Morgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Buja.\n\nWe\u2019ve opened up TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener to find three Strong Buy energy stocks that combine positive analyst endorsements with high upside. Each represents a different segment of the energy sector, and each shows how an energy company can leverage the unique features of a particular niche to boost the stock and benefit shareholders.\n\nEnphase Energy: 41% Upside\n\nThe market leader in microinverter solar technology, Enphase (ENPH \u2013 Get Report) has shipped over 10 million microinverters to the North American, European, and Australian residential and commercial markets. Solar energy \u2013 clean and infinite \u2013 is widely considered a major source of future commercial power generation, and microinverters are an important part of a solar system. The devices convert the direct current power from a photovoltaic panel into the alternating current used on electrical grids. Enphase was the first company to set up successful, large-scale microinverter production. Year-to-date, Enphase stock is up a whopping 370%.\n\nThe company\u2019s leading role in its niche has prompted JPMorgan\u2019s 4-star analyst Mark Strouse to initiate coverage of the stock with a 'buy' rating and a $32 price target. He says, \u201cWe are encouraged by ENPH\u2019s fundamental outlook, driven by industry tailwinds (unit growth in solar, MLPE share gains against traditional string inverters, residential energy storage penetration), as well as company-specific tailwinds (new products, improving margins and cash flow, international expansion opportunities).\u201d Strouse\u2019s price target suggests room for an additional 43% upside in the coming 12 months. (To watch Strouse's track record, click here)\n\nStrong products and a clear path to monetization are a firm foundation for any company, and Gus Richard, of Northland Securities, sees plenty of both at Enphase. In his recent research note on the company, Richard says, \u201cENPH product offerings are shifting away from components to energy management solutions. The Company is developing software and hardware that allow a consumer to optimize its production and usage of electricity with the introduction of its Ensemble solution that incorporates its new inverter IQ 8 and Encharge its battery solution. The Ensemble solution will expand the Company\u2019s revenue opportunity per household from $2K to $10K.\u201d Richard\u2019s $40 price target implies an impressive upside potential of 79%.\n\nOverall, Enphase has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. In the last three months, 8 top analysts have reviewed this stock, and all have given buy ratings. Shares are currently selling for $22, and the $31 average price target suggests an upside of 41%.
