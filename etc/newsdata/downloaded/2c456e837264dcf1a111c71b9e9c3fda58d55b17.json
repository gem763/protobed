During his tenure, the California-based company was the fifth-largest U.S. hotel chain. He amassed a net worth of $1.25 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mr. Hilton oversaw the acquisition of the Flamingo Hotel and Las Vegas International, later renamed Las Vegas Hilton. The move made Hilton Hotels the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange to enter the U.S. gaming industry.\n\nAs chairman, Mr. Hilton worked with chief executive Stephen Bollenbach to expand the company\u2019s casino operations into Mississippi and Atlantic City and to acquire a competitor, Bally Entertainment, for about $3 billion in 1996. Two years later, the executives spun off their gambling unit.\n\nMr. Hilton was co-chairman in 2007, when Blackstone Group acquired Hilton Hotels \u2014 by then the nation\u2019s No. 2 hotel operator \u2014 for $26 billion.\n\nEarlier in his career, Mr. Hilton oversaw the development of the Carte Blanche credit card, which the company sold in 1966 for $12 million. He pioneered the profitable practice of real estate sale-leasebacks, selling the equity in hotels while continuing to manage them.\n\nOutside the family business, Mr. Hilton joined with Texas oilman Lamar Hunt and others in 1960 to found the American Football League, a rival of the National Football League. Mr. Hilton was the original owner of the league\u2019s Los Angeles Chargers. The franchise later moved to San Diego and has since returned to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1966, the AFL and NFL announced a merger, which was completed four years later. Mr. Hilton sold his majority stake in the Chargers in 1966.\n\n\u201cThe happiest days of my life were the days I was involved with the Chargers,\u201d he said, according to a 2009 Los Angeles Times story.\n\nWilliam Barron Hilton was born Oct. 23, 1927, in Dallas. He was 8 when his parents divorced.\n\nHe had two brothers, Eric Hilton, who became an executive at Hilton Hotels, and Conrad Nicholson (\u201cNicky\u201d) Hilton Jr., a socialite and manager of Hilton\u2019s international division. Barron Hilton was best man at Nicky\u2019s 1950 marriage to movie star Elizabeth Taylor; the couple divorced within a year.\n\nOther well-known family members include Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton, his granddaughters and high-living heiresses. Eric Hilton died in 2016.\n\nBarron Hilton said he had \u201ca misspent youth\u201d and was \u201ckicked out of four or five schools,\u201d according to a 1981 story in People magazine. He said he wasn\u2019t close to his father, whose hotel empire began in Texas in 1919.\n\nMr. Hilton skipped college and served in the Navy as a photographer\u2019s mate. In 1954, he became vice president at Hilton Hotels.\n\nWhen Conrad Hilton died in 1979, he gave much of his fortune to his private foundation, which benefited charities. Barron Hilton challenged his father\u2019s will and after several years of legal wrangling reached a settlement giving him effective control over 34 percent of the company\u2019s stock.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Hilton announced he would follow his father\u2019s example and leave 97 percent of his estate to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. The planned gift is projected to increase the endowment to $6.3 billion from $2.9 billion, according to the foundation.\n\nOne of Mr. Hilton\u2019s passions was flying, and he owned a fleet of airplanes, helicopters, gliders and ultralight aircraft. He sponsored attempts to circumnavigate the globe in a manned balloon.\n\nHe was married in 1947 to Marilyn June Hawley, who died in 2004. They had eight children.\n\n\u2014 Bloomberg News\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries", "description": "He made Hilton a force in Las Vegas gambling and also helped found the American Football League.", "authors": ["Stephen Miller"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LB4SY5G3YYI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
