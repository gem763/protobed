Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the Foreign Relations panel; Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence panel; and Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the Oversight Committee.\n\nHouse pursues new line of inquiry\n\nDemocrats say they want to move with alacrity in what they've called a pressing new phase of their investigations into Trump.\n\nTheir theory of the case is that Trump halted congressionally authorized military assistance for Ukraine until he got a commitment from its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, about a Biden investigation.\n\nThe White House released an account of Trump's conversation with Zelenskiy last week in which the American president asks for a \"favor\" and mentions the Bidens.\n\nAn anonymous whistleblower within the intelligence community alleged in a complaint that the Ukrainians had been primed beforehand to expect that topic.\n\nWhat isn't clear is how that pre-call message might have been delivered or by whom. Members of Congress want to hear from Giuliani and others who worked on the Ukraine issue, including some State Department diplomats, about that part of the story.\n\nA number of witnesses may appear before the House Intelligence Committee this week behind closed doors.\n\nWhite House unmoved\n\nTrump and his Republican supporters dismiss the Democrats' threats of impeachment.\n\nThe president does not concede there was anything amiss in what he has called a \"perfect\" conversation with Zelenskiy, one that prompted Trump to praise his own niceness.\n\nRepublicans also have sought to go on offense against the process still churning within officialdom in Washington; Trump said on Monday he's trying to find out the whistleblower's identity, even though the person is supposed to be protected under the law.\n\nTrump's 2020 reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee also have said they're buying $10 million worth of cable TV ads to underscore what they say should be the real focus of the Ukraine affair: alleged \"corruption\" by Biden and his family.\n\nTrump also has defended what he called the propriety of broaching \"corruption\" with his Ukrainian counterpart, and said that he halted military assistance because he sought more contributions from European governments.", "description": "President Trump's lawyer has been ordered to give evidence to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence as its probe accelerates in the Ukraine affair.", "authors": ["Ryan Lucas"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/30/ap_19227774676472_wide-688891671f8b631a5d51c970c5703c890952aca9.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
