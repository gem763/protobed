The survey came after official figures showed India's economy grew at an annual rate of 5.0% last quarter, its slowest in more than six years and significantly weaker than 5.7% in a Reuters poll. Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index INPMI=ECI , compiled by IHS Markit, declined to 51.4 in August from July's 52.5, its weakest since May 2018. However, it has remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for more than two years.\n\nOn the other hand, data announced on Friday shows gross domestic product rose 5% in the June quarter from a year ago, the slowest pace in six years and lower than all the forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The weakness was broad-based, with consumption and export growth slowing while investment remained subdued.\n\nThe slump will put the onus on the Reserve Bank of India to continue cutting interest rates after 110 basis points of easing already this year, the economists said. The government -- which is sticking to its 7% growth projection for the fiscal year -- has in recent days announced a number of steps to improve India\u2019s longer-term growth, without providing any immediate support. It will merge state-run banks to help spur credit growth, ease foreign investment rules and give concessions on vehicle purchases.\n\nIndia is belatedly acknowledging that something has gone wrong with what was once billed as the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that New Delhi still doesn\u2019t have a cohesive strategy to reverse the slowdown. Finance Minister Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman did offer a stimulus package on Friday. The highlight was the rollback of a tax surcharge on overseas investors that she herself had imposed in July\u2019s budget. It\u2019s a welcome concession, though there is no logic in giving global banks a break on derivatives they trade in India while denying the same tax benefit to local hedge funds.\n\nFinally, I conclude that this gloomy picture of Indian economic scenario looks evident enough to keep the Indian equity market in long lasting slowdown; even before the global economy feels the punch of slowdown due to escalation of a tariff trade war between the U.S. and China. Let\u2019s see how the and will define, the impact of the plethora of punches \u2013 at national and international level; on September 3rd, 2019.
