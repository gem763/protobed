Analysts had forecast $18.2 billion. It marked the fifth consecutive quarter of shrinking sales at IBM, while analysts had been looking for signs that Red Hat, which was incorporated for the first time in these results, would change the narrative.\n\nIn July, IBM completed the purchase of the open-source software provider for $34 billion \u2013 sealing the world\u2019s second-largest technology deal. Adjusted revenue from Red Hat was $371 million in the third quarter, better than the $350 million IBM told investors it was expecting in August. Red Hat was folded into IBM\u2019s cloud and cognitive software unit, which pulled in $5.3 billion in revenue, up 6.4% from a year earlier.\n\nStill, IBM\u2019s overall sales declined due to divestitures from commerce software businesses, foreign currency effects and poor performance in one of its key units. Revenue from Global Technology Services, the company\u2019s infrastructure and tech support unit, fell 5.6% to $6.7 billion. Global Business Services revenue, which includes IBM\u2019s consulting arm, increased only 1% to $4.1 billion.\n\nThe shares fell 3.2% in extended trading. They had gained 25% this year through the close of trading Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe one thing IBM doesn\u2019t need is a disappointing quarter,\u201d Ian Campbell, CEO of Boston-based Nucleus Research, said in an interview before the results were released. \u201cThere have been so many quarters that have shown a downward trend in revenue. This quarter we need to see some change as IBM has fallen to the point where they have no name recognition.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is pegging IBM\u2019s future to a hybrid cloud strategy by using Red Hat to offer enhanced security services on private and multiple public clouds. IBM hopes this new plan will allow it to partner with top cloud rivals like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Azure, rather than being left behind in a trillion-dollar market where it\u2019s been seeking growth for a decade.\n\nAnalysts and investors might have to wait a little longer to see any real uptick in revenue growth from Red Hat. Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said in an interview that IBM will be back to a sustained level of revenue growth in 2020.\n\nEarnings excluding some costs were $2.68 a share, largely in line with the average analyst projection of $2.67. IBM reiterated it sees full-year adjusted operating profit of $12.80 a share.\n\n(Updates with forecast for full-year operating profit in final paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. reported third-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street estimates, with the long-awaited revenue infusion from Red Hat failing to compensate for continued declines in other parts of its business.Total revenue was $18 billion in the three months ended", "authors": ["Olivia Carville"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/d_wBaBk2OPpu3wRFTXHwdw--~B/aD0xMzMyO3c9MjAwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/ffdb0f14e7d4d9c8a2171f89045e6b58", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
