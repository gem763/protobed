It\u2019s beautiful and rather grand, unlike the song, which is beautiful but much more understated. Over gently swaying acoustic guitar, Alicia and Miguel coo sweet nothings to each other in a gorgeous, timeless melody, the kind of thing that sounds improvised by Keys just sitting at the piano and playing. This relaxed, unforced mood hopefully suffuses her incoming seventh album. BBT\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest What about her dreams? \u2026 Angel Olsen.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of another contemporary singer who time-travels as convincingly as Angel Olsen. Her debut sounded as though it had been recorded by lamplight in a poorly insulated shack; later records reinvigorated classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll and weepies worthy of Roy Orbison. On Lark, she harnesses high romanticism, the lux drama of classic Hollywood. It\u2019s a hard sound to land without veering into pastiche, let alone to hold one\u2019s own amid the heavy arrangements. But Olsen commands the scene. She teases out the details of a relationship that crumbled into the void of disconnection, the soft production accruing a potent charge. Then the tension snaps: \u201cWhat about my dreams?\u201d she howls, addressing a former lover who failed to see her for who she truly was. As the strings go off like a fireworks display comprised entirely of screamer rockets, the blinkered sod is left in no uncertain terms about the magnitude of her desires. LS\n\nThe rap breakthrough of the year award has to go to DaBaby, who has just released Kirk, his second album of 2019 following the excellent Baby on Baby. The first album was mostly fixated on guns, wealth and \u2013 as track titles such as Carpet Burn and Baby Sitter allude \u2013 shagging. But Intro announces that Kirk is rather more soul-searching. With his HD alpha-male delivery, DaBaby tells of his pre-fame poverty, and the pain of his father dying at the same time that he finally became successful. It prompts a reflection on the enduring power of family and friendship even through the complicating factors of newfound fame and wealth. BBT\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest None more emo \u2026 Touch\u00e9 Amor\u00e9. Photograph: Christian Cordon\n\nThis LA post-hardcore five-piece aren\u2019t so much in touch with their feelings as sending them a constant stream of extremely earnest WhatsApps. A decade into their career, they follow their recently rerecorded debut with this first track from their forthcoming new album, and the lyrics from frontman Jeremy Bolm are almost self-parodic in their emo-ness: \u201cA last responder to my own self interest \u2026 Cold-shouldered by design,\u201d he laments. \u201cI\u2019m a secondhand piano / Incapable of tune / Providing the score / For gone too soon.\u201d But boy, does he sell them \u2013 the chorus would be anthemic sung by anyone, but is made gloriously so by Bolm\u2019s acute feeling. BBT\n\nIt\u2019s tough to pick a standout from Brittany Howard\u2019s remarkable debut solo album, Jaime. But even on this intimate, exposing record, Goat Head cuts deeper than everything else. It\u2019s a break from the album\u2019s diffuse blues, hooked instead around a lilting piano loop. Howard layers it as she assembles her child\u2019s-eye understanding of colour: first learning red from green, the way your parents teach you. Then, starker differences: having a white mother and a black father in a southern town, and how that prompted a hate crime; slashed tyres, a goat\u2019s head on the back seat. The stumbling joins in the looped piano become fissures as the younger Howard becomes painfully cognisant of the world\u2019s gaping inconsistencies; more unsettling is how Howard and her backing vocalists turn \u201cgoat head in the back\u201d into a sensual, soothing refrain. LS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bittersweet beauty \u2026 Mary Lattimore. Photograph: Rachael Pony Cassells\n\nLeft over from the recording of her 2018 album Hundreds of Days, Quintana finds harpist Mary Lattimore at her most expansive and melancholy. Her glassy playing is subsumed by static fog, which, across 15 eventful minutes, swells and eddies, blurring the precision of her playing and building to an unexpected bass note that hits like a cataclysmic omen. The track also calls to mind the imposing tundras of Canadian drone composer Tim Hecker\u2019s defining Ravedeath, 1972. Given that it\u2019s an outtake from an album with which it has little in common, it\u2019s hard to tell whether it indicates a new creative horizon or an abandoned idea for Lattimore. Either way, its bittersweet beauty and lingering sense of doom feels arrestingly contemporary for this moment in the climate crisis. LS\n\nAlthough he was recently and no doubt mendaciously mistaken for Beto O\u2019Rourke by right-wing trolls, (Sandy) Alex G could never actually mount a credible Democratic candidacy campaign \u2013 he\u2019s so horizontally chill you can barely imagine him mounting his stairs most days. But that demeanour has made the singer-songwriter \u2013 and Frank Ocean\u2019s sometime guitarist \u2013 one of the best of his generation, with songs that rarely resolve in the way you expect them to. Southern Sky, from excellent new album House of Sugar, is the perfect entry point to his catalogue, with its Beach Boys-style naivety to the vocals and the playground-chant melody in the outro. BBT\n\nTexas-based French pop auteur Lou Rebecca trades in fantasy: she makes dreamy lounge pop that\u2019s as featherlight as a pink macaron, her sexy-baby vocals in debt to countrywoman Brigitte Bardot. (It\u2019s been a good year for it. See also: Swiss singer Vendredi sur Mer\u2019s debut, Premiers Emois.) But the fantasy is all hers. On Desire, she beseeches a lover to get closer, tell her everything, says she\u2019ll be anything they want. But her plan, it turns out, is more Villanelle than Valentine: \u201cJe plante mes crocs dans ta chair,\u201d she coos \u2013 I\u2019ll sink my fangs into your flesh \u2013 taking revenge against men who treat women like wish-fulfilment machines. They should have seen it coming: the insouciant yet relentless disco beat speaks to a strategic mind hard at work behind the deceptively sugary facade. LS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hot property \u2026 James Massiah.\n\nSet in an equatorial city, the gripping video for south London poet/rapper James Massiah\u2019s debut single depicts people struggling to go about their everyday business in apocalyptic heat \u2013 so hot that an egg frying on the pavement becomes an omen for their fate. The track is as cool as the clip is sweltering: Massiah connects the threads from eski to dancehall and the slower end of acid house, unspooling a nonchalant devotional amid a cocky bassline and glacial, ravey synths that sparkle enticingly. LS\n\nJapanese ambient is the latest frontier in reissue culture: following the Kanky\u014d Ongaku compilation earlier this year, and albums by Yutaka Hirose, Midori Takada, Takashi Kukobo and Hiroshi Yoshimura all recently returning to circulation, next up is Toshifumi Hinata, whose best bits have been collected as the album Broken Belief this month by the Music from Memory label. There are big synth-y fantasias, drifting chordscapes and pristine piano notes, but the best moments are the more fleshed-out rhythm tracks. Atarashii Yuhbokumin has a bossa nova energy to its drum machine pulse, creating a sensual space for its affecting central piano melody and jazzy bass solo.
