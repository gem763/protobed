The connection with Mery was immediate, as it was with her mother and Rafa\u2019s mother and sister. They\u2019re an extraordinary family and it has been a pleasure to work with them.\u201d\n\nClara also created dresses for for Perello\u2019s mother on the big day, as well as Nadal\u2019s mother and sister.
