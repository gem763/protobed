The blast was powerful enough to damage two of its reservoirs, leading to an oil spill in the area.\n\nLocal media cited some unnamed Iranian \u201ctechnical experts\u201d believe that the incident could have been caused by a \u201cterrorist attack,\u201d but didn\u2019t provide any evidence backing the claim.\n\nThe tanker\u2019s crew wasn\u2019t hurt in the incident that took place near Jeddah, the largest port in the Red Sea that serves as a maritime gateway to Saudi Arabia.\n\nNIOC, which once ranked second after Saudi Aramco in terms of crude oil extraction, has yet to confirm the media reports. Overseen by Iran\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum, the company is exclusively responsible for the Islamic Republic\u2019s oil and gas exploration.\n\nDETAILS TO FOLLOW", "description": "A tanker belonging to Iran\u2019s government-owned oil corporation has reportedly been hit by a blast and caught fire in the Red Sea, 60 miles from Saudi Arabian shores.
