And could you blame them?\n\nAfter 2018\u2019s brutal bear market collapse, traders were thirsty to see green in their portfolios, even craving said green like a drug. So funnily enough, the strong move higher in the Bitcoin price observed from April to June was exactly what they needed.\n\nHowever, this ended late that month when the cryptocurrency topped out at $14,000 and proceeded to collapse. Since then, Bitcoin has entered a drawn-out lull, with there being a clearly tightening trade range that has resulted in Bitcoin\u2019s realized volatility falling into a range that precedes gargantuan moves.\n\nBitcoin realized volatility back at year lows \u2013 moved on average 1.2% over the last ten days pic.twitter.com/3tFqBsbHNB \u2014 skew (@skew_markets) September 19, 2019\n\nNot only is volatility decreasing but so are volumes. Skew pointed out that CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures saw their lowest volumes in four months, implying indirection in this market.\n\nCME this week \u2013 lowest volumes in 4 months pic.twitter.com/wgtfJqCbhC \u2014 skew (@skew_markets) September 19, 2019\n\nThis declining volume in the CME Bitcoin futures market has been echoed over in the spot market.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency exchanges in aggregate have processed $51 billion worth of trades over the past 24 hours, which is a far cry from the $120+ billion seen during late-June and early-July of this very year. Sure, the data site is known not to be 100% accurate, but the decline in registered crypto volume accentuates the consolidatory period that Bitcoin is in.\n\nA big move is clearly coming, by simply logic of market consolidation. But in which direction will Bitcoin head next?\n\nBitcoin Price to Resolve Higher, Analysts Say\n\nAnalysts are currently leaning for an upward breakout due to a number of factors.\n\nAnalyst Crypto Welson noted that Bitcoin is currently testing the bottom band of a long-term channel on BTC\u2019s logarithmic chart that stretches back at least three years. In 2016/2017\u2019s macro bull trend, BTC bounced off the lower band of this channel on multiple occasions, never breaking under it. The cryptocurrency is likely to bounce if historical price action is of any current relevance.\n\n#Bitcoin's logarithmic charts show that we're currently at support. Each chance we're below 10K is a great buying opportunity for everyone looking to ride the next pump to new yearly highs this October! October is very bullish.

In a poll conducted by prominent analyst Josh Rager, which surveyed some 5,000 Crypto Twitter users, a majority believe that Bitcoin\u2019s descending triangle consolidation pattern will end with BTC entering another uptrend.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "In June, Bitcoin (BTC) had hit its stride once again, seeing +5% days on top of +5% days.
