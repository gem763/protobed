His minister of justice repeatedly called the bill \"unacceptable\" and alluded to \"next steps\" once it became law.\n\n\"Unthinkable\": Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh condemn Quebec's secularism bill, which, among other measures, would ban many public workers from wearing religious garb or symbols<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hx9giAYwFz\">pic.twitter.com/hx9giAYwFz</a> \u2014@CBCPolitics\n\nOne should not doubt Trudeau's inherent repulsion for the Quebec law and everything it embodies. This is the man who heralded a woman's right to wear a niqab \u2014 the starkest symbol of oppression of women \u2014 to a citizenship ceremony at which she would pledge to adhere to a Constitution that specifically defends gender equality.\n\nTrudeau the father only paid lip service to multiculturalism and the veneration of differences. Trudeau the son embodies it in his bones. It is certain that, if re-elected, he will act. How? More on this later.\n\nBut the bill became law in late June, and no action has been taken since. On the contrary, the Liberal government has evaded and procrastinated on the issue. Why?\n\nThere is an inconvenient bump on the road to squashing the Quebec law: public opinion. Quebec public opinion, certainly, but Canadian public opinion also. It can \u2014 and will \u2014 no doubt be disregarded the morning after the election, but not the mornings before.\n\nBan has support outside Quebec\n\nIn April, L\u00e9ger Marketing carried out a country-wide online poll asking if voters would support the ban of religious symbols for teachers, police officers and judges in their province. The poll also asked respondents who they would vote for in the federal election.\n\nOutside Quebec, fully 40 per cent of Canadians approved of such a ban in their own province. Except in Alberta, 50 per cent or more of Conservative voters were in favour.\n\nCase closed.\n\nProblem is, a sizable chunk of Liberal voters also embraced the ban. Here are the numbers: Atlantic Canada, 28 per cent; Alberta, 31 per cent; Ontario, 32 per cent; B.C., 34 per cent; Prairies (Manitoba and Saskatchewan), 62 per cent. (Would you believe that the numbers are even higher for NDP voters!)\n\nConservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer speaks to the Montreal chamber of commerce last week. Other than in the province of Alberta, 50 per cent or more of Conservative voters said they support a religious symbols ban like the one instituted in Quebec, according to a L\u00e9ger Marketing poll. (Peter McCabe/The Canadian Press)\n\nLiberal pollsters have seen these or similar numbers. And they know that 50 per cent of their Quebec voters support the ban, according to the L\u00e9ger poll. Were they to make this one of the pivotal issues of the campaign, they would have to turn their backs on a third of their base \u2014 and give up any chance of forming a majority.\n\nTough luck.\n\nAn election is precisely the moment when truths must be told.\n\nIf Trudeau really thinks the ban is \"unthinkable,\" and I'm sure he does, he must tell voters exactly what he plans to do about it if re-elected.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized the ban in the past but has refrained from publicly commenting on it during his recent visit to Quebec this summer. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press)\n\nTrudeau should reveal what he plans to do about the ban\n\nThree options are available to him. The most extreme, let's call it the nuclear option, is to use the old disallowance clause of the Constitution to simply squash the legislation. This option, promoted by pundits such as columnist Andrew Coyne, was last used in 1943 against an Alberta law that restricted the property rights of Hutterite colonies.\n\nThere is a deadline on that option: it can only be used within 12 months of the law being sanctioned by the governor general, thus, no later than late June 2020.\n\nSome in Quebec have opposed the ban, but the Leger survey suggested that the majority of Quebecers support it. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe mid-range option is to refer the question of whether or not the law is constitutional directly to the Supreme Court. Constitutional scholars meeting in Toronto last April concluded that recent jurisprudence would lead the court to declare the law invalid \u2014 on its merits and despite the use of the notwithstanding clause. They said the court could also severely curtail the use of the notwithstanding clause itself and declare that Quebec really had no right to use it pre-emptively.\n\nThe milder option would be for Ottawa to join the ongoing legal challenge of the ban by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and National Council of Canadian Muslims and help bring it before the Supreme Court.\n\nAre any of these options off the table for Trudeau? The election campaign should not end without a clear answer to that question.\n\nLook to Europe, not Ottawa\n\nThose who think Canadian multiculturalism is the only possible answer to the challenges of diverse societies will keep pushing hard against the ban. As did CBC's Robyn Urback, who wrote recently that the Quebec law was a \"national disgrace,\" nothing short of \"state-sponsored, systemic oppression\" and called on Trudeau to denounce it as he had other \"policy wrongs of the past,\" such as the hanging of First Nations chiefs in the 19th century.\n\nProponents of this point of view are also present in the NDP \u2014 and to a lesser extent in the Conservative Party \u2014 and will want to know why their leaders seem indifferent in the face of Quebec's perceived assault on equality rights.\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault, right, during the vote on his secularism legislation in Quebec's National Assembly on June 16, 2019. Legault invoked the notwithstanding clause when passing the Bill 21 in an attempt to head off any constitutional challenges of the law. (Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press)\n\nQuebecers, on the other hand, know that the cradle of rights and freedoms is not in Ottawa but Europe. And that European courts have ruled that states have legitimate grounds to demand a clear separation of Church and state \u2014 including when it comes to the attire of civil servants \u2014 and to promote the rights of women by prohibiting misogynist religious garb.\n\nSo the question is, really, about tolerance. Will the Liberals and other federal parties tolerate the existence within Canada of a nation that disagrees with their brand of multiculturalism?\n\nTrudeau claims he accepts the existence of Quebec as a nation within Canada. Will he say that doesn't mean a thing when that nation veers from the Canadian norm?\n\nHe knows that no Quebec government to date has signed the current Constitution, and each one has rejected multiculturalism as a policy. Will he nonetheless use this unsigned Constitution as a hammer against a very popular Quebec law?\n\nThe Quebec government of Fran\u00e7ois Legault played by the rules when it passed the law in June by invoking the notwithstanding clause to forestall any potential charter challenge. Will Ottawa now ask the Supreme Court to change the rules once the game is already underway?\n\nQuebecers want to know; Canadians, too.", "description": "Quebec's secularism law should definitely be an issue in the federal election campaign, writes former Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e.
