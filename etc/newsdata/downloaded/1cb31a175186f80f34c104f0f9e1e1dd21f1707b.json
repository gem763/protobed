His upbringing had been characterised by dysfunction, chaos, filth, squalor, isolation and neglect,' read their application, obtained by the Herald Sun.\n\n'Those considerations in combination rendered a sentence of life imprisonment particularly severe, more severe than that disposition would already be but for their presence.'\n\nThey said it was 'unreasonable' for Justice Stephen Kaye to sentence Todd to life with no chance of parole until after serving 35 years behind bars.\n\nJustice Kaye ignored submissions by prosecutors against a life term. Todd's defence team said while the judge wasn't obligated to, 'he ought to have'.\n\n'A sentence other than life imprisonment was open \u2014 and by virtue of the principle of parsimony, thus required \u2014 to be imposed,' they argued.\n\nTodd stalked 22-year-old Ms Dixon for more than an hour as she walked through Princes Park after a comedy gig on June 12 last year.\n\nAfter the murder, the then-19-year-old bought a pie and coffee, went back to the Carlton North crime scene and googled rape and pornography as well as stories about his victim.\n\nHe was diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder while in custody.\n\nBefore the murder, Todd fantasised about violent non-consensual sex culminating in a woman's death.\n\nDuring the sentencing, Justice Stephen Kaye said Todd's 'dark and sick fantasy' and the disorder drove the crime and not his mild autism.\n\nTodd pleaded guilty to rape, murder, attempted rape and sexual assault.", "description": "Jaymes Todd, 20, is fighting for a lesser sentence in the Court of Appeal after killing Ms Dixon in Melbourne in June 28.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/11/19358830-0-image-a-12_1570358643363.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
