(Photo: Dyson)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new vacuum, there's one brand that should be a serious contender for your next purchase, and that's Dyson. Over the years, they've consistently outperformed other brands throughout our appliance testing, with their vacuums in particular being well-received for their powerful suction and ease of use. The one downside to Dyson products is usually their high price tag, but today, thanks to a one-day sale at Home Depot, two of their popular vacuums are actually pretty affordable.\n\nRight now for Home Depot's Special Buy of the Day, you can get both the Dyson V8 Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum and the Dyson Ball Total Clean Vacuum for seriously low prices. These all come highly rated, so this is the sale to shop for those of you who want a well-made vacuum that's built to last.\n\nTake the V8 Absolute, for instance, which is one of the best cordless vacuums we've ever tested. It would normally cost you around $400, but with this sale you can get it for $329. It's lightweight (only 5.6 lbs.), slim enough to clean those hard-to-reach areas, and can run for up to 40 minutes on a single charge, not to mention the fact that it picked up 88 percent of the dirt in our tests.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dyson Ball Total Clean offers powerful suction and can easily navigate around furniture thanks to its built-in ball design, and comes with a bunch of extra tools to help you get the deepest clean possible on every surface. This one would normally cost you around $355, but you can get it for $100 off during this sale.\n\nSeeing as how both these vacuums normally retail for upwards of $350, we definitely recommend you check out this sale ASAP if you want a new vacuum to keep your floors tidy. Psst, in case you've been eyeing a new air purifier, Dyson's Pure Cool Link Air Purifier is also included in this sale, for almost $80 off its usual price.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
