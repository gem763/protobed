I know I can run faster,\u201d Bekele said. Bekele missed out on the then-world record by six seconds when he won the 2016 Berlin Marathon in 2:03:03, then a personal best.\n\nOlympic champion Kipchoge, who ran the current record of 2:01:39 in the German capital last year, skipped Sunday\u2019s race to focus on his attempt to become the first to break the two-hour mark at a specially organized event in Austria in October.\n\nBekele had knee and hamstring injuries in recent years and hadn\u2019t completed a marathon since April last year, leading many to believe his best days were over. His world records over 5,000m and 10,000m are from 2004 and 2005, respectively. \u201cI have shown that my career is far from over,\u201d Bekele said.\n\n\n\nAshete Bekere of Ethiopia won a sprint against compatriot Mare Dibaba to clinch the women\u2019s marathon in 2:20:14, a personal best. Dibaba finished seven seconds behind. Kenya\u2019s Selly Chepyego Kaptich was third in 2:21:06, and Ethiopia\u2019s Helen Tola finished fourth in 2:21:36. The four had shared the lead for a long time.\n\nThe 31-year-old Bekere, who previously won marathons in Rotterdam and Valencia, said she believes she can run under two hours and 20 minutes on the fast course.", "description": "Kenenisa Bekele missed out on the world record by just two seconds as he completed a remarkable comeback to win the Berlin Marathon", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3daf5741b256461f4989bc9923aab06139607f7e/0_526_3528_2118/master/3528.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=19364a300e3bc51560b79a30fa3e6ef5", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
