The trio were accused negligence for failing to implement safety measures, all three pleaded not guilty. Tsunehisa Katsumata, Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro argued they could not have reasonably foreseen the disaster and thus were not responsible for its effects, including the premature deaths of 44 hospital patients linked to the emergency evacuation.\n\nJapanese prosecutors had previously refused to charge the men, and only took up the case after a concerted legal effort by the families of the dead and those who were evacuated from the area around Fukushima.\n\nThe cleanup from the disaster -- caused when an earthquake-triggered tsunami struck the plant -- is expected to take decades, and cost billions of dollars. Tens of thousands of people still remain displaced, eight years after the original meltdown.", "description": "The only criminal prosecution stemming from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster has ended in not guilty verdicts, in a blow to families displaced by the meltdown, as the fallout promises to haunt northern Japan for decades to come.", "authors": ["James Griffiths"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919110353-fukushima-file-reactor-building-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
