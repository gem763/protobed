In April 2019, the Columbia Journalism Review said, 'For some time now, by far the best daily reporting on climate change has come from the Guardian, which covers the science, politics, economics, and health aspects throughout the world with great force and clarity.' We will prioritise and give prominence to environmental journalism from The Guardian and Observer, bringing you the news and information you need. Our reporting on the environment, from our international team, will never be influenced by commercial or political interests and will always be rooted in scientific fact.\n\nWe will report on how environmental collapse is already affecting people around the world, including during natural disasters and extreme weather events. We will bring you the world\u2019s leading voices on the climate crisis, and we will cover issues across food, travel and lifestyle in order to help readers live sustainably. We will undertake investigations into the economic and political structures that underpin the carbon economy, and examine the role the climate crisis plays in many other critical issues - including inequality, migration and the battle over scarce resources.\n\nWe will use language that recognises the severity of the crisis we\u2019re in. In May 2019, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world, using \u201cclimate emergency, crisis or breakdown\u201d and \u201cglobal heating\u201d instead of \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d. We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on the urgency of this issue.\n\nThe Guardian will achieve net zero emissions by 2030.. We are developing a detailed plan for how to achieve this, involving a full audit of our emissions. Our priority will be to reduce our carbon footprint meaningfully and permanently.\n\nWe will be transparent with our progress. We have announced today that we have become the first news organisation to acquire BCorp certification, which means joining a community of businesses from across the globe who openly commit to driving positive societal change. This is an important milestone in public transparency and accountability for our global environmental footprint.\n\nEnvironmental journalism from the Guardian and the Observer has a powerful impact around the world and we have received financial support from readers in more than 180 countries. This support means we can keep Guardian journalism accessible to everyone. We hope you will consider supporting Guardian journalism today with a contribution or subscription \u2014 every form of support, however big or small, is so valuable for our future.\n\nSupport the Guardian\n\nContribute\n\nSubscribe", "description": "Today, we are making a public pledge to ourselves and our readers, that we are committed to taking responsibility for our role - both journalistically and institutionally - on how to impact the climate crisis we are facing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2be879486cdef47c849ba5c72ec3dc73", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
