Rights groups say hundreds of thousands have been detained in camps without trial, but China argues they voluntarily attend centres which combat \"extremism\". The BBC went inside one of them.\n\nI'd been to the camps before.\n\nBut the closest I'd managed to get on previous visits were snatched glimpses of the barbed wire and watchtowers from a passing car, while the plainclothes police officers tailing us tried to stop us getting any closer.\n\nNow I was being invited inside.\n\nThe risks of accepting were obvious. We were being taken into places that appeared to have been carefully spruced up - with satellite images revealing that much of the security infrastructure had recently been removed.\n\nAnd one by one the people we spoke to inside, some of them visibly nervous, told us similar stories.\n\nImage caption The highly secure camp building in Xinjiang\n\nAll of them members of Xinjiang's largest, mainly Muslim ethnic group - the Uighurs - they said they'd been \"infected by extremism\" and that they'd volunteered to have their \"thoughts transformed\".\n\nThis was China's narrative in the mouths of people selected for us, and for whom any cross-examination might pose a serious risk.\n\nWhat might be the consequences if they did let something slip? How could we safely separate the propaganda from the reality?\n\nRadicalised and reborn\n\nThere are plenty of precedents for this kind of reporting dilemma.\n\nThere was the heavily managed 2004 press tour of the US-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, in the wake of the abuse scandal, with reporters herded away from detainees clamouring to have their voices heard, some while waving their prosthetic legs.\n\nOr there's the example of the rare and restricted media access to Australia's offshore immigration detention centres.\n\nAnd in the 1930s and 1940s, Germany organised media trips to camps at Sonnenburg and Theresienstadt, designed to demonstrate how \"humane\" they were.\n\nIn all such cases, the reporter is witness to a story of vital global importance, but forced to try to tell it with only limited or highly controlled access to those most affected by it.\n\nIn Xinjiang though, there is one big difference. The authorities grant access not only to show that the conditions inside the facilities are good, they also want to prove that they are not prisons at all.\n\nWe were shown adults seated in rows at school desks in brightly lit classrooms, chanting in unison while learning Chinese.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC visits the camps where China\u2019s Muslims have their \"thoughts transformed\"\n\nImage caption Rows of adults are seen studying inside classrooms\n\nSome performed highly staged and choreographed music and dance routines for us, wearing traditional ethnic costumes, whirling around their desks, smiles fixed in place.\n\nImage caption Others perform to choreographed tunes\n\nAnd what was quite clear was that the Chinese officials accompanying us believed wholeheartedly in the narrative on display, some almost moved to tears as they looked on.\n\nThese people, we were urged to recognise, were reborn. Once dangerously radicalised and full of hatred for the Chinese government, they were now safely back on the road to reform thanks to the timely, benevolent intervention of that same government.\n\nThe West could learn a lot from this was the message.\n\nReferring to the date the re-education policy began, one senior official looked me sternly in the eye.\n\n\"There has not been a single terror attack in Xinjiang in 32 months,\" he said. \"This is our patriotic duty.\"\n\n'Oh my heart don't break'\n\nBut in accepting the access, our job was to try to peer beneath the official messaging and hold it up to as much scrutiny as we could.\n\nThere were the bits of graffiti we filmed, written in Uighur, that we later had translated.\n\n\"Oh my heart don't break,\" read one. Another in Chinese said simply: \"Step by step.\"\n\nImage caption All men at the camp wear a blue tracksuit \"uniform\"\n\nThere were the answers, in extended interviews with the officials, that revealed much about the nature of the system.\n\nThose in it were \"almost criminals,\" they said, viewed as a threat not because they'd committed a crime, but because they might have the potential to do so.\n\nAnd there was the admission that, once identified as having extremist tendencies, they were given a choice - but not much of one.\n\nThe option was \"of choosing between a judicial hearing or education in the de-extremification facilities\".\n\n\"Most people choose to study,\" we were told. Little wonder, given the odds of a fair trial.\n\nAnd we know, from other sources, that the definition of extremism is now drawn very widely indeed - having a long beard for example, or simply contacting relatives overseas.\n\nWe saw the dormitories in which these \"extremists\" slept, up to 10 per room, in bunk beds and with a toilet at one end, shielded with only a thin sheet of fabric.\n\nImage caption A bathroom inside a female dormitory\n\nImage caption One dormitory can sleep up to 10 people\n\nAnd then there was the cautious questioning that revealed much, not in what they could say, but what they couldn't.\n\nI asked one man, who'd been there for eight months already, how many people he'd seen \"graduate\" in that time.\n\nThere was a slight pause before he answered. \"About that, I have no idea,\" he said.\n\nImage caption A heart-shaped sticker of China's flag can be seen pasted on a locker\n\nJust one voice from within a giant system of mass internment thought to hold more than a million people on the basis of their ethnicity and their faith.\n\nHowever faint and muted, we should listen carefully to what such voices might be telling us.", "description": "China is accused of locking up Uighurs in camps - which it denies.
