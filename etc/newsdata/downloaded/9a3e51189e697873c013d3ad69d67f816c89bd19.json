(Carson King)\n\nOn Sept. 14, an Iowa man named Carson King went viral after holding a sign on ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d asking for donations on Venmo to pay for his \u201cBusch Light Supply.\u201d When cash unexpectedly poured in, King decided to give it to a local children\u2019s hospital instead of buying beer, leading Venmo and Anheuser-Busch to pledge matching donations.\n\nThat\u2019s when Des Moines Register reporter Aaron Calvin set out to profile King \u2014 and found two offensive tweets the 24-year-old had sent when he was 16.\n\nThat discovery has now sparked an acrimonious conflict, as King quickly lost his partnership with Anheuser-Busch, and the Des Moines Register scrambled to explain its decision to report on the old tweets in the first place \u2014 particularly after critics Tuesday turned up multiple offensive tweets once sent by Calvin, forcing the paper to open a new investigation into its own reporter.\n\n\u201cSome of the toughest decisions in journalism are about what to publish \u2060 \u2014 or not,\u201d Des Moines Register executive editor Carol Hunter wrote in a Tuesday statement defending the paper\u2019s choice to report on King\u2019s old posts, adding that \u201csuch decisions are not made lightly and are rooted in what we perceive as the public good.\u201d\n\nThe story marks the latest battle over \u201ccancel culture,\u201d the same debate over how to handle offensive statements that roiled the comedy world earlier this month when \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d fired a new featured player over racist language he\u2019d used about Asian people on a podcast.\n\nKing\u2019s social media missteps came to light after Calvin, a trending news reporter at the Register, delved far back into the casino security guard\u2019s old tweets. Calvin discovered two 2012 tweets, written when King was in high school, that the Register described as \u201cracist jokes, one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the holocaust.\u201d When Calvin asked King about the tweets, he told the reporter seeing them made him feel \u201csick.\u201d\n\nBefore the Register published its profile online, though, King held a news conference on Tuesday evening to apologize for the posts and to announce that Anheuser-Busch had ended its partnership with him. The beermaker still promised to donate the more than $350,000 it had already pledged to the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics.\n\n[A \u2018College GameDay\u2019 sign asked for beer money. It\u2019s raised nearly $1 million for a children\u2019s hospital fundraiser.]\n\nKing explained that the tweets had been jokes among friends watching Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cTosh.0\u201d and that he didn\u2019t remember them until Calvin dug them up.\n\n\u201cOnce he pointed it out and I went back and looked at it I was really upset with myself,\u201d King said on Twitter, adding that he did not blame the newspaper, which he said had been \u201cnothing but kind in all of their coverage.\u201d\n\nBut online, backlash to the Register\u2019s reporting began brewing immediately.\n\nCritics questioned why Calvin had dug so far into the past of a previously ordinary person who wasn\u2019t directly profiting from his newfound, accidental fame. Conservative bloggers latched on to the incident as an example of alleged hypocrisy of reporters tarring people\u2019s reputations based on long-ago poor decisions.\n\nMany balked when Anheuser-Busch announced Tuesday afternoon that the company had cut ties with King, saying his posts \u201cdo not align with our values as a brand or as a company.\u201d\n\nAround 9:30 p.m., the Register published the profile, which mentions King\u2019s offensive tweets deep in the story.\n\nAs a clamor grew against that decision, the newspaper\u2019s executive editor published a letter on Twitter shortly before midnight, explaining in detail the editors\u2019 deliberations and why they decided to include the tweets. She said that staff heavily debated whether to write about King\u2019s two offensive tweets.\n\n\u201cThe jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts. Shouldn\u2019t that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King\u2019s cause or were planning to do so?\u201d Hunter wrote. \u201cThe counter arguments: The tweets were posted seven years ago, when King was 16. And he was remorseful. Should we chalk up the posts to a youthful mistake and omit the information?\u201d\n\nThe paper\u2019s editors landed on a compromise, Hunter said: Publishing the information, but not making it a major focus of the story.\n\n\u201cEventually, Register editors decided we would include the information, but at the bottom of the story,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we should be transparent about what we had found, but not highlight it at the top of the story or as a separate story.\u201d\n\nThe statement did little to quell the anger bubbling on Twitter. And that fury intensified as critics began digging through Calvin\u2019s old tweets \u2014 and soon found several that appeared to be at least as problematic as King\u2019s two racist jokes riffing off a 2012 comedy show.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, Calvin published tweets that used a racist slur for black people, made light of abusing women, used the word \u201cgay\u201d as a pejorative and mocked the legalization of same-sex marriage by saying he was \u201ctotally going to marry a horse.\u201d The Register\u2019s statement on Twitter was soon flooded with images of the reporter\u2019s offensive comments.\n\nBy late Tuesday night, Calvin began deleting old tweets, and then locked his account early Wednesday morning after posting an apology.\n\n\n\nDes Moines Register reporter Aaron Calvin deleted \u201cinappropriate or insensitive\u201d tweets after a controversy erupted over his profile of viral Internet star Carson King. (Twitter)\n\n\u201cHey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI apologize for not holding myself to the same high standards as the Register holds others.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment early Wednesday morning, Hunter said the Register was aware of the posts, but declined to comment further on Calvin\u2019s old tweets beyond noting the investigation.", "description": "Carson King's thirst for beer made him a national hero.
