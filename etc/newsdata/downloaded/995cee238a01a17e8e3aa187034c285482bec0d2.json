On that most basic level, Ryan Giggs\u2019 side got what they came for in Slovakia, courtesy of an unlikely goalscoring hero and an inexperienced defensive pairing which remained firm under second-half pressure.\n\nAfter three consecutive away defeats, there were positives for Wales to take from this draw in Trnava. There will also be some regret at their inability to turn one point into three on an enjoyably open evening where both teams might have felt worthy of a win.\n\nFor Wales, the solitary point puts greater onus on this weekend\u2019s meeting with Croatia, the leaders of this European Championship qualifying group. The might of the Cardiff atmosphere will be needed and so, remarkably, will the might of Kieffer Moore, the giant Wales striker who has emerged from nowhere to suddenly become a unique threat for his national side.\n\nAt 27, the Wigan forward has had to wait for his chance in the international game. When he was trundling around the lower leagues, he would never have thought it would come. Yet here he was, leading the Welsh line on his second international appearance, flanked by Real Madrid and Manchester United forwards, and scoring the opening goal. If Juraj Kucka had not struck a fine equaliser for the hosts, it could have been an even sweeter night for him and his manager.", "description": "If not a must-win, this was at least a must-not-lose for Wales.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212636845-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRo0U4xU-30oDveS4pXV-VuyvIW1ftwrJfbuf-MzLyHo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
