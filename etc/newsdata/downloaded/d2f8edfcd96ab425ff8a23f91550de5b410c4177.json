Instead, Trump will address a meeting about the persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians, an issue that resonates with Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters.\n\nThe Republican president arrived in New York on Sunday against a backdrop of swirling international tensions, including questions about his relationship with Ukraine, the uncertain future of Brexit, the U.S. trade war with China, stalled nuclear negotiations with North Korea and a weakening global economy.\n\nThe most immediate challenge may be Iran.\n\nTrump will try to convince skeptical global capitals to help build a coalition to confront Tehran after the United States blamed it for last week\u2019s strike at an oil field in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cWell, I always like a coalition,\u201d Trump said Friday, before going on to complain that under the old Iran nuclear deal, \u201ceveryone else is making money and we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s fulfillment of a campaign promise to exit the Iran nuclear deal has had wide ripple effects, leading Tehran to bolster its nuclear capabilities and dismaying European capitals who worked to establish the original agreement.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in particular, has been trying to lead Trump back to a deal and has suggested that the U.S. president meet with Iranian leader Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. meetings.\n\nTrump said Sunday that while \u201cnothing is ever off the table completely\u201d he had no intention of meeting with Rouhani.\n\nTensions between Washington and Tehran spiked after a Saudi Arabia oil field was partially destroyed in an attack that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed on Iran and deemed \u201can act of war.\u201d\n\nNow Trump will try to enlist wary world leaders in a collective effort to contain Iran.\n\n\u201cHe needs to win over traditional allies to do what traditional allies do, to band together against common threats,\u201d said Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe attacks last weekend in Saudi Arabia are precisely the kind of thing that the U.N. was intended to address, to create rules for international behavior and opportunities for collective action.\u201d\n\nUkraine also looms large on Trump\u2019s schedule. Even one week ago, a one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would have been seen largely as an afterthought.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s meeting on Wednesday with Zelenskiy will come just days after revelations that the president urged his Ukrainian counterpart in a July phone call to investigate the activities of the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump said he was concerned about corruption; Democrats frame his actions as an effort to pressure Zelenskiy to dig up damaging material on a potential 2020 rival.\n\nThat pressure is the subject of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that the administration has refused to turn over to members of Congress, setting up a showdown with Democrats.\n\nTrump is defending himself against the intelligence official\u2019s complaint, asserting that it comes from a \u201cpartisan whistleblower,\u201d though the president also said he doesn\u2019t know the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nHe insisted Sunday his conversation with Zelenskiy was \u201cabsolutely perfect.\u201d But Democrats believe it shows that Trump is emboldened to seek foreign help for his reelection effort.\n\nThere are plenty of other concerns in the mix during Trump\u2019s U.N. visit, including the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nBut China\u2019s Xi Jinping is not expected to attend, nor are several other prominent world leaders, including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAmong the nations whose leaders Trump plans to meet in New York: Iraq, Poland, Egypt, Pakistan, South Korea and Japan. He will also meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, clinging to power after failed attempts to steer his nation out of the European Union.\n\nTrump\u2019s annual address to the General Assembly is scheduled for Tuesday. Two years ago, he used the moment to deride North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and threaten to destroy North Korea.\n\nA year ago, he drew laughter when he used his speech to recite his administration\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nHis theme this year, according to aides, will be to reassert America\u2019s determination to uphold its sovereignty and independence, especially on issues of national security.\n\nBut others may push a different path.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an attempt to push back against the unilateralism, against the isolationism, against the populism that has affected not only the United States but other countries as well,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman of the Brookings Institution. \u201cI don\u2019t know how effective this will be, but it\u2019s an example of how some of our traditional allies are organizing themselves in response to the feeling that the United States, the U.K., that other sort of major engines in the U.N. system no longer are pressing the accelerator.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "description": "A centerpiece of this year's U.N. schedule will be a Monday session on climate change that Trump plans to skip.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88af872100005d00da4388.jpeg?cache=tfnmjfja4p&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
