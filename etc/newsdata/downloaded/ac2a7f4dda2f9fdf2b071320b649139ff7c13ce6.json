Sharyl Attkisson points out 1 very DAMNING fact for Dems accusing Trump of using foreigners for political gain", "language": "en", "text": "There Sharyl Attkisson goes again, using facts and stuff.\n\nShe better be careful, Twitter has a bad habit of suspending and/or blocking people who make too much sense on their platform \u2026\n\nFactually speaking Sharyl is spot on here.\n\nIt seems to me, factually, that while some Ds accuse Trump of turning to foreigners to investigate a rival for political purposes, *they* are turning to foreigners to investigate a rival for political purposes. And some Ds already were proven to have done that in 2016. \u2014 Sharyl Attkisson\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@SharylAttkisson) October 8, 2019\n\nBut \u2026 wait for it \u2026 keep waiting \u2026 wait some more \u2026 just one more second \u2026 BUT ORANGE MAN BAD.\n\nThis is part of what\u2019s been making so many people nuts about the whole mess, the fact that Democrats appear to have done what they\u2019re accusing Trump of doing. It\u2019s not just the endless investigations that are annoying (and they are), but the absolute hypocrisy on the Left is off the freakin\u2019 charts.\n\nAs usual.\n\nIt seems to me Sharyl\u2026.Mr Trump is looking into the origins of 16?!?! And now Dems are accusing him of Foreign interference?! Because of the time proximity to next yrs election?! They, the Dems aren\u2019t very good at hiding their own malfeasance!!? \u2014 Joshua P Mason (@JoshuaPMason1) October 8, 2019\n\nSomething like that.\n\nSharyl responded:\n\nI don't know enough about the \"whistleblowers\" yet, but a reasonable person could theorize that those who are close to getting revealed for improper or illegal acts are lashing out in every way possible to try to prevent that. But I don't hear much said about that possibility. \u2014 Sharyl Attkisson\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@SharylAttkisson) October 8, 2019\n\nWell of COURSE she doesn\u2019t hear much about that possibility because nobody in the traditional media wants to cover it.\n\nThey have an agenda and a narrative to push, ya\u2019 know.\n\nProjection is the favorite tool of the sociopathic, narcissistic elite. \u2014 Jordan Sather (@Jordan_Sather_) October 8, 2019\n\nAnd nobody does \u2018narcissistic elite\u2019 better than Democrats.\n\nI am confused. My understanding the current request was to find the basis of the firing of the prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden in March 2016 prior to the election. How is this interfering with 2020? It seems to all lead to dems spying on Trump 2016. \u2014 Judy Burton \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JudyB28) October 8, 2019\n\nAccuse them of that which you are doing\u2026. \u2014 R. Dennis Hartman (@RDennisHartman) October 8, 2019\n\nBlame the Rs for what the Ds have been doing for years! The untold story. \u2014 Curtis A Smith (@CASPhotography) October 8, 2019\n\nThey\u2019ve been doing it for years, why stop now?\n\nRelated:\n\nFail to end ALL fails: Ellen Barkin accidentally shows how DUMB she really is while calling Trump supporters dumb and ROFL\n\nComplete and TOTAL coward: Clay Travis DROPS Warriors coach Steve Kerr for conveniently having NO COMMENT on NBA/China\n\nNothing to see HERE \u2013> Comey\u2019s FBI spokesman took \u2018monetary gifts\u2019 from CNN reporter (then lied about it under oath)", "description": "Sharyl really is problematic for people who can't stand facts.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Am On October", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sharyl-attkisson-full-measure.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
