REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\n\nIn September, the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and said it would revive its bond-buying programme indefinitely to cut borrowing costs and stimulate investment and growth in the euro zone.\n\nBut inflation in the euro zone still languishes at less than half the ECB\u2019s target and October\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) readings add weight to fears the economic outlook is darkening once again.\n\nIHS Markit\u2019s flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, was 50.2, just above September\u2019s more than six-year low final reading of 50.1 but still perilously close to the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and below expectations in a Reuters poll for 50.3.\n\n\u201cThings are really not getting any better yet. A slight improvement in October PMIs can\u2019t mask the fact that growth has almost stalled. The overall picture is one of a feeble economy,\u201d said Bert Colijn at ING.\n\nGermany\u2019s export-dependent manufacturing sector remained in contraction this month, earlier data showed, suggesting a third-quarter slowdown in Europe\u2019s largest economy could stretch into the closing months of the year.\n\nFrench activity picked up more than expected, however, boosted mainly by a firmer service sector.\n\n\u201cThe divergence between Germany and France persisted,\u201d said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cAll in all, the PMIs will make for uncomfortable reading at the ECB\u2019s policy meeting later today (Thursday) and will lend weight to the doves\u2019 calls for further policy action.\u201d\n\nDraghi chairs his final news conference later on Thursday but it is unlikely to be the grand finale he was hoping for.\n\nThe ECB is all but certain to not make any policy changes, six weeks after unveiling a package including new asset purchases worth 20 billion euros a month, a rate cut and a pledge to open the money taps further if needed.\n\nAn overwhelming majority \u2014 95% of economists who answered an additional question in last week\u2019s Reuters poll on the central bank \u2014 said this latest stimulus package would not significantly help in bringing inflation back to its 2% target ceiling.\n\nNorway\u2019s central bank kept its main interest rate unchanged on Thursday, as predicted, as did Sweden\u2019s. But the Riksbank surprised many by saying it expected to tighten policy in December, even though the economy is slowing more sharply than previously expected.\n\nEurope\u2019s traders prepared for Draghi\u2019s send off by pushing regional stocks to their highest in well over a year on Thursday and nudging the euro towards its best month since January 2018. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nThe Swedish crown surged 0.7% while the Norwegian crown was also dragged higher.\n\nFLATLINING\n\nIHS Markit said the euro zone PMIs indicated economic growth of just under 0.1% this quarter, below the 0.2% predicted in a Reuters poll last week.\n\n\u201cThe dataflow remains weak and is yet to signal a convincing trough in growth. Based on the PMIs alone, we\u2019re tracking broad stagnation in Q4,\u201d said economists at Morgan Stanley.\n\nGiving little hope for a turnaround anytime soon, an index measuring new business rose only slightly to 49.1 from 48.7, chalking up its second month below the breakeven mark.\n\nA PMI for the bloc\u2019s dominant service industry nudged up to 51.8 from September\u2019s 51.6, which had been its lowest reading since the start of this year. Economists had expected 51.9.\n\nWith the survey painting a gloomy picture, optimism among services firms was at its weakest since mid-2013. The business expectations index sank to 56.5 from 58.6.\n\nManufacturers also had a bad October and activity contracted for a ninth straight month, the PMI showed. It held steady at September\u2019s 45.7, a low not seen in seven years and missing the median expectation for 46.0.\n\nThe manufacturing output index, which feeds into the composite PMI, was 46.2, just pipping last month\u2019s 46.1 but its ninth sub-50 reading in a row.\n\nOctober\u2019s weak results were despite factory gate prices falling for a fourth month. The output prices index was 48.9 compared to September\u2019s 48.6.", "description": "Euro zone business activity stagnated in October as demand withered, according to a downbeat survey published on Thursday hours before European Central Bank President Mario Draghi makes his swansong appearance.", "authors": ["Jonathan Cable", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444415953&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0II", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
