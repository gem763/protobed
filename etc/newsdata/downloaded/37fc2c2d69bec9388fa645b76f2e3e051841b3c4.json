Junior is a two-year-long collaborative effort of stuntmen, Smith\u2019s performance capture, and most importantly the computer-generated work of effects house Weta Digital, according to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWhat is great about what Ang is trying to do with this film is give people a reason to go to the movie theater for an experience that your big screen television at home can\u2019t give you,\u201d Smith said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\nLee shot the movie in 3D, at 120 frames per second, which makes the film that much sharper and clearer, giving less wiggle room for things to look fake and touched up. \u201cYou see through people like light. With that requirement, I just don\u2019t think something that erases age will do. You have to create it from zero,\u201d Lee said at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n\nPARIS, FRANCE - SEPTEMBER 27: Ang Lee attends the Paramount Pictures, Skydance and Jerry Bruckheimer Films \"Gemini Man\" Post-Screening Q&A with Ang Lee at Cinema Pathe Beaugrenelle on September 27, 2019 in Paris, France.

[\u2018Gemini Man\u2019] is a little bit more immersive of an experience. You\u2019re experiencing it a lot more how your eye experiences the world. And then beyond that point, the creation of a 100% photorealistic digital human. So what can you do with that? That is an avatar now that will exist forever long beyond when I\u2019m here. People will be able to make movies with a 23-year-old version of me. Hopefully my grandchildren will sue them. At the end of the day it all comes down to storytelling. [Things like VR are other tools] for artists to be able to reach the human soul with joy and wisdom,\u201d Smith added.\n\nMovie ticket revenue in the U.S. increased 8% between 2017 and 2018, showing that despite all the existing and (soon to be coming) streaming platforms available, Americans still love going to the movies. The now defunct Moviepass actually incited others to take a page from the subscription model playbook. AMC (AMC), Regal (CINE.L) and Cinemark (CNK) all have their own monthly services. Of course, a handful of movies \u2014 typically superhero hits \u2014 make the lion\u2019s share of theater revenue.\n\nIn addition to his ongoing blockbuster films, Smith has a diverse career, having founded a digital production studio called Westbrook Media and having co-founded Dreamers, an early-stage VC firm.\n\nMelody Hahm is a senior correspondent at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
