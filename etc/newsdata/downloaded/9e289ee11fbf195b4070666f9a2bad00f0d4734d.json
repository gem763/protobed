The machine is working,\u201d Credit Suisse said in a note, adding that net profit beat Total\u2019s expectations for $2.8 billion.\n\nRival BP on Tuesday reported profit down 40% and Italy\u2019s ENI <ENI. last week post a 44% profit slide.\n\nTotal said that output growth particularly in liquefied natural gas production (LNG) that jumped by 55% helped it to generate strong cashflow.\n\nIts downstream businesses, including marketing and services as well as refining and chemicals, also had strong cashflow growth, rising 14% to $2 billion.\n\n\u201cDespite the volatile European refining margins, the downstream is well positioned to generate cashflow close to $7 billion in 2019,\u201d Total said.\n\nThe group bought back $1.15 billion of its shares in September and will buy back a total of $1.75 billion of its shares in 2019 as part of its $5 billion buyback programme over the 2018 to 2020 period.\n\nTotal said it will speed dividend growth and plans to reward shareholders with a third interim dividend of 0.68 euros per share, up 6% increase on 2018.", "description": "French oil major Total reported a smaller than expected third-quarter profit fall as record production growth countered crude and gas price declines that sent profit down 24% year on year.", "authors": ["Bate Felix", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446443562&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0EC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
