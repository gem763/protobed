I was a dress size 22 and with two young children, I couldn't run after them.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\n\"When your confidence is so low, you just think, 'what's the point, why bother? But the turning point was John's comments and I haven't looked back since.\"\n\nColette - who has now dropped from 13st 9lb to 10st 4lb - says she had tried loads of things in the past in order to lose weight, calorie cutting, hypnosis and joining weightloss groups but none of them worked.\n\nBut when she tried The 1:1 Diet, she was so happy with the results that she decided to work with them as a consultant.\n\nShe vividly remembers the day she realised she was a size 12, when she went to try on a new coat.\n\nShe added: \"I couldn't believe it when I made it to size 12, I remember going to try a coat on and I was thinking 'no way it will fit.'\n\n\"I did the button up and the zip and I just screamed 'I'm a size 12,' it was such a huge moment.\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\n\"I was so excited as the last time I was a size 12 I was in junior school- now being able to go into a shop and actually buy something is amazing, I just can't get over it.\n\n\"I am much happier now, I can actually look after my children, I feel healthier, everybody says I look better, I feel brighter.\n\n\"My self-esteem is absolutely through the roof now, which I didn't feel it before.\n\n\"I'm trying things out I never did before, I got a haircut, I had my nails done, those girly things before I was thinking 'why bother making myself look nice?'\n\n\"My journey since that pumpkin comment makes me feel like I've gone from being a pumpkin to Cinderella.\"\n\nBEFORE DIET Breakfast: a whole tin of tuna, cucumber and mayonnaise and a large glass of orange juice Lunch: a cheese sandwich, crisps, chocolate biscuits and a luxury yogurt dessert.
