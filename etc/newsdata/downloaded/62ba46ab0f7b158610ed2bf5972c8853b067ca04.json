But Marlon Anderson, 48, says he was just trying to defend himself after a disruptive student unleashed a number of obscenities on him, including that slur. West High Principal Karen Boran sent an email to families on Wednesday saying that racial slurs are not acceptable in schools, regardless of context or circumstance, the Wisconsin State Journal reported.\n\nAnderson said he was responding to a call on Oct. 9 about a disruptive male student who was being escorted by an assistant principal at West High. Anderson said the situation escalated, with the student, who is also black, calling Anderson obscenities including the slur. Anderson said he told the student multiple times \u201cdo not call me that,\u201d \u201cdo not call me that word,\u201d and that he repeated the slur during the confrontation while telling the teen not to use it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting this,\u201d Anderson told the State Journal of his firing. The Madison teachers\u2019 union filed a grievance with the district on his behalf. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand getting fired for trying to defend yourself,\u201d said Anderson, who worked for the district for 11 years. \u201cAs a black man, I have a right not to be called that word.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Scores of students walked out of class around 10 a.m. They walked to the Madison school district offices and marched laps around the building, chanting \u201cHey-hey, hey-ho, zero tolerance has got to go!\u201d and \u201cDo Better!\u201d\n\nMadison Police Department spokesman Joel DeSpain didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking an estimate on how many students took part.\n\nDuring his time at East and West high schools, Anderson said he\u2019s been called the slur by students \u201cmany times,\u201d and that it has resulted in \u201crestorative conversations\u201d in which he explains the history, context and meaning of the slur.\n\nPrincipal Boran said the zero-tolerance approach on the use of racial slurs \u201chas been applied consistently and will continue to be applied consistently.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also want to ask for your partnership as we work to make our school climate the very best it can be for all of our students and our staff,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district school board president, Gloria Reyes, said in a statement Friday that she wants the board to review its policy on racial slurs as soon as possible. She said she also has directed district staff to handle Anderson\u2019s grievance quickly. \u201cThis is an incredibly difficult situation, and we acknowledge the emotion, harm and complexity involved,\u201d she said. \u201cMany people in our community and our district are grappling with that complexity, and we will continue to do so as we go forward.\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Jane Belmore issued her own statement saying the zero-tolerance policy is designed to protect students from harm, no matter what the circumstances or intent. But she added that \u201cdifferent viewpoints\u201d from the community are emerging and the district will review the policy in light of Anderson\u2019s grievance.\n\nLast school year, there were at least seven cases in which a Madison School District staff member used a racial slur in front of students. All of those employees were either fired or resigned.\n\nIt\u2019s not known whether the student faces disciplinary action.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Marlon Anderson, a guard at West High in Madison, Wis. was fired after he repeated a racial slur while telling a student not to use it", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/students-protest-wisconsin-janitor-fired-nword.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
