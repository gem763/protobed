Past administrations routinely granted them an extension of their time here, but the Trump administration is committed to ending those extensions.\n\nThat move by the Trump administration is being challenged in the courts, but the new agreement guarantees Salvadorans at least a year\u2019s grace period after the court cases end.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s goal is to create an orderly and responsible process to repatriate Salvadorans and help them return home; however, a sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border,\u201d Homeland Security said in a statement announcing the deal.\n\n\u201cTaking into account these concerns, we have decided to provide additional time to work out that plan. We cannot allow the progress the President has made the past several months to be negated,\u201d the department said,\n\nSalvadoran Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill said her government, under President Nayib Bukele, will use the grace period to try to get the U.S. to granting the TPS holders a permanent status here.\n\n\u201cThe Salvadorans protected by the TPS are admirable people, who have worked for 20 years to build a future of well-being. Now, thanks to President Bukele, we can tell nearly 250,000 fellow citizens and their families that with the support of the United States they can continue to fight for their dreams,\u201d she said.\n\nThe deal, inked by Ms. Hill and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli, is the latest agreement between the Trump administration and Central American nations responsible for this year\u2019s border surge.\n\nOther deals give the U.S. the ability to send asylum-seekers who cross Central American countries back to those nations.\n\nTPS has long been a controversial part of the American immigration system.\n\nThe status was intended to be a temporary relief for citizens of countries facing war, political upheaval or natural disasters could remain here for the duration of the recovery, rather than returning home to nations unable to accommodate them.\n\nThe status was granted to hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans after an earthquake in El Salvador in 2001. The country looks completely different today, but the Bush and Obama administrations regularly renewed the TPS status nonetheless.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill compare TPS holders to illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d here under the Obama-era DACA deportation amnesty. Democrats say both classes of migrants are top priorities for a full amnesty granting them a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled an openness to the idea, though the price \u2014 changes to the legal immigration system and construction of a border wall \u2014 are too steep for Democrats.\n\nImmigrant-rights groups chided the administration Monday for the new deal, saying it was only a temporary extension.\n\n\u201cTPS holders and their families are not bargaining chips. They deserve a permanent solution, one that only Congress can give,\u201d said Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for America\u2019s Voice.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
