Maybe we'll have one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly,\" Trump said.\n\nHe also insisted a ceasefire announced from Turkey last week by Vice President Pence was holding despite \u201csome skirmishes.\u201d\n\nWhat to watch: The deal expires tomorrow night and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to resume his offensive if the so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d he\u2019s demanded isn\u2019t cleared of Kurdish fighters. Erdogan will be meeting tomorrow with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAccording to Brett McGurk, who resigned as Trump\u2019s counter-ISIS envoy over a planned withdrawal last December, it's now \"in the hands of Putin\" whether \"an epic humanitarian catastrophe\" unfolds in Syrian border cities like Kobane that had been held by Kurdish forces.\n\nBehind the scenes: I asked McGurk today whether he'd ever heard Trump express interest in what would become of Syria after the ISIS caliphate was defeated.\n\n\"He talked about defeating the ISIS caliphate, he takes credit for it, but beyond that I don\u2019t think he has much of a significant concern,\" McGurk said, speaking at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\n\nWhile the U.S. had several stated objectives in Syria that required long-term commitments \u2014 including remaining until Iran was out and the peace process finalized \u2014 McGurk said he never heard Trump himself vocalize them.\n\n\u201cIn fact, he basically says, \u2018the Russians and anybody else can do what they want,\u2019\u201d McGurk continued\n\nWhy it matters: \u201cIf the president isn\u2019t fully bought into a policy, particularly when it comes to war and peace ... when there's a crisis he\u2019s not going to really have anyone\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nTrump did express interest in what would happen to Syria's oil. McGurk said he explored the issue with Rex Tillerson, who was then secretary of state and previously ExxonMobil CEO.\n\nReality check: \"I think [Tillerson's] phrase was, 'That's not how oil works,' McGurk said, noting that the oil legally belongs to the Syrian state.\n\n\u201cMaybe there are new lawyers, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets.\"\n\nThe bottom line: \"We don\u2019t want these resources to get in the hands of terrorists or others, but maybe Trump should have thought about this before he basically made a decision that unraveled the tapestry that had been working relatively well,\" McGurk said.\n\nGo deeper ...
