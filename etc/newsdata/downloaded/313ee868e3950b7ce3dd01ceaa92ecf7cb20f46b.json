This time it\u2019s an evil frozen beef jester, who totally isn\u2019t a legally-acceptable stand-in for Ronald McDonald, which Wendy has in its sights: the company's whole schtick is 'fresh' food, relatively speaking, as opposed to McDonalds' reliance on frozen product.\n\nFans of D&D 5e will find much of the experience familiar, but the biggest difference I can see is that players ally their characters with \u2018Orders of Adventure\u2019 inspired by items on the Wendy\u2019s menu.\n\nThe Order of the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, for example, offers some fiery benefits based around fire damage, while the Order of the Baked Potato, which gives off some pretty healthy buffs to strength at the cost of some of your finer motor skills.\n\nSo if you ever wanted an excuse to do away with a grinning clown that fetishes ice-cold meat, now\u2019s your chance.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Kotaku UK, bringing you original reporting, game culture and humour from the British isles.", "description": "Wendy\u2019s, the American fast food chain best known for its burgers and lavish helpings of Twitter sass, is branching out into the tabletop RPG market.
