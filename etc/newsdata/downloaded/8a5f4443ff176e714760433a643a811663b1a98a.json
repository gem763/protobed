Listen to what he has to say about betting on Week 5. USA TODAY\n\nThe 2019 NFL season is only a month old, but some of its rookies are already making indelible imprints.\n\nQuarterbacks Gardner Minshew (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Daniel Jones (New York Giants) have electrified their fan bases after replacing established veterans. Oakland Raiders running back Josh Jacobs, Baltimore Ravens wideout Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown and Detroit Lions tight end T.J. Hockenson have begun justifying their first-round hype.\n\nThe New England Patriots' Chase Winovich and Carolina Panthers' Brian Burns are fast developing into effective situational pass rushers. And Devin Bush is blossoming into the tackling machine the Pittsburgh Steelers envisioned when they made the rare move \u2013 for them \u2013 to deal up for him in Round 1.\n\nWith 13 weeks to go, more freshmen will invariably step up. Here are 13 rookies who have been largely invisible but could leverage imminent or likely opportunities into breakout performances:\n\n1. Chargers S Nasir Adderley: With top safeties Derwin James and Adrian Phillips on injured reserve, there should be a golden chance for Adderley to flash the rare athleticism that made him a second rounder. However he'll have to overcome the hamstring injury that's mostly relegated him to special teams duty so far.\n\n2. Jets LB Blake Cashman: Injuries to C.J. Mosley and Avery Williamson have thrust the fifth rounder into the lineup, and he's played reasonably well, his 16 tackles tied for third on the team. A good athlete and decent pass rusher at Minnesota, Cashman could truly make a splash if coordinator Gregg Williams starts using him as a blitzer.\n\n3. Bengals QB Ryan Finley: Veteran passer Andy Dalton's performance has been in steady decline over the first four weeks, opponents apparently decoding Cincinnati's offense and exploiting a brutal line that left Dalton on the turf repeatedly Monday night, when he suffered a career-high eight sacks. If he and the team continue to circle the drain, good bet Finley receives an audition to prove he can do better.\n\nNFL roundtable: What's biggest surprise at quarter mark of 2019 season?\n\nWeek 5 picks: Cowboys or Packers in battle of 3-1 teams?\n\n4. Redskins QB Dwayne Haskins: This year's 15th overall pick got thrown to the wolves \u2014 well, more like jackals as it pertains to the Giants \u2014 in Week 4 and got picked off three times in his regular-season reveal. Haskins \u2014 probably wisely \u2014 won't start against the Patriots this Sunday, but it's inevitable that after breaking Big Ten passing records at Ohio State, he'll eventually get his shot. A Week 6 visit to Miami might be a prudent time to put him back on the field.\n\n5. Cowboys DT Trysten Hill: He finally got into the flow in Week 3 and has earned 61 snaps over the past two games. The highly talented Central Florida product can be a sub package disruptor between ends DeMarcus Lawrence and Robert Quinn, especially for a unit that's likely to be protecting quite a few leads \u2014 and that means hunting quarterbacks.\n\n6. Cardinals WR Andy Isabella: He played sparingly in September, but it might be time to unleash that 4.3 speed. Isabella has the goods to rack up yards after the catch in an \"Air Raid\" offense that's been dink and dunk thus far. More importantly, with Michael Crabtree gone and Christian Kirk and Damiere Byrd beaten up, Isabella figures to see a lot of action given Arizona rookie coach Kliff Kingsbury is dialing up the pass nearly 71% of the time.\n\n7. Steelers WR Diontae Johnson: He cracked the starting lineup in Week 3, claiming he wouldn't give up the new gig, and has shown his self-confidence to be well founded. Johnson has quickly earned new quarterback Mason Rudolph's trust, snagging nine balls for 129 yards and two TDs the past two weeks, and appears well on his way to being the primary wingman to No. 1 target JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\n8. Bills TE Dawson Knox: Buffalo has long been searching for an answer at the tight end position, and Knox has capitalized on his playing time, catching six passes for 125 yards and his first TD since high school over the past two weeks. Whether it's helping noodle-armed backup quarterback Matt Barkley in the short term or continuing to foster his chemistry with starter Josh Allen, Knox could soon settle into a prominent role for an offense needing more production from the passing game.\n\n9. Broncos QB Drew Lock: He fell into the second round in April, but Denver fans are already hoping he can be the long-sought successor to Peyton Manning under center. An August thumb injury landed Lock on IR, but he's eligible to return in November. With a season that may already be beyond reclamation, his unveiling might soon be all the Mile High City has to look forward to until the Nuggets take the court.\n\n10. Raiders WR Hunter Renfrow: A cult figure coming out of Clemson, the fifth-round slot man is steadily establishing himself in the post-Antonio Brown offense, ranking third among Oakland players in targets (18), receptions (11) and receiving yards (89). Renfrow's opportunities ought to expand once defenses begin devoting more focus to emergent Raiders tight end Darren Waller.\n\n11. Eagles RB Miles Sanders: Looks like the second rounder is starting to find his stride, rushing for a career-best 72 yards last week after accruing 126 yards from scrimmage in his previous outing. Sanders' production on kickoffs also makes him an all-purpose yardage threat. And with Philadelphia showing signs of heavier commitment to the ground game, Sanders is shaping up as one of the team's primary weapons.\n\n12. Colts S Khari Willis: Starting for injured Malik Hooker last Sunday, Willis played every defensive snap and racked up nine tackles and a pass breakup. Already a regular presence in sub packages and on special teams, the fourth rounder can now cement an even bigger role for himself.\n\n13. Browns LB Mack Wilson: Moving into the lineup after the loss of Christian Kirksey to a chest injury, Wilson hasn't come off the field the past two games even though there were pre-draft questions about this ferocious hitter's ability to survive in pass coverage. He's still got work to do on that front but has apparently earned enough confidence from the coaches to work through any growing pains.\n\nAnd lest you think I'm forgetting to dispense an honorable mention ...\n\nTitans G Nate Davis: My namesake had his coming-out party last week, playing 40 snaps in Tennessee's win at Atlanta. (Coincidence?) Prior to Davis' debut, quarterback Marcus Mariota had been subject to a league-high 17 sacks but wasn't bagged by the Falcons. (Coincidence?) And, in all seriousness, Davis is a quality blocker who could very well solve the Titans' issues at right guard.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "description": "Gardner Minshew and Daniel Jones have already taken on starring role, but these players could still be in for sizable roles later this season.", "authors": ["Nate Davis", "Published A.M.
