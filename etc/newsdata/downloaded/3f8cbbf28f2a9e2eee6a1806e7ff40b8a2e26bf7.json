Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) slammed President Donald Trump for turning the nation into \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s bitch\u201d after he assured the kingdom that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d as it waits to hear who may be behind an attack on its oil supply.\n\n\u201cTrump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate tweeted Sunday. \u201cHaving our country act as Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitch is not \u2018America First.\u2019\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump\n\n\n\nTrump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters. Having our country act as Saudi Arabia's bitch is not \"America First.\" https://t.co/kJOCpqwaQS \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) September 16, 2019\n\nGabbard previously accused Trump of making the U.S. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s bitch\u201d last November for his failure to take action against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who, according to the U.S. intelligence community, directed the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHours before Gabbard\u2019s latest remark, Trump said he had \u201creason to believe that we know the culprit\u201d of the weekend drone strike that cut the kingdom\u2019s oil production in half.\n\nThe president added that the U.S. is \u201cwaiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nThough Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday that there is no evidence it came from Yemen and called Iran the culprit.\n\nTehran has denied the allegation.\n\nThe damage has cut about 5.7 million barrels per day of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude oil output, which amounts to more than 5% of global daily oil supply.\n\nInitially, oil prices rose as much as 20% \u2015 the largest jump in a single day since the 1991 Gulf War \u2015 but retreated after Trump tweeted that he had authorized the use of oil from the U.S.\u2019s emergency oil supply, known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If needed, the president said, oil would be released \u201cin a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate slammed Trump for assuring Saudi Arabia the U.S. is awaiting its direction following an attack on the kingdom's oil...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7fc8c22300005805551a0d.jpeg?cache=ddccvhuwuv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
