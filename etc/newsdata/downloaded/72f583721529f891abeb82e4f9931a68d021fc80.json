REUTERS/Wissm al-Okili\n\nTraffic ran as normal through the Iraqi capital and streets and main squares were otherwise quiet. Concrete barriers blocked off areas where protesters in their thousands clashed with police during the week.\n\nOfficials from Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s office met protest leaders from Baghdad and other provinces to discuss their demands, state television reported. Abdul Mahdi and President Barham Salih said they would seek to meet the demands, state television also reported, but gave no details how exactly they would respond.\n\nAuthorities did not say why the curfew was lifted.\n\nThe country\u2019s parliament speaker proposed on Friday improving public housing for the poor and job opportunities for young people, as well as holding those who had killed protesters to account.\n\nThe unrest is the deadliest that Iraq has seen since the declared defeat of Islamic State in 2017 and has shaken Abdul Mahdi\u2019s year-old government. The government has responded with vague reform promises that are unlikely to placate Iraqis.\n\nThe semi-official High Commission for Human Rights said security forces had detained hundreds of people for demonstrating but then let most of them go. It said more than 3,000 people had been wounded in days of violence.\n\nPolice snipers shot at protesters on Friday, Reuters reporters said, escalating violent tactics used by the security forces that have included live fire, tear gas and water cannons.\n\nThe security forces have accused gunmen of hiding among demonstrators to shoot at police. Several policeman have died.\n\nThe protests over unfair distribution of jobs, lack of services and government corruption erupted on Tuesday in Baghdad and quickly spread to other Iraqi cities, mainly in the south.\n\nA curfew in Dhi Qar province, where protesters were also killed this week, was ordered by local authorities starting from 1 p.m.\n\nPowerful Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has a mass popular following and controls a large chunk of parliament, demanded on Friday that the government resign and snap elections be held. At least one other major parliamentary grouping allied itself with Sadr against the government.\n\nParliament was set to meet on Saturday to discuss protesters\u2019 demands. Sadr\u2019s bloc has said it will boycott the session.", "description": "Iraqi authorities lifted a days-long curfew in Baghdad on Saturday that anti-government protesters had defied, as the toll from four days of violent unrest rose to 72 killed and hundreds injured.", "authors": ["John Davison", "Aref Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437359328&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF94062", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
