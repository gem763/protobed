There are clear paths forward for each of these potential challenges, but both the challenges and solutions are still at the blackboard level. We won\u2019t necessarily know their relative importance until we are in the clinic,\" says Hsu, who was not part of this study.", "description": "\"This should be a wake-up call,\" a study author says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/7Md1wX9Y88eiDuIXsiVYsoSJ17A=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2018/07/16/1531778316965.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-16"}
