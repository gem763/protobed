USA TODAY\n\n\u201cParasite\u201d sounds like an unnerving horror movie about unwanted invaders, but that\u2019s just one aspect that completely works in this socially conscious delight.\n\nOne of the most well-rounded movies you\u2019ll see this year, the South Korean film-fest favorite (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expanding throughout October) also balances black comedy, biting social satire, human drama and thriller twistiness for a refreshing effort that's familiar enough in its themes to be extraordinarily inviting. The latest excellent effort for writer/director Bong Joon-ho (\u201cThe Host,\u201d \u201cOkja\u201d) is a more entertaining version of \u201cRoma,\u201d an Oscar-ready, slice-of-life foreign film that challenges its audience to look inward.\n\nMashing up a variety of genres, \u201cParasite\u201d is at its heart a morality tale centering on two disparate families: the poor Kims and the well-to-do Parks. With the shiftless Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) as their patriarch, the unemployed Kim clan live in squalor: Their apartment is a dingy, claustrophobic basement dwelling (with the most interesting view being a frequently urinating vagrant); family members steal wi-fi from the coffee shop, and they fold pizza boxes as their main source of income.\n\nCannes Film Festival: 'Parasite' becomes the first Korean film to win Palme d'Or\n\nOscar watch: These 6 movies are already the talk of awards season\n\nChoi Woo-shik (from left), Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Park So-dam star as a scheming South Korean family in the black comedy \"Parasite.\" (Photo: NEON)\n\nWhile poor, they also prove to be a bunch of desperate, scheming grifters when the chance arises. Siblings Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik and Ki-jung (Park So-dam) can\u2019t pass university entrance exams but they get an A-plus in charisma: With fake diploma in hand, Ki-woo is recommended by a friend to the wealthy Parks as an English tutor for their teenage daughter (Jung Ziso). He charms the girl\u2019s flighty mom Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong) and then gets his sister installed as an art teacher for the Parks\u2019 young son (Jung Hyun-jun).\n\nThe Kims\u2019 underhanded shenanigans \u2013 and parasitic tendencies \u2013 continue as Ki-taek takes over as the driver for workaholic Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and conniving Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) becomes the Parks\u2019 live-in housekeeper after ousting longtime employee Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun) by using a peach allergy against her.\n\nMuch of the film's first act is played for dark humor until a major shoe drops for the Kims one stormy night when they're partying at the palatial estate while the Parks are off on a birthday weekend getaway. Suddenly, a somewhat breezy story takes a sinister turn, and things get vicious and violent but also downright heartbreaking.\n\nMr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong) are wealthy targets for grifters in \"Parasite.\" (Photo: NEON)\n\nThe movie is expertly paced with its reveals, never falls apart (even when it descends into bloody chaos) and also features outstanding acting performances, especially from Song. His Ki-taek is a failed businessman yet still has some pride, and the actor sells the character\u2019s quiet seething as Mr. Park puts him in his place with withering comments. And while they don\u2019t always outwardly show it, there is a close love among the Kims, which gets tragically tested over the course of the film.\n\nLike Bong\u2019s similarly themed \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d class warfare is a major theme of \u201cParasite,\u201d as the greedy have-nots worm their way into the lives of the haves \u2013 and indeed make that existence their own for a time. But the movie also leans into the cautionary side, that it all can be horrifyingly washed away in an instant.\n\n\u201cParasite\u201d doesn\u2019t villainize its ne\u2019er-do-wells or heroize its victims \u2013 other than one bright Morse-coding boy, the Parks are a rather clueless bunch who can\u2019t really relate to the travails of the Kims. Amid the black comedy, there\u2019s a lesson to be had about maybe not loving your neighbor but at least understanding them in a landscape chock-full of inequity, and in that vein \u201cParasite\u201d attaches to you and doesn\u2019t let go.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/08/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-brilliant-black-comedy/3901855002/", "description": "Bong Joon-ho's latest effort 'Parasite' attaches and doesn't let go in a genre-defying tale about a well-to-do clan and a family of poor grifters.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
