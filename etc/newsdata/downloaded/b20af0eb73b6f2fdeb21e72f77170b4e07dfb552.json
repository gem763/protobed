Meanwhile, life goes on, and presumably everyone around him will continue to validate his daring fashion choices \u2014 a beguiling mixture of tie-dyed shirts, fisherman hats, and Prada.\n\nPeople reports that the bride-to-be is a manager for beauty company Violet Gray and has held previous jobs at Kith NYC and HBO, according to her LinkedIn. She and Hill were first thought of as a couple in August 2018 after they were seen walking together through New York City. On Labor Day they were spotted heading to brunch together; Santos appeared to be wearing an engagement ring.\n\nPics of the happy couple are hard to come by, but here\u2019s one from Hill\u2019s mom\u2019s Instagram of the two surrounded by loved ones, looking absolutely inscrutable.\n\nAccording to E! News, Santos has frequently appeared in Jonah\u2019s family\u2019s Instagram images, be they of Passover, Hanukkah, or Thanksgiving celebrations.\n\nVariety reported on Tuesday that Hill recently paid $6.8 million for a Southern Colonial\u2013style residency in Santa Monica. The house features a swimming pool and an inset spa and a brick pizza oven and a guesthouse that has its own sauna. Variety describes the house as \u201cundeniably classy,\u201d situated such that it allows \u201cfor cool canyon breezes to gently caress the structure.\u201d In short, the house is crawling with sensations: hot, cool, windy, you name it. A smattering of exterior doors are ideal for leaving the house at one\u2019s leisure.
