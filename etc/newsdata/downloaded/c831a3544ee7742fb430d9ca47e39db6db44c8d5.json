We had to get it all done in a matter of an hour or so.\n\n\u2018We had to hide the fact that it was us and try not to let people see the actual wedding in case it got spoiled. On top of it all, I had the flu.\n\n\u2018So one of the most romantic kisses in the show\u2026 is actually just me giving her a huge kiss on the cheek because I didn\u2019t want to get her sick.\u2019\n\nHey, nothing says love quite like sharing a flu virus, right?\n\nJim and Pam fell in love working at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company (Picture: NBC/Getty)\n\nBut both him and Jenna weren\u2019t prepared for how loved the series became \u2013 especially Jim and Pam and their relationship, and for it to continue 10 years later.\n\nJenna said: \u2018I feel like everyone in their love story journey has had a moment of unrequited love or yearning for a person, so I think that kind of hooked people early on. But I really have to give credit to John Krasinski\u2019s performance.\n\n\u2018In our second episode [of season one], Jim goes after a big sale and Dwight ends up stealing it from him. But in his final talking head, Jim says it was a pretty good day, and he\u2019s saying that because Pam fell asleep on his shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That look on Jim\u2019s face, every woman out there wanted a man to look like that when they talked about her.\u2019\n\nJim and Pam had what it takes to stand the test of time (Picture: NBC)\n\n\u2018It makes me so happy [that people still watch],\u2019 she added. \u2018It really does deeply resonate with people and is meaningful beyond just being entertaining.\u2019\n\n\u2018I feel honored and love that the show is still out there and making people laugh.\u2019\n\nMore: The Office Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey are launching a podcast about The Office Tips from The Office US's Jim and Pam you can take to make your relationship work The Office turns 18: How Dawn and Tim's kiss became the greatest love story of our time\n\nJohn added: \u2018To be honest, it\u2019s hard to compute. We all had such a blast and felt that the show was as big as it would ever be when we ended it\u2026. Man, were we wrong!\n\n\u2018It will always be the greatest honor to have been a part of a show this special.\u2019\n\nThe Office US seasons 1-10 is available on Amazon Prime Video in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
