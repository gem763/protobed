JOE CALLAGHAN gives his ratings.\n\n\n\nGERMANY\n\nManuel Neuer: 7\n\nThirty-two years after Harald Schumacher grabbed the headlines against France, Neuer had a quieter afternoon.\n\n\n\nPhilipp Lahm: 7.5\n\n\n\nRemoved as defensive midfield pivot to steady a shaky defence, the captain thrived in more familiar ground.\n\n\n\nJerome Boateng: 6\n\n\n\nPreferred to Per Mertesacker as Hummels' partner but still looked vulnerable to balls over the top.\n\nVIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany fans celebrating their side's win over Fance\n\n\n\nSave: Manuel Neuer was strong in goal for Germany as per and helped them win with a clean sheet Stop: Neuer kept Germany in the tie right up to the final few minutes when France threatened to equalise Mats Hummels: 7\n\nWas missed so badly against Algeria but returned here to contribute hugely. A superb header opened the scoring.\n\nBenedikt Howedes: 6.5\n\nNot in his natural role but continues to show little evidence of being uncomfortable as a full back.\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger: 7.5\n\nAnother to benefit from the Lahm switch, he revelled in being the quarterback again. Couple of key interceptions too.\n\nLeap: Germany defender Jerome Boateng (right) tries to win the ball during the quarter-final clash Peace: Bastian Schweinsteiger (right) made key interceptions and looked comfortable as quarterback Sami Khedira: 6\n\nNot as busy as his defensive midfield partner but got through what work he had diligently. Deserved yellow card from cynical play.\n\nThomas Muller: 6.5\n\nRemoved from false nine duties to act as a deeper and wider foil in the attack but still an absolute pest.\n\nToni Kroos: 6.5\n\nThe man with the most completed passes in the tournament was at it again. Superb delivery for the opener.\n\nRally: Thomas Muller encourages his Germany team-mates during their crucial win over France Opener: Germany celebrate after their first goal to get them on their way to the World Cup semi-finals Mesut Ozil: 6\n\nNeeded an upturn against Algeria and provided it. Carried that improved form here. Busy if a little isolated from play.\n\nMiroslav Klose: 6\n\nLow went horses for courses and finally called on his World Cup thoroughbred. Led the line energetically but threw in an awful dive too.\n\nManager Joachim Low: 8\n\nMade some huge calls in team selection and saw one immediately justified with Hummels' goal.\n\nYellow cards: Khedira (54), Schweinsteiger (80) Boss: Germany manager Joachim Low (right) chats with assistant coach Hansi Flick during the win Celebrate: Germany made the semi-finals after seeing off France in a tight encounter Premier League pedigree: Per Mertesacker hugs Bacary Sagna in the tunnel after the crunch match\n\nFRANCE\n\nHugo Lloris: 6\n\n\n\nNothing the captain could do about Mats Hummels' header. Attempts at quick distribution came to little.\n\n\n\nMathieu Debuchy: 6\n\n\n\nMarshalled Ozil relatively well. Tried to get forward plenty but got little change out of Howedes.\n\n\n\nRaphael Varane: 5\n\n\n\nPreferred to Laurent Koscielny but so easily out-muscled by Mats Hummels for the opener. Not a great day out.\n\nIn: Hugo Lloris dives to make a save but couldn't stop Mats Hummels from giving Germany the lead Backtracking: Lloris could do nothing about Hummels' header and could not captain his side to victory Mamadou Sakho: 5.5\n\nStill struggles to convince that he's the \u00a315million defender Liverpool thought they were getting. Nervy.\n\nPatrice Evra: 6\n\nToiled at times against Nigeria but more solid here. Superb cross to Benzema before break deserved better.\n\nYohan Cabaye: 6\n\nWithdrawn after 73 minutes of trying - but failing - to control operations in midfield. Lacked support but he's had better days.\n\n\n\nBeaten: Patrice Evra loses out on a header during France's loss to Germany in the quarter-final Task: Yohan Cabaye was withdrawn after 73 minutes after trying - but failing - to control the game Blaise Matuidi: 5.5\n\nBlessed not to have been suspended for this one but he struggled to impose himself at times in the middle.\n\nPaul Pogba: 6.5\n\nTook it to the Germans with five first-half dribbles but we've already come to expect so much more. For him, a quiet day.\n\nMathieu Valbuena: 6\n\nHe might not make it much higher than the corner flag but he has really raised his game in Brazil. Not enough though.\n\nControl: France crashed out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals but Germany make the final four Heading home: Benzema couldn't find the back of the net, despite his last-gasp effort Karim Benzema: 6\n\nDrew back-to-back blanks after a red-hot start to the tournament but had chances to get back on the board here. Couldn't take them.\n\nAntoine Griezmann: 5.5\n\nCould have laid one on a plate for Benzema early on had he steadied himself. Little impact overall.\n\nManager Didier Deschamps: 6\n\nLike his opposite number, made a change in central defence but it wasn't nearly as successful.\n\nYellow cards: NONE Gutted: France crashed out of the World Cup at the hands of Germany and will be heading home\n\nFrustrated: France manager Didier Deschamps could do little to lift his team to the World Cup semi-finals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Germany saw off France in a dramatic World Cup quarter-final to book their place in the final four.", "authors": ["Joe Callaghan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/04/article-2681053-1F64941400000578-724_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-07-04"}
