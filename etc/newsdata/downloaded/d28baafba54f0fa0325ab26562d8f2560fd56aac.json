Peter Barsoom, the CEO of 1906 \u2014 a Colorado-based cannabis-edibles brand \u2014 can attest to that.\n\nHis company closed an $18 million funding round on Tuesday, bringing the infused-chocolate maker's valuation to between $40 million and $50 million, the company said. The round was led by Navy Capital, a cannabis-focused fund in New York City, and included a variety of high-net-worth people and repeat investors.\n\nBarsoom shared the pitch deck that he used to raise this round exclusively with Business Insider.

Courtesy of 1906\n\nBarsoom, who came to cannabis after working in senior roles across Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Blue Mountain Capital, said it took seven months to close the funding round.\n\n\"We did see headwinds like anybody in the cannabis space,\" Barsoom told Business Insider over the phone. \"The fallout from the IPO bubble happened fast and furious.\"\n\nOnce plentiful, at least at the early stages, growth capital has slowly dried up for cannabis companies as public companies in the sector have seen their share prices crater. That has made venture investors wary of startups in the space, Barsoom said.\n\n\"I think that many companies went out to the public markets thinking that capital was infinite and time horizons were infinite,\" Barsoom said. \"So I think what we're seeing today is likely to be the Pets.com and the Webvans of the cannabis space.\"\n\nFor that reason, Barsoom said he was focused on keeping 1906 private \u2014 for now.\n\n\"The right set of capital that needs to fund this industry is growth capital, and not necessarily public-market capital. So there was a mismatch that led to a bubble and sharp decline,\" Barsoom said.\n\nBut for long-term investors, Barsoom said the thesis held that cannabis \"is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing segments of the economy that anybody has witnessed in our history.\"\n\n1906 is using the fresh funding to expand to the East Coast\n\nThis latest funding round builds on 1906's prerevenue raise in 2016, when the company raised $2.7 million.\n\nWith the fresh capital, Barsoom is looking to expand 1906's low-dose THC and CBD infused chocolates to new state markets, including Michigan, Illinois, and Massachusetts \u2014 states where he says the company can generate the highest return on invested capital.\n\n\"California is a crowded market,\" Barsoom said. \"I'm from the East Coast. We think our brand has a strong resonance with East Coast consumers and has an East Coast sensibility.\"\n\nTo that end, 1906 released a line of \"Drops,\" or pressed tablets that contain low doses of THC and CBD, as an alternative to the company's infused chocolates.\n\nThe company isn't the only brand to release a line of infused tablets. The cannabis startup Dosist \u2014 which is known for its vapes \u2014 released tablets in October as well.\n\nAnd despite the expansion plans, Barsoom believes in running a \"lean team.\"\n\n\"We've seen \u2014 literally in the last week or two \u2014 hundreds of layoffs in the industry, where companies have unfortunately overextended themselves with hiring and that has resulted in a pretty significant pullback,\" Barsoom said. \"We're focused on disciplined growth, adding people where critical and staying lean, and kind of, finally, not overextending ourselves.\"\n\nSee the pitch deck that 1906 used to raise $18 million below:", "description": "Raising money for cannabis startups is challenging.
