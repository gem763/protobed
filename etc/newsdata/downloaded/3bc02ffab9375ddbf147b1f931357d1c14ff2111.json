Here\u2019s a look back at some of the most recent and egregious hate-crime hoaxes:\n\n1. At Hofstra University in 2009, a freshman girl claimed she was gang-raped by five men in a dormitory, only to recant her claims when a video of the sexual encounter surfaced showing she was not forced at all. Four men were arrested before she finally admitted she was lying.\n\n2. Meghan Lanker-Simons of the University of Wyoming anonymously posted fake rape threats to herself on Facebook in 2013 in a case that got national media attention.When police investigated the incident, they found \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Lanker-Simons posted the fake rape threat from her own personal computer while it was in her possession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. A little over a year ago at Oberlin College, two students conducted a massive series of racist stunts such as putting up a Nazi flag, passing out anti-Islamic fliers, and putting a \u201cwhites only\u201d sign above a water fountain. After getting classes cancelled for a \u201cDay of Solidarity,\u201d one of the students said that the entire thing was a \u201cjoke\u201d in order to get an \u201coverreaction.\u201d\n\n4. In one of the most famous hate-crime hoaxes of late, Crystal Mangum falsely accused three Duke lacrosse players of raping her in 2006. Following the allegations, the Duke lacrosse team was suspended for two games; the coach, Mike Pressler, was forced to resign; and the three accused were arrested and vilified by the national media. The charges were eventually dropped and Mike Nifong, the corrupt Durham County district attorney, was removed, disbarred, and sued into bankruptcy. In November 2013 Mangum was convicted of murdering her boyfriend.\n\n5. Last year, a lesbian waitress in Connecticut, Dayna Morales, claimed that a couple wrote on a receipt, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I cannot tip because I don\u2019t agree with your lifestyle & how you live your life.\u201d After Morales gained national media attention and received thousands of dollars in donations that she promised she would give to Wounded Warriors, the accused couple revealed that they wrote no such note and actually left a rather generous 20-percent tip. Morales was exposed as having a history of lying, and Wounded Warriors said that they had never received a donation from Morales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Oprah Winfrey whirled up a media frenzy last year after accusing a Swiss sales assistant of racism. Winfrey said the saleswoman told her that \u201cyou don\u2019t want to see this bag\u201d because Winfrey is black. \u201dIt is too expensive. You cannot afford it.\u201d The sales assistant felt powerless caught in the media \u201ccyclone,\u201d as she put it, and flatly denied having ever told Winfrey she could not afford the item. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she is making these accusations,\u201d the saleslady said. \u201cShe is so powerful and I am just a shop girl.\u201d\n\n7. Last fall Vassar College was struck by a string of hateful remarks spray-painted on student residences, including \u201cFuck N*ggers\u201d and \u201cHey Tranny, Know Your Place.\u201d A few days after the university\u2019s Bias Incident Response Team reported that multiple offenses had occurred on campus, the university announced that the perpetrators were actually two members of the Bias Incident Response Team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Two gay parents were throwing a birthday party for their child earlier this year when they received a note from a homophobic parent saying her child would not attend the party because she would \u201cnot subject my innocent son to your \u2018lifestyle.\u2019\u201d The media were outraged until it was revealed that there were no gay parents, no allegedly homophobic parent, and no birthday party. In fact, the entire spectacle was a joke created by a New York radio show in order to \u201cspur a healthy discourse on a highly passionate topic,\u201d as they explained.\n\n9. In 2011, two lesbians told authorities that someone had spray-painted \u201cKill the Gay\u201d on their garage and left a noose at their door. They said it was probably the Homeowner\u2019s Association retaliating against over a dispute about their dog. However, the FBI investigated and found out that the women had spray-painted their garage themselves and likewise had placed the noose on their own doorstep. They were charged with criminal mischief and false reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Joseph Baken claimed that three men had beaten him after he came out as a homosexual at a bar. A picture of his bruised faced was widely circulated online, and Baken was held up as a victim of homophobia. Soon after his short rise to fame, a video surfaced showing Baken attempting a backflip on a paved street. He struck his face on the curb exactly where the injuries were in his viral picture. Soon after, he pled guilty to filing a false police report.\n\n11. Alexandra Pennell, a student at Central Connecticut State University, reported that she had received an anti-gay message under her door. As an apparent target of hate, she spoke at an anti-hate rally for hundreds of students. But when the police tried, through a surveillance camera outside her room, tried to find out who it was, they found that the camera had been disabled. After setting up a hidden camera, they discovered Pennell was the one writing her own hate letters. She did not admit it until the police showed her the video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Alec Torres is a William F.
