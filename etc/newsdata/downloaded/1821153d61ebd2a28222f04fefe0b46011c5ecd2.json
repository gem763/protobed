I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019m bringing you the top news stories this morning from home and abroad.\n\nJustin Trudeau has apologised after a photograph emerged of him wearing brownface makeup at a fancy dress party when he was a young teacher. The Canadian prime minister said he \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d the incident at the school in Vancouver in 2001. \u201cIt was something I should not have done,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.\u201d He also admitted to doing the same on another occasion to sing the Harry Belafonte song, Day O. \u201cObviously I regret that I did it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself, obviously.\u201d He told reporters he had made numerous calls to friends and colleagues \u2013 and expected to make more on Thursday.\n\nThe timing of the picture\u2019s release by Time magazine comes as Trudeau seeks reelection next month in what was already a very tight race. His conservative opponent, Andrew Scheer, has consistently used the prime minister\u2019s ethical lapses to attack Trudeau and he seized on the blackface picture, saying his rival was \u201cunfit to govern\u201d.\n\nRoyal eyebrow \u2013 David Cameron has admitted that he sought the Queen\u2019s intervention when polls showed that Scottish nationalists might win the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The former prime minister says in the BBC\u2019s The Cameron Years documentary next week that he had not asked for anything improper, \u201cjust a raising of the eyebrow, even you know a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference\u201d. Shortly afterwards, the Queen was reported as telling churchgoers near Balmoral that people should \u201cthink carefully\u201d about voting to split from the UK.\n\n\u2018An emergency\u2019 \u2013 A majority of the public believe the climate crisis is the gravest problem facing the world and that politicians are not doing enough to tackle it, according to a survey carried out in eight countries. As millions of people around the world prepare to flock to what are expected to be the biggest climate protests ever seen tomorrow, the survey shows that the climate breakdown is ranked above migration, terrorism and the global economy in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Brazil and Canada. Only in the US does it not have top billing, coming in behind terrorism and affordable healthcare. It comes as the teenage activist, Greta Thunberg, urged US Congress to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d and take some action.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greta Thunberg at the US Congress.

Although it is still not clear what the backstop solution might be, we were given a clue of sorts when it emerged that Johnson, on his chaotic visit to Luxembourg on Monday, had allegedly been surprised at how many border checks would be needed in Ireland. Add that to the homework list.\n\n> Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster indicated yesterday that she might accept a bespoke border solution for Northern Ireland to overcome the backstop problem. Her party has previously resisted having different rules from the rest of the UK.\n\n> There was a neat soundbite at the second day of the supreme court hearing into the prorogation of parliament. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, a Scottish advocate opposed to the suspension, said Johnson\u2019s government is unworthy of trust because it conspired to ensure that \u201cthe mother of parliaments\u201d was closed down by \u201cthe father of lies\u201d. It\u2019s the last day of the hearings today.\n\n> Labour MPs and activists are set for their own Brexit battle at next week\u2019s conference in Brighton. Many are unhappy about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to try to stay neutral on the issue in any election campaign and want the party to commit to a remain stance. The party is also reportedly going to review the language of Tony Blair\u2019s landmark Clause IV reforms next week.\n\nThe last harrumph \u2013 Mornings will never be the same again when rottweiler-in-chief John Humphrys steps down from the Today programme after an epic 32-year stint. Colleagues share their memories of the presenter whose gladiatorial style has earned him as many brickbats as plaudits, but who has defined an era of more confrontational journalism. James Naughtie says working with Humphrys was \u201cnever dull and always exhilarating\u201d while former Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer says the 76-year-old\u2019s \u201cfearlessness\u201d had been \u201cof incalculable value\u201d. And finally, here are some of harrumphing Humph\u2019s famous highs and lows.\n\nChina\u2019s Loch Ness monster? \u2013 There was great excitement in China this week after pictures circulated on social media showing what appeared to be some sort of giant sea creature in the Yangtze river. There was speculation that a Loch Ness-style monster could have been spawned by pollution in the giant waterway. But, alas, the reality is more prosaic after it was established that the \u201ccreature \u2013 dubbed the Three Gorges Water Monster\u201d \u2013 was actually a 20m-long industrial airbag.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Teenagers trapped by the county lines\n\nAamna Mohdin tells Anushka Asthana how county lines gangs are stepping up their operations by using short-term holiday flats and recruiting local teens to sell drugs in small towns around Britain. Plus Owen Jones on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s \u2018neutral\u2019 stance on Brexit.\n\nToday in Focus 1909county Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/09/18-64757-190918TIF_countylines.mp3 00:00:00 00:25:22\n\nLunchtime read: Turbot? Okra? What\u2019s your least favourite food?\n\nDespite the explosion in exotic dishes and ingredients available at British restaurants in recent years, it seems there are some that not even our leading chefs like that much. We\u2019ve spoken to some of them and gleaned an idea of how people on the other side of the kitchen divide feel about globe artichoke (\u201cfaffy\u201d), turbot (\u201cthat mucus is absolutely disgusting\u201d) and even coriander (\u201cit gets everywhere\u201d). For Jason Atherton, chef-proprietor of the Social Company restaurants, okra is the worst of the lot. \u201cOkra is the most foul thing ever grown,\u201d he says. \u201cI refuse to work with it. If I see it in a dish, I ask for it to be removed.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nMauricio Pochettino accused his Tottenham players of lacking fight in the 2-2 Champions League draw at Olympiakos and suggested that they needed to work harder on the psychological side of their game. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan scored the pick of the goals as Manchester City eased to a 3-0 away victory over Shakhtar Donetsk, while \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda scored twice against his former club and Gareth Bale had a goal ruled out by VAR as Paris St-Germain beat Real Madrid 3-0. Wales have a readymade replacement for Rob Howley, who has left Japan after a suspected breach of World Rugby\u2019s betting regulations, but pre-World Cup upheaval rarely bodes well, writes Paul Rees. The culture secretary has called for top women\u2019s sport to be added to televised sport\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels\u201d list, which would guarantee them exposure to potentially mass audiences on free-to-air television that men\u2019s tournaments currently enjoy. And the death of Fernando Ricksen, the former Rangers and Netherlands player, has brought to a close a six-year battle with motor neurone disease.\n\nBusiness\n\nAsian markets have edged higher after the decision by the US Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by 0.25%. The widely expected move was largely priced in by investors. The FTSE100 is seen opening down this morning while the pound is buying \u00a31.248 and \u20ac1.130.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nThe Express leads with \u201cEU demands: show Brexit plan in 12 days or \u2018it\u2019s over\u2019\u201d, the Telegraph says \u201cRees-Mogg urges Farage supporters to return to the Tory fold\u201d and the Times reports on debates around Labour\u2019s constitution: \u201cLabour starts to reverse Blair\u2019s Clause 4 reforms\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian has: \u201cSaudis to Trump: here\u2019s our proof \u2013 now world must respond to Iran\u201d, while the FT says: \u201cFed rate cut follows second bid to ease overnight lending squeeze\u201d. The Mirror claims the murders of four women resemble the killings committed by Christopher Halliwell: \u201cConfession killer: \u20184 more victims\u2019\u201d and the Sun has: \u201cLoch yes monster!\u201d, reporting that a huge \u201ceel-like creature\u201d has been filmed which the paper says experts believe \u201creally is the monster\u201d.\n\nThe i leads with a story that there has been a surge of HIV tests after former rugby star Gareth Thomas went public with his condition: \u201c\u2018Have the courage to speak out. Don\u2019t be afraid\u2019\u201d, the paper quotes him as saying.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
