Whether the Wolverines are good enough to achieve those goals is still very much up in the air.\n\nThe 19th-ranked Wolverines jumped out to an early lead over No. 14 Iowa at home on Saturday, and managed to hold on for a 10-3 victory.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty. The Michigan offense scored all 10 points in the game\u2019s first seven minutes, but wouldn\u2019t get back on the board for the rest of the afternoon. Meanwhile, Iowa\u2019s offense would advance to midfield or better seven times, but routinely shot itself in the foot under the pressure of the Michigan defense.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe bad vibes for Iowa\u2019s offense began early when Mekhi Sargent fumbled on the Hawkeyes\u2019 first play from scrimmage, setting up a short field goal for Michigan. From there, it wouldn\u2019t get better. Iowa quarterback Nate Stanley threw three interceptions on the afternoon, including two in Michigan territory, and was sacked a whopping eight times.\n\nIowa\u2019s second-to-last drive on offense pretty much summed up the afternoon. As the clock ticked inside the six-minute mark, Stanley threw his best pass of the afternoon, a 31-yard dime to Tyler Goodson to the Michigan 25-yard line. But between that big gain and Iowa\u2019s punt from its own 49-yard line on fourth-and-36, Iowa was flagged for two holding penalties, an ineligible man downfield and a false start before losing 12 yards on a sack.\n\nIowa\u2019s offense got one final shot to force overtime, but the Michigan defense got yet another stop to seal the victory.\n\nMichigan's defense had eight sacks in a 10-3 win over Iowa.

A win is a win, and this win came on the back of the Michigan defense.\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo weeks after getting completely dominated at the line of scrimmage in a blowout loss at Wisconsin, Michigan was on the other side of that equation this week. Iowa\u2019s usually stalwart offensive line was overwhelmed all afternoon with UM getting pressure in Stanley\u2019s face and ultimately forcing four turnovers. That\u2019s an impressive turnaround for Don Brown\u2019s defense after getting manhandled by the Badgers in Madison three weeks ago.\n\nBut the offense, on the other hand, still has a lot of question marks. Shea Patterson was only 14-of-26 for 147 yards and an interception. Patterson\u2019s best throw was a 51-yarder to Nico Collins to set up the game\u2019s only touchdown, but he continues to underwhelm on a weekly basis.\n\nThe running game wasn\u2019t much better. The Wolverines mustered only 119 yards on 33 attempts, an average of just 3.6 yards per rush. In all, Michigan was limited to just 267 yards and was forced to punt eight times. Some of that is the product of a stout Iowa defense, but it does not look like the Michigan offense has taken any steps forward as the season has progressed. The struggles that existed early in the year are still present, even if Harbaugh doesn\u2019t think they are.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re hitting our stride\u201d \u2014 Harbaugh on the offense \u2014 angelique (@chengelis) October 5, 2019\n\nIf Michigan wants to realistically compete in the Big Ten East, it\u2019s going to take a pretty miraculous turnaround on offense. The Wolverines have a trip to Illinois next weekend in what should be a pretty easy win. But the following two weeks \u2014 a trip to No. 12 Penn State and home game against No. 9 Notre Dame \u2014 will likely set the tone for the rest of the season. And maybe even Harbaugh\u2019s future with the program.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "All of Michigan\u2019s preseason goals are still in front of it.
