Do a search on Google\u2019s Play store in Europe and you\u2019ll find the company\u2019s own Gboard app has an age rating of PEGI 3 \u2014 aka the pan-European game information labelling system which signifies content is suitable for all age groups.\n\nPEGI 3 means it may still contain a little cartoon violence. Say, for example, an emoji fist or middle finger.\n\nNow do a search on Play for the rival Fleksy keyboard app and you\u2019ll find it has a PEGI 12 age rating. This label signifies the rated content can contain slightly more graphic fantasy violence and mild bad language.\n\nThe discrepancy in labelling suggests there\u2019s a material difference between Gboard and Fleksy \u2014 in terms of the content you might encounter. Yet both are pretty similar keyboard apps \u2014 with features like predictive emoji and baked in GIFs. Gboard also lets you create custom emoji. While Fleksy puts mini apps at your fingertips.\n\nA more major difference is that Gboard is made by Play Store owner and platform controller, Google. Whereas Fleksy is an indie keyboard that since 2017 has been developed by ThingThing, a startup based out of Spain.\n\nFleksy\u2019s keyboard didn\u2019t used to carry a 12+ age rating \u2014 this is a new development. Not based on its content changing but based on Google enforcing its Play Store policies differently.\n\nThe Fleksy app, which has been on the Play Store for around eight years at this point \u2014 and per Play Store install stats has had more than 5M downloads to date \u2014 was PEGI 3 rating until earlier this month. But then Google stepped in and forced the team to up the rating to 12. Which means the Play Store description for Fleksy in Europe now rates it PEGI 12 and specifies it contains \u201cMild Swearing\u201d.\n\nThe Play store\u2019s system for age ratings requires developers to fill in a content ratings form, responding to a series of questions about their app\u2019s content, in order to obtain a suggested rating.\n\nFleksy\u2019s team have done so over the years \u2014 and come up with the PEGI 3 rating without issue. But this month they found they were being issued the questionnaire multiple times and then that their latest app update was blocked without explanation \u2014 meaning they had to reach out to Play Developer Support to ask what was going wrong.\n\nAfter some email back and forth with support staff they were told that the app contained age inappropriate emoji content. Here\u2019s what Google wrote:\n\nDuring review, we found that the content rating is not accurate for your app\u2026 Content ratings are used to inform consumers, especially parents, of potentially objectionable content that exists within an app. For example, we found that your app contains content (e.g. emoji) that is not appropriate for all ages. Please refer to the attached screenshot.\n\nIn the attached screenshot Google\u2019s staff fingered the middle finger emoji as the reason for blocking the update:\n\n\u201cWe never thought a simple emoji is meant to be 12+,\u201d ThingThing CEO Olivier Plante tells us.\n\nWith their update rejected the team was forced to raise the rating of Fleksy to PEGI 12 \u2014 just to get their update unblocked so they could push out a round of bug fixes for the app.\n\nThat\u2019s not the end of the saga, though. Google\u2019s Play Store team is still not happy with the regional age rating for Fleksy \u2014 and wants to push the rating even higher \u2014 claiming, in a subsequent email, that \u201cyour app contains mature content (e.g. emoji) and should have higher rating\u201d.\n\nNow, to be crystal clear, Google\u2019s own Gboard app also contains the middle finger emoji. We are 100% sure of this because we double-checked\u2026\n\nThis is not surprising. Pretty much any smartphone keyboard \u2014 native or add-on \u2014 would contain this symbol because it\u2019s a totally standard emoji.\n\nBut when Plante pointed out to Google that the middle finger emoji can be found in both Fleksy\u2019s and Gboard\u2019s keyboards \u2014 and asked them to drop Fleksy\u2019s rating back to PEGI 3 like Gboard \u2014 the Play team did not respond.\n\nA PEGI 16 rating means the depiction of violence (or sexual activity) \u201creaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life\u201d, per official guidance on the labels, while the use of bad language can be \u201cmore extreme\u201d, and content may include the use of tobacco, alcohol or illegal drugs.\n\nAnd remember Google is objecting to \u201cmature\u201d emoji. So perhaps its app reviewers have been clutching at their pearls after finding other standard emojis which depict stuff like glasses of beer, martinis and wine\u2026 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOver on the US Play Store, meanwhile, the Fleksy app is rated \u201cteen\u201d.\n\nWhile Gboard is \u2014 yup, you guessed it! \u2014 \u2018E for Everyone\u2019\u2026 \ud83e\udd14\n\nPlante says the double standard Google is imposing on its own app vs third party keyboards is infuriating, and he accuses the platform giant of anti-competitive behavior.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all-in for competition, it\u2019s healthy\u2026 but incumbent players like Google playing it unfair, making their keyboard 3+ with identical emojis, is another showcase of abuse of power,\u201d he tells TechCrunch.\n\nA quick search of the Play Store for other third party keyboard apps unearths a mixture of ratings \u2014 most rated PEGI 3 (such as Microsoft-owned SwiftKey and Grammarly Keyboard); some PEGI 12 (such as Facemoji Emoji Keyboard which, per Play Store\u2019s summary contains \u201cviolence\u201d).\n\nOnly one that we could find among the top listed keyboard apps has a PEGI 16 rating.\n\nThis is an app called Classic Big Keyboard \u2014 whose listing specifies it contains \u201cStrong Language\u201d (and what keyboard might not, frankly!?). Though, judging by the Play store screenshots, it appears to be a fairly bog standard keyboard that simply offers adjustable key sizes. As well as, yes, standard emoji.\n\n\u201cIt came as a surprise,\u201d says Plante describing how the trouble with Play started. \u201cAt first, in the past weeks, we started to fill in the rating reviews and I got constant emails the rating form needed to be filled with no details as why we needed to revise it so often (6 times) and then this last week we got rejected for the same reason. This emoji was in our product since day 1 of its existence.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he can think of any trigger for Fleksy to come under scrutiny by Play store reviewers now, he says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know why but for sure we\u2019re progressing nicely in the penetration of our keyboard. We\u2019re growing fast for sure but unsure this is the reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect someone is doubling down on competitive keyboards over there as they lost quite some grip of their search business via the alternative browsers in Europe\u2026. Perhaps there is a correlation?\u201d he adds, referring to the European Commission\u2019s antitrust decision against Google Android last year \u2014 when the tech giant was hit with a $5BN fine for various breaches of EU competition law. A fine which it\u2019s appealing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll continue to fight for a fair market and am glad that Europe is leading the way in this,\u201d adds Plante.\n\nFollowing the EU antitrust ruling against Android, which Google is legally compelled to comply with during any appeals process, it now displays choice screens to Android users in Europe \u2014 offering alternative search engines and browsers for download, alongside Google\u2019s own dominate search and browser (Chrome) apps.\n\nHowever the company still retains plenty of levers it can pull and push to influence the presentation of content within its dominant Play Store \u2014 influencing how rival apps are perceived by Android users and so whether or not they choose to download them.\n\nSo requiring that a keyboard app rival gets badged with a much higher age rating than Google\u2019s own keyboard app isn\u2019t a good look to say the least.\n\nWe reached out to Google for an explanation about the discrepancy in age ratings between Fleksy and Gboard and will update this report with any further response. At first glance a spokesman agreed with us that the situation looks odd.", "description": "Platform power is a helluva a drug.
