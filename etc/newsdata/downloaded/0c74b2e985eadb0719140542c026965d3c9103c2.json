While they are ranked as \u201cleast concern\u201d on a list of endangered species drawn up by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, they are now sparse in western Europe.\n\nDependent for their survival on water resources, which glaciers provide, the eagles disappeared from France altogether 200 years ago and only a few remain on the Swiss side of the border.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately today glaciers are the main problem because we can see clearly that they\u2019re melting at an incredible speed,\u201d said Jacques Olivier Travers, a co-founder of Eagle Wings and one of Victor\u2019s falconers.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\n\u201cSo we need to protect this environment first to be able to bring these eagles back into the wild,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers say Alpine glaciers are melting at an alarming rate with before and after photographs showing them retreating up valleys over the last century.\n\n\u201cAround the world we have had over the last 50 years an increase of temperature of around 0.8 degrees (Centigrade). In the Alps, an average of 1.5 degrees. And here ... in Mont Blanc, it is 2 degrees. So (it has) already (reached) the worst prediction that scientists gave for climate change in the next century,\u201d said Menzel.", "description": "Victor, a nine-year old white-tailed eagle, set off this week on a mission to raise awareness of climate change in the Alps, which have already been hard hit by the rise in global temperatures.", "authors": ["Johnny Cotton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438859809&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981BN", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
