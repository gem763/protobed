(Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)\n\nJennifer Arcuri, an American business executive and former model who is at the center of inquiries dogging the new British prime minister, declined to answer \u2014 nine times \u2014 whether she had an affair with Boris Johnson while he served as mayor of London.\n\nThe story has been competing with Brexit headlines for a week in Britain, because Arcuri won sponsorship and grants from the British government while she was Johnson\u2019s friend.\n\nArcuri has been described by British tabloids as Johnson\u2019s former \u201ctechnology adviser\u201d and \u201cthe pole-dancing American tech entrepreneur . . . previously photographed draped in a Union Jack.\u201d\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan launched an independent review into how Arcuri managed to accompany Johnson on government-sponsored trade missions in 2014 and 2015 to Singapore, Tel Aviv and New York, and why the American won sponsorship from the city\u2019s London & Partners promotional group when Johnson was London mayor. Khan insisted that he has no interest in their relationship outside the use of public funds.\n\nIn her first broadcast interview since her ties to Johnson were reported, Arcuri told ITV\u2019s \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d show that when Johnson was mayor, he visited her apartment in east London a \u201chandful of times,\u201d somewhere between five and 10.\n\n\u201cWe tried having drinks out in public or having lunch; it just became too much of a mob show, so I said: \u2018You just have to come to my office,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nArcuri\u2019s apartment also had a pole for dancing.\n\n\n\nHacker House\u2019s founder and CEO, Jennifer Arcuri.

She declined to answer, saying, \u201cBecause the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I am really not going to answer that question. I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponize my answer.\u201d\n\nArcuri did describe her relationship with Johnson as very close.\n\nAsked whether she loved Johnson, Arcuri said: \u201cI care about him deeply as a friend, and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well. I want him to be happy. I wish Carrie well. And I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again.\u201d\n\nCarrie Symonds is Johnson\u2019s partner, and the two live together at the prime minister\u2019s official residence at 10 Downing Street. Symonds, a former Conservative Party media aide and now a campaigner for preserving the oceans, is 31. Johnson is 55. Johnson is in divorce proceedings with his second wife, Marina Wheeler, after 25 years of marriage. They have four children.\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman told reporters Monday that he had \u201cnothing to add\u201d to the Arcuri interview. The prime minister said last week when asked about his dealings with Arcuri, \u201cEverything was done entirely in the proper way.\u201d\n\nArcuri told the morning show that Johnson spoke for free at four events she ran. She added that \u201che never, ever gave me any favoritism.\u201d Arcuri now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nStories of Johnson\u2019s private life have been fodder for British newspapers \u2014 and respectable biographies \u2014 for years.\n\nIn the latest charge, a Sunday Times columnist said that when Johnson served as editor of the Spectator, a conservative weekly magazine, he groped her upper thigh during a boozy staff luncheon in the late 1990s.\n\nThe Arcuri story is clearly a distraction for the new prime minister, who has vowed to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by Oct. 31, \u201cdo or die.\u201d His recent Brexit proposal was given a chilly reception by European leaders. Whether the Arcuri matter hurts him with voters in a general election, forecast to be held before year\u2019s end, is unclear.\n\nHis supporters dismiss the story as \u201cBoris being Boris,\u201d or as a hit job by his political enemies.\n\nHis critics see a reckless boy-man who is careless with public funds.\n\nIn her interview with the morning show, Arcuri said, \u201cBoris had nothing to do with my other achievements.\u201d\n\nWhile she was still in her 20s, Arcuri\u2019s company, Innotech, was awarded $33,000 in public funding when Johnson was mayor. She also joined foreign trade missions led by Johnson, despite initially being rebuffed, according to British press reports.\n\nArcuri\u2019s new company, Hacker House, was given a $123,000 grant earlier this year by the British government\u2019s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the London Times reported.\n\nAn oversight committee at the London Assembly has asked Johnson to explain the appearance of conflicts of interest over Arcuri.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Tech entrepreneur and former model Jennifer Arcuri is at the center of an inquiry into whether the former London mayor helped her win lucrative grants.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tF2a4Y2ASglLV6aGFMv3mqZE2zw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SWQTDNHJBYI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
