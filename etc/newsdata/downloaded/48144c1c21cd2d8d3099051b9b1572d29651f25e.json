If she can win in Paris she can certainly thrive here.\n\nShe has a tremendously versatile forehand and a brilliant sliced backhand. Her volleying is excellent and she has an outstanding serve for her height, 5ft 5in. All the tools to win here.\n\nAsh Barty, the Women's No 1, has all the tools to secure victory at Wimbledon this year\n\nNaomi Osaka (JAP) 21\n\nSeed: 2\n\nLast year: 3rd rd\n\nShe may have learned a bit about handling expectations from her third-round defeat in Paris. You can tell Naomi has been modelled on Serena \u2014 she has a very similar swing on the backhand and tremendous power on both sides.\n\nHer movement has dramatically improved in the past year and grass should suit her better than clay.\n\nNaomi Osaka's movement has improved dramatically and she should fare well on grass\n\nKarolina Pliskova (CZE) 27\n\nSeed: 3\n\nLast year: 4th rd\n\nIt is still a bit of a mystery why she has not done better here. Her great strength is her serve but she has to be aggressive.\n\nShe likes the high bounce and should be dangerous if it's warm. The big hurdle for her is getting that first Slam title.\n\nKarolina Pliskova has struggled at Wimbledon but her serve is her great strength\n\nAngelique Kerber (GER) 31\n\nSeed: 5\n\nLast year: Winner\n\nAs Serena found out in last year's final, the German is an outstanding mover and a great counter-puncher \u2014 she played an awesome match that day.\n\nHer movement on grass reminds me a bit of Andy Murray and she can win points from tough positions, which is one reason she has such a good Wimbledon record.\n\nLast year's winner Angelique Kerber makes good use of her movement on grass\n\nPetra Kvitova (CZE) 29\n\nSeed: 6\n\nLast year: 1st rd\n\nShe knows her way around the grass court as well as anybody and it may benefit her that she has not overplayed and should be fresh.\n\nHer lefty serve sets up her whole game of first-strike tennis that puts opponents under pressure. At her best she can be almost unplayable.\n\nPetra Kvitova can be almost unplayable at times and her serve can cause major problems\n\nSimona Halep (ROM) 27\n\nSeed: 7\n\nLast year: 3rd rd\n\nComing in as a lower seed than at recent Grand Slams may help her, and unlike last year she won't be thinking about having just won Roland Garros.\n\nShe is a great athlete with a terrific backhand, an under-rated serve and bags of fighting spirit. I would not be surprised if she makes a strong run.\n\nSimona Halep's fighting spirit could help her enjoy a strong run at Wimbledon this year\n\nSerena Williams (USA) 37\n\nSeed: 11\n\nLast year: Runner-up\n\nThe fear factor is starting to wane a little for the other players. She has struggled for court time with her knee problems and finds herself in the roughest quarter of the draw.\n\nHer game is so well suited to grass and this is her best chance to win another Slam. The best serve in history and fantastic returns, so it would be foolish to write her off.\n\nIt would be foolish to write off Serena Williams but the fear factor is starting to wane\n\nJo Konta (GB) 28\n\nSeed: 19\n\nLast year: 2nd rd\n\nKonta likes to play 'red line' tennis but I thought she was giving herself more margin for error at the French Open. At her best she is a bit like Serena or Kvitova, setting the point up with her serve and putting her opponent under pressure by taking the ball on early in the rally.\n\nRoland Garros was a real step forward and it looks like her coach, Dimitri Zavialoff, has done a good job since teaming up with her. One of maybe 15 players who can win it.\n\nJo Konta has a chance of winning Wimbledon and made a real step forward at Roland Garros\n\nMEN\n\nNovak Djokovic (SER) 32\n\nSeed: 1\n\nLast year: Winner\n\nI had him down to win three Slams this year and still think that's possible. It's his ability to put so many returns in court and play controlled offence that demoralises opponents.\n\nHis match in the semis against Rafa Nadal last year must have been one of his best ever, so he has some fresh memories of playing brilliantly at SW19. The favourite.\n\nNovak Djokovic is the favourite in the men's tournament and can win three slams this year\n\nRoger Federer (SWI) 37\n\nSeed: 2\n\nLast year: QF\n\nStill playing majestic tennis. If anything he is playing more aggressively off his backhand this year, less afraid to use it down the line.\n\nRoger has also become an incredible starter of matches, he goes at guys hard and fast and before they know it they're a set down. The backhand continues to fascinate me, it's the best one-hander in history.\n\nRoger Federer is still playing majestic tennis and his backhand is the best one-hander ever\n\nRafael Nadal (SP) 33\n\nSeed: 3\n\nLast year: SF\n\nHe got so close to beating Djokovic last year which shows he can still play on grass. Nobody makes adjustments better than Rafa, hitting it flatter and powering up his serve.\n\nHe has a tough draw but if he does not get derailed in the first week he will be lethal in the second.\n\nRafael Nadal faces a tough draw but could be lethal if he gets through to the second week\n\nKevin Anderson (SA) 33\n\nSeed: 4\n\nLast year: Runner-up\n\nThe big South African comes in after a rough year when he has had an elbow injury that made him miss the clay court season.\n\nThat will not make it easy for him but he had some great memories from last year when he showed his durability. A decent mover for his height and has loads of power, plus his returns go deeper than anyone bar Djokovic. A potent first and second serve.\n\nAn elbow injury has frustrated Kevin Anderson but he has a potent first and second serve\n\nDominic Thiem (AUT) 25\n\nSeed: 5\n\nLast year: 1st rd\n\nVery impressed with him this year but his return of serve on grass can be a problem. He's made a good coaching change to ex-Olympic champ Nicolas Massu.\n\nNobody hits the ball faster off both forehand and backhand than this guy and his serve is a bomb, but does he have that ultimate belief on grass?\n\nAlthough Dominic Thiem's serve is a threat, his return of serve on grass is an issue\n\nAlex Zverev (GER) 22\n\nSeed: 6\n\nLast year: 3rd\n\nAfter winning at the O2 Arena I thought he was going to have a great season but it hasn't happened.\n\nHe can be too passive and should look at how he played in November, when his serve was massive. He's a great mover for his height, 6ft 6in, and his backhand is outstanding.\n\nAlex Zverev has failed to build upon winning the ATP Finals and can often be too passive\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas (GRE) 20\n\nSeed: 7\n\nLast year: 4th rd\n\nThe most variety of all the young guys and that's why he's a future champion in my eyes. A key asset is his ability to finish points when moving forward.\n\nHis forehand is already up with the best and I love the way he's prepared to dive for the ball. A great athlete and I like his attitude \u2014 we should be very excited by the gifted Greek.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas has the most variety of all the young players and has an excellent attitude\n\nKei Nishikori (JAP) 29\n\nSeed: 8\n\nLast year: Quarter-final\n\nSolid as a rock with a great backhand, especially down the line. He is also a top mover but he keeps getting sucked into five setters at Slams and by the time he gets to the quarters he's wrecked.", "description": "The 2019 Wimbledon Championships get underway on Monday.
