Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can lead to a build-up of fatty plaque in the arteries, which can cause blockages and lead to heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommended in 2014 that statins be offered to people whose 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, is greater than 10 per cent.\n\nThis individual risk is worked out using factors such as age, ethnicity and social background, and whether the person smokes or has diabetes.\n\nWhereas previously around 40 people with a low risk would have to be treated to prevent one major cardiovascular event, the number is now around 400, the study found.\n\nPaula Byrne and John Cullinan, from the National University of Ireland Galway, and Susan Smith, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, argue that the benefits of statins are unclear for many people.\n\n\"Although statins are commonly prescribed, serious questions remain about their benefit and acceptability for primary prevention, particularly in patients at low risk of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThe team said using statins for low-risk groups \"may be an example of low-value care and, in some cases, represents a waste of healthcare resources\".\n\nThey added that research has found that statin use can be associated with a rare but serious increased risk of muscle problems, diabetes and haemorrhagic stroke.\n\nThey pointed to a study which found a 65-year-old man prescribed statins, who smokes, has high cholesterol and blood pressure, but no heart disease, could lower his absolute risk of heart disease or stroke over the next decade from 38 to 29 per cent.\n\nHowever a low-risk 45-year-old woman who does not smoke, but has high cholesterol and slightly raised blood pressure, would see her risk drop from the already small 1.4 to 0.8 per cent.\n\nThey said this risk reduction is so small it may not justify taking a daily pill. The researchers also looked at the introduction of 2016 European guidelines recommending more people be given statins.", "description": "Millions of people are taking statins unnecessarily, a new study suggests.", "authors": ["Henry Bodkin", "Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/12/13/31234402_wwwAlamycom_C0W49N-Statin-Pills-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gqsW2GA9nAM4IFtGNFTInME.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
