REUTERS/Emmanuel Herman\n\nErick Kabendera, who has written for national and international publications, including Britain\u2019s The Guardian and The Times of London, was arrested at his home in Dar es Salaam on July 29.\n\nPolice said he was detained over issues concerning his citizenship, but on Aug. 5 he was charged with leading organised crime, failing to pay taxes and money laundering.\n\nKabendera\u2019s lawyer and rights group say the charges against him are politically motivated.\n\nA frail-looking Kabendera appeared at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate\u2019s Court in Tanzania\u2019s commercial capital Dar es Salaam on Friday, where his case was adjourned to Sept. 12, reportedly because the prosecutors\u2019 investigations are incomplete.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the court to instruct prisons authorities to take Kabendera to a government hospital for urgent medical attention,\u201d Kabendera\u2019s lawyer Jebra Kambole told Reuters after the hearing.\n\n\u201cHis health has been deteriorating since August 21,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has difficulty breathing and has been complaining about numbness in one of his legs.\u201d\n\nThe journalist is being held at the Segerea prison, a maximum security facility, on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam. Most of Tanzania\u2019s prisons are overcrowded, resulting in poor conditions for inmates, rights groups say.\n\nThe journalist\u2019s lawyers urged prosecutors to expedite the case and transfer it to the country\u2019s High Court for subsequent hearings, where the journalist will be allowed to enter a plea.\n\nRights groups say press freedom in Tanzania has drastically deteriorated since the election in 2015 of President John Magufuli, whose administration has suspended some newspapers, arrested opposition leaders and restricted political rallies. The government has rejected the criticism.\n\nThere have been growing calls for the government to review laws that deny bail to criminal suspects for some offences.\n\n\u201cMoney laundering charges have effectively become a political weapon ... because it is not a bailable offence, it is now being widely used for retaliation to punish certain people by putting them in detention for several months or even years,\u201d Nyaronyo Kicheere, a Dar es Salaam-based lawyer, told Reuters.\n\nTanzanian Chief Justice Ibrahim Juma last month called for legal reform to make all criminal offences bailable in the East African nation.\n\nBritain and the United States urged Tanzania earlier this month to guarantee due process of law in Kabendera\u2019s case.\n\nOn Thursday the International Federation of Journalists, a global union, urged Tanzanian authorities to drop what they called \u201cfabricated charges\u201d.", "description": "Lawyers for a prominent Tanzanian investigative journalist called on Friday for urgent medical attention for their client after a court adjourned his case for the third time since he was arraigned nearly a month ago.", "authors": ["Fumbuka Ng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424398933&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T0XZ-OZATP"}
