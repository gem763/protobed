It's usually lampposts and light boxes.'\n\nAnn believes the person responsible has more serious issues than those of the infamous Queensland 'poo jogger', who defecated outside a block of flats in Greenslopes, just 17km away from Everton Park.\n\n'They may have had stomach issues, but this appears to be a deviant,' she said.\n\nAnn also claimed the poo-smearer targeted a nearby shopping centre, as well as the office of local MP Tim Mander.\n\nBut a police spokeswoman said there was a record of wilful damages offences in Cutbush Street, but none pertaining to faeces.\n\nAnn said she was pleasantly surprised that the Cutbush C****er didn't strike again after the most recent storm.\n\nBut she said without a name or CCTV footage of the offending, it will be hard to track down the 'deviant' responsible.\n\nA spokesman for Brisbane City Council said a resident complained to them in April regarding the Kedron Brook walking path near South Pine Rd.\n\nBut they said the council hasn't received any complaints about Cutbush Road.\n\nPeople defecating in public has made headlines in recent weeks, after PR maven Roxy Jacenko posted footage of a female jogger pooing outside her Sydney office.\n\nJacenko uploaded videos of the woman running behind a car, pulling down her pants and relieving herself on two separate occasions, while in broad daylight.\n\n'It's disgusting, it's a lovely street lined with heritage terraces, kids playing and riding their bikes,' she later told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nThe 'Paddington Pooper' saga was featured on A Current Affair last week and concluded with host Tracy Grimshaw telling viewers the mystery blonde was identified - but her name has yet to be made public.\n\nAccording to Grimshaw, the woman tried to cover her tracks by 'deleting her social media accounts' after security footage of the obscene act went viral following Roxy's public plea for assistance last Monday.", "description": "Residents of Cutbush Street in the Brisbane suburb of Everton Park claim the culprit has left excrement on the footpath, lampposts and utility pit covers.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20075282-0-image-a-28_1571827913533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
