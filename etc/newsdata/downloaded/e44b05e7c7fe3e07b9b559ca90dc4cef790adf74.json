Liverpool, rebuilt and rebooted since 2010 under their US investor owners, arrive on Sunday as European champions and Premier League leaders at an Old Trafford groaning under United\u2019s US owners, who have plundered the club and bungled the Ferguson succession.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s owners, John Henry\u2019s Fenway Sports Group, did not fully understand what they were taking on when they bought a club so steeped in history and emotion, but they learned from their early missteps and gradually refurbished Anfield with expertise. United\u2019s owners, the six siblings of the Glazer family, bought the club in their debt\u2011loading raid in 2005, enjoyed the fruits of Ferguson\u2019s genius but are now on their fourth manager since his 2013 retirement with their former banker Ed Woodward in charge of the club.\n\nThe big difference between Manchester United and Liverpool? Leadership | Eni Aluko Read more\n\nThe contrasts are stark: a new main stand at Liverpool and Anfield Road redevelopment in the planning, while Old Trafford has leaked and lost its lustre. Liverpool made key changes in 2012 after the early \u00a335m signing of Andy Carroll undermined the \u201cmoneyball\u201d hype, and have since justified it with the analytics-informed recruitment of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and the rest of a Champions League-winning squad.\n\nUnited say they have put together a modern football scouting and decision-making structure which informed the \u00a3145m in summer signings of Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, although they do not have a head of recruitment like Liverpool\u2019s Michael Edwards or a director of football, as Manchester City have in Txiki Begiristain. Liverpool carefully identified Klopp as their ideal manager, City waited four years for Pep Guardiola, while United \u2013 after the miseries of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and late Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 look to have gambled on Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r being able to vault several steps on a managerial CV.\n\nFSG does not buy sports clubs as a philanthropist; it works to increase their financial value. But it has taken no money out of Liverpool in nine years, except a modest \u00a310m repayment of \u00a3110m loaned for the building of the main stand. The Glazers\u2019 takeover, designed by Woodward to load \u00a3540m borrowings on a debt-free club, has since cost more than \u00a31bn in interest, fees, refinancing penalties and other dead money.\n\nThe Glazers have relocated Manchester United\u2019s company registration from Sir Matt Busby Way in Old Trafford to the Cayman Islands tax haven, and floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, and the club has paid a dividend, most of it to the Glazers, for the last four years. The latest, declared in the United 2018-19 accounts filed last month, was \u00a323m, of which the five Glazer brothers and their sister Darcie Glazer Kassewitz shared approximately \u00a318m.\n\nHenry and his FSG co-investors Tom Werner and Mike Gordon \u2013 who is credited with steering the revival since he took personal responsibility for Liverpool in 2012 \u2013 have never taken a salary from the club. All six Glazers are directors, and on the payroll. At United, the struggles to replace Ferguson and modernise the operations contrast with the clinical thought and detail applied to the Glazers\u2019 financial engineering.\n\nWoodward, who worked on the United acquisition for the Glazers and their late father Malcolm while at the bank JP Morgan, came up with the \u00a3275m \u201cpayment in kind\u201d hedge fund loans at an initial 14.25% interest, to bridge the gap with a \u00a3265m bank loan and \u00a3270m the family itself put in. When the debts were refinanced a year later, the hedge fund debts had escalated by \u00a379.1m, which included a \u00a313.2m charge for \u201cearly redemption\u201d.\n\nDocuments in 2010 setting out another refinancing of debt, which had swollen to \u00a3700m, revealed the Glazers had, since 2006, been paid \u00a310m in \u201cmanagement and administration fees\u201d and Kassewitz and each of her five brothers had borrowed \u00a31.66m, \u00a310m in total, from the club.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ed Woodward worked on the United acquisition for the Glazers and their late father Malcolm while at the bank JP Morgan.

They hold all the B shares, which are not listed on the stock exchange but do accrue dividend payments and have 10 times the voting rights of the A shares. Ultimately the Glazers\u2019 route to a fabulously profitable sale is to convert the B shares into A, which are publicly traded and bought by investors such as the banks whose executives hold those awkward public investor calls with Woodward every quarter.\n\nUnited\u2019s annual report notes that a company registered overseas does not have to follow the standard corporate governance standards of the New York stock exchange.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we follow certain corporate governance practices of our home country, the Cayman Islands,\u201d the report states. \u201cSpecifically, we do not have a board of directors composed of a majority of independent directors, or a remuneration committee \u2026 composed entirely of independent directors.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of independent, or non-executive, directors is to apply objective scrutiny of how a company is being run and hold its executives to account. United\u2019s board includes Woodward, Richard Arnold, the well-regarded group managing director, the chief financial officer Cliff Baty, three independents, Kassewitz and all five of her brothers. Joel and Avi are acknowledged to be the only two of the Glazers involved in the day\u2011to\u2011day running of the club. They, with one of the independents, Robert Leit\u00e3o of the bankers Rothschild, sit on the remuneration committee which decides the pay of the directors. The total paid to the board and executive management in 2018-19 was \u00a310.7m, which the accounts do not break down individually. Woodward is paid by a subsidiary company, Manchester United Football Club Ltd; his salary in 2017-18, the most recently published, was \u00a34.152m.\n\nThe Glazers have made more than \u00a3200m selling slices of their shareholdings to investors, and one day, surely, the persistent speculation about a sale will culminate in them cashing out, perhaps as suddenly as they bought United, largely unwelcomed, in 2005.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nDefenders of the ownership point to the reality that the debts and payments to the Glazers are not a looming burden any more, as they were in the early years when Ferguson\u2019s fire carried them through. Under the Glazers and Woodward, United are a commercial behemoth, their latest multi\u2011sponsor record revenues \u00a3627m, although that will drop this season because of their absence from the Champions League. The debt remains vast, \u00a3511m, and costs \u00a325m in interest, but United can wave that away, and the \u00a323m dividends, without really feeling it. The club points to an average annual net spend on players of more than \u00a3100m over the past seven years, more than any other club except their Abu Dhabi-funded noisy neighbours.\n\nYet City\u2019s Barcelona-modelled structures mean they have spent their money rather more effectively and, like Liverpool, have comprehensively eclipsed United. The signing of so many players for so little reward at United prompts questions rather than answers, about the culture at the club whose owners have taken such fortunes out since their hostile takeover 14 years ago.", "description": "John Henry\u2019s FSG has put in a net \u00a3100m at Liverpool in nine years but at Manchester United the financial backdrop to their on-field struggles is very different", "authors": ["David Conn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be666fa4a6ea26a3f5630c986796ba0859b56a9e/0_211_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ebb0641524cbcc33f19a5a49842d12d", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
