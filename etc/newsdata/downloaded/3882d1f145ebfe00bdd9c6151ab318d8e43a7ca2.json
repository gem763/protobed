We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nDemocrats have been slicing and dicing the memo to fit their narrative. It's time we fairly analyze all the facts available.\n\nDemocrats are pinning their latest impeachment hopes on the theory that President Donald Trump tried to enlist Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden to sway the 2020 election. But as the White House phone record release Wednesday shows, the issue is really about the dirty tricks that were being played in 2016.\n\nLook at the full phone record. Trump\u2019s critics have cherry-picked it to highlight the Biden content and twisted it out of context to make the case that the phone call was a criminal shakedown. But it was nothing of the sort.\n\nStart with the rationale for the call on July 25, in which the president congratulated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his party\u2019s July 21 parliamentary victory. Zelensky has much in common with Trump, being a former TV celebrity turned politician for whom the presidency is his entry-level job. The two obviously admire each other. And like Trump, Zelensky is a reformer; he said he \u201cwanted to drain the swamp here in our country.\u201d\n\nTrump asks Zelensky to look into 2016 interference\n\nThe change in government is important, because as Trump told Zelensky, the United States \u201chas been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d This was soon after the president spoke of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s \u201cincompetent performance\u201d before Congress the previous day, discussing the results of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump said \u201ca lot of it started with Ukraine.\u201d Trump mentions the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike, which investigated the 2016 hacking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers and was the first source of the story that the operation originated in Russia.\n\nThe FBI was denied physical access to the DNC\u2019s servers, and Trump told Zelensky that \u201cthey say Ukraine has it.\u201d Who \u201dthey\u201d are and how the server would wind up in Ukraine is certainly a mystery, but this was the topmost thing on the president\u2019s mind, the \u201cfavor\u201d he asked for. The favor had nothing to do with Biden.\n\nOUR VIEW: If Ukraine phone call 'was perfect,' why try to bury it?\n\nWe also learned Wednesday that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe into alleged ties between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the previous Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was somehow involved in trying to undermine the Trump campaign. Maybe Durham\u2019s team is the \u201cthey\u201d who mentioned the server. But this is why Trump expressed concern to Zelensky that he is \u201csurrounding (himself) with some of the same people,\u201d i.e. Poroshenko\u2019s deep-staters, and Trump\u2019s request to the Ukraine leader that he \u201chave the attorney general (William Barr) call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Zelensky said that he will, and that \u201call the investigations will be done openly and candidly.\u201d\n\nAnd it is Zelensky \u2014 not Trump \u2014 who brings up the name of Rudy Giuliani and proposes a meeting. This was after Giuliani had cancelled a trip to Ukraine in May to investigate whether the previous government had aided the Clinton campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s work in the country. He was also seeking more information on why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s questionable business dealings. This nongovernment mission was all very public and was reported in detail last May.\n\nBiden shouldn't be off the hook\n\nThis was how Biden\u2019s name came up. President Trump, fully aware of the canceled Giuliani trip, noted that \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution\u201d of his son, and \u201ca lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d He added, \u201cIt sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (Photo: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s definitely horrible for Biden. The former vice president brought this issue on himself, recounting in 2018 how he told Poroshenko years earlier to fire Shokin or forfeit a promised $1 billion U.S. loan.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: 'I\u2019m leaving in six hours,' \" Biden said at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations. \" 'If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.' \"\n\nThis was supposed to make Biden look like a tough customer apparently, but it raised the issue of conflict of interest, not to mention extortion. And they accuse President Trump of shakedown tactics? Please.\n\nMcMullin: If Congress doesn't stand up to Trump on Ukraine, his abuse of power will only escalate\n\nOne of the takeaways from the whistleblower complaint was that the phone record was kept highly secure, which implies it was meant to be kept secret. But given the fact that past records of presidential phone conversations have been leaked, this only seems prudent.\n\nAren\u2019t all such high-level records classified? The speed with which it was released shows that the White House felt it had nothing to hide. And acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire noted in testimony Thursday that much of what was in the complaint was hearsay. Other information was taken from open source news reports.\n\nFurthermore, the intelligence community inspector general found some signs that the whistleblower was tainted by political bias, which seems like an attempt to abuse the process. We will know more if and when the identity of the whistleblower is made public, which in a case of this magnitude it must be.\n\nThere is more to investigate with respect to Ukraine. For example, the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington confirmed that DNC contractors consulted with them for dirt on Trump in 2016. And what about other allegations of the Poroshenko government\u2019s efforts to help the Clinton campaign undermine Trump reported by Politico? The American people deserve to know.\n\nRegardless, the Ukraine flap has nothing to do with the 2020 election. Besides, the Democratic story line is invalid on its face. Biden\u2019s erratic behavior on the stump and rapidly imploding campaign shows he is no threat to President Trump enjoying a second term. If Sen. Elizabeth Warren can best Biden, Donald Trump hardly needs help from Kiev.\n\nJames S.
