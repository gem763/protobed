REUTERS/Grant Lee Neuenburg\n\nMAPUTO/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Mozambique\u2019s incumbent President Filipe Nyusi has taken an early lead in results from this week\u2019s presidential election but the main opposition party has questioned the results, stoking tensions just two months after a peace accord.\n\nWith around 39% of the votes counted from roughly 13 million registered voters, Nyusi has taken a lead securing 68.85%, while his main competitor Osuffo Momade of the Renamo party has racked up 26.20% of the vote so far.\n\nThe secretary general of Renamo, Andre Magibire, said the party was unhappy with the way Tuesday\u2019s presidential, legislative and provincial elections were carried out and that there had been \u201cmassive fraud\u201d.\n\nThe party held a press conference on Saturday and issued a statement accusing Frelimo of violating the country\u2019s fragile peace accord.\n\nThe poll was seen as make or break for the peace pact, which put a formal end to decades of hostility between Renamo and Frelimo.\n\nThe two fought on opposite sides of a civil war that ended in a truce in 1992, but have clashed sporadically in the years since.\n\nMagibire said Renamo would hold a meeting on Monday to decide its next steps.\n\nAfter casting his vote, Momade warned Nyusi not to manipulate the election results and said his party could not accept the outcome if it were rigged.\n\nFrelimo\u2019s spokesman Caifadine Manasse said elections were fair, free and transparent and would not affect the peace agreement.", "description": "Mozambique's incumbent President Filipe Nyusi has taken an early lead in results from this week's presidential election but the main opposition party has questioned the results, stoking tensions just two months after a peace accord.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442690798&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0DP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
