They could have had trials; they could have done whatever they wanted, but as usual, it\u2019s not reciprocal,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou know my favorite word, reciprocal. I don\u2019t want an edge; I just want reciprocal. And it\u2019s not reciprocal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fair deal for the United States,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFor national security purposes, Trump has fought against a Republican and Democrat political establishment and reduced refugee resettlement to the U.S. to its lowest levels since 1980.\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2020, Trump will cut former President Obama\u2019s refugee inflow by at least 80 percent by reducing the annual refugee resettlement ceiling to 18,000 admissions. This is merely a numerical limit and not a goal federal officials are supposed to reach.\n\nThe U.S. has permanently resettled more than 1.7 million foreign nationals and refugees through a variety of humanitarian programs \u2014 a foreign population larger than the size of Philadelphia, which has 1.5 million residents. This mass resettlement of refugees costs American taxpayers nearly $9 billion every five years.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
