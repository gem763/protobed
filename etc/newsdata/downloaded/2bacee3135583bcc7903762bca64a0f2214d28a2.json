It puts the death toll in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nAnkara reacted swiftly, rejecting the House\u2019s recognition as a \u201cmeaningless political step\u201d and warning it risks harming ties \u201cat an extremely fragile time\u201d for international and regional security.\n\n\u201cWe believe that American friends of Turkey who support the continuation of the alliance and friendly relations will question this grave mistake and those who are responsible will be judged by the conscience of the American people,\u201d Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn 2017, newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump criticized the early 20th century killings as \u201cone of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century,\u201d but in keeping with longstanding US practice, he stopped short of using the word genocide.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Never again\u2019 \u2013\n\nBefore being elected in 2008, Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama had pledged to recognize the genocide, but ultimately did not do so during his two terms in office.\n\nBut Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, delivered bold remarks to the House on Tuesday, saying the truth of the \u201cstaggering crime\u201d has been denied too often.\n\n\u201cToday, let us clearly state the facts on the floor of this House to be etched forever into the Congressional Record: the barbarism committed against the Armenian people was a genocide.\u201d\n\nThe House measure, which passed on Turkey\u2019s national day, came three weeks after Turkey invaded northeastern Syria and launched a broad assault on Kurdish-controlled areas that was made possible by the withdrawal of US troops.\n\nAngry US lawmakers launched a two-punch rebuke, with the genocide measure passing alongside a bill that slaps sanctions on Turkey for its incursion.\n\nThat bipartisan measure imposes sanctions on senior Turkish officials involved in the decision to launch the invasion and a Turkish bank with ties to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and requires the Trump administration to penalize Turkey\u2019s procurement of a Russian-made missile-defense system.\n\nA similar sanctions bill was introduced in the Senate, but no vote has been taken.\n\nIn the face of pressure, the Trump administration itself announced more modest punitive measures on Turkey for the invasion, before lifting them when it negotiated a ceasefire with Ankara.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic White House hopeful, praised the Armenia vote, tweeting that \u201cby acknowledging this genocide we honor the memory of its victims and vow: never again.\u201d\n\nIt was also welcomed outside the political realm. US television reality star Kim Kardashian, who has Armenian ancestry, tweeted about the vote to her 62 million followers.\n\n\u201cThis is personal for me, and millions of Armenians who descended from genocide survivors,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to estimates, there are between 500,000 and 1.5 million Americans of Armenian origin.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The US House of Representatives passed a resolution Tuesday officially recognizing the \u201cArmenian genocide,\u201d a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/6fcd88_house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-she-was-honored-join-her-colleagues-in-solemn-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
