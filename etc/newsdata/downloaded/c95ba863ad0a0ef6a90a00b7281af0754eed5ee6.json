We talked about both in the first 10 minutes. I didn\u2019t think there was going to be a second episode.\n\nJohn Wells (executive producer) Not many people thought it was the right time for a political drama. It was around the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. I think the scandal ended up being very useful, because we could remind the audience of what kind of integrity should be expected of our leaders.\n\nRichard Schiff (communications director Toby Ziegler) When I auditioned, I saw Allison Janney sitting there. I thought: \u201cOh my God, if they cast her, these guys know what they\u2019re doing. But they\u2019ll never be smart enough to.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The cast were like my family\u2019 \u2026 Allison Janney as CJ. Photograph: Danny Feld/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images\n\nAllison Janney (press secretary CJ Cregg) I kept seeing Richard at my callbacks. Neither of us thought we\u2019d get the roles. I wasn\u2019t even sure I was ever going to do television. So to then get the part was mind-blowing. These people almost became more my family than my family.\n\nWells We were already picking a difficult subject. Then NBC started worrying that the cast weren\u2019t attractive enough. Would viewers want to see these people? It is useful in those conversations to have a movie star like Rob Lowe [deputy comms director Sam Seaborn] on board.\n\nStockard Channing (First Lady Abbey Bartlet) I was about to go on a five-day hiking trip in a remote part of Canada when I got the call offering me a part. I had to get straight on a plane to Los Angeles. So I arrived there in full hiking gear and boots. It was 95 degrees and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, other than I had to wear an evening gown, which scared the crap out of me.\n\nWells Martin Sheen was only partially interested to begin with. We told him Jed Bartlet would only be in six episodes. Then, after the pilot, everybody wanted Martin in every episode.\n\nChanning I had never met Martin before. When I arrived for the first shoot, he was outside this mansion in white tie having a cigarette break with 500 extras all dressed up. Just before our first take, I said: \u201cHi, so how long have we been married?\u201d He said: \u201cOh, I think 25, 30 years.\u201d Then they said: \u201cAction!\u201d After take one, he said: \u201cAnd we have a grandchild!\u201d \u201cA grandchild?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you mean we have a grandchild?\u201d And they called \u201cAction!\u201d The days were like that.\n\nLily Tomlin (executive assistant Deborah Fiderer) Martin is a darling man. Before every scene, he would take off his real wedding ring, bless it and put it in a drawer.\n\nRacist mail\n\nDul\u00e9 Hill (the president\u2019s personal aide, Charlie Young) I only had a month and a half of rent money left when I got the job. The NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) had had an issue with the whole cast on the show being white. Thankfully, they spoke up, thankfully the entire team understood, and thankfully they made some changes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Controversy \u2026 the affair between Zoey and Charlie prompted hate mail. Photograph: Chris Haston/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images\n\nSorkin After an episode in the first season where Zoey Bartlet (the president\u2019s daughter, played by Elisabeth Moss) kissed Charlie, I got a letter from an outraged woman that read: \u201cLincoln only meant to free them \u2013 he didn\u2019t mean to glorify them.\u201d I went back and forth about whether to show it to Dul\u00e9. It felt wrong not to, so I took the letter to his trailer. He taped it on the wall. It was the first of many.\n\nHill I can vividly recall Aaron reading those letters out loud at read-throughs. It was like Zoey was the real president\u2019s daughter. The idea that people could respond that way really shocked me.\n\nSorkin I already knew there would be an assassination attempt at the end of the first season, but the hate mail gave me an idea: they weren\u2019t shooting at Bartlet \u2013 they were shooting at Charlie.\n\nThe 9/11 quandary\n\nChanning I was on the set early on 9/11. I was in the makeup trailer and they had the TV on when the Washington stuff happened. Everyone was sent home. Everyone was hysterical.\n\nSorkin The next day, I asked NBC to postpone our season three premiere indefinitely. Josh and Donna flirting, CJ fretting over her role in the cover-up of the president\u2019s multiple sclerosis, Bartlet\u2019s re-election campaign \u2013 it would all seem such small potatoes if it wasn\u2019t set against the same backdrop the rest of us were living through. The network wasn\u2019t able to, so I wrote the standalone episode Isaac and Ishmael. We didn\u2019t mention 9/11 or Bin Laden, but there was a sense something terrible had happened. Looking back, I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Eighteen years on, I still don\u2019t have any better ideas.\n\nJoshua Malina (Will Bailey, various positions) It\u2019s a bold piece of television that addressed a national tragedy in a matter of weeks. And a lot of adults today say: \u201cI was young when it came out and it explained a lot to me.\u201d\n\nChanning After 9/11, security was tightened up at the studio. There were metal detectors to scan under the cars.\n\nPranks and parties\n\nSorkin Brad Whitford (deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman) and Dul\u00e9 enjoyed a practical joke, but when Joshua Malina joined, all bets were off.\n\nHill Joshua once put a whole bunch of West Wing memorabilia in the trunk of Brad\u2019s car, then security stopped him on the way out.\n\nMalina It was low-level humour: leaving a piece of fish hidden in Allison\u2019s trailer, an onion here and there, tweaking the Post-its Brad would put up in his trailer to say: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the camera actually takes off weight.\u201d\n\nSchiff I was the worst offender of the giggle fit. My losing it usually had to do with Martin flubbing a line. The president\u2019s first scene \u2013 where he comes in and says, \u2018I am the Lord our God\u2019 \u2013 was this grand, beautiful entrance. He walked round the room, then tells the Christian right to get their fat asses out of his White House. He has a clown side: between every take, he would go to the catering table and stuff his face with chicken. There\u2019d be people trying to do his touch-ups and both his cheeks were full and he had grease all over his mouth. I\u2019d have to run to the next room to let out the laughter.\n\nJanney Once Richard started laughing, it was trouble. Sometimes, on Air Force One, I would say, \u201cCome on, it\u2019s always a smooth ride. Let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s bumpy!\u201d So Richard and I would act like there was turbulence, which would set us off.\n\nSchiff On Friday nights, we\u2019d all get giddy. One Friday, it was Allison\u2019s birthday and all of her friends came to the trailer. She showed off her lip-syncing talent and we all got involved with air guitars and air drums. Aaron came over at two in the morning to listen. That\u2019s how CJ ended up lip-syncing to The Jackal in one episode.\n\nWhitford When we were doing the Christmas episode in the second year, Yo-Yo Ma walked into a room full of hundreds of extras and wanted us to hold and touch and play his $6m cello. In between takes, he started improvising and Dul\u00e9 \u2013 who is one of the best tap-dancers in the world \u2013 started tapping along.\n\nPrince Andrew pops by\n\nSorkin The most surreal moment involved Prince Andrew. He was in LA and he\u2019d requested a tour of our set, so the British consulate set it up. In one part of the West Wing, the walls are decorated with framed photos of the president with world leaders and heads of state \u2013 the president with the pope etc. I was leading Prince Andrew down one of our hallways when I saw that he\u2019d stopped and was staring at a picture he couldn\u2019t figure out. It was Martin Sheen as President Bartlet engaged in a conversation with the prince\u2019s mother, the Queen. I got to tell him what Photoshop is.\n\nSorkin\u2019s departure\n\nSorkin West Wing scripts weren\u2019t finished \u2013 they were confiscated. Tommy Schlamme (executive producer) would come into my office and say: \u201cPencils down.\u201d\n\nSchiff I wanted Toby to be someone who didn\u2019t speak unless he had to. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever experienced an actor who didn\u2019t want more lines.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ready for a tap dance \u2026 Martin Sheen, Yo-Yo Ma and the $6m cello. Photograph: Warner Bros TV/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nJanney Aaron did an amazing job writing for women. He\u2019s had a bad rap for that \u2013 and I think it\u2019s unfair. The Women of Qumar was a key episode. I loved it any time CJ spoke truth to power or dressed down a four-star general. I long to be like that in real life.\n\nSchiff Towards the end of his tenure, Aaron was late with scripts. Sometimes we wouldn\u2019t be able to shoot. And that\u2019s expensive. The pressure of becoming a factory is tough.\n\nMalina When I learned Aaron was leaving, my jaw was on the floor. It was such a bomb. I remember Richard\u2019s voice breaking.\n\nWhitford I cried like a baby.\n\nJanney It felt like our parents were telling us they no longer wanted to be our parents.\n\nWells I didn\u2019t want Aaron to go but he was exhausted. Taking over was daunting. I called him and said: \u201cWhat was going to happen next? Because I have to write the second part of this two-parter after Zoey got kidnapped.\u201d He said: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The show died with him \u2026 John Spencer, centre, with Martin Sheen and Lily Tomlin. Photograph: Mitch Haddad/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images\n\nPatriotism reclaimed\n\nSorkin In popular culture, our leaders, by and large, are portrayed as either Machiavellian or dolts. I wanted our characters to be competent and committed, like the doctors and nurses on hospital shows and the detectives on crime shows. I wanted the show to be romantic and idealistic, but also quietly subversive. For an hour every week, I wanted to reclaim the word \u201cpatriotism\u201d.\n\nSchiff The first time we got invited to the correspondents\u2019 dinner in Washington DC, it was like Elvis had come back to Memphis! We were surrounded by hundreds of reporters, congressmen, senators and ambassadors who couldn\u2019t get enough of us. I missed a private meeting with President Clinton because I couldn\u2019t get through the crowd.\n\nJanney People would say \u201cMr President! Mr President!\u201d and Martin would put up his fingers in a peace sign like Nixon.\n\nChanning I remember getting on a plane to Washington with Martin and people were like: \u201cWe admire you so much.\u201d I was like: \u201cYou don\u2019t know me! You admire Abigail Bartlet.\u201d\n\nHill They gave us a real motorcade in DC one time. For me and most of the cast, it was really exciting. Martin didn\u2019t like it at all. He thought we needed to never forget we were actors.\n\nTomlin In the last episode, when Matt Santos (Jimmy Smits) is about to take over as president, I cried.\n\nWells Our political consultants all said a \u201cminority president\u201d was much more likely to be elected before a woman was. People started mentioning this extraordinary junior senator from Illinois. So Santos was modelled on Obama before Obama was Obama \u2013 and that made us look really good.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prescience \u2026 Jimmy Smits, whose character became president, with then senator Barack Obama in 2005, three years before he was elected. Photograph: Chris Greenberg/Getty\n\nSchiff In 2007, I was out campaigning. I\u2019d be surrounded by 300 Obama foot soldiers at each stop in the caucus states. They would say: \u201cYou\u2019re the reason we\u2019re here.\u201d And when you look back at that election, the difference was in those states. Maybe these foot soldiers, who were there because of The West Wing, are the reason Obama pulled off that primary victory and became president. That\u2019s pretty awesome.\n\nThe end\n\nWells John Spencer [chief of staff Leo McGarry] died just before Christmas in 2005. He was the glue that held us together. His sudden death came just as we were trying to decide whether to continue. We were all grieving and it seemed the appropriate time to end it. We could have done several more years, but sometimes something happens and the heart goes out of it.\n\nWhitford People used to ask: \u201cCould you make this show about a Republican administration?\u201d I always say no: a) because Republicans aren\u2019t sexy or funny; and b) you could never have characters high-fiving and saying, \u201cWe got a tax cut for the 1%! We\u2019ve got migrant children in cages!\u201d\n\nWells The last day on set, they used these little mini-bulldozers to tear everything down, which was particularly brutal. They saved the Oval Office though. Within weeks, it had been turned into the Ocean\u2019s Thirteen casino.\n\n\u2022 The West Wing is available on Sky Atlantic.
