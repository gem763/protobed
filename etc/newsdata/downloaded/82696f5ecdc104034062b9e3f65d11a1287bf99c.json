Protesters have expanded their demands to include complete withdrawal of the proposal, a concession her administration has so far refused. Large demonstrations wracked the city again over the weekend.\n\n'Serve two masters'\n\nLam suggested that Beijing had not yet reached a turning point. She said Beijing had not imposed any deadline for ending the crisis ahead of National Day celebrations scheduled for October 1. And she said China had \"absolutely no plan\" to deploy People's Liberation Army troops on Hong Kong streets. World leaders have been closely watching whether China will send in the military to quell the protests, as it did a generation ago in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing.\n\nLam noted, however, that she had few options once an issue had been elevated \"to a national level\" \u2014 a reference to the leadership in Beijing \u2014 \"to a sort of sovereignty and security level, let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented tension between the two big economies in the world.\"\n\nAn anti-extradition bill protester shouts and gestures during a protest, outside Mong Kok police station in Hong Kong Monday.

A 24-minute recording of her remarks was obtained by Reuters. The meeting was one of a number of \"closed-door sessions\" that Lam said she has been doing \"with people from all walks of life\" in Hong Kong.\n\nResponding to Reuters, a spokesperson for Lam said she attended two events last week that included businesspeople, and that both were effectively private. \"We are therefore not in a position to comment on what the chief executive has said at those events,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nChina's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, a high-level agency under China's cabinet, the State Council, did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters.\n\nChina's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests mark the biggest popular challenge to the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. Xi is also grappling with an escalating strategic rivalry with the United States and a slowing economy. Tensions have risen as the world's two biggest economies are embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war.\n\nLam's remarks are consistent with a Reuters report published on Friday that revealed how leaders in Beijing are effectively calling the shots on handling the crisis in Hong Kong. The Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\n'The price would be too huge'\n\nAsked about the report, China's Foreign Ministry said that the central government \"supports, respects and understands\" Lam's decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, denounced it as \"fake.\"\n\nAs protests escalated, Lam suspended the bill on June 15. Several weeks later, on July 9, she announced that it was \"dead.\" That failed to mollify the protesters, who expanded their demands to include an inquiry into police violence and democratic reform. Many have also called for an end to what they see as meddling by Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong.\n\nPeople take part in a general strike at Tamar Park in front of the government buildings in Hong Kong Monday.

At times, she can be heard choking up as she reveals the personal impact of the three-month crisis.\n\n\"For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,\" she said.\n\nLam told the meeting that the leadership in Beijing was aware of the potential damage to China's reputation that would arise from sending troops into Hong Kong to quell the protests.\n\n\"They know that the price would be too huge to pay,\" she said.\n\n\"They care about the country's international profile,\" she said. \"It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile and to have some say, not only being a big economy but a responsible big economy, so to forsake all those positive developments is clearly not on their agenda.\"\n\nBut she said China was \"willing to play long\" to ride out the unrest, even if it meant economic pain for the city, including a drop in tourism and losing out on capital inflows such as initial public offerings.\n\n'Biggest sadness'\n\nWhile Lam said that now was not the time for \"self-pity,\" she spoke about her profound frustration with not being able \"to reduce the pressure on my frontline police officers,\" or to provide a political solution to \"pacify the large number of peaceful protesters who are so angry with the government, with me in particular.\"\n\nHer inability \"to offer a political situation in order to relieve the tension,\" she said, was the source of her \"biggest sadness.\"\n\nAfter enjoying relatively high popularity in the initial part of her tenure, Lam is now the least popular of any of the four leaders who have run Hong Kong since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, according to veteran pollster Robert Chung, who runs the Public Opinion Research Institute.\n\nAt the meeting last week, Lam said the extradition bill was her doing and was meant to \"plug legal loopholes in Hong Kong's system.\"\n\n\"This is not something instructed, coerced by the central government,\" she said.\n\nShe expressed deep regrets about her push to pass the bill. \"This has proven to be very unwise given the circumstances,\" she said. \"And this huge degree of fear and anxiety amongst people of Hong Kong vis-\u00e0-vis the mainland of China, which we were not sensitive enough to feel and grasp.\"\n\nShe gave her audience a gloomy outlook. The police, she said, would continue to arrest those responsible for \"this escalating violence,\" a group that the government initially estimated numbered between 1,000 and 2,000.\n\nIt would be \"naive,\" she said, to \"paint you a rosy picture that things will be fine.\" She did, however, express hope in the city's ultimate \"resurrection.\"\n\n\"Hong Kong is not dead yet. Maybe she is very, very sick, but she is not dead yet,\" she said.", "description": "Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she has caused \"unforgivable havoc\" by igniting the political crisis engulfing the city and would quit if she had a choice, according to an audio recording of remarks she made last week to a group of businesspeople.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268011.1567447279!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hongkong-protests-carrielam.jpg"}
