Choo choo! Per figures provided by EW, the film won the U.S. box office over the weekend, taking in a jolly good $31 million and exceeding studio expectations. Starring Michelle Dockery, Maggie Smith, Elizabeth McGovern, and the rest of the Downton gang, the film reunites us with the Crawley clan in 1927, with the main action being the king and queen coming to the estate for an overnight visit. There\u2019s also a lot of poignant Dowager Countess moments, as well as, obviously, a B plot about an inheritance battle royale. Following Downton at the box office was Brad Pitt\u2019s sexy space drama, Ad Astra, with $19.2 million, and Sylvester Stallone\u2019s Rambo: Last Blood with $19 million. Neither of those films had a substantial tiara and/or wig budget. Coincidence?", "description": "The Downton Abbey movie has won the box office in the U.S. over the weekend.
