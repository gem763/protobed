We have ridden our luck and been bailed out by some fantastic attacking play.\n\nOur forward unit on any given day is 8/10 or 9/10 because Harry Kane guarantees goals, Raheem Sterling guarantees creativity and goals, and with Tammy Abraham and Callum Wilson, we have a very good pool of strikers.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThrow in our attack-minded midfielders and we have quality in abundance going forward.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much where we\u2019ve done the damage recently and because of that we have been getting away with it, arguably since the World Cup.\n\nThe midfield remains a bit of a concern \u00adbecause the one thing England haven\u2019t had is a player who can start on the halfway line, go past two or three opponents and turn defence quickly into attack. It remains to be seen if Leicester City\u2019s James Maddison can be that man, and I\u2019m not going to judge Mason Mount on Friday. Mount was asked to play as a No.10 and that\u2019s not where he plays for Chelsea.\n\nHe could \u00addevelop into the role but he reminds me of his club boss Frank Lampard during his playing days, someone who arrives in the right place at the right time rather than someone who will pick the ball up and waltz through a team like Paul Gascoigne. The midfield, therefore, is a 7/10 \u2013 not bad, but with room for improvement. The \u00addefence, however, is the issue. Only a \u00adtactical shift to three central \u00addefenders and wing-backs will resolve it.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIf Liverpool, as champions of Europe and with arguably the best defence in world football, have a back five including Alisson, when fit, that is 9/10, England\u2019s is a 5.5 or 6.\n\nHarry Maguire didn\u2019t automatically become world class when Manchester United paid \u00a380million for him. He\u2019s a very good defender but not great.\n\nGoalkeeper Jordan Pickford needs to talk more, and be more \u00addominant in his area.\n\nWe also need to get the right personnel around them, too.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAnd that means \u00adacknowledging we are not as good defensively as we think we are. It is why, in Bulgaria \u00adon Monday, I would like to see Gareth Southgate revert to a system with three centre-backs, one he practised when he first took over.\n\nBulgaria showed us at Wembley that they are not a good side, but we need to get used to the playing the system for when we take on stronger opponents.\n\nSo I would start with: Pickford, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Maguire, Tyrone Mings, Ben Chilwell, Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Mount, Sterling and Kane. And if we sort it out the formation won\u2019t be far off.\n\nIf we leave it as it is, though, then we could have the same outcome as Friday, or worse when we face France, Italy, Spain or Germany.\n\nEven against poorer teams, we have had spells when they have looked like they can score.\n\nMost European teams, whether it be Croatia in the World Cup semis or Kosovo and Czech Republic, tend to have 10 or 15 minutes in a game where they dovetail in a way we just don\u2019t and that needs fixing as well.\n\nWe need to make sure we\u2019re solid enough to cope with those periods and in Prague we showed we aren\u2019t.\n\nCzech Republic aren\u2019t winning the Euros or the World Cup anytime, and neither are we unless we can overcome it.", "description": "England suffered their first qualifying defeat for 10 years when they lost to Czech Republic on Friday night", "authors": ["Stan Collymore", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563382.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Czech-Republic-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
