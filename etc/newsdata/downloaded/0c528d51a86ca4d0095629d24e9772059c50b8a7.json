This twist slows down and clarifies the letters \u201cLMNOP\u201d that most sing as \u201celemenopee.\u201d This version also changes the original song\u2019s melody once those letters are sung.\n\nThe creator of Dream English, a musician, songwriter and teacher who goes by the name Matt R., said on his YouTube channel that he teaches \u201cyoung learners of English as a foreign language, and have found this way [is] the most effective for teaching the letters.\u201d\n\nDream English\u2019s \u201cAlphabet Song\u201d is featured in numerous videos on its YouTube channel, including a chant and playful variations. The channel also features plenty of videos with the original \u201cAlphabet Song\u201d as well.\n\nYet, despite the new version\u2019s good intentions, when a Twitter user posted it on the social media site Friday, most people despised it.\n\nThey changed the ABC song to clarify the LMNOP part, and it is life ruining. pic.twitter.com/TnZL8VutnW \u2014 Noah Garfinkel (@NoahGarfinkel) October 26, 2019\n\nTo see their reactions, just scroll down.\n\nHopefully they are pic.twitter.com/yVjbHoRXOK \u2014 Will Presti (@WillPresti) October 26, 2019\n\npic.twitter.com/AJ5KVpYbFz \u2014 Equal Parts Panic and Stupor (@unnamednpc) October 26, 2019\n\nThat was disgusting \u2014 Queen CANNON BUSTER (@SerRenemi) October 27, 2019\n\nthis does not slap in the slightest \u2014 beth mccoll (@imteddybless) October 26, 2019\n\nthis hurt my ears pic.twitter.com/Pkf0WZFd8S \u2014 emma \u2661 (@dayamarching) October 26, 2019\n\nif these new age kids don\u2019t say \u201cELLEMINOHPEE\u201d like the rest of us \u2014 \ud835\udd98\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd90\ud835\udd9e \ud835\udd87\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd90 \ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd8a \ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd77 (@kameroncarter) October 27, 2019\n\nThat legit made my ears bleed. \u2014 Barbara, This Is Shirley (@lenetra806) October 26, 2019\n\nBig Bird does the WHOLE DAMN THING faster than LMNOP, and generations of kids have turned out just fine. pic.twitter.com/61gFQwEccY \u2014 \ud83c\udf0e(((Jay Lender)))\ud83c\udf0e (@JayLender1) October 26, 2019\n\nI SING THE ALPHABET SONG A FEW DOZEN TIMES A DAY.
