So says FS1 personality and Fox Sports Radio host Colin Cowherd, who thinks the Los Angeles Chargers running back needs to drastically alter his holdout because he\u2019s losing money.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Chargers appear to be just fine, based at least off of Week 1. The team is on the rise, especially after making the AFC Divisional round last season under head coach Anthony Lynn and are now 1-0 after a Week 1 win over the Indianapolis Colts. Cowherd thinks that for the sake of Gordon\u2019s bank account, the player needs to end his holdout.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowl running back is seeking a new long-term deal from the Chargers. His bargaining position isn\u2019t quite as strong as he perhaps thought it might be when the holdout started this summer.\n\nOn Sunday, the Chargers win was punctuated by a big afternoon from Austin Ekeler. Gordon wasn\u2019t missed as Ekeler stepped forward; the third-year running back had 154 total yards and three touchdowns.\n\n\u201cMelvin Gordon, I love you. You\u2019re a good guy. But this is not a good holdout, fire your agent. This is not a good holdout. The Chargers have Ekeler and Justin Jackson and Ekeler is a dog, man. He can play. Yesterday he was unbelievable,\u201d Cowherd said during his show Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cListen, I like Melvin Gordon and I think he\u2019s going to come back. But he gave up money he\u2019s never going to get back.\u201d\n\nGordon\u2019s holdout continues as several start players have gotten mega deals in recent weeks.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys handed Ezekiel Elliott a six-year, $90 million contract extension after the running back held out from the team's training camp. This weekend, Julio Jones got his own deal -- a three-year, $66 million extension from the Atlanta Falcons where $64 million is guaranteed.\n\nGordon faces difficult circumstances in getting his own bigtime contract though.\n\nElliott is the cog that makes the Cowboys offense turn and Jones is one of the best wide receivers in the NFL. Gordon is certainly a top-tier running back but as Cowherd notes, he isn\u2019t in a position to make demands.\n\n\u201cAnthony Lynn is a power coach with a presence, they run the football well. Ekeler is a very high-end backup. A lot of time with these holdouts, it is your leverage,\u201d Cowherd said. \u201cWho\u2019s my backup? How much do they need me? Melvin Gordon is a good player. He\u2019s not for that offense and that position, a have-to-have to win lots of game. Melvin, come back -- you\u2019re a good player. But in this situation the longer you stay out, you\u2019re going to have less and less leverage.\u201d", "description": "FS1 personality Colin Cowherd said that Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon is hurting his earning power with a pointless holdout.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/melvin-gordon-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
