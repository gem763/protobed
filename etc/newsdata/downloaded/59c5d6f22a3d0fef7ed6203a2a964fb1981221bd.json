It\u2019s a character study determined to provide insight into the types of racist, sexist lunatics who spread fear and hatred via the barrel of a gun and, at least as a portrait of what makes these individuals tick, it\u2019s as timely as it is depressing\u2014and horrifying.\n\nBefore it heads down more contrived avenues that exacerbate its dearth of surprises, Cuck crafts an authentic vision of sexually aggrieved white nationalist psychosis. The crazy person in question is Ronnie (Zachary Ray Sherman), a California twentysomething who lives at home caring for his mom (Sally Kirkland, crowing like a prejudiced, pious loon) and, more frequently still, sitting in his dark bedroom, decorated with American flags and pamphlets for the military that won\u2019t let him in because he failed his psych test. Habitually situated shirtless in front of his laptop, pizza and soda always within reach, Ronnie watches online video after online video of right-wing commentators\u2014including his favorite star, Chance Dalmain (Travis Hammer)\u2014ranting about the dangers of liberalism, immigration and diversity.\n\n\u201cAre you ready to take the red pill? Or are you just another cuck?\u201d asks Chance at the end of one such screed. For viewers not familiar with this sort of language, he\u2019s using the terminology of the incel (\u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d) community, comprised of men who blame their lack of sex (and generally bad romantic fortunes) on women. The allusion to The Matrix\u2019s \u201cred pill\u201d speech refers to incels\u2019 belief that only they can see the truth: namely, that society is unfairly rigged against men like them, thanks to \u201cChads\u201d (i.e. handsome, wealthy studs) getting all the \u201cStacys\u201d (i.e. super-hot materialistic women), and all the \u201cBeckys\u201d (i.e. average women) coveting the \u201cChads\u201d rather than settling for them. It\u2019s an unhinged view of the world designed to put the onus for their failures on everyone and anyone but themselves.\n\nAnd as illustrated by Alek Minassian, a self-described \u201cIncel Rebellion\u201d member who in April 2018 ran a truck through a Toronto crowd, killing 10, it leads to the sort of domestic terrorism that\u2019s become all-too-common these days.\n\nRonnie is cut from this exact cloth, and when he\u2019s not endlessly indoctrinating himself with extremist videos or clips of naked women shooting firearms\u2014because part of this equation is the dream of joining the military to defend the country against brown-skinned \u201ccavemen\u201d\u2014he\u2019s pleasuring himself to free porn. Proving to be the very thing he claims \u201clibtards\u201d and \u201cfeminazis\u201d are, he\u2019s a hyper-sensitive \u201csnowflake\u201d or, per the film\u2019s title, a \u201ccuck\u201d\u2014a term that, to a woman who unwisely responds to his online-dating-site invitation, he misogynistically defines as \u201ca pussy.\u201d It\u2019s thus no surprise that his get-together with this stranger quickly falls apart. Or that the best he can do for employment is getting a job mopping floors for the Arab convenience store owners he resents. Or that he loses said gig almost as soon as he lands it, because he can\u2019t stop himself from spewing hate speech at, and getting into fights he can\u2019t win against, African-American customers.\n\nIn this regard, Cuck is incisive, affording a convincing peek into the life of the sort of friendless, sexless, still-living-in-his-mom\u2019s-house catastrophe that eventually takes his self-loathing and resentment out on the public at large. With every fit of pent-up fist-shaking fury, Sherman captures the volatility of such men. And in the online videos Ronnie begins uploading to the web\u2014regurgitating the agitprop he\u2019s consumed but doesn\u2019t really comprehend past its superficial intolerance and persecution-complex nonsense\u2014he conveys both the ugly anger that fuels him, and the underlying little-kid-lost loneliness and sorrow at the root of his emotional issues. The latter is only reinforced by Ronnie\u2019s memories of his late military-vet dad, here presented through impressionistic interludes of the man standing in the center of a spotlight in a dark space.\n\nThe problem with Lambert\u2019s film (co-written by Joe Varkle) is that after establishing its accurate snapshot of incel Ronnie, its only destination is a massacre. That alone renders Cuck\u2019s second half an exercise in waiting for the inevitable. Worse, however, is the means by which it brings that calamity about\u2014specifically, Ronnie\u2019s unlikely relationship with Candy (Monique Parent), a neighborhood cougar who turns out to be an internet porn star. Taking the bold step of offering to help with her yard work, Ronnie is quickly brought into her business, which she runs with intimidating heroin-addict spouse Bill (Timothy V. Murphy). Before long, he\u2019s making X-rated clips with Candy (supposedly to be accessible only behind a VIP subscriber paywall) in which he plays her cuckolded husband, forced to watch her have sex with black and Latino hunks while being berated as unmanly.\n\n\u201c This narrative twist certainly provides \u2018Cuck\u2019 with an opportunity to sexually humiliate Ronnie in the very way that will most wound his sense of self, but it does so at the expense of believability. \u201d\n\nThis narrative twist certainly provides Cuck with an opportunity to sexually humiliate Ronnie in the very way that will most wound his sense of self, but it does so at the expense of believability. It\u2019s simply too convenient for the unstable Ronnie to fall into this disaster-ready situation, which is compounded by his delusional fantasy that Candy really loves him (a notion she naturally exploits in order to keep him around). By the time he\u2019s being debased by Candy in the most emasculating manner imaginable, the film has lost any desire to play with expectations, to its own detriment.\n\nThrough a series of improbable third-act developments, Cuck orchestrates the tragedy it\u2019s been telegraphing from the start. Director Lambert stages it with a matter-of-factness that shrewdly undercuts any sense of excitement; like his camera\u2019s early serpentine trip through a laundromat ringing with foreign voices that drive Ronnie insane, his handling of the finale is restrained, and assured. By that point in the proceedings, though, his film has indulged in one too many expedient twists to feel like more than a two-dimensional big-screen version of a well-researched op-ed piece.", "description": "The new film \u201cCuck,\u201d in theaters Oct. 4, dramatizes an internet-radicalized, sexually frustrated white nationalist\u2019s descent into violence.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568412412/unnamed_9_qyipil", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
