In a statement, the UAW said the workers are striking over a number of issues, including wage increases and job security.\n\n\"One of the biggest issues for us is the job security,\" Walter Smith, president of the local representing Pennsylvania workers, told WCAU-TV. \"I've been here for 42 years at Mack Trucks, love working at Mack Trucks. But we need to have our job security.\"\n\n\u201cThe last 4 years we have helped Mack Truck make significant profit through our work. All we are asking is that the company treat us with the dignity and respect we deserve in making them successful.\u201d Doug Irvine, President of Local 2301 and President of the Mack Truck Council pic.twitter.com/lxBxCYvxZc \u2014 UAW (@UAW) October 13, 2019\n\nThe Mack Truck strike follows the decision by 46,000 General Motors workers to go on strike, a labor dispute that's now in its fourth week and is projected to have longer-term ramifications for the auto industry and organized labor. GM is losing an estimated $450 million a week, and the strike could ripple through the economy.\n\nMack Truck talks\n\nThe union said many issues are unresolved with Mack Truck's management, including wages, job security and pension and health benefits. Union officials say they will be available to reconvene negotiations Oct. 21, nine days after the beginning of picketing.\n\nMack Trucks President Martin Weissburg said he's \"surprised and disappointed\" that the union decided to walk out \"rather than to allow our employees to keep building trucks and engines while the parties continued to negotiate.\"\n\nWeissburg said in a statement that the two sides had been making progress and have a \"positive working relationship.\" He said the company had no plans to close any U.S. manufacturing facilities and had on the contrary invested hundreds of millions of dollars in them over the last decade.\n\nOfficials remain confident they can reach an agreement that \"provides a competitive wage and benefit package for our employees and families, and helps to ensure the company's competitiveness,\" he said.\n\nIn 1984, some 9,200 Mack Truck workers went on strike for nine days, closing the manufacturer's U.S. plants before a tentative agreement was reached, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported.", "description": "About 3,600 workers went on strike Sunday over issues including wage increases and job security", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/14/bfb074db-f950-402c-b5c0-b6127d1f7022/thumbnail/1200x630/d154f28efd9284bc2a829c39610764d7/rts1xmy2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
