Within a year, she\u2019s expanded to three branches. But her entrepreneurial journey wasn\u2019t straightforward. Much like the concept of her plant-based restaurant, her success came very organically. finweek sat down with her at her newest restaurant in Rosebank Mall.\n\nYou\u2019re not a chef by training. How did your food journey start?\n\nAfter finishing my graphic design degree, I started a job in the marketing department of a financial services group. I wanted to eventually become a creative director or start my own agency, because I always loved art and design.\n\nI hated being at a desk, so one of the outlets I had in my first year of working was starting a food blog. I couldn\u2019t cook at all. One of the only things I could make was brownies. So I ate out a lot, had tonnes of brownies and ended up gaining a bit of weight. My mother even told me I looked like a little bubble! That was the start of me becoming more health conscious. It wasn\u2019t revolutionary; I started making very small changes to my diet and shared some of the recipes I was using on my blog.\n\nThe more I cooked, the more I realised it\u2019s another form of creative outlet and I loved using unusual flavour combinations.\n\nHow did it develop from creative outlet to more?\n\nI changed jobs nearly once a year. I gained quite a bit of varied experience and moved up quite quickly as I moved companies. I didn\u2019t have a BCom degree, so I did a project management course at Wits and used that to leverage me into a position as marketing manager, where I could manage events and the marketing team. I loved it because I didn\u2019t have to be at a desk all day.\n\nAll along my food blog had been ticking over. By this time, I loved food and I was also doing freelance food styling and recipe development. The more I did this, the more I thought, \u201cI should do this\u201d.\n\nYears ago, a friend of mine and I thought of opening a little restaurant together, but it was a pipedream. At the time we thought we\u2019d need to save about R200 000 to make it happen. In hindsight that wouldn\u2019t even have paid for the kitchen.\n\nSo, a restaurant was always at the back of my mind, but it was a total dream.\n\nHow did you move into the restaurant space?\n\nThrough my freelance work, I started getting more restaurant clients, working on their social media strategy and also getting to know the kitchen processes. By that point I had also \u2013 not consciously \u2013 effectively gone vegan. I am more comfortable with the term plant-based now as I am far from a perfect vegan.\n\nAll these things just kind of came together and I eventually started working for a start-up meal kit company. I developed over 100 recipes for them. But I realised this was also not what I wanted to do \u2013 it wasn\u2019t creative and the recipes I was developing were not exclusively plant-based.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you give up the dream?\n\nI got a call from my now business partner, Ezio Nichele. He had gotten my details through a mutual friend. He was planning to open a vegan restaurant and needed a vegan chef. Initially, I wasn\u2019t sure about the idea, but I met up with him and it turned out that he had known my uncle for 15 years, and had even worked with him for a while, which already gave us a bit of a connection.\n\nHe had a concept already, but I was so sure Lexi\u2019s was the right idea for Joburg that I convinced him we should do that instead.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we partnered. We went in 50/50 \u2013 me with IP equity and Ezio with the financial capital.\n\nYour slogan is \u2018Eat more plants\u2019. Can you explain your menu?\n\nMy vision was to encourage healthy eating. To create a plant-based menu that is accessible and affordable in South Africa. Overseas everyone is doing it. South Africa is almost there, but not quite, specifically not Joburg.\n\nThe few vegan caf\u00e9s or restaurants that have been around for a while in Joburg have definitely started rippling waves of change, but I think Joburgers are starting to get more serious about their diets and realising sustainability is important, so there's a bigger gap now.\n\nVegan isn\u2019t our only pillar. That\u2019s why our menu works, because we still make a burger and fish, which makes it accessible.\n\nYou\u2019ve opened three restaurants in just over a year. Why do you think Lexi\u2019s has been so successful?\n\nWe\u2019ve been really lucky in the combination of our skillsets; Ezio from an operational point of view, and me on the food and design side. Lexi\u2019s Healthy Eatery works because the partnership works \u2013 and when we apply our different skills to the business, we always consult each other.\n\nObviously, being the \u2018first\u2019 to launch something like this really helped us in terms of building quick success \u2013 people are ready and keen for something fresh and different. We also made sure not to position ourselves as strictly vegan \u2013 it appeals to a bigger market because people just want to eat healthier and more consciously. In fact, only about 10% to 15% of our clients are even vegan.", "description": "Lexi Monzeglio has opened three restaurants in just over a year.
