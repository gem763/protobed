The FTSE 250 index .FTMC was up 0.2%.\n\nA sub-index of banks .FTNMX8350 broke its three-day losing streak with a 1.2% rise. CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said the Fed\u2019s signal to hold back on further cuts was probably not priced in.\n\n\u201cThe last thing that banks in particular want is further aggressive easing from central banks,\u201d Hewson said.\n\nCentral banks around the world have been loosening monetary policy to stem a slowdown in economic growth. The Fed cut rates for the second time this year but set a higher bar to any further reductions.\n\nThe BoE has said that underlying inflation pressures meant it was still likely to need to raise interest rates over the medium term, assuming there is no major Brexit disruption and a recovery in global economy.\n\n\u201cThe Bank of England will be very happy to just say we are not going to change rates for the time being ... there is no reason to do anything ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline,\u201d Hewson said.\n\nAmong stocks, Next (NXT.L) skidded 4.2% after it flagged that the first few weeks of the Autumn season were disappointing and Diageo (DGE.L) slipped 1.4% after it said it was \u201cnot immune\u201d to changes in global trade policies as it laid out targets for the year.\n\nJD Sports was also among biggest losers with a 2.5% drop after the British competition regulator announced its intention to refer the retailer\u2019s deal to buy Footasylum to a phase-2 investigation.\n\nBritish Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) gained 2% after a rating upgrade by Morgan Stanley, while auto catalyst maker Johnson Matthey (JMAT.L) rose by the same level following forward-looking comments.\n\nMidcap constituent IG Group (IGG.L) jumped 8% as it said client numbers grew thanks to favourable market conditions in August, while small cap Kier Group (KIE.L) lost 10.4% after the contractor posted an annual loss.\n\nInsurance services firm Charles Taylor (CTR.L) shot up by 37% with its share price topping the 315 pence a share go-private deal it has agreed with a firm backed by private equity firm Lovell Minnick Partners.", "description": "A rebound in bank stocks after the U.S. Federal Reserve's guarded stance on future interest rate cuts lifted London's FTSE 100 on Thursday, with investors shifting focus to the Bank of England's policy decision due later in the day.", "authors": ["Muvija M", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431523845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0HH", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
