The race began and ended in the Sambrodomo, the parade ground for the city's iconic Carnival.\n\nKipchoge, who won the London Marathon earlier this year in near world-record time, is just the second Kenyan man to win the gold medal in the Olympic marathon.\n\nMost of the race was run at about 5 minutes per mile. But when Kipchoge started to make his push, he quickly thinned out the large pack of other runners with miles at 4:45, 4:43, 4:41 and then the 21st mile in 4:35. That last mile separated him from everyone and effectively ended the race.\n\nEthiopia's Feyisa Lelisa finished second in 2:09:54 and American Galen Rupp, running just the second marathon of his life, took bronze in 2:10:05.\n\nRupp is the first U.S. runner to medal in the men's marathon since Meb Keflezighi in Athens in 2004. Rupp also finished fifth in the Olympic 10,000 meters in Rio and won a silver medal in that event in London four years ago.\n\nKeflezighi, 41, was back again for another marathon, but struggled in Sunday's race, stopping several times and finishing 33rd in 2:16:46.\n\nThe other American in the race, Jared Ward, finished 6th in 2:11:30, a personal best.\n\nRunning in his fourth and final Olympics, Keflezighi told NBC he actually had to stop and rest seven times during the race. He slipped on the wet surface just before the finish and then did a few push-ups before getting up and crossing the line.\n\nA week of stellar performances\n\nThe men's marathon on the final day of the Olympics wrapped up more than a week of outstanding performances by distance runners in Rio.\n\nEthiopian Almaz Ayana set a world record in the women's 10,000 meters by more than 14 seconds and followed that up with a bronze in the 5,000.\n\nMo Farah of Great Britain completed a historic double-double. When he crossed the finish line first in the 5,000 on Saturday night, he became just the second runner to win the 5,000 and 10,000 in back-to-back Olympics. Lasse Viren of Finland accomplished that feat in 1972 and 1976.\n\nRupp's bronze medal in the marathon also put a punctuation mark on a strong performance by American middle- and long-distance runners.\n\nMatt Centrowitz won the 1,500 meters on Saturday night, the first U.S. man to do that since 1908. Later on Saturday evening, Paul Chelimo was second in the 5,000, the first American to medal in that event since 1964.\n\nEarlier, Evan Jager and Emma Coburn won medals, silver and bronze respectively, in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Jager is the first U.S. man to medal in that event since 1984 and Coburn is the first American woman to ever take an Olympic medal in the steeplechase.\n\nJenny Simpson, who came from behind to finish third in the 1,500 meters, became the first American woman to medal in that race.\n\nAnd in the men's 800, Clayton Murphy surged down the home stretch to claim bronze, the first medal for the U.S. in 24 years.\n\nBut Kipchoge stole the show on Sunday.\n\nHe has now won seven of the eight marathons he's run. His winning time in London this April was 2:03:05, just eight seconds off the world record held by fellow Kenyan Dennis Kimetto.\n\nKipchoge has spoken about his desire to claim that record for himself, so he may target London again next year, or possibly one of the fast fall marathons this year, in Berlin or Chicago.\n\nHis victory in Rio gave the Kenyans a sweep of the marathons. Jemima Sumgong became the first Kenyan woman to win an Olympic marathon when she took gold last Sunday.", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge pulled away from a crowded field with about nine miles to go and finished more than a minute ahead of his nearest competitor on the streets of Rio.", "authors": ["Alex Ashlock"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/08/21/kipchoge-8-21-16_wide-b7c2858971bdf7c5b2f9414790976d2eab5ebe59.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2016-08-21"}
