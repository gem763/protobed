Solutions can only be found politically, that is to say through dialogue.\u201d\n\nPutting pressure on China over Hong Kong is an opportunity for leaders like Merkel to put relations with Beijing on a strong footing.\n\nBeijing\u2019s position is that Hong Kong is part of China \u2014 what happens there is Beijing\u2019s business alone. Even mild calls for restraint, such as that made by the EU in mid-August, are rejected by Beijing as \u201cunacceptable meddling\u201d in the country\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nSome in Europe would be happy to agree. With the German economy slumping, U.S. President Donald Trump escalating his trade war, and economic wobbles in China itself, it\u2019s tempting to put business ties ahead of a discussion about democratic values.\n\nNever mind the appeal made in an open letter by Joshua Wong and other pro-democracy activists for help in their struggle to maintain the city\u2019s freedoms and push for democracy.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that, if tensions diminish, there would be less need for calls on the Chinese government and Hong Kong authorities to adopt a conciliatory approach to the protesters.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam said she would formally withdraw the extradition law that launched this summer\u2019s unrest. The announcement \u2014 made just before Merkel embarked on a three-day tour of China \u2014 marked a change of approach after weeks of intransigence, one that could open the way to ending the increasingly violent confrontations.\n\nMoreover, intervention by either soldiers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army garrisoned in Hong Kong or paramilitary forces gathered just across the city\u2019s northern border now looks highly unlikely. Hong Kong\u2019s police force, though widely regarded as having reacted with unnecessary brutality to protesters, has not looked likely to lose control of the city streets.\n\nThis is not, however, a time to take the path of least resistance. Putting pressure on China over Hong Kong is not just the right thing to do. It\u2019s an opportunity for leaders like Merkel to put relations with Beijing on a strong footing. By standing up for European values, European leaders have a chance to further European interests.\n\nAs Hong Kong\u2019s protesters have shown, pressure can bring results when dealing with Beijing. Though the city\u2019s pro-democracy opposition has suffered various setbacks over the years, it has also registered some notable victories. A mass protest of 500,000 people in 2003 led to the withdrawal of a sedition law and the early resignation of the city\u2019s first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.\n\nIn 2012, a proposal to make patriotic national education compulsory in schools was withdrawn after protests by students and parents. And in 2017, the city\u2019s third chief executive, CY Leung, was so unpopular with the public at the end of his first term, he was apparently barred from standing for a second by Beijing.\n\nEuropean leaders should also note that for the protesters in Hong Kong, the dangers will not dissipate with the end of the tensions. Lam\u2019s about-face notwithstanding, in the long term, Beijing and its proxies in Hong Kong will likely respond to this summer\u2019s struggle with a determined push to accelerate the erosion of the city\u2019s freedoms.\n\nEuropean leaders should not shy from highlighting the damage that would follow if China takes a hard line on Hong Kong.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened after all in the aftermath of the 2014 Occupy movement, with stepped-up legal harassment of opposition figures. The arrest on August 30 of six leading activists, including one of the protest\u2019s leaders, Joshua Wong, suggests the push back has already begun.\n\nIn staking out its response, Europe has various cards it can play. It can highlight that, unlike the United States under Trump, the European Union is not fighting a trade war with China. While European countries share many of the U.S.\u2019s grievances over Chinese trade and business practices, it is interested in finding ways of working together that can benefit both sides.\n\nEurope has an opportunity to take advantage of the pressure from the U.S. to obtain goals of its own: an end to China\u2019s protectionism, intellectual property theft and other bad trade and business habits; a rollback of Chinese interference around the fringes of Europe; a halt to Beijing\u2019s efforts to unduly influence overseas Chinese communities; and assurances that Hong Kong will retain the freedoms promised in its Basic Law.\n\nEuropean leaders should not shy from highlighting the damage that would follow if China takes a hard line on Hong Kong, even if it doesn\u2019t deploy troops or paramilitary police. If, for example, Lam were to invoke the city\u2019s emergency regulations ordinance \u2014 a colonial era law giving the government draconian powers to detain people and suspend civil liberties \u2014 the city\u2019s role as a financial and trade hub would take a drastic hit.\n\nThey could also stress how pressuring companies to fall in line with China\u2019s political line, be that by shedding executives or investigating staff who had supported the protests on social media, as has happened at Cathay Pacific, can only further discourage European countries from accepting outbound Chinese investment\n\nChina would not welcome the pressure. Yet in their dealings with the country\u2019s rulers, European leaders have more room for maneuver than they often appear to believe. In Hong Kong, the protesters have forced Lam to compromise. Europe, too, has the opportunity to use its leverage to help end Hong Kong\u2019s conflict and preserve the region\u2019s unique place as an outpost of liberty and liberalism.\n\nSimon Cartledge is the author of \u201cA System Apart: Hong Kong\u2019s Political Economy from 1997 Until Now\u201d (Penguin, 2017).", "description": "The protesters have shown Beijing can be budged.
