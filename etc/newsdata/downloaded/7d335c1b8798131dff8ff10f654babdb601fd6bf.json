I never thought that such a thing would happen, but it can, as you have seen today.\u2019\n\nSouthampton found themselves 5-0 down at half-time and did little to stem the flow of goals after the break.\n\nThe remarkable game saw hat-tricks from Jamie Vardy and Ayoze Perez, with Ben Chilwell, Youri Tielemans and James Maddison all scoring as well.\n\nHasenhuttl admitted it will be difficult for his team to recover from the shocking defeat, admitting that his players lacked commitment.\n\n\u2018We made two changes and tried to have a second half without conceding a goal, but the two substitutes didn\u2019t make us more stabilised,\u2019 continued the Saints boss.\n\n\u2018How we worked against the ball was not committed enough and the opponent showed in every attacking situation how strong they are and we couldn\u2019t defend it.\n\n\u2018We must look on the players and how we stand up again. [It is] Not easy [to recover] but we have to stand up again and show a different face.\u2019\n\nThe Austrian remained calm for much of the post-match interview, but began to lose patience when he was asked if he was in a state of shock.\n\n\u2018When I stand there for 90 minutes and see one goal after the other and there was no chance to defend and every goal we conceded you must think that there is no team on the pitch, it is not really nice standing out there, if you ask me if I\u2019m shocked, what do you think?\u2019 Hasenhuttl raged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Brendan Rodgers reveals team talk that inspired Leicester\u2019s 9-0 destruction of Southampton\n\nMORE: Leicester make Premier League history with 9-0 walloping of Southampton", "description": "Ralph Hasenhuttl has apologised to Southampton fans and taken responsibility for his team's performance in a record-breaking 9-0 loss to Leicester City.
