It\u2019s a time of somber reflection at the Federal Aviation Administration, and we express our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives.\n\nAs FAA administrator, I assure the traveling public that the dedicated professionals at this agency will never rest in their unending mission to improve air safety.\n\nIt has never been safer to travel on a scheduled air carrier in the United States. The statistics show that time and again. Nevertheless, the tragic loss of 346 lives aboard Lion Air Flight 610 last year and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March underscore that the work of safety is never done.\n\nRecent reports on Lion Air Flight 610 from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee and the international Joint Authorities Technical Review panel, however, highlighted areas for improvement by regulators and industry in certification, maintenance, training and procedures.\n\nThe world\u2019s aviation community must maintain its focus on deepening its understanding of how human interaction affects the safety of the machines we fly. This will require regulators to work closely together to understand different viewpoints, reexamine long-held assumptions and agree on changes to achieve the next level of safety.\n\nWith very few exceptions, accidents occur as the result of a chain of events. Modern data sharing and safety management systems help identify and mitigate risks to break the accident chain before a safety incident occurs.\n\nOUR VIEW:5 questions for Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg\n\nBOEING CEO:We are taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max\n\nBut we must enhance the use of modern data sharing and safety management systems throughout the industry to generate actionable data that will enable even more proactive steps to mitigate risks.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy, but I am nonetheless encouraged. In the months since the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents, the world\u2019s aviation regulators have come together like never before to understand what went wrong and how to prevent tragedies like these in the future.\n\nThe FAA is fully committed to address all of the recommendations raised by investigators, including those that pertain to when, whether or how the 737 Max will return to service. As we have said repeatedly, the aircraft will fly only after we determine it is safe.\n\nThe FAA is committed to raising the bar for safety both in the United States and around the world. The traveling public \u2014 and the memory of those so recently lost \u2014 demands it.\n\nSteve Dickson is the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.", "description": "It's never been safer to travel on a scheduled U.S. air carrier, but the\u00a0loss\u00a0of 346 lives aboard Lion Air & Ethiopian Airlines\u00a0shows work isn't done.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/28/USAT/6ac33436-ce89-4a1b-9506-025812b34dc9-737Max.jpg?crop=1568,882,x0,y176&width=1273&height=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
