The attacks were carried out by drones with a range of almost 1,000 miles, and immediately escalated tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of being behind \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d The Iranians have long supported the Houthis in their ongoing conflict with Saudi Arabia, a close American ally, and American intelligence officials strongly suspect that Iranian technicians trained the Houthis to deploy missile-launching drones.\n\nThe Houthi attack on the Saudi refineries is perhaps best seen as the most recent development in what historian David Crist calls the 40-year \u201ctwilight war\u201d between Iran and the United States. Most experts see President Donald Trump\u2019s May 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 as the beginning of the most recent chapter of the conflict.", "description": "Once the ayatollah\u2019s theocracy took hold in Iran in 1979, its relationship with the U.S. went from good to awful overnight.
