My brother (60-plus) lives with Mom (80-plus) but does not pay rent. He pays for some groceries and makes her meals. When she is unable to move on her own due to surgery, he has stepped up and assisted her.\n\nMy sister controls Mom's finances and meds, and gives Mom a weekly allowance. She insists that my brother pay rent, but he does not work, just gets Social Security. She tried to get Mom into an assisted living facility, but Mom did not want to go.\n\nI think it is okay for him to live rent-free because otherwise we would need someone to ensure Mom gets meals and check on her multiple times per day. My sis is trying to update the condo and make sure my brother moves out as soon as Mom passes.\n\nMy sis is very controlling \u2014 she just went into Mom's bathroom and threw out a bunch of makeup and lotions without asking.\n\nI live out of state, but visit 1 to 3 times per year. How do other families manage aging parents?\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Arguing\n\nArguing: omg.\n\nYour brother deserves a medal, not this dismissive abuse from your sister.\n\nDoes she have any idea how draining it is to be a caregiver? And how hard it is to find a good one, and how expensive it is to pay one, and how nerve-racking it is at first to trust one? Presumably you would have said something if your brother were doing a bad job of caring for your mom. So, assuming his love and competence, you and your sister are getting care for your mother and copious amounts of peace of mind for next to nothing financially. Like, the change you find in the couch cushions. Have you looked at the price of elder care lately?\n\nAny new financial arrangements should be in your brother\u2019s favor, and the schedule for his post-Mom moveout a generous and compassionate one.\n\nAgain, this assumes your mom is well cared for. These situations can be complicated and messy, to put it mildly.\n\nThe way \u201cother families\u201d manage is of little relevance, because some other families absolutely and permanently shatter over this stuff as some members dump all the work on everyone else and others grab all the valuables. The stories would singe your eyebrows \u2014 and your sister\u2019s behavior might not rank among the worst, but she seems to be using all her runway to get there. Wheeling Mom out of the way to polish up the condo for her estate sale reveals an ambition to reach for the worst.\n\nThe families who grow closer through their parents\u2019 care do so by communicating freely, shouldering burdens ungrudgingly, finding other ways to chip in when they can\u2019t be present, and by expressing gratitude for those doing the toughest work.\n\nThey also take the time to give themselves a freaking clue how this all works, and therefore would recognize your brother\u2019s caregiving as a win-win-win scenario.\n\nSo please tell your brother how grateful you are, then show your sister some prices for assisted living and in-home care to prove what a blessing he is.\n\nConsider getting a geriatric social worker involved: eldercare.acl.gov.", "description": "She needs to know the cost of assisted living and embrace his act of love and devotion.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
