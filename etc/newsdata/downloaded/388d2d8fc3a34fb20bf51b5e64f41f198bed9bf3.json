Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 17/32 in price to yield 1.5393%, from 1.597% late on Wednesday.\n\n\"The big question for a lot of folks is whether this is the third slowdown since the financial crisis or are we now heading for a global recession?\" said Anujeet Sareen, a fixed income portfolio manager and global macro strategist for Brandywine Global. He added that his base case scenario was for a slowdown.\n\n\"The wild card in the pack is always Donald Trump and whatever he tweets next.\"\n\nAsian shares racked up losses earlier in the day. Japan's Nikkei stock index closed down 2%, its biggest one-day decline since Aug. 26.\n\n\"Risk aversion is broadly on the rise and that has been triggered by the weakness in U.S. manufacturing ISM data earlier this week,\" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole in London.\n\n\"The outperformance of the U.S. economy compared to other major economies has held the dollar and other risky assets up but that has changed this week.\"\n\nThe string of weak economic data has increased market expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates at its next policy meeting. Traders see a 98% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nBets on a rate cut could rise further if a U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday show weakness in the labor market.\n\nBrent crude futures were last down 1.1% to $57.06 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 1.6% to $51.81 per barrel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by David Randall Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)", "description": "Weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data weighed on global financial markets on Thursday, leaving world equity benchmarks bouncing in choppy trading and sending investors into safe-haven assets on expectations of further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
