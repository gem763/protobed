According to a backgrounder, the Liberals are aiming to charge an annual one-per-cent tax, modelling it on a similar measure already in place in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cIn every decision we make as your government, we will always put this country and its people first,\u201d Trudeau declared in his victory speech.\n\nBut the Liberals are heading back to Ottawa 13 members of parliament short of majority status in the 338-seat House of Commons. To pass legislation, a Liberal minority government will need to cobble together support from other parties.\n\nA possible (and perhaps even likely) partner for the Liberals is the NDP, which secured 24 seats in the election and whose platform also promised to fight real-estate speculation. Instead of an annual tax on foreign homeowners, the New Democrats and leader Jagmeet Singh pledged a 15-per-cent foreign buyer\u2019s tax on the sale of homes to non-Canadians or people who are not permanent residents.\n\nSingh in his concession speech said he had spoken to Trudeau and \u201clet him know that we\u2019ll be working hard on making sure we deliver the priorities that Canadians have.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cWe want to help Canadians be able to get a home that they can afford.\u201d\n\nNeither the Liberal nor NDP proposal may be enough to slam the brakes on a Canadian housing market that has continued to gain momentum. Home sales increased 15.5 per cent in September from a year earlier, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe vacancy tax will create a nuisance for mobile homeowners and will generate a modest revenue source for the government, but it is unlikely to have broader economic impacts,\u201d noted Rebekah Young, director of fiscal and provincial economics at the Bank of Nova Scotia. \u201cOtherwise, the leading party has so far resisted broader measures pitched by other parties that would further fuel price escalation. An NDP alliance would put welcomed pressure on accelerating supply side solutions but its broad-based foreign buyer\u2019s tax proposal warrants caution.\u201d\n\nThe Liberals\u2019 proposed vacancy tax received a cool reception from industry when it was announced in September. Now, however, the ambitions of the Liberals and NDP to do something about housing speculation, as well as their likely alliance, increases the probability of some kind of tax.\n\nTime may still be limited to implement a new tax. Analysts from Citi noted Tuesday that recent Canadian minority governments have fallen within an average of two years, sending voters back to the polls well ahead of the usual four-year run of a majority government.\n\nTrudeau also vowed to expand the first-time homebuyer incentive, a shared-equity mortgage with the government, to try to help would-be owners in hotter real estate markets such as the Greater Toronto and Vancouver areas.\n\nA Bank of Canada survey of senior loan officers released Tuesday found lower interest rates had prompted greater demand for mortgages in the third quarter. That demand, the survey found, is expected to ratchet up further in the fourth quarter, in part because of the government\u2019s first-time homebuyer incentive.\n\nThe Liberal platform\u2019s proposals \u201care only likely to add further fuel\u201d to housing prices at a time when the market has already been picking up steam, according to Toronto-Dominion Bank senior economist Brian DePratto.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is by and large limited to demand-related measures,\u201d he said in a note. \u201cSome parts of the Liberal platform, such as a one-per-cent annual foreign buyer vacancy/speculation tax (echoing B.C.\u2019s measures on this front), may help to moderate demand, but others appear set to stoke it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "New taxes for non-Canadian buyers supported by both Liberals and NDP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sold-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
