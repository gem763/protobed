It's good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments ...,\" Google said in a statement after the ruling.", "description": "Google won its fight against tougher \"right to be forgotten\" rules after Europe's top court said on Tuesday it does not have to remove links to sensitive personal data worldwide, rejecting a French demand.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4866947.1539800552!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mobile-apps-privacy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
