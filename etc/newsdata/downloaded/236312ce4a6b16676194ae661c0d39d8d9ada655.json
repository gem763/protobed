It is celebrated with mooncakes, gazing at the full moon and colorful lantern displays and falls on Friday this year.\n\nProtesters plan a series of lantern-carrying human chains and sit-ins at MTR shopping malls and on the city\u2019s scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.\n\nThere were brief scuffles, pushing and hair pulling, between pro-Beijing and anti-Hong Kong government supporters in the mall of the IFC, a prominent skyscraper on the newly reclaimed Central waterfront.
