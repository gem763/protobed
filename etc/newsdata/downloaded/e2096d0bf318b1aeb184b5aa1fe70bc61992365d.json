It created significant communication difficulty for the pilots flying the Airbus A330, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cockpit coffee spillage causes transatlantic flight diversion.

The smoke and the fumes did not result in injuries to any of the 11 crew or 326 passengers onboard.\n\nDiversions typically cost airlines between \u00a310,000 and \u00a380,000, depending on the size of the aircraft and where it is diverted to, according to the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nThe AAIB report found the 49-year-old captain had put his coffee cup on a tray table \u2013 where objects were \u201cvulnerable to being knocked over\u201d \u2013 despite Airbus recommending pilots use the cup holders provided.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Image of the type of coffee cup in the cockpit of an Airbus A330. Photograph: Universal News And Sport (Europe)\n\nThe AAIB said the small size of cups used by Condor \u201cgenerally discouraged\u201d use of the holders. Condor has responded to the incident by ensuring cup lids are provided on all flights, reminding pilots to be careful with liquids and supplying cups that are an appropriate size for cup holders.\n\nA spokeswoman for the airline, which is a subsidiary of Thomas Cook Group, said: \u201cFlight DE2116 from Frankfurt to Canc\u00fan on 6 February 2019 diverted to Shannon airport as a precautionary measure due to a minor amount of smoke in the cockpit after a liquid spillage.\n\n\u201cAfter the aircraft was fully inspected and repaired by our team of engineers, the flight continued via Manchester due to the legal operating hours of the crew. We have comprehensively investigated this incident and reviewed the procedures of liquids in the cockpit.\n\n\u201cOur crews were reminded of [the need for] careful handling as well as to use appropriate containers for their water or coffee. We apologise for any inconveniences the diversion might have caused to our guests.\u201d", "description": "Control panel was damaged during Condor flight after captain put cup on tray table", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a6a1f1d35ea44c4b2069a6a4dd270227613fc29/199_473_3163_1898/master/3163.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4e06f865804f029f48d9f6f756a8d01", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
