It\u2019s unsurprising then that he voiced disappointment in New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the organization for signing Antonio Brown hours after his saga with the Oakland Raiders officially ended.\n\nDungy spoke about the situation during a pre-game segment Sunday on Football Night in America, via NBC Sports.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"I coached 13 years as a head coach and every year my first message to the team was, \u2018We want to win the Super Bowl, yes, we want to be talented, but we have to be role models\u2019. These kids in our country look up to NFL players and coaches, and I really think this sent the wrong message.\"\n\nDungy did win a championship while coaching the Indianapolis Colts and did not put up with diva wide receivers. The Hall of Famer joins plenty of others who view the situation as a veteran wide receiver seemingly forcing his way off of two teams only to be rewarded with a roster spot on a title contender.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nDungy took direct issue with what he views as an owner supporting a player\u2019s poor behavior.\n\n\"I know coaches want to win but I\u2019m disappointed in Robert Kraft. I think at some point you say, \u2018Just as an organization, we are not going to do this.' \"\n\nFellow NBC analyst Rodney Harrison, a former Patriots safety who won two titles in New England, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by it, but also didn\u2019t agree with it.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs a Patriot, you have to sacrifice. You have to sacrifice finances, you have to sacrifice your stats, you have to sacrifice a lot of individual things. And that\u2019s the one thing that Antonio Brown has shown me, that he\u2019s not willing to sacrifice anything for anybody else besides himself.\u201d\n\nHost Mike Tirico may have put it best, though.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny. The reactions [are] like anything in the league: there\u2019s the Patriots and everyone else.\u201d\n\nBrown could not play for the Patriots in Week 1 \u2014 it went just fine in his absence \u2014 and can join the reigning champions for their lopsided week 2 match-up against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nNBC analyst and former Indianapolis Colts head coach Tony Dungy said he was 'disappointed' in Patriots owner Robert Kraft for signing Antonio Brown.
