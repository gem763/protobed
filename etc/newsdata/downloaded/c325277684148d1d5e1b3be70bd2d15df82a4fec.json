The Massachusetts senator went on to tell CBS News: \u201cI was pregnant, but nobody knew it. And then a couple of months later, when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck, and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nTwo retired teachers from the same school district, who worked there during the same time period, told CBS News that Warren would\u2019ve been a target for dismissal once she became pregnant\u2026\n\nIn addition, a June 21, 1972 Associated Press news article from the (N.J.) Herald News emerged on Monday, published one year after Warren left her teaching job. That story explained that \u201cpregnant teachers can no longer be automatically forced out of New Jersey\u2019s classrooms\u201d thanks to a State Division of Civil Rights ruling from the day before that overturned the practice.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mediaite.Com New-Details-Support-Elizabeth-Warrens-Claim-She-Was-Let-Go-From-Teaching-Job-For-Being-Pregnant"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
