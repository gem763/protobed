When it came time for Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, who hosted the award show in 2016 and 2017, respectively, to present on Sunday night, they were quick to express their displeasure with the decision.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well, how\u2019s the whole \u2018no-host\u2019 thing going?\u201d Colbert asked from the stage, adding, \u201cWhat a joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a dumb idea,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cSo stupid. You know what has a host? Applebee\u2019s has a host.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know who the real victims are here? It\u2019s us,\u201d the Late Show host said. \u201cHosting is the only thing we know how to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this show sucks!\u201d Kimmel chimed in as the two hosts continued to flatter each other\u2019s unique hosting skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sad. Hosts aren\u2019t optional,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWithout a host, who would read the words, \u2018You know my next guest from the hit series NCIS: New Orleans?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one would,\u201d Kimmel answered. \u201cWithout a host, who would sit behind a desk and pretend to be interested in Jason Bateman\u2019s vacation story?\u201d\n\nFinally, Colbert said that \u201cif we let this slide, the next thing you know, they\u2019ll start using Alexa to present the nominees.\u201d And with that, the Amazon robot handed the Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series to Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge.", "description": "\u201cWell, well, well, how's the whole \u2018no-host\u2019 thing going?\u201d Colbert said when he and Kimmel took the stage to present at this year\u2019s Emmy Awards.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1428,w_2538,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569202027/SC_bjyt0b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
