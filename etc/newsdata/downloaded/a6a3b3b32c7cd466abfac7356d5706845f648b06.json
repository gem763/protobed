The Paddington rail disaster they \u00adsurvived that frosty October morning 20 years ago today has not faded at all.\n\n\u201cI have a very vivid memory of every step,\u201d says Tony, and Jan nods, as they recall the tragedy that killed 31 and injured 600 when two trains collided.\n\nBut neither can remember smells \u2013 although Tony ended up doused in diesel \u2013 nor sounds. They wonder if it is their brains\u2019 way of protecting them from the full horror of their experience.\n\nThe pair did not know each other back then but met nine months later on a Paddington Survivors\u2019 Group minibus on the way to the inquiry into the crash.\n\nBoth were in a \u201cfragile state\u201d from PTSD, but they found comfort in each other, Tony offering to show Jan around Westminster Hall where the inquiry was held, she \u201cbuying him an ice cream\u201d \u2013 joyful, normal moments amid the pain.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe next week the divorcees met to chat \u201crail safety\u201d \u2013 but it was really a date. Not long afterwards, Tony invited Jan to his house and \u201cshe never left\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was extraordinary luck,\u201d says Tony. Their love story made headlines when they married on Valentine\u2019s Day 2004.\n\nIt seemed a fitting ending for a hero...\n\nTony was awarded a Certificate of Commendation by the Chief Constable for clambering from the wreckage at Ladbroke Grove, West London, to scale two carriage roofs and pull out 65 passengers. He was haunted by those so badly injured he couldn\u2019t help. His trauma forced him to quit his job at a computer firm, and attempts at shop work proved too overwhelming.\n\nBut following therapy, time and Jan\u2019s support \u2013 while she also continued to battle PTSD \u2013 he began volunteering as an emergency ambulance officer eight years ago.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\n\u201cAt Paddington I was very good at getting people out of the train, but I was not very good at keeping them alive afterwards,\u201d he says, as Jan, 68, gently berates his self-criticism.\n\n\u201cI had 65 people out before anyone turned up, but asked to get a lady out, stuck under a carriage, I said, \u2018I can\u2019t do it\u2019. That felt terrible. Another was a lady black from head to toe lying on the tracks. I had to walk away.\u201d\n\nThis earnest man says he knows his volunteering sounds \u201cbizarre\u201d given his experience and illness.\n\nTony, 67, says: \u201cI respond very well in emergency situations. I attend head-on crashes, drownings, suicide, shootings. On one occasion someone wanted to be held while they died.\u201d\n\nHe does this in Tasmania where they live for six months a year \u2013 the other six remaining in their bungalow near Wantage, Oxon. \u201cI relive everything for five hours, reprocessing thoughts as I\u2019ve been trained to do by a wonderful psychologist who helped with the PTSD. I feel more fulfilled now.\u201d\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nThis is the first time the couple has spoken publicly since their wedding.\n\nThey were heavily involved with the Survivors\u2019 Group, and for 10 years attended the memorial site every anniversary. But then they withdrew to make the most of their life together.\n\nThe tragedy involved a Thames Trains service to Bedwyn, Wilts, tearing through a red signal and smashing into the First Great Western express from \u00adCheltenham Spa, Glos, which the couple were on.\n\nThe inquiry that followed was critical of Thames Trains and Network Rail\u2019s predecessor, Railtrack.\n\nTony says: \u201cI\u2019ve let the anger go. We were still alive and I had a life I wanted to live. Life is a God-given gift, you have to get the most out of it.\u201d\n\nJan was on the way to her job at a pensions company on the day. She lost consciousness and came round to a scene \u201cfrom a horror set\u201d but was able to get out of the door.\n\nTony was in carriage E which tipped up in the air while H exploded. \u201cFirst of all I thought I was going to get crushed to death, then when the fireball hit I thought I was going to burn to death, and when the smoke came I thought I was going to choke to death,\u201d he says.\n\nHe explains basic rescue training he had been through during the threat of IRA bombings helped him save others.\n\nTony and Jan walked away with cuts and bruises, but the mental scars were inevitable. She tried to keep working after the crash but gave up, and the couple rely on their compensation.\n\nDoes Jan worry for Tony doing his paramedic work? No, is the answer. \u201cYou look after me and I look after you,\u201d she says, turning to her husband.\n\nCandles will be lit in memory of the 31 people who died in the tragedy on the 20th anniversary. A silence will be held at 8.10am at Ladbroke Grove followed by a service at St Helen's Church, North Kensington.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Tony and Jan Jasper both survived the crash, and found comfort in each other in the aftermath of the tragedy, which killed 31 and injured 600", "authors": ["Emily Retter", "Image", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20424508.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Jan-Vaughan-and-Tony-Jasper-Paddington-Railway-Disaster-Survivorsed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
