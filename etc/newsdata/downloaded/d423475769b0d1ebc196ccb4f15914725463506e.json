Have more nous. Be more streetwise. Little things. That is what is killing us.\n\n\u201cGoals don't just come from one striker. You can't pressure just one person. He needs service.\n\n\u201cHe needs support and people allowing him to get in to good positions and runners off him. It is a team thing, not just the attackers. We are not pointing fingers at anyone.\u201d\n\n(Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)\n\nBoss Bruce admits Newcastle are in a relegation fight, but says that is the same as the last few seasons.\n\nThe most worrying statistic for Newcastle is their lack of goals and creativity which leaves them vulnerable \u2013 despite pre-season talk of a more open playing style.\n\nLascelles said: \u201cWe have to look at ourselves and see what we can do different. Go for another goal, squeeze up and get more passes together?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe gave away a really sloppy goal against Wolves . I wish we had stayed in the game. We need to look at it this week to see how we can manage the game a bit more, to do something different to what we did.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to score but I only really care about three points.\n\n\u201cI am confident (they can improve). We have played some good stuff and we have quality in the team, but it is about playing together.\u201d\n\nBruce signed Andy Carroll on a free in the summer but he is injured, with Dwight Gayle coming back to fitness.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you look at the Premier League, two or three points separates 11 teams. I always classed ourselves as one of those ten or 11 teams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be a little bit more open. Is it a mentality thing? Possibly. But we have to try to change that mentality.\n\n\u201cYou can talk about changes (to the team), but I always thought if anyone was going to create anything, it was (Saint-Maximin) or Almiron. There\u2019s that conundrum that obviously I faced. Dwight was obviously available, but that\u2019s what we have at the minute.\u201d", "description": "The Brazilian has only found the net once since his arrival at St James' Park this summer for \u00a340 million", "authors": ["Simon Bird", "Image", "Reuters", "Newcastle United Via Getty Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741857.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Wolverhampton-Wanderers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
