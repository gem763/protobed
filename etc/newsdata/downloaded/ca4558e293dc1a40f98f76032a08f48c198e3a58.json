I didn't feel the need to. I asked him on the day of the game straight afterwards, after my press conference, what happened and he said he got a touch.\n\n'Clearly when you see it back from behind he gets a hand on his back. I know it is light. I'm not saying it is a definite penalty but it's not a dive.\n\nHudson-Odoi was booked for diving after VAR overturned original decision to give a penalty\n\n'Not sure if Sean had maybe watched it back and all the angles when he spoke because it wasn't a dive as such. If that becomes a dive you will start analysing every bit of contact. How much?\n\n'Was that enough to put Ashley Barnes on the floor, or not? Was that enough for Callum to go down or not?\n\n'That is the game. Those are the grey areas. I didn't think the whole \"in five or ten years this is where the game is going to go\" was probably the right nature for what turned out to be nowhere near a clear cut issue.'", "description": "Lampard has reiterated his support for Hudson-Odoi after he was booked for diving in the win over Burnley at the weekend and insisted there was no need to discuss the incident with the player.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20329596-0-image-a-4_1572359236489.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
