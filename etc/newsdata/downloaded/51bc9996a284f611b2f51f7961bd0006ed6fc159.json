But that\u2019s exactly what happened when the watch automatically made an emergency call after a routine afternoon went wrong.\n\nPrudenciano, 28, was hiking a mountain trail in a New Jersey county park with a companion, when the pair unexpectedly ran into trouble.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even explain it,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWe ended up just falling into a situation. It got dark and we couldn\u2019t find our way back.\u201d\n\nPrudenciano noted that they attempted to get back on track, but vines kept them from finding the trail. From there, things quickly became worse. Prudenciano\u2019s hiking partner slipped, \u201cand I ended up following after her,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cAt the time that we went down, we actually decided to slide to the bottom of this mountain to try to get off. And when we slid, we ended up on a cliff,\u201d he elaborated. He noted that he could not accurately say how high the cliff was, but that it was \u201clife or death.\u201d\n\nThe slide down to the cliff was a rough one: \u201cShe ended up holding onto a branch and dangling over [the ledge], and I ended up stopping before.\u201d\n\nUnbeknownst to the pair, that bumpy slide set off an emergency feature on Prudenciano\u2019s new watch, sending a message asking if he\u2019d taken a fall. \u201cI had absolutely no idea that this watch was even doing what it was doing,\u201d the hiker said.\n\nSince he did not reply to the message, the watch automatically called 911, leading to the couple\u2019s ultimate rescue.\n\nPrudenciano suffered lingering injuries from the incident, resulting in the use of a back brace, which makes it uncomfortable for him to sit for interviews. However, he\u2019s sharing his story in hopes it will help others who might not know that their devices have such safety features.\n\n\u201cI definitely didn\u2019t,\u201d he admitted.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "When James Prudenciano recently purchased an Apple Watch, he likely had no idea the device would save his life just days later.", "authors": ["Wendy Geller", "Writer", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/74gYBAFiLzvqvEPrHAkE8g--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMTM3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cea2a6b0-f6aa-11e9-afd7-1f5776b526b6", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
