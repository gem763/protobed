I think about it all enough without having intrusive questions thrown at me when I want to go out socially \u2014 how many more treatments, does it run in your family, how sick has it made you, what kind is it?\n\nIn fact, if I wanted to tell \"my truth\" (I don't) I'd say it's one of the best things that ever happened to me! I've handled it all well, and mostly alone except for a few close confidants who know details. It's taught me to see what really matters to me. It's brought back my natural self-confidence and boosted my creativity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what do I say when people want to engage me for 20 minutes about something NOT their business? This is no way to treat someone who might, say, be out and about on her best day that week.\n\n\u2014 Not a Hermit!\n\nNot a Hermit!: Great point. I\u2019ll be quick with my feelings: I\u2019m sorry; glad your treatment is going well; good for you!\n\nHere\u2019s a script that\u2019ll work if you\u2019re merciless with it:\n\n1. \u201cThank you for your concern.\u201d They may just be nosy, but you\u2019ll like humanity a whole lot better if you give it the benefit of the doubt and assume its best intentions.\n\nThen 2. \u201cIt\u2019s tiring to talk about, though.\u201d This clear boundary is about you, not them, and shows them how they can help you \u2014 without your having to specify, \u201cBy shutting up. Immediately.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen 3. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it up when I\u2019m ready.\u201d Think of this part as a little favor your today self does for your tomorrow self, when you run into this person again. It\u2019s also a huge, welcome assist to those trying to read your words and body language for clues about how to treat you during your illness.\n\nAD\n\nIn all fairness: That\u2019s not something people just automatically know, nor should they. One small-town cancer patient will come home annoyed that everyone asked about her cancer, and another will come home annoyed that no one asked about her cancer. It\u2019s personal, it\u2019s hard, we try.\n\nIf you can offer brief, honest, gratitude-oriented, not-too-aggravating-to-repeat instructions for concerned townspeople \u2014 your own words, if mine don\u2019t feel right \u2014 then soon you\u2019ll have no trouble leaving the house.\n\nAD\n\nDear Carolyn: I am severely disabled and have very limited energy. I have a \"friend\" who constantly wants to go to things with me and frequently asks what I'm doing. She is also disabled, but she has all the energy in the world and is frequently gone all day doing things with various groups.\n\nOften, I just don't have the energy, or the desire. I have a 14-year-old and a husband to care for as well. I try to tell her that, but she won't take no for an answer. Whatever I have wrong with me, she tries to tell me she has the same thing and how she just powers through it.\n\nAD\n\nI used to enjoy spending time with her occasionally, but now the pressure is getting more frequent and much less pleasant. It's hard for me to flat-out say no, I don't want to do that. Is there a nice way to discourage her and still have an occasional cup of coffee? Unfortunately, she's my neighbor.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: The nice way to discourage her and still have an occasional cup of coffee is to flat-out say no.\n\nI\u2019m sorry.\n\nBut if you were socialized to believe \u201cno\u201d is a dirty word, then you were given really bad information.\n\nSaying no is generous here because it gives your \u201cfriend\u201d clear instructions for securing your companionship. The alternative \u2014 what you \u201ctry\u201d to say \u2014 has left room for her to do over and over and over again something you find so obnoxious that you\u2019ve considered ending the friendship over it, without her even knowing she\u2019s crossed that line.\n\nAD\n\nThe true kindness is in giving her a chance.\n\nYou: \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not up for a day trip. I\u2019d love to have coffee, though.\u201d\n\nShe: [some form of pressure.]\n\nYou, kindly: \u201cPlease take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. When I want to say yes, I will say yes.\u201d\n\nAnd if needed: \u201cI am through discussing this.\u201d If she refuses to receive that message, then, alas, the air quotes around \u201cfriend\u201d are well-placed.\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.
