It also marked the 12th straight week that the number of high-end deals in Manhattan was below 20\u2014a threshold Ms. Olshan uses to denote a strong market.\n\n\n\nMore: The Allure of Owning an Australian Island\n\nMultimillion-dollar home deals have declined significantly since July 1, when New York state imposed a set of new transfer taxes on the city, including a new progressive mansion tax on homes over $2 million.\n\n\n\nOver the past three months, there have been 176 contracts signed for luxury homes, a 24% decline from the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\nThose homes that did find buyers are getting bigger price cuts than a year ago, as sellers try to compensate for the added closing costs. Luxury homes that went into contract since July 1 got an 11% discount compared to 8% in the same period last year, according to Olshan.\n\n\n\nThe total dollar volume of high-end deals has also plummeted since the tax went into effect. Luxury contracts over the last three months totaled $1.33 billion, nearly one-third less than the same period last year, when deals totaled $1.92 billion.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: The Designers Behind Badgley Mischka on Their Favorite Things at Home\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest deal last week was for an all-cash $27.5 million apartment at a historic co-op building overlooking the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 12-room apartment has four bedrooms and fireplaces. The uber-exclusive building doesn\u2019t permit mortgage financing.\n\nThe second-biggest deal of last week was a Chelsea townhouse asking $13.5 million, marking a massive discount from the $24.5 million the seller was asking when the home first hit the market in August 2016, according to the report.\n\nThe mini-compound includes a four-story house and a two-story carriage house, which is connected by a covered pathway, one of the few \u201chorse walks\u201d that still remain in the city.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-109867?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
