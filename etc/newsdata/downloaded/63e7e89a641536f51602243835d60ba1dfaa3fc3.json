England can secure their place at Euro 2020 with three matches to spare with victory in the Czech Republic next month. But Southgate admitted the individual mistakes that crept into the performance, following similar lapses against the Netherlands in the Nations League this summer, left major room for improvement.\n\nJadon Sancho the difference as blunders mar England\u2019s 5-3 win against Kosovo Read more\n\nMichael Keane gifted Kosovo the lead after just 34 seconds with a wayward pass and the visitors struck twice early in the second half having trailed 5-1 at the interval. Harry Kane also missed a penalty in a chaotic game illuminated by Sterling\u2019s brilliance and the first goals of Jadon Sancho\u2019s international career.\n\n\u201cIt was bizarre. The outstanding features and the poor features are apparent to everybody, so we don\u2019t need to get the video out and go back through it,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cPoor individual mistakes, a poor start to the game. I like the way we showed the composure to recover from that initial mistake and our use of the ball throughout the first half was excellent, right the way through the team.\n\n\u201cThe small period after half-time: ridiculous mistakes, poor decisions, lack of covering back. So, we made the game really uncomfortable for ourselves. There were obviously mistakes that were concerning. Whether it was the intensity of the game, whether it was the pressure, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got to reflect on that but they were such basic errors, really, that you have to learn from. We just made some crazy errors.\u201d\n\nEngland 5-3 Kosovo: player ratings from the Euro 2020 qualifier | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nBy contrast, England were formidable in attack with Sterling scoring once, providing three assists and hitting a post. Sancho scored twice and forced an own goal in his third competitive start for his country.\n\nSouthgate added: \u201cOur attacking play from Raheem, Jadon and Harry was outstanding. Raheem\u2019s two performances have been of the highest level. I think he\u2019s been almost unstoppable, his awareness of where defenders were, his ability to ride challenges, his vision and desire to get in on goal, and unselfish play as well, so I couldn\u2019t speak highly enough of the way he played. Jadon \u2013 you know we were talking about the three on Saturday \u2013 Jadon\u2019s performance was at that level as well. He worked really hard for the team without the ball and showed the ability he has to go past people, to be calm in tight areas. So, that part of our game was absolutely outstanding. We continued that threat for most of the game.\u201d\n\nThe Kosovo manager, Bernard Challandes, said Sterling was one of the best players in the world on current form. \u201cIt is impossible to play against him,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Sterling in the past was very speedy but the last choice or shot was not good. Now he is incredible. He has learned a lot from Guardiola and is one of the best players in the world now.\u201d\n\nSouthgate denied England\u2019s error-strewn display stemmed from his philosophy of playing out from the back and insisted it was an individual concern. He said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t got caught being pressured in our own six-yard box. The errors in Guim\u00e3raes were basics and the errors tonight were basics, so that\u2019s nothing to do with any philosophy. We didn\u2019t play out any more than Kosovo did. I don\u2019t think our mistakes came from playing ridiculous errors or taking unnecessary risks.\n\n\u201cI know we were saying international football was dull but that wasn\u2019t the case tonight. Did it go exactly as I hoped it would have gone? No, but I\u2019ve got to balance the two performances, the nine goals and what we\u2019ve achieved this week against the obvious errors that will cost you, have cost us tonight, and of course would cost us against better opposition.\u201d", "description": "The England manager, Gareth Southgate, called Raheem Sterling \u2018almost unstoppable\u2019 but also highlighted \u2018poor\u2019 mistakes in the 5-3 victory over Kosovo", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9877b42707847719be34cb62d0b4a68ffe8f3eb/0_61_5077_3048/master/5077.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be859eb05c4caf69a97a19914d0ebf5c", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
