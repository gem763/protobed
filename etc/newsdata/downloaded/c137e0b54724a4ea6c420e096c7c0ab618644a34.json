Some tossed food and drinks at protestors, which one person could be heard shouting, \"I need to get to work, I have to feed my kids.\"\n\nAnother video showed at least one man reaching up and grabbing the leg of a protester on top of a Tube train, dragging him onto the platform where he was quickly surrounded as he lay on the ground.\n\nOfficials told Sky News that four people were arrested at one station after gluing themselves to the doors.\n\nOne of the protesters told Reuters he glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway train \"for my grandchildren.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to ring an alarm bell, to wake people up and say please open your eyes,\" Phil Kingston, 83, told the news agency.\n\nCLIMATE PROTESTS IN EUROPE RESULT IN MORE THAN 250 ARRESTS, CRITICISM FROM GERMAN OFFICIAL\n\nPolice said they have arrested a total of 8 people and urged protesters not to target London's underground rail network.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the protesters, saying it was an \"unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers.\"\n\n\"This illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been arrested since the group began blocking roads, bridges and airports in London over a week ago to demand faster action on climate change. Most have been released without being charged.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The morning commute is apparently too sacred to be messed with.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
