(Scott Allen/The Washington Post)\n\nAs the students in her second-grade class at Arlington Traditional School finished their lunches Tuesday, Vicky Flynt instructed everyone to tidy their desks. They were about to welcome a special mystery guest, someone far more interesting than any of the media members who arrived a few minutes earlier under the guise of doing a story about the excitement of back-to-school season, so as not to spoil the surprise.\n\n\u201cIs it the mayor?\u201d a little girl asked between bites of a cheese stick.\n\nFlynt evidently hasn\u2019t reached the local government portion of this year\u2019s curriculum, but any of her students who were hoping to meet an elected county official were about to be sorely disappointed when D.C. sports royalty showed up instead. Alex Ovechkin walked into the classroom in his red Capitals sweater and shorts bearing gifts \u2014 a shopping cart full of boxes of Ovi O\u2019s, his new cereal.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s breakfast time for you guys, no?\u201d Ovechkin said.\n\nThe ensuing silence suggested that it was not, or perhaps that everyone was still full from lunch, or had no idea who this strange man with cuts all over his face was, or maybe all of the above. The visit would only get better from there.\n\n[The pizza guy's at the door. And he looks a lot like Alexander Ovechkin.]\n\nThe classroom was Ovechkin\u2019s first stop on an Ovi O\u2019s promotional tour that featured a visit with kids at Georgetown Hospital and ended at a Giant supermarket in D.C., where the Capitals captain worked the checkout line for several giddy customers, including his wife.\n\nOvi O\u2019s will be available exclusively at Giant stores in D.C., Maryland, Virginia and Delaware beginning on Sept. 17, Ovechkin\u2019s 34th birthday. The Stanley Cup champion taste-tested his honey-nut cereal during the development process, but on Tuesday, he sought the approval of the final product by Flynt\u2019s students.\n\nAlex Ovechkin was a secret special guest today in my classroom! He ate lunch with us (cereal \ud83d\ude0a). Thank you OVI! What an AMAZING unforgettable day! @MrsFlyntATS @APS_ATS @Capitals #OviOs pic.twitter.com/WejKma6cyE \u2014 Vicky (@MrsFlyntATS) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cTry it, open it, tell me if it\u2019s good,\u201d said Ovechkin, who sat down at a desk and, over a bowl of cereal, answered a variety of questions that were tougher than most of the inquiries he\u2019s used to facing in the locker room.\n\nCan you have orange hair?\n\n\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cI have gray hair.\u201d\n\nWhat did you eat out of the Stanley Cup?\n\n\u201cWe used it for everything,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWe were drinking from it. It was juice!\u201d\n\nDid you win the Cup more than once?\n\n\u201cNo, only once,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nDuring the visit, Ovechkin traded his spoon for a pencil and breezed through a two-sided addition work sheet, earning an A-plus. Judging by his struggles making change as a cashier at Giant a couple hours later, Ovechkin\u2019s subtraction skills could use some work.\n\nOvechkin was an unusually intimidating presence, with a nasty cut on the bridge of his nose, a scrape above his left eye and scratches on both hands, the result of a bike accident over the weekend. He looked like he could\u2019ve been wearing Halloween makeup, or as one customer at Giant remarked, \u201clike he\u2019d been in a train wreck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some differences,\u201d a little girl told Ovechkin, comparing the image of his smiling face on the front of his cereal box to the man staring back at her.\n\nOvechkin would later tell reporters that the accident happened during a training session on a hill near his house.\n\n\u201cThe bike broke, my pedals broke \u2014 stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to figure out what to do. Thank God I had a helmet on me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlex Ovechkin with kids at Georgetown Hospital. (Scott Allen/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter his brief return to school, Ovechkin headed to Georgetown Hospital to meet with patients in the pediatric hematology and oncology clinic. A portion of the proceeds from Ovi O\u2019s will benefit the Maryland-based Children\u2019s Cancer Foundation, Inc. a nonprofit committed to funding local researchers, programs and facilities.\n\n\u201cMilk is the key ingredient to good cereal,\u201d a boy in a \u201cWe Got Stanley\u201d T-shirt proclaimed as Ovechkin prepared to eat his second helping of the day.\n\nOvechkin posed for selfies, signed autographs and showed off his cereal\u2019s augmented reality feature. Scanning the front of the Ovi O\u2019s box in Snapchat reveals an interactive hockey game, wherein the user controls a digital Ovechkin as he shoots pieces of his cereal at moving targets.\n\nThe @Capitals & @BaltiVirtual are at the forefront of creating entertaining augmented reality activations.\n\n\n\nScan a box of Ovi O's cereal w/ @Snapchat & #AR Alex Ovechkin appears for you to take target practice with.@ovi8 #ALLCAPS\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f- @frntofficesportpic.twitter.com/6mwksYx7fr \u2014 AR & VR in Sport (@ARVRinSport) September 4, 2019\n\nFrom Georgetown, it was off to the Giant in Cathedral Heights, where Ovechkin, who did not participate in Tuesday morning\u2019s informal skate, was put to work. So much for a maintenance day. After changing into his personalized Giant employee uniform \u2014 black pants, a black shirt and an \u201cOVI\u201d name tag \u2014 Ovechkin rolled a cart of Ovi O\u2019s to the cereal aisle \u2014 No. 8, coincidentally \u2014 and stocked the shelves as onlookers in Capitals gear snapped photos.\n\n\n\n(Scott Allen/The Washington Post)\n\nOvechkin then moved to the checkout register, and, with the help of a patient Giant employee named Bruce, began ringing up customers. The line moved slower than it normally would, as Ovechkin signed boxes of cereal and posed for more photos. Ovechkin seemed to be getting the hang of things when his wife, Nastya, arrived at the front of the line with a cart full of produce, including apples and avocados, with no barcodes to scan. Ovechkin was flustered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mad at her,\u201d Ovechkin joked afterward. \u201cWe tried to do one thing and she gave me lots of different stuff.\u201d\n\nMary Ford, a die-hard fan from Annapolis who has met several Capitals at similar player appearances at Giant over the years, purchased two boxes of Ovi O\u2019s and had Ovechkin sign them both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to limit myself,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore the end of his first shift of the season, Ovechkin got on Giant\u2019s intercom system to share one final message: \u201cAttention Giant shoppers,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your Ovi O\u2019s. . See you guys on the ice. Bye.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were happy, they were smiling,\u201d Ovechkin said of the people he encountered on Tuesday\u2019s tour. \u201cEverybody had fun, so that\u2019s why we do it.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nCapitals training camp preview: When will Michal Kempny be fully healthy?\n\nCapitals training camp preview: What will bottom-six forward configuration be?\n\nCapitals training preview: Is Pheonix Copley\u2019s job as the backup goaltender safe?\n\nBrooks Orpik is back with the Capitals. in a player development role", "description": "The Capitals captain surprised kids and shoppers during a tour to promote his new Ovi O's cereal.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
