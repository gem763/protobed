It takes very little skill and only 25 minutes to make, but success lies in proper blending: Use a high-powered blender for the creamiest soup, or let it go a few minutes longer in a standard blender. Fennel and celery provide welcome depth, and the quick cashew cream feels luxurious spooned over the top or stirred right in. Save any extra to drizzle on other blended soups or even roasted vegetables. Finish this vibrant bowl with celery leaves, parsley or dill, and two basic but crucial ingredients: an extra drizzle of olive oil and a dusting of freshly ground pepper.", "description": "This nourishing, three-vegetable soup is thick and creamy, even without dairy It takes very little skill and only 25 minutes to make, but success lies in proper blending: Use a high-powered blender for the creamiest soup, or let it go a few minutes longer in a standard blender Fennel and celery provide welcome depth, and the quick cashew cream feels luxurious spooned over the top or stirred right in", "authors": ["Sarah Copeland", "Kay Chun", "Melissa Clark", "Dawn Lerman", "Elaine Sciolino", "Tara Parker-Pope", "Alison Roman", "Lidey Heuck", "Samin Nosrat", "Mark Bittman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/dining/sc-broccoli-soup-with-cashew-cream/sc-broccoli-soup-with-cashew-cream-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-01"}
