The stretch includes after a three-hit performance in a win against the Cardinals on Tuesday and two more hits on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHowie, again. It is great to see,\u201d Nationals bench coach Chip Hale said. \u201cHe is having a fantastic year. He\u2019s a pro; he just knows how to do things.\u201d\n\nKendrick is batting .343 with 16 home runs and 61 RBI in just 312 at-bats this season. He has played in 44 games at first base, 22 at second base and 15 at third for Nationals manager Dave Martinez, who did not make the trip to St. Louis due to health concerns. Hale is filling in as manager.\n\nBut Kendrick, no matter who the manager is, appreciates his role.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to complain one bit about the way I\u2019ve been used,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cWhen I play, I play. When I don\u2019t, I\u2019m ready to play and go in the game. And I\u2019ve kind of streamlined that process a little more throughout the year. I\u2019ve figured out, being in the National League, how to prepare myself and be ready.\u201d\n\nKendrick was a designated hitter at times during his stay in the American League with the Los Angeles Angels from 2006 to 2014. He smashed a career-high 18 homers in 2011.\n\nKendrick jumped to the National League in 2015 with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has been in the National League ever since. As a National League bench player, Kendrick knows he has to be ready to pinch hit and be part of double switches.\n\nKendrick was traded to the Nationals from the Philadelphia Phillies during the 2017 season and hit .293 with Washington to help win an NL East title.\n\nKendrick ruptured his Achilles last season while playing left field at Nationals Park in May and hit .303 in just 40 games.\n\n\u201cIf that was the last year of my deal, I don\u2019t know if I would have been in the major leagues this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause a lot of times, the way the league is now, bringing veteran guys back and being around the game, you don\u2019t see too many veteran guys around anymore. Having the ability to come back to a place where I really enjoy and get to be around these guys and have fun \u2026 it\u2019s been cool to be able to see these guys grow.\u201d\n\nKendrick has made an impression on young players like Nationals center fielder Victor Robles and left fielder Juan Soto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very impressive, the way he\u2019s able to go out there and not be an everyday player, not necessarily because of his ability but because, physically, it\u2019s hard and demanding, so he\u2019s unable to play every day,\u201d Robles said through team interpreter Octavio Martinez. \u201cBut the fact that he\u2019s a bench player and comes off the bench and is able to keep his timing, his at-bats are just so impressive. He\u2019s just a tremendous ballplayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been terrific for us,\u201d general manager Mike Rizzo said on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday. \u201cHe is such a professional hitter and a professional gentleman.\u201d\n\nKendrick said he has been able to stay young at heart being around players like Robles, Soto, third baseman Anthony Rendon and shortstop Trea Turner.\n\nKendrick works hard at his craft and gives a lot of credit to Nationals hitting coach Kevin Long.\n\n\u201cI have been putting in a lot of work with Kevin this year,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cWe have a lot of good, young guys. These guys keep you going every day.\u201d\n\nWashington begins a three-game series Friday at the Miami Marlins.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a strong finish,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cWe have to compete the rest of the way. We have to stay on our \u2018A\u2019 game. Hopefully, it will work out.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
