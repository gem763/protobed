She was a strategic thinker.\u201d\n\nPelosi and Georgia Congressman John Lewis were among about a dozen House members who attended services at Brookland Baptist Church for Emily Clyburn, who died last week at age 80 after a decades-long battle with diabetes.\n\nTwo Democratic presidential contenders, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, also were present Sunday. Former Vice President Joe Biden planned to attend another service Monday in Charleston, and Pelosi said other members of Congress also would be on hand.\n\nMarried for nearly six decades, the Clyburns met as students at South Carolina State University. Rep. Clyburn has often told the story of how he met his future wife in jail after they were both arrested while protesting against segregation at an Orangeburg drug store counter, a tale recounted Sunday by Emily Clyburn\u2019s college roommate.\n\nHungry, the congressman has said Emily Clyburn walked up to him with a hamburger. As he reached for it, she tore it, keeping half for herself.\n\n\u201cI tell everybody she got me for half a hamburger,\u201d Jim Clyburn said.\n\nThey married just over a year later.\n\nEmily Clyburn, a native of Moncks Corner, was known affectionately to many as \u201cMs. Emily.\u201d She went on to become a public school librarian in Columbia and Charleston before spending nearly 30 years as a medical librarian at the Charleston Naval Base and Dorn VA Medical Center in Columbia.\n\nThrough the years, the couple raised millions of dollars for the endowment and need-based scholarships at their alma mater, from which Emily Clyburn received an honorary doctorate in 2010. A pedestrian bridge in Orangeburg linking S.C. State to student housing over a five-lane road bears her name.\n\n\u201cMs. Emily will never be duplicated,\u201d Columbia City Councilman Sam Davis said. \u201cBut she will be a model for humanitarians to come.\u201d\n\nRep. Clyburn, 79, has often remarked on his wife\u2019s steady influence on his political decision-making through the years, including the notion he once entertained of leaving Congress after Republicans took back the U.S. House following the 2010 elections due to a frustration at failing to get things accomplished.\n\nEmily Clyburn talked him out of it \u2013 in part by joking she didn\u2019t need him around the house all the time playing golf, but also telling him he had way too much left to accomplish.\n\n\u201cAs always, she was right,\u201d Clyburn said in 2015.\n\nOne by one, friends and colleagues offered their support to the Clyburn family, with many calling on Rep. Clyburn to turn to his faith in his time of loss.\n\n\u201cWe pray for Congressman Clyburn,\u201d said Rosalyn Glenn, a financial planner and former Democratic nominee for state treasurer, during an opening prayer. \u201cJust like you gave her to him then, because you knew what he needed then, we\u2019re going to thank you that you give him what he needs now.\u201d\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Leading congressional Democrats and some of the party's presidential contenders gathered Sunday for the funeral of Emily Clyburn, wife of House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and prolific fundraiser in support of helping students attend the alma mater they shared.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Meg Kinnard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/Obit_Clyburn_Wife_21711.jpg-6d78a_c0-110-2661-1661_s1770x1032.jpg?fb3736007db5f0f2caef5355eec2eccab0564232", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
