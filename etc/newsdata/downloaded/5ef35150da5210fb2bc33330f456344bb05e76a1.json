Yovanovitch, who was withdrawn earlier this year, told investigators last week that the president ousted her on \u201cunfounded and false claims.\u201d\n\nPrevious witnesses have described how policy staff were sidelined on Ukraine by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others. Investigators expect to hear next week from acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who raised concerns that security aid was being withheld to pressure Ukraine, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve uncovered significant evidence of Trump\u2019s abuse of power. And we\u2019ll continue to expose the truth,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\nTrump denounced the inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d on Twitter early on Wednesday and later told reporters that Democrats were being disrespectful. He accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of handing out subpoenas \u201clike cookies.\u201d\n\nIn related news, the FBI on Wednesday arrested David Correia, one of four people charged last week in an alleged scheme to funnel $1 million in donations to politicians and political candidates to benefit a planned marijuana business funded by an unnamed Russian businessman.\n\nRAMPING UP ATTACKS\n\nRamping up attacks on Democrats, House Republicans complained of being denied access to witness transcripts and said they would introduce a censure resolution against Schiff.\n\nA House vote to impeach Trump would lead to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate that could result in his ouster. But so far, few Senate Republicans have criticized the president.\n\nThe House probe is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nDemocrats accuse Trump of pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on a domestic rival after withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid to help combat Russian-backed separatists. Zelenskiy agreed to investigate. Trump eventually allowed the aid.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and defended his request to Zelenskiy. Biden and his son also deny wrongdoing.\n\nGordon Sondland, a Trump political donor and a key actor in the unfolding political drama as U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is expected to appear on Thursday in response to a subpoena after he initially declined to testify.", "description": "A former adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who abruptly resigned last week spoke on Wednesday to an impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump pursued political interests in his dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441619942&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1B4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
