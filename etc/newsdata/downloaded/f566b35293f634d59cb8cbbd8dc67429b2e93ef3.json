Penn State drove 35 yards on a gassed Iowa defense, and the last of three straight runs by Cain made it 17-6.\n\nIowa pulled within 17-12 when Stanley found Brandon Smith for a 33-yard TD pass with 2:31 to go. The Hawkeyes' two-point try failed though, and Cain converted a crucial third down that ensured that Iowa never saw the ball again.\n\nUp 7-6 late in the third quarter, Penn State recovered a fumble at Iowa's 16 and Sean Clifford connected on an apparent touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth that was overturned on review. Iowa then held the Nittany Lions at the 1-foot line, and two straight holding calls forced them to settle for a 33-yard field goal.\n\nKJ Hamler caught seven passes, including a 22-yarder for a TD, for Penn State.\n\nPenn State defensive tackle Robert Windsor, center, sacks Iowa quarterback Nate Stanley during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Iowa City, Iowa.

Penn State was on the road against a talented team with a jacked-up crowd, and yet the Nittany Lions were the ones making the plays that made the difference.\n\nIowa: The Hawkeyes nearly went back-to-back games without a touchdown. Granted, Michigan and Penn State are really good on defense. But Iowa can't continue to lean on its own defense to keep it in games. At 1-2 in the league and with Wisconsin looking like one of the best teams in America, the Big Ten West doesn't look so winnable anymore.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nPenn State might move up a few spots. Iowa might struggle to hang onto its spot in the Top 25 after back-to-back losses.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPenn State hosts Michigan on Oct. 19.\n\nIowa hosts Purdue next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nPenn State defensive tackle Robert Windsor, center, celebrates a sack with safety Garrett Taylor, left, and defensive tackle Antonio Shelton, right, during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Iowa, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Iowa City, Iowa.
