REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo\n\nThe trader posted about the fall - which he told Reuters was more than 10% at the time - on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter. His post went viral, attracting thousands of comments and becoming one of the most searched items on Weibo last week.\n\nThe trader, who declined to give his name, said such price swings were not unusual in the speculative world of cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s clear sneaker speculators were pulling money out of the market\u201d after the Chinese government and netizens responded angrily to the comment by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, he said.\n\nMorey quickly deleted his tweet, but the damage was done.\n\nChinese state media started to attack him, the Houston Rockets and the National Basketball Association (NBA), accusing them of endorsing violence and peddling a \u201csecessionist pipe dream.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, quotes for tokens backed by the Air Jordan 1 Retro High Satin Black Toe shoes - the latest variant of the iconic 1980s model - have fallen 34%, according to Reuters calculations based on data from 55.com, a major global exchange for asset-backed tokens.\n\nIn China, the trading of tokens and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is banned, but Chinese investors are active on overseas exchanges. On 55.com, traders can exchange yuan for cryptocurrencies such as Tether via Alipay or WeChat to acquire tokens.\n\nIt is also possible on 55.com to trade tokens backed by other designer merchandise such as hoodies by Supreme, a U.S. clothing brand under the Carlyle Group.\n\nHong Kong-based George Gao, a sneaker brand influencer in China with more than 38,000 followers on his YouTube channel, said the NBA backlash among mainland basketball fans was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\nGlobal brands can suffer when they offend their client base in China, where millions of online citizens rapidly respond to perceived cultural slights or insults to the country. For NBA, the China market is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion.\n\nLast week, Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several Nike stores in major Chinese cities.\n\nPoizon and DoNew, two Chinese mobile shopping apps popular among fans of designer sneakers, also took NBA-logo shoes off their platforms, traders said.\n\nXu Xiaotian, an avid sneaker collector in the southern city of Guangzhou, said he would boycott \u201canti-China\u201d brands and take political concerns into consideration during his next purchase.\n\nBut he also said individual NBA players were not directly involved in the controversy.\n\nIn June, Xu bought online a pair of Nike Air Jordan 1 Retro High \u201cPass The Torch\u201d sneakers inspired by the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard. Xu paid 13,000 yuan ($1,837.85) and sold them for 33,000 yuan that month.\n\nXu said he would invest in NBA shoes again despite his feelings about the NBA.\n\nLeBron James - a star player for the Los Angeles Lakers and widely considered to be the face of the NBA - weighed in on the controversy on Monday, saying Morey \u201cwasn\u2019t educated\u201d when he sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nOn mobile app Sneaker Sale Calendar, a popular tool for sneaker price comparison among Chinese collectors, the price of Nike\u2019s LeBron 16 \u201cMPLS\u201d shoes rose 142% to 1,944 yuan on Wednesday from a day earlier.\n\nOther brands associated with the NBA, such as Nike and Adidas, have been largely unscathed.\n\nGao said the price of a new pair of limited-edition Nike shoes in collaboration with U.S. rapper Travis Scott, which made their debut in China on Friday, surged more than fivefold to almost 8,000 yuan from 1,399 yuan in online resale markets.\n\n\u201cPolitical factors do affect my choice,\u201d said Chen Luwei, a Chinese sneaker fan studying in Australia.\n\n\u201cIf there is any insulting speech by Nike or Adidas, it may affect my decision to buy their shoes,\u201d Chen said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just throw away my previous ones, right?\u201d", "description": "On Oct. 4, a Chinese trader noticed a sharp drop in the price of crypto tokens backed by Nike's Air Jordan sneakers on a U.S.-based exchange after the general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets tweeted support for the protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Yawen Chen", "Ryan Woo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441393753&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0I7-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
