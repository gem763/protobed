As the impeachment inquiry threatens to harden party divisions even further, now may be a good time to remember those congressional alumni whose bipartisanship and courage made us better as a nation.\n\nOn June 1, 1950, as McCarthyism began to divide Congress and America, Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, a Republican from Maine, issued her \u201cDeclaration of Conscience,\u201d asking for bipartisan cooperation to protect national security. \u201cIt is high time that we stopped thinking politically as Republicans and Democrats about elections,\u201d she said, \u201cand started thinking patriotically as Americans about national security based on individual freedom.\u201d\n\nThe joint efforts of Sen. Richard G. Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, helped bring about the deactivation of thousands of nuclear and chemical weapons left over from the Cold War. After he left Congress, Lugar established the Lugar Center, a think tank dedicated to good governance and bipartisanship. Nunn still serves as co-chair of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonpartisan organization he co-founded in 2001 that fights the use and spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nRep. Barbara Jordan, a Texas Democrat and civil rights leader, supported a wide range of Democratic causes but wasn\u2019t afraid to break ranks with traditional party thinking. As the chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform from 1994 until her death in 1996, Jordan favored more controls on immigration, including increased enforcement against illegal immigrants and their employers.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford, who died in 2006, was a moderate Republican who was known for bipartisan leadership throughout his 25 years in the House. Ford stoked controversy when he pardoned Richard Nixon but did what he thought was best for the nation to bring about internal peace; his own political career suffered as a result. Ford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award.\n\nSen. Philip Hart, a Michigan Democrat known\u2014by both parties\u2014as the \u201cConscience of the Senate,\u201d was a World War II combat veteran who championed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act. Hart was respected for standing up for what he believed was right, rather than what was politically expedient.\n\nA pragmatic and independent senator who often broke ranks with her party was Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine. She served as co-chair of the Senate Centrist Coalition, a bipartisan group. \u201cWe can have our differences here, but we ought to be able to talk with each other without being punished for it,\u201d Snowe said in 2001.\n\nAlso not a fan of political polarization was the late Sen. Mike Mansfield, a Montana Democrat. He believed moderation was often the best way to win in any arena. In a New York Times interview at the age of 95, he said, \u201cDifferences can be bridged, solutions can be found, concessions can be made. It's much better to take an inch than to take nothing at all.\u201d\n\nNew York Rep. Shirley Chisholm, who died in 2005, was known to criticize Democratic and Republican congressional leaders alike. Chisholm also defended to fellow African-Americans the need to work with white politicians to get things done. \u201cWe still have to engage in compromise,\u201d Chisholm said, \u201cthe highest of all arts.\u201d\n\nFinally, Republican Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainGraham-Trump rollercoaster hits dizzying speed McSally says Senate taking 'serious look' at Trump call unlike 'partisan' House Mark Kelly outraises McSally in Arizona Senate race for third straight quarter MORE, who died last year, criticized his party and president on several issues, spoke out for civility, and also maintained close friendships with Democrats such as Ted Kennedy. Today McCain\u2019s family carries on his spirit of bipartisanship through a social media and action campaign called #ActsOfCivility. McCain\u2019s widow, Cindy McCain, urges on the website, johnmccain.com: \u201cCommit to something larger than yourself. Reach across the aisle. Break the barrier. Come together for civil engagement.\u201d Wise words indeed. And sorely needed ones.\n\nRitch K. Eich, former chief of public affairs for Blue Shield of California, has published four books on leadership. A retired captain in the naval reserve, he served on Congressional committees for Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Dan Coats of Indiana.
