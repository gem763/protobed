Col. Alexander Vindman testified to House impeachment committees that corrections he sought to make to the record of Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky share tweet email save Embed\n\nFive times yesterday, Donald Trump published tweets insisting that everyone \u201c read the transcript \u201d of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The advice seemed unwise: those who\u2019ve read the call summary realize it includes incriminating details that make Trump look worse, which is why many Republicans said it was a \u201c huge mistake \u201d for the White House to release it.\n\nBut there\u2019s a related problem of even greater importance: the summary of the controversial call isn\u2019t a transcript at all.\n\nAt first glance, the problem with the ellipses in the call summary may not seem altogether new. Those who read the document carefully, for example, know that it showed Trump telling Zelensky, \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been clear what those ellipses between \u201clook into it\u201d and \u201cit sounds horrible\u201d represented. Were words omitted? Did Trump trail off, losing his train of thought? Was there a brief interruption to the call? What about the other two instances in which ellipses appeared in the call summary?\n\nThose ellipses have suddenly taken on an even greater significance, following yesterday\u2019s testimony in the congressional inquiry.\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told members of Congress that he tried to edit a White House log of a July call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president to include details that were omitted, one lawmaker present at the testimony and another source familiar with it confirmed to NBC News. Vindman testified in a closed-door deposition before House impeachment investigators that the attempted edits were to reflect Trump mentioning possible recordings of former vice president Joe Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy mentioning Bursima, the company who had hired Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, the sources said.\n\nA New York Times report added that there is no audio recording of the Trump/Zelensky call, but White House notetakers and voice recognition software created a rough transcript. At that point, the document went to Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the White House National Security Council, to help fill in gaps, especially as they relate to proper nouns and technical terms that would be unfamiliar to notetakers and the software.\n\nVindman reviewed the rough transcript and made edits. Yesterday, the Army lieutenant colonel told lawmakers that some of those edits were not reflected in the final document that was released to the public.\n\nAnd according to the latest reporting, some of the omissions related specifically to Trump\u2019s interest in Joe Biden.\n\nFor context, it\u2019s worth noting that Donald Trump has assured the public that the released call summary is \u201can exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation.\u201d In fact, the American president has referred to the document as an \u201cexact\u201d transcript at least 16 times.\n\nIt now appears those claims were false \u2013 and it\u2019s a curious thing for Trump to have lied about.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some of the White House\u2019s more sycophantic allies, including lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have repeatedly suggested that the call summary is the only relevant piece of evidence, and it\u2019s not incriminating enough to warrant presidential impeachment. It\u2019s a dubious argument for a variety of reasons \u2013 not the least of which is that the call summary is just part of a larger picture \u2013 but it\u2019s suddenly even less convincing now that we know that the transcript isn\u2019t a transcript, and its omissions are directly relevant to the scandal.\n\nAs for the apparent attempt at a White House cover-up, it\u2019ll be interesting to know who was involved in keeping Vindman\u2019s recommended edits out of the official document.", "description": "Trump said he released \"an exact word-for-word transcript\" of his conversation with the Ukrainian president.
