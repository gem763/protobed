Costa Group is scheduled to come out of an extended trading halt on Wednesday. It last traded at $3.46.\n\nShares not taken up by institutions under their entitlements were due to be sold overnight in a shortfall bookbuild, scheduled to close at 8am on Wednesday.\n\nMr Costa said he was annoyed at the destruction in value of his own holding, but people needed to understand it was a cyclical industry which would eventually improve. \"It's annoyed me, but it doesn't worry me.''\n\nThe value of the mushroom market in Australia had grown by almost 5 per cent in 2018, but has fallen around 2.5 per cent this year.\n\nCosta Group chief executive Harry Debney said on Tuesday the company would only restore its credibility with investors by showing it could deliver consistent growth. \"It's got to be demonstrated performance.''\n\nHe blamed a poorly timed marketing campaign promoting mushrooms early in 2019 for some of the issues in the segment.\n\nThe downturn in the mushroom sector hadn't been factored in. \"It caught everyone by surprise.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Debney also described a dispute with Vitalharvest Freehold Trust, the ASX-listed landowner of large berry and citrus operations which Costa Group leases in NSW, Tasmania and South Australia, as ''noise'' which would be resolved.\n\nHe said Costa Group was furnishing information to Vitalharvest as required under the law.\n\nVitalharvest told the ASX on Tuesday that for the nine months to September the variable rent component for citrus crops leased to Costa was down 33 per cent compared with the previous three-year average.\n\nTotal variable rent was down 52 per cent on the prior three-year average.\n\nVitalharvest managing director Liam Lenaghan said it was ''disappointing the previously communicated favourable citrus harvest outlook hasn't materialised and the berry category has deteriorated''.\n\nCosta leases 399 hectares of berry-producing land in NSW and Tasmania and 1942 hectares of citrus land in South Australia's Riverland district from Vitalharvest.\n\nOther members of the Costa family also hold shares in Costa Group.\n\nCiti analyst Craig Woolford cut his 12-month target price for Costa Group to $2.90, from $4.20 previously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe labelled the balance sheet repair via the capital raising as ''costly'' and said while the company was suggesting prices of avocadoes, blueberries and mushrooms would improve in 2020, he believed the recovery would only be modest.\n\n\"Blueberry prices remain weak with industry production very high,'' he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Costa family remain shareholders in the Costa Group, which they floated in 2015, after it was founded by Frank and Adrian Costa in 1959.\n\nFrank Costa announced his retirement from the Costa board in July.", "description": "The co-founder of Costa Group has baulked at injecting more funds into the company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dd2d4ac4fda4156727d0bfd2b40ab08efd618e68", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
