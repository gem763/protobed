But over the course of the past week the jiu-jitsu ace, Bellator athlete and Conor McGregor training partner has totally ruined his online persona by exposing his true colors \u2013 as a generous man with a heart of gold.\n\nDanis took time out from training and tweeting to take a stand when he saw something that appalled him and every other fair-minded person who saw it.\n\nIt was a video of a Baltimore schoolboy who, after being cornered in a school bathroom, was made to remove his glasses before being set upon by a gang of bullies, who battered the youngster with punches, kicks and slaps while someone recorded the incident on a mobile phone.\n\nthese videos break my heart nobody should have to go though this, if anyone knows how to contact him i wanna get him into martial arts immediately #fuckbullies pic.twitter.com/Mz5vEHj8Qo \u2014 Dillon Danis (@dillondanis) October 11, 2019\n\nA disgusted Danis shared the video with a profane, but (in this writer\u2019s opinion) appropriate hashtag, saying: \u201cThese videos break my heart. Nobody should have to go through this. If anyone knows how to contact him I wanna get him into martial arts immediately.\u201d\n\nThat started off a series of events that eventually connected Danis with the young man in question, whom he then hooked up with his first jiu-jitsu lesson. He even arranged for an Uber to pick him up and take him to the gym.\n\nsmall gestures go a long way \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/rgfyXYXOlk \u2014 Dillon Danis (@dillondanis) October 12, 2019\n\nWednesday, Danis proudly shared a pic of the young man in question, wearing a gi, complete with his white belt.\n\nI am so proud of this young man for taking me up on my offer and getting into the dojo. Showing up is half the battle and that applies to everything in this life. We\u2019re all in this together, let\u2019s go champ! pic.twitter.com/mRTpMFlW1n \u2014 Dillon Danis (@dillondanis) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI am so proud of this young man for taking me up on my offer and getting into the dojo,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cShowing up is half the battle and that applies to everything in this life. We\u2019re all in this together, let\u2019s go champ!\u201d\n\nWhile it would be easy to launch into some sort of lengthy prose extolling the benefits of martial arts, and praising Danis as a true martial artist for making this gesture, we\u2019ll spare you the time.\n\nInstead we\u2019ll just applaud both Danis for doing what he\u2019s doing, and his new young proteg\u00e9 for taking his first step. He may only be a Day 1 white belt, but he\u2019s a martial artist now. We wish you well, @keydayoungan__.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
