REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s rand was little changed early on Wednesday as traders took profits on the dollar and braced for more volatility, with hopes fading for a trade truce between the United States and China.\n\nAt 0645 GMT the rand was up 0.1% at 15.2575 per dollar, a small move off its overnight low of 15.3050.\n\nOn Tuesday, the rand shed nearly 1% as risk sentiment was battered by the standoff between the United States and Turkey over Syria and then by Washington\u2019s imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials.\n\nThe rand is one of the most liquid and frequently traded emerging-market currencies, and a high degree of foreign investment makes it sensitive to offshore events and swings in risk sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe rand\u2019s underperformance yesterday could continue through the week, with key topside resistance levels in the 15.40-15.50 region likely to be eyed as investors will be hard-pressed to look favourably on a rand,\u201d ETM Analytics said in a note to clients.\n\nThe local session will see the release of September business confidence index, followed by the release after the close of the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes of its last meeting.\n\nThe South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s monthly business confidence index fell to a three-decade low last month, underlining the fragile state of Africa\u2019s most advanced economy.\n\nBonds were slightly higher, with the yield on the benchmark 2026 paper down 1.5 basis points to 8.265%.", "description": "South Africa's rand was little changed early on Wednesday as traders took profits on the dollar and braced for more volatility, with hopes fading for a trade truce between the United States and China.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438740199&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980FD-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
