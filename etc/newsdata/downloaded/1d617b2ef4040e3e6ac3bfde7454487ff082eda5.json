(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington\u2019s four-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series gave the Nationals six full days off before the franchise begins play in its first World Series. . Some fans and analysts have asked whether Washington\u2019s sprint through the NLCS actually offers too much of a layoff, and recent history backs up their trepidation.\n\nSince MLB went through a realignment in 1994 and the playoffs expanded to three division winners plus a wild card in each league, the World Series team that entered with more rest has a 12-12 record in the championship series. In 2012, baseball added a second wild-card team to each league. Since then, the World Series team with more rest has posted a 1-6 record, the lone victory coming last season when the Boston Red Sox, after five days off, defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had a three-day break.\n\n[10 plays that pushed the Nationals to the World Series]\n\nBefore that, the team with fewer days of rest had won nine straight titles. Teams with six or more days of rest are 6-7 since 1994, and 0-4 in the double wild-card era.\n\nShould the Nats be concerned? To be fair, Washington\u2019s pitching rotation is more talented than those from the previous four teams that enjoyed at least six days of pre-World Series rest. Washington\u2019s starters struck out a higher percentage of batters than its well-rested predecessors (even after controlling for era, league and park effects); allowed a lower rate of hard-hit balls (again, adjusted for era); and were worth more wins above replacement collectively during the regular season. In addition, Washington\u2019s starters allowed 71 fewer runs than expected given the men on base and outs remaining in the inning at the time of the at-bat (known as RE24) \u2014 a significantly greater savings than any of the previous four well-rested pitching staffs.\n\nWorld Series team with six or more days rest Wins above replacement RE24 Strikeout rate Hard-hit rate 2012 Tigers 3.4 -137 14 percent (28 percent lower than the league average) 33 percent (13 percent higher than the league average) 2014 Royals 11.6 +30 17 percent (14 percent lower) 29 percent (1 percent lower) 2015 Mets 16.0 +33 22 percent (4 percent higher) 27 percent (7 percent lower) 2016 Indians 13.4 +24 23 percent (8 percent higher) 33 percent (4 percent higher) 2019 Nationals 21.4 +71 26 percent (12 percent higher) 33 percent (13 percent lower)\n\nFor a team loaded with veterans, Nationals outfielder Adam Eaton thinks the extra rest could be a blessing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay locked in. We\u2019re going to make sure we get our time off, get our guys in line,\u201d Eaton told 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday. \u201cWe got an older group. The older guys don\u2019t recover nearly as fast as some of the young bucks do, so we are going to take this time and use it to our advantage.\u201d\n\nThe first advantage of the time off? Setting the pitching rotation precisely how you want it. The American League representative could be scrambling to set its rotation for the World Series But Washington General Mike Rizzo, during his weekly radio segment with The Junkies on 106.7 The Fan, said he expects Max Scherzer to start in Tuesday\u2019s Game 1 of the World Series and Stephen Strasburg to be on the mound in Game 2.\n\nScherzer allowed nine earned runs in 24\u2154 innings (for a 3.28 ERA) when rested six or more days in 2019, striking out 30 of 95 batters faced (32 percent). Hitters, meanwhile, managed to bat just .193 with a .605 OPS against him in those outings. That will play.\n\nStrasburg, on the other hand, struggled in his well-rested outings. In fact, the 30-year-old ace got progressively worse as his rest increased, with his ERA jumping from 2.59 on four days rest to 3.79 on five days rest to 5.09 with six or more days rest. Some of that is a sample size issue \u2014 Strasburg pitched just 23 innings this season on long rest \u2014 but the Nationals know better than anyone it doesn\u2019t take much to derail a title run.\n\nPatrick Corbin\u2019s numbers provide no reason for concern. Like Scherzer, his performance improves with rest and his results are in stark contrast to Strasburg\u2019s. Corbin had two starts with at least six days rest and he went 2-0, allowing four earned runs over 20 innings (1.80 ERA) and striking out 21 of 78 batters faced (27 percent).\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez was more difficult for batters in his well-rested starts, but the splits for him aren\u2019t as eye-catching as Scherzer or Corbin\u2019s, although they do look solid in comparison to Strasburg\u2019s.\n\nPerhaps Washington fans should be worried more about the Nationals\u2019 hitting coming off this six-day breather than the impressive pitching staff. The four teams getting extra rest (six or more days) since 2012 batted a combined .223 with a .642 OPS in the first game of the World Series. And three of the four, the outlier being the 2016 Cleveland Indians, lost the championship opener.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat you need to know about 2019 World Series\n\nFourteen years after baseball\u2019s return to D.C., the original Nats love what they\u2019re seeing\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 World Series roster strategy figures to be big on stars, not on subs\n\nThe Nationals are going to the World Series \u2014 and a city\u2019s baseball scars have healed\n\nBoswell: Off to the World Series, these Nationals have proved everyone wrong\n\nHow the Nationals celebrated Washington\u2019s first World Series berth in 86 years\n\nThe last time Washington\u2019s baseball team advanced to the World Series\n\nWatch the Nationals\u2019 soggy, sudsy and surprisingly Strasburgy NLCS celebration", "description": "Recent history offers grist for Washington Nationals supporters worried about this six-day layoff.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post", "October At Am", "Neil Greenberg Is A Staff Writer With The Washington Post Whose Beat Is Sports Analytics.
