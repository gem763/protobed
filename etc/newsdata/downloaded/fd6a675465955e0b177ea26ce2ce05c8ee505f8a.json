The horse-riding populace of the late-19th century did not imagine the automobile revolution only shortly to come. And, more recent and pertinent, very few if any people predicted as late as 2006 that, beginning just a year later, they would gladly fork over $750 for a phone.\n\nIn a round of Axios emails to tech analysts, investors and professors, we heard the broad observation that we are at peak smartphone because of market saturation, and that the device as we precisely know and use it may in fact be soon old hat.\n\nto tech analysts, investors and professors, we heard the broad observation that we are at peak smartphone because of market saturation, and that the device as we precisely know and use it may in fact be soon old hat. But there was deep skepticism that we are anywhere near giving them up entirely for something else. \u201cWhile some will call for [the smartphone\u2019s] demise over time, we do not see that even with binoculars on looking ahead,\u201d said Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush.\n\nIn a May blogpost, Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreesen Horowitz, said that smart phones are at the peak of their cycle now. \u201cI\u2019m not updating my smartphone model anymore,\u201d he wrote. In an email exchange with Axios, Evans suggested that we are in a long, technological interregnum:\n\n\u201cSmartphones are getting towards the top of the S Curve (the way PCs have) \u2014 all the easy, obvious innovation is done, and diminishing returns have set in. Most of the remaining big improvements are (probably) around the camera (and that\u2019s mostly in software),\u201d Evans said.\n\nthe top of the S Curve (the way PCs have) \u2014 all the easy, obvious innovation is done, and diminishing returns have set in. Most of the remaining big improvements are (probably) around the camera (and that\u2019s mostly in software),\u201d Evans said. But, he adds, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a replacement yet.\u201d Wearables and AR are years away from being mass market, and neither look likely to be \u201cthe hub of everything you do online,\u201d like today\u2019s smartphone.\n\nBetween the lines: The idea of the hub \u2014 of one device that does everything \u2014 will be hard to improve on. Why would massive numbers of people exchange such a device for a half dozen or a more that do our stuff separately?\n\n\u201cEven when the world around us will be full of sensors and every device will be connected \u2013 which will take considerable time \u2014 I still wonder if a single device will have to be a constant,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies.\n\nwill be full of sensors and every device will be connected \u2013 which will take considerable time \u2014 I still wonder if a single device will have to be a constant,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. The name of the device may change, but its singular nature will remain the same. \u201cSo maybe it will be called a smart digital identity unit rather than a smartphone.\u201d\n\nWhat the smartphone of the future may become:\n\nSmartphones themselves will morph with better connectivity, compute, and display technologies than today\u2019s devices, says Prabal Dutta, a professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nwill morph with better connectivity, compute, and display technologies than today\u2019s devices, says Prabal Dutta, a professor at the University of Michigan. From there, they will become the dominant augmented reality interface in non-gaming and non-industrial applications.\n\nbecome the dominant augmented reality interface in non-gaming and non-industrial applications. And they will stand in until the public is more ready for wearables like Google Glass, and batteries are powerful enough to run them for a reasonable length of time.\n\nAdds James Cham, a partner with Bloomberg Beta: \u201cOne day we'll have audio interfaces implanted next to our ears and ways to send thoughts through direct brain interfaces.\"\n\nThe bottom line: \"For the next few years you are going to have to deal with awkward devices in your pocket and accidentally running into people as both of you stare downward (as my son just did on Tuesday while we were walking on the National Mall).\u201d", "description": "Peak smartphone may be upon us, ushering in a new era.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/27Vi4xxLS5ipovgiG2aE56cSCf8=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/14/1560542999108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-15"}
