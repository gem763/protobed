We reviewed the charts Monday, noting that, \"FDX is not showing us a really strong pattern ahead of earnings but it is a constructive pattern and a long position is favored risking a close below $159. A rally to the $200-$210 area is possible.\"\n\nLet's take a look at two more charts with a different indicator and arranging the price reversals differently on the Point and Figure chart.\n\nIn the updated daily bar chart of FDX, below, we can see that prices are struggling at the intersection of the declining 200-day moving average line. The 50-day line is still positive as is the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line.\n\nIn the lower panel we have added the 12-day price momentum study, which shows higher lows from May to August which is a bullish divergence when compared to the price action making lower lows.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of FDX, below, the price action is plotted by the average true range. A trade at $177.12 should be positive for this chart while a breakdown to $146.88 is likely to be bearish.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Many times charts do not reveal any new clues from one day to the next but FDX still shows a constructive pattern and a long position is favored risking a close below $159.", "description": "FedEx Is Still Looking Constructive Ahead of Earnings...FDX", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Fedex Is Still Looking Constructive Ahead Of Earnings", "A Look At Two More Charts With A Different Indicator.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Dave Butler", "Mark Sebastian", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a89264aa-bb3f-11e8-b0bf-7fa32668bf6b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
