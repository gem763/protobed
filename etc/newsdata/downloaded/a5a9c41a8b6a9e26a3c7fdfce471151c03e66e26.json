Bolton, will be able to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nHouse Democrats had subpoenaed the witness, Charles M. Kupperman, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, to testify on Monday. But in an effort to stop Mr. Kupperman from doing so, the White House said on Friday that the president had invoked \u201cconstitutional immunity,\u201d leaving Mr. Kupperman uncertain about what to do.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff obviously cannot satisfy the competing demands of both the legislative and executive branches, and he is aware of no controlling judicial authority definitively establishing which branch\u2019s command should prevail,\u201d the suit said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Kupperman-Subpoena-Impeachment-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
