It was dreadful,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Channel 4 Image caption The contestants had the chance to win a share of \u00a3100,000\n\nShe told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland the whole thing started as a joke by her granddaughter Lucy - who filled out an application for the show on her behalf, then \"deleted it\".\n\nIrene said: \"I was not aware until I got a call from [production company] Shine saying we really liked your application and I'm going '...really?'.\n\n\"Don't forget it's an island - I don't swim and I don't particularly like water, certainly not the sea. I need to get even with Lucy, I'll get her back.\"\n\n'It was wonderful'\n\nIrene is the oldest contestant ever to take part in the show - but said her age often worked to her advantage.\n\nShe said: \"I just felt that these other ones on the team saw me perhaps as a mother or grandmother and were quite prepared to take care of me.\n\n\"But I wanted to do the same as them - I was just on that island to fight for survival, hunt, and I wanted to do that as well but I think they were trying to protect me.\"\n\nDespite the challenge of surviving on the island, she said it was great holiday.\n\nShe added: \"It was wonderful, I loved all these creepy crawlies - each one was a pet - and I would recommend it as a holiday. It doesn't cost very much, you have the beach and the water, you have all the jungle to go through, lovely.\n\n\"I just hope it's an inspiration to some of these older ladies. Get out there and do it!\"", "description": "Irene Cattanach, 75, is the oldest contestant on the reality show set on a deserted Pacific island.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16877/production/_108797229_hi056464483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
