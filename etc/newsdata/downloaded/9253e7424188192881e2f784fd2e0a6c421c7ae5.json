The Trump administration played down a Bloomberg report the same day that the White House was weighing limits on U.S. portfolio flows into China.\n\nHere are some of Bremmer\u2019s other key takeaways from UN week:", "description": "Bremmer Says U.S.-China Trade War Getting \u2018Considerably Worse\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic78f0f68aead855ad93b4398f4627be0f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
