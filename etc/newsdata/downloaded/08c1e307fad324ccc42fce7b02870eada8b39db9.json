From giant balls and long spears to crystal clear cubes, ice has been essential to the rebirth of the cocktail.\n\nThat is, except, shaved ice. But Chicago bartender Kevin Beary is trying to change that.\n\nJust take a look at his unique twist on the classic Daiquiri that he serves at the Bamboo Room, a 22-seat oasis that opened last February, which is tucked inside acclaimed tiki bar Three Dots and Dash. You\u2019ll get a coupe filled with a heaping mound of pineapple-flavored shaved ice as fluffy as it is frosty. Next to it, you\u2019ll find an oversized clam shell with a rum-filled carafe nestled in a bed of ice. Pour the concoction into the glass and watch snow-like ice dissipate to perfectly fill the glass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an interactive service,\u201d says Beary . \u201cIt\u2019s almost looks like the way when you pour liquid on cotton candy\u2014the whole thing just like implodes into itself and you\u2019re left with this super light, almost slushy consistency in the cocktail.\u201d\n\nTo achieve this unusual and ultra-refreshing drink, Beary uses a hand-cranked, Japanese-designed Fujimarca MC 7-11 shaved ice machine. He first pulls a block of ice straight from the freezer, puts it in the machine and catches the shavings with a glass.\n\n\u201cIt has definitely been my jam as of late,\u201d says Beary, adding that he sourced the machine from Hawaii, where alcoholic and non-alcoholic shaved ice drinks are popular.\n\nBut his shaved ice doesn\u2019t just chill a drink, it\u2019s also an essential flavor element.\n\n\u201cTo make the [pineapple] snow we take cold-pressed pineapple juice, some filtered water and just a touch of cane syrup and then freeze that into the block,\u201d says Beary. He adds that as the ice incorporates into the drink, its flavor evolves. \u201cAs [the Daiquiri] sits, more and more of that pineapple flavor comes out into the cocktail.\u201d\n\nBeary first learned about the Japanese shaved ice machine and this technique from Dave Arnold, co-owner of New York\u2019s Existing Conditions, and author of seminal book Liquid Intelligence.\n\nAchieving the perfect consistency of ice is no simple chore. Beary says that he has to find the ideal ratio of sugar and juice to water so that it will freeze hard. Then, it\u2019s all about timing it right so that the ice can temper to the perfect temperature for shaving.\n\nThe bar\u2019s Daiquiri program has been very popular and one of the most successful drinks is a Manzanilla Sherry Daiquiri poured over a bed of pineapple snow. Another best seller is a Martinique rhum agricole based-Daiquiri served with cold-pressed watermelon ice.\n\nMoving into autumn and winter, Beary also hopes to incorporate richer ingredients into his cocktails using the shaved ice machine.\n\n\u201cWe have many other experimental blocks in the freezer right now,\u201d says Beary. \u201cWe\u2019re kind or trying to see how this works with a broader spectrum of flavors.\u201d\n\nThese trial blocks include things like amari and vermouth, but are a real test of his skills, since alcohol doesn\u2019t freeze well.\n\n\u201cYou have a limit of how much [liquor] you can put in the ice for it to freeze correctly,\u201d says Beary. \u201cEven though you can get something to freeze, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to make good snow. The more challenging you make the liquid with more suspended solids, the lesser quality of snow you wind up getting.\u201d\n\nBut, he says, it\u2019s worth pursuing, since he\u2019d like to figure out how to incorporate as many ingredients and flavors as possible into his shaved ice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sort of ruined us to do any other style of frozen cocktails without [the machine],\u201d says Beary. \u201cIt just works the best.\u201d", "description": "The Chicago bartender who runs the Bamboo Room\u2019s cocktail program is using a Japanese shaved ice machine to create exciting new takes on classic drinks.", "authors": ["Anna Archibald"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567560731/190904-rothbaum-half-full-kevin-beary-hero_etskuu", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
