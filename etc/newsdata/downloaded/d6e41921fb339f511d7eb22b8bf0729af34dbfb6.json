REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou/Pool\n\nEU negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart Stephen Barclay met over breakfast following a burst of optimism after the British and Irish prime ministers said on Thursday they had found \u201ca pathway\u201d to a possible deal.\n\nThe United Kingdom is due to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc on Oct. 31 and despite the flurry of activity, it remains unclear on what terms it will leave or indeed whether it will do so at all.\n\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d Barnier told reporters as he left the meeting and went on to brief the 27 EU states who will stay on. \u201cBrexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience.\u201d\n\nThe British government also said the meeting was constructive.\n\nAn EU spokeswoman said they were working towards a deal. No details were immediately disclosed, however.\n\nEarlier on Friday in the Cypriot capital Nicosia, European Council President Donald Tusk said he had received \u201cpromising signals\u201d from Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that a deal was still possible.\n\nBut he tempered this by saying: \u201cOf course, there is no guarantee of success and the time is practically up. But even the slightest chance must be used.\u201d\n\nDOWN TO THE WIRE\n\nSterling see-sawed on the various pronouncements, which came at the end of a tumultuous week in which Brexit negotiations have shifted wildly, starting with a public row between London and Brussels.\n\nBoth sides are anxious to avoid taking the blame should the deadline for Britain\u2019s departure arrive with no deal secured.\n\nTusk said he had previously told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that unless a workable solution came from London by Friday Oct. 11, he would announce that a deal was all but impossible at a summit of EU leaders next Thursday and Friday.\n\nVaradkar told Irish reporters on Thursday after his meeting with Johnson: \u201cI think it is possible for us to come to an agreement, to have a treaty agreed, to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion and to have that done by the end of October.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, the two leaders said they could \u201csee a pathway to a possible deal\u201d, though officials on both sides were silent about what compromises - if any - had been made to break the Brexit deadlock over Ireland\u2019s border.\n\nTo get a deal done, Johnson must overcome the complexities of the Irish border before getting the approval of Europe\u2019s biggest powers - and then sell any deal to the British parliament, which he suspended unlawfully last month and where he has no majority.\n\nParliament has passed a law saying that Britain cannot leave the bloc without a deal. Johnson, the face of the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, insists the country will leave on Oct. 31 with or without an agreement but he has not explained how that will be possible without defying parliament.\n\nThe Brexit issue has deeply polarised the country and many businesses fear they will be hit badly by a disorderly break with the EU in just a few weeks a time.\n\nEducation minister Gavin Williamson on Friday restated the government\u2019s line that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may, telling ITV: \u201cWe need to see the European Union shift.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nIreland is crucial if a deal is to be done to avert a potentially disorderly Brexit that would hurt global growth, roil financial markets and could even split the United Kingdom.\n\nDublin will have to consent to any solution to the hardest Brexit riddle of all: how to prevent the British province of Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s markets without having controls at the border.\n\nThe Irish border has been largely invisible since British army checkpoints were taken down after a 1998 peace deal largely ended the violence between members of the region\u2019s pro-British majority and an Irish nationalist minority.", "description": "The British and European Union chief Brexit negotiators held a \"constructive\" meeting in Brussels on Friday, both sides said, as efforts to secure a deal by Britain's scheduled departure date of Oct. 31 intensified.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439638145&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0U4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
