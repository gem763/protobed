He also is looking forward to seeing what developers will do with these new platforms. The Duo will run on Google's software for Android and the Neo will run on the latest Windows 10X, who well the two software ecosystems will play together remains to be seen.\n\nThe Neo is 5.6-mm thin and weighs 655 grams and it's surrounded by Gorilla glass. The Duo is smaller and fits right in your pocket.\n\nMost importantly, it has a 360-degree hinge with 60 cables as thin as strands of hair to bring the two 9-inch screens together. And the team has been designing and prototyping the Surface Neo for years.\n\nTo build upon that revolutionary hardware, the company is releasing Microsoft Windows 10X, which allows you to \"span\" an application across both screens on the Neo, or use the screens like two separate tablets. It almost mirrors the way we sometimes have two desktop monitors at our desks for work to increase productivity.\n\nWith that software, the screen is responsive if you want the screens stacked vertically, instead. That helps you to switch up your posture, whether you're at your desk, in bed or at the airport.\n\nWhen a keyboard is attached to one of the screens, a small portion of it still has a useable window.\n\nThe Surface Neo and Duo won't be available until the holiday season in 2020.\n\nToday we shared where Surface and Microsoft are...and where we're going. I hope you liked the products. We can't wait to see what you do with them #MicrosoftEvent #SurfacePro7 #SurfaceLaptop3 #SurfaceEarbuds #SurfaceNeo #SurfaceDuo pic.twitter.com/UIoW8SDPNN \u2014 Panos Panay (@panos_panay) October 2, 2019\n\nThe Other Surface Devices Coming This Year\n\nOutside of the foldable\u2014by far the most exciting part of the event\u2014Microsoft also unveiled its new Surface Laptop 3, which includes minute new details like an always-on display, silent typing and a 20 percent larger trackpad than the last Surface Laptop.\n\nEven more significantly, there's a removable hard drive and the entire top, including the keyboard, can slide right off with the right tools, making repairs far easier\u2014but don't just rip this apart at home.\n\n\"It is two times faster than the product that is already the highest consumer rated product,\" Panay said of the new Intel chip inside. He said it makes the computer three times more powerful than the MacBook Air.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 15-inch model was introduced for those that want more screen for productivity purposes. It'll cost $1,200 when it becomes available on October 22. The 13-inch model will run you $1,000.\n\nFast charging is also new. You can power up the new Surface to 80 percent in under an hour, at about the same rate as a mobile processor charging inside a smartphone. This feature will be available across the Surface product line, Panay said.\n\nThe new Microsoft Surface Pro 7 was also unveiled. It includes an improved pen and studio microphones that make it easier to utilize speech-to-text on both the Surface Pro and the new Surface Laptop. It's available for pre-order today and starts at $750.\n\nPhoto credit: Microsoft More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Microsoft just unleashed a deluge of devices and offered a compelling glimpse into its hardware future.", "authors": ["Courtney Linder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R8B1YecjNgTPLekC._y0Xg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/28fd44040626808d2602205fc92c4bbb", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
