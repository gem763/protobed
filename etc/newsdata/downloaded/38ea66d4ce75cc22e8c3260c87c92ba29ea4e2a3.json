The software giant unveiled a similar console last year with Taco Bell\u2019s signature \u201cring\u201d when it\u2019s powered on \u2014 and this console has the same ring \u2014 but this year Microsoft is bundling in the new Xbox Elite 2 controller, too.\n\nXbox fans will need to purchase Taco Bell\u2019s Double Chalupa Box to try and win this special bundle, dubbed the Xbox One X Eclipse Limited Edition. The promotion starts today, meaning if you\u2019re a lucky winner then you\u2019ll be able to get an Elite 2 controller well before its release on November 4th, and without the $179.99 price tag.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest Xbox Elite 2 controller includes new adjustable tension thumbsticks that can be tweaked using a tool to improve precision. The trigger grips have also been updated from the original Elite, alongside redesigned bumpers and shorter hair locks so you can fire faster in games. Microsoft has also updated the paddles and thumbsticks with more customization, and added USB-C and Bluetooth support.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be testing Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Elite 2 controller over the coming days to bring you a full review of exactly what\u2019s changed from the original. Stay tuned for a much closer look at the new Xbox Elite 2 controller.", "description": "A new Taco Bell Xbox promotion begins today", "authors": ["Tom Warren", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLRhwH43zSNzZdrA0TMctZo9Nes=/0x184:2640x1566/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19291888/twarren_xboxelite2_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
