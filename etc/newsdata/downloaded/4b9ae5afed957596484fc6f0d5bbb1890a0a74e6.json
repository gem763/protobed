Chinese and Vietnamese officials are now both working closely with British police, their respective embassies have said.\n\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in northern-central Vietnam's Nghe An province, 300km (180 miles) south of Hanoi, said he was liaising with family members of the victims.\n\n\"The whole district is covered in sorrow,\" Nam said, as prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the misty, rain-soaked town on Saturday.\n\n\"I'm still collecting contact details for all the victim's families, and will hold a ceremony to pray for them tonight.\"\n\n\"This is a catastrophe for our community.\"\n\nNam said families told him they knew relatives were travelling to the UK at the time and had been unable to contact their loved ones.\n\nVietnam's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that it had instructed its London embassy to assist British police with the identification of victims.\n\nThe ministry did not respond to a request for further comment regarding the nationalities of the dead.\n\nEssex Police declined to elaborate as to how they first identified the dead as Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\n'BEAUTIFUL DAY'\n\nIn Yen Thanh, Nghe An province, dozens of worried relatives of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung gathered in the family's small courtyard home where her worried mother has been unable to rise from her bed.\n\n\"She said she was in France and on the way to the UK, where she has friends and relatives,\" said Nhung's cousin, Hoang Thi Linh.\n\n\"We are waiting and hoping it's not her among the victims, but it's very likely. We pray for her everyday. There were two people from my village travelling in that group\".\n\nIn comments under a photo uploaded to Nhung's Facebook account on Monday, two days before the doomed truck was discovered, one friend asked how her journey was going.\n\n\"Not good,\" Nhung replied. \"Almost spring,\" she said, using a term in Vietnamese meaning she had almost reached her destination.\n\nOther photos on her account show her sightseeing in Brussels on Oct. 18.\n\n\"Such a beautiful day,\" Nhung posted.\n\nNghe An is one of Vietnam's poorest provinces, and home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.\n\nOther victims are believed to come from the neighbouring province of Ha Tinh, Nam said, where in the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left looking for work elsewhere, including overseas, according to state media.\n\nThe province was ravaged by one of Vietnam's worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries and sparking widespread protests.\n\nAnother suspected victim from Ha Tinh, 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, had sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain.\n\n\"That girl who said in her message that she couldn't breathe in the truck? Her parents can't breathe here at home,\" Nam said.
