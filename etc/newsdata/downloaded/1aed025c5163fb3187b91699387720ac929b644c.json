So excited to take them on an adventure later\n\n\"I hope you\u2019ve all had a lovely weekend and a very happy Sunday. Love you all\n\n\"P.S I definitely should have gone easier on the tan\n\n\"P.P.S I purposely picked out their clothes today (including Joes) so they\u2019d match but have no idea until we all stood together\"\n\n\"Life goals,\" Chanelle Hayes commented.\n\nWhile one fan told Stacey: \"You look beautiful\"\n\nAnother said: \"Gorgeous family photo\"\n\nAnd one dubbed the snap a \"Perfect family photo\".\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nStacey's picture captures the time of year perfectly, with her family posing up surrounded by orange flowers, browning leaves and stacks of pumpkins.\n\nFans have recently become convinced that Stacey and Joe are about to get engaged, and she's said she'd still like him to propose even though they might never get married.\n\nShe told new magazine: \"I want an engagement ring, but I'm not bothered about getting married.\n\n\"Neither of us are! I have those weird preset ideas that I should get married and have a big white dress but it's not the be all and end all. We have our family, we're together, we're practically married in our opinion.\n\n\"That piece of paper for us isn't something we feel we need right now.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
