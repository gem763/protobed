But holding your cat wrong could hurt it and stress it out, even if it doesn\u2019t visibly complain. The differences between a good hold and a bad hold aren\u2019t always obvious. We\u2019ve drawn all of the poses that Dr. Burstyn demonstrates, so you can hold your cat right \u2014 and show guests and kids how to hold it too.\n\nBasic holds\n\nThe most important thing is to support the cat\u2019s torso. Keep at least one hand under the cat\u2019s chest, pushing up on its body and not on its legs or joints.\n\nIn the leftmost drawing below, the cat\u2019s weight is hanging from its shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s not comfortable for the cat,\u201d says Dr. Burstyn. \u201cOr that safe, to be honest.\u201d\n\nIllustration: Angelica Alzona\n\nIn the two other holds, even if the cat is relatively vertical, its chest and belly are supported by your hands. You\u2019ll feel the difference, and so will the cat. You can give its front paws something to rest on, or let its paws hang. But in general, cats like to be held close and well-supported.\n\nEven when holding it in these correct positions, a nervous cat still has room to scratch you with its hind legs. To keep its legs still, bring the back of the cat in toward your torso, as in the middle drawing. Tuck its butt between your arm and body, while still supporting its chest with your hand.\n\nAdvanced holds\n\nThose aren\u2019t the only ways to hold your cat. As shown below, plenty of less obvious poses are still perfectly fine, as long as the cat wants to cooperate.\n\nOn the left is the baby pose, which Dr. Burstyn demonstrates in a follow-up video. This is safe and comfortable if you have a good relationship with the cat. But, he warns, \u201cI would not do this with any cat that I don\u2019t completely trust.\u201d Holding a cat like a baby opens you up to scratches from its front claws, so if your cat resists, gently put it down and try a more traditional hold.\n\nIn the middle is a football pose. Dr. Burstyn recommends this for quickly scooping up a resistant cat. By pulling the front of the cat in toward your body, and holding in its hind legs, you reduce the cat\u2019s range of movement (and thus its ability to scratch you or escape), while still supporting the body. Squish the cat close, says Dr. Burstyn. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to do them any harm; in fact, they tend to feel more safe and secure when they\u2019re being held tightly.\u201d\n\nIllustration: Angelica Alzona\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the shoulder hold. This is another pose reserved for cats and humans who have a trusting relationship. To get your cat on your shoulder, get your cat on a surface near waist level, then lean down toward it and allow it to climb up onto you. (You\u2019ll risk a little scratching as the cat puts its claws out to climb.) Support the cat\u2019s butt with your hand.\n\nIf the cat is comfortable on one shoulder, it might try to lie across both shoulders, behind your neck. You can let it (while risking some more inadvertent scratches), or you can keep it still by squishing its back into your shoulder with your other hand.\n\nTo let down a shoulder cat, don\u2019t pull it off or let it leap behind you. Get to a waist-high surface and lean forward until the cat relents and rights itself. (When Dr. Burstyn demonstrates with his cat Mr. Pirate, he has to lean all the way down to the exam table before the cat finally lets go.)", "description": "There are many good ways to hold a cat, some of which might surprise you, says friendly veterinarian Dr. Uri Burstyn in his most popular YouTube video.
