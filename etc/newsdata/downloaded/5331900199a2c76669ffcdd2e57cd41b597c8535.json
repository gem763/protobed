The end goal is to build a space colony inspired by a book he read in high school, The Atlantic's Franklin Foer reported in the magazine's November issue.\n\n\"The High Frontier\" explains physicist and Princeton professor Gerard K. O'Neill's \"three-pronged plan of Space Colonization, Space Solar Power and Large Scale Space Construction,\" according to the book's synopsis. O'Neill's plan includes building huge cylindrical tubes between Earth and the moon that would house colonies. Bezos once said the colonies would be like \"Maui on its best day, all year long,\" according to The Atlantic. \"No rain, no storms, no earthquakes.\"\n\nThe book is \"beloved by sci-fi geeks, NASA functionaries, and aging hippies,\" according to The Atlantic. Bezos even attended seminars taught by O'Neill at Princeton, The Atlantic reported.\n\n\"Through Blue Origin, Bezos is developing detailed plans for realizing O'Neill's vision,\" Foer wrote in The Atlantic.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company Axel Springer, Bezos outlined his goals for Blue Origin. The billionaire proposed relocating heavy industry to space, so Earth would become primarily residences. \"The Solar System can easily support a trillion humans,\" Bezos said. \"And if we had a trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts and unlimited \u2014 for all practical purposes \u2014 resources and solar power and so on. That's the world that I want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in.\"\n\nIn addition to lunar landers, the notoriously secretive Blue Origin is also developing a mostly reusable rocket system called New Glenn, which was designed to rival the Falcon Heavy rocket system built by Elon Musk's SpaceX.", "description": "The book that inspired Jeff Bezos' space plan calls for building huge cylindrical tubes between Earth and the moon that would house space colonies.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicole Rogers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db1e221dee019590e4635d5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
