We\u2019re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president.\n\nSign Up for Debatable\n\nAgree to disagree, or disagree better? We\u2019ll help you understand the sharpest arguments on the most pressing issues of the week, from new and familiar voices.\n\nAs these two processes unfold simultaneously, the contrast will be obvious. People will conclude that Democrats are going ahead with impeachment in an election year because they don\u2019t trust the democratic process to yield the right outcome. Democratic elites to voters: We don\u2019t trust you. Too many of you are racists!\n\nThis is not what the country wants to talk about. Pelosi said she would not proceed with impeachment unless there was a bipartisan groundswell of support. There is no bipartisan groundswell, and yet she\u2019s proceeding.
