The Chinese retaliate, aiming to punish American interests. The stock market drops, which prompts negotiations to resume, and the administration backs off the pledged escalation.\n\nFriday\u2019s events represent the latter stages of that cycle. It\u2019s particularly evident when you look at what the de-escalation consists of. The deal did not reduce tariffs already in place on Chinese imports but rather further delayed an increase that was announced during the escalation phase over the summer.\n\n\u201cThe only things we\u2019ve learned are that Trump loves tariffs and he doesn\u2019t have a long-term plan,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cAre these guys in markets like Charlie Brown and the football?\u201d\n\nThe central tensions between the United States and China \u2014 and the domestic political constraints on each side that stand in the way of an overarching deal \u2014 remain very much in place. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, cannot back away from goals of dominating many of the industries of the future; President Trump cannot acquiesce to those goals without huge political risks. The new \u201cphase one\u201d deal does not address one of the most fraught issues, around the ability of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to sell in the United States.\n\nMoreover, the recent history of American trade policy implies that even when a deal seems to be signed, sealed and delivered, it doesn\u2019t mean trade peace has been achieved.", "description": "A perpetual state of aggression on trade has been a drag on business decision-making, especially in manufacturing.", "authors": ["Neil Irwin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/upshot/11up-trade3/11up-trade3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
