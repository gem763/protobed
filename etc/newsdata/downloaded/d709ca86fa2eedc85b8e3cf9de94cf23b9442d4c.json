Mayor Pete Buttigieg's biggest, scariest monster has always been Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nMayor Pete has been taking shots at Pence for months now, engaged in a tug-of-war in which only one side of the rope is being pulled.\n\nAnd he still isn't winning.\n\nDeadline:\n\nWith the impeachment inquiry raising the possibility of Vice President Mike Pence elevating to the Oval Office, Pete Buttigieg talked about what to expect. \u201cNothing good,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told a friendly crowd at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on the Upper West Side, as he answered questions for about 90 minutes with New Yorker editor David Remnick as part of The New Yorker Festival. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., talked of working with Pence when he was governor of the state, and while they worked together on some issues like economic development, he found that Pence \u201cbelieves things that are completely fanatical. He really believes.\u201d But he said he\u2019s had a tough time squaring that with Pence\u2019s support of Trump.\n\nThese days, the Democrats love to insist that their unhinged criticism of President Trump is unique. Anyone with a memory knows that they are this awful to all Republicans who are in power, and the Myth of Mike Pence that they have created is a perfect example of that.\n\nPence is a thoughtful, religious, and decent man whom the Left -- especially the permanently-aggrieved LGBTQ crowd -- love to portray has one of history's greatest monsters.\n\nLike most devout Christians, Pence is opposed to same-sex marriage. It is a faith-based, principled opposition that Pence rarely mentions. As there is only room for emotion on the American Left, Pence is made out to be the scourge of gay people everywhere, seeking their destruction.\n\nButtigieg's battle with Pence is a pure media creation. Pence isn't indulging Mayor Pete's nonsense. Despite this unresponsiveness on the part of Pence, the vice president of the United States now has a secondary official residence: rent-free in Mayor Pete's head.\n\n___\n\nPJ Media Associate Editor Stephen Kruiser is the author of \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Hippies Shower\u201d and \u201cStraight Outta Feelings: Political Zen in the Age of Outrage,\u201d both of which address serious subjects in a humorous way.
