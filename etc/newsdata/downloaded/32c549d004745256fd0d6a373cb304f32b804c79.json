Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, who didn't qualify for Thursday night's presidential primary debate, says the Democratic National Committee\u2019s qualification system could be sowing distrust among voters.\n\nGabbard also called the debates \u201ckind of a charade,\u201d for their lack of substance.\n\nTULSI GABBARD SAYS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT WOULD 'TEAR COUNTRY APART'\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that this system lacks transparency,\u201d Gabbard told Dave Rubin on The Rubin Report, adding that this is problematic because \u201cit creates a lack of trust in Democratic voters that the DNC is actually working for their interest.\u201d\n\nGabbard has called out the DNC for its debate qualification standards before. Candidates must meet donation requirements as well as receive support from at least 2 percent of participants in four polls recognized by the committee. Gabbard accused the DNC of being unfair in deciding which polls qualify, and blamed this for her exclusion from Thursday's event in Houston.\n\nShe voiced concern that the DNC\u2019s lack of transparency when it comes to how they determine the qualification system could discourage voters from even taking part in primary races.\n\nKNIVES OUT AS DEMS GATHER FOR THIRD DEBATE\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got lack of trust, then you\u2019ve got people who wonder whether they should even be involved at all, whether or not they should show up to the caucuses and the primaries if the fix is already in.\u201d\n\nGabbard also lamented the nature of the debates and the focus on which candidates come up with entertaining quips, rather than on in-depth discussions of issues that could be informative for viewers. This, though Gabbard herself gaining attention from a viral moment in the second debate round, when she blasted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., for her record as a prosecutor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThese debates end up being kind of a charade about providing a transparent process for voters to become educated, but none of that\u2019s actually happening,\u201d she said.\n\nGabbard appears to be having better luck in potentially qualifying for October\u2019s debate. She has already met the donor requirement and has met the necessary threshold in two out of four polls so far.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Rep.
