Every day,\u201d Tom Pan, who owns a nail salon, told The Examiner. \u201cThe police cannot do anything, it\u2019s dirty and disgusting. In the summertime on a hot day, I can\u2019t even open my window because of the smell.\"\n\nAfter a few days, the blockade to what\u2019s known as the \u201cIngleside Path\u201d was removed after several complaints.\n\nNeighbors plan to meet Wednesday to discuss putting up a gate, KGO reported.\n\nResidents in the Clinton Park area of the city have also installed sidewalk boulders meant to keep the homeless from erecting tents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn May, city officials braced themselves when a preliminary homeless count was released. They expected the numbers to rise and they were right. Initial data showed that it had jumped 17 percent from 2017. The double-digit growth was bad enough \u2014 but then it got a whole lot worse.\n\nWhen the final report was released a couple of months later, it showed the street count increase would have been 30 percent if the city had stuck to the same definition of homelessness as they had in the past. This year, San Francisco opted to use the federal definition instead of the one they wrote themselves.\n\nFox News' Barnini Chakraborty contributed to this report.", "description": "A San Francisco resident recently blocked an alleyway known to be used for drug deals and defecation by the homeless with a plywood wall in the latest effort to combat the growing homelessness crisis in the city.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/SFHomeless20iStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
