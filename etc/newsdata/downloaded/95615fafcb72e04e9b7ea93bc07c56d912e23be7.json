Our panelists' verdict", "language": "en", "text": "Nathan Robinson: \u2018Biden did better but remains a liability\n\nThe consensus will probably be that Julian Castro distinguished himself in Thursday\u2019s debate, thanks to some forceful talk on immigration, a good story about hard ethical choices, and some deliciously salty exchanges with Joe Biden. Biden himself did better than before, which isn\u2019t saying much. There were still painful moments, especially a downright bizarre ramble delivered in response to a question on his racial record\u2014Biden implied that black parents need instructions on how to raise children, told people to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night,\u201d and then started talking about Venezuela for no reason at all. I continue to believe he is a political liability who should under no circumstances be nominated.\n\nBernie had some excellent answers on foreign policy and democratic socialism, sadly made less forceful thanks to a hoarse voice. Unfortunately, he was also denied the chance to say anything about climate change, meaning he couldn\u2019t explain the urgent need for a Green New Deal.\n\nWarren distinguished herself as an explainer of progressive policies and effectively replied to the line about people wanting to \u201ckeep their insurance\u201d by saying \u201cI\u2019ve never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d Kamala Harris continues to duck tough questions about her atrocious record as a prosecutor, Amy Klobuchar continues to offer uninspiring centrist clich\u00e9s, Beto O\u2019Rourke continues to emphasize guns and racism, Andrew Yang gets ever closer to becoming Matthew Lesko, and Cory Booker continues to be personally endearing without offering any reason to vote for him. Oh, and please: no more three-hour debates. They are truly unendurable.\n\nNathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs and a columnist for The Guardian US\n\nLloyd Green: \u2018For Democrats, 2020 can\u2019t arrive quickly enough\u2019\n\nJoe Biden came out swinging hard but then struggled to stay focused in the third hour. Still, his swipes at Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were effective. Warren refused to own up to the cost of her single-payer healthcare plan; as for Sanders, he was reminded that \u201csocialist\u201d can be a putdown. Biden\u2019s line, \u201cI\u2019m with Barack, Elizabeth is with Bernie\u201d is here to stay.\n\nKamala Harris also did well. Her tart Wizard of Oz description of President Trump, \u201cWhen you pull back the curtain it\u2019s a really small dude\u201d, got the audience\u2019s attention.\n\nPresidents Obama and Trump were also winners. This time, the candidates on stage repeatedly sang Obama\u2019s praises on his healthcare reform. As for Trump, he had to be smiling when Julian Castro angrily taunted Biden over his age. For the Democrats, 2020 can\u2019t arrive quickly enough.\n\nLloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992\n\nJessa Crispin: \u2018I miss Marianne Williamson\u2019\n\nBiden as the Democratic frontrunner only makes sense if noone is watching any of his media appearances or these debates: he spends half his time stuttering, digressing, and bleeding from sensory organs.\n\nEveryone on stage on Thursday agreed on which issues are important and squabbled about how they will all magically solve intractable problems like health care, gun control, and environmental devastation. The only fun left here is guessing who leaves the race next. Well, that and figuring out why Kamala Harris, who kept giggling at her own awkward jokes, had such a strong wine mom energy tonight.\n\nI miss Marianne Williamson. While everyone else argues about whose plan is going to actually raise taxes the most, she spoke to the deep issues of apathy, loss of authority, and weariness with a system that spends a year making big promises and then spends four years explaining why those promises are all impossible to achieve.\n\nIf Biden is the Democratic future, responding to every mass shooting with an Oh Jeez and every diplomatic crisis with a \u201cgot your nose\u201d joke, I want at least one person talking about why this is a joke too many.\n\nJessa Crispin is the author of Why I am a Not a Feminist\n\nMalaika Jabali: \u2018No clear winners \u2013 but better moderators\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Democratic debate hosts continue their disingenuous framing of socialism and the left, from asking loaded questions about what distinguishes Bernie Sanders from Venezuela\u2019s Nicholas Maduro to repeating conservative talking points about Medicare for All. The debates are becoming increasingly redundant, with few revelations materializing among them. However, moderators Linsey Davis and Jorge Ramos asked tough questions that were a welcome shift from the tone of previous debates.\n\nDavis unflinchingly confronted Biden on his positions on racial equality and disinterest in reparations, and she directly called out Kamala Harris\u2019 criminal justice record. Likewise, Jorge Ramos keyed in on Biden\u2019s support for the Obama administration\u2019s deportations of 3 million people.\n\nAs the debate was 3 hours long, there should have been plenty of time to follow up on these questions, instead half of the first hour was spent re-litigating Medicare for All. While there were no clear winners, and the frontrunners\u2019 positions will likely change little after tonight, at least a few pointed questions forced some to contend with their records.\n\nMalaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, writer, and activist\n\nArt Cullen: \u2018Beto had a tremendous night\u2019\n\nThe best moment in all the debate was when Joe Biden made his closing remarks, speaking of resilience against all his tremendous personal loss: \u201cFaith sees best in the dark. You find purpose in what you do. I stayed engaged.\u201d Going up against that, Julian Castro looked small nipping at Biden\u2019s heels by suggesting that he was forgetful.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke had a tremendous night, the best on stage, with accolades all around and the most applause from the crowd for championing gun safety and condemning racism with passion, calling Trump a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d \u201cWould you take away their guns? \u201cHell yes,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take away your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren maintained her momentum with cogent riffs on trade, Afghanistan, health care and corruption. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s Midwestern appeals for pragmatism will echo for voters looking for relief from chaos. She stayed in the fray.", "description": "Another combative Democratic debate saw clashes between Joe Biden and his opponents \u2013 but no clear winner emerged", "authors": ["Nathan Robinson", "Lloyd Green", "Jessa Crispin", "Malaika Jabali", "Art Cullen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fbeaa35951784b02dafc96ddcd337fa249ea30c/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=52c2825abf0abc403e9753b8e2ec40e9", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
