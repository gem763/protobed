Others will slate their feminism because it doesn\u2019t apply to anyone who isn\u2019t hot.\n\nThe argument is a microcosm for a bigger battle about women\u2019s bodies and who gets to own them. And interestingly, Kim Kardashian West herself underlined this very question on Sunday, during a fiery exchange with her husband, Kanye West.\n\nOn the show\u2019s latest episode, West admitted that he thought Kardashian West\u2019s 2019 Met gala dress was \u201ctoo sexy\u201d. (The dress was famously designed to make Kardashian West look like she was dripping wet.) West said he had gone through a \u2018\u201ctransition\u201d since his rapper days, when he was obsessed with wanting his wife to look good for others. Fast forward to today, and the dress is too much for him.\n\nComing from a man who spent years talking about and profiting from his wife\u2019s body, you can see why a few eyebrows are being raised. When asked about their romance by the radio host Angie Martinez in 2013, West said he fell in love with Kardashian West after seeing a photo of her with Paris Hilton. He bragged that she was one of the most beautiful women \u201carguably of human existence\u201d.\n\nSo it sounded pretty rich when he confessed on the show on Sunday: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was affecting my soul and my spirit \u2026 You\u2019re my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy!\u201d\n\nDoes life get any harder than this?\n\nIn response, Kardashian West reminded him: \u201cYou built me up to be this sexy person, confident and all this stuff. Just because you\u2019re on a journey of transformation does not mean I\u2019m in the same spot with you.\u201d\n\nWhatever you think of Kardashian West, we should applaud her for summing up the biggest problem with the beauty standard on women in one sentence. The very reason some people hate her \u2013 that she encourages a body ideal that requires self-torture for most people to attain \u2013 is perpetuated by men like West.\n\nIt was perpetuated when he dedicated an entire music video to how great Kardashian West\u2019s silhouette looks on a motorbike; and it is perpetuated when, having achieved the body ideal, West berates her for being too sexy.\n\nShe was right to call him out for being a hypocrite. All we can do now is hope that his spirit and soul can overcome it.", "description": "The rapper said Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 2019 Met gala dress, designed to make her look wet, affected his \u2018soul and spirit\u2019", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f331a4f536b2c1b09700262b524e98a044ced3e/0_20_7419_4451/master/7419.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=39fa015f5fa494b7f4edfd75cbc6dae8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
