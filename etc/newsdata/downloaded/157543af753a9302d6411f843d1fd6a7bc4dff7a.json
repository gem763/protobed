Biden during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBut he insisted he did nothing wrong, calling the conversation \u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d and that he delayed aid to the Eastern European nation because other countries weren\u2019t offering a fair share.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,\u201d Mr. Trump told White House reporters as he left for a rally in Texas.\n\n\u201cThe new president is saying that he\u2019s going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing, we had a great conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d to cooperate with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, over a possible nexus between the son\u2019s business interests and the vice president\u2019s push in 2016 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor, Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\n\nThe conversation is at the heart of a whistleblower complaint the Trump administration is keeping out of the hands of Congress.\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Trump should be transparent and hand over details of the call, if he did nothing wrong.\n\nMore ominously, they fear Mr. Trump held up $250 million in Ukrainian aid \u2014 it was released Sept. 12 \u2014 as part of an attempt to extract dirt on the Democratic presidential frontrunner, Mr. Biden, who leads Mr. Trump in many 2020 polls.\n\nMr. Trump said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d with Mr. Giuliani testifying to Congress about his recent meetings with Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cRudy is a very straight shooter and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people with respect to Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nHe also questioned the whistleblower\u2019s motives, saying president\u2019s should be free to speak to foreign leaders and \u201cyou can\u2019t have people doing this.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community who received the complaint deemed it a credible and urgent matter, yet the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire won\u2019t turn over the complaint to lawmakers.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and other Democrats say if Mr. Trump used the presidency to try and damage a political opponent, it will have serious ramifications that may include impeachment.\n\nA Senate Republican, Sen. Pat Toomey, was more circumspect but did suggest it would be wrong of a president to seek a political leg up from a foreign nation.\n\n\u201cLook, it is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office, certainly, including a sitting president, to ask for assistance from a foreign country,\u201d Mr. Toomey, of Pennsylvania, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate. But I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what happened here.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump eventually released about $250 million in military aid to Ukraine, plus $140 million more.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was in conversations about Ukrainian aid and no one tied it to the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThere was no connection,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThat issue never came up.\u201d\n\nMr. Mnuchin said the president shouldn\u2019t be forced to turn over details of the call to Congress.\n\n\u201cThese are confidential discussions between world leaders,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump said the pressure should be on the former vice president to explain himself, pointing to Mr. Biden\u2019s claim he never spoke about business with his son despite evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son. Does anybody believe that one?\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, potentially raising the controversy to a new level.\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Zelensky was bewildered by Mr. Giuliani\u2019s entreaties and the delay in aid money, though Mr. Trump said Sunday he was just worried the U.S. was shouldering too much of the burden.\n\n\u201cI backed Ukraine from the beginning, but I\u2019m very upset that other countries aren\u2019t doing the same,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cGermany should be spending much more, France, all of the European Union should be spending money. Why are we spending money and they\u2019re not? Or at least they\u2019re spending very little by comparison, so I\u2019m not happy about that.\u201d\n\nHe also highlighted a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister, who said their country did not feel pressured by the U.S. during the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful, warm, nice conversation. It was put out last night also by Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nDemocrats say they cannot rely on that statement, since Ukraine is being put in an awful diplomatic position and is beholden to the administration for aid money.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
