It's Murphy's worst-reviewed show since 2012's \"The New Normal,\" which has a 55% critic score and was canceled after one season. The two shows are the only ones of Murphy's to be designated \"rotten\" on the review aggregator.\n\nREAD MORE: The 10 biggest snubs and surprises of this year's Emmys\n\n\"The Politician\" centers on wealthy high schooler Payton (played by Platt), who is determined to become President of the United States one day.\n\n\"'The Politician' isn't actually interested in politics,\" Indiewire's Ben Travers wrote. \"It's interested in scheming and melodrama, which would be fine if it wasn't so ostensibly obsessed with using the broken system of government referred to in its title to prop up its plot. What results is a shallow character study supported by equally flimsy ties to important-sounding ideas.\"\n\nRolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall called the show \"mean, nonsensical, and utterly hollow.\"\n\n\"Moments when anyone onscreen emotionally resembles a person are rare,\" he added.\n\nMurphy \u2014 who is known for hit shows like FX's \"Pose\" and \"American Horror Story,\" and Fox's \"Glee\" \u2014 struck a five-year deal with Netflix last year worth up to $300 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhile \"The Politician\" has received poor reviews from critics, his past work showcases why Netflix signed him to such an extravagant contract. Most recently, \"Pose\" was nominated for six Emmy awards and won the trophy for best actor in a drama series (Billy Porter).
