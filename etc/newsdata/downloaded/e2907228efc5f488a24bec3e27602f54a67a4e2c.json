It happened on September 22 too, when Aston Villa visited. Villa were leading 2-1 at the time, then Xhaka was substituted and serenaded by boos. Arsenal, despite being down to 10 men, went on to win 3-2 without the midfielder. Then five days later, Unai Emery names Xhaka as captain anyway. Emery is as much to blame as anyone. If you let the players pick their skipper, then it becomes a popularity contest and that is not what leadership is about. I\u2019ve never had a manager who decided the captaincy that way and, for me, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still the safer bet.\n\nBut it looks likely the players' opinion will also be gauged before a decision is made.\n\nThe position of club captain is not viewed as important on the continent as it is here in England, Emery's decision to let the players vote on who should wear the armband underlines that view.\n\nBut there are concerns from within the club that Emery has misjudged the importance of the captaincy since his arrival at the start of last season.\n\nThere is understood to be a reluctance to strip Xhaka of the captaincy from within the technical staff - despite Emery admitting the former Borussia Monchengladbach star was 'wrong' to react in the way he did on Sunday.\n\nHowever, if Xhaka was to decide he no longer wanted to retain the captaincy, sources claim Emery would accept his decision.\n\nThere are concerns that Emery has misjudged the importance of the captaincy since his arrival\n\nThere was hope within the corridors of power at the Emirates Stadium on Monday that Xhaka would say sorry for his actions on Sunday.\n\nBut an a public apology was not forthcoming last night despite attempts from inside the club for Xhaka to break his silence.\n\nSpaniards Hector Bellerin and Dani Ceballos both took to social media on Monday to call on fans to support the side following the toxic atmosphere on Sunday.\n\nHowever, Sportsmail understands Emery is facing difficulties in totally convincing his player of his methods.\n\nSources claim there is often confusion from members of the playing staff over Emery's instructions on a day-to-day basis at the training ground and during matches.\n\nThere is also a concern among the squad that his tactics have severely stifled a team that was once famed for its creativity.\n\nEmery's marginalisation of Mesut Ozil has also been privately questioned by some players\n\nIndeed, his complete marginalisation of Mesut Ozil has been privately questioned by a contingent of players who believe the German still has quality to offer in certain games.\n\nIt all leaves Emery facing a huge challenge to fully convince the Gunners hierarchy that he is the right man to lead the club beyond this season.\n\nEmery's job is under no immediate threat - and it won't be while the Gunners remain in contention for a top four place.\n\nBut the Spaniard's position will come under significant threat if he fails to qualify for the Champions League next season.", "description": "Emery is fearful of a player backlash should he decide to strip the Switzerland international of the club captaincy given Xhaka's standing as one of the most popular members of the squad.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/20/20296736-0-image-a-62_1572295295003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
