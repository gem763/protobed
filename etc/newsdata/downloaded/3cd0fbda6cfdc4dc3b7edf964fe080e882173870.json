Rostem Akman via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27)\n\nUpdated records: Matthews (15-4 MMA, 8-4 UFC), Akman (6-2 MMA, 0-2 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Matthews landed four times as many strikes as Akman, who hit just 14 percent of what he threw.\n\nMatthews on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cThe game plan was to take him down. I heard the announcer say he was a good striker, so I decided to strike with him. That\u2019s how Aussies do it.\u201d\n\nMatthews on fans thinking he played it safe\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the fans to understand, but if he was a top-10 fighter, I would have swung for the fences. This was a very dangerous fight for me. He\u2019s a relative newcomer and I\u2019ve been here for 12 fights. I had to show that maturity and experience. I felt completely in control. Most of my fights are a blur, but this one I was aware of everything going on. I\u2019m very happy with that. I got the win, which is the main thing.\u201d\n\nMatthews on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI asked for Carlos Condit this fight, but I know he\u2019s fighting Mickey Gall next. So once Carlos is done smashing Mickey, I\u2019d like to have that legend fight.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Matthews, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Jake Matthews def.
