What is it all about? We asked Ramy Inocencio to file this Sunday Journal.\n\nFrom peaceful protests, to firebombs and gunshots, this has been Hong Kong's summer of discontent.\n\n\"If we don't fight there's no future for us,\" said Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai. Smuggled out of China at the age of 13 in a fishing boat, he's now one of Hong Kong's billionaire tycoons, supporting the protests, with young people leading the way.\n\n\"This movement is going to be persisting, because it's a movement of martyrdom,\" Lai said.\n\nHong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years, ceded to the U.K. from China in the 1800s. It grew from fishing village to modern economic miracle: rich, respected, and full of Western institutions.\n\nClaudia Mo works in one of them, elected as a pro-democracy legislator. \"Hong Kong people have managed to learn about universal values, human rights, democracy, rule of law,\" Mo said. \"The writing has been on the wall, and the Hong Kong people didn't realize, didn't know or didn't pay enough attention to it.\"\n\nAnti-extradition demonstrators march for democratic reforms in Hong Kong, China July 21, 2019. Tyrone Siu/REUTERS\n\nThe roots of this struggle date back to 1997, when the U.K. handed Hong Kong back to China. The U.K. and China agreed Hong Kong would be semi-autonomous, in charge of its internal affairs until 2047. That's when the city is set to revert to full Chinese rule.\n\nBut for now, Beijing has the power to appoint who runs for Hong Kong's chief executive, its top leader. \"The power is not with the people in Hong Kong; the power lies in Beijing,\" Mo said. \"That's the 'Big Brother,' the big boss.\"\n\nInocencio asked activist Bonnie Leung, \"What was the government doing that inspired you to start getting active?\"\n\n\"At first of course it was the extradition bill,\" Leung replied.\n\nThat bill, backed by Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam, would have given Beijing the power to extradite people locals and foreigners in Hong Kong to China's legal system, described by critics as corrupt.\n\nThe protests began in June \u2013 at first peacefully, with a million-person march organized by Leung and the Civil Human Rights Front. \"We all know that legally Hong Kong will be part of China, but what we really want to do is preserve our system that we had enjoyed all our lives,\" said Leung.\n\nTear gas is fired upon pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. CBS News\n\nThe weeks stretched to months. Violence on both sides ratcheted up, spreading to the legislature, the airport, and the subways.\n\nRiot police repelled angry crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\nMo said, \"This is essentially a large bunch of young people in Hong Kong fighting for democracy.\"\n\nThe demonstrators added to their grievances, demanding the resignation of Carrie Lam, amnesty for arrested protesters, and an independent probe into police brutality.\n\nLeung said, \"They literally beat up not only protesters but normal Hong Kong people, innocent people, every single day.\"\n\nNot everyone champions the protests. Regina Ip is a pro-Beijing lawmaker, and supported the extradition law. She also supports the police.\n\n\"Our economy is bleeding,\" Ip said. \"A lot of people will lose their jobs. \u2026 Currently the priority, you know, must be to help the government bring back order, because Hong Kong is suffering tremendous reputational damage.\"\n\nThis past week, Carrie Lam finally blinked. In a public address she said the government would formally withdraw the extradition bill.\n\nBut critics say it's too little, too late. Gavin told Inocencio that he, like many other protesters, will continue marching: \"Yes, I'm still going to fight for freedom.\"\n\nHe's even written a will. He keeps it a secret from his family, in his backpack, with instructions if he's killed.\n\nInocencio asked, \"If you die, is it worth it?\"\n\n\"It's worth it because I'm doing the right thing,\" Gavin replied.\n\nClaudia Mo, a mother of two, was asked how she feels about such precautions. \"They think they have nothing to lose, and they've been carrying letters to their parents or brothers and sisters in their rucksack saying that \u2026 \" She became emotional, and declined to speak further. \"No, I can't do this.\"\n\nThere are fears this could come to a bloody climax: just across the border, Chinese paramilitary forces have moved people and equipment into place, and state media has broadcast troops staging drills in which they suppress \"riots.\"\n\nSupporters of Beijing say it's just saber-rattling.\n\nRegina Ip believes the show of force is meant as a deterrent: \"A shot across the bow.\"\n\nBut Hong Kong remembers history in a way mainland China was never allowed.\n\nBonnie Leung said, \"We all know what happened 30 years ago in Tiananmen Square. China's government isn't particularly known for loving their own people, but they're known for killing their own people.\"\n\nThis weekend, protesters again took to the streets, standing up for what they believe, they say, no matter the cost.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Alan Golds and Erin Lyall.", "description": "Despite concessions from the government, the months-long movement in which millions have marched shows no signs of letting up \u2013 even while carrying the memory of Tiananmen Square", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/08/dae99aec-54c9-47cb-9d6b-7de658119773/thumbnail/1200x630/c49476f65d1ee86f23480cf3bf632256/hong-kong-protest-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
