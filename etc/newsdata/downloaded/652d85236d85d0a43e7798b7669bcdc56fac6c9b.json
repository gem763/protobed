The Vatican said local organisers had estimated the crowd at about a million people.\n\nAs he has since the start of his three country swing through sub-Saharan Africa, Francis spoke out about the gap between the haves and have-nots on the continent. He has already visited Mozambique and will move on to Mauritius on Monday.\n\nFrancis decried a clan culture that provided a boost only to those connected to it while leaving many others permanently excluded, or at best marginalised without opportunities to improve their lives.\n\n\u201cWhen \u2018family\u2019 becomes the decisive criterion for what we consider right and good, we end up justifying and even\n\n\u2018consecrating\u2019 practices that lead to the culture of privilege and exclusion: favouritism, patronage and - as a consequence - corruption,\u201d the pontiff said in his homily.\n\nMadagascar is the world\u2019s fourth largest island and one of its poorest countries.\n\nThe U.N. World Food Programme estimates that more than 90% of Madagascar\u2019s 26 million population live on less than $2 a day, with chronic child malnutrition widespread.\n\nCorruption is rampant among the country\u2019s political and business class, according to organisations such as Transparency International, which ranks Madagascar in the lowest quarter of its global Corruption Perceptions Index.\n\n\u201cAs we look around us, how many men and women, young people and children are suffering and in utter need!\u201d the pope said.\n\nWhile in Antananarivo, Francis\u2019s motorcade passed by people plying trades like metalworking and carpentry on the sides of dusty roads, followed minutes later by walled-off, European-style villas with gardens and pools.\n\nFrancis has often called for greater income equality and a fairer distribution of wealth between prosperous and developing countries, and he has defended the right of countries to control their mineral resources.\n\nAfter the Mass, Francis was due to visit Akamasoa, a district of the capital known as \u201cThe City of Friendship.\u201d\n\nIt was founded by Father Pedro Opeka, a 71-year-old missionary who studied theology under the future pope in their native Argentina before dedicating his life to building communities for the families of Madagascar.\n\nOver the last 50 years, an organisation founded by Opeka has built homes for 25,000 people, 100 schools, six clinics and two football stadiums. Next year they plan to build a college for paramedics.", "description": "Pope Francis, on a visit to Madasgascar, on Sunday condemned what he said was its clan culture of privilege and corruption that allows a very few to live in wealth while the vast majority languish in grinding poverty.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Hereward Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427539666&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870AN-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
