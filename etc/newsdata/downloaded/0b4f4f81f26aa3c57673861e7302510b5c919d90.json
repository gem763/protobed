And it smells pretty bad. An 18 per cent fall in pre-tax profits and a 3 per cent fall in revenues. Asia did OK (earnings were up by 4 per cent) and it might have been better still without the turmoil in Hong Kong and the US-China trade war.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously Brexit, which won\u2019t have helped the bank\u2019s commercial and City businesses in the UK. But it would probably still have looked a bit rubbish even without that, as did the European and US businesses. Given its franchise, HSBC should be doing better all-round.\n\nQuinn says he wants to \u201cre-model the bank\u201d. That\u2019s his pitch. His big idea. What it means in practice is that he\u2019s going to swing the axe. Thousands of jobs would be set to go.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. When I was discussing this story with a colleague their response was this: \u201cIsn\u2019t that what HSBC has been doing for the past 10 years?\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

So has Ewen Stevenson. He\u2019s the bank\u2019s current finance director, but has only been with it since January having been hired from RBS. So he\u2019d be a compromise, a sort of internal/external hire. Coming from RBS, he\u2019d know a thing or two about turbulence and restructuring.\n\nInevitably, people have been looking at JP Morgan, a bank that turns everyone connected with HSBC green with envy given how it has zoomed past and now seems to be on a completely different (and much faster) road. Could Tucker poach a member of its senior management team?\n\nFairly or not, this dismal set of results will increase the pressure on him to do that, or to look to another of the external names in the frame, to undertake the \u201cremodelling\u201d Quinn thinks HSBC needs, regardless of how much he likes the latter.", "description": "HSBC\u00a0looked like an Olympic archer stepping up to shoot having first consumed two bottles of neat Scotch when presenting its third-quarter results: it missed the target with just about every shot.\u00a0 If there were numbers\u00a0among the reams of them\u00a0analysts have to produce that the bank managed to hit\u00a0it was probably more through luck than judgment.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/28/08/hsbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
