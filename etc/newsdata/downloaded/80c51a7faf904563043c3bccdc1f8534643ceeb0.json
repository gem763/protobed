That\u2019s what you work for,\u201d said Mendick, whose home run landed in the home bullpen. He planned to give the baseball to his parents.\n\nMendick, Matt Skole and James McCann had two hits apiece for the White Sox, who avoided a three-game sweep.\n\nMichael Hermosillo had two hits in the ninth spot for the Angels, who finished with five hits without injured Mike Trout and have lost 17 of their last 22 road games.\n\nMendick, who made his major league debut Tuesday, hit a solo shot in the fifth to give the White Sox a 3-1 lead. He started in place of Anderson, who began the day leading the AL with a .334 average.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the easiest road,\u201d Mendick said of his career. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a first-rounder, didn\u2019t have a big name. Being able to do it, I think everyone really likes it and enjoys to see it.\u201d\n\nYolmer Sanchez had an RBI single in the sixth and Ryan Cordell added a sacrifice fly in the seventh to extend the lead.\n\nJosh Osich (2-0) threw 2 2/3 scoreless innings to pick up the victory. He combined with two other relievers to limit the Angels to one hit in 5 2/3 shutout innings. Right fielder Cordell fell into the net making a catch in the ninth.\n\nLos Angeles used six relievers.\n\nAbreu hit a solo homer an estimated 462 feet to put the White Sox ahead in the third. His career-high 112 RBIs lead the AL.\n\nJaime Barria (4-8) allowed both home runs in 4 1/3 innings for the Angels and hasn\u2019t won since July 24.\n\nShohei Ohtani singled to drive in the Angels\u2019 run in the first. He is 12 for 28 with nine RBIs in seven games against the White Sox this season. He went 1 for 4 with three strikeouts after going 3 for 5 with a career-high five RBIs on Saturday.\n\nMcCann\u2019s RBI single tied it at 1 in the first. Opener Noe Ramirez recorded just two outs.\n\nThe Angels left the bases loaded in the first and second innings.\n\nDylan Cease allowed a run and struck out four but walked five and threw 88 pitches in 3 1/3 innings for the White Sox, who had lost nine of 11.\n\n\u201cWe certainly had our chances against Cease early on,\u201d Angels manager Brad Ausmus said.\n\nCELEBRATION\n\nMendick said his teammates were excited for his first homer after pranking him Thursday, when he got his first major league hit, a single, at Cleveland.\n\n\u201cThey threw the fake ball in the stands when I got my first hit, so they were like, \u2018We\u2019ll take it easy this time,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nANOTHER FIRST\n\nHermosillo, a rookie recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake a week ago, recorded his first career multihit game.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAngels: Trout (right toe soreness) was scratched from the lineup and is listed as day to day. He was available to pinch hit. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t a ton of improvement overnight,\u201d Ausmus said. \u201cFor some reason, sometimes he can come back the next day and it feels fine and other times it takes a little longer for the soreness to get out of there.\u201d \u2026 OF Justin Upton (calf tightness) was held out of the lineup due to the rainy conditions. \u2026 INF Tommy La Stella (broken right tibia) still has soreness in his leg. La Stella has been taking live batting practice, fielding groundballs and throwing. The Angels have no timetable for his return. \u2026 C Max Stassi (side) sat out the series and will get evaluated when the Angels return home Monday.\n\nWhite Sox: Manager Rick Renteria (shoulder surgery) is expected to return Tuesday. Bench coach Joe McEwing said Renteria will not throw batting practice because his arm is in a sling.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: LHP Patrick Sandoval (0-2, 4.91 ERA) is scheduled to start Monday against visiting Cleveland and RHP Shane Bieber (13-7, 3.24). Sandoval has a 2.89 ERA at home.\n\nWhite Sox: After a day off, RHP Ivan Nova (9-12, 4.69) is scheduled to start against visiting Kansas City and RHP Jakob Junis (9-12, 4.94) on Tuesday. Nova is 5-3 with a 2.40 ERA in his last nine starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With AL batting leader Tim Anderson getting a day off, rookie Danny Mendick took advantage of a chance to fill in at shortstop.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sarah Trotto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/angels_white_sox_baseball_37138_c0-265-6336-3959_s1770x1032.jpg?7ad3f755c6fba9bf0bf33fbac155ebd284a81998", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
