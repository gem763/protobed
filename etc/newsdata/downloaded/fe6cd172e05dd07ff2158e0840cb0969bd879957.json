The company said it\u2019s working on a roadmap marked with \u201ccontroller clips, mobile-first controllers, and other hardware optimized for phones and tablets,\u201d and is partnering with accessory brands like 8bitDo, Gamevice, HORI, and Razer to bring gaming gadgets to the market.\n\nThe officially licensed PowerA MOGA Mobile Gaming Clip for Xbox works with any Xbox wireless controller and any phone that\u2019s up to 7.92 cm wide (for reference, the massive OnePlus 7 Pro, with a 6.67-inch display, comes in under 7.6cm).\n\nCredit: Microsoft PowerA\u2019s controller Clip has two articulating points that you can adjust to angle your phone the way you like\n\nThat\u2019s similar to most other controller clips that have been available for years, so you\u2019re not really getting new tech. However, this clip seems worth a look, since it has two adjustable articulation points so you can tweak exactly how your phone is angled towards you. At $15, it\u2019s a bit pricier than many well-reviewed alternatives on Amazon, most of which come in at around $10.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategy will make sense once game streaming services start to gain acceptance. While PS Now has been around for a while, it hasn\u2019t really made a huge splash or gained a massive audience, and Google recently noted its Stadia hardware pre-order shipments may be delayed past their expected date of November 19. And only real-world tests at scale will tell us if this tech is ready for prime time in the immediate future \u2014 so stay tuned to learn whether you\u2019ll actually be able to ditch your console soon.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
