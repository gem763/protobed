He was 78.\n\nForster starred in the Quentin Tarantino flick \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d earning him an Academy Award nomination for his role as bail bondsman Max Cherry.\n\nThe actor\u2019s most recent appearance came in the Netflix film \u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,\u201d in which Forster reprised his \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d character Ed \u201cthe Disappearer,\u201d in the spinoff film that was released on Friday.\n\nForster also held roles in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAmazing Stories\u201d and in \u201cWerewolf\u201d and has acted in more than 100 films.\n\nHORROR ACTOR SID HAIG, OF 'HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES' FAME, DEAD AT 80\n\nForster also had a recurring guest role on the hit Fox family sitcom \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d as Mike Baxter\u2019s widower father, Bud Baxter, who opened a marijuana dispensary in Colorado after legalization.\n\nFollowing news of Forster\u2019s death, his \"Jackie Brown\" co-star Samuel L. Jackson tweet that Forster was \"truly a class act/Actor!!\"\n\nA native of Rochester, New York, Forster quite literally stumbled into acting when, in college intending to be a lawyer, he followed a fellow female student he was trying to talk to into an auditorium where \"Bye Bye Birdie\" auditions were being held. He would be cast in that show, that fellow student would become his wife with whom he had three daughters, and it would start him on a new trajectory as an actor.\n\nA fortuitous role in the 1965 Broadway production \"Mrs. Dally Has a Lover\" put him on the radar of Darryl Zanuck, who signed him to a studio contract. He would soon make his film debut in the 1967 John Huston film \"Reflections in a Golden Eye,\" which starred Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nORIGINAL MOUSEKETEER KAREN PENDLETON DEAT AT 73\n\nForster would go on to star in Haskell Wexler's documentary-style Chicago classic \"Medium Cool\" and the detective television series \"Banyon.\" It was an early high point that he would later say was the beginning of a \"27-year slump.\"\n\nHe worked consistently throughout the 1970s and 1980s in mostly forgettable B-movies \u2014 ultimately appearing in more than 100 films, many out of necessity.\n\n\"I had four kids. I took any job I could get,\" he said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune last year. \"Every time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more. Near the end, I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing. I was taking whatever fell through the cracks.\"\n\nIt was Quentin Tarantino's 1997 film, \"Jackie Brown,\" that put him back on the map. Tarantino created the role of Max Cherry with Forster in mind \u2014 the actor had unsuccessfully auditioned for a part in \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the director promised not to forget him.\n\nIn an interview with Fandor last year, Forster recalled that when presented with the script for \"Jackie Brown,\" he told Tarantino, \"I'm sure they're not going to let you hire me.\"\n\nTarantino replied: \"I hire anybody I want.\"\n\n\"And that's when I realized I was going to get another shot at a career,\" Forster said. \"He gave me a career back and the last 14 years have been fabulous.\"\n\nThe performance opposite Pam Grier became one of the more heartwarming Hollywood comeback stories, earning him his first and only Academy Award nomination. He ultimately lost the golden statuette to Robin Williams, who won for \"Good Will Hunting.\"\n\nLYNYRD SKYNYRD GETS CANDID ABOUT DEPARTED BAND MEMBER, PLANS AFTER FAREWELL TOUR\n\nAfter \"Jackie Brown,\" he worked consistently and at a decidedly higher level than during the \"slump,\" appearing in films like ''The Descendants,\" David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive,\" ''Me, Myself and Irene,\" ''Olympus Has Fallen\" and \"What They Had,\" and in television shows like \"Breaking Bad\" and the \"Twin Peaks\" revival. He said he loved trying out comedy as Tim Allen's father in \"Last Man Standing.\"\n\nHe'll also appear later this year in the Steven Spielberg-produced Apple+ series \"Amazing Stories.\"\n\nEven in his down days, Forster always considered himself lucky.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"You learn to take whatever jobs there are and make the best you can out of whatever you've got. And anyone in any walk of life, if they can figure that out, has a lot better finish than those who cannot stand to take a picture that doesn't pay you as much or isn't as good as the last one,\" he told IndieWire in 2011. \"Attitude is everything.\"\n\nForster is survived by his four children, four grandchildren and Grayson, his partner of 16 years.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Robert Forster, a prolific Oscar-nominated actor, died Friday night in Los Angeles after battling brain cancer, his publicist confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter.
