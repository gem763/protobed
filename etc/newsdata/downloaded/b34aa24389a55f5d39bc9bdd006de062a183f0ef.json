In recent months, the country saw rapid economic deterioration, ballooning debt and rising prices.\n\nOn October 17, the government proposed imposing a tax on Whatsapp calls, along with other austerity measures, sparking nationwide protests that paralyzed the country.\n\nLebanon has been under lock-down since the protests began. Banks and schools have been closed for 12 days, while protesters blocked major routes throughout the tiny eastern Mediterranean nation.\n\n\"I can't hide this from you. I have reached a dead-end,\" Hariri said in his resignation speech.\n\n\"To all my political peers, our responsibility today is how to protect Lebanon and to uplift the economy,\" he added. \"Today, there is a serious opportunity and we should not waste it.\"\n\nScores of protesters in downtown Beirut cheered as Hariri announced his departure. At their peak, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest government corruption on Sunday.\n\nOver the last week, protests have dwindled in number, concentrating on road closures on the country's main routes as the economic crisis has deepened.\n\nChaos in downtown Beirut\n\nPhotos: Lebanon in crisis Supporters of the Lebanese political and militant group Hezbollah clash with police officers in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday, October 29.

Police fired dozens of rounds of tear gas to disperse the crowds.\n\nThe military was deployed to the streets of downtown Beirut on Tuesday, and many anti-government protesters have cleared the site. Earlier, female protesters tried to form a human chain trying to separate the demonstrators from the mobs.\n\nHezbollah's media office could not be reached for comment.\n\nBeirut's main highway (the Ring) covered in tear gas as Hezbollah supporters flee the scene. Confrontations between Hezbollah and security forces are a rare sight in Lebanon, even as they become increasingly frequent since protests began two weeks ago. #Lebanon #\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646_\u064a\u062a\u0646\u0641\u0636 pic.twitter.com/TCx2eHurkd \u2014 Tamara Qiblawi (@tamaraqiblawi) October 29, 2019\n\nCalls had grown in recent days for Hariri and his government to resign. The Prime Minister's cabinet included adversaries such as Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant and political organization.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last week said the protests were part of an international conspiracy aimed at toppling the group.\n\nPolitical vacuum and economic crisis\n\nLebanon is no stranger to political vacuums, having been embroiled in multiple crises over the years that pitted Saudi-backed Hariri against Iran-backed Hezbollah. Hariri's national unity government, first formed in 2016, brought some years of stability as the two foes set aside their differences. But it also presided over a floundering economy.\n\nDecades of government mismanagement and widespread corruption have crippled Lebanon's finances, adding pressure to the currency and causing the debt to swell. The country has one of the world's highest debt to GDP ratios and around a third of the its population lives under the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\nLebanese PM Hariri hands resignation to Lebanon President\n\nHariri's resignation could deepen the latest unrest and exacerbate the economic crisis. But protesters say it also presents an opportunity to shake off the country's sectarian system and transition into civil governance.\n\n\"There's a lot of unknowns. We've moved from a phase of celebration where people were coming together and showing solidarity in one where we don't know whats going to happen,\" said Karim Makdisi, associate professor of international politics at the American University of Beirut. \"There's an official split in the street right now.\"\n\nHezbollah has opposed the government's resignation, with Nasrallah warning that it could lead the country \"into the abyss.\"\n\nThree-time prime minister\n\nHariri has been a major figure in the country's deeply divided political landscape since his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in February 2005. He emerged as a leader of the country's Sunni sect, and became mired in political battles with Hezbollah and its allies. The period was riddled with sporadic violence and stalemates.\n\nIn 2011, Hezbollah's coalition, which consisted of Christian and Shia allies, toppled Hariri's government while he was on a visit to Washington, DC. In 2016, a rapprochement between the two sides led to the formation of the national unity government under Hariri's leadership.\n\nClashes in downtown Beirut on Tuesday\n\nEven if Hariri's resignation marks a possible return to old rifts, it also represents a step forward for Lebanon's protesters.\n\n\"The government's resignation is going to be taken by the protesters as a big victory. i don't think that should be underestimated,\" said Makdisi. \"There is a victory on the one hand, and a possible security issue on the other.\"", "description": "Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced he was resigning on Tuesday, succumbing to the demands of protesters who have staged nationwide demonstrations for nearly two weeks.", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi", "Ben Wedeman", "Ghazi Balkiz"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191018210358-saad-hariri-1018-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
