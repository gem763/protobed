REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nCat-and-mouse clashes spread from the upmarket district of Causeway Bay to the Admiralty area of government offices on Hong Kong island. Violence also escalated across the harbour to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories in the most widespread unrest in nearly four months.\n\nThe South China Morning Post and television reports said at least one person was wounded in the chest by police firing live rounds. Police did not respond to requests for comment but have said they fired live rounds into the air in previous clashes.\n\nVideo footage of a police officer firing at a protester at close range went viral, but there was not immediate verification of its authenticity.\n\nFifteen people were wounded across the territory, one critically, the Hospital Authority said without giving details.\n\nPolice fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices in the Admiralty area and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door.\n\nPolice said \u201crioters\u201d had used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun in the west of the New Territories, \u201cinjuring multiple police officers and reporters\u201d. No details were immediately available.\n\nThe territory has been tense for weeks, with protests often turning violent, as authorities tried to avoid activists spoiling Beijing\u2019s birthday parade at a time when the central government is already grappling with a U.S.-China trade war and a slowing economy.\n\nBy the afternoon, police and protesters were involved in standoffs across Hong Kong, with the streets littered with tear gas canisters and other debris.\n\nNearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the most serious popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.\n\nEarlier, thousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, marched from Causeway Bay toward government headquarters in Admiralty, defying a ban on a rally.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp shut down many of its metro stations to stop protesters moving around. Shutting stations have made them a common target for attack, and a fire was lit at Admiralty station on Tuesday.\n\nProtesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China\u2019s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China\u2019s economic and military progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not young, but if we don\u2019t march now, we\u2019ll never have the chance to speak again, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.\n\nHundreds of officials and members of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-establishment elite began the day with a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, held early and moved behind closed doors. Roads to the centre were closed and tightly policed.\n\nHong Kong had benefited from China\u2019s support under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms after the city\u2019s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nBut he said escalating violence was disrupting social order and hurting the economy.\n\nThe government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already cancelled an annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety.\n\nLam, who was trapped in a stadium for hours last week after attending the \u201copen dialogue\u201d, left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China\u2019s birthday on the mainland. She will return on Tuesday.\n\nCHOREOGRAPHED FESTIVITIES\n\nIn contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nLam was shown on television smiling as a float celebrating Hong Kong went past as she sat with Chinese officials.\n\nThe Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong\u2019s unrest.\n\nRelated Coverage One person in critical condition as HK protests escalate - hospital authority\n\n\u201cOn our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said in a nationally televised speech in Beijing.\n\nHong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial centre.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at pro-democracy protesters throwing petrol bombs in the Asian financial hub on Tuesday as its Chinese rulers celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435842625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902IQ", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
