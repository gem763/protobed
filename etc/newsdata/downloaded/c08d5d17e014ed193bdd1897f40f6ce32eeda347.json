What\u2019s more, Kiplinger\u2019s called out Fort Myers on its list of 50 best places to retire this year, noting that it was \u201cyet another great place to consider for your retirement.\u201d)\n\nSo what makes Fort Myers special? U.S. News writes that the city has \u201cretained its small-town heritage \u2026 with a charming downtown lined with shops and restaurants, many of which are dog-friendly\u201d adding that \u201cmuseums, parades, festivals, theaters, parks, historical sites and art galleries pepper the metro area and its social calendar.\u201d And for those who love the beach, \u201cjust a few miles away, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and Sanibel Island are popular among boaters, kayakers, sailors and anglers.\u201d\n\nPerhaps best of all, it\u2019s pretty affordable, with a cost of living that\u2019s just a bit above average and a median home priced at just a little over $200,000, according to Sperling\u2019s Best Places. Plus, Florida doesn\u2019t have a state income tax, so your 401(k), IRA or pension withdrawals won\u2019t be taxed by the state, nor will your Social Security.\n\nOf course, Fort Meyers has some big downsides, which include muggy, hot summers and the fact that the area can sometimes feel overrun with tourists.\n\nThe towns that rounded out the top five on the U.S. News list were Sarasota, Fla.; Lancaster, Pa.; Asheville, N.C.; and Port St. Lucie, Fla. U.S. News looked at the 125 largest metro areas and graded them on happiness, housing affordability, health-care quality, desirability, retiree taxes and job-market ratings.\n\nShould Fort Meyers not be your thing, and you\u2019re still looking for an affordable spot to retire near the beach, you\u2019re in luck: MarketWatch recently created its own list of the best beach towns where you can retire comfortably on about $40,000 a year.
