Hunter, you're a loser,\" Trump said, his voice rising. \"Your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator -- he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's a--.\"\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s call, Pelosi said: \u201cFor him to say the thing that he said about Joe Biden last night was so far beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nTRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY\n\nShe then turned her attention to the ongoing impeachment inquiry -- and how the \u201cfacts\u201d of that should not stop anyone from making some of Trump\u2019s other behavior into an election issue.\n\n\u201cThat is about elections, and I will make my final point,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts -- \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 -- and the Constitution. His policy, his personality, his potty mouth, that\u2019s about the election, and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons he is \u2013 the inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office. We will honor ours.\u201d\n\nPelosi then called Republicans in the Senate cowardly and said the impeachment inquiry is about saving the Constitution.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ADMITS CLIENT HAD CONTACT WITH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, AS LAWYER'S ANTI-TRUMP BIAS SURFACES\n\n\u201cThe Senate is saying, \u2018Now that you are doing that, we are not doing it.\u2019 You know, just because we have the courage to honor our oath of office doesn\u2019t mean we have to fold to the cowardice of the Senate that is not going to honor theirs,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of this inquiry is to save the Constitution of the United States. The subpoena is the oversight that Congress has as a separation of powers \u2013 political branches of government have checks and balances on each other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before: Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the country. But our Constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s remarks came after the White House outlined in a defiant eight-page letter to the House Speaker and top Democrats on Tuesday why it will not participate in their \u201cillegitimate and unconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry, charging that the proceedings have run roughshod over congressional norms and the president's due-process rights.\n\nTrump administration officials called the letter, which was written by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and obtained by Fox News, perhaps the most historic letter the White House has sent. The document tees up a head-on collision with Democrats in Congress, who have fired off a slew of subpoenas in recent days concerning the president's alleged effort to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden during a July phone call with Ukraine's leader.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi said: \"This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections. ... The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Gregg Re, and John Roberts contributed to this report.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi wants someone to think of the children.", "authors": ["Liam Quinn", "Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News.
