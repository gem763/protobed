It wasn't so much the fact the De Bruyn failed twice, but more the nature of his dismissals that rang alarm bells.\n\nBoth occassions saw Ravichandran Ashwin draw De Bruyn into false shots that turned ugly in a hurry, and he is now under pressure once more.\n\nLogic should see De Bruyn given another crack. He has been identified as a player with abundant Proteas potential for a long time, and with Hashim Amla having stepped away from the set-up, this is the ideal opportunity to give De Bruyn an extended run in the side.\n\nBatting personnel aside, Du Plessis and coach Enoch Nkwe have a lot to think about before naming their 11 for Thursday.\n\nIt's all about finding the right balance, and one of the key questions will be whether to drop a spinner for an extra seamer.\n\nMuthusamy operated as the third spinner in Visakhapatnam, bowling just three overs in India's second innings.\n\nHis role is not clearly defined at this stage, and as one of the commentators on duty in the first Test pointed out, he doesn't bowl enough overs to be considered a specialist bowler and doesn't bat high enough to be a specialist batsman.\n\nMuthusamy, it seems, is a genuine allrounder in India.\n\nIn the early stages of the first Test, it was clear that the seam of Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander was troubling the Indian openers far more than the non-turning spin of Maharaj and Piedt.\n\nFast bowling, for a long time now, has been this side's strength and the temptation to include one of Lungi Ngidi or Anrich Nortje for the second Test - despite conditions - will be very real.\n\nA South African attack with more pace than spin just feels more natural and, crucially, more capable.\n\nGiven the heat and the demands of bowling long spells, Nortje might be given the nod ahead of Ngidi if that is the balance the Proteas look to find.\n\nThe other option for Du Plessis is to bulk up the top order by including Zubayr Hamza as an extra batsman in a move that would see Quinton de Kock drop back down to No 7 and extend the South African line-up.\n\nIn either of those scenarios, though, one of Muthusamy or Piedt will most likely get the chop.\n\nIt would be particularly harsh on Muthusamy, who's composure and resilience was noticeable in the first Test.\n\nWith the absence of any left-handers in the Indian top order, the smart money is on Piedt being considered surplus to requirements given how poorly he performed in Visakhapatnam.\n\nIf Piedt was left out, that would place extra pressure on Muthusamy, who bowled a total of 18 overs in the first Test and just 3 in India's second innings.\n\nBut given what we saw from him on debut, it is already clear that the 25-year-old Durbanite can handle the heat.\n\nPlay on Thursday starts at 06:00 (SA time).\n\nFollow @LloydBurnard on Twitter ...", "description": "Senuran Muthusamy could find himself with added bowling responsibility heading into the second Test against India, writes Lloyd Burnard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7908/f4de31072f864ff7b22ddaf888e9d801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
