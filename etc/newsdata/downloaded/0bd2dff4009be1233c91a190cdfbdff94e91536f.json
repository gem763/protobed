(Image: ILMxLab)\n\nI mean, you also get to wield the Force in VR and that\u2019s pretty cool, but let\u2019s rewind a touch: Four. Armed. Rancor.\n\nAnnounced Wednesday as part of Facebook\u2019s massive Oculus Connect event, the second chapter of ILMxLab\u2019s Vader Immortal VR game series is now available on both the Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift VR headsets.\n\nSet in the years preceding Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Vader Immortal lets players step into the shoes of an unnamed smuggler captaining a ship called the Windfall, which gets captured by Vader\u2019s forces and brought to his mysterious castle on Mustafar. There, it\u2019s revealed you have some secret family connection to an ancient noble named Lady Corvax. One who, it seems, was strong in the Force, given that you find yourself suddenly capable of wielding an ancient lightsaber and using force abilities yourself.\n\nEpisode II of Immortal sees Vader hone those abilities in your character, letting gamers go beyond just the fun lightsaber and exploratory action of the series\u2019 debut and fling rocks around at everything from training droids (and Vader himself in the galaxy\u2019s deadliest game of catch), to the aforementioned four-armed Rancor.\n\nLook, I don\u2019t know what brings you to find a very hostile, four-armed Rancor beneath Vader\u2019s castle. But look at that thing. It\u2019s got four arms. It crawls about like a spider, but it\u2019s a giant bloody Rancor. That\u2019s ridiculous. I love it. And I can\u2019t wait to carve it up in the comfort of virtual reality while Darth Vader... well, presumably does the Sith equivalent of cheering you on, which is leaving you go potentially die at the (four!) hands of an angry giant monster during your Force power 101 class.\n\nVader Immortal Episode II is available now on Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift for $15. As well as the new story content, gamers will get access to a new set of challenge level\u2019s in the game\u2019s \u201cDojo\u201d minigame, which will not just let them practice their lightsaber skills like the first episode, but wield those fancy new Force powers in wave-based combat, too.", "description": "I mean, you also get to wield the Force in VR and that\u2019s pretty cool, but let\u2019s rewind a touch: Four.
