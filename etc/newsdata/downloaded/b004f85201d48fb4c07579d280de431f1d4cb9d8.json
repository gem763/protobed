Little has confessed thus far to strangling 93 women between 1970 and 2005.\n\nCrime analysts at the FBI\u2019s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) confirmed that Little has been matched to 50 cases, with many more cases pending final confirmation.\n\nI thought of Samuel Little as I was reading about the tweets on prison abolition put out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who previously called for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n\u201cMass incarceration is our American reality. It is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage as Jim Crow, American apartheid, & slavery,\u201d the congresswoman tweeted to her many followers \u201cTo end it, we have to change. That means we need to have a real conversation about decarceration & prison abolition in this country.\u201d\n\nDecarceration? \u201cPrison abolition? Really?\n\n\u201cPeople tend to say, \u201cwhat do you do with all the violent people?\u201d as a defense for incarcerating millions,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted later. \u201cA cage is a cage. And humans don\u2019t belong in them.\u201d\n\nWell, yes, Congresswoman. What would we do with Samuel Little and the other violent prisoners, as well as the many thieves and cheats who are thankfully locked up where they can\u2019t victimize more innocent people, if we were to abolish prisons?\n\nIn her tweets the congresswoman did not address the obvious question of what we should do with violent prisoners once she has abolished prisons, other that stating that law makers like herself should come to solutions together.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez also tweeted that she spoke to a woman who was in the New York jail on Rikers Island and the woman told her that the conditions were so bad that she had to drink out of toilets. (I recall the congresswoman also claimed back in July that illegals were told by Customs officials to drink out of toilets).\n\nDespite her comments about Rikers Island\u2019s awful conditions, the congresswoman opposes New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s plan to close the old Rikers jail and build borough-based jails.\n\nThe New York City Planning Commission approved the mayor\u2019s plan to close the jail on Rikers Island and replace it with new and smaller borough-based jails in the four boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Protestors at the meeting called out \u201cNo New jails\u201d and \u201cClose Rikers now.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, the congresswoman urged the city council to vote against the mayor\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be building new jails,\u201d the congresswoman wrote in support of a report by No New Jails, an activist group. \u201cThe No New Jails plan involves reducing the prison population to a level where Rikers Island can be closed and no new jails are necessary.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez stated, \u201cI know the term \u201cprison abolition\u201d is breaking some people\u2019s brains. The right is already freaking out. Yet the US incarcerates more than anywhere in the world. We have more than enough room to close many of our prisons and explore just alternatives to incarceration.\u201d\n\nOf course, the congresswoman does not mention in her tweet any feasible alternative to incarceration for violent offenders and other criminals. Conservatives may not be \u201cfreaking out,\u201d as AOC put it, but many conservatives are shaking their heads in disbelief.\n\nA while back I spoke with Heather Mac Donald, who writes well-researched and thoughtful books and articles for City Journal, rather than the occasional brief tweet like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nHeather Mac Donald, the author of \u201cThe War On Cops: How the New Attack On Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe,\u201d disputed the left\u2019s claim of \u201cmass incarceration,\u201d noting that there is nothing \u201cmass\u201d about the American justice system.\n\n\u201cEveryone in prison was put there one at a time with due process of law,\u201d Heather Mac Donald said.\n\nOver the years that I\u2019ve covered crime, I\u2019ve spoken to a good many crime victims at crime scenes, in police stations and outside of courtrooms. Listening to the horrific stories of crime victims are heart-breaking, especially when the crimes involve children. I\u2019ve encountered battered women and children, grief-stricken family members of homicide victims, and the still-frightened victims of armed robbery.\n\nMost of the victims of murder, rape, armed robbery and scams want the criminals who upset their lives to serve time in prison. The criminal offenders belong in prison not only as punishment for their crimes, but also to protect the public from their brutal and larcenous ways.\n\nSo Rep. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments on prison abolition made me think of Mark Twain.\n\n\u201cSuppose you were an idiot,\u201d Mark Twain said famously in 1891. \u201cAnd suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
