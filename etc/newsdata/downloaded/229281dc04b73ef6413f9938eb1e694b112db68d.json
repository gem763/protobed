It's an ode to the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla that was shot and killed in 2016 after a child fell into its cage. Harambe became meme fodder for a minute after that.\n\nThat minute has come and gone though, so it's interesting that Elon (again, assuming he did this) focused the first song of his SoundCloud rap career on a years-old topic.\n\nAnd, as if that wasn't enough, Elon kept the meme jokes coming on Sunday ... tweeting out a duck emoji -- in reference to a 2018 meme about ranking emojis -- and saying the detail in it far outweighed the clout of Emo G Records.\n\nDuck emoji FTW @elonmusk", "description": "Elon Musk is a SoundCloud rapper now, apparently.
