He would delay Brexit until at least 2020 and even longer if the EU demand it.\"\n\n'Lack of decency'\n\nMr Corbyn was dealt a blow on Saturday when it emerged one of his aides, head of policy Andrew Fisher, revealed he will quit his post by the end of the year.\n\nHe said he wanted \"to spend more time with his young family\", but the Sunday Times claims he warned Mr Corbyn would not win the next general election and criticised the leader's office \"lack of professionalism, competence and human decency\".\n\nMr Corbyn acknowledged Mr Fisher, who helped write the 2017 manifesto, had expressed concerns about the party's direction and he had spoken to him \"at length\" about it.\n\nHe said Mr Fisher was \"extremely distressed\" when he made the comments, suggesting it was the sort of disagreement which happened in many workplaces.\n\n\"He is a great colleague, he is a great friend. We get along absolutely very well. He has promised whatever happens in the future, we will work together on policy issues.\"\n\nAmid continuing fallout from the bid to oust Mr Watson, Mr Corbyn also said he was not told beforehand of Friday's move by left-wingers on Labour's ruling body to abolish the role.\n\nThe party will now consult on replacing the single role with two deputies - one of whom will be a woman.\n\nMr Corbyn, who has been at odds with his deputy over Brexit, said he got on \"absolutely fine\" with him and suggested his intervention had \"put the issue to bed\".", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn's head of policy leaves, as the Labour leader defends the party's policy on Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p0ygp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
