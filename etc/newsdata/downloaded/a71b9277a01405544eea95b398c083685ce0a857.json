Christopher Giannetti\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Marine Corps has finally finished investigating a midair collision off the coast of Japan that killed six Marines in December.\n\nThe collision of an F/A-18D Hornet and KC-130J Super Hercules was caused by an inexperienced fighter pilot who conducted an unusual maneuver, hitting the back end of the tanker aircraft during nighttime refueling operations.\n\nBut there were other issues, as the investigation also called attention to inadequate oversight of training and operations by squadron leadership and an unprofessional command climate within the squadron.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, the commanding officer, the executive officer, the operations officer, and the aviation safety officer were all relieved of their duties.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSix Marines lost their lives in a tragic midair collision last December, and an investigation revealed a series of problems that resulted in the unfortunate incident.\n\nIn the pre-dawn hours on December 6, 2018, an F/A-18 D Hornet collided with a KC-130J Super Hercules aerial refueling tanker, sending both aircraft crashing into the sea.\n\nThe fighter jet was from Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242, or VMFA(AW)-242, and the tanker was with Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 152 (VMGR-152). Both squadrons are part of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, the aviation combat element of III Marine Expeditionary Force.\n\nThe lead fighter refueled and moved into position on the right side of the tanker aircraft. After the second of the two Hornets completed refueling, the pilot, who was unfamiliar with nighttime air-to-air refueling, made an unusual request to move to left side of the tanker, and that is where things went wrong.\n\n\"The investigation indicates the mishap pilot lost situational awareness, unintentionally crossed over the top of the KC-130J from left to right, and collided with the rear of the tanker,\" the Marine Corps said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe six Marines who perished in the collision were Capt. Jahmar F. Resilard, a 28-year-old F/A-18 pilot, and the crew of the KC-130J: Lt. Col. Kevin R. Herrmann, 38, Maj. James M. Brophy, 36, Staff Sgt. Maximo A. Flores, 27, Cpl. Daniel E. Baker, 21, and Cpl. William C. Ross, 21.\n\nRead more: These are the 6 Marines who died when a fighter jet collided with a refueling tanker off the coast of Japan\n\nThe oldest member had served in the Marine Corps for 16 years. Three were married, two with children. Their remains were recovered in June, along with the tanker's cockpit voice recorder and digital flight recorder.\n\nThe Marines concluded that there were no mechanical or technical problems with the aircraft involved in the collision.\n\nThe investigation did, however, identify several problems that contributed to the accident, namely inadequate oversight of training and operations by squadron leadership, an unprofessional command climate within the squadron, and a notable lack of proficiency on the part of the fighter pilot.\n\n\"The information gathered during the investigation led the Commanding General of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to lose trust and confidence in the leadership of VMFA(AW)-242,\" the Corps said in a statement. The commanding officer, the executive officer, the operations officer, and the aviation safety officer were all relieved of their duties.\n\n\"We must all learn from these failures and not repeat them,\" Lt. Gen. H. Stacy Clardy, commander of III Marine Expeditionary Force, said in response to the findings of the investigation.\n\nNOW WATCH: The US Air Force refuels combat jets in midair with a 'flying boom system' \u2014 watch it in action", "description": "The deadly incident led to to a loss of \"trust and confidence\" in a squadron commander and saw the firing of another three Marine Corps officers.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t3c0.WcO9RTWjUWY7cngMw--~B/aD02Njc7dz04ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/5b95cafebd877b46ddd6ba465d0b7c4c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
