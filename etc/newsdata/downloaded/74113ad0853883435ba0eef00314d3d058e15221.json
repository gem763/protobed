The Turkish advance into the northeast is moving slowly, but Turkey\u2019s military options are becoming increasingly limited as the Syrian army, backed by Russia, moves into Kurdish-held cities and towns that might have been targeted by Turkish forces.\n\nIt is unlikely that Mr Erdogan will risk taking on Syrian government troops, even if they are thin on the ground, if this involves quarrelling with Russia. In the seven days since he launched Operation Peace Spring, Turkey has become more diplomatically isolated than Ankara might have envisaged when President Trump appeared to greenlight its attack.\n\nA week later after that implicit OK of Turkey\u2019s offensive, Mr Trump is imposing economic sanctions on Ankara after a wild zig-zag in US policy \u2013 bizarre even by Trumpian standards.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) have avoided costly engagements, but could become more of a threat if backed by Syrian army artillery and tanks.\n\nThis is all very different from 18 months ago when the Turkish army and Arab militiamen invaded the Kurdish-populated zone of Afrin, north of Aleppo, and ethnically cleansed its population.\n\nNone of this was particularly secret and bands of al-Qaeda and Isis-linked Arab gunmen, which were under Turkish control, posted videos of themselves persecuting Kurds and looting their houses and shops. Human rights groups confirmed and publicised the abuses of the Turkish-led occupation forces, but this appeared to have little impact on the wider world.\n\nThe international media was largely focused on similar atrocities being carried out by the Syrian government in besieged Eastern Ghouta in Damascus and had no time for what was happening in Afrin.\n\nThis time round the international media treatment of the present Turkish invasion of northern Syria is very different from the disinterest it showed during Operation Olive Branch in Afrin.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In addition, there is an understandable fear that Mr Trump has given Isis a new lease of life just when it was on the verge of expiring.\n\nSuddenly, there are pictures everywhere of Isis captives fleeing their prisons as their Kurdish guards try to stem the Turkish advance. Mr Trump\u2019s suggestion that Turkey, which only a few years ago had tolerated the great influx of foreign Isis fighters across its borders into the so-called caliphate, would replace the Kurds in suppressing Isis, provoked general derision and dismay.\n\nIn terms of domestic Turkish public opinion, the emphasis is still on Turkish military success, but, from now on, this will bring no political benefits to Mr Erdogan. He must try to operate without allies and is being squeezed by the US and Russia. Turkish troops and their Arab allies are still pushing forward, but Turkey has lost the diplomatic and propaganda wars. In the end, it will have no option but to declare a famous victory and retreat.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s Syrian venture is rapidly turning sour from President Erdogan\u2019s point of view.
