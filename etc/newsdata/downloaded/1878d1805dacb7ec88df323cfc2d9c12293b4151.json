In Hong Kong, the government used broad colonial-era powers to ban protesters from wearing face masks. More than half of US states have passed laws that punish companies or individuals who boycott Israel; according to Human Rights Watch, 78% of Americans live in these states. In Australia, there has been a spike in laws clamping down on protest. In Guinea, dissent has been silenced completely: street protests have in effect been banned for more than a year, with authorities citing threats to public security.\n\nI could go on. All over the world, the right to engage in non-violent protest is under attack \u2013 and not only legally, but from anti-democratic rhetoric. Peter Dutton, Australia\u2019s home affairs minister, said last week that protesters who disrupt traffic should be imprisoned and have welfare payments withdrawn. Dutton, who seems to think he is a feudal lord living in 1419, rather than an elected official operating in 2019, also reckons protestors should be publicly shamed.\n\nGermany also seems keen to suppress democratic protest via public shaming. In May, the Bundestag declared that the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel was antisemitic. An open letter criticising this smear, signed by 60 Jewish and Israeli academics, noted: \u201cThe equation of BDS with antisemitism has been promoted by Israel\u2019s most rightwing government in history [and] is part of persistent efforts to delegitimise any discourse about Palestinian rights.\u201d\n\nBack in Britain, the Telegraph published an editorial on Sunday headlined: \u201cThe right to protest does not extend to acting like a terrorist.\u201d While the piece stopped short of labelling Extinction Rebellion a terrorist organisation, the headline seemed to imply as much. \u201cWe have democratic processes,\u201d the article huffed. \u201cThey should be followed, rather than disrupting the lives of millions.\u201d As if thousands of peoples protesting the destruction of the climate is not the very essence of a democratic process.\n\nWhen you live in a country such as Britain, it is easy to take your civil liberties for granted. It is easy to think that we will never turn into Guinea or Saudi Arabia. It is easy to laugh off a mainstream newspaper implying activists are terrorists, or shrug off the arrests of would-be protesters. But these erosions of free speech and free assembly add up. Our right to rebellion is precious and precarious; if not protected, it will soon become extinct.\n\n\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Pre-emptive police action against protesters is escalating across the world, as illustrated by the arrest last weekend of 10 Extinction Rebellion activists, says Arwa Mahdawi", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e849116a733f629c111d04108a93e0ba914235/0_281_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1081ee7ff74d732f98f00a63933dd027", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
