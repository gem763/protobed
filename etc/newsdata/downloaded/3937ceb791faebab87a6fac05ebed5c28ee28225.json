REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nGreece, the route into Europe for nearly a million refugees and migrants in 2015, is dealing with a new and steep rise in people crossing the Aegean to its islands from neighbouring Turkey after a relative three-year lull.\n\nThe influx has piled pressure on its massively overcrowded migrant camps and prompted the new conservative government to announce a stricter policy to curb the flows, which includes tightening its borders and deporting more people.\n\n\u201cI want to be absolutely clear,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a parliament session. \u201cTurkey... must also assume its responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt has the ability to control the flows in the Aegean. It cannot give the impression that it is exploiting this issue for its own geopolitical pursuits,\u201d he said.\n\nFlows to Greece slowed to a trickle after the European Union and Turkey agreed in 2016 to seal off the Aegean route, before picking up again in August and September to the highest monthly numbers in the three years since the deal.\n\nTurkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, has threatened to \u201copen the gates\u201d unless Ankara receives adequate international support for a plan to resettle 1 million refugees in northern Syria.\n\nIt effectively controls parts of north Syria where it says 350,000 Syrians have returned. Together with the United States it is setting up a \u201csafe zone\u201d in the northeast, where it says many more could be moved.\n\nUnder the 2016 pact, Ankara would take back undocumented migrants and refugees, including Syrians, who cross to Greek islands and do not qualify for asylum. In return, the EU would take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and reward it with more money and other benefits.\n\nMore than 78,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, more than half of them to Greece, according to United Nations data. About 40 percent are families from Afghanistan and about 20 percent Syrian.\n\nMitsotakis said most \u201chave the profile of an economic migrant and not that of a refugee,\u201d and reiterated plans to deport 10,000 rejected asylum seekers by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cThis issue is here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope will constitute a magnet for people from Africa and the Middle East.\u201d", "description": "Greece's prime minister accused Turkey on Friday of appearing to \"exploit\" Europe's migrant crisis for its own ends and said Ankara can and must control migrant flows to the continent.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436986172&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930SG", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
