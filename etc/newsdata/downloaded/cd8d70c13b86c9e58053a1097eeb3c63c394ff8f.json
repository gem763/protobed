We\u2019re going to get past the first round of the playoffs!\u2019\u201d Doolittle recalled. \u201cAnd the new guys that got traded over were like: \u2018What are you guys talking about?! We have a team that can win the World Series. What are we talking about?\u2019 So I know people, D.C. fans, they had to wait a while.\u201d\n\nSo bad for so long, D.C. is suddenly turning into the District of Champions. It\u2019s no Boston, where there have been 11 titles in the past two decades, but things in Washington suddenly are a lot better than they\u2019ve been.\n\nThe Nationals, for example, had never advanced in the playoffs until now, going 0-4 in NL Division Series appearances, including 0-3 in Game 5s at home. Now, though, they are the NL champs. To win the Fall Classic, they need to get past the Houston Astros, who are set to host Game 1 in the best-of-seven series Tuesday night.\n\nStill, just getting this far is a big deal for the denizens of the District, who are not accustomed at all to this level of success.\n\nRemember: For more than a quarter of a century, dating to the Redskins\u2019 Super Bowl championship in January 1992, zero Washington teams won a title in Major League Baseball (which was absent entirely from the banks of the Potomac River from 1969 until the Montreal Expos arrived in 2005), the NFL, NBA or NHL. (Some will note: D.C. United won four MLS Cups from 1996-04.)\n\nIn that span, only once did a Washington representative even make it as far as the conference finals or a league championship series in any of the major four North American professional sports leagues: The Capitals lost in the 1998 Stanley Cup Final (they were swept, naturally).\n\nThat drought of 74 combined seasons without a championship finally was ended by the Capitals in 2018, when Alex Ovechkin and Co. got over their inability to get past the second round and wound up hoisting a trophy and hosting a parade down Constitution Ave.\n\nSo did that change everything for the city?\n\n\u201cWell, I hope so,\u201d said Ovechkin, who threw out a ceremonial first pitch at Nationals Park during these playoffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nHis team\u2019s triumph was followed by the WNBA title won by league MVP Elena Delle Donne and the Washington Mystics this month.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t walk around the city,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said, \u201cwithout people feeling good about themselves right now.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say all is going perfectly in a place better known for politics than championships.\n\nThe Redskins, who won three Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s under Hall of Fame coach Joe Gibbs, are lost: They have won exactly one playoff game in the past 19 seasons, are currently 1-6, recently fired their head coach and tend to have more spectators rooting for opponents than the burgundy-and-gold at home games.\n\nThe Wizards claimed their only NBA trophy in 1978, haven\u2019t been back to the conference finals or won 50 games since 1979, and are coming off a 50-loss season.\n\nU.S. Olympic women\u2019s hockey gold medalist Haley Skarupa grew up in the Washington suburb of Rockville, Maryland, and still lives there. So she\u2019s familiar with the difficulty of growing up a D.C. fan.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of ups and downs,\u201d Skarupa said, \u201cbut emphasis on the downs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe passion around sports in D.C. has always been there, and now that teams are being successful and winning, it\u2019s that much more amplified, which I didn\u2019t even think could\u2019ve really happened,\u201d she said. \u201cTo see it all kind of come together now, it\u2019s very special, and I\u2019m very excited to see what D.C. sports does in the future.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As Sean Doolittle and the rest of the Nationals geared up for Washington's first World Series appearance in 86 years, the lefty reliever thought back to when he first joined the team in a 2017 trade.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/aptopix_nlds_nationals_dodgers_baseball_76281_c0-196-4701-2938_s1200x700.jpg?75749620bf2a83e5680bfcb7bc16f9bcf9bab167", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
