Now, his replacement faces criticism over style.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n this week proposed Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi, currently Hungary's ambassador to the EU, as his pick for the new Commission after the European Parliament rejected his first candidate.\n\nThe Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee blocked L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, a former justice minister, on the grounds that conflicts of interest would have prevented him from carrying out the duties of a commissioner.\n\nEU diplomats as well as current and former Hungarian officials describe V\u00e1rhelyi, a career diplomat and former Commission official, as highly intelligent and extremely knowledgeable on EU issues. But multiple former Hungarian officials also describe an abrasive leadership style that has included screaming, yelling and swearing at staffers. V\u00e1rhelyi also adopts a more combative approach in ambassadors' meetings than colleagues from other countries, according to multiple diplomats.\n\nSuch behavior would not sit easily with the way Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has publicly stated she wants her team to operate. In her mission letters to her nominees, von der Leyen wrote of an \"open, inclusive and cooperative way of working that I will instil throughout the Commission, as well as in our relationships with others.\"\n\nMultiple former Hungarian officials describe V\u00e1rhelyi's abrasive leadership style that has included screaming, yelling and swearing at staffers.\n\n\"I believe that we need to speak and listen more to one another, starting from within the Commission,\" von der Leyen wrote. She stressed that her College of Commissioners should operate as \"one team\" and that there could be \"no room for doubt about our behaviour or our integrity.\"\n\nVon der Leyen has not yet officially designated V\u00e1rhelyi as her nominee to replace Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, who had been in line to take responsibility for EU enlargement and relations with the bloc's neighbors.\n\nHungary's Diplomatic Mission to the EU declined multiple requests for comment for this story. A press officer said that due to the ambassador's \"busy schedule,\" he was unable to respond to questions that set out the allegations from former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe their experiences of working with V\u00e1rhelyi.\n\nOne former Hungarian official said V\u00e1rhelyi \u201cspeaks incredibly rudely with subordinates.\u201d The ex-official described a pattern of behavior that included swearing, yelling, and creating an atmosphere of \u201cemotional terror\u201d for some Hungarian civil servants.\n\nAnother former Hungarian official said that V\u00e1rhelyi has a tendency to scream and swear at staffers in the Hungarian Permanent Representation to the EU, adding that the ambassador \"has an appetite to humiliate them.\"\n\nWhile the working environment at the Hungarian Permanent Representation on Rue de Tr\u00e8ves is \u201cgenerally good,\u201d the former official said, \u201cthe 30 minutes one spends with him [in meetings], depending on his mood swings, can get very nasty.\u201d\n\nA third former Hungarian official said that V\u00e1rhelyi is a \u201cruthless\u201d diplomat who has a reputation for \u201clooking\u201d for conflict, including with Hungarian colleagues, and thriving on it.\n\nA fourth former Hungarian official noted that \"he is not an easy personality.\"\n\nHowever, one current Hungarian official dismissed complaints about V\u00e1rhelyi's treatment of subordinates as \"exaggerated\" and said that the longtime diplomat does not swear at his staffers.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the ambassador is a \"very sharp\" and \"very focused\" diplomat who is highly demanding of his staffers and keeps his aides \u2014 and himself \u2014 under pressure in order to get the best results.\n\n\"It's not simple to prep with him,\" the official said, adding that nevertheless \"we can live\" with V\u00e1rhelyi's management style.\n\n\"I believe that we need to speak and listen more to one another, starting from within the Commission\" \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen\n\nA second current Hungarian official, meanwhile, described his working relationship with V\u00e1rhelyi as \"friendly, cordial and collegial.\"\n\nHigh-flyer\n\nA lawyer by training, V\u00e1rhelyi began his career in the country\u2019s ministry for industry and trade, before joining the foreign affairs ministry in 1996.\n\nV\u00e1rhelyi climbed the ranks at the ministry, working at Hungary\u2019s Mission to the EU ahead of Budapest joining the bloc and later serving as head of the mission's legal service, deputy permanent representative, and ultimately permanent representative in Brussels. He also spent some time working at the European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Internal Market and Services.\n\nAnd while he is known for his in-depth knowledge of EU policy files, V\u00e1rhelyi is far from popular among fellow EU diplomats, showing little appetite for the give-and-take that is common in Brussels meetings.\n\n\u201cHe is extremely smart and sharp, and quite ruthless,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat.\n\nIn ambassadors' meetings \"he treats with arrogance even his colleagues, he\u2019s often condescending,\u201d said another EU diplomat, noting that \u201che talks very badly about the European Parliament and the Commission, even in front of the Commission [officials].\"\n\nDespite being a civil servant, his reputation is that of a loyal proponent of the Hungarian leadership's priorities.\n\nThe ambassador is known in Brussels as a \u201csmart guy\u201d who is \u201cvery close to Orb\u00e1n,\u201d said a third EU diplomat.\n\nThat closeness to the Hungarian prime minister, a controversial figure in Brussels and across Europe due to his championing of \"illiberal democracy,\" is also likely to come under scrutiny if V\u00e1rhelyi gets as far as the confirmation process in the European Parliament.\n\nNeighborly relations\n\nGiven strong criticism from EU institutions over the rule of law in Hungary and Orb\u00e1n's cultivation of relations with Moscow, V\u00e1rhelyi would face the challenge of convincing legislators that he could be a credible judge of democratic standards in the western Balkans and a neutral interlocutor with countries that have difficult ties with Russia.\n\nBudapest insists that complaints about the state of rule of law in Hungary are unjustified and that criticism of its record are driven by liberal politicians who dislike the government\u2019s hard-line anti-migration policies.\n\nV\u00e1rhelyi would face the challenge of convincing legislators that he could be a credible judge of democratic standards in the western Balkans and a neutral interlocutor with countries that have difficult ties with Russia.\n\nIf confirmed as commissioner for neighborhood and enlargement, the ambassador would be in charge of the EU's relationship with the western Balkans, Turkey and the so-called Eastern Partnership countries of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan. His tasks would also include managing relations with southern neighbors, such Libya, Algeria and Tunisia, and working with them toward a partnership on effective migration management.\n\nBut Hungary's government has a troubled relationship with Ukraine partly due to its warm relations with Moscow and because Budapest vetoed meetings of a NATO-Ukraine Commission, to the consternation of the alliance\u2019s other members.\n\nFormally, the veto was due to concerns over a language law that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government argued undermines the rights of Hungarian-speaking minorities in western Ukraine. But critics have suggested that the government in Budapest might be undermining Ukraine's western integration efforts due to Orb\u00e1n's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"The potential selection of V\u00e1rhelyi as enlargement commissioner will amount to the manifestation of Moscow's interests in the region,\" said Attila Ara-Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition Hungarian member of the European Parliament representing the Democratic Coalition.\n\nRelations with western Balkan countries would also not be straightforward.\n\nHungary last year granted political asylum to former Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, an Orb\u00e1n ally who was supposed to start a jail term in his home country for corruption. Orb\u00e1n also spoke out against an EU-backed deal that ended a long-running dispute between Skopje and Athens, resulting in Macedonia changing its name to North Macedonia.\n\nThe decision of businesspeople close to the Orb\u00e1n government to invest in Balkan media assets has also raised eyebrows in the region.\n\nIn her original mission letter to Hungary\u2019s first candidate, Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, von der Leyen asked him to \"work on speeding up structural and institutional reforms, with a strong focus on the fundamentals of the rule of law, economic development and public administration reforms\" in the western Balkans.\n\nDemocracy advocates in the region have questioned whether a candidate linked to Orb\u00e1n's government, which has been accused of eroding the rule of law, is suited for that role.\n\nHowever, some of the EU's neighbors would welcome Hungary taking the neighborhood and enlargement portfolio.\n\nTurkey would not be unhappy. The two countries' leaders get along and have pledged to strengthen bilateral cooperation and trade.\n\nDemocracy advocates in the region have questioned whether a candidate linked to Orb\u00e1n's government, which has been accused of eroding the rule of law, is suited for that role.\n\nAnd some of Orb\u00e1n's allies in the Balkans welcomed the news that a Hungarian would become the enlargement commissioner, taking over from Austria's Johannes Hahn.\n\n\"It is important that this is someone from the region, someone with a balanced approach, someone who is an honest friend of the region,\" Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 said following the Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi nomination.\n\nHis enthusiasm was echoed by nationalist Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who has a close relationship with Budapest. \"I think that it is very important that he comes from Hungary, as they have a sensibility toward the Balkans,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nEven in Brussels, some diplomats believe V\u00e1rhelyi's knowledge of the brief could be an asset.\n\nV\u00e1rhelyi \"has a good understanding of enlargement and neighborhood policy,\" said an EU diplomat.\n\nJacopo Barigazzi contributed reporting.", "description": "Diplomat Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi is widely praised for his intellect \u2014 but not for the way he treats subordinates.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20111207_DISABILITY_190-e1569922263677-1200x628.jpg"}
