Can it rejuvenate momentum on BTC markets or will it be a big overrated flop? We will find out tomorrow.\n\nCountdown to Bakkt Big For Bitcoin?\n\nWith just a day to go, the long-awaited Bakkt physically-settled bitcoin futures trading platform is almost here. Its September 23 launch date has been heralded by many as bullish for BTC as it will enable institutional investors to dabble in the markets.\n\nThe contracts will be paid out in BTC but it is unlikely that investors will want to keep it else they would be buying the asset directly. At the moment it is the extreme volatility that is off-putting for most institutions which thrive on stability.\n\nBitcoin price has been range-bound for the past two months indicating that very little new money has been entering markets. It is the same swing traders buying and selling between themselves that are causing the market chop.\n\nBakkt could change all that if new money starts to enter bitcoin markets. Economist Alex Kr\u00fcger posed the question on volume traded and how the launch will go.\n\n\u201cCME bitcoin futures traded $460 million on its first week. Current volume is around $700 million. The Van Eck fake ETF traded $0 on its first week. How much volume will Bakkt attract is a key variable for the week ahead. Would you expect Bakkt to flop or to launch successfully?\u201d\n\nCME bitcoin futures traded $460 million on its first week. Current volume is around $700 million.

Crypto warlord John McAfee remains bullish adding that it provides a level of trust that institutions have not had before.\n\n\u201cIt is an institutionalized exchange so I won\u2019t be using it, but institutions will feel a level of trust that they had not had. It could jump-start crypto adoption.\u201d\n\nBAKKT goes live tomorrow. It is an institutionalized exchange so I won't be using it, but institutions will feel a level of trust that they had not had. It could jump-start Ctypto adoption. But remember \u2013 it is the opposite of freedom's movement. \u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) September 20, 2019\n\nFundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee echoed the sentiment adding that he is very positive on Bakkt and its ability to improve trust with institutions to crypto.\n\nOthers fear that the institutions will become the new bitcoin whales leading to greater market manipulation. Many industry observers commented that the launch of the CME and CBOE futures in December 2017 led to the big bear market the following year since institutions were able to short BTC for the first time.\n\nEither way, the wait is almost over and a big move lies ahead for bitcoin next week when Bakkt gets off the launch pad.\n\nWill Bakkt boost bitcoin prices or cause it to dump?
