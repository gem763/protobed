Ilhan Omar (D, Minn.) outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) refused on Tuesday to approve a House resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide, and was one of just three congress members to vote \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nThe non-binding resolution passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 405 to 11.\n\n\u201cAccountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as a cudgel in a political fight,\u201d Omar said in a statement explaining her decision. \u201cIt should be done based on academic consensus outside the push and pull of geopolitics.\u201d\n\nOmar further justified her refusal to vote in favor by saying the resolution should have included mention of other genocides and crimes against humanity.\n\n\u201cA true acknowledgement\u2026must include both the heinous genocides of the 20th century, along with earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe resolution states that it will be U.S. policy to recognize the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians at the command of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nTurkey has lobbied vigorously against the resolution, which it views as a distortion of history. The resolution itself does not mention Turkey, referring to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey\u2019s predecessor.\n\nOmar met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in New York City in 2017, while she was a Minnesota state representative.\n\nThe House vote came amid escalating tensions in U.S.-Turkey relations over the handling of Turkey\u2019s invasion of northeast Syria. While President Trump has generally been friendly toward Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, other lawmakers, including prominent Republicans, have pilloried Trump\u2019s decision to allow Turkey to combat Kurdish organizations. Some of those organizations were prominent in the fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cI think some of us are a little bit annoyed with Turkey, and we want them to know how much annoyed we are,\u201d Representative Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.", "description": "The non-binding resolution passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 405 to 11.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
