Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her three children, as allegations that she engaged in an extramarital affair with a Democrat political strategist continue to swirl, according to TMZ.\n\nThe far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member reportedly filed for divorce from husband Ahmed Hirsi on Friday in a Minnesota courthouse.\n\nOmar has claimed that she married Hirsi, who then went by Ahmed Aden, in an Islamic ceremony in 2002, though the couple never married legally. The couple separated in 2008 and later remarried, legally, in 2018. The Minnesota Democrat has faced allegations that she married her alleged brother, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, in 2009. After the two wed, Elmi enrolled at North Dakota State University, according to blogger David Steinberg.\n\nThe New York Post first reported in August that the wife of Washington-based political consultant Tim Mynett filed for divorce from her husband after confessing to her that he was romantically involved with Omar and revealed he was in love with the freshman congresswoman.\n\nIn a September counterclaim, Mynett alleged his estranged wife fabricated the story as part of a \u201cnegative campaign\u201d against him to \u201cseemingly in an effort to ruin his career.\u201d\n\nAllegations of the affair could land Omar in hot water with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which received a formal complaint from a conservative watchdog that accuses the lawmaker of illegally using campaign funds to carry out her alleged romance with Mynett.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nFederal campaign finance records show that Omar\u2019s campaign has paid nearly $230,000 since 2018 to the E. Street Group, a political strategy firm of which the lawmaker\u2019s alleged married lover, Tim Mynett, is a partner of. On Tuesday, Mynett\u2019s wife, Dr. Beth Jordan Mynett, filed for divorce in a D.C.-area court, alleging her spouse confessed to having an affair with Omar in April, the same month FEC documents show that the lawmaker\u2019s campaign began issuing payments to E. Street Group for \u201ctravel expenses.\u201d According to FEC filings, the Minnesota Democrat\u2019s campaign made eight payments totaling $21,547 to E. Street Group for travel costs between April and June. The divorce filings, first reported by the New York Post, also states Tim Mynett made a \u201cshocking declaration of love\u201d for the Minnesota Democrat to his wife and left her soon after. The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), the right-leaning non-profit group behind the complaint against Omar, alleges the timelines of the affair and travel payments overlap. As per FEC guidelines, lawmakers are forbidden from using campaign money for personal travel expenses unless the candidate pays the money back using their personal funds.\n\n\u201cIf Ilhan for Congress reimbursed Mynett\u2019s LLC for travel so that Rep. Omar would have the benefit of Mynett\u2019s romantic companionship, the expenditures must be considered personal in nature,\u201d NLPC\u2019s complaint reads. \u201cRep. Omar\u2019s filings do not reveal subsequent reimbursements for Mynett\u2019s travel.\u201d\n\nOmar has also denied allegations of an affair with Mynett, telling Minnesota media in late August that she had not separated from Hirsi and was not dating anyone else.", "description": "Rep.
