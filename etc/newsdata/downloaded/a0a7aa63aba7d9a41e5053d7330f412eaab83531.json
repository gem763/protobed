There is a lot of this I don\u2019t understand but the system is not completely right,\" he said in a lengthy statement before his death, according to the department. \"It\u2019s not completely wrong but, it is something that has to be done until something better comes along.\"\n\nCrutsinger was sentenced to death by a jury in 2003 after being convicted of the murders of Pearl Magouirk and her 71-year-old daughter, Patricia Syren, earlier that year.\n\nCrutsinger was accused of entering the women's home on April 6, 2003, and stabbing them multiple times and slitting their throats. He then stole Syren's Cadillac and credit card, according to prosecutors.\n\nDetectives later arrested Crutsinger in Galveston, where he had used Syren's credit card in several bars, court documents showed.\n\nCrutsinger confessed to police that he had killed the two women and taken their property. He also told them where they could find evidence, court papers said.\n\nInvestigators found DNA evidence that matched Crutsinger and the victims on a broken knife found in a bathroom in the victims' home, inside Syren's vehicle that was abandoned at a bar and on men's clothing found in a trash bin near the car, court documents said.\n\nCrutsinger was the fifth inmate in Texas and the 14th in the United States to be executed in 2019, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Texas leads the United States in executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "description": "Billy Crutsinger, 64, was declared dead at 6:40 p.m. CDT at the state's death chamber in Huntsville, the Texas Department of Justice said in a statement.
