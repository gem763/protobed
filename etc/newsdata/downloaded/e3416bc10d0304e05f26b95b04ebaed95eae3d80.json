In the classroom were almost 100 students, along with Barry and Maj. Scott Parsons, an assistant professor at West Point.\n\nThe objective was to understand whether AI \u201ccan authentically support teaching in the classroom, where it enhances students\u2019 comprehension and holds interest,\" Barry says.\n\nHow it works: Bina48 is fed a mosaic of general knowledge, in the form of what Barry calls \"mind files.\"\n\nIn preparation for today, AI developers fed Bina48 troves of data about war theory and political philosophy, in addition to Barry's lesson plan.\n\n\u201cWe asked not to hook her on the internet ... because she can easily run to Wikipedia or the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. We want to run her just on the algorithm,\u201d Barry says.\n\nWhen it's Bina48's turn to teach, it peruses its background knowledge and lesson plan and delivers a lecture. And if a student asks a question, the bot can reply out loud.\n\nAfter today\u2019s class, Barry tells Axios the cadets were wholly receptive:\n\n\u201cBefore the class, they thought it might be too gimmicky or be entertainment. \u2026 They were blown away because she was able to answer questions and reply with nuance. The interesting part was that [the cadets] were taking notes.\u201d\n\nBut the bot may not be best suited for West Point, the cadets concluded, since it didn\u2019t quite keep pace with the class. It might make a greater impact in countries with low literacy rates, he says.\n\nFlashback: This is not Bina48's first interaction with West Point students. Last year, it participated in a debate about the use of nonlethal weapons in warfare.", "description": "Two sessions of an introduction to ethics philosophy course.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/rkvBPX2THEYfzPQ5X-x8W1OhmeQ=/0x0:1440x810/1920x1080/2018/10/16/1539666878234.png", "published_at": "2018-10-16"}
