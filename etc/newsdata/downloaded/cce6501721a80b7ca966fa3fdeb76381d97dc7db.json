Several Olympic events, including soccer and baseball, will be held in northeastern Japan.\n\nBut with less than a year to go before the opening ceremony, Yutaka Kumagai, the mayor of Rifu in Miyagi Prefecture, says his city has seen no funding from the central government.\n\n\u201cThere is no help from the government, we don\u2019t have any budget from them, none,\u201d Kumagai said on Saturday. \u201cTokyo 2020 is said to be a symbol of the reconstruction but when it comes to the budget, we don\u2019t have any budget from the Olympic games here in Rifu.\u201d\n\nKumagai made the comments during a media tour of Miyagi Stadium, a 49,000-seat facility in Rifu that will host men\u2019s and women\u2019s football at the 2020 Olympics.\n\nAbout 50,000 people are still displaced in the Tohoku region as of August, according to the Reconstruction Agency.\n\nYoshiaki Suda, the mayor of Onagawa in Miyagi Prefecture, concurred with Kumagai. Like Rifu, Onagawa is a coastal city that sustained heavy destruction.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t received any subsidy, even one yen, from the central government,\u201d Suda said. \u201cWhatever we do for the venues, for the hospitality for the Olympics, we have to do ourselves.\u201d\n\nSome media reports have made the claim that the Olympics have hampered the reconstruction efforts, taking workers away from the region to help with construction in Tokyo.\n\nJapan is one of the most earthquake- and tsunami-prone areas in the world. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 quake offshore caused a tsunami that triggered meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The quake and tsunami heavily damaged coastal neighborhoods in northeastern Japan and took more than 18,000 lives.\n\nTokyo, which projected total costs of about $7.5 billion in its winning bid for the games in 2013, is reportedly spending about $20 billion to prepare the city to host the games.\n\nA group of anti-Olympic activists, many from outside Japan, have held small protests and other events this summer under the Japanese title \u201cHan-gorin no Kai\u201d - which translates roughly to No Olympics. They oppose Olympic spending, which they say cuts into budgets for housing and environmental issues.\n\nThey also call for more money to rebuild Fukushima prefecture located northeast of Tokyo. Organizers say Fukushima is a main focus of the Olympics, staging baseball, softball and soccer games there to persuade the world the area is safe.\n\nTokyo organizers have faced a series of hurdles as they prepare to host the games.\n\nIn August, Tokyo\u2019s summer heat forced an Olympic women\u2019s triathlon qualifying event to be shortened because of high temperatures that are likely to impact next year\u2019s games.\n\nTsunekazu Takeda, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee, was forced to quit earlier this year when he was implicated in a vote-buying scheme to land the games. He has denied wrongdoing, but acknowledged he signed off on about $2 million that French investigators allege went to buy votes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The mayor of a town in northeastern Japan that will host Olympic soccer games says his city has received no funding from the central government that has promised to use the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to help in the reconstruction of the region.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/tokyo_olympics_reconstruction_57572_c0-124-3000-1873_s1770x1032.jpg?7d1beb161f67ffe93c7c95d241569bc02c32d788", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
