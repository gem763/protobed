Until, that is, I see the letters HMRC.\n\nI budget, I save, I switch, and I pay into a pension. I insure my house, my car, my travels and myself. I'm careful with spending.\n\nBut I truly lose the will to live when it comes to dealing with taxes \u2013 it's so much easier when my employer does all that's necessary on my behalf.\n\nThe 'high income child benefit charge' allows working parents to claim hundreds of pounds a year in child benefit payments\n\nMy dread of dealing with the taxman is largely why my husband and I have not yet bothered claiming hundreds of pounds a year in child benefit payments. I'm losing out because I can't be bothered with the paperwork.\n\nTo profit, I'll need to convince my husband to complete a tax return \u2013 which he wouldn't normally need to \u2013 and then repay some of what we've been given in an elaborate cashback arrangement for the taxman. This is known rather drably as the 'high income child benefit charge'.\n\nI'm sure the 'old man' will be less than thrilled at the prospect of complicating our otherwise straightforward financial arrangements.\n\nAt the moment we plod on, paying a high price for a simpler life. Though I do need to embrace child benefit, because it is worth the sum, I'm honestly still trying to muster energy for the task.\n\nSo I have every sympathy for the stay-at-home parents who are not only foregoing cash payments but are unknowingly sacrificing future pension income too.\n\nAt least that's one booby-trap I've managed to side-step as a result of being employed (by a company, rather than my baby-faced boss back at home).\n\nCareer-break parents who aren't paying national insurance contributions can protect their record and safeguard their future retirement income by claiming credits \u2013 but they have to claim child benefit first.\n\nHave you lost state pension by not signing up for child benefits or filling form in wrong? If this has happened to you, contact tanya.jefferies@thisismoney.co.uk and tell us your story.\n\nEven if they know they're not entitled to it, because their partner earns more than the \u00a360,000 threshold.\n\nSound convoluted? More so than the plot of an Agatha Christie novel.\n\nIt's a lot to get your head around when you're looking after children and running a household.\n\nSome couples are putting off throwing themselves into the bureaucratic deep end.\n\nOthers won't yet have realised the consequences of failing to claim a benefit they're not even entitled to.\n\nAnd who could blame them? Let's not forget how the information is first delivered. Straight after a mum delivers a newborn into the world. This is via packs handed out on maternity wards, containing information and money-off vouchers for all the items new parents might need.\n\nThough childbirth presents a rare opportunity for the Government to easily reach its intended audience, it's hardly the most convenient moment for new parents.\n\nI may well have read a pamphlet back in the dark and cold of February 2017, but I don't recollect a word of it if I did. I was a little distracted by my new job of sustaining a tiny, vulnerable human, while dealing with the physical aftermath of producing her.\n\nBy the time parents are out of a 'newborn fog' these leaflets will have been long forgotten. And so starts the path to a poorer retirement.\n\nEvery year that national insurance credits go unclaimed, \u00a3244 a year is knocked off the State pension.\n\nTo get future credit, and a full pension, you have to claim the benefit now. Time to pluck the head from the bucket.\n\nI'd encourage everyone to sign a key petition too. It demands that parents who have lost out from the fiasco to be able to backdate claims longer than three months \u2013 as some will have lost six years by next April.\n\nI don't think it is fair for parents to come undone by this and I fully support those impacted.\n\nPlease join the campaign \u2013 and fight for thousands of mothers who don't even yet know what's being taken away from them.\n\nSign here: petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231761.
