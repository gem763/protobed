I asked if we could put in control measures but they just ignored me.\n\n'They said it was against the rules and that's all they would say on the matter.'\n\nBecause of the letter, Dez decided not to run in the Plymouth 10K over the weekend but took part in a training run the day before.\n\nHe added: 'I have run the half marathon with Elsie three times. After I did the last half I got an email saying if I ran with the pram again I would be banned.\n\n'If they're worried about space I'll start from the back, I've been doing this for years and most people are very receptive.'\n\nBritain's Ocean City Running Series have now threatened to ban him if he does it again\n\nDez said that he started running with his daughter so that he could spend time with his wife, Becky, when she started running.\n\nBut now it's one of Elsie's favourite hobbies and she always asks to go for a run.\n\nDez added: 'It started because my wife wanted to run and I wanted to join her, so we put the little one in the pram.\n\n'She loves it and likes going to the races, she likes hearing the people cheer and getting a medal at the end.\n\n'I don't see the problem with it, it doesn't make any sense to me.'\n\nThe organisers say they have a legal responsibility to 'protect children' and that running with a pram is not allowed.\n\nThe letter reads: 'We have recently been reported that you used a buggy at the Half Marathon, I understand it is a runners one and specially built to accommodate running long distances with your child however this is against UK Athletics rules and regulations.\n\n'I have gone back and checked, I saw that you did ask permission on 8 January 2017 and that you have done it previous years as I assume you had no reply from my predecessor at the time.\n\n'As you did ask permission and you were never informed otherwise when you should have been in previous years we will not ban you from future events, however we insist that you please do not use the buggy again.\n\n'If it is used in any future events, we will have to remove your results and not allow you to run again in any future events.'", "description": "Dez O'Connor, 35, from Plymouth, Devon, likes to run in charity races and for the last three years has been taking his daughter Elsie, three, with him in a specially designed buggy.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19403534-0-image-a-37_1570463443778.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
