Created by the Northern Irish screenwriter and novelist Ronan Bennett, Top Boy starred Walters and fellow actor-musician Kano as warring gang members on the fictional Summerhouse estate in Hackney. Over two series between 2011 and 2013, its uncompromising plot, realistic dialogue and compelling performances won it an army of fans, a Bafta, and constant comparisons to The Wire from broadsheet critics.\n\nFor Walters, it was the kind of role he had been waiting for \u2013 a big part in an ambitious project with the potential to run for years, and an opportunity for stability in a career marked by highs and lows since his breakthrough as Asher D, a member of So Solid Crew (whose single \u201c21 Seconds\u201d was No 1 in August 2001, long enough ago to make this interviewer feel very old).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAt the height of the So Solid era he was jailed for 18 months for carrying a firearm. The ensuing notoriety helped win him parts in Bullet Boy and Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019, but also meant he was typecast as gangsters and became a commentator on gang crime.\n\n\u201cThere was a long period where every time someone was shot or stabbed the BBC would call me. I started to think, \u2018I\u2019m an actor and a musician, I don\u2019t want to be a politician or a spokesperson\u2019.\u201d People are often surprised to learn he\u2019s only 37. \u201cI tell them and they\u2019re like, \u2018Bro, I thought you were 50!\u2019 I think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been watching me for so long. My whole journey has been televised: the negative and the positive.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off \u20ac2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show\u2019s 15 episodes than there are hostages. Netflix 2/20 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u20132018) Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It\u2019s been cancelled now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email. Netflix 3/20 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV \u2013 the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh \u2013 One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran / nurse / single mother \u2013 who suffers from PTSD and depression \u2013 would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process. Netflix 4/20 Private Life (Film, 2018) Based on writer / director Tamara Jenkins\u2019s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie\u2019s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It\u2019s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised. Netflix 5/20 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep dive into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show\u2019s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly \u2013 and seemingly disastrously \u2013 changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones; Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig\u2019s wonderful turn as a talking vagina. Netflix 6/20 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016\u2013) Joe Swanberg\u2019s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you\u2019ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams \u2013 who you might remember from Todd Solondz\u2019s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness \u2013 is the show\u2019s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul. Netflix 7/20 Love (TV series, three seasons, 2016\u20132018) Community\u2019s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely \u2013 and arguably deeply unwise \u2013 relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus\u2019s pathological need to be the nice guy, we\u2019re never quite sure who or what we\u2019re rooting for \u2013 which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing. Netflix 8/20 Patton Oswalt: Annihilation (stand-up special, 2017) In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cstand-up special\u201d, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone. Netflix 9/20 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Granted, this horror-comedy \u2013 which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh \u2013 is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it\u2019s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila\u2019s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair\u2019s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn\u2019t quite like anything else on TV right now. Netflix 10/20 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is \u2013 in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he\u2019s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier\u2019s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world\u2019s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier\u2019s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims. Netflix 11/20 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) Based on Vikram Chandra\u2019s epic 2006 novel, Netflix\u2019s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games \u2013 which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster \u2013 only covered one quarter of Chandra\u2019s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d. Netflix 12/20 Dumplin\u2019 (Film, 2018) When the trailer for Dumplin\u2019 first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin\u2019 such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described \u201cfat girl\u201d who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin\u2019 is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist \u2013 and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot. Netflix 13/20 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) This sci-fi thriller \u2013 which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties \u2013 has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things. Netflix 14/20 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017) Though it\u2019s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015\u2019s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992. Netflix 15/20 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 \u2013 meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward\u2019s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life. John O Flexor/Netflix 16/20 Set It Up (Film, 2018) Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term \u201cover-dicking\u201d (it\u2019s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre. Netflix 17/20 Cargo (Film, 2017) Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable spanners in the works. Netflix 18/20 3% (TV series, two season, 2016\u2013) Like a cross between The Hunger Games and CW series The 100, this Brazilian dystopian thriller, set in an unspecified future, revolves largely around an impoverished community known as the Inland. Every year, each 20-year-old takes part in a series of tests; the highest scoring 3% will be chosen to live in paradise in the Offshore. It is an intriguing and addictive commentary on class and privilege. Netflix 19/20 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) With shades of John Ford's The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it's about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws\u2019 pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special.

Netflix\n\nIn person, Walters is thoughtful and reserved, dressed in all black. He has two main modes of sitting: one with his arms folded, elbows on knees, leaning forward, gym-enlarged biceps prominent; and another, slightly more upright, arms slightly more open. He has a ready grin but is not a lean-back-and-bellow-with-laughter kind of a subject, which is not to say that he\u2019s an ungracious interviewee. He answers everything at length and with articulate good humour. It\u2019s more that you sense it\u2019s a version of openness, but there are parts he doesn\u2019t want to show, perhaps to anyone. He confirms something I\u2019ve read elsewhere, that he doesn\u2019t have any friends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t, really. People don\u2019t come to my house. I don\u2019t have friends come over and have dinner or a mate with a wife who\u2019s friends with my wife or whatever. I don\u2019t have that sort of lifestyle. There\u2019s no one I can call and be like, \u2018I\u2019m coming round, let\u2019s play some Fifa.\u2019 Most are working relationships. When it comes to friends, as in people to relax with, that\u2019s my wife and my kids.\n\n\u201cI think part of it is that I don\u2019t really like people. I get a bit, \u2018Can I go home now?\u2019 Like, we\u2019ve got the premiere tonight and I\u2019m looking forward to it but once I\u2019m there I\u2019ll be trying to find an excuse to go home. I get distracted. I start to think \u2018What are they wearing, why haven\u2019t I got those trainers?\u2019 The whole networking thing, having to talk to people when you haven\u2019t got anything to say. It\u2019s not my bag.\u201d\n\nHis frankness can be startling. As an actor, he\u2019s able to shift from gravitas to menace without sacrificing a sense of underlying vulnerability. In Top Boy he had a part with enough depth for him to show what he can do, part of the reason the cancellation stung so much. \u201cTo this day, I\u2019ve never had an answer from anyone,\u201d he says.\n\nA mythology has already built up around the circumstances of the programme\u2019s revival. Drake, the superstar musician who was already a champion of British artists like Skepta, stumbled across the series on YouTube and loved it. For Walters, who had been going door to door to producers trying to get the programme recommissioned, what happened next was miraculous. The TV gods move in mysterious ways, and sometimes take the form of Canadian rappers sliding into your DMs.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Walters says. \u201cI woke up one morning and I was all over his Instagram. He messaged me to say he was a fan and asked what was going on with the show. I said it was done. He said, \u2018We\u2019ll see about that\u2019. Drake put in a few calls. Soon Netflix bought the rights to the original two series, and commissioned a third. Depending on how this one goes down, more could follow. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the start of the new series, Walters\u2019s character, Dushane, is in Jamaica, hiding from his past sins in Hackney. Circumstances soon force him back to London, where there is a new top boy in the form of Jamie (Micheal Ward). The new cast also includes the rappers Dave and Little Simz. London has changed since Dushane was last there. In one early scene, he is confounded by a hipster coffee shop on Broadway Market, an evolution Walters can relate to, having grown up in lately gentrified Peckham.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up we called Peckham Little Lagos,\u201d he says. \u201cThen last month I was doing a gig there in this old bakery. I hadn\u2019t been back for a while and I was prepared for it to be quite a hostile atmosphere. Then I got there and there were three black people there. I felt like I was in Truman\u2019s Brewery [an east London venue that, it\u2019s fair to say, will rarely have been described as Little Lagos]. It was relaxed and comfortable, but a very white crowd.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, Top Boy is one of the most cold-eyed appraisals of contemporary London on television. Property developers hover like carrion birds. Turkish drug-dealers discuss the effects of Brexit. Home Office officials turn up unannounced to threaten single mothers with deportation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s political, but it\u2019s not in-your-face about it,\u201d Walters says. \u201cBut you see the camera pan from Summerhouse to the City with the banks and the penthouses. There\u2019s a lot of animosity created in that gap. People are pushed out from their communities which creates tension elsewhere. In south London, kids from Brixton and Peckham were pushed into Croydon, which eventually gave Croydon the highest knife crime rate. It\u2019s important these things are part of the show. Everyone talks about knife crime like we don\u2019t know where it comes from. Sometimes I watch Question Time and just want to turn it off. Most of these kids feel disenfranchised. They\u2019re angry, and as far as they\u2019re concerned they are not part of society. The backdrop of racism is still there, too. I hope Boris watches Top Boy.\u201d\n\nWhile he might not want to be a spokesperson, Walters knows that his example could be helpful. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m a role model because I\u2019ve not been the most clean-cut person, and there were times I could have gone the other way. But I\u2019m still here, doing what I\u2019m doing, and for other black kids that can be an amazing thing, because I didn\u2019t have too many of those people to look up to coming through.\u201d\n\nThe example starts at home. Walters has eight children, four sons and four daughters, two with his wife, Danielle, and the others from previous relationships. \u201cPeople will say I\u2019m sexist, but girls have been easier for me, especially in education,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re more willing to learn. My eldest son is nearly 20. At 17 I had left home and had him, so the fact he\u2019s not got a job and is doing this and that angers me sometimes. I think, \u2018Are you not scared about your future?\u2019 because I was, but then maybe that\u2019s because I had to be and he doesn\u2019t have to be. At the moment there\u2019s part of him that wants to be more street and hard like his friends, but the fact is, he\u2019s had a better life than them. There\u2019s no reason for him to sell drugs or be knocking around on the street or stupid s*** like that. So any time he tries to get involved, I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re ridiculous \u2013 do you want me to tell your friends actually how your life is?\u2019\u201d There are layers of irony: a son wanting to be more like Top Boy despite the cushioning privilege afforded by his dad, famous from starring in Top Boy.\n\nThere\u2019s another series of his detective buddy show Bulletproof on the way but, apart from that, Top Boy has him signed up for as long as Netflix wants. Walters doesn\u2019t seem worried by the prospect.\n\n\u201cWork has saved me,\u201d he says. \u201cWork and my kids. If it wasn\u2019t work, it would have been something else. I\u2019ve always been completely focused on climbing. I\u2019ve never wanted to feel comfortable or secure because that\u2019s when you get taken out, or start to let go. But the unfortunate thing is that you don\u2019t stop to congratulate yourself.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s quick to congratulate others, though. \u201cI\u2019ve had really good influences and people in my life. My dad wasn\u2019t there, and financially unstable, but my mum was just so solid\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve rehearsed that one,\u201d I protest.\n\n\u201cNah, it just came to me. But I thought I\u2019d go with it.\u201d\n\nTop Boy is available on Netflix now", "description": "I was devastated,\u201d says Ashley Walters, remembering the day in 2014 that Channel 4 cancelled Top Boy, the gang crime drama that has been revived by Netflix. \u201cIt was a hard thing for me to deal with.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Cumming"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/14/ashley-walters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
