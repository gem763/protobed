And while she\u2019ll finally get her own standalone film, the 2020 prequel Black Widow, Johansson has professed overwhelming sadness over Natasha's demise. Still, the 34-year-old actress is publicly fighting the good fight for an all-female MCU adventure, with or without her.\n\n\"I think it's something that audiences want, I certainly want [it],\" she said. \"It's more opaque for me, obviously, because of my character's fate. But I'm 100 percent all for it, I think it would be fantastic.\"\n\nAs evidence, Johansson pointed to the memorable sequence in Endgame where several of the MCU's heroines, including Captain Marvel (Larson), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), form a united front on the battlefield.\n\n\"[It] was such a huge moment for the audience,\" she said. \"It was just like, 'Yes, make this a film.'\"\n\nJojo Rabbit opens Friday.
