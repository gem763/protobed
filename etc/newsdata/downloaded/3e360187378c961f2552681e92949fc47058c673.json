But oh so slooooow...", "language": "en", "text": "The Dublin Murders\n\nMonday, Tuesday BBC1\n\nRating:\n\nCharlotte Church\n\nThursday, Channel 4\n\nRating:\n\nor\n\nRating:\n\n(Too baffling to know for sure)\n\nThe Dublin Murders is adapted by Sarah Phelps from the books by Tana French. Phelps\u2019 modern, rich, dark adaptations of Agatha Christie for TV have become a Christmas treat, and maybe she\u2019ll one day put her mind to a #Wagatha Christie, as who wouldn\u2019t want to see Coleen Rooney, the world\u2019s greatest detective, point her finger at Rebekah Vardy while declaring: \u2018It was you.\u2019 I am hoping Rooney will have a little moustache (oh, please) and it will be set either in a train carriage or a mountain top hotel cut off by snow. But that is not the business in hand, alas, so back to The Dublin Murders, which is rich and dark, certainly. It may even be too rich and dark, as it did feel like swimming uphill though treacle. A slog, in other words, and also so slooooooooooow. Plus, it\u2019s yet another dead girl as found in the woods, innit.\n\nRob Reilly (Killian Scott) and Cassie Maddox (Sarah Greene) in The Dublin Murders. It\u2019s too bittily busy to be immersive or propulsive\n\nHere, two Garda detectives, Rob Reilly (Killian Scott) and Cassie Maddox (Sarah Greene), are put to work investigating the murder of the aforementioned dead girl found in the local woods. She was 13 and a promising ballet dancer, but mostly everyone is wondering if it links to events of 20 years earlier, when three kids went into the woods and two disappeared, never to be seen again, while one emerged with slashed clothes and shoes filled with blood but no memory of what happened. This is all shown in flashback. I don\u2019t wish to give too much away, so for now I\u2019ll say that both the first two episodes (of eight) ended with a twist about identity. In short: both Rob and Cassie have secrets too.\n\nIt is busy, flitting between the now and the then, but also strangely inert, with no mounting drama or tension. It may be too bitty. A bit here, a bit there. Who\u2019s the fella in the donkey jacket? Who\u2019s the businessman who hates him? Who\u2019s prowling Cassie\u2019s flat at night? What\u2019s the cleaner at the ballet school hiding? Why are the dead girl\u2019s family so weird?\n\nIt felt like swimming uphill through treacle \u2013 plus it\u2019s yet another dead girl in the woods\n\nIt\u2019s too bittily busy to be immersive or propulsive. Although this isn\u2019t to say the performances aren\u2019t good, as they are \u2013 I could watch Sarah Greene forever and never get bored \u2013 and Rob and Cassie\u2019s friendship is also well drawn, particularly in one of the first scenes, when he holds her by the belt loop. That was charming, but mostly this is bleakly charmless, with a bleakly charmless soundscape: the drumming of rain, the creaking of trees, the snap of crime-scene tape. I was always longing for Rob and Cassie\u2019s boss to make an appearance because, even though he\u2019s a sexist pig, he did lighten the mood. This may be one of those series where I\u2019ll skip it from now on and just watch the final episode to get an idea of how it all turns out. I did that with Big Little Lies and it was fine.\n\nThere are some reality TV shows that make perfect sense. For instance, Caravanning With Shane Richie (Channel 5) makes perfect sense as he gets to take his extended family on holiday for nothing, probably, although he does have to work hard in return, dispensing invaluable tips. I particularly enjoyed his advice about arriving at a caravan park \u2013 \u2018Check in is usually after 3pm\u2019 \u2013 and his advice on what you should take. Toilet roll, for example, is \u2018a must\u2019.\n\nBut Charlotte Church: My Family And Me? Plain baffling.\n\nThe singer has complained, rightly and loudly, down the years about media intrusion into her privacy, and yet here she was, disappearing to Devon for five days with her parents and the TV cameras, to see if they could\u2026 I\u2019m not sure exactly. But whatever it was, why on camera? Why?\n\nIt was painful. Her mother, Maria, has mental health issues, while her beloved stepfather, James, revealed he has a terminal illness and only months to live. My God. There were hugs and tears and recriminations. Maria had been Charlotte\u2019s manager until Charlotte walked out on her at 16 and then didn\u2019t talk to her for 18 months.\n\nCharlotte Church: My Family And Me? was painful. Her mother, Maria, has mental health issues, while her beloved stepfather, James, revealed he has a terminal illness\n\n\u2018You actually stepped over me, Charlotte,\u2019 said Maria. \u2018I was on the floor begging you and you stepped over me.\u2019\n\n\u2018I dealt with it awfully,\u2019 accepted Charlotte but, having been a child star, you could see she also needed to be free. It was often moving. Indeed, when James said to Charlotte, at one point: \u2018You are so beautiful and I\u2019m so proud of you\u2019, and she said to him: \u2018The gift you have given me more than anything else is kindness\u2026 you have been so kind all my life\u2019 I burst into tears myself. But I did not feel at all comfortable doing so.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine any of them needed the money, or a free holiday in Devon that was the opposite of swish (compost toilet, outdoor shower). So why would she invade her own privacy like this? Deeply baffling, like I said.", "description": "It is busy, flitting between the now and the then, but also strangely inert, with no mounting drama or tension. It may be too bitty.
