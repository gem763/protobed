This is the environment Ms. Lavi expected to encounter last spring during a guest lecture by Professor Rabab Abdulhadi purportedly addressing Islamophobia. To her surprise and shock, however, she was confronted with a diatribe that attacked a core component of her identity as a Jewish Zionist, i.e.,one who supports the right of the Jewish people to self-determination in their ancestral homeland\u2014Israel. Worse yet, the speaker accused Zionists of a willingness to engage in ethnic cleansing to achieve the goal of a Jewish state and expressly characterized this integral part of Ms. Lavi\u2019s Jewish identity and ancestry as a form of white supremacy.\n\nAfter Adulhadi made these remarks, Lavi attempted to defend herself. Instead, Adulhadi allegedly interrupted and told Lavi that her Jewish identity was \u201cwrong.\u201d Moreover, Lavi\u2019s professor, who had invited Adulhadi to speak on campus, refused to defend Lavi during the exchange.\n\nWhen Ms. Lavi exhibited the courage to challenge these statements, she found no allowance for open debate; instead, the speaker told Ms. Lavi in no uncertain terms that Zionism, this fundamental piece of Ms. Lavi\u2019s Jewish identity,was \u201cwrong.\u201dRather than come to Ms. Lavi\u2019s aide, the professor for the class, Dr. Kyeyoung Park (who was responsible for inviting a speaker who used antisemitic rhetoric in her classroom) further aggravated Ms. Lavi\u2019s embarrassment in front of the entire class by remaining silent. Dr. Park then added insult to injury by subjectingMs. Lavi to continual harassment on the subject of Zionism in subsequent class meetings and noted her own agreement with the speaker\u2019s antisemitic rant. These experiences, unsurprisingly, left Ms. Lavi feeling marginalized, estranged and unwelcome as a Jewish student\u2014both in Dr. Park\u2019s class and as a student at UCLA in general.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that students have complained about antisemitism at UCLA. Breitbart News reported in January 2018 that the office of then-UCLA student body president Arielle Mokhtarzadeh had been defaced with antisemitic vandalism. A vandal intentionally destroyed Mokhtarzadeh\u2019s Mezuzah, a Jewish ornament that is traditionally placed outside of a doorway.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for updates on this story.", "description": "A student at UCLA has filed a complaint with the Department of Education alleging that her university supports antisemitism.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/BDS-boycott-Israel-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
