(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Born after the historic July 1 day when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the 18-year-old protester who was shot at close range in the chest by a police officer during violent demonstrations this week and then arrested in the hospital is part of a generation for whom the clock is ticking.\n\nIn the lifetimes of young Hong Kong citizens born after 1997, the sands will run out on China\u2019s promise _ enshrined in the territory\u2019s constitution _ that Hong Kong\u2019s \u201ccapitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.\u201d\n\nThat looming deadline and uncertainty about what, exactly, will happen after 2047 weigh like a sword of Damocles in the minds of many people in Hong Kong.\n\nBut protesters who have flooded the streets since June are certain about what they don\u2019t want: For Hong Kong to become like all of China\u2019s other cities, its special freedoms snuffed out, its status lost as a freewheeling international hub for business and ideas.\n\nThose fears, his schoolmates say, drove Tsang Chi-kin to become a protest leader in his high school, which bubbled with fury Wednesday following the teenager\u2019s shooting during widespread and violent demonstrations that wracked Hong Kong on Tuesday, as Communist leaders in Beijing were celebrating 70 years in power.\n\nAs other pupils at the Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College in Hong Kong\u2019s Tsuen Wan district used their lunchbreak to chant in anger, a 17-year-old student who previously joined Tsang on marches said he and others born after 1997 feel that if they don\u2019t fight now to defend the territory\u2019s liberties, they may never get a second chance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, Kin is so passionate,\u201d said the schoolmate. Like many who fear they could face repercussions for protesting, he would only give a single name, Sam. \u201cHe believes that this is the last time, the last chance for us to fight for what we have.\u201d\n\nBut while friends used the word \u201cbrave\u201d to describe their wounded schoolmate, the police chief defended the officer's use of force as \"reasonable and lawful.\" Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said the officer had feared for his life and made \"a split-second\" decision to fire a single shot at close range. Video of the shooting showed the protester striking the officer\u2019s shooting arm with a metal rod, and that he was part of a group of about a dozen black-clad and masked demonstrators who swarmed the officer and other riot police, some hurling objects.\n\nPolice said Thursday that Tsang would be charged with rioting and two counts of \u201cattacking police.\u201d Rioting carries a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe shooting _ the first time a protester is known to have been hit by gunfire _ was a fearsome escalation in what is already the most serious crisis faced by any post-1997 Hong Kong leader and is severely testing the strength of Beijing\u2019s commitments to let the territory be largely its own boss, at least until 2047.\n\nFor schoolmates of Tsang, the injured protester, those promises are becoming ever-harder to believe. Exhibit A for sceptics was a Hong Kong government proposal that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts. Although its withdrawal was promised in September, the bill blew away trust that Hong Kong won\u2019t slowly lose its freedoms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a small town in China. That\u2019s why we need to stand out,\u201d said Sam, who recalled riding the bus with Tsang to march in central Hong Kong, where protesters have repeatedly targeted government and police headquarters and been repelled by tear gas, water cannons and arrests.\n\nHe said Tsang, as a protest regular, advised others about how and where to demonstrate and gave \u201cabsolutely everything for this movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a good leader,\u201d he said.\n\nA female classmate, tears welling in her eyes, said, \u201cJust last Friday, we were sitting next to each other and chatting and now he\u2019s been shot and in critical condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe heard police say they may want to press charges against him. It\u2019s preposterous,\u201d said the 16-year-old, who gave only her initials, SY. \u201cPolice fired the shot but they want to charge him. Instead of being a victim, he\u2019s been made the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nSeeing youngsters organize, march and be swept up by riot police has infuriated many older Hong Kong residents and swung them behind the movement.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Born after the historic July 1 day when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the 18-year-old protester who was shot at close range in the chest by a police officer during violent demonstrations this week and then arrested in the hospital is part of a generation for whom the clock is ticking", "authors": ["John Leicester", "Eileen Ng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/amhSY1aLDyHY8Wa6VxiMkw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/7feb60831dd557e94045bac2688dc64f", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
