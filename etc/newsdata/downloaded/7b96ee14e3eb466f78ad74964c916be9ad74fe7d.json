Biden on Monday accused President Trump of screwing up America\u2019s anti-terror strategy and nearly botching the military strike that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nMr. Biden, a top candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic behavior\u201d jeopardized U.S. special forces conducting the al-Baghdadi raid in Syria over the weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad President Trump ordered the mission. But as more details of the raid emerge, it\u2019s clear that this victory was not due to Donald Trump\u2019s leadership. It happened despite his ineptitude as Commander-in-Chief,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement.\n\nHe blamed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out about 150 U.S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border earlier this month with complicating the mission, accelerating and compressing the timeline for the raid.\n\nMr. Trump announced Sunday that the raid succeeded in killing al-Baghdadi, a brutal and ruthless leader of the Islamic State terrorist army whom the president had made the top target in America\u2019s war on terror.\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Mr. Trump said of al-Baghdadi\u2019s final moments before detonating his suicide vest to avoid capture. \u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s immediate response to the announcement was to credit the U.S. military and the intelligence community for the win, avoiding mentioning Mr. Trump\u2019s role in ordering the mission.\n\nHe said Mr. Trump\u2019s pullout from the Turkey-Syria border had abandoned Kurdish fighters there, who have come under attack from Turkey, and wrecked that important alliance for confronting the Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\nThe former vice president said the pullout, which Mr. Trump described as an effort to bring U.S. troops home, made it harder to fight ISIS in the future.\n\nMr. Biden said Mr. Trump lacked a strategy for fighting terrorism and keeping America safe.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between deploying hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to the Middle East indefinitely, and keeping small numbers of special operations and intelligence assets in place to maintain local partnerships and keep pressure on terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the smart, strong, and sustainable strategy we pioneered during the Obama-Biden Administration. That\u2019s the effective policy we put in place, which laid the groundwork to end ISIS\u2019s territorial caliphate. That\u2019s the way we built the very relationships that ultimately delivered this victory.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNow, Trump wants to tear it all down and walk away.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State grew into a major terrorist organization and seized territory the size of Ohio following the Obama administration\u2019s military pullout from Iraq in 2011.\n\nThe Trump administration succeeded in retaking ISIS territory in Iraq and Syria, which the group called a caliphate.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
