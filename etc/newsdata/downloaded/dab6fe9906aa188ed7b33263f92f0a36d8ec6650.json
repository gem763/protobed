But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. \u201cIt was unconventional what I did,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,\u201d he added. \u201cThen you pull them apart.\u201d\n\nWhile he has previously denied giving Turkey the green light to attack the Kurds, Mr. Trump implied on Thursday night that actually he had done so in order to persuade the two sides to come to terms. \u201cWithout a little tough love, they would never have made this deal,\u201d he said.", "description": "Hours after his vice president and secretary of state brokered a cease-fire, President Trump said he was right to let Turkey attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies because it eventually led to a deal.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/us/politics/17dc-trump/17dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
