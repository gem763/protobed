I wouldn't even let a stray dog sleep in the room. It smelt of cat pee and there was mould everywhere and holes in the wall.\n\n\"There was exposed electrical wiring and a loose cable on the floor which could be really dangerous for my little ones.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"The mattress was filthy with stains all over it.\n\n\"The curtains were hanging off the poles and dirty glasses and plates had been left in the room and the air conditioning didn't work.\n\n\"Outside our room there were dirty cloths which looked as though they had been used for cleaning and mopping floors and then just dumped.\"\n\nVicki and her family, Danny, 2, Teddy 10, Terry, 14, Jamie, 19 and mum, Lydia, 75, were left devastated.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"My eldest son just wanted to go home and my boy who has autism had a meltdown. He can't cope with change and so we have to prepare him for change.\n\n\"I had spent three months showing him the hotel we were going to stay at, the room he would be in and so he was expecting what he saw in the brochure.\n\n\"When it wasn't that he was very upset and it was extremely stressful for him. It has been a complete nightmare.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nSaid Vicki: \"We looked at the pictures of the hotel on their website and it looked a lovely hotel. There was nice stuff for the kids to do and the reviews were all good so we went ahead and booked it.\n\n\"We've been told by other Brits staying at the Didim Beach Resort that they were moved the day before because they've shut the hotel because there's not enough people staying there.\n\n\"Everybody has been moved to a smaller hotel.\n\n\"When we asked management we were told they advised Onthebeach that the hotel was closing and we should have been sent an email telling us but Onthebeach say this isn't true.\n\n(Image: onthebeach.co.uk)\n\n\"We feel robbed. We didn't pay to stay in this hotel. It's an absolute, disgrace. It was meant to be a birthday treat for me and this has been ruined.\n\n\"My boyfriend, Danny, was looking forward to recharging his batteries but we've had nothing but stress and my mum, who has COPD, had a panic attack because of how hot her room was. The whole family are upset.\n\n\"Onthebeach have sold us a holiday and then gone and stuck us in a dive.\"\n\nA picture of sister hotel Didim Beach Resort Aqua and Elegance was posted to the official instagram account for Didim Beach Resort yesterday with the caption: \"We continue the season at our Elegance Hotel.\"\n\nVicki and partner Danny, spent hours trying to get and answer from OTB and were eventually told they were being moved to a new hotel but they still encountered further problems when they turned up.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"We were told by OTB that we were 'good to go' and giving a booking reference but when we turned up at the new hotel the manager knew nothing about it. Luckily, he was amazing and said we could stay the night as a guest of the hotel and he would sort things out in the morning. We were so lucky.\"\n\nOnthebeach.co.uk have been contacted for comment.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Things went from bad to worse for Vicki Grant and her family when they were then moved to a replacement hotel which was \"absolutely disgusting\"", "authors": ["Andy Rudd", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Mirrorpix", "Onthebeach.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589681.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Family-Holiday.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
