Fighting surged this year during ongoing talks between the US and the Taliban about a political solution for the conflict.\n\nAccording to analysts, both sides tried to gain leverage during negotiations through military gains. The talks were called off by US President Donald Trump in early September after an American soldier was killed in a Taliban attack.\n\nHowever, there are signs the talks might resume. US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in the Afghan capital on Saturday and met Afghan officials, including President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nThe visit was Khalilzad's first to Afghanistan since the talks with the Taliban were cancelled.", "description": "Mass displacement takes place as Afghan forces continue to battle Taliban and ISIL fighters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/cebc6510dd7d42fd97a52ea131e3ffb3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
