One of his most senior ministers said Britain would still leave the bloc on Oct. 31.\n\n\"We are going to leave by October 31. We have the means and the ability to do so,\" Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, told Sky News.\n\n\"That letter was sent because parliament required it to be sent ... but parliament can't change the prime minister's mind, parliament can't change the government's policy or determination.\"\n\nIn an extraordinary step that indicates the extent of the Brexit fever gripping the United Kingdom, Johnson sent three letters to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council.\n\nFirst, a brief cover note from Britain's EU envoy explaining that the government was simply complying with the law; second, an unsigned photocopy of the text that the law, known as the Benn Act, forced him to write; and a third letter in which Johnson said he did not want an extension.\n\n\"I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the Government's position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,\" Johnson said in the third letter, signed \"Boris Johnson\".\n\nThe EU, which has grappled with more than three years of tortuous Brexit crisis, was clearly bewildered by the contradictory signals from London.\n\nTusk said he had received the request from Johnson.\n\n\"I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Johnson that Paris needed swift clarification on the situation after Saturday's vote, an official at the French presidency told Reuters.\n\n\"He (Macron) signalled a delay would be in no one's interest,\" the official said.\n\nIt was unlikely that the EU's 27 remaining member states would refuse Britain's delay request. Diplomats said on Sunday the bloc would play for time rather than rush to decide, waiting to see how things developed in London next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBREXIT LAW\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on getting Brexit done by the latest deadline of Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay the departure date. Parliament rejected her deal three times, by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year.\n\nHe had hoped to pass his own newly struck deal at an extraordinary sitting of parliament on Saturday but that was derailed by a legislative booby trap set by a rebel lawmaker concerned that Britain might still drop out without a deal.\n\nLawmakers voted 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment that turned Johnson's planned finale on its head by obliging him to ask the EU for a delay, and increasing the opportunity for opponents to frustrate Brexit.\n\nIn his own signed letter to Tusk, Johnson said he was confident that the process of getting the Brexit legislation through Britain's parliament would be completed before Oct. 31.\n\nFormer minister Amber Rudd said she and most of the 21 Conservatives kicked out of the ruling party over their bid to block a no-deal Brexit would support the deal and there was \"a fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it\".\n\nOliver Letwin, the lawmaker behind Saturday's booby trap, said on Sunday that he believed Johnson could probably get his Brexit deal over the line.", "description": "Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31 despite an unsigned letter that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced by his opponents to send to the bloc requesting a Brexit delay, the government said on Sunday.
