Bothell, Wash.-based Seattle Genetics said the trial of tucatinib in locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Patients were treated with tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine to trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. The trial also met its secondary endpoints. \"Based on these findings, we plan to unblind the trial and offer tucatinib to patients on the control arm,\" Chief Medical Officer Roger Dansey said in a statement. The company is also planning to submit a New Drug Application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020, he said.
