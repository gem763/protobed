The visits by Chinese officials to farms in Montana and Nebraska were unexpectedly called off, but now, Mnuchin stated the cancellation \"was purely at our request.''\n\nAfter Mnuchin explained the request to reschedule the farm visits, President Trump asked Mnuchin \"Why was that our request, just out of curiosity?\"\n\nMnuchin assured the president it was to avoid any confusion around the trade negotiations, but Trump responded to that by saying \"Yeah, but I want them to buy farm products.\"\n\n\"There was no confusion,\" Mnuchin clarified. \"We want them to buy agriculture. They've committed to buy agriculture.\"\n\nMnuchin clarified that discussion while speaking with Dobbs on Monday.\n\n\"The farmers and the fishermen are very important to the president,\" Mnuchin said. \"And I would say that we take it as a personal offense that they stopped buying agriculture.\"\n\nHowever, Mnuchin said the good news is the Chinese have agreed to start buying agriculture again.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nChina isn't the only Asian country the United States is currently negotiating with.
