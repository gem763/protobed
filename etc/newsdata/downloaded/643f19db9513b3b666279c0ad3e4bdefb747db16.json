Areas like Melrose Park and Wentworth Point are exploding and people have moved there on faith.\u201d\n\nWestern Sydney Business Chamber executive director David Borger said work needed to get underway as quickly as possible to expand what he described as Australia\u2019s fastest-growing and most congested line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical we get this new 25km tunnel in place as soon as we can,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Government says the ability to extend the line including beyond Westmead will be future-proofed.\n\nWith AAP", "description": "The locations of seven new Sydney stations have been revealed along the future Western Sydney Metro line.", "authors": ["Ben Graham"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/76e9fcffd193a706913f09561a81b6a4?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
