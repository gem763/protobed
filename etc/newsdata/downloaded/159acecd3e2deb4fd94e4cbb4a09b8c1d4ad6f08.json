But with House Democrats in the heat of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, the habits of political lifetimes collide with the imperatives of discipline and focus.\n\nAnd Democrats being Democrats, they are even arguing about who deserves credit for the decision to open an impeachment inquiry. When CNN posted a feature about how moderates moved the House to act, champions of the party\u2019s outspoken progressives, who had long endorsed this step, asked why they did not get more credit for being there all along.\n\nRep. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.), the vice chair of the House Democratic caucus, might be seen as representing something close to the exact center of her party, which is one reason I spoke with her here this week. She didn\u2019t think much of the debate over who deserves praise for what.\n\nA member of the Progressive Caucus, she came out for impeachment early, on July 25 \u2014 the very day, it turns out, when Trump had his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking him to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. Yet she also spent a lot of time helping moderate members win in 2018 as the co-chair of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cRed to Blue\u201d program. She thus hopes the party can quickly work its way past feuds and get on with the job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a matter of credit, or who was right, or vindicating the timing of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly understand members of Congress who say, \u2018Wasn\u2019t it enough with the racist policies? Wasn\u2019t it enough with the lies and contortions and the willingness to engage with Russia in trying to get dirt on Hillary Clinton? Wasn\u2019t it enough with the separation of children at the border?\u2019 But we are here now and we are pursuing this . . . with urgency, as expeditiously as we can.\u201d\n\nAnd she vigorously defended the moderate Democrats with \u201cnational security backgrounds\u201d who saw Trump\u2019s \u201cabuse of power\u201d in the Ukraine conversation as \u201can affront to them.\u201d Her fellow progressives, she added in a lesson she never tires of preaching, should \u201calways remember that we don\u2019t get to a majority without the more moderate and conservative members.\u201d\n\nYou sense from Clark and others among her colleagues that, despite the usual Democratic fractiousness, something important changed inside the party once the Gordian knot of impeachment was cut.\n\nFor one thing, as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) made clear at a news conference Wednesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Democrats will no longer allow the Trump administration to bog them down \u2014 and make them look hapless \u2014 by tying requests for witnesses in court. Now, Trump\u2019s delaying ploys \u201cwill be considered further evidence of obstruction,\u201d Schiff said. Thus has impeachment shifted the balance of power between Congress and the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are determined to challenge Trump every time he claims that impeachment is getting in the way of action on prescription drug prices, guns and other issues that helped elect the new moderates. Pelosi went out of her way to open the news conference by focusing on these questions, not impeachment. She said that if the president used the House\u2019s investigation as an excuse for governing sloth, \u201cthe ball is in his court.\u201d\n\nPelosi was speaking directly to the frustration of her colleagues, especially with the media (\u201cDoes anybody in this room care about the cost of prescription drugs?\u201d she asked at her news conference) that Clark channeled in our chat. \u201cI talk about helping end the epidemic of gun violence, I get asked about impeachment,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI talk about pay equity, I get asked about impeachment. I talk about raising the minimum wage, I get asked about impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe reality of impeachment will only make this problem worse, yet it has an additional effect: Because things have suddenly become so serious, Democrats just might learn to behave differently. \u201cWe have this fragile majority and right now we are all that stands between these attacks by the president and his enablers across the aisle on the fundamentals of our democracy,\u201d Clark said. If this responsibility doesn\u2019t concentrate the mind of a party that adores brawling, nothing will.\n\nRead more from E.J.
