Others have found their routes simpler, not having to take into account words from decades ago.\n\nAD\n\nThe latest example occurred after Trump on Tuesday morning said that the impeachment inquiry amounted to a \u201clynching.\u201d Biden and many other Democrats and Republicans denounced his use of the word and said it was intended to deepen racial wounds.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not \u2018lynching,\u2019 it is part of our Constitution,\u201d Biden tweeted in response. \u201cOur country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It\u2019s despicable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSymone Sanders, his top black staffer and surrogate, wrote on Twitter, \u201cDo not ever describe anything other than actual lynching, as a lynching.\u201d\n\nBut on Tuesday night, CNN unearthed a video of Biden in October 1998 using a similar phrase while talking about the impeachment of Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cEven if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\u201d Biden said in an interview with Wolf Blitzer.\n\nAD\n\nAfter several hours of criticism, Biden responded.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Biden tweeted Tuesday night.\n\nBiden quickly transitioned into a criticism of Trump, attempting to argue that he didn\u2019t mean to use the word divisively, whereas Trump did.\n\n\u201cTrump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBiden, whose standing in the race has been supported by a huge advantage among black voters, was not alone, however.\n\nThe Post identified at least five other Democratic lawmakers \u2014 current and former Reps. Danny K. Davis (Ill.), Gregory W. Meeks (N.Y.), Jim McDermott (Wash.), Charles B. Rangel (N.Y.), and Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) \u2014 who talked about a \u201clynching\u201d or \u201clynch mob\u201d when it came to Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nAD", "description": "The former vice president used the term to describe Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings, but balked at Trump using \u201clynching\u201d to describe his own.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e0ouE4eus4nMqiUeMm6jEOhJies=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L2DKOVHVUII6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
