It has a chapel on the school grounds and is one of the oldest independent schools in South Africa.\n\nThe school has several cricket, rugby and hockey fields, tennis and squash courts, a shooting range, as well as a gymnasium and an Olympic-size water polo pool. Its roughly 500 pupils are housed in seven houses on the school grounds.\n\n\u201cWithin the houses are well-appointed common rooms, prep and study areas, and recently upgraded ablutions which include private shower compartments,\u201d the school\u2019s website reads.\n\nEach house has a housemaster, which are \"senior appointments, and their lightened teaching loads enable them to pay careful attention to their charges\".
