Because of the haphazard way Apple\u2019s software releases are happening this fall, we\u2019re going to hold off on a full review for a little bit. All of the betas up to today have had bugs that range from the surreal to the show-stopping, and it\u2019s not fair to judge a final release on prerelease issues.\n\nIs it safe to install today? Based on the latest beta I\u2019ve been using, I think it is \u2014 and I also think it\u2019s well worth it. iPadOS is based on iOS 13, which Chaim reviewed here, but it feels like a much more substantial update than what we\u2019ve gotten on the iPhone.\n\nAnybody who has felt like the iPad was a little too limiting because of how it handled windows or webpages should be excited to install this update. And although it really does feel like a \u201cpower user\u201d-focused set of features this year, people who use their iPads for the basics will find things to like, too.\n\nHere are the things we like best and hate the most about iPadOS so far.\n\nGood: Safari works like a desktop browser, mostly\n\nOne of the more frustrating parts of using an iPad before is that you had this big screen that often only showed blown-up iPhone versions of websites. Blame it on web developers if you want, but the cold truth of the web is that its more advanced features expect a desktop browser with a mouse.\n\nApple\u2019s fix was to have the current Safari browser tell websites that is exactly what it is, the Mac version of Safari. That means websites are more likely to just show up as full desktop versions on the iPad.\n\nSo far so good, but you have probably noticed that the iPad doesn\u2019t have a mouse pointer (excepting a new accessibility option). So Apple added a sort of translation layer between your taps and the website\u2019s expectation of clicks. In some cases (like Google Docs), Apple has specifically checked to make sure its translation layer is working well.\n\nAnd it all does work really well, you get access to more of the web than before. But it\u2019s not perfect, you will find edge cases where you will still have to make your way back to a \u201creal\u201d desktop web browser on a laptop or PC to access certain sites. I\u2019ve had issues with sites that have complicated forms, text-entry fields, or that have some sort of drag-and-drop interface.\n\nGood: new ways to manage windows\n\nEven using the word \u201cwindows\u201d is weird on an iPad, it doesn\u2019t really fit. What I\u2019m talking about is putting apps into split screen, using Slide Over, and so on. With iPadOS, Apple has stopped being shy about offering power users power options, so you have more ways than ever to arrange and rearrange your windows. Er, \u201cspaces,\u201d in Apple parlance.\n\nThe biggest change is in Slide Over, the little windows that look like iPhone apps floating over on the right-hand side. Now you can have a whole stack of them and they have their own multitasking. I use it all the time now, accessing apps I want to quickly use and then dismiss. It\u2019s perfect for Messages, Music, and Notes. It really is like having a little iPhone on your iPad.\n\nBut there are a lot of other changes. Apps can now spawn multiple windows, for example. And you can drag and drop lots of things into new windows. You can use the Expose view not only to see all your split-screen spaces, but also all the individual windows for a specific app.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s very close to what power users have been asking for. Luckily, if you just want to use your iPad one app at a time like you always have, you can.\n\nBad: the learning curve on managing windows\n\nI just said it\u2019s a lot, but really that undersells how complicated multitasking can get on an iPad. I worried earlier this summer that it wasn\u2019t \u201cintuitive\u201d and the verdict is in: it is not.\n\nHow can you know if a link or a note or any random thing on the iPad can be turned into a window? Trial and error, mostly, though you can long-press to see if there\u2019s an \u201cOpen in new window\u201d option.\n\nThe iPad has different spatial metaphors than what we\u2019re used to on a desktop and there are a half-dozen odd ways to switch between and rearrange app windows. All of that is actually great. The problem is that going from the basics to feeling like you really know how things work requires a steep learning curve, one where iPadOS doesn\u2019t give you a lot of signals about what is happening to your stuff.\n\nMy advice: give up on the idea that your windows are anything like desktop windows at all, at least in terms of workspace permanence. You can\u2019t set things up \u201cjust so\u201d and expect everything to stay that way. They\u2019re all impermanent and so are your workspaces. It ends up working out because opening stuff on the iPad is so fast, but prepare to feel a little lost for quite a while.\n\nGood: the new home screen\n\nYou can set the home screen to have a more dense grid of icons and you can set your Today view widgets to be permanently pinned there. Long-pressing icons on the home screen feels a lot more responsive and the context menu that pops up is way more useful. Pro tip: just long-press and drag your finger up through the options when the menu pops up.\n\nGood: the floating keyboard\n\nYou can pinch the on-screen keyboard to turn it into a little iPhone-sized keyboard that can be dragged around anywhere on the screen. I love it so much \u2014 it\u2019s the rare case of Apple learning something from Chrome OS (yes, really!).\n\nIt\u2019s great because you can put it over on the right and use the new QuickPath option to slide your thumb over letters to type. It makes typing on the iPad when you\u2019re holding it much easier.\n\nBut the real reason it\u2019s great is that it lets you type without having a third of the screen taken up by the keyboard. The regular software keyboard cuts off too much content way too often.\n\nBad: Advanced text selection\n\nApple tried really hard to get text interactions right on iPadOS, and I think the goal was to make it a little faster and intuitive. You are supposed to just be able to tap or drag your finger to have the cursor do what you want, placing or highlighting or whatever. Then there are special gestures using three fingers to do things like cut and paste.\n\nText selection is one step forward, one step back, one wild leap over to the right for some reason\n\nIn theory, just trusting the iPad to naturally do what I want with text is a great idea. In practice, it\u2019s too unpredictable and hard to figure out. When does dragging move the cursor and when does dragging select text? After three months of using the iPadOS betas nearly every day, I still haven\u2019t gotten it right.\n\nPro tip: just ignore the three-finger gestures and learn the three-finger tap, which brings up a pop-up menu that\u2019s way easier to use.\n\nGood: the new, more powerful Files app\n\nWhen Apple switched the iPad Pro over to USB-C, everybody started thinking about that port as useful for something other than a charger. And with iOS 12, very few things actually worked.\n\nWith iPadOS, that port has been allowed to do more things, and the best set of features is in the Files app. It can read USB drives and cards directly now, and you can even unplug those devices without the operating system chiding you.\n\nBut Apple did much more than that. It added a column view, set it up to work better with external servers, and finally allows you to just set up and organize local folders more easily.\n\nRelated: Safari has a proper download manager now that can download nearly any file, not just the limited set that iOS allowed before.\n\nGood: Dark mode\n\nApple put some care into getting this right, it\u2019s far more than just an inversion of white and black. You\u2019ll find a surprising number of apps support it \u2014 even if they are still in the minority, it\u2019s more than I expected at this point.\n\nI especially like that you can just set it on a schedule, just like with Night Shift. I still think that dark mode is more of a UI trend than a genuine improvement, but that\u2019s not a knock against it. User interfaces have trends just like fashion, but I think dark mode is going to last if only because it makes the screen so much nicer to view at night.\n\nGood: Photos app\n\nIt really is a step up, and though the photo editing options aren\u2019t strictly new across the board, I find them much more intuitive and easier than before. What is new is the ability to apply all of that same stuff to video.\n\nYou might get a little lost in Apple\u2019s attempts to algorithmically show you the best stuff in the new timeline views inside the app, but stick with it. You\u2019re probably taking so many photos that it\u2019s worth letting Apple\u2019s AI take a crack at curating them a little bit for you.\n\nBad: Bugs\n\nThis has been a buggy year for the betas. Again, you should not judge what you are installing today based on this, but you might want to be prepared for some weirdness still. I can\u2019t help but think that iPadOS is getting pushed out a little early because it needs to go out with iOS 13.1 \u2014 which itself needs to be rushed out because iOS 13.0 is super buggy.\n\nLuckily, the most catastrophic bugs (like losing data in iCloud) seem to have been well and thoroughly quashed. But you might have some apps crash or freeze. Waiting a little longer to install \u2014 or at least avoiding installing on day one \u2014 is never a terrible idea. Barbara Krasnoff has written a good how-to guide for how to do it on the iPhone that applies equally well to the iPad.\n\nEverything else: pretty good!\n\nThere are many, many more features to talk about. I\u2019m particularly fond of Apple\u2019s new privacy-protection features, which make it harder for both apps and webpages to identify you for tracking. I\u2019m also glad Apple finally figured out that you might want to long-press the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi icons to access some Bluetooth and Wi-Fi options in Control Center \u2014 what a concept!\n\nIf you want a deep dive on absolutely everything, Frederico Viticci has gone well and truly overboard examining every nook and cranny over at MacStories. We\u2019ll have our full review after we\u2019ve kicked the tires on the final, shipping version of iPadOS a little more.", "description": "Anybody who has felt like the iPad was a little too limiting because of how it handled windows or webpages should be excited to install this update.
