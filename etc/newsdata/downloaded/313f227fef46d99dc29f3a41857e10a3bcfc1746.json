These parallels were endlessly hyped when the Hulu series, conceived and filmed before the 2016 election, premiered in April 2017, several months after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. At the time, it was hailed in major publications as \u201ctimely,\u201d \u201cprescient,\u201d and \u201calarmingly close to home,\u201d despite bearing no resemblance to the actual alarming things happening under the Trump presidency.\n\nNotably, Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel itself was partly inspired by the rise of the Christian right in the United States in the 1980s. And, for all its qualities\u2014keen insights into the realities of totalitarianism, nuanced character dynamics, a sympathetic everywoman heroine struggling to survive under horrific oppression\u2014it fails utterly if taken seriously as a potential scenario for America\u2019s slide into religious dictatorship.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale is based on the premise that an American Taliban\u2014a presumably Christian cult that espouses biblical fundamentalism without ever mentioning Jesus\u2014could infiltrate the United States military enough to seize power after a coup. It also assumes that most Americans could quickly adjust to a \u201cnew normal\u201d in which heretics and gays are publicly hanged while women are forbidden to work, own property, or read. (A small cadre of female enforcers, the \u201cAunts,\u201d have a little more leeway.) Atwood\u2019s explanation of her reasoning\u2014revolutions always build on society\u2019s existing foundations, and therefore social chaos in the U.S. could bring about a radical regime that draws on its deep roots of 17th-century New England Puritanism\u2014shows mainly that she understands neither America nor Puritanism.\n\nRead: The challenge of Margaret Atwood\n\nYet, for beleaguered feminists and other progressives in Trump\u2019s America, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale became both a symbol of oppression and a call to arms for the female-led Resistance. In the second season, which moved past Atwood\u2019s material, the show itself began playing to such parallels with ripped-from-the-headlines themes\u2014from evil Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (here working to keep people in, not out) to attacks on the press (seen in grisly traces of a massacre at the abandoned Boston Globe building). Season 3, in which the heroine went full resistance fighter, was chided even by sympathetic reviewers for turning the story into a simplistic empowerment fantasy starring an \u201cunstoppable Feminist Badass,\u201d as a Time writer put it.\n\nThe Testaments, though a far more nuanced work than the Hulu series, still has a streak of empowerment fantasy that panders to the current mood. Here, it\u2019s the fearsome Aunt Lydia\u2014the odious matron of the first book and the show, implausibly revealed as a secret subversive\u2014who takes on the role of the Feminist Badass successfully plotting to bring down Gilead, with assistance from two plucky teenage girls.", "description": "The Handmaid\u2019s Tale isn\u2019t coming true.
