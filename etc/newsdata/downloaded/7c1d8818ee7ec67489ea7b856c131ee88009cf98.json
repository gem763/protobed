The Northwest D.C. tavern is trying to bring that back.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nDonald Tillery performs during a Tuesday night jazz jam session at Takoma Station in March 2013. The tavern is starting a monthly jazz night. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nMarshall Keys remembers when Takoma Station was the hippest, busiest jazz gig in town. \u201cThe line of people trying to get in would go down to the corner,\u201d says the alto saxophonist, whose band played at the Upper Northwest tavern every Thursday from 1986 to 1994. \u201cTo this day people will stop me on the street and say, \u2018I came to see you back in the day at Takoma Station.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavid Boyd remembers those days, too. His father, Bobby (who died in 2011), owned the club; the younger Boyd helped run it and eventually became a co-owner.\n\n\u201cIt was packed every night \u2014 I\u2019m talking Sunday to Sunday,\u201d he says. \u201cSome magical thing happened and made it really a big social event.\u201d\n\nThe club has remained successful even after switching to R&B, but Boyd misses the elegant, chilled-out vibe that once dwelt inside its brick walls. He\u2019s enlisted Michael Philips, a onetime regular who\u2019s now music director of Takoma\u2019s WOWD-FM, to help bring jazz back to\n\nTakoma Station.\n\nThe experiment begins Sunday night with Carr-Keys, a quintet that Keys co-leads with tenor saxophonist Paul Carr \u2014 another weekly booking from the club\u2019s jazz heyday.\n\nCarr also has fond memories of that time. \u201cIt was the place, man. Everybody would come to the Station,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be nice to re-create at least some modicum of that.\u201d\n\n[D.C. jazz is making a comeback. You\u2019ll just find it in unexpected places.]\n\nTakoma Station\u2019s customer base was Howard University students, drawn to the 1980s jazz renaissance spawned by the likes of Wynton Marsalis. The charismatic young trumpeter sat in at the club whenever he was in town. So did musicians from veteran vibraphonist Lionel Hampton to teenage organist Joey DeFrancesco.\n\n\n\nStevie Wonder (far left) once sat in with Marshall Keys (sax), Keith Killgo (drums) and Scott Ambush (bass) for a set at Takoma Station. (Photo courtesy of Marshall Keys)\n\nOlder customers who grew up on jazz soon found Takoma Station. Then as now, Howard student haunts attracted the attention of African American elites. \u201cI met Don King there, and Welsey Snipes,\u201d Carr recalls. \u201cBernard Shaw, the anchor at CNN, would come every Tuesday night and listen to me and the band.\u201d\n\nIf Tuesday night drew big names, Carr, Keys and Boyd all agree that Thursday night \u2014 Keys\u2019s \u2014 drew everyone. \u201cIt was super popular,\u201d says Keys. \u201cWe were doing contemporary jazz, all instrumental songs and nice grooves \u2014 really hip stuff. We would crank it up, and everybody was clapping. \u2026 It was fantastic.\u201d One night, Stevie Wonder even sat in.\n\nTastes inevitably changed; the new generation of college students wasn\u2019t interested in jazz, and the previous one had moved on from the club scene.\n\n\u201cIt was time to try something new,\u201d says Boyd, who, as a native Washingtonian and a child of the \u201970s, loved go-go music. \u201cI started with Chuck Brown once a month, and it was a huge success. I did reggae also, and reggae was humongous; then I did comedy, and that was bigger than any other night. All I was doing was following the trend \u2014 going with what worked.\u201d\n\n[Where can you hear some of D.C.\u2019s best jazz musicians for five bucks on a Friday night?

(Jon T Miller Photography)\n\nThese days, R&B and some go-go make up most of the programming; jazz holds sway on Tuesday nights in the form of a weekly jam session, which is spottily attended and mostly attracts hobbyist musicians. Yet Takoma Station celebrates its jazz heritage. Its bar menu offers items such as the Donald Byrd turkey burger and Sarah Vaughan tenders, and a plaque outside its front entrance displays a photograph of Wynton Marsalis with Bobby Boyd.\n\nMeanwhile, Boyd senses another sea change in D.C.\u2019s music scene.\n\n\u201cI think jazz is making a certain type of resurgence,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it could do something \u2014 in the right room.\u201d\n\nPhilips happened to suggest the possibility a few months ago at a Tuesday night session. \u201cI said to David, \u2018You know, I think it would be great if you brought jazz back here on some nights.\u2019 He said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it? We\u2019ll start out once a month, and if it\u2019s successful then we\u2019ll do it weekly.\u2019 So I kind of backed into doing this.\u201d\n\n[Alice\u2019s Jazz and Cultural Society is unlike any club in D.C., and maybe anywhere]\n\n\n\nTakoma Station, shown here in 2013, has long been a destination for music in the D.C. area. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nThat said, Philips is committed to the project \u2014 he\u2019s already booked trombonist Reginald Cyntje for the second installment, on Oct. 27 \u2014 which augurs success. Another good omen is the premiere\u2019s featuring of Carr-Keys, led by two of Takoma Station\u2019s most popular former stalwarts. The saxophonists combine with a superlative D.C. rhythm section (pianist Allyn Johnson, bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Lenny Robinson) to play bebop-based straight-ahead jazz.\n\n\u201cCarr-Keys has become my favorite thing to do,\u201d says Keys. \u201cEvery time we do it, it\u2019s exhilarating.\u201d\n\nBoyd hopes that, along with their current fans, Carr and Keys will bring in some Takoma Station nostalgia. \u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll be able to generate more people to come in and remember the old days, when that was what we had to offer,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope we can turn it around for jazz \u2014 I would like for it to happen.\u201d", "description": "The quintet Carr-Keys plays on Sunday, the first in a series of monthly jazz nights.", "authors": ["Michael J.
