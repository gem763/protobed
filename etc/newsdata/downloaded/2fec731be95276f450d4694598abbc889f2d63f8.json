Over several months, the multimedia project will share stories that retrace slavery\u2019s impact on America.\n\nThe project highlights the Tucker family, who believe its American journey began with some of the first slaves who landed in the British colony of Virginia. Earlier this month, USA TODAY journalists traveled with Wanda Tucker from Virginia to Angola, where she believes her ancestors were captured and enslaved. Four journalists spent 10 days with Wanda on what she called \u201ca life-changing journey,\u201d as she searched for answers for herself and her family.\n\n\u201cI believed that the ancestors called me to take this journey,\u201d said Tucker. \u201cI really hope to do justice to my ancestors.\u201d\n\n\"The landing of the first enslaved Africans in 1619 is one of the most important events and dates in our history, but it hasn't been treated as such,\" said USA TODAY Editor-in-Chief Nicole Carroll. \"We set out to correct that. Our goal is to educate and inform Americans about the history that continues to shape and influence the country we are today.\u201d\n\nThe \u201c1619: Searching for Answers\u201d launch also includes an interactive augmented reality (AR) experience about the journey enslaved Africans made aboard the San Juan Bautista boat through the dangerous and deadly Middle Passage. The AR interactive was written by best-selling author Dolen Perkins-Valdez, narrated by storyteller Tamara Winfrey-Harris and showcases a painting by noted Hampton artist Richard Press Sr. Users will have the opportunity to step into a virtual representation of San Juan Bautista with spacial audio components, creating an immersive experience of being at sea. The experience guides users through historical events that have been researched and documented by USA TODAY\u2019s editorial team, including the ship attack that led the enslaved Africans to Virginia. This experience marks the ninth project of 2019 for the USA TODAY\u2019s emerging technology team which has committed to a dozen projects this year. The experience can be found within the new augmented reality section of the USA TODAY mobile app for iOS and Android.\n\nThe full multiplatform report featuring video and multiple graphics \u2013 including one showing slavery\u2019s exponential growth \u2013 can be found at 1619.usatoday.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/08/22/usa-today-launches-1619-searching-answers-interactive-augmented-reality-expose/2081937001/", "description": "The multiplatform series observing 400 years since the landing of the first enslaved Africans in Virginia gets personal with journalists joining a woman on a journey from Virginia to Angola in search of her family\u2019s story.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
