Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u2019 presidential campaign, was fired Friday after repeatedly being accused recently of unspecified inappropriate behavior.\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks, senior campaign leadership received multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior by Rich McDaniel,\u201d campaign spokesperson Kristen Orthman said in a statement, POLITICO first reported.\n\n\u201cOver the same time period, the campaign retained outside counsel to conduct an investigation. Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\nMr. McDaniel held a leading role within the Warren campaign as national organizing director prior to being cut, and his departure came on the heels of recent nationwide polling showing support for the candidate making her a viable challenger to current Democratic front-runner and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cI have separated from the campaign and am no longer serving as National Organizing Director,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said in a statement. \u201cI have tremendous respect for my colleagues despite any disagreements we may have had and believe departing at this time is in the best interest of both parties.\n\n\u201cI would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values. If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree. I wish the campaign and my colleagues well,\u201d said the statement, POLITICO reported.\n\nMr. McDaniel had been among the first hires announced by the Warren campaign and was brought on board in January weeks before the candidate officially entered the 2020 race. He previously worked on Democratic political campaigns including Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for the White House in 2016, as well as the campaign that resulted in Sen. Doug Jones winning Alabama in 2017.\n\nSeveral recent polls have placed Ms. Warren among the top two or three Democratic candidates seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run next year against President Trump, placing her alongside Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont Independent.\n\nMs. Warren briefly addressed the staffer\u2019s firing later Friday, CBS News reported.\n\n\u201cI want us to have a campaign that lives our values and that lifts up inclusivity,\u201d Ms. Warren told reporters, according to the outlet. \u201cIt is really hard for anyone to come forward with a complaint or with a concern, and the people who did that showed incredible courage.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
