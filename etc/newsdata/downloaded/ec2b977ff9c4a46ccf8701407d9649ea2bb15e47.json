Kim Reynolds signed a proclamation declaring Sept. 28 \u201cCarson King Day.\u201d\n\nReynolds, joined by Carson, read the proclamation aloud and signed it in her formal office in the Capitol Wednesday afternoon. https://t.co/DUCrqwctLW \u2014 Des Moines Register (@DMRegister) September 25, 2019\n\nPlenty of other businesses and charities stepped up to fill the void left by Anheuser-Busch and local brewery Geneseo Brewing Co. announced that it would brew a new pilsner named \u201cIowa Legend.\u201d\n\n\"We have witnessed your growth through your later social media content and accept your apology,\" Geneseo Brewing Co., which plans to honor King with a newly released Pilsner, wrote on Facebook. https://t.co/hp6Wk9siTa \u2014 Des Moines Register (@DMRegister) September 25, 2019\n\n\"Witnessed your growth\" like he robbed banks. But you did a hit job regarding the freaking tweets of a guy who helped sick kids. You're still framing this the same way because you don't feel bad. What you publish is so much more disgusting than lousy jokes. https://t.co/MVB6kbpBHT \u2014 Anthony Bialy (@AnthonyBialy) September 26, 2019\n\nYeah, the paper\u2019s been getting slammed all day long in the comments to every post, deservedly so. What was that reporter\u2019s name who dug up the old tweets? Aaron Calvin?\n\nDid you investigate this? pic.twitter.com/PS3C4pprgx \u2014 Cash Bailey (@Gotrek68) September 25, 2019\n\nSo you jeopardized potentially 2 million dollars of a donation for a children\u2019s hospital because of your reporter\u2019s intent to \u2018cancel\u2019 Carson, then pump out fluff pieces to try and hide your mistake. Is that what\u2019s happening here? \u2014 Justin Michael Davis (@juhdavis) September 25, 2019\n\nCorrected headline: Since We Tried To Ruin A Man's Life, Other Businesses Had To Jump In And Support His Charity Since We Chased Away A Large Donor. \u2014 Jacob Airey (@realJacobAirey) September 25, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s really nice of them to accept Carson\u2019s apology. I\u2019m sure Carson would be willing to accept an apology from @aaronpcalvin \u2014 Beto\u2019s blind squirrel (@ItsToad_) September 25, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re still waiting for your apology to Mr. King. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/tprCW8osNU \u2014 WanderingAg (@AgWandering) September 25, 2019\n\nYou horrible people ruined a mans life.

Choose which master you're going to serve. \u2014 Love your enemies +++\u2626 (@JoyceWitt19) September 25, 2019\n\nIf I had to pick, I'm guessing the \"investigation\" is really \"figuring out how to protect our own\" since someone getting fired might look like an admission of guilt or hypocrisy. \u2014 Hotep Dad Max Rockatansky (@BenedictineP_nk) September 25, 2019\n\nThis story includes the line, \"A Des Moines Register reporter learned about King's past social media posts while writing\u2026\" It's not only unfortunate you don't name the reporter, it lacks transparency. Transparency is the foundation for journalism. You can't have it both ways. \u2014 Kevin Mac (@lowercase_kevin) September 26, 2019\n\nTucker Carlson dropping the nuke on the Des Moines Register right now!! pic.twitter.com/0zif6XCC29 \u2014 Fuzzy Dunlop (@FuzzyDunlop235) September 26, 2019\n\nWhere's the apology?! \u2014 Skipper (@BillyBacus) September 25, 2019\n\nThis.
