Hence my nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which included the text messages, was written jointly by the chairmen of the House committees on intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs, and was circulated publicly following a marathon deposition on Capitol Hill from one of the pressure campaign\u2019s key participants, the Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, whom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed into resigning last week.\n\n\u201cThese text messages reflect serious concerns raised by a State Department official about the detrimental effects of withholding critical military assistance from Ukraine, and the importance of setting up a meeting between President Trump and the Ukrainian president without further delay,\u201d the chairmen wrote. \u201cHe also directly expressed concerns that this critical military assistance and the meeting between the two presidents were being withheld in order to place additional pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the president\u2019s demand for Ukraine to launch politically motivated investigations.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, in comments to The Daily Beast late Thursday, said \u201cmilitary aid never came up in the conversations I had with [Gordon] Sondland or Kurt\u201d Volker, adding \u201cI feel vindicated when I look at the texts. It certainly shows I was being directed by them [in the State Department]. They brought me into it. They were calling the shots. There were a lot of things they were doing that I didn\u2019t know about. It shows they weren\u2019t upset with anything I was doing. Nor do I find anything they did irregular... Seems to me they were doing their jobs effectively. Nothing at all sinister about it.\u201d\n\nWhile the impeachment inquiry is being spearheaded by the intelligence committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has become a main target of Trump and his allies, the House Oversight and Government Reform and Foreign Affairs committees led by Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings and New York Rep. Eliot Engel, respectively, also have ongoing investigations as a part of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nLess than a week before Trump\u2019s infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky\u2014in which the president responded to Zelensky\u2019s interest in buying additional anti-tank missiles by asking Zelensky for \u201ca favor\u201d\u2014Volker connected Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak with Giuliani. He texted with Sondland afterward that it would be \u201cmost impt\u201d that Zelensky say on the upcoming call between the two presidents \u201cthat he will help investigation.\u201d\n\nTaylor began to grow concerned. He texted Sondland that the Ukrainians did not want to be seen as \u201can instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\u201d Sondland, whom the committees seek to depose over Pompeo\u2019s objections, replied that \u201cwe need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, regardless of the pretext.\u201d\n\nThe texts also indicate that the senior National Security Council official responsible for Russia and related affairs, Tim Morrison, was aware of the effort in some form. Sondland texted three days before the Trump-Zelensky call\u2014something Giuliani \u201cwas advocating,\u201d Volker texted on July 22\u2014that he spoke with Morrison.\n\nOn July 25, shortly before the call occurred, Volker said he had heard \u201cfrom White House\u201d that they might work out an in-person meeting between Trump and Zelensky \u201cassuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2019get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016.\u201d On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky for help discrediting Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s already-completed investigation into Russian interference in the election, which pointedly did not exonerate Trump.\n\nZelensky appeared to think his meeting with Trump was on. Sondland noted on Aug. 9, \u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable\u201d: a public commitment to investigate Trump\u2019s enemies. Sondland proposed getting a draft statement from the Ukrainians. Yermak told Volker that Zelensky wanted a commitment for a bilateral meeting before the Ukrainians made their announcement. The Americans reached out to Giuliani about the statement.\n\nBy Aug. 13, Volker and Sondland texted about the proposed Ukrainian statement. It was to declaim \u201cinterference in the political processes of the United States\u201d while roping Ukraine into them, through promising a \u201ctransparent and unbiased investigation\u201d that specifically mentioned Burisma, the natural-gas concern on whose board Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat for no reason besides his name, \u201cand the 2016 elections.\u201d Four days later, Sondland asked, \u201cDo we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Burisma?\u201d Volker replied: \u201cThat\u2019s the clear message so far\u2026\u201d\n\nBut neither the statement nor the meeting happened. Yermak panicked after reading a Politico story about Trump holding up the military aid for Ukraine. Then Trump canceled the plans for the two leaders to meet.\n\nBy Sept. 1, Taylor grew panicked himself. Incredulous, the charge d\u2019affairs texted Sondland: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Whatever Sondland replied was not contained in the texts. \u201cCall me,\u201d he told Taylor instead. (On Friday morning, Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor announced a review of the closure of past investigations of Burisma.)\n\nThat call is likely to be of substantial interest to the House Democratic impeachment inquiry. The three chairmen told their colleagues late Thursday in their letter, \u201cThis is not normal or acceptable. It is unethical, unpatriotic and wrong.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d objected the charge d\u2019affairs in Kyiv.", "authors": ["Jackie Kucinich", "Spencer Ackerman", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Washington Bureau Chief", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570164125/191003-Ackerman-Kucinich-Rudy-Trump-tease_x6wiev", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
