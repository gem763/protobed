Phillip Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at the presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston.\n\nHOUSTON \u2015 After two debates that did not feature the leading Democratic presidential candidates all on one stage, Thursday\u2019s showdown finally felt like a real debate, with establishment front-runner Joe Biden sparring with the progressive challengers close at his heels in the polls, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as other moderates in the race.\n\nThe 10 candidates ditched the introductory boilerplate and dived straight into their differences on health care and the economy, executing veiled shots at each other they\u2019ve telegraphed for weeks. But the highly anticipated face-off between Biden, Warren, and Sanders, the three polling leaders in the race, never really came to a head beyond one exchange on health care.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to pay for it?\u201d Biden asked moments after the debate began, referring to the universal health care plan backed by both Sanders and Warren. \u201cI want to hear that tonight. My distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it,\u201d he said, referring to Warren.\n\n\u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d the former vice president added, name-dropping former President Barack Obama.\n\nWarren responded by saying \u201cwe all owe a huge debt to President Obama,\u201d who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic electorate, and explained that she planned to make the richest individuals pay for her plan. Sanders, who has made his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan the signature feature of his candidacy, also made sure not to miss a dig at Biden.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign previewed his attacks in the days leading up to the debate as advisers repeatedly argued that Democrats should select a nominee able to offer \u201cmore than plans,\u201d a reference to Warren\u2019s most popular line on the campaign trail, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d\n\nThe highly anticipated face-off between Biden, Warren, and Sanders, the three polling leaders in the race, never really came to a head.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, took swipes of her own ahead of the debate that were widely seen as focusing on Biden. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly touted how she is not \u201cspending my time with high-dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists,\u201d a reference to the former vice president\u2019s fundraising events with well-heeled donors.\n\nThe tension between the two campaigns spilled out into the open on the eve of the debate after former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Warren a \u201chypocrite\u201d and saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have any trouble\u201d taking his money until she swore off high-dollar fundraisers for her presidential bid this year.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign told reporters on Thursday that he was not involved in the decision to publish the op-ed.\n\nThe expected fireworks between the two candidates fizzled on stage, however. Warren did not bring up the op-ed, and apart from her remarks on Medicare for All, she played it safe by focusing on her plans for the economy and taking on corruption in Washington. Biden ignored Warren\u2019s former work in bankruptcy law and clients, continuing to make his case about \u201crestoring the soul of America\u201d amid the chaotic tenure of President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, meanwhile, delivered one of the sharpest attacks against Biden when he insinuated that the onetime Delaware senator\u2019s memory might be failing him.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you just said two minutes ago?\u201d he said during an exchange on health care, eliciting some gasps from the audience and reprimands from several other candidates on stage. The line appeared to evoke some critics\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s mental acuity.\n\nThat was a kinda low attack from Castro to keep repeating \"you're forgetting\" when Biden clearly wasn't forgetting what he had said. The real attack there was too obvious. \u2014 Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d lamented South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg afterward. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed, chiming in with, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d\n\nBiden campaign adviser Anita Dunn responded by telling reporters that Castro \u201cclearly didn\u2019t learn from the first two debates that taking personal cheap shots at Vice President Biden actually doesn\u2019t work out that well.\u201d\n\nBut New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) seemed to back up Castro in a later interview with CNN, stating that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear, however, if the damage to Biden over the course of the night was severe enough to knock him from his front-runner perch.\n\nOther lower-ranked candidates also had standout moments during the night.\n\nButtigieg got emotional in his closing remarks while talking about coming out as gay when the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy forced LGBTQ members of the military to keep quiet about their sexual orientation.\n\nFormer Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke won applause when he reiterated his support for a mandatory gun-buyback program of assault weapons on Thursday. O\u2019Rourke vowed: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar took a swing at Sanders over the specifics in his health care plan, saying \u2019While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill and ... it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\u201d\n\nAnd the audience loved California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 opening remarks in which he spoke directly into the camera and addressed Trump and his policies. \u201cNow, Mr. President, you can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments during and after the debate.", "description": "The much-anticipated confrontation between leading 2020 candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders never really came to fruition.", "authors": ["Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b0a6823000010055260d2.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
