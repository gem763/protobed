They said:\n\n\u201cI just made a little 'typo' test and entered 'tezor[dot]io' where I obviously left out the 'r'. I was instantly redirected to a site called https://trezor[dot]run/start/ which is not the original trezor site (the correct size is http://trezor.io respectively https://trezor.io/start/).\u201d\n\nThe Reddit user said that a URL typo would indeed redirect the user to the Trezor scam site while possibly installing compromised firmware.\n\nBitcoin engineer and self-proclaimed BTC maximalist Jameson Lopp took to Twitter to warn about the fake website. Lopp \u2014 who is also CTO at Bitcoin key security system firm Casa \u2014 wrote:\n\n\u201cSECURITY NOTICE Users of @Trezor's web wallet should NOT visit it by typing \u2018http://trezor.io\u2019 into your browser - if you mis-type the URL you may be redirected to an imposter site that will try to steal your BTC! Bookmarks are your friend!\u201d\n\nMalicious app imitates hardware wallet Trezor\n\nCointelegraph reported on May 23 that scammers had been adding fake cryptocurrency wallets to the Google Play store. The malicious app imitated the Trezor hardware wallet. While looking completely legitimate on Google Play, the software itself contained no Trezor branding at all, with a generic login screen phishing for credentials.\n\nIn November 2018, Trezor warned its users after fraudsters began to make counterfeit versions of its hardware wallets. Company officials acknowledged at the time that \u201cTrezor clones have been released over the years,\u201d but a \u201cfake Trezor device, manufactured by a different, unknown vendor\u201d was a startling discovery.", "description": "A Redditor has discovered an apparent imposter website for Bitcoin hardware wallet Trezor", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYmViZDA4Zjg4OTBlMjJiNDlmN2M0MzBkZWMyMjBhNGYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
