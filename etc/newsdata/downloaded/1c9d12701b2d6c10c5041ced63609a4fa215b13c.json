However, due to the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, requesting a snap election requires a two-thirds majority in the House.\n\nLabour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn has shut down Johnson\u2019s requests, giving him the distinction of being the only opposition leader in British history to block a general election \u2014 leading to accusations in the house and elsewhere that he is running scared of a vote.\n\nDeltapoll voting intentions taken throughout 2019 \u2013 Britain Elects poll tracker underneath.

A Labour spokesman also said on Wednesday that the party\u2019s priority is to ensure that a no-deal Brexit is completely ruled out before backing a snap election.\n\nThe decision by Corbyn and the Labour Party to block a General Election has left the current Johnson government in a state of limbo, unable to enact the prime minister\u2019s pledge to deliver Brexit on time.\n\nLabour\u2019s unwillingness to allow British voters to go to the polls has led some to call their political tactics anti-democratic. Brendan O\u2019Neill of Spiked described the current situation as a \u201cparliamentary dictatorship\u201d, writing that:\n\n\u201cThe shamelessness is quite staggering. They plot ceaselessly against the people\u2019s democratic wishes and then they cushion themselves from our judgement by continually blocking a General Election. The end result is something like a parliamentary dictatorship.\n\n\u201cWe now live under a parliament that is acting against the democratic interests of the people and which is preventing us from protesting about this fact at the ballot box.\u201d", "description": "More than twice as many Britons support an \"immediate\" general election to select a fresh Parliament as those who oppose.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/General-Election-Now-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
