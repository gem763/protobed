Some Trump allies have been circulating names in recent days of possible replacements for Mulvaney as chief of staff. A group of conservatives decided to write the letter during a meeting in Washington last week, according to a second source familiar with the process.\n\nThe conservatives\u2019 letter to the White House chalks the criticism of Mulvaney to the \u201cD.C. Swamp\u201d attacking him.\n\nMulvaney faced strong criticism over the last week for two televised appearances \u2014 first during a White House briefing and then a Fox News Sunday interview in which he tried to clarify details of the Ukraine scandal only to raise more questions about his and the president\u2019s involvement in holding up aid to Ukraine. Democrats seized on his comments as evidence that the White House engaged in a quid pro quo, threatening to withhold funding to Ukraine until its leaders agreed to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.\n\nInside the White House, Mulvaney and his aides have also been at odds with other White House staffers and attorneys over control and the best course of action on the administration\u2019s impeachment strategy.\n\nAn administration official said Mulvaney did not know about the letter until he saw news reports about it on Thursday.\n\nTo key parts of the conservative movement, Mulvaney remains a strong leader.\n\n\u201cAs director of the Office of Management and Budget and as acting White House chief of staff, Mulvaney has overseen the office most responsible for implementing the Trump agenda throughout the government. His attention, vision, and commitment to the president\u2019s policies have been evident from the beginning of the administration to today. We believe the president should make him permanent in the chief of staff role,\u201d the letter says.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/60/e5/33ae439e4b86b0ad990f32360145/191024-mick-mulvaney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
