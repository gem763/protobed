For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nWe\u2019re back with more exclusive deals for readers of The Verge. If you weren\u2019t following along yesterday, we debuted a bunch of hand-picked deals on tech products. To sum it up, several deals on laptops, fast-charging wall chargers, and Ring smart home tech are still happening.\n\nToday, we\u2019re shifting focus to phones, with a few exclusive offers on unlocked devices, followed by a bunch of tech to complement your mobile phone. Qi wireless chargers, portable batteries, headphones, and a site-wide discount on Speck cases are just a few examples of what you\u2019ll find below.\n\nOur friends at Polygon are also running several exclusive deals on games, consoles, and more.\n\nSony Xperia 1 unlocked smartphone (compatible with GSM carriers and Verizon) is $849.99 (usually $949.99) at B&H Photo.\n\nThis is Sony\u2019s best phone yet, featuring a big, tall 6.5-inch 4K OLED 21:9 aspect ratio display that\u2019s still easy to fit into a pocket. It has a Snapdragon 855 processor, and it\u2019s surprisingly good at taking low-light shots, according to Dieter Bohn\u2019s review. This phone presents a few hang-ups, one of which is its original $950 price. Our exclusive deal with B&H Photo knocks $100 off.\n\nIt\u2019s also available in Purple.\n\nSamsung Galaxy A50 unlocked smartphone (white, compatible with GSM carriers only, dual-SIM) is $249.99 (usually $279.99) at B&H Photo.\n\nMost of Samsung\u2019s phones cost well over $500, but the Galaxy A50 might have more than enough power and features for your needs. It certainly looks and feels like a high-end phone, but at $250, it\u2019s a great deal if you\u2019re on a GSM carrier like AT&T or T-Mobile. This international version of the Galaxy A50 is covered by a one-year B&H Photo warranty, protecting it against manufacturer defects, as a Samsung warranty would.\n\nIt\u2019s also available in Black or Blue.\n\nPhone accessories and wearables\n\nRavPower\u2019s Fast Charge Qi wireless pad is $22.49 (includes power adapter) at Amazon after you clip the $3 coupon on the product page, then enter the offer code TVPC03423. RavPower Fast Charge Qi wireless stand is $26 (usually $47.99, includes power adapter) at Amazon with the offer code TVPC06934.\n\nThese wireless chargers come in a two-way tie in Chaim Gartenberg\u2019s roundup of the best options. That\u2019s because they\u2019re equally good in all the ways that matter (charging speeds that scale up to 10W, they\u2019re affordable, the design is simplistic, and they both include a 24W wall charger). But, one may appeal to you over the other. The pad is great if you don\u2019t mind setting your phone down to charge. However, the stand will be more useful if you want to have your phone upright while charging. This is especially handy for iPhones that require Face ID to unlock, since this stand orients the phone much like how you would hold it in your hand.\n\nMophie is offering a 20 percent discount for readers of The Verge on its mobile accessories, including portable batteries and charging cases. You can use the code on anything, including Mophie\u2019s new Dual Wireless Charging Pad pictured above. Use the offer code VERGE20 at checkout to save.\n\nHeadphones\n\nStatus Audio (makers of the CB-1, the excellent wired headphones above that already don\u2019t cost much) is offering Verge readers a 20 percent discount on anything you buy site-wide. Use the offer code VERGE20 to save on some headphones.", "description": "This is day two of The Verge\u2019s deals event, where we\u2019re giving readers exclusive discounts on tech, including the Sony Xperia 1, Samsung Galaxy A50, Ravpower and Mophie accessories, and much more.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YcWh1dQPk19NY9gffr3G_hWmGU4=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279846/vpavic_190701_3521_0014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-13"}
