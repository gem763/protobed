REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese hotel chain Unizo Holdings (3258.T) said on Monday it would continue talks with Blackstone Group (BX.N), which last week submitted a buyout offer despite previous rejections.\n\nBlackstone last week told Unizo it would launch a tender offer at 5,000 yen a share and warned the company it might take more aggressive measures if Unizo did not agree to the conditions by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have carefully evaluated and considered Blackstone\u2019s offer. And today all the board members agreed to continue talks with Blackstone as its proposals could help maintain and improve corporate value and secure shareholders benefit,\u201d Unizo said in a statement.\n\nThe bid from Blackstone marked another twist in the takeover saga surrounding the once-obscure hotelier, now seen as a test case for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push for greater transparency and corporate disclosure. Unizo has already rejected other buyout proposals from Blackstone as well as one from a \u201clocally renowned\u201d fund that it did not identify.\n\nUnizo also withdrew support in September for awhite-knight bid from SoftBank-backed (9984.T) FortressInvestment Group. In July, it was a target for travel agentH.I.S.
