The latter had established a de facto state in the north of Syria during the past years \u2014 in large parts in places previously ruled by the Islamic State. The Kurds hoped their territory was somewhat protected by a U.S. military presence that acted as a deterrent.\n\nAD\n\nHow did we get to this point?\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long viewed the Kurdish-held territory in Syria as a haven for the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK \u2014 which Erdogan considers to be a terrorist group.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, to the south of the Kurdish-held territories, Russia and Iran-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been waiting for an opportunity to seize back the cities and swaths of land he lost during the war.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement of a pullout one week ago offered an opening for both Erdogan and Assad. On Wednesday, Turkish troops began their offensive at multiple points along the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish artillery fire on the Kurds, a mass exodus of civilians and apparent footage of roadside executions of Kurdish fighters soon followed. Hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped detention, according to Kurdish officials.\n\nAD\n\nWithout U.S. backing and amid mounting chaos, the Kurds appeared to face the choice between a deadly confrontation with the militarily superior Turkish forces \u2014 or a deal with the Assad regime.\n\nAD\n\nBy Sunday, the SDF had opted for the second option: They announced a deal with the Syrian government to allow forces loyal to the regime to enter its territory. By Monday, Syrian government troops were raising flags in the towns close to the Turkish-Syrian border in a move that could make the presence of the remaining U.S. troops in the region unsustainable.\n\nHow do the Assad regime, Russia and Iran benefit?\n\nWith the United States voluntarily giving up much of its leverage in Syria, Russia has probably the most to gain. Throughout the Syrian civil war, Russia has staunchly supported the Assad regime. During the weekend, the New York Times revealed that the Russian Air Force deliberately and repeatedly bombed Syrian hospitals in rebel-held areas, indicating how far Russia is willing to go to support Assad.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut apart from military force, Russian President Vladimir Putin has also pushed ahead with diplomatic initiatives, positioning him at the center of the Syrian morass. The U.S. pullout expands the Russian leverage in at least two ways.\n\nFirstly, the strengthening of the Assad regime would inevitably also bolster Russia, a key backer.\n\nBut ironically, it could also help to deepen Moscow\u2019s ties to the country Assad\u2019s forces may now face off in northern Syria: Turkey. With the United States potentially poised to impose sanctions on Turkey, as Trump indicated Monday, Russia\u2019s rapprochement with Turkey could speed up \u2014 despite the countries\u2019 differing interests in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nFrom Russia\u2019s perspective, this apparent contradiction may not seem so contradictory at all. In the past, Moscow has argued that SDF fighters should yield control to the Assad regime. The Turkish incursion and U.S. pullout may lead to exactly such a scenario, as Sunday\u2019s deal between the SDF and the Assad regime appeared to suggest.\n\nAD\n\nThe developments of the past week may also be an opportunity for Iran, another backer of the Assad regime. The U.S. pullout, said Brookings researcher Fathollah-Nejad, \u201cwill expand Iran\u2019s opportunities to engage with Kurds and portray itself as the only reliable partner.\u201d This could help Tehran restrict the Kurds\u2019 drive for empowerment, which Iran opposes.\n\nBut Fathollah-Nejad cautioned that Russia\u2019s and Iran\u2019s interests in Syria were not necessarily aligned and that the Turkish incursion may still end up becoming a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for Iran, which explains why Iranian officials have officially condemned the Turkish offensive.\n\nAD\n\nIranian officials may fear a radicalization of Kurdish separatism, said Fathollah-Nejad, and a full-blown resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nHow does Islamic State gain?\n\nAmid the backlash against his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, Trump went on the offensive last week and blamed European countries for what he suggested was a lack of willingness to take back Islamic State fighters born in Europe and held by the Syrian Kurds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost,\u201d Trump reiterated on Monday.\n\nEuropean officials have rejected Trump\u2019s criticism, arguing that Islamic State returnees would in many cases walk free in Europe, as authorities often lack evidence for crimes committed in Syria or Iraq. Despite fierce criticism from human rights advocates, major European governments have opted to leave Islamic State fighters in Kurdish detention.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. pullout has resulted in an outcome detrimental both to U.S. counterterrorism officials and their European counterparts. Some 785 people affiliated with the Islamic State escaped from a camp on Sunday, according to Kurdish officials.\n\nApart from the escape of former Islamic State fighters or supporters, European officials worry the chaos of renewed widespread military conflict in that part of Syria could provide the Islamic State group with an opening to conduct new attacks and rebuild its organization.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the U.S. has shot itself into the foot,\u201d one analyst said.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F-HGGmeY5KgK9L4PH1SduV9U5Dw=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-10-2019/t_f30c53bdd42c419d8576122b66050ad4_name_1920_syria_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
