REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/File Photo\n\n\u201cIn just five hours, the area was completely flooded, with no prior notice, so people could only save themselves,\u201d Fathalrahman said, as the 27-year-old engineer recovered bed frames and school books from abandoned homes.\n\nThe flooding that has killed scores of people and destroyed more than 100,000 homes is the first crisis to test Sudan\u2019s new prime minister, the African country\u2019s first civilian leader in 30 years.\n\nPrime Minister Abdalla Hamdok\u2019s August 21 inauguration raised hopes that the new civilian-led government would mean a fresh approach, including being more responsive to the needs of the Sudanese people.\n\nBut Hamdok is hamstrung by an economy crippled by debt and a legacy of under investment in infrastructure that has exacerbated the flood crisis.\n\nThe communities hit by the floods, which started in July, have been mostly left to fend for themselves or rely on aid with little help from authorities, just as they did under the previous regime, according to residents, community groups and charity workers.\n\n\u201cThe civilian government is right now an abstract notion,\u201d said Magdi El Gizouli, a Sudanese academic based in Germany and fellow of the Rift Valley Institute, a non-profit research organization. \u201cIt will emerge eventually but whether it can exercise power is a totally different story.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office and the military declined to comment on the flood response.\n\nThe flood crisis comes at a time of huge transition for Sudan, as months of protests ushered in a transitional government that must also tackle a full-blown economic crisis and internal conflicts, issues that helped bring down the three-decade rule of Omar al-Bashir.\n\nHamdok\u2019s cabinet was sworn in on Sunday; civilian state governors are yet to be appointed.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters days after his inauguration, Hamdok said the flood situation required \u201cimmediate and strategic intervention\u201d and that \u201cthe government must put in place solutions and plans to ensure that the harm to citizens from floods and rains does not repeat.\u201d\n\nHe has announced the formation of a task force to focus on the flood-relief effort and said Sudan should follow the lead of other countries by building damns, channels and other ways to make use of the water.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE VOID\n\nDuring a visit to Wad Ramli in late August, Hamdok was interrupted by chants from residents demanding that they be resettled to avoid a repeat of situation in the future.\n\n\u201cI hear you very well,\u201d he responded. \u201cTogether we will execute this resettlement plan. You have to help us with suggestions.\u201d\n\nUnder the power-sharing arrangement between the military council and the main opposition coalition, Hamdok will head a transitional government for just over three years, until an election.\n\nBut the formation of the government, which was supposed to be in place by the end of last month, was repeatedly delayed due to political wrangling over cabinet appointments as well as months of negotiations between the military and the main opposition coalition.\n\nHamdok has apologized for the delay.\n\nThat has left a void for the country\u2019s most powerful paramilitary group, the large and well-financed Rapid Support Forces (RSF), to fill in terms of the flood response, said academic Gizouli.\n\nRSF commander General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is known as Hemedti, is seen by analysts as the most powerful member of the newly-established sovereign council, the joint military-civilian body that oversees to the prime minister and the cabinet. The RSF has also been accused by protesters and rights groups of involvement in killing demonstrators, something Hemedti has previously denied.\n\nThe military has supplied some flood assistance, including mattresses and tents, according to state media and residents.\n\nNEIGHBOURHOOD GROUPS\n\nHelp has instead come from charities and international organizations like the United Nations, including medical supplies and transport, according to residents and the organizations. Gulf countries including Kuwait and Qatar have also provided assistance.\n\nKhartoum-based charity Nafeer has provided tents, mosquito nets, food, toiletries, and construction equipment to flood hit areas across the country, according to Ghazi Elrayah, a volunteer with the charity who focuses on external communication.\n\nThe response from the authorities has been \u201cvery weak. It hasn\u2019t really changed this year,\u201d said Elrayah. \u201cWe do the emergency relief for this country. What we are doing is not a permanent solution,\u201d Elrayah added.\n\nJoining the flood-relief effort across Khartoum are what are known as neighbourhood resistance committees that had previously focused on mobilizing communities to join the anti-Bashir protests that led to his ouster.\n\nThe committees are helping distribute supplies they have received largely through donations, and are working with groups like Nafeer, which has provided equipment to dig ditches.\n\nThat includes neighbourhoods in the region known as Khartoum\u2019s \u201csouthern belt\u201d that have been particularly hard hit because of the large number of slums, which are easily demolished by the floods.\n\nA member of one of the committees there, who wished to be identified only by his last name Osman due to security concerns, said the committee had approached local authorities, hoping for supplies and equipment to help dig ditches.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get anything from them. Nothing, no aid,\u201d Osman said. He added that the committees are now focusing on battling waterborne illnesses like malaria, which are spreading as a result of the flooding.\n\nMohamed Ali Alshareef, general manager for the Jebel Awlia local authority that includes the southern belt, said the authority provided some tents, pesticides and drainage services but that the political changes had impacted its finances.\n\n\u201cThe situation was above our capacity,\u201d he said.", "description": "In Wad Ramli, a village outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, Alsamani Fathalrahman and his neighbours travelled in blue speedboats through flooded streets trying to salvage their belongings.", "authors": ["Eltayeb Siddig", "Nafisa Eltahir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428279254&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890S9-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
