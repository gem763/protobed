The play would have been a touchdown if completed, something Keenum knew. \u201cI totally missed him,\u201d Keenum said after the game.\n\nThe mistake was one of the few that could be solely blamed on Keenum through the first two games. The 31-year-old has performed well generally, but moving forward, Keenum has to be better aware of seeing the whole field.\n\nHe knows it, too.\n\n\u201cMy eyes have to be in the right place,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI have to go through my progressions when I have and I\u2019ve got put the ball in the right place. There are a few times and overall, you can be good, but there\u2019s two or three plays that can make a difference in the ball game.\u201d\n\nKeenum acknowledged that not seeing every receiver on each play is \u201cgoing to happen.\u201d But there are ways he can improve his decision-making process. In his first year of Jay Gruden\u2019s offense, Keenum said he can do that by understanding what coaches want from him on every play.\n\nTwo things to note here for Case Keenum;\n\n\n\n#1 - he threw it RIGHT to the defender (who dropped it)\n\n\n\n#2 - Paul Richardson was WIDE open deep. #Redskins pic.twitter.com/9bLnTt7Gvj \u2014 Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) September 15, 2019\n\nRecognizing defenses, he said, also helps speed up his progressions. If he knows how each defense is trying to attack ahead of time, Keenum said he can work through each route even faster.\n\nAgainst the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys, Keenum threw for a combined 601 yards and five touchdowns \u2014 all while avoiding throwing an interception. Keenum\u2019s performance has quieted the demand for rookie Dwayne Haskins to play and Washington is fifth in passing efficiency, according to Football Outsiders.\n\nBut there\u2019s room for improvement and Keenum faces another tough defense Monday in the Chicago Bears (1-1).\n\nDespite two straight losses, Keenum urged the \u201csky is not falling\u201d for the Redskins.\n\n\u201cNone of us want to be 0-2, but it is a long season,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI\u2019ve started a lot of seasons 2-0, 3-1 and may have a total of fix or six games after that \u2014 between the two seasons. So I\u2019d rather win 10 of my next 14 than the other way around and start hot and finish cold. It\u2019s a long season and we have to play some good football teams and we\u2019re getting better every week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of different things coming together and I think we\u2019ll be where we want to be come late in the season.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
