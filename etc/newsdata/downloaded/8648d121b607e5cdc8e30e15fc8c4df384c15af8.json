She never treated me nicely,\u201d Trump said, per a pool report. \u201cBut I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional and I respect professionals. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.\u201d\n\nPer pool, here's Trump on the death of Cokie Roberts: \u201cI never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional and I respect professionals...Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 17, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s comments were in stark contrast to the tributes paid by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe Bush family described Roberts as \u201ca talented, tough, and fair reporter\u201d who \u201cbecame a friend.\u201d Obama called her \u201ca trailblazing figure; a role model to young women at a time when the profession was still dominated by men.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper noted how Roberts grilled Trump over the telephone about the effects of his divisive rhetoric ahead of the 2016 election:\n\nHere\u2019s Cokie in 2016 asking then-candidate Trump about reports of white kids in the US using his rhetoric and campaign promises to tease and harass minority kids. https://t.co/pXd91LPbNK \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 17, 2019\n\nOthers called the president\u2019s response to her death \u201ccrass\u201d and \u201cunreal\u201d and accused Trump of making Roberts\u2019 death all about himself:\n\nI don't even know what to say about this https://t.co/GqWlbv7UNP \u2014 Laura Lorson (@prairielaura) September 17, 2019\n\nWe need to amend the Constitution to include making sure the President is a human being. https://t.co/RHrHOfBXZ1 \u2014 Phil Plait (@BadAstronomer) September 17, 2019\n\nEvery Trump anecdote is the generic New Yorker cartoon with the caption \"Christ, what an asshole.\" https://t.co/qp31Kn4OcA \u2014 Emily Nussbaum (@emilynussbaum) September 17, 2019\n\nBecause Cokie was a person of character, she didn\u2019t have a high opinion of Donald Trump. But because she was a shrewd political observer, she often said during the 2016 campaign that we shouldn\u2019t underestimate his chances of victory. https://t.co/jXcrIVPVgM \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) September 17, 2019\n\nHe is unable to expression compassion toward another human being.\n\n\n\nExcept his beloved Dear Leaders Putin and KJU.#BlueWave2020 https://t.co/H9CxqJsYNA \u2014 Ethan Bearman (@EthanBearman) September 17, 2019\n\nOn the passing of NPR's Cokie Roberts...\n\nBarack Obama: \"A trailblazing figure.\"\n\nBill Clinton: \"An institution.\"\n\nGeorge W.

Singer (@CahnEmily) September 17, 2019\n\nOh, well. I was going to say that, based on what I'd seen on Twitter, Cokie Roberts might be the last departed journalist to get universal praise across the political spectrum. Of course, there's one out-liar. https://t.co/NLWURaxiHL \u2014 Robert A George (@RobGeorge) September 17, 2019\n\nNo class. Not even for a moment. https://t.co/qlTOg9C1DE \u2014 David Corn (@DavidCornDC) September 17, 2019\n\nUnbelievable. https://t.co/gwWeldc6vz \u2014 G O L D I E.

And she probably was honest about you. Did no one tell you not to speak ill of the dead - even if they are right about you? Acting with class is just not something you are capable of is it? Crass, crass, crass, ..ass. \u2014 Janet Schulz (@LadyRoryBlack) September 18, 2019\n\nNot everything is about you, Trump. https://t.co/6QhKJUkHqU \u2014 Feisty Ginger (@mchastain81) September 17, 2019\n\nIt always comes back to him. https://t.co/CSLlxpPZGU \u2014 Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) September 17, 2019", "description": "\"No class.
