But with its straw-man messaging, Planned Parenthood and its celebrity PR team are only preaching to their choir. They\u2019re not converting anyone.\n\nOn August 26, Planned Parenthood announced that it had collected the signatures of nearly 140 musicians as part of its latest campaign for abortion called \u201cBans Off My Body.\u201d To boast about its supporters, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider purchased an ad listing the artists \u2013 from Lady Gaga to Ariana Grande \u2013 in Billboard magazine.\n\nPlanned Parenthood began its campaign in June in response to state bans on abortion. Leana Wen, then the president of Planned Parenthood, declared that Americans want \u201cbodily autonomy\u201d instead of \u201cbans on abortion care.\u201d\n\nAs Planned Parenthood\u2019s current, acting president, Alexis McGill Johnson told Billboard in August that, in particular, \"Artists can highlight how out-of-touch some of our politicians are in this space.\u201d\n\nOr, perhaps, they can highlight how out of touch both they and Planned Parenthood are with the rest of America. Poll after poll reveals that the majority of Americans want abortion restrictions, including, more recently, a June NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nThat\u2019s because, as the pro-life movement stresses, every pregnancy involves two bodies: a mother and her unborn baby. In other words, abortion restrictions don\u2019t place bans on bodies. They save them.\n\nPlanned Parenthood isn\u2019t addressing arguments like those in its media ads, a new tactic for the abortion provider. In June, Planned Parenthood also helped organize signatures from CEOs and company executives for an ad supporting abortion in the New York Times. But using celebrity support is an old Planned Parenthood tactic.\n\n\u201cBans Off My Body\u201d uses dozens of celebrities \u2013 136 musicians, to be exact \u2013 to promote abortion. And many of them, like Miley Cyrus, have backed Planned Parenthood before.\n\nNot only did the musicians sign a petition against abortion restrictions, but also some will invite Planned Parenthood to \u201ccall fans to action at music festivals like Jay-Z's Made in America in Philadelphia and Music Midtown in Atlanta,\u201d Billboard reported. \u201cThe nonprofit will also have a presence on a number of artists' national tours this year.\u201d\n\nWith its celebrity endorsements, Planned Parenthood hopes to attract half a million signatures for its petition by Jan. 22, 2020 \u2013 a date that marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States.\n\n\u201cMusicians across the country are standing in solidarity,\u201d Planned Parenthood declared on its webpage. \u201cThey\u2019re saying access to sexual and reproductive health care is about the same type of freedom that allows them to create music and speak their truth \u2014 because no one is free unless they control their own body.\u201d\n\nAnd an unborn baby\u2019s body, it would seem.\n\nPlanned Parenthood then listed the musicians in agreement, including big-name artists like Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepsen, Demi Lovato, Dua Lipa, Halsey, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Meghan Trainor, Miley Cyrus, and Nicki Minaj.\n\nSome of them, like Dua Lipa, took to social media to urge their followers to join them in signing Planned Parenthood\u2019s petition.\n\n\u201c25 MILLION. That\u2019s how many women live in a state where abortion could be outlawed if Roe is overturned,\u201d the artist tweeted August 24. \u201cJoin me & Planned Parenthood and tell politicians: get your #BansOffMyBody.\u201d\n\nOther female singers who supported Planned Parenthood included Alanis Morissette, Billie Eilish, Fiona Apple, Idina Menzel, Kacey Musgraves, Norah Jones, Sara Bareilles, Sarah McLachlan, Sia, and Tove Lo. Male artists who signed the petition included John Legend, Macklemore, T-Pain, and Troye Sivan.\n\nLike Dua Lipa, Norah Jones tweeted on August 26: \u201cToday, over 130 musicians and artists are standing with Planned Parenthood. Join Norah, @ArianaGrande, @kaceymusgraves, @billieeilish, @NICKIMINAJ and more now.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Tove Lo tweeted, \u201cOur bodies are our own. If they are not, we can not be truly free. Or equal.\u201d\n\nAnd, in a statement released by Planned Parenthood, Eilish similarly added that \"Every person deserves the right to control their body, their life, and their future.\"\n\nPro-lifers would agree. Except for that, they would urge, a person\u2019s body, life, and future begin in the womb.\n\nThe remaining stars in support of Planned Parenthood are:\n\nThe 1975\n\nAdia Victoria\n\nAlina Baraz\n\nAmanda Palmer\n\nAmara La Negra\n\nAmy Millan (of Stars)\n\nAndra Day\n\nA$AP Ferg\n\nAshanti\n\nBad Bad Hats\n\nBand of Horses\n\nBeck\n\nBest Coast\n\nBETTY\n\nBetty Who\n\nThe Bird and The Bee\n\nBleached\n\nBob Mould\n\nBon Iver\n\nCarole King\n\nCharlie Burg\n\nCharlotte Lawrence\n\nChina Forbes (of Pink Martini)\n\nChloe Flower\n\nCHVRCHES\n\nCindy Wilson (of The B-52s)\n\nCynthia Erivo\n\nDan Deacon\n\nDana Williams\n\nDaya\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie\n\nThe Distillers\n\nDonna Missal\n\nEmily Wolfe\n\nErin Rae\n\nEvie Irie\n\nFetty Wap\n\nThe Midnight\n\nFirst Aid Kit\n\nFoo Fighters\n\nFred Schneider (of The B-52s)\n\nG-Eazy\n\nGilligan Moss\n\nGrace Sewell\n\nGrace VanderWaal\n\nGrace Weber\n\nGrouplove\n\nHAIM\n\nHayley Kiyoko\n\nHeart\n\nHeidi Rodewald (of Passing Strange)\n\nHinds\n\nHippo Campus\n\nIngrid Michaelson\n\niyla\n\nJarina De Marco\n\nJenny Lewis\n\nJosh Ritter\n\nJustine Skye\n\nK.
