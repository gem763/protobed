[John Bolton] is free right now,\" Information and Communications Technology minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi said on Twitter.\n\nBolton's 17-month tenure in the Trump administration came to an halt on Tuesday after numerous reports of deepening policy divides between himself and the president. Bolton's combative views on striking a peace deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan conflicted with that of Trump, who recently suggested brokering a now-defunct agreement with the terrorist group at Camp David.\n\nOne source of Trump's ire was his belief that Bolton or his team had leaked details of a discussion in which Trump suggested lessening a hurricane's effect by using nuclear weapons, according to CBS News.\n\nBolton, an architect of the Iraq war, is known for his hawkish views \u2014 including those towards Iran. His stated \"goal\" for complete regime change in Iran has incensed Iranian officials.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in an April interview with Fox News, accused Bolton of \"dragging the United States into a conflict.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that President Trump wants to do that, I believe President Trump ran on a campaign promise of not bringing the United States into another war,\" Zarif said.\n\nBolton's reputation as an Iranian hawk was noted by Jahromi, who previously mocked him with spliced footage of HBO's \"Chernobyl\" miniseries and a White House press gaggle amid heightened tensions after the US downed an Iranian drone in July. US Marines jammed and downed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, an act which Trump characterized as a \"defensive action.\"\n\nIran denied that one of their drones was destroyed.", "description": "\"Need a mustache fashion Designer?
