It's true. It's a compliment but don't aim to do what I do, aim to do better.\n\n'I'm happy we (women) are getting positive things because it's been like 'what's it like to be...?' They are valid questions but it's always with a negative slant and you're like 'we're just doing our jobs'.\n\n'We're training just as hard and going out there and winning medals.\n\n'From what I've seen it's getting better but with the Olympics, Women's World Cup in the past few years we've definitely seen a trend in people (women) wanting to play sport and knowing about it in popular culture, magazines.'", "description": "The BBC has secured broadcast rights to the 2021 and 2023 World Athletics Championships, it announced on Sunday evening after the conclusion of the 2019 event in Doha.", "authors": ["Press Association Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/23/19373702-0-image-a-53_1570400799554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
