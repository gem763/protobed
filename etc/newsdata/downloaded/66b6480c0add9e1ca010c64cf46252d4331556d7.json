He doesn't want anyone to know where he is or what he's doing.'\n\nMichael Guider's current home is the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program Centre in Sydney's Long Bay prison complex, near where he was until recently imprisoned.\n\nTim Guider believes his brother is using his time at Nunyara to prepare himself for a time when he can commit sex crimes against children again.\n\nHe predicts Guider will drastically alter his appearance before he leaves Nunyara, including removing the long grey beard he grew this year.\n\n'He grew a kind of a bikie beard, so he could walk out looking mean,' Tim Guider said. 'That'll go and then people won't recognise him.'\n\n'He's going to make himself look like Mr Average. They don't want people to recognise him in the community because people will want to kill him.'\n\nChild killer Michael Guider has cut off all contact with the outside world as he stays holed-up in a halfway house six weeks after his release from prison. He is pictured carrying two bags of belongings as he left Long Bay's Metropolitan Special Programs Centre on September 5\n\nMichael Guider is being housed at the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program Centre in Sydney's Long Bay prison complex. Nunyara is a non-custodial facility providing interim accommodation for up to 36 recently released medium to high-risk male offenders\n\nMichael Guider kidnapped, drugged and killed nine-year-old school girl Samantha Knight in 1986. She was snatched from near her home at Bondi and her remains have never been found\n\nMr Guider said his brother wanted to cut himself off from the outside world 'so that he can operate again as a paedophile.'\n\n'He is worse than he was 20 years ago, not better,' he said. 'Imagine what lengths he'll go to now.'\n\nWhen Guider was filmed leaving prison on September 5 his most distinctive features were the beard and a basketball-size hernia hanging from underneath his shirt which caused him to waddle when he walked.\n\nTim Guider believed his brother would ensure that unsightly growth was also removed before he left the halfway house and would try to keep that secret too.\n\nUnder the terms of his release Guider must seek permission to 'significantly' change his appearance but his brother said the public would not be alerted if he did.\n\n'He could shave his beard off and say, \"Whoops!\" What are they gonna say? He could shave the whole thing off and there's nothing they can do about it.'\n\nGuider, who turned 69 on Sunday, was let go from the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre after serving 17 years for Samantha Knight's manslaughter.\n\nSamantha's body has never been found and Guider has shown no remorse for killing her, which he once claimed was accidental.\n\nGuider had previously been jailed for sexually assaulting 13 children from 1980 to 1996 and police are aware of other victims still too traumatised to come forward.\n\nTim Guider (pictured) predicts his brother will drastically alter his appearance before he leaves the halfway house he is staying in, including removing the long beard he grew this year. 'That'll go and then people won't recognise him. He's going to make himself look like Mr Average'\n\nGuider's fellow Nunyara residents are an unsavoury bunch but he will be the most high-profile occupant until some church or charity can be convinced to take him in. Finding a permanent home for the child molester may prove difficult. He is pictured leaving prison on September 5\n\nHis brother believed Michael, who his on strict parole conditions, would find a way to return to his old ways once he was back in the community.\n\n'He's a hunter,' Tim Guider said. 'And that's what I think he'll do. He'll start out hunting.\n\n'But he won\u2019t be limping around or hunched over or looking surly. He'll just walk around normally and he'll talk to people. He's a friendly, outgoing sort of guy.\n\n'He'll start to look for victims because honestly he can't help himself. Not because he's got some disease or something like that.\n\n'He can't help himself because he hasn't dealt with it. He hasn't come to terms with it.\n\n'He hasn't said \"I've got this really bad problem and I'm going to get it off my chest now, get it out in the open and tell the truth about Samantha and everything.\"\n\n'He's not doing any of that. He's not telling us anything. Because he wants to keep doing it.'\n\n'He's still a paedophile. He's not rehabilitated at all - not one little bit - and he won't be until he fesses up and gets it out.'\n\nSerial paedophile Michael Guider is holed-up in a secure facility surrounded by other sex offenders who cannot be safely placed in the community. His new home is a single room featuring a bed and a deskat the Nunyara facility (pictured) in the Long Bay prison complex\n\nA Corrective Services NSW spokeswoman said that until a place was found for Guider he would only leave Nunyara when escorted by staff to essential appointments. In the meantime he would be helped into adapting to life outside prison, where Guider has spent the past 23 years\n\nMr Guider believed it was unhealthy for his brother not to be in contact with him.\n\n'I'm flabbergasted that the people in charge of him cannot see the value in him being able to communicate with his brother,' he said. 'That is beyond me.\n\n'The first thing they should have done is talk to me. I'm all about finding Samantha and rehabilitating Michael but they don't seem to be.\n\n'I want him to stop being a paedophile, nothing more. And I'm sure he can if he tries hard but he's not even f***ing trying.\n\n'He's not doing it and he's not doing it because he has every intention of continuing. This guy is a danger. He's very much a danger and now it's become more complicated.'\n\nMr Guider said he had spoken with the management team responsible for his brother and was told they could provide no information about his circumstances.\n\n'I asked them, \"Did you tell him that I've called\" and they said, \"Yeah, we did, and he doesn't want any contact with anybody including you.\" And that was that.'\n\nMichael Guider has no other family and his brother said there was no one else from his past likely to contact him. 'Everybody's offside with him,' he said.\n\n'He's going to be completely on his own now, a complete loner. And everyone will be out for him.'\n\nFinding a permanent home for a sex monster who drugged and molested perhaps scores of children in the 1980s and 1990s and is still considered a high risk of re-offending is proving difficult.\n\nUntil a suitable place for Guider can be found he will stay at Nunyara.\n\nNunyara (pictured) helps offenders build life skills by requiring them to cook, clean, budget, perform grounds maintenance and seek long-term employment and accommodation. Offenders receive supervision, support and case management while residing there\n\nNunyara is an indigenous word meaning 'restored to health' and the facility is part of Corrective Services NSW's Community Offender Support Program.\n\nIt is a 'non-custodial community-based service' providing interim accommodation to medium to high-risk offenders and houses up to 36 men under supervision.\n\nWhile some of Guider's fellow boarders can leave Nunyara during daylight hours, he is confined to the centre until suitable accommodation can be found for him elsewhere.\n\nNot all the parolees in Nunyara, which opened in 2008, are sex offenders but they are all men who have nowhere else to go after being released from prison.\n\nThat could be due to a lack of family and other support networks or even simply because of a short supply of boarding house rooms.\n\nRecently released child sex offenders are considered even harder to place in outside accommodation than murderers.\n\nMichael Guider is pictured left at Long Bay jail while visiting his bank robber brother Tim on Christmas Day, 1986, four months after he killed Samantha. He is pictured right clutching a Kodak film packet and developed photographs in 1984, the year he began molesting Samantha\n\nA paedophilic pariah such as Guider would attract media attention which was unwanted by the residents and operators of even church or charity-run housing.\n\nA Corrective Services NSW spokeswoman said that until a suitable place was found for Guider he could only leave Nunyara when escorted by staff to essential appointments.\n\nIn the meantime he would be encouraged to adapt to life outside prison, where Guider had spent the past 23 years.\n\nGuider's freedom is subject to 56 strict court-imposed conditions overseen by a Corrective Services department supervising officer (DSO) for the next five years.\n\nSome of these conditions are broad: 'The defendant must follow all reasonable directions by his DSO or any other person supervising him.'\n\nSome are specific: He cannot purchase, possess, access, obtain, view, participate in or listen to pornographic material classified X18+, R18+, Restricted Category 2 or Restricted Category 1.\n\nGuider was released from the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre after serving 17 years for Samantha Knight's manslaughter and moved to the nearby Nunyara Community Offender Support Program centre, which is also part of the Long Bay prison complex (pictured)\n\nGuider must wear an electronic monitoring device and provide a weekly plan called a 'schedule of movements' three days before it is due to start.\n\nHe must not deviate from his schedule of movements except in an emergency or if there is a 'reasonable explanation' provided no later than 24 hours after that change.\n\nHe must always truthfully answer questions from his DSO or any other person supervising him about where he is, where he is going and what he is doing.\n\nGuider\u2019s next address \u2013 and any address thereafter for the next five years \u2013 must be approved by his DSO.\n\nNo other person can enter and remain, or stay overnight, at his approved address without the DSO's prior approval.\n\nHe cannot go to any of the following places without approval from his DSO: day care centres, pre-schools and schools, amusement parlours, amusement parks and theme parks, cinemas, libraries and museums.\n\nHe cannot enter camping grounds and caravan parks, children's playgrounds, parks and any areas with play equipment provided for children.\n\nGuider claimed he had killed nine-year-old Samantha Knight (pictured) accidentally after he kidnapped the nine-year-old from near her Bondi home. Samantha's body has not been found\n\nHe cannot go to pools, playing fields and sporting facilities, concerts, theatre shows, movies, events and activities intended for the entertainment of children.\n\nAnd he cannot visit any residence where he knows that someone aged under 18 ordinarily lives.\n\nPlaces used solely or mainly for the sale or display of sexually explicit material, or for providing sexual services or sexually explicit entertainment are also out of bounds.\n\nMichael Guider, 68, served 17 years for the manslaughter of schoolgirl Samantha Knight\n\nEven after he leaves Nunyara Guider must not possess or use alcohol or illegal drugs and submit to testing for both.\n\nHe cannot enter any licensed premises including hotels, bars and clubs - but excluding cafes and restaurants - without approval.\n\nGuider must not approach or have contact with anyone he knows or 'reasonably should know' is under 18, other than 'incidental contact in a public place' unless he is in the company of an approved person.\n\nThe DSO can notify anyone Guider associates with who has children in their care of his criminal history and can stop him from seeing anyone he or she tells him not to.\n\nIf Guider wants to see a sex worker that can only be done with the approval of the DSO, who also must be told if he starts a romantic relationship.\n\nHe will need permission to join any club or organisation and any social media network.\n\nHe cannot change his name from Michael Anthony Guider \u2013 which Daily Mail Australia has previously revealed might not be his real name - without approval.", "description": "Serial paedophile Michael Guider, who kidnapped and killed nine-year-old Samantha Knight in 1986, has refused to receive letters, phone calls or visits from anyone since his release from prison.", "authors": ["Stephen Gibbs For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/03/19818230-0-image-a-16_1571280867174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
