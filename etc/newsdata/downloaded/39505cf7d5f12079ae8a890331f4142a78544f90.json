In balloting conducted by The Associated Press, 68 media members on a nationwide panel voted for their top 100.\n\nAmong those disclosed, the range goes from Steve Van Buren\u2019s touchdown in the snow in 1948 (No. 91) to Hugh McElhenny\u2019s catch and run without a helmet in 1952 (No. 92) to the brutal hit applied by Chuck Bednarik on Frank Gifford in 1960 (No. 44) to Jim Marshall\u2019s wrong-way run in 1964 (No. 54).\n\nPost-merger, the list features everything from John Elway\u2019s helicopter spin in the Super Bowl after the 1997 season (No. 33) to Dan Marino\u2019s fake spike (No. 38) in 1995. It also includes Mario Manningham\u2019s clutch reception to spark the Giants\u2019 comeback to beat the Patriots in the title game for the 2011 season and Deion Sanders\u2019 punt return for a TD the first time he touches the ball for Atlanta in 1989, which Sanders describes in detail.\n\n\u201cSo I make it down to Atlanta, had a couple days of practice,\u201d Sanders recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t start, but they knew punt returning is instinctive, so you got to start me returning punts. So I had a small chat with the punt return team: \u2018Hey guys, just block seven. I got four, all right?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut things didn\u2019t go perfectly.\n\n\u201cThey kicked it and I dropped it,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cI took my eyes off it and I dropped it, and when I dropped it, that was the best thing that happened. Because when you drop a ball, the punt team tends to migrate together, get out of their lanes, and they all came tight. All I had to do was making it to that corner and hit it. And when I hit it, I hit.\u201d\n\nThe eclectic list ranges from the very old to the very new: outstanding recent plays such as Aaron Rodgers\u2019 Hail Mary to beat Detroit in 2015 (No. 52) to Derrick Henry\u2019s 99-yard run (No. 89) and the Miami Miracle (No. 42) last year made the cut.\n\n\u201cUntil I got in the end zone, I mean honestly, I\u2019m sitting before you all and I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Kenyan Drake said during interviews after the improbable conclusion to a 34-33 win over New England. Drake finished off a 69-yard reception-and-lateral marvel that some have dubbed \u201cThe Drake Escape.\u201d\n\nDozens of Hall of Famers are highlighted, as well. Along with Van Buren and Bednarik, Elway and Marino and Sanders, how about Gale Sayers\u2019 85-yard punt return in 1965 (No. 34), followed one spot later by Tony Dorsett\u2019s 99-yard touchdown sprint in 1983?\n\nWalter Payton\u2019s 1977 run through the Chiefs is 37th, with another Canton-inductee running back, Earl Campbell\u2019s 1978 power rush against the Rams at No. 39.\n\nDon\u2019t think sensational defensive plays were ignored.\n\nTracy Porter\u2019s pick-6 against Peyton Manning that clinched the Saints\u2019 only Super Bowl win in February 2010 is 32nd. Denver\u2019s Jeremiah Castille stripping Cleveland\u2019s Earnest Byner to cause \u201cThe Fumble\u201d in the 1987 AFC title game came in 49th.\n\nThe top 30 will be announced next Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "What a play.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/nfl_at_100_greatest_plays_football_98569_c0-271-5173-3287_s1770x1032.jpg?c68eed6e16a78febad248ba5e0c883eaf0596352", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
