Just 24 percent said the budget should be balanced mostly by increasing revenue.\n\nIn general, Democrats favor a much greater emphasis on tax revenue than do Republicans, most of whom are adamantly opposed to any increased taxes at all.\n\nNotably, many respondents who identified themselves as Democrats actually supported key Republican proposals, according to The Hill poll. Just 44 percent of Democrats said budget deficits should be reduced mostly by raising taxes, while slightly fewer, 40 percent, said balance should be achieved mostly by reining in spending.\n\nBy contrast, a strong majority of Republicans toed the party line. Eighty-eight percent, said deficits should be reduced by cutting spending, while just 7 percent said the budget should be balanced by increasing revenue.\n\nHowever, as soon as respondents heard the words \u201cRepublican\u201d and \u201cDemocrat,\u201d the picture changed drastically. A plurality of voters, 35 percent, said they trust the Democrats more on budgetary issues, while 30 percent said they trust the Republicans more. A full 34 percent said they trust neither party.\n\nThese findings buttress the impression that the Republican label itself incites mistrust among many voters.\n\nSince the 2012 election, which saw GOP losses in Congress as well as President Obama\u2019s reelection, the party has become increasingly divided over how to restore its tarnished reputation.\n\nSpeeches by two rising stars to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week reflected the party\u2019s identity crisis.

The GOP budget put forth by Ryan assumes that most of the healthcare reform law should be repealed.\n\nNotably, a plurality of respondents in The Hill poll agreed with Ryan\u2019s assumption: Forty-five percent of voters said ObamaCare should be fully repealed, while just 37 percent said the law should be fully implemented.\n\nThe findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 14 by Pulse Opinion Research.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.", "description": "More voters trust the Democrats than GOP on budgetary issues, even though a strong majority actually prefer Republican fiscal policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2013-03-18"}
