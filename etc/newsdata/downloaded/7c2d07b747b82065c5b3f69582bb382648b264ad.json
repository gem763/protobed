The average loan size for owner-occupier borrowers rose to its highest-ever seasonally adjusted level of $414,007, said BIS Oxford Economics economist Maree Kilroy.\n\n\"This shows that not only are more people able to borrow for a house, but also that the amount they can borrow has increased,\" said Ms Kilroy.\n\nGrowth of owner-occupier loans slowed to 1.9 per cent in August from July's 5.4-per-cent jump, with all of the gain coming from first-home buyers.\n\nTotal new owner-occupier loans rose 0.7 per cent to 32,740, weaker than the consensus estimate of a 2.3-per-cent gain. Loan volumes were dragged down by a 0.7-per-cent decline in the number of loans to non-first-home buyers. Loans to first-time buyers, by contrast, jumped 5.2 per cent to 9869.\n\n\"These data will provide further evidence to the RBA that rate cuts are being transmitted to the broader economy via the traditional channels, further aiding the narrative of a gentle turning point in the economy in the second half of 2019,\" said JP Morgan economist Sally Auld.\n\nBut while the stronger housing-related activity would not prevent further rate cuts, the knock-on effect of additional possible reductions in the benchmark cash rate may be less, said Ms Auld.\n\n\"With headline lending rates no longer falling in line with the reduction in the overnight cash rate, this effect is likely to be more muted going forward,\" she said.\n\nTotal new home loans, excluding refinancing of existing loans, rose 2.9 per cent to $18.4 billion. While this was still 5 per cent below the $19.4 billion worth of new loan commitments made in August last year, the year-on-year rate of decline is slowing.\n\nNew lending, including refinancing, rose 4.5 per cent in August to $27.9 billion. This was the highest monthly total since October last year.", "description": "Investor home loans grew at their fastest pace in almost three years and first-home buyers roared into action in August, as rising prices and easier borrowing terms drew buyers back into the housing market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4672%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_351%2C$y_417/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aae85f4d85a4c9430217d27b94f3e69f07142b03", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
