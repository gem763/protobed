Emergency responders rushed to the scene \u2014 too late to save the eight newborns, though 11 other infants, along with 37 mothers and 28 hospital workers, were successfully evacuated from the area, authorities said.\n\nAs firefighters worked to get the blaze under control, families of the victims gathered outside the Al-Um Bashir bin Nasser Hospital to demand a government investigation, according to CNN.\n\nThe state\u2019s health minister, Mohamed Miraoui, said on television that the fire may have been started by a defective mosquito repellent device and vowed the government will launch an \u201curgent investigation\u201d to determine the exact cause, according to the AP.\n\nAgence France-Presse reported it was the second fire at the hospital in the past 16 months; \u201ca fire in May last year caused significant damage but no casualties,\u201d AFP reported.\n\nThe deadly fire comes as protests in Algeria stretch into their seventh month. At the \u201croot of citizen anger is \u2026 the failure of the country\u2019s governing system to provide for the basic needs of Algerians,\u201d a Washington Post-hosted analysis blog, The Monkey Cage, has written.\n\nAlgeria established a national health-care system in 1975, making \u201chospitalization, medicines and outpatient care\u201d free to all citizens, according to information posted by the U.S. Library of Congress.\n\nThe country\u2019s under-5 infant mortality rate is 24 per 1,000 live births, according to UNICEF. By comparison, UNICEF estimates the same statistic in the United States at 6.6 per 1,000 live births.", "description": "It was the second fire at Al-Um Bashir bin Nasser Hospital in the past 16 months.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
