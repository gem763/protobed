Some observers suggest it could even amount to a reshaping of the party itself.\n\nThe Conservatives are one of the most successful political parties in the world, at least in part because it has been a broad church of people who are economic, social, and liberal conservatives.\n\nThe expulsion of senior moderate members, including figures like Father of the House Kenneth Clarke -- who has been in politics longer than some MPs have been alive -- and Winston Churchill's grandson, Nicholas Soames, is a signal that the center of gravity in the Conservative Party is shifting.\n\nClarke said as much on the BBC\"s Newsnight program: \"Anyone who who comes up to me and tells me I'm not a Conservative is taking an odd political view. It's the Brexit Party rebadged.\"\n\nBoris Johnson delivers a speech at Downing Street on the eve of a tumultuous day in Parliament.\n\nIn carrying out the cull, Johnson blew apart his majority, presumably with the idea of replacing those members in a general election with others who will toe that line.\n\nBy calling for a snap election, he could in fact be aiming to increase his majority and strengthen his hand on Brexit all at the same time. That said, his predecessor Theresa May tried the same tactic in 2017 -- and it spectacularly blew up in her face.\n\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, says it's hard to see it going the same way this time.\n\n\"As Theresa May found in 2017, you can't necessarily make the election about what you want it to be about ... the risk is that [opposition Labour Party leader] Jeremy Corbyn manages to pull off the trick he did last time and come back from a long way behind to deny the Conservative Party a majority,\" Bale said.\n\n\"But Corbyn might not be able to pull off the same trick twice, a lot of the reason that he did well last time was because of Theresa May and the fact that she is a poor campaigner.\"\n\nLabour aside, Johnson still face risks from other factions should an election go ahead. It's almost a certainty that the party will lose many of its seats in Scotland, which it will have to make up somewhere else. And the Liberal Democrats are strong enough in areas that voted Remain in 2016 that they may well grab a few seats off the Conservatives and eat into the Tory haul. The Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage could also be in a position to pick off some Conservative votes if the UK still hasn't left the EU by the time of the vote.\n\nWho decides if there's an election?\n\nUnder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), Johnson can't just schedule an election. First, he must get the support of two-thirds of lawmakers in the House of Commons.\n\nAnd that means getting the support of the opposition Labour Party.\n\nPro-EU supporters protest outside Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has been demanding an election for months. So he would find it hard to oppose one now. But Labour is suspicious of Johnson's motives.\n\nCorbyn opposes a general election that would cross over the October 31 Brexit deadline, resulting in the UK crashing outin the runup to the vote.\n\nWhile Johnson may promise to abide by the proposed mid-October timeframe, it's within his gift to change the date at the last minute.\n\n\"Corbyn has said again and again that Labour wants a general election, 'bring it on'... but they are in a slightly awkward position,\" said Professor Tony Travers, director of the Institute of Public Affairs at the London School of Economics. \"Labour will be wary of giving Johnson an unlimited choice of running an election when it suits him.\"\n\nAnd Labour has been less than enthusiastic about the prospect of a snap election, given they're not doing very well in opinion polls, Travers added.\n\nStill, Corbyn seemed to relish having the ball in his court Tuesday, saying if the Prime Minister wanted an election, the rebel-backed bill blocking no-deal would need to be passed first.\n\n\"He wants to table a motion for a general election, fine,\" Corbyn said. \"Get the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.\"\n\nWhat if Johnson doesn't get an election?\n\nIf his election bid fails and the bill to block a no-deal is backed, Johnson will be in a bind. Would he do the one thing he has said he never would -- seek an extension to the Brexit process?\n\n\"If legislation goes through to stop a no-deal and Johnson can't figure a way to a general election, then he's in a very difficult position... he's got little choice but to go back on his word and try to make the case for a deal with the EU,\" Travers said.\n\nStill, it may not make a difference for Johnson, seemingly the ultimate Teflon politician. \"Given what's slid off him before I don't think it would be a career terminating event, especially if he has been forced to do it by parliament. If that does happen, he can fight a general election on a hard Brexit platform and have a few months in which to try a better deal with the EU... or get us back into the same spot we're in today,\" Bale said.\n\n\"It is a gamble, but then you have to think about what are the other options and they don't look that great either. It is a risk, but it is probably a risk worth taking.\"", "description": "The UK Prime Minister has detonated his parliamentary majority and pushed the House of Commons to agree an election that he has no guarantee of winning -- all to keep a nuclear no-deal Brexit option on the table.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190902210307-boris-johnson-statement-right-super-tease.jpg"}
