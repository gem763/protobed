This came after Iran in July announced it's breaching the nuclear deal's limitations on uranium stockpiling and enrichment.\n\nIran has said that these measures are reversible, and gave European powers two months to save the JCPOA and coax them back to the deal.\n\nWendy Sherman, who served as lead negotiator for the Obama administration on the JCPOA, told Insider, \"It's all concerning, because it's moving away from a framework that ensured Iran would not get a nuclear weapon, which President Trump said is the most important thing to him.\"\n\n\"Iran is not just being emboldened but is being left in some ways to take actions that say they will not be pushed back. We are at a very, very difficult place,\" Sherman added. \"All of the steps they have taken are reversible, of course, but if they do start down the road to research centrifuge technology and to test different levels of centrifuges they will gain more knowledge and that is of serious concern.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks during the cabinet meeting in Tehran, Iran, September 4, 2019. Official President website/Handout via REUTERS More\n\nReuters\n\nSherman said the discussions regarding limitations on research were a \"tough\" point during the JCPOA negotiations and an important aspect of the agreement to the Obama administration.\n\n\"If indeed they really do move forward on research they're obtaining more knowledge and you can't wipe away knowledge, which is something that President Obama understood and why he went into negotiations,\" Sherman said.\n\n\"Even if we had taken military action to bomb all of their nuclear sites, which we certainly could do, they could rebuild them and would have likely rebuilt them in secret,\" Sherman added. \"You can't bomb away knowledge, so this move is a little bit more complicated and concerning.\"\n\nTrump's maximum pressure campaign has not stopped Iran from stepping away from the JCPOA or made the Middle East more peaceful.\n\nTehran has repeatedly insisted that it doesn't want to build nuclear weapons, only nuclear power for civilian purposes.\n\nNonetheless, Iran's actions on Friday are a major act of defiance against the US and European Union, which have separately been trying \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to coax Iran back to honoring its JCPOA commitments in recent weeks.\n\nLast week Trump said he would be open to restarting talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in what looked like the first thaw between the two countries.\n\nBut Rouhani has consistently refused to talk to the US until it lifts economic sanctions \u2014 which US officials have consistently ruled out unless Iran winds down its nuclear program, which Tehran has also vowed not do to until the US removes sanctions.", "description": "Trump's maximum pressure strategy aims to cripple Iran's economy and squeeze it into a new nuclear deal, but it's showing no signs of working.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ma"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6i3ShJkxMIR8P7Gdhv3L3w--~B/aD02MDA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/cb8a102997dcad3c6d3a7d9f299a48ab", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
