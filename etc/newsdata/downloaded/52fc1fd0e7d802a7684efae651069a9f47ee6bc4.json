(Photo: WILLIAM MEYER, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\nDoubling down on both the political and business fronts, Penzeys Spices has launched an unusual promotion that as of late Tuesday afternoon had raised $435,000 for Facebook ads urging the impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n\nSince Sunday morning, the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin-based firm has been channeling all the revenue generated by new customers' online sales into the pro-impeachment drive spearheaded by chief executive Bill Penzey, who for some time has been vocal about his political views.\n\nThe effort originally was to end Monday night, but on Tuesday the company tweeted that it would continue the promotion through the day.\n\nIn dedicating the revenue to promoting the impeachment campaign on Facebook, the company will forgo profit on the sales and absorb the cost of the spices, Penzey said in an interview. The move is sure to entrench him and his company still more deeply in the country's political battlefields \u2013 terrain businesses generally try to avoid.\n\n'Pay what you owe': Your taxes are due if you filed for a federal tax extension\n\n2020 Chevrolet Corvette: It isn\u2019t just super-fast; it\u2019s luxury-car quiet and smooth\n\nPenzey, though, finds it impossible to separate his politics from his business, and believes the attention his unusual stance is attracting can ultimately boost the Penzeys brand and lead to increased sales.\n\n\u201cHow do you get to be Miller Brewing?\" Penzey asked rhetorically. \"How do you get to be Harley-Davidson? And I think that us doing our thing is us getting to be Penzey\u2019s Spices.\u201d\n\n\"Everything is a brand,\" he said. \"And how do some of them, by being who they are, become something that's sort of universal? And I think we've taken a big step in that direction the last few years.\"\n\nPenzeys drew notice last week with a report that it had spent $92,000 on a pro-impeachment Facebook post. In the wake of the reaction to the move, Penzey decided to earmark two days' worth of revenue from new online customers for further Facebook spending.\n\nThe original $92,000 Facebook ad spending on impeachment was second only to the $729,000 spent by the Trump campaign during the week of Sept. 29-Oct. 5, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive.\n\nThat was hardly the first time Bill Penzey has spent big money to broadcast his views on matters unrelated to business.\n\nBill Penzey unveiled his firm's new effort Sunday morning on Facebook, saying that the post last week had prompted more than 50,000 comments and \"eclipsed anything we had ever done.\"\n\n\"The president is trying to use Facebook to turn America against his removal from office,\" Penzey wrote. \"Together we can offset his message and maybe even overcome it.\"\n\nIn an atmosphere of entrenched partisanship, that also could cost Penzeys customers \u2013 and money. Penzey, for his part, believes the net effect will be positive for the business.\n\n\"Probably we\u2019ll pick up 1% more customers and we\u2019ll lose a half-percent,\" he said.\n\nJudging from Bill Penzey's estimates, the effort has attracted several thousand new customers. Late Monday afternoon he estimated that about 5,500 people had accounted for the $299,000 in new sales to that point.\n\nBeyond its online business, Penzeys Spices has 62 stores, according to its website.\n\nContact Rick Romell at (414) 224-2130 or rick.romell@jrn.com.
