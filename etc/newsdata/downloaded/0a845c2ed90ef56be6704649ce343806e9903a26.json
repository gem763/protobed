Alphabet's Waymo and GM Cruise, backed by SoftBank Group's $100 billion Vision Fund, already clocked more than 25,000 kilometers of hands-free rides last year, according to a 2018 report by a California government agency.\n\nLyft Inc has also said it will invest heavily in self-driving cars, while German automaker BMW and Chinese online gaming giant Tencent Holdings have teamed up to launch a computing center in China.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % GM GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY 36.61 +0.30 +0.83% UBER UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC. 33.05 +0.52 +1.60% AAPL APPLE INC. 243.18 +3.22 +1.34% GOOGL ALPHABET INC. 1,257.63 +16.43 +1.32% LYFT LYFT INC. 43.08 -0.48 -1.10%\n\nDrivers also seem primed for the revolution. Many drivers already factor whether a car has self-driving features into their buying decisions, the report by Adobe said, with more interest in connected cars than ever before, with support growing by over 35% in the last year.\n\nMillennials are the most accepting of electric, hybrid and connected vehicles. Many drivers want to enjoy more leisurely activities like enjoying their favorite podcast or catching up on their favorite TV show while their cars drive themselves.\n\nInteractive graphic on top activity picks while in a self-driving car\n\n(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)", "description": "The race for dominance is well under way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/7e7330a7d27a455c871a5203b858d1fb-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
