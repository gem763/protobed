The authors claimed that while Kavanaugh was at Yale, he thrust his genitals into a classmate's face during a party. This was revealed in a New York Times op-ed which the paper later issued a correction for after leaving out key elements of the story. As Townhall has covered, Kelly and Pogrebin's book tour has been anything but stellar so far. Guy details why the Kavanaugh-Yale story was so irresponsible:\n\nvia Guy: The New York Times reporters who've written a new book about the Kavanaugh confirmation have been making the media rounds -- a prestigious press tour that was largely and conspicuously denied to the conservative co-authors of a bestselling, news-packed book on the same subject -- and some of their answers have caught a lot of people's attention. Over the last 24 hours, these journalists have (a) blamed their editors for originally omitting a crucial fact (that the supposed female victim from the \"new\" accusation does not recall the alleged incident ever happening) from an opinion story based on their work, (b) theorized that perhaps the woman couldn't recall the totally uncorroborated claimed occurrence because she was too drunk (pure speculation), and (c) praised Kavanaugh's post-college life and career to the hilt.\n\nAs Mollie Hemingway author of Justice on Trial points out, \"The ACTUAL bombshell in the new book is confirming our explosive reporting in \"Justice on Trial\": Leland Keyser doesn't believe Blasey Ford's story. Keyser was supposed to be a helpful \"witness.'\"\n\nThe ACTUAL bombshell in the new book is confirming our explosive reporting in \"Justice on Trial\": Leland Keyser doesn't believe Blasey Ford's story.

Its dismal review of The Education of Brett Kavanaugh spells even more trouble for Pogrebin and Kelly.", "description": ".09/17/2019 19:27:00PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/283/4b28ff5f-8664-4e42-bae7-acd9d0849d0e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
