Then he calmly pulled out the parts at random and began to reassemble them into flintlocks.\n\nWhat was he thinking?\n\nEveryone present knew that each hand-crafted gun was unique. You couldn't just jam a part from one gun into another and expect either to work. But they did. Blanc had taken enormous pains to ensure that all the parts were precisely the same.\n\nIt was a spectacular demonstration of the power of interchangeable parts.\n\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\n\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

It consists in the making every part of them so exactly alike that what belongs to any one may be used for every one musket in the magazine.\n\n\"I put several together myself taking pieces at hazard as they came to hand, and they fitted in the most perfect manner. The advantages of this, when arms need repair, are evident.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thomas Jefferson was quick to see the potential battlefield advantages of Blanc's approach\n\nBut perhaps those assets were not as clear as he thought, since Jefferson struggled to get his colleagues to embrace the idea.\n\nSo what exactly were the \"evident\" advantages of this system? Jefferson focused on the problem of battlefield repair, a task requiring complex equipment and hours of skilled labour.\n\nBut under Blanc's system, only a few minutes and some rudimentary skill would be required to unscrew the musket, replace the faulty part with an identical component, and screw it all back together, good as new.\n\nNo wonder Blanc's fellow gunsmiths were worried about the future of their profession. And no wonder Thomas Jefferson was so interested in the problem of repairing broken guns.\n\nWhile Jefferson battled to win support, Blanc was struggling too: it was impossibly expensive to hand-craft each piece to the precision required to make the system work.\n\nThe solution already existed, if only Blanc had grasped it. It would not only allow the swift repair of broken weapons, but a revolution in the world economy.\n\nA decade prior to Blanc's demonstration, a metal worker nicknamed John \"Iron-Mad\" Wilkinson had become well-known in Shropshire - on the border between England and Wales. He was famous for his iron boat, iron pulpit, iron desk - and even iron coffin, which he liked to burst out of to surprise visitors.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn fact, he deserves far more fame for inventing, in 1774, a method of boring a hole into a cannon-shaped lump of iron so that it was straight and true every single time.\n\nThat was militarily invaluable. But Iron-Mad Wilkinson hadn't finished.\n\nA few years later, he ordered one of those new-fangled steam engines from a neighbouring business.\n\nBut they had trouble making it work. The piston cylinder, formed of hand-beaten panels of metal, didn't have a perfectly circular cross section and so steam leaked out everywhere around the piston head.\n\nGive it here, said John Wilkinson, and used his cannon-boring method to make a pleasingly round piston cylinder.\n\nHis supplier, a Scotsman named James Watt, never looked back. Equipped with Watt's brilliantly efficient steam engines and Wilkinson's precisely-bored cylinders, the industrial revolution entered a higher gear.\n\nWilkinson and Watt weren't worried about interchangeable parts, as such. They wanted cannonballs to fit into cannons, and pistons to fit into cylinders.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBut the engineering problem they were solving also held the key to the interchangeability that Blanc prized, but was finding it expensive to achieve.\n\nWilkinson had built a machine tool - a tool that automates a manufacturing process.\n\nIt comprised a very sharp drill, a water-mill, and a system of clamping one thing while smoothly rotating another.\n\nBut as Simon Winchester observes in his history of precision engineering, Exactly, these machine tools had a curious side-effect: they put skilled craftsmen out of work in large numbers.\n\nMonsieur Blanc's fellow gunsmiths had been worried that they would lose out on lucrative repair work. But they were about to lose manufacturing jobs, too.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNot only were machine tools better than hand tools, they also didn't require hands to wield them.\n\nThere was a second unlooked-for consequence.\n\nIf you could use machine tools to produce perfectly precise interchangeable parts, that not only made for simple battlefield repair - as Jefferson had seen - but it also made the process of assembly simpler and more predictable.\n\nMore things that made the modern economy:\n\nKilled for spying: The story of the first factory\n\nWhat the dynamo reveals about technological innovation\n\nWhy the falling cost of light matters\n\nCan a computer fool you into thinking it's human?\n\nThe economist Adam Smith's famous description of a pin factory, nine years before Blanc's demonstration, depicted each worker adding a step to what had come before.\n\nBut with interchangeable parts, such a production line could become a far quicker, more predictable and more automated process.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the Americans had finally started to listen to Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe promise he had identified was eventually realised at an armoury at Harper's Ferry in Virginia. In the 1820s, it began to produce, in Winchester's words, \"the first truly mechanically-produced production line objects made anywhere\".\n\nAs Blanc had always intended, they were guns: lock, stock, and barrel.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Henry Ford famously automated large parts of his Model T production process\n\nIt was the beginning of what became known as \"the American system\" of manufacturing, and which produced Isaac Singer's sewing machines, Cyrus McCormick's reapers and harvesters, and - about a century later - Henry Ford's Model T.\n\nFord was a champion of interchangeability, and the Model T production line would have been inconceivable without precisely-machined interchangeable parts.\n\nAs for poor Honor\u00e9 Blanc, he was undone by the French Revolution of 1789 - his dungeon workshop sacked by a mob, his political support guillotined.\n\nHe struggled on, hopelessly in debt.\n\nBlanc may have given birth to an economic revolution, but thanks to a revolution of a very different kind, he never saw his own ideas take shape.\n\nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
