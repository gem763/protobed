(Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nThe President\u2019s best Ukraine defense has always been that any quid pro quo demand of Ukraine was not close to an impeachable offense.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This is the first of a two-column series this weekend, dealing with recent developments in the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats are conducting in connection with President Trump\u2019s dealings with the government of Ukraine.\n\nQuid pro quo . . . it\u2019s the new \u201cby the book.\u201d\n\nYou remember \u201cby the book,\u201d right? No, not \u201cbuy the book,\u201d which I\u2019ve been trying to get people to do since Ball of Collusion was published a few weeks back. I\u2019m talking about by the book. That was the memorable phrase Obama national-security adviser Susan Rice emphasized in her notorious CYA memo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember? The memo took the form of an email. She wrote it while clearing out of her White House office while Donald Trump was being inaugurated. It purported to summarize a meeting more than two weeks earlier, when President Obama held an Oval Office pow-wow on next steps in the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nFully aware that what they were orchestrating was highly irregular (the continuation of a probe targeting the new president even as he entered office), Rice took pains to note that Obama had insisted that everything be done \u201cby the book.\u201d It was a flashing neon sign that \u201cthe book\u201d was being burned. There is no \u201cbook\u201d \u2014 no set of legit procedures and norms \u2014 that endorses the exploitation of executive investigative powers in the service of partisan politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why the Justice Department is pursuing criminal and inspector-general probes of the matter. While we wait on those, Democrats are not idling. With the Mueller collusion caper having flamed out, they have moved on to an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d in the House, focused on President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Much of the country opposes impeachment (especially in Trump-friendly districts Democrats need to win to keep control of the lower chamber), so Democrats have refused to conduct a vote to endorse their inquiry. That shows what thin gruel it is. Their theory, though, is analogous to Obama\u2019s \u201cby the book\u201d practices: They allege that Trump exploited executive power for partisan political purposes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, the impeachment effort got a boost from former ambassador William B. Taylor.\n\nHow much of a boost is hard to say. Thanks to the selective leaking out of Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s secret hearings, we only have access to Taylor\u2019s opening statement. Press reports indicate that he was interviewed for hours and pointedly questioned by Republicans, yet that transcript has been withheld from the public. Emblematic of Schiff\u2019s farcical procedures, only Taylor\u2019s carefully crafted narrative was released. Until we see how the story holds up under cross-examination, preferably in a public hearing, we can\u2019t conclusively assess it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, Taylor is a West Point grad and Vietnam vet with a long career of honorable service to the United States. Thus far, moreover, no one is suggesting that he is lying. The pro-Trump attack on his testimony has focused on (a) the lack of due process in the proceedings; (b) the fact that much of Taylor\u2019s recitation is hearsay (albeit, from what I can glean, the kind of hearsay admissible in most proceedings); and (c) an ill-conceived \u201cthere\u2019s no quid pro quo\u201d contention that I\u2019ll come to momentarily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I discussed with Rich Lowry on The McCarthy Report podcast, the ambassador is clearly grinding some axes.\n\nTaylor is a longtime foreign-service officer. In our present theatrics, he is thus type-cast as a \u201cdeep state\u201d denizen, who resents President Disruptor\u2019s use of an \u201cirregular\u201d channel (headed by Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s private lawyer) in managing Ukraine policy. Taylor also favors foreign aid, a Trump bugaboo; and he was very enthusiastic about Kyiv, which the president was not. No surprise, then, that Taylor was irked by the very thought of the president\u2019s withholding defense aid while eastern Ukraine was under Russian siege \u2014 though Taylor is strangely mum on the fact that Trump has provided the lethal defense aid denied to Ukraine by Obama.\n\nEven factoring in his biases, Taylor\u2019s account has the ring of truth. It also seems to jive with the text messages and other evidence we\u2019ve been allowed to learn about. Indeed, where Taylor\u2019s account differed from the (to my mind) more suspect story told by Gordon Sondland (Trump\u2019s ambassador to the EU), Sondland has since seemed to move in Taylor\u2019s direction, not vice versa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo cut to the chase, Taylor elucidates that there was a quid pro quo in the Trump administration\u2019s conduct of relations with Kyiv. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, wanted both an Oval Office meeting (promised by President Trump in a May 2019 letter) and approximately $400 million in defense aid appropriated by Congress (which had to be transferred by September 30, the end of the U.S. government fiscal year, or it would be lost). Before delivering on these, President Trump pressured Ukraine to assist in what the diplomats referred to as the \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nParticipants in the negotiations understood \u201cinvestigations\u201d to include (a) the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing investigation of the genesis of the Obama administration\u2019s Trump-Russia probe; (b) a possible inquiry into then\u2013Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s role as Obama\u2019s point-man for Ukraine relations (potentially relevant to the Justice Department investigation since the Obama administration allegedly leaned on Ukraine to investigate Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s one-time campaign chairman); and (c) a possible inquiry into potential corruption at Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that retained Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, on its board \u2014 paying him lavishly at the same time as Vice President Biden was extorting Ukraine\u2019s government to fire a prosecutor who was trying to investigate Burisma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat third one was an unusual investigation for the United States to seek (and plainly seemed strange to Taylor). There is no known Justice Department probe of Biden influence-peddling in potential violation of American law. Instead, the president is said to have pressured Ukraine to open an investigation of the Ukrainian company for violations of Ukrainian law. Generally, U.S. requests for investigative assistance involve the foreign power\u2019s provision to the Justice Department of evidence relevant to violations of American law.\n\nWhile not attacking Taylor\u2019s credibility, the president\u2019s backers are adamant that there was no quid pro quo. This refrain returns us to the argument I urged when this controversy emerged a few weeks back: It should have been taken as a given that there was a quid pro quo and that the president was squeezing Ukraine for accommodations, some of which were legitimate (even if unwise), and others harder to defend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo repeat, quid pro quo just means \u201cthis for that.\u201d It\u2019s an exchange, and it is a feature of all commerce. The Latin term only sounds sinister because we most often hear it in connection with bribery and public-corruption prosecutions. But crooked transactions make up just a sliver of state, interstate, and international commerce; in such cases, the problem is not that there is an exchange, but that the exchange involves corruption \u2014 commonly, political influence being sold for favors, or used extortionately.\n\nForeign relations is categorically distinct from domestic law-enforcement. The imposition of quid pro quo demands and intense pressure (even to the point of what would be extortion in the domestic setting) are staples of negotiations between sovereigns. A quid pro quo is improper in foreign relations only when a government official is seeking something that is not arguably in the national interest, particularly if it involves self-dealing \u2014 e.g., using government power to further a personal or partisan political objective.\n\nPresident Trump and his defenders have insisted that there was no quid pro quo. Since there is virtually always a quid pro quo, we must assume that, generally, they mean there was no improper quid pro quo. I say \u201cgenerally\u201d because some actually do posit a legal claim that there was no quid pro quo at all. Ukraine, these Trump supporters say, was unaware that defense aid was being withheld; such awareness, they reason, is the sine qua non of a \u201cquo,\u201d without which there can be no corrupt \u201cquid.\u201d This argument is factually infirm and, in any event, misconstrues impeachment. I will come to that momentarily.\n\nFirst, though, the critical point: The winning argument on behalf of the president is that what happened here is not an impeachable offense. It is untenable to insist that there was no quid pro quo \u2014 just as it is outlandish for the president to claim that his July 25 conversation with President Zelensky was \u201cperfect,\u201d an impossible standard to meet in human endeavors. To stake out an untenable position is a self-defeating strategy in public controversies.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony illustrates what has long been patent: President Trump was not as high on Ukraine or foreign aid as his subordinates. He saw Ukraine as pervasively corrupt, as well as hostile to him in the 2016 campaign. He also saw it as another instance of America bearing the burden of free-riding Europe\u2019s security problems, at the additional cost of what he dubiously believes would be better relations with Russia. The president was not anxious to part with $400 million, and was of a mind to make Ukraine earn it by doing things he wanted done: assistance in the afore-described investigations.\n\nThis came to a head, almost comically in Taylor\u2019s telling, in September 2019. As Taylor understood it from speaking with Sondland and NSC official Tim Morrison, the president \u2014 echoed by Sondland \u2014 was insistent that there was no quid pro quo. But this was lip-service. Simultaneously, the Ukrainians were being told that unless Zelensky publicly committed to the investigations, neither the defense aid nor the promised White House visit would materialize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn substance, this is no different than Obama\u2019s \u201cby the book\u201d bunkum. A president\u2019s talismanic utterance of \u201cby the book\u201d does not transform a highly irregular counterintelligence probe of political opponents into nothing-to-see-here. Similarly, mantra-like invocations of \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d do not eviscerate the demands on which a president tries to condition executive acts sought by a foreign government.\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d some of the president\u2019s congressional supporters say, \u201cthere can\u2019t have been a quid pro quo because Zelensky says he never felt pressured and the Ukrainians did not know the aid was being withheld until August 29\u201d (i.e., over a month after the Trump-Zelensky call).\n\nThis misstates the facts. First, the president did not just withhold aid; he refused to schedule the coveted Oval Office visit he had promised Zelensky \u2014 and the Ukrainians were quite aware of and antsy about that. Second, one must suspend disbelief to think, just because the hold on the aid was not reported (by Politico) until August 29, that the Ukrainians did not notice the expected aid hadn\u2019t been transferred while they were being pushed on the investigations. (Ukraine\u2019s economy is only about the size of Arkansas\u2019s; a $400 million shortfall would not go unnoticed.) Third, Taylor says the Ukrainians undoubtedly knew about the hold on the funding by August 29; it was not lifted until nearly two weeks later. In the interim, Sondland is said to have told the Ukrainians there would be a \u201cstalemate\u201d if they did not accede. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say \u201cstalemate\u201d is Ukrainian for \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d but you get the point.\n\nMore significantly, the president\u2019s advocates misperceive the nature of the House Democrats\u2019 inquiry. This is not a bribery prosecution in a judicial court. This is impeachment, in which there is no burden to prove a quid pro quo beyond a reasonable doubt. The House is not required to establish a felony offense, such as extortion or bribery (an element of which is a corrupt quid pro quo). In theory, House Democrats could vote an article of impeachment alleging that the president abused power by leveraging his control of foreign relations for partisan political purposes \u2014 viz., to induce the Ukrainians to investigate a potential 2020 rival. Impeachment does not require proving a penal offense up to courtroom standards. It is a political act, not a legal one: the stripping of authority by the legislature, not the establishment of a crime in court.\n\nThe president\u2019s defense here is not that there was no quid pro quo. It is that the quid pro quo does not come close to an impeachable offense.
