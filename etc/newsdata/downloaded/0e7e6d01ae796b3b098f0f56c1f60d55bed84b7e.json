Hailing from Pune, the versatile thespian knows how to strike a balance between content-driven, niche and commercial films. Apte, who\u2019s fiercely protective of her personal life, reflects back to her own unusual but endearing wedding ceremony.Being the proverbial \u2018outsider\u2019, Radhika Apte is a rarity and a new-gen star who\u2019s known for two things: essaying complex roles and speaking her mind.Someone who has never shied away from venturing onto risky terrain, Apte started her career in theatres and before making her Bollywood debut with a small role in the Hindi film Vaah! Life Ho Toh Aisi! Resilient and daring, ambitious and edgy, she is often seen taking up roles that aren\u2019t just big but significant, focusing more on content than the glamour of showbiz. And with box office successes like Pad Man, Andhadhun and Kabali, she is now a darling to all leading directors and producers and has amassed a cult following on Netflix, headlining the originals Ghoul, Lust Stories and Sacred Games. Dressed in an easy-breezy floral skater dress, she greets me with a wide grin, slumps into her chair and gets ready to multi-task; she\u2019s going to answer the volley of questions I shoot at her while getting her hair and make-up done.When I came here for the first time, I didn\u2019t know much about the industry\u2014I didn\u2019t have friends here and so I had no direction of any sort. The pace of the city was very different for me and I just couldn\u2019t deal with it so I went back. Then I returned with my partner who knew much more about Mumbai than I did. Also, I was a little more confident this time round because I knew more thanks to my theatre work\u2014that helped tremendously.London changed my perceptions on many levels. I met people from different countries, with different cultures and backgrounds. That\u2019s when I realised that we live in a bubble and have certain notions and ideas about the world, about what is right and wrong\u2014we put a lot of pressure on ourselves. London, in a way, helped broaden my perspective and made me understand that the kind of cultural-social pressure that we carry on ourselves is not actually needed.It needs to challenge and excite me. Something about the project needs to do either of the two, if not both.If I like a film, it doesn\u2019t matter what genre it is. I like drama, comedy, action, thriller, romance, horror\u2014all genres. I also don\u2019t think that films should fit into one category exclusively. It\u2019s always easier to be part of films that are in the same language that you speak; you get to improvise when you understand what\u2019s happening on the sets. Language also helps you understand the nuances of the culture better.Every character requires a different type of preparation. A lot of it has to do with your collaboration with the director and your co-actors. Some characters require a lot of research to be done, while others require a lot of practice. So, the process may differ each time. I\u2019m not someone who gets attached; I detach myself from my character with a lot of ease and it almost happens automatically when I\u2019m done shooting.As I said, I don\u2019t get attached to things or even the work that I do. All my characters have taught me something and so they are all very dear to me. I feel like I\u2019ve learned something different from each of them and can\u2019t pick one over the other!I can\u2019t think of a reason that\u2019s good enough where I need to be ashamed of my body.It took me a while to deal with it. The filmmakers wanted a certain body type. I needed to get a little bit fitter and I could have easily done that... It\u2019s just very stressful to look a certain way\u2014to be a certain way\u2014constantly. That\u2019s the difficult part. We focus a lot on being thin rather than being fit and that\u2019s the problem. Certain body types are never going to be slim because of various reasons like bone structure, hormonal issues etc. We are blessed to have a lot of actors and influencers who do promote a very healthy self-and body image. But, unfortunately, the world still goes behind people who\u2019ve had a lot of surgeries. They\u2019re the ones with massive followers on social media. People are keen to know what they eat and drink to look the way they do. In a world like that, I don\u2019t have much to say.I think if you just use common sense, you will understand it all. But, most of the time, we\u2019re turning a blind eye to a lot of things. People think that they benefit from power, but superiority is also a complex and it\u2019s not nice. I try to do my part. I try to speak up whenever I can, and in whatever way I can. I try not to compromise on this in my own life too because I truly believe equality benefits everyone.I\u2019m not an expert to speak about this but I sincerely hope things continue to change. Everybody needs change. No one likes to eat the same food every day. Similarly, every decade brings along with it some change majorly in the form of content. Sometimes, I feel that we are very comfortable with our content and there\u2019s a lot more scope for change. However, I\u2019m glad to see that things are changing.A lot of things have led to this change. Firstly, change is inevitable and so things must change. Then, a lot of people who are now part of the industry have not been from the industry previously. We have writers, producers, directors from different backgrounds and cultures and they have different kinds of stories to tell. A lot of them have personal stories to tell. For example, Nawazuddin (Siddiqui), Ayushmann (Khurrana) and Rajkummar (Rao) have no previous ties to the industry and so the audience relates to them. They want to watch them play different kinds of roles. Also, because of the digital revolution, people are watching content from all over the world and have developed an appetite for such content. In India, a large population still does not watch digital content, which is why films are so big in our country.There is no difference. It\u2019s the same.Good! That\u2019s my reaction. (Laughs)When I got married, I wore my grandmother\u2019s old sari for my registered wedding and it had a lot of holes in it. But I wore it because she\u2019s one of my favourite people on the planet. I\u2019m not really someone who spends a lot of money on fancy clothes and especially not for a registered marriage. Of course, I wanted to look good\u2014I did buy a dress for my party (which was less than ten thousand rupees!). Also, I have to tell you this; I bought that dress at the last minute because I forgot to buy one! I\u2019m not a picky person when it comes to clothes.I personally feel commitment can happen without marriage. But for a lot of people, marriage is a very sacred thing and I see why; I see the celebration of unity, I see the value of taking vows, I do see how the event is celebrated and how much importance it holds to certain people, but while growing up, I never wanted to get married. It\u2019s not that I disrespect marriage. Even though I had a registered marriage, it was a very important day in my life because I have great memories of it.I like sangeets because it brings people together and everybody is fooling around and having loads of fun. When I got married, my partner and I wanted a ritual but neither of us is religious so we gave our guests seeds and asked them to plant a tree with us. Each family member present at our wedding planted a tree. We had about 80 people planting around 30-35 trees on that day. Everybody was wearing nice clothes but nobody cared that their clothes were getting soiled. I did promise them free mangoes (smiles). I love group activities that brings people together.I\u2019m all about minimal jewellery. I love rings, especially toe rings.It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s traditional or modern look as long as it\u2019s light, breezy and comfortable\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine having bruises on my body when I take off my clothes!", "description": "Radical and rare: Hailing from Pune, Radhika Apte knows how to strike a balance between content-driven, niche and commercial films, and believes in equality", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/radhika11570617372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
