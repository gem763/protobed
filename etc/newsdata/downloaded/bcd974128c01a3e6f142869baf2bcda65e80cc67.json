This season, he expects to do more \u2014 and he has, recording at least a point in each of the past three games.\n\nHis two-point night Saturday helped power the Capitals to their first regulation win in Dallas since 1995.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing on the top six you are expected to contribute offensively, you\u2019re expected to get more chances to score, you\u2019re expected to contribute,\u201d Wilson said before Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the responsibility on skating with those guys and on the top line.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBehind Wilson\u2019s early goal, goaltender Ilya Samsonov\u2019s second NHL win and defenseman John Carlson\u2019s third consecutive strong game, the Capitals (3-1-2) broke a three-game losing streak.\n\nAfter getting a split on this trip to Nashville and Dallas, the Capitals return for a three-game homestand.\n\nMost importantly, the Capitals didn\u2019t blow a third-period lead against Dallas, stopping a trend that marred their previous two losses. After entering the final period up, 2-0, center Evgeny Kuznetsov provided an insurance goal at the 3:35 mark of the third to push the lead to 3-0.\n\nAD\n\nKuznetsov has recorded a point in each of the three games he\u2019s played since returning from suspension (one goal, two assists).\n\nThe Stars (1-4-1) trimmed the lead to 3-1 when Radek Faksa beat Samsonov with 13 minutes left, but Dallas would get no closer. Captain Alex Ovechkin scored an empty-netter with 56.7 seconds left to close the scoring.\n\nAD\n\nSamsonov (24 saves) has won his first two NHL starts and continues to look the part of the team\u2019s goaltender of the future with starter Braden Holtby in a contract year.\n\nThe Capitals got thing started early on offense thanks to Wilson, who poked in a rebound off a shot from Jakub Vrana on the power play. The Stars asked for a replay review, believing a hand pass preceded the goal, but the goal stood.\n\nAD\n\nWilson\u2019s goal was the second of the year from the Capitals\u2019 second unit on the power play. After starting the season 0-for-11 with the man advantage, the Capitals are 3-for-10 in the past two games. The Capitals\u2019 penalty kill was also 6-for-6 on the night.\n\nThe Capitals doubled their lead at 7:13 of the second period when Carlson scored off a failed breakout. Carlson has two goals and eight assists through six games. Carlson has elevated his play as the leader of the blue line, which is still without Michal Kempny (hamstring).\n\nAD\n\nAlso assisting on Carlson\u2019s goal was fourth-liners Garnet Hathaway and center Nic Dowd, who was inserted into the lineup over Chandler Stephenson. Stephenson was the team\u2019s fourth-line center in the past two contests, but Capitals Coach Todd Reirden decided to put Dowd back into the lineup Saturday, leading to the unit\u2019s most cohesive performance yet. Hathaway has one goal and two assists while Dowd\u2019s assist marked his first points of the campaign.\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Tom Wilson, John Carlson continue strong play as Capitals get first regulation win in Dallas since 1995.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r9Swc-YbGTbfFDf1ORsCHF1zze4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S4MI5ZHNNAI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
