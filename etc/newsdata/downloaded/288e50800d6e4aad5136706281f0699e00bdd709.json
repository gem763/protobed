Adam Schiff, D-Calif., speaks before Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on testimony by the acting director of national intelligence and a whistleblower complaint (all times local):\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says President Donald Trump's actions detailed in a newly released whistleblower complaint read like \"a classic organized crime shakedown.\"\n\nSchiff on Thursday opened a hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Maguire released the complaint to Congress and the public this week after weeks of delay.\n\nThe complaint details a call between Trump and Ukraine's president in which Trump pressures the leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden.\n\nDemocrats have criticized Maguire for withholding the complaint.\n\nSchiff says the whistleblower shows \"more of a dedication of country, more of an understanding of the president's oath of office, than the president himself.\"\n\nTrump has denied doing anything wrong.\n\n___\n\n9:10 a.m.\n\nThe White house claims the intelligence whistleblower's complaint about President Donald Trump's efforts to seek dirt from Ukraine on former Vice President Joe Biden \"shows nothing improper.\"\n\nPress secretary Stephanie Grisham argues the complaint \"is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings.\"\n\nGrisham adds that Trump released a rough transcript of his call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday \"because he has nothing to hide.\"\n\nHouse Democrats who have read the document say it's \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nGrisham says, \"The White House will continue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by Democrats and many in the main stream media.\"\n\n___\n\n9:05 a.m.\n\nThe intelligence whistleblower's complaint at the center of House Democrats' impeachment probe into President Donald Trump raises concerns about Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani's role in seeking assistance from Ukraine to benefit the president's 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nThe redacted and anonymous complaint was released Thursday by the House intelligence committee.\n\nThe complaint suggests that Ukrainian leadership was \"led to believe\" that a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was conditioned on whether Zelenskiy \"showed willingness to 'play ball'\" on issues raised by Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani had publicly stated his intention to secure from Ukraine derogatory information about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe complaint also details concerns from U.S. officials about \"Giuliani's circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes.\"\n\n___\n\n8:50 a.m.\n\nIn the days following the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's new president, senior White House officials intervened to \"lock down\" all records of the call. That's according to a declassified whistleblower complaint released Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe complaint says that the whistleblower learned about the effort from \"multiple U.S. officials.\"\n\nCommittee members are hearing testimony Thursday on the complaint and details of the July 25 call on which Trump prodded Ukraine's leader to work with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the U.S. attorney general to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has said he's done nothing wrong. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\n___\n\n8:40 a.m.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has released a redacted version of a whistleblower complaint at the center of Democrats' impeachment probe of President Donald Trump.\n\nLawmakers began reviewing a classified version of the complaint Wednesday evening ahead of testimony Thursday morning by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. House Democrats who have read the document say it's \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nThe whistleblower's identity has not been made public.\n\nThe complaint is at least in part related to a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump prodded Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of that call Wednesday morning.\n\n___\n\n7:50 a.m.\n\nMembers of Congress have a redacted, declassified version of an intelligence whistleblower complaint that is at the center of House Democrats' impeachment probe into President Donald Trump.", "description": "Schiff on Thursday opened a hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.
