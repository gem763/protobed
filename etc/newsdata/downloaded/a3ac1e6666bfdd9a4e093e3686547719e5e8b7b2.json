Google stopped the program globally and began conducting an internal review.\n\nUsers have now been given more control over their data via the Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) setting. If you are happy for Google to make use of audio clips generated through your interaction with the Google Assistant, then you can opt-in to VAA.\n\nGoogle says that user clips will not be used in human review processes unless users review and re-confirm their VAA selection.\n\nCNET: The best facial recognition cameras of 2019\n\nIn addition, recordings will not be saved by default, and past, historical audio clips can be deleted by users.\n\nGoogle says that the company intends to \"vastly reduce the amount of audio data we store,\" and if users have opted-in to VAA, the \"vast majority\" of audio clips and recordings connected to their accounts will be automatically deleted if older than a few months.\n\nThis change has not landed yet but is expected to be in place later this year.\n\nWhen it comes to accidental clips that do not contain the assistant's wake words, the tech giant has promised to up its game by adding a setting in the future for controlling Google Assistant device audio sensitivity.\n\nThe \"Your data in the Assistant\" page can be accessed to check your current settings, and in light of these changes, tweak any option you are not comfortable with.\n\n\"We believe in putting you in control of your data, and we always work to keep it safe,\" Tasca says. \"We're committed to being transparent about how our settings work so you can decide what works best for you.\"\n\nTechRepublic: Governments still struggling to contend with weaponized social media platforms\n\nGoogle is not the only company that has recently come under fire for its usage of audio data. Amazon was the first firm to be criticized after it was discovered that human operators were eavesdropping on Alexa device interactions with owners and there was no way for users to remove their recordings unless deleted manually.\n\nThe company has now introduced voice commands for users to wipe their data history clean.\n\nApple, too, decided to change its stance on audio clips obtained from Siri and after suspending its own program in which human staff listened in to recordings, deciding to cut out third-party contractors and use Apple employees only to analyze clips. Users now have the opportunity to opt-in, or out, at their leisure.\n\nFacebook, too, recently confirmed that voice recordings from Portal devices may be analyzed by humans, but users can choose not to store commands if they wish for interactions to remain private.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
