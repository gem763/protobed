So it can be difficult to find out what the landlord is like.\"\n\nIt was this that motivated her to leave a review of her landlord online - to make sure prospective tenants had access to this information.\n\nImage copyright Anna-Ruth Cockerham Image caption Anna-Ruth Cockerham says review websites make renters aware of any issues with a house before they sign a contract\n\nThe assistant chief executive of student housing charity Unipol, Nicola Brown, says reviews are particularly helpful for young people, who have less renting experience and may not know what is acceptable practice.\n\nThe charity launched Rate Your Landlord, a review website for students in Leeds, in partnership with Leeds University Union in 2016.\n\nLike Marks Out Of Tenancy, the site is not just about exposing bad practice - it also holds an annual awards ceremony to highlight good landlords.\n\n\"This site doesn't have value as a 'hate your landlord' website,\" Nicola says. \"It has value in being something where people can be signposted towards the best landlords as well as seeing which are the worst.\"\n\nNevertheless, review websites have still provoked concern from some landlords.\n\nDavid Smith, policy director for the Residential Landlords Association, warns \"there is no real guarantee of who is posting, or whether their experiences are genuine\".\n\nOwen O'Neill, a landlord in Birmingham, is also wary about the risk of fake reviews.\n\n\"In principle I've got no problem with it,\" he says. \"It's good to get customer feedback.\"\n\nBut he says landlords must be notified about any review so they can respond - and they need to be sure the reviewer was actually a tenant.\n\nBen stresses that Marks Out Of Tenancy encourages landlords and letting agents to reply to reviews, which are moderated for potentially defamatory content and to check the tenant lived in the property.\n\nRate Your Landlord also verifies and moderates reviews before giving landlords the chance to respond ahead of publication.\n\nImage copyright Rate Your Landlord Image caption Sue Michaels (second left) won an award from Rate Your Landlord after being rated highly on the site\n\nNicola says some landlords now recognise the site as a useful marketing tool.\n\nSue Michaels, a student landlord in Leeds, says she is often contacted by potential tenants who have found her on Rate Your Landlord. She also feels the site is important for pushing up standards across the sector.\n\n\"How can we improve things unless the bad landlords and agents are highlighted?\" she adds.\n\nOne of the limitations of sites like Marks Out Of Tenancy is the number of reviews available - it has had 850 since it began in 2017.\n\nHowever, with similar websites popping up across the UK, the demand for such information appears to be growing. Rate Your Landlord currently has more than 3,600 reviews in Leeds and a target of 1,000 new reviews every year.\n\nBen also wants to see his website grow.\n\n\"More people need to know about this if we are going to take any steps to making renting better,\" he says.", "description": "Tenants reveal how they are turning to review websites to rate landlords and warn other tenants.", "authors": ["Becky Morton", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46D3/production/_108313181_benyarrow-bristol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
