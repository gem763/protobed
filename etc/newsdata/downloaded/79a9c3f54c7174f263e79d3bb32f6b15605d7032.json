On Sunday, black-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs at police who responded with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets.\n\nThey are angry at what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong's affairs, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.", "description": "Hong Kong's financial secretary says the anti-government protests have been a blow to the city's economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/702c65ecfca441c8bf2be2ff69f644ce_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
