The decision, announced Sunday night by the White House, came after a call between Trump and Erdogan.\n\nIn a Wednesday afternoon statement released by the White House, Trump stressed the United States \u201cdoes not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nBut he also said the United States should not be part of \u201cendless, senseless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form. We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. military relied on the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is led by the Kurds, as the local ground force fighting ISIS. But Ankara considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists who are an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.\n\nAnkara has long threatened to attack the Kurds in Syria, but held off while U.S. troops acted as a buffer.\n\nU.S. lawmakers in both parties blasted Trump\u2019s decision as abandoning the United States\u2019 Kurdish partners to be slaughtered by Turkey, sending a chilling message to any would-be U.S. partners going forward.\n\nThey have also raised fears the chaos will lead to an ISIS resurgence, including the likelihood that ISIS prisoners will escape when their guards shift their own focus to fighting Turkey.\n\nJust before Erdogan\u2019s announcement, Trump ally Sen.

The Cheney/Graham Neocon War Caucus has cost us too much fighting endless wars.\u201d\n\nAt about the same time that Erdo\u011fan announced the start of the offensive, the SDF said \u201ccivilian areas\u201d were being struck by Turkish warplanes.\n\n\u201cTurkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas. There is a huge panic among people of the region,\u201d SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali tweeted.\n\nThe SDF\u2019s Coordination and Military Operations Center tweeted out video showing plumes of smoke emanating from the town of Qamishli. It also said Turkish aircraft were flying over the town of Ras al-Ayn \u201cafter an hour-long of artillery and aerial bombardment that killed civilians and injured many others.\u201d\n\nPrior to Trump\u2019s decision to pull back from northeast Syria, the United States was working on setting up a safe zone near Syria\u2019s border with Turkey to assuage Ankara\u2019s concerns.\n\nAs part of setting up the safe zone, the SDF pulled its defenses from the area. Without its defenses, the SDF on Wednesday asked the United States to implement a no fly zone.\n\n\u201cThe #SDF showed good faith to the security mechanism agreement between the #US & #Turkey. This left our people defenseless,\u201d the SDF\u2019s Coordination and Military Operations Center tweeted. \u201cWe ask the US & the @Coalition for a NO FLY ZONE to stop the attacks on innocent people.\u201d", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Wednesday the Turkish military and a Syrian militia have begun a military operation against Kurdish forces in northern Syria,\u00a0days after President Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syrianrebelsturkey_10082019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
