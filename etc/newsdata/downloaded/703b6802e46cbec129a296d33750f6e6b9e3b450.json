The target was a Vietnamese man named Hieu Minh Ngo. Investigators believed he was a big-time identity thief who sold packages of data known as \u201cfullz,\u201d each of which typically included a person\u2019s name, date of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name, Social Security number, and e-mail address and password. Criminals could buy fullz from Ngo for as little as eight cents and then use them to open credit cards, take out loans, or file for bogus tax refunds. They could also pay Ngo for access to a vast database of people\u2019s personal records. As part of the operation, an agent attempted to buy the identities of hundreds of U.S. citizens. In such illegal transactions\u2014be they for drugs, guns, or stolen identities\u2014finding a payment system that both sides trust can be tricky. Cash is safest because it leaves no record. But handing over a briefcase stuffed with bills isn\u2019t an option when the parties are on opposite sides of the planet. Ngo suggested an alternative. In an e-mail to the agent, he offered simple instructions: \u201cPlease pay to our LR: U8109093.\u201d\n\nThe eight-digit code was Ngo\u2019s account number. LR stood for Liberty Reserve, a digital currency somewhat similar to bitcoin. Users could buy LRs, as they were known, for $1 apiece and use them to pay anyone else who had a Liberty Reserve account. They could also store their money in the system. It was, in effect, a bank, a digital currency, and a payment method in one. For criminals like Ngo, the appeal of dealing in LRs was anonymity. Whereas traditional banks require you to provide at least one official form of identification, Liberty Reserve didn\u2019t verify users\u2019 identities. All they needed was an e-mail address. The U.S. government eventually arrested Ngo and charged him with 15 crimes, including substantive wire fraud and identity theft. He had allowed nearly 1,400 criminals to access a database containing the personal information of 200 million U.S. citizens\u2014almost two-thirds of the population. Ngo pleaded guilty to wire, identity, and computer fraud and is due to be sentenced next month. It was a big win for the Secret Service, which is charged with safeguarding our financial infrastructure, and for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. But officials had an even more ambitious plan in the works. U.S. authorities had begun to notice that suspects in unrelated investigations were using Liberty Reserve to move dirty money. They had come to believe that it was a central hub for people engaged in credit-card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking. It was, in their estimation, the underworld\u2019s payment method of choice\u2014a system designed to help criminals make untraceable transactions.\n\nAnd they wanted to shut it down. The allure of going after Liberty Reserve was undeniable. In theory, it was an even bigger target than Silk Road, an online marketplace that sold illegal goods\u2014an Amazon for the criminal world, until the FBI busted it in 2013. After all, why go after lone actors like Ngo, or even an entire marketplace, if instead you could find a way to destroy the very currency that bad guys around the globe appeared to be using? At the heart of the government\u2019s probe were two crucial questions: How many criminals were using Liberty Reserve? And had they hijacked the system, or were they the intended users? The underworld is a realm that thrives on paranoia. On May 24, 2013, criminals across the globe had good reason to panic: they couldn\u2019t access their Liberty Reserve accounts. Rather mysteriously, the company\u2019s Web site had stopped working. There were no explanations, no \u201cWe\u2019re experiencing technical difficulties\u201d notices. The home page simply redirected to a blank screen. Those who bothered to investigate further learned that the domain name for that blank page was controlled by a nonprofit organization called the Shadowserver Foundation. Its own Web site featured a faceless man in a dark hat and declared: \u201cThe Shadowserver Foundation gathers intelligence on the darker side of the internet. We are comprised of volunteer security professionals from around the world.\u201d It appeared that the Liberty Reserve Web site had been taken down, at least temporarily, by a team of pro bono crime fighters.\n\nBy evening, a group of \u201ccarders\u201d\u2014cybercriminals who specialize in selling stolen credit-card numbers\u2014had gathered online at a secure forum known as carder.pro to discuss the situation. According to Damon McCoy, a George Mason University professor who studies cybercrime, such forums are not open to the public; you must apply to join the discussion. \u201cThey vet you to make sure you are a good criminal,\u201d he told me. Despite not being able to access their accounts, some of the carders remained hopeful. \u201cLR will be back and give everyone triple their account balance,\u201d one wrote. Another, who called himself \u201cNinja,\u201d offered a standing $1,000 bet that Liberty Reserve would soon resume operating. But most seemed worried. Rumors and speculation flew about Liberty Reserve and its creator, Arthur Budovsky. p3rito: I don\u2019t know if LR will back or no I don\u2019t know if owner was arrested or no. Zeus197 : I think no real arrested and LR will come back. PlraX : Maybe this circus was created by fucker LR onwer to run away whit all our money and start anohter project. ochov : I agree. he runaway with the money. Roger : Why would he need to create any drama, if he wanted to run away, he could just run, and there would be nothing you could do about it. One member wrote, rather smugly: \u201cI don\u2019t keep even a penny for long period on virtual currencies. Coz I trust nobody.\u201d This remark seemed to get right at the crux of the matter. Liberty Reserve was a financial system, like all others, built on trust. In buying into the system, users were trusting that the people running it would operate fairly and protect their interests.\n\nAnd the system that Budovsky built had inspired confidence. At one point, Liberty Reserve had more than 1 million users. Their faith was key. After all, this wasn\u2019t just an electronic payment system Budovsky was operating. It was a currency, too. In theory, he could have \u201cprinted\u201d as many LRs as he wanted, and used the money to line his own pockets. Or he could have made off with all the funds in users\u2019 accounts. For the system to work, they had to feel safe. In effect, they had to believe in Budovsky. Now that Liberty Reserve was frozen, and fortunes stood to be lost, users around the globe began frantically searching the Internet in the hope of gleaning a clue about Arthur Budovsky. Everything seemed to hinge on who this man was and what his intentions were.\n\nOver the past several months, I corresponded with Budovsky by e-mail and met him twice in person. I also met his mother, Irina, who told me she felt from the start that her son was exceptional. When he was born, in 1973, Irina was living in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, where she worked as a bookkeeper at a factory that made washing machines. Irina separated from her husband, Victor Budovsky, when Arthur was just 2 years old, and she and her only child grew very close. \u201cHe was not only a son, he was my friend\u2014my best friend,\u201d Irina told me. Arthur was always an unusual boy, she said: serious, bookish, and uncomplaining.\n\nIrina got married again, to an engineer named Anatoly, and in 1990, when Budovsky was 17, the family emigrated to the United States. They settled in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. It was a Hasidic neighborhood, and Budovsky was initially puzzled by the people he saw in the streets: flocks of somber-looking men always dressed in black suits. For a while he thought he was witnessing a succession of funerals, and wondered why his neighbors seemed to be dying in droves. Budovsky briefly attended Abraham Lincoln High School, in Brighton Beach, but then dropped out. Not long afterward, he had a nervous breakdown. Irina told me doctors diagnosed him with \u201coutside phobia\u201d\u2014whenever he ventured onto the street, he was overcome with dizziness and nausea. His mother said that for two or three years, Budovsky refused to step outside the apartment. (Budovsky insists it was just nine months.) While he was holed up, Budovsky\u2019s parents used their savings to buy him a computer. \u201cIt was around $2,000\u2014for us it was crazy money,\u201d Irina said. Almost immediately, Budovsky took it apart. Irina walked into his room, saw the mess, and expressed her horror. To her amazement, he quickly reassembled the machine. \u201cHe sat with the computer 24 hours a day,\u201d Irina said. Budovsky\u2019s fear of the outside world gradually diminished. He began working as a computer consultant, starting with just a few individual clients and eventually helping small businesses set up their networks. He also reconnected with an acquaintance named Vladimir Kats, a Russian immigrant from St. Petersburg. They had met while working at a day camp for kids, not long after Budovsky arrived in the United States.\n\nBudovsky described Kats to me as willful, smart, lazy, and extremely libertarian. Kats also had a dark side. In 2013, he would plead guilty to receiving child pornography. This came as no surprise to Budovsky. \u201cThe right for everyone to possess child pornography was always a strong and unshakable belief of his,\u201d Budovsky told me. This belief, he said, was part of Kats\u2019s larger conviction that government oversight was not just undesirable, but wrong. Budovsky told me he disapproved of Kats\u2019s affinity for child porn, but the two young men nonetheless became close friends. They shared a love of computers and in the early 2000s became interested in the emerging world of digital currencies. The pioneer of this field was, oddly enough, a radiation oncologist from Florida named Douglas Jackson. In 1996, Jackson had launched e-gold, the world\u2019s first truly successful digital currency. Jackson had envisioned e-gold as being free of government regulation, and immune to the ups and downs of the financial markets, because it was backed by actual gold, in the form of bars stored in vaults. Budovsky and Kats were intrigued by what Jackson was doing, and in 2002 they bought an online currency exchanger known as GoldAge and set about expanding the business. GoldAge was a middleman\u2014if you wanted to convert dollars to e-gold, or vice versa, you needed to use such an outfit. Budovsky and Kats took a commission of 2 to 4 percent on every transaction, and, according to a subsequent indictment, they converted tens of millions of dollars. The way Budovsky tells it, he envisioned Liberty Reserve as PayPal for people around the world who don\u2019t have bank accounts or credit cards. Budovsky said he felt that he was at the vanguard of a revolutionary way of banking. But trouble was brewing. After the September 11 attacks, U.S. authorities grew increasingly concerned that money transmitters, such as check-cashing businesses and wire services, offered terrorists and other criminals an easy way to move money. So when Congress passed the Patriot Act, in 2001, it included provisions to make prosecuting money transmitters easier, especially if they failed to get a government-issued license. It was unclear how these rules applied to digital currencies and exchangers, though, and Budovsky never applied for a license.\n\nOne summer night in 2006, at 4:30 a.m., he heard a loud knock on his front door. Groggily, he rose from his bed and asked who it was. A voice on the other side of the door said that his car was parked improperly and had to be moved. \u201cI opened the door, and a swat team came in,\u201d Budovsky told me. \u201cThey screamed, \u2018Where\u2019s the money and where are the weapons?\u2019 I said I had no weapons and the money was in my wallet. They thought I was being sarcastic, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Budovsky was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney for operating a money-transmitting business without a license. He was given five years of probation. A year later, the federal government indicted Douglas Jackson, the radiation oncologist, and the other principal operators of e-gold. According to the indictment, e-gold\u2019s database had records of criminal activities its users were engaged in\u2014with such notations as \u201cchild porn,\u201d \u201cscammer,\u201d and \u201cCC fraud.\u201d Jackson contested the charges but ultimately pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiring to engage in money laundering. He served no jail time. E-gold was allowed to continue functioning under stricter requirements, but it lost users and eventually shut down. The digital-currency boom seemed to be on the wane. Budovsky, however, had already begun working\u2014with some help from Kats\u2014on a digital currency of his own. Budovsky and I e-mailed each other almost daily, and in these exchanges he maintained a grandiose, even anachronistic politeness. It was common for him to sign off with a rhetorical flourish, wishing me and my family safe travels, an enjoyable weekend, good health. At times I felt as if I were trading missives with a friendly aristocrat from the 1800s.\n\nThe way Budovsky tells it, he envisioned Liberty Reserve as PayPal for the unbanked. Americans have come to rely on PayPal as a safe and easy way to buy things on the Internet. There\u2019s just one catch: you need a credit card or bank account. For people the world over, this is a nonstarter. By some estimates, as many as 2.5 billion people don\u2019t have credit histories or bank accounts with verifiable balances. They are effectively shut out of the modern economy. Budovsky told me repeatedly that he just wanted to build a better, faster, easier payment method. \u201cThe current banking system has not invented anything new for quite some time, while the world and technology have moved on,\u201d he said. \u201cThis made me think, What can be improved?\u201d His goal was to keep it simple. Users would go through exchangers to buy LRs, just as they had in order to buy e-gold. Liberty Reserve would take a 1 percent commission on all transactions made within its system. For an additional \u201cprivacy fee\u201d of 75 cents, users could hide their account number when sending LRs, making the transfer untraceable. Liberty Reserve\u2019s most obvious competitor was bitcoin, which launched in 2009 and is called the first decentralized digital currency because it is maintained by volunteers around the world who verify and record transactions in a public ledger. Many libertarians have embraced bitcoin as a way to break\u2014or at least circumvent\u2014government\u2019s stranglehold on currency. The downside of bitcoin, from a user\u2019s perspective, is that its value fluctuates wildly. Liberty Reserve was designed to be more stable: LRs were pegged to the U.S. dollar. What\u2019s more, Liberty Reserve was run as a for-profit venture, with headquarters in Costa Rica.\n\nBudovsky says he chose Costa Rica simply because he had visited on vacation and fallen in love with the place: \u201cI quickly became a victim to the stunning beauty of the country, the friendliness of its residents, the whole pura vida concept of life,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnyone who has been to that magic country can understand what I am saying.\u201d As it turned out, in 2006, when Liberty Reserve was incorporated, the country was teeming with entrepreneurs, thanks to lax regulations and the fact that companies based there did not have to pay taxes on profits earned outside the country. David Boddiger, the editor of an English-language news site based in Costa Rica called The Tico Times, told me that in the mid-2000s, Costa Rica had struggled to rein in online gambling and Ponzi schemes. \u201cIt probably seemed like the perfect environment to set up this type of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no military; it\u2019s a small, democratic country with underfunded and understaffed law-enforcement agencies and an inefficient justice system.\u201d Costa Rica was also increasingly known as a place where dirty money could be cleaned. The country\u2019s geography\u2014with drug producers to the south and their customers to the north\u2014was ideal for money launderers. According to Global Financial Integrity, a nonprofit that monitors international money laundering, Costa Rica exported $5.4 billion in laundered money in 2006, equivalent to 24 percent of its GDP. By 2012, that number was up to $21.6 billion\u2014a whopping 48 percent of GDP. \u00d3lger Bogantes Calvo, the deputy director of the country\u2019s anti-narcotics enforcement agency, told me that the government simply never has the funds, manpower, or materiel to fight the criminal elements it faces. \u201cRealistically, [the criminals] will always be a step ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, none of this proves that Budovsky had nefarious intentions. Costa Rica was, in theory, just a tropical paradise with low taxes and minimal government interference\u2014an ideal habitat for a pair of pioneering tech nerds. Neither Budovsky nor Kats spoke Spanish fluently, though, so they teamed up with a local named Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani, who oversaw the day-to-day operations of Liberty Reserve. Abdelghani was a naturalized Costa Rican citizen originally from Morocco. According to several people who knew him well\u2014including Budovsky\u2014he was temperamental, violent, and prone to heavy drinking. One former employee told me that Abdelghani often walked around the office brandishing a blackjack and that he once threatened to kill a man for failing to deliver some company uniforms on time. (Abdelghani is at large in Costa Rica and could not be reached for comment.) By 2010, Liberty Reserve was gaining tens of thousands of new accounts each month. The company soon looked the part of a successful tech start-up. It had more than 50 employees in departments including human resources, accounting, marketing, and legal, and provided around-the-clock customer service and technical support. Liberty Reserve\u2019s headquarters were in the same office park in San Jos\u00e9, the capital, as branches of Hewlett-Packard, Procter & Gamble, and Western Union. The company housed its servers in the Netherlands and employed programmers in Ukraine. Its customers, of course, were everywhere. The element of surprise would be crucial: authorities needed to act before the main players had a chance to take their money and run. At least some users were legitimate businesspeople. One of them was Mitchell Rossetti, an entrepreneur based in Texas whose company, ePay-Cards.com, sells prepaid credit cards with small balances to customers around the world. Many of his customers couldn\u2019t use PayPal, because they didn\u2019t have bank accounts or credit cards, and he didn\u2019t like that PayPal would let people dispute a charge after they\u2019d bought one of his cards. PayPal would demand a refund, and Rossetti would be out the money. \u201cThis is why we went to Liberty Reserve,\u201d he told me. \u201cAll payments were final.\u201d He also appreciated the multiple layers of encryption anytime he logged in. \u201cIt was very well thought-out.\u201d\n\nEven as Liberty Reserve grew into a thriving tech company, Budovsky was furtive about his involvement. \u201cArthur was never to be mentioned in public or referred to as a person that belonged to the company,\u201d a former employee told me. \u201cWe were asked to call him Eric Paltz. That was his business name. Even his business cards would say Eric.\u201d Budovsky told me he used that pseudonym only in e\u2011mails, and that others at Liberty Reserve used it too. But he added that his own name was a liability for the company. In the wake of the GoldAge debacle, the Associated Press had described him as a money launderer. (He was convicted only of transmitting money without a license.) As a result, he says, he had to distance himself from the company. And he did. Budovsky says he sold Liberty Reserve to Abdelghani soon after the company launched, and that he then worked for the company as a contractor, helping to make the networks run. U.S. investigators would later allege that Budovsky always controlled Liberty Reserve, and that he used surrogates to open bank accounts or file corporate paperwork. Budovsky told me he simply wanted to avoid the tiresome burdens of ownership. \u201cI like to create and sell,\u201d he said. \u201cOffice jobs are not for me.\u201d Whatever his intentions were, the practical effect was that he had no real legal ties to the company. On paper, at least, he was just another tech contractor.\n\nFor Budovsky, life in Costa Rica was good. He worked long hours and says he never went to the beach, because of a \u201cskin condition\u201d\u2014his mother had had skin cancer and he feared the sun. But he liked cars, and his collection came to include a Jaguar and a Mercedes. He lived in a spacious home in the hills outside of San Jos\u00e9 and hired a maid who also prepared his meals. He liked photography and art, and on one occasion, he attended a charity auction\u2014known as the CowParade\u2014where life-size statues of cows sold for as much as $7,500 apiece. He bought three of them to decorate his house.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent Vladimir Kats shared in Liberty Reserve\u2019s profits. Budovsky says that Kats never came to Costa Rica or contributed to the company in any meaningful way. In 2009, Kats and Budovsky had a falling-out, and Budovsky says that he gave his old friend a six-figure gift\u2014a kind of unofficial severance\u2014and that after this, Kats had nothing to do with Liberty Reserve. (Kats\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.) When he wasn\u2019t working, Budovsky occasionally spent time with a Costa Rican woman named Yesenia Valeria Vargas. Vargas, who was in her mid-30s, supported herself and her three young daughters by selling empanadas at a food stand in front of an immigration office. She told me she and Budovsky were introduced early in 2008 by one of her regular customers, who happened to be an immigration lawyer. \u201cHe said to me that he had a man who wanted to marry me.\u201d In the months following their introduction, they went on dates. Communication must have been difficult, because Vargas doesn\u2019t speak any English and Budovsky doesn\u2019t speak much Spanish, but apparently they managed. As she told me in Spanish, through a translator: \u201cIn the time when we were going out, as friends, he explained to me his situation and told me he wanted to stay in Costa Rica, and so he wanted to marry. I said yes. We were in love.\u201d They wed in June 2008. Vargas described her husband as \u201ca gentleman\u201d in every way. Each month, he sent her 200,000 colones\u2014roughly $380\u2014to help support her. Given how they met, I asked her whether they had a romantic relationship. \u201cYes, we had sexual relations, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking me,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, of course, that is what is expected of a married woman.\u201d But while Budovsky claims Vargas and her children lived with him, she said that in all their time together, she never even set foot in his house. Instead, she said, they met at hotels.\n\nVargas gleaned very little about Budovsky\u2019s past or what he did for work. \u201cHe was very reserved about his personal matters,\u201d she said. Among the things Budovsky never told her was that a couple of years after they wed, he also married a Dutch man named Gleb Pavlukhin, with whom he shared a home in Holland, where Liberty Reserve\u2019s servers were housed. Here again, Budovsky\u2019s and Vargas\u2019s accounts diverge: he says he divorced her before marrying Pavlukhin, but there is no record of the divorce in Costa Rica, and Vargas told me that as far as she knows, they\u2019re still married. Budovsky insists he didn\u2019t marry Vargas simply to get Costa Rican citizenship, which would have been illegal. Theirs was a personal relationship, he told me, without elaboration. But becoming a full-fledged Costa Rican did offer Budovsky a certain measure of protection from the U.S. government, as Costa Rica\u2019s constitution bans the extradition of its citizens. (Though there are exceptions to this rule, they are extremely rare.) In 2011, Budovsky severed his ties with the United States altogether by renouncing his citizenship. According to government reports, he told U.S. immigration officials that he was developing new \u201csoftware\u201d that \u201cmight open him up to liability in the U.S.\u201d Budovsky claims that Liberty Reserve always planned to operate according to the local laws. He points to the fact that in 2008 the company began the process of applying for a money-transmitting license from Costa Rica\u2019s financial regulatory agency, known as SUGEF. To ensure that this process went smoothly, the company hired a respected Costa Rican banker, Marco Cubero, as its general manager.\n\nCubero, in turn, hired an anti-money-laundering compliance officer named Sylvia Lopez\u2014an experienced banking official. This was a SUGEF requirement. Perhaps the most important requirement, however, was that Liberty Reserve had to create a Government Administrative Area, or GAA, within the company\u2019s computer system. This was, in essence, a window into the company\u2019s inner workings, a way for Lopez to monitor transactions so she could report suspicious activity to the government. Liberty Reserve did create a GAA, but it was hardly a model of transparency. In June 2010, one of Liberty Reserve\u2019s tech experts sent an e-mail, in Russian, to several people in the company, including Budovsky, about how the GAA would work. The system would allow the Costa Rican government to \u201cview a few statistics,\u201d the e-mail said, but the \u201cmajority of these statistics are going to be fake.\u201d (This e-mail was later captured by U.S. investigators. Budovsky claims it was mistranslated.) It appears that neither Cubero nor Lopez knew about these fake statistics. According to U.S. investigators, Cubero resigned from Liberty Reserve in March 2011, in part because Budovsky hadn\u2019t given him access to the company\u2019s complete database. Lopez went further, reporting the company for suspicious activity. Budovsky admits that the GAA didn\u2019t reveal a completely accurate picture of the company\u2019s finances, but he has an explanation: taxes. \u201cThe only thing that was changed was the total revenue for Liberty Reserve,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe showed that we were making more money from Costa Rican accounts than we actually did. It was easier for the books and for Victor, the accountant.\u201d\n\nLiberty Reserve\u2019s troubles with Cubero and Lopez were soon compounded by a more serious problem. Budovsky told me that in early 2011, a Dutch policeman visited the company that hosted Liberty Reserve\u2019s servers in the Netherlands. Budovsky says he heard that the policeman claimed to be assisting in a U.S. investigation. According to Budovsky, Liberty Reserve then hired a private detective in the United States to find out whether the company was, in fact, under investigation by a federal agency. The detective reported that he could find no proof of this. Soon after, Liberty Reserve moved its servers from Holland to Costa Rica\u2014a cost-saving measure, Budovsky says. The private investigator, it turns out, didn\u2019t do a very good job. Back in the U.S., a major federal investigation was indeed under way. On November 18, 2011, the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network sent out a notice to its member financial institutions, warning them that Liberty Reserve was \u201ccurrently being used by criminals to conduct anonymous transactions to move money globally.\u201d Budovsky says he never saw this notice. But government investigators believe he did. They say it is no coincidence that just 10 days later, Liberty Reserve aborted its efforts to get a Costa Rican money-transmitting license. The company\u2019s new general manager wrote a letter to the authorities explaining that Liberty Reserve was being sold to a buyer in Europe and would cease its business activities in Costa Rica.\n\nBudovsky told me that the buyer was in Cyprus\u2014another country with lax banking laws. In 2013, when the European Union was debating whether or not to bail out the Cypriot government, many EU members objected. As The Wall Street Journal reported at the time, \u201cThe little island won\u2019t get a cent until it wrestles with a long-standing issue: money laundering.\u201d\n\nLittle did Budovsky realize, but the Secret Service had been keeping an eye on Liberty Reserve since at least 2010. As part of its investigation, agents tested just how carefully Liberty Reserve vetted its users. An agent tried opening an account with the name \u201cJoe Bogus\u201d and an address of \u201c123 Fake Main Street\u201d in \u201cCompletely Made Up City.\u201d The agent also named the account \u201cToStealEverything\u201d and wrote that it would be used for \u201cshady things.\u201d He encountered no problems, and the account was soon functional. By 2011, a Secret Service agent who was a member of the multiagency Global Illicit Financial Team (GIFT) had suggested that Liberty Reserve would make a good target for the group. GIFT was created to investigate multinational financial-crime cases, especially those involving organized-crime syndicates. The team draws its members from the Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division. The group soon set its sights on Liberty Reserve.\n\nBy the government\u2019s assessment, the Liberty Reserve investigation is one of the largest money-laundering probes ever conducted. Classic money-laundering schemes involve businesses that run largely on cash\u2014tanning salons, car washes, casinos\u2014where the dirty money simply mixes in with the clean. In the age of global finance, though, money laundering typically involves shell companies and offshore bank accounts. Liberty Reserve appeared to be a key component in the process\u2014a conduit for criminals to move money across borders without leaving a trace. In going after Liberty Reserve, the element of surprise would be crucial: authorities needed to act before the main players had a chance to take their money and run. Even more important, authorities would need to seize Liberty Reserve\u2019s servers before anyone could destroy the data they held. The servers were the holy grail. They contained information on all 1 million users and their 5.1 million accounts\u2014evidence that might incriminate not just those running Liberty Reserve but any criminals who used the system. Such sensitive information can often be sabotaged remotely, with the click of a button. The GIFT investigation revealed that Liberty Reserve had never shut down in Costa Rica. Instead, it had continued operating with a pared-down staff in office space also used by another company Budovsky owned. But apparently an exit plan was under way. According to U.S. investigators, Budovsky and his associates had begun emptying the company\u2019s bank accounts in Costa Rica, transferring millions of dollars first to a shell account in Cyprus and then to another one in Russia. Ultimately, U.S. officials believe, Budovsky dispersed Liberty Reserve funds into more than two dozen bank accounts in Hong Kong, China, Morocco, Australia, and Spain. At the urging of the United States, Costa Rican officials seized roughly $20 million of Liberty Reserve\u2019s money.\n\nBudovsky denies that he was trying to drain the company\u2019s coffers; he says the funds were wired to Cyprus because the company was transferring assets to its new owner. What\u2019s more, he says, Liberty Reserve\u2019s move to Cyprus was delayed precisely because so much of its money had been seized. In any case, Budovsky remained safe from U.S. authorities as long as he stayed in Costa Rica. But, as one U.S. investigator told me, officials simply had to be patient. \u201cEveryone travels,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially if they have money.\u201d Budovsky, in fact, traveled all the time. He had two other tech businesses\u2014one specializing in IT services and the other in encryption\u2014that were based in Europe and required his presence. But it was a vacation, a 10\u2011day trip to Morocco in May 2013, that led to his undoing. He had a layover in Madrid on his way home. As soon as the plane landed, Budovsky told me, \u201cI saw cars and agents outside the plane window.\u201d Minutes later, Budovsky says, he was answering questions from two American law-enforcement officials. \u201cThey told me that the case against me was big and\u2014if I would talk\u2014some people from the United States would fly here. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll talk, but I will need legal counsel to be present.\u2019 They said, \u2018I guess you are not serious.\u2019 They tried this twice more on the tarmac.\u201d He was then taken to a prison by Spanish authorities. Among the items he was carrying, authorities would later discover several debit cards that were linked to bank accounts in Cyprus containing roughly $3.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities apprehended other Liberty Reserve associates, including Vladimir Kats, who was arrested in Brooklyn. A team of U.S. and Costa Rican officials raided Budovsky\u2019s home and Liberty Reserve\u2019s offices, seizing all of the company\u2019s files and computers. Another team surprised Budovsky\u2019s husband, Gleb Pavlukhin, at home in Holland. \u201cThey entered my house with an enormous battering ram and 12 detectives,\u201d Pavlukhin told the Dutch press. U.S. authorities seized the domain name for Liberty Reserve and redirected it to an IP address belonging to the Shadowserver Foundation. Liberty Reserve\u2019s home page became the blank screen that puzzled and panicked the carders. Shadowserver, it turns out, often works with law-enforcement agencies around the world. Liberty Reserve users were so enraged by Shadowserver\u2019s participation that one of them launched a cyberattack that took down the organization\u2019s Web site. The arrests occurred on May 24, 2013, the Friday before Memorial Day. Over the next three days, there was little news of what had happened. Liberty Reserve users fretted, despaired, and hypothesized. Then, on Tuesday, Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, called a press conference. \u201cToday, we announce charges in what may be the largest international money-laundering case ever brought by the United States \u2026 allegedly [involving] a staggering $6 billion in criminal proceeds,\u201d he said. Bharara unveiled a lengthy indictment against Budovsky, Kats, Abdelghani, and several other current and former Liberty Reserve employees. He called Liberty Reserve \u201cthe bank of choice for the criminal underworld.\u201d", "description": "Liberty Reserve was like PayPal for the unbanked.
