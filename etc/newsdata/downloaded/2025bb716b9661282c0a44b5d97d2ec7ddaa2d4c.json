This doesn't come as a huge surprise considering the plethora of cheap Spain holidays on offer.\n\nAlthough bookings to Spain for summer 2019 were slightly down on last year, it still shows no sign of getting knocked off the top spot, as the report revealed that out of Brits planning trips abroad next year, Spain was once again proving the top choice.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe USA came second as the country Brits planned to visit in 2020, followed by France.\n\nAlthough hotspots abroad are still top of the list, that's not to say a staycation won't be on the cards.\n\nIn fact, over half of Brits surveyed said they intended to travel in the UK next year.\n\nThat comes after 72 per cent of people took a UK holiday in the last 12 months, a small growth compared to the previous year.\n\nRead More Beach Holidays UK\n\nEurope\n\nSpain\n\nSri Lanka\n\nAccording to ABTA Members, popular locations include Norfolk, The Lake District, Devon, Cornwall and Bournemouth.\n\nHowever, there is a growing trend in Brits opting to go globetrotting, with long-haul getting increasingly popular.\n\nDestinations such as Asia, North America, the Caribbean have all seen increases in visits from Brits, which the organisation attributes to the large range of affordable flights allowing Brits to explore places further afield.", "description": "Europe has proven to be Brits' top choice for holidays and it looks set to hold the top spot for 2020", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14102134.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_father-with-son-and-daughter-walking-at-beach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
