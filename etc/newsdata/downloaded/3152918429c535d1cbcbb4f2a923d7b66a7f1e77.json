The increasing number of new homes proposed on the Green Belt has continued to rise since the report was first undertaken in 2012, despite the fact that these homes are not delivering promised affordable housing. We must not allow our Green Belt to be gobbled up, but instead focus on building affordable homes in which young struggling families can actually live.\"", "description": "Only one in ten homes built on green belt land are affordable, a new report by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) has found.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Jane Shilling", "Iain Duncan Smith", "Max Hill Qc", "Nick Timothy", "John Penrose"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000094920730-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
