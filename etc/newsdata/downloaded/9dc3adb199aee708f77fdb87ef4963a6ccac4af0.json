(Kin Cheun/Associated Press)\n\nOne of the five demands \u2014 to formally withdraw the extradition bill \u2014 was announced last week by the city government leader, Carrie Lam, but protesters are angry about her failure to call an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality during demonstrations.\n\nThe protesters' other demands include the retraction of the word \"riot\" to describe demonstrations, the release of all those arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\nIn a rare public appearance, Lam walked around the central business district inspecting the damaged MTR station, where she chatted with staff and commuters.\n\nDressed in a black suit, she examined electronic ticketing machines and boarded up windows smashed a day earlier, the public broadcaster RTHK showed.\n\nGovernment warns against foreign interference\n\nFollowing the demonstration at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, Hong Kong's government warned foreign lawmakers not to interfere in the internal affairs of the former British colony after thousands of protesters called on U.S. President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" the city.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling in the city's affairs and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and the U.K. of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nChinese state media on Monday said Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China and any form of secessionism \"will be crushed.\"\n\nThe China Daily newspaper said Sunday's rally was proof foreign forces were behind the protests and warned demonstrators should \"stop trying the patience of the central government.\"\n\nYoung pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was released from police custody on Monday after breaching bail conditions following his arrest in August when he was charged along with a number of other prominent activists for inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was monitoring events in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong, and those freedoms must be vigorously protected.
