WWE\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a full night of action at Clash of Champions. Here\u2019s our handy guide of everything you need to know about the evening that sees all the company\u2019s marquee titles on the line:\n\nWhen is Clash of Champions?\n\nClash of Champions takes place on Sunday 15th September. The main part of the show gets underway at midnight (BST), but the \u2018pre-show\u2019 begins at 11pm \u2013 this hour-long feature usually involves at least one match in addition to all the build-up and panel-based chatter.\n\nWhere can I watch?\n\nSky Sports are showing the event on Sky Sports Box Office. You can order and watch it live, but \u2013 in addition \u2013 Clash of Champions is repeated from 6am on Monday all the way through to 9pm on Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, you can subscribe to WWE\u2019s in-house service, WWE Network, which will air the event as it happens and almost immediately on demand afterwards, indefinitely.\n\nYou can view WWE Network on most smartphones and devices, including PS4, Xbox 360 or Xbox One and the vast majority of connected smart televisions.\n\nIf you have a PS3 or some older generations of iPads, be aware that WWE Network no longer functions on these platforms.\n\nHow much will it cost to watch?\n\nThat depends on which method you chose. Sky Sports Box Office are charging \u00a314.95 for their airings, while WWE Network subscriptions are a cheaper at \u00a39.99 per month.\n\nCan you stream it online for free?\n\nYes, and it\u2019s entirely legal! WWE Network is actually free of charge for new subscribers.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a first-time subscriber, head over to wwe.com before Sunday\u2019s show and sign up. That will give you a month\u2019s access for free, which will include not only this show, but also any other WWE content and events for the month.\n\nWhere is it being held?\n\nClash of Champions takes place in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the Spectrum Centre. The venue can accommodate around 20,000 fans for wrestling events, but it is unlikely that Sunday\u2019s event will fetch close to that number.\n\nThough the venue has hosted plenty of WWE broadcasts, only one pay-per-view event has been held there, that being Vengeance some 13 years ago.\n\nWhat are the stand-out bouts?\n\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, Seth Rollins and Braun Strowman are expected to dominate the show, with their Universal Championship bout the most likely candidate to end the event.\n\nMeanwhile, Kofi Kingston continues to reign as WWE Champion, having won the gold back in spring at Wrestlemania. He\u2019s once again up against Randy Orton on Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s also a busy night for WWE\u2019s top women, with both the Raw and SmackDown Women\u2019s Championships on the line. Becky Lynch, Raw Women\u2019s Champion, defends her gold against the returning Sasha Banks, while SmackDown\u2019s Champion, Bayley, meets Charlotte Flair.\n\nWhat is the full card for Clash of Champions?\n\nHere is the night\u2019s full line-up:\n\nUniversal Championship: Seth Rollins (c) vs. Braun Strowman\n\nWWE Championship: Kofi Kingston (c) vs. Randy Orton\n\nRaw Women\u2019s Championship: Becky Lynch (c) vs. Sasha Banks\n\nSmackDown Women\u2019s Championship: Bayley (c) vs. Charlotte Flair\n\nIntercontinental Championship: Shinsuke Nakamura (c) vs. The Miz\n\nUnited States Championship: AJ Styles (c) vs. Cedric Alexander\n\nRaw Tag Team Championship: Seth Rollins and Braun Strowman (c) vs. Dolph Ziggler & Robert Roode\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Championship: The New Day (c) vs. The Revival\n\nWomen\u2019s Tag Team Championship: Alexa Bliss & Nikki Cross (c) vs. Mandy Rose & Sonya Deville\n\nCruiserweight Championship: Drew Gulak (c) vs. Humberto Carrillo vs. Lince Dorado\n\nNo Disqualification match: Roman Reigns vs. Rowan", "description": "Seth Rollins must pull double duty as he looks to defend two titles at WWE Clash of Champions on Sunday.
