Sounds impressive!\n\nThe boys exchanged words as they announced the news online, with Geordie Shore star Scott writing: \u2018So the news is finally out, me and @stevie_bear are going to be having a good old fashioned tear up on 14TH December at the Utilita arena in my hometown of Newcastle!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Which sexy f***er do you think is going to win!??\u2019\n\nNow there\u2019s a question, eh Scott?\n\nCelebrity Big Brother star Stevie wrote back: \u2018So me and @scottgshore are having a dust up in the ring\u2026 not boxing \u2026 MMA.\u2019\n\nCould that be a dig at two certain YouTubers and their boxing match? Who would win in the battle of MMA vs. boxing?\n\nMock as Stevie may, the success of FAME MMA UK is hoping to build off the success of Youtubers Logan Paul and KSI\u2019s infamous boxing match, which more than 1.6 million people watched live last summer.\n\nWith a rematch taking place on 9 November, the pair have been mouthing off at press conferences across the world (with words that make Scotty and Stevie seem like polite little puppies), with KSI predicting last week that he\u2019d knock his opponent out by the fifth round.\n\nYoutubers, confident? Never.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
