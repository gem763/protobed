Only for the brother side of it. Not a bit about Oasis.\n\n\u2018The most important thing is about me and him being brothers. I\u2019ve got another brother who he doesn\u2019t speak to. It would be nice if all three of us would be together. Obviously, our mum is still alive, so she gets upset about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He thinks I\u2019m desperate to get the band back together for money. But I didn\u2019t join the band to make money. I joined the band to have fun and to see the world.\u2019\n\nSo far both brothers have resisted calls from fans to reform.\n\nNoel, 52, has released under his High Flying Birds moniker while Liam, 47, has recorded two solo albums under his own name.\n\nSo far both brothers have resisted calls from fans to reform (Picture: Rex)\n\nLiam also said he hoped his brother could \u2018get off whatever\u2019s on his chest\u2019 so they could reform for their fans.\n\nAsked what would have to happen for Oasis to return, he said: \u2018For him to come to my house, get on his knees and beg for mercy and say \u201csorry\u201d. Maybe bring me a cake with a little candle on it. I\u2019m only joking. Just for me and him to go for a beer.\n\n\u2018Shoot some shit and get off whatever\u2019s on his chest off because I don\u2019t think we should have split up over a big argument. I mean, I didn\u2019t kick his cat. I didn\u2019t try hugging up with his Mrs or anything like that. I don\u2019t know what his problem is.\n\n\u2018I think he just wanted to go away and do his solo career, get all the coin and be surrounded by all the yes men you can fire and hire whenever he wants. You can\u2019t do that with me.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
