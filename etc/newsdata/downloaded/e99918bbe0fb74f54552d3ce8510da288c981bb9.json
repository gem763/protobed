Here's a look at the their record through the first four games of the last eight campaigns (including 2019):\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n2019: 4-0\n\n2018: 2-2\n\n2017: 2-2\n\n2016: 3-1\n\n2015: 4-0\n\n2014: 2-2\n\n2013: 4-0\n\n2012: 2-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady was asked Wednesday during an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio if there's anything different about the team this season that's leading to the fast start.\n\n\"Our defense has given us, I think, that ability (to start fast this season), because the way they've been playing,\" Brady said. \"They've been playing that way all the way back into the spring. They're just doing a great job. They have a lot of great continuity. The secondary -- look how long they've played together. The group of linebackers -- look how long they've played together. What they're doing to get to the quarterback, and they have such a good mix of players who can rush and cover.\n\n\"We've been gettng ahead of teams. Our defense has really been thriving -- leading the league in turnovers, leading the league in sacks, what they've been doing on third downs has been incredible. I think they've just been playing so spectacular that it's given our team a huge boost.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Patriots defense is off to a historic start. The unit has allowed the fewest points per game (8.0) and yards per game (234.7) of any team through the first six weeks. The pass rush also has been tremendous, and as Brady noted, the defense leads the league in sacks and turnovers (including a league-high 14 interceptions). The Patriots' point differential of plus-142 is the best in the league, and well ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (plus-83) in second place.\n\nNew England's fast start has allowed it to build an early lead in the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. The Patriots fell short of this goal last season, even though it ultimately didn't matter after they beat the Kansas City Chiefs on the road in the AFC Championship Game. But the Patriots should absolutely chase that seed this season because they are almost unbeatable at home. In fact, they've won 19 consecutive games at Gillette Stadium, including the playoffs.\n\nThe Patriots' fast start in 2019 should go a long way in ensuring the road to Super Bowl LIV in Miami goes down Route 1 in Foxboro.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
