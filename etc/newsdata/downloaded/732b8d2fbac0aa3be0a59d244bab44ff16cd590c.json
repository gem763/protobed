There\u2019s a movement toward \u201cNo-Tech Sundays,\u201d where participants abandon their tech for the day. Resorts, start-ups and wellness gurus are cashing in on the unplugged travel trend with a variety of digital detox events.\n\nAD\n\nThere is even a \u201cNational Day of Unplugging.\u201d\n\nThe Paper Phone project is one of Google\u2019s open-source experiments that also includes a phone wallpaper that counts how many times a day a user unlocks their device, and a \u201cdesert island\u201d program that gives users access to only their most essential apps for 24 hours.\n\n\u201cWe hope these experiments inspire developers and designers to keep digital well-being top of mind when building technology,\u201d Google Creative Lab team lead Emma Turpin wrote in a blog post Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nSome of the movement to unplug stems from research around the effects of tech on our health. The World Health Organization released new screen time guidelines for parents earlier this year based on research that found behavioral and developmental issues in children who spent hours in front of a screen. Other research has found connections between smartphone usage and anxiety.\n\nAD\n\nTanya Goodin, a London-based digital well-being evangelist, says Google\u2019s project reminds her of when Big Tobacco targeted consumers concerned about their health with low-tar cigarettes to keep them as customers.\n\n\u201cInstead of children\u2019s games, they have to look seriously at the fact that we\u2019ve been rats in this big Silicon Valley experiment,\u201d said Goodin. \u201cThe fact that we can\u2019t disengage from technology is exactly because of the things these companies have been doing for years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFormer Google design ethicist Tristan Harris launched a tech ethics nonprofit originally called Time Well Spent and now known as the Center for Humane Technology. Harris has argued that the tech industry is engaged in a \u201crace to the bottom of the brain stem,\u201d and that tech design should enhance \u2014 not endanger \u2014 humanity. The \u201ctime well spent\u201d concept has been widely referenced by Silicon Valley executives, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nAD\n\nZuckerberg said at a company event Friday that he has told his team to optimize meaningful interactions between users on the platform, rather than maximizing spending time on it, according to a tweet from Flipboard editor Ken Yeung.\n\nZuckerberg said that he\u2019s prohibited the Facebook Feed team from optimizing the feed to maximize time spent. Instead, it\u2019s about facilitating meaningful interactions. Says it\u2019s one of the most misunderstood things Facebook does. \u2014 Ken Yeung (@thekenyeung) October 25, 2019\n\nPaper Phone isn\u2019t Google\u2019s first attempt at using paper products to explore the digital world. In 2014, the company introduced Google Cardboard, a way to view virtual reality applications on a smartphone. Google said it shipped 5 million pairs of the low-tech glasses in 19 months.\n\nAnthony Martinez, a cyber-navigator at the Chicago Public Library, tweeted his approval of Google\u2019s most recent foray into the two-dimensional world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all about minimalism and this is fantastic and feels like an art project in just the right way,\u201d he said.\n\nI'm all about minimalism and this is fantastic and feels like an art project in just the right way. #PaperPhone #DigitalDetox #miminalism https://t.co/5qlVyWVNLn \u2014 ANT (@RoboAnt) October 25, 2019\n\nAD", "description": "The company says the experiment is aimed at giving users a \u201cdigital detox.\u201d", "authors": ["Marie C.
