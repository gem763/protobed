And in Japan right now, that has moved rugby from the sidelines into the mainstream.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, Japan\u2019s victory over Scotland was for a nation, not just rugby,\u201d World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont said of Japan\u2019s progress into the World Cup quarterfinals at the end of a weekend when a destructive typhoon hit the tournament\u2019s host country and left dozens dead.\n\nThe first Rugby World Cup staged in Asia is being hailed as a success even before kickoff in the knockout rounds. The tournament is three weekends down, and three to go.\n\n\u201cNever has a nation been so unified behind a (Rugby World Cup) tournament and never have we seen so many people greeting the teams at training sessions, hotels and public events,\u201d Beaumont said as he reviewed the 40-game group stage that began with Japan beating Russia in Tokyo on Sept. 20.\n\nWorld Rugby said more than 1.8 million tickets had been sold across all 48 matches, with another 864,000 fans attending dedicated fan zones set up in the major cities.\n\nBroadcast figures have also surpassed expectations with a live peak television audience in Japan of an estimated 50 million tuning in to local Japanese network NHK\u2019s broadcast of the hosts thrilling 28-21 victory over Scotland at Yokohama to secure Japan\u2019s first-ever quarterfinal place last Sunday night.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday and left devastation in parts of the country, and forced the first ever cancellation of games - two on Saturday, and one on Sunday - at rugby\u2019s showpiece event.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with those who have been affected by Typhoon Hagibis,\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cWe stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan.\n\n\u201cWe owe a huge debt of gratitude to our friends in the Japan 2019 organizing committee, in the host cities, match venues and the brilliant staff and volunteers working in the most difficult circumstances to make Sunday\u2019s matches happen for the teams and our remarkable fans, who have shown such understanding.\u201d\n\nDespite the best efforts of local organizers to prepare the stadiums in the aftermath of the typhoon, the match between Canada and Namibia in the city of Kamaishi was canceled at 6 a.m. local time on Sunday.\n\nEncapsulating the spirit of the tournament and providing perhaps one of its most enduring images was the sight of both teams helping the local community with the clean-up effort. The Canadian players and support staff swept and shoveled debris on a day when they\u2019d been expecting to finish off their tournament, hoping to give something back to the people who\u2019d been hosting them along the way.\n\nBaseball, soccer and sumo are sports that have the biggest following in Japan, although rugby has a long history in the country, a healthy domestic competition and seemingly a growing popularity.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese people are the heartbeat of the tournament and have welcomed the teams and fans with open arms,\u201d Beaumont said in a statement. \u201cFrom full and vibrant stadiums and fan zones, to record social media, the fans, teams and the people of Japan have shared truly unforgettable moments of friendship, celebration and hospitality.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Everyone loves a winner.
