Many chanted, \u201cFive demands! Not one less!,\u201d \u201cFight for freedom!\u201d and \u201cRevolution of our times!\u201d\n\nA 15th straight Sunday of demonstrations came after a day of localized clashes Saturday, a public holiday, between pro-democracy protesters and groups supporting the government inside shopping malls around the city, with police making some arrests.\n\nThe scale of the crowds Sunday evoked mass marches earlier this summer, suggesting efforts by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to weaken and divide the opposition movement are having little effect, and the crisis remains a challenge for the Chinese leadership in Beijing. Mrs. Lam on Sept. 4 withdrew an extradition bill that sparked the summer of unrest and pledged to start dialogue with the community.\n\nThe leader urged society not to support hard-core protesters who have used violent tactics. She promised to crack down hard on lawbreakers, while police banned Sunday\u2019s proposed peaceful rally, citing the risk of violence breaking out as has happened in earlier weekends.\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, which had proposed the rally, has organized three earlier marches that it estimates drew at least a million each time.\n\nThe massive social unrest combined with the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing Chinese growth are threatening to tip Hong Kong\u2019s economy into recession, officials have warned. Violent protests have disrupted flight services and road transportation, putting a dent in the city\u2019s image as a safe city and an international financial hub.\n\nOn Sunday, the city\u2019s airport authority said passenger volume dropped 12.4% in August from a year ago, mainly due to significant declines in traffic to and from mainland China, Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Overall tourist arrivals fell 40% last month from a year earlier, the worst decline since May 2003, when Hong Kong was grappling with the deadly SARS virus.\n\nEarly Sunday afternoon, tens of thousands of protesters streamed down major streets heading toward Central, with some of them holding big U.S. flags and carrying a banner reading: \u201cPresident Trump Please Liberate Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSome protesters carried American flags, and a sign calling on U.S. President Donald Trump to \u201cliberate Hong Kong.\u201d Photo: Vincent Yu/Associated Press\n\nMany in the crowd sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d a new anthem of the protest movement.\n\nSome protesters brought their families despite the fact that the march was declared illegal.\n\n\u201cWe hope our children have a future, because now in Hong Kong, we cannot see any hope,\u201d said Charis, 30, who had her 7-month old daughter strapped to her front. \u201cWe need to stand here, we need to walk here. We need to tell government, we need five demands, not one less,\u201d she added.\n\nProtesters\u2019 five demands include an inquiry into allegations of police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters and electoral reforms to allow Hongkongers to vote for their leaders. Only one, the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to China, has been met.\n\nThe fact that large numbers turned out for Sunday\u2019s March, including many families and elderly residents, suggest that many in Hong Kong believe that their government\u2019s response so far isn\u2019t sincere, said Mr. Law, a 49-year-old who works at a nonprofit focused on engaging youth and who declined to give his first name.\n\n\u201cWhat they have done so far is window dressing,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cThey just want to show the rest of the world that they are doing something. But we Hong Kong people understand that they are not doing what we want.\u201d\n\nMr. Law, who like many other protesters didn\u2019t wear a mask to veil his face, said he wasn\u2019t worried that he might be identified by the authorities. \u201cThere are so many others like me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the government\u2019s permission to take to the streets.\u201d\n\n\u2014Chun Han Wong contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joanne Chiu at joanne.chiu@wsj.com and Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "description": "Political turmoil engulfing the global financial center showed no signs of abating Sunday as tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators marched through the streets in defiance of a police ban on the protest.", "authors": ["Joanne Chiu", "Mike Cherney", "Joanne.Chiu Wsj.Com", "Mike.Cherney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107252/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
