Elizabeth Warren said she\u2019ll fill in more details on how to pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health insurance proposal in the coming weeks, amid pressure from her 2020 Democratic presidential rivals to say whether middle-class taxes would have to go up under her plan.\n\n\u201cWhat I see \u2026 is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of Medicare for All, and specifically how we pay for it,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said at an event in Iowa on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been working on for months and months, and it\u2019s got just a little more work until it\u2019s finished,\u201d the senator said.\n\nShe vowed that she would not sign a bill into law that does not reduce the cost of health care for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d families.\n\nBut Ms. Warren has been more evasive when faced with questions on whether tax hikes on the middle class would be necessary to pay for the plan.\n\nSeveral of her 2020 Democratic presidential rivals, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have pressed her on that point recently.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
