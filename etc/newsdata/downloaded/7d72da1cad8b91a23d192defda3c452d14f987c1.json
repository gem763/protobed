REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nTensions between separatists in the region and Madrid have run high in recent days after Spain\u2019s high court sent seven Catalan separatist activists to jail, which was followed by the regional parliament adopting a resolution backing civil disobedience.\n\nThe protests will provide a measure of the strength of Catalan separatism, which has posed a major challenge for Spain for years and triggered its biggest political crisis in decades in 2017 when the region briefly declared independence.\n\nThe separatist movement has so far been peaceful, but this has been put in question by the arrest last week of the seven activists, alleged to be linked with the grassroots CDR protest movement and accused of preparing violent actions.\n\nThe Oct. 1 anniversary protests come before the verdict, expected in the next two weeks, of separatist leaders arrested in 2017 over their role in the region\u2019s failed independence bid.\n\nThe botched declaration of independence, which was followed by Madrid sidelining regional authorities and ruling Catalonia directly for months, still dominates national politics.\n\nActing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday that Madrid would not hesitate to apply direct rule to Catalonia again if the regional government broke any laws.\n\n\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t arrive to that point,\u201d Sanchez said in an interview with broadcaster Cadena Ser.\n\nSeparatist leaders have so far refused to condemn the seven activists arrested last week over what prosecutors say were plans for violent actions, saying instead that authorities in Madrid were trying to paint separatists as a violent movement, a label they reject.\n\n\u201cNON-VIOLENT RESISTANCE\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only one way (to achieve independence) ... that is of civic, non-violent resistance,\u201d the former head of the Catalan region, Carles Puigdemont, told Catalan public radio on Tuesday.\n\nBut national political leaders in Madrid insist Catalan separatist politicians must condemn those who were arrested.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Catalan independence movement not to play with fire, not to make the worst possible mistake, which is to look the other way if there are signs of violence, as we have unfortunately seen in recent weeks,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nPolice had cordoned off the train station and other key buildings in Girona, a small town at the heart of the independence movement.\n\nThe Girona protest, attended by around 150 people, was organised by the Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), among other entities. They have staged periodic protests since separatist leaders were arrested after the October 2017 referendum and short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nSeparatists are at a crossroads, and are divided over what course to take - a hard line that could lead to another banned independence referendum or more dialogue with Madrid.\n\n\u201cWE WILL WIN\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were born to defend a referendum. We grew to defend a republic. We will be who will make the enemy tremble. And we will win. Have no doubts,\u201d the CDRs said on a manifesto on the referendum anniversary posted on Twitter.\n\nPolice did not make any arrests in Girona but asked one person for its identification after that person threw paint to some officers, a Catalan police spokesperson said, adding that security had been strengthened around the town\u2019s train station and other official buildings.\n\nMore events are planned on Tuesday, including a rally in the evening in Barcelona, where police also beefed up their presence in the city\u2019s main train station.\n\nSpeaking on the eve of the anniversary, Catalonia\u2019s regional president Quim Torra described Oct. 1 as the beginning of \u201cthe irrepressible journey towards a Catalan republic.\u201d\n\nAsked about Sanchez\u2019s comments on the possibility of fresh direct rule from Madrid in Catalonia, Torra\u2019s predecessor Puigdemont, who lives in self-imposed exile in Belgium, said there was no reason for such a move and attributed the comments to political posturing ahead of Nov.10 parliamentary election.\n\nAn annual pro-independence rally in Barcelona gathered fewer people that usual last month. Organisers said this had been the \u201chardest\u201d secessionist protest to put together since they started in 2012, because of divisions among the separatist parties and the lack of a clear road map for independence.", "description": "Protesters gathered in Girona on Tuesday to mark the second anniversary of a banned Catalan independence vote, some hurling eggs at police and toppling garbage bins, amid a hardening political atmosphere around Spain's most polarising issue.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435843387&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902IU", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
