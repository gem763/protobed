They\u2019ll be powered by several of the company\u2019s Raptor engines, which underwent a successful test with its Starhopper test vehicle late last month. One of the engines lifted the vehicle about 500 feet, and then it landed on a nearby landing pad.\n\nThe company is working on an aggressive timeline. It aims to reach Mars by 2022 and bring a crew there two years later. SpaceX is also tentatively scheduled to begin transporting passengers as soon as 2023, with the Japanese billionaire Yusaka Maezawa booked on a trip to the Moon then.\n\nBut outsider observers should take that schedule with a grain of salt, according to Laura Forczyk, the founder of space consulting firm Astralytica. However, she added that the fact that SpaceX has actually been testing hardware does lend credibility to their plans \u2014 even if they may not come to fruition as quickly as some have hoped.\n\n\u201cI do see it happening eventually,\u201d she said.\n\nSpaceX began working on reusable rockets at a time when others thought it would never be economically feasible. Successfully operating the Starship rockets the way SpaceX has planned would be \u201ca game-changer,\u201d according to Forczyk.\n\n\u201cThat would be something the space community has never seen before,\u201d she said.\n\nKeeping aspirational goals like that timeline has helped fuel SpaceX\u2019s success so far, Forczyk said. So has Musk\u2019s decision to fund the company himself and with government contracts.\n\nMusk\u2019s showmanship \u2014 like when SpaceX launched a Tesla Roadster toward the sun \u2014 has also helped draw top talent to the company, according to Forczyk.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 27, 2017 file photo, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk congratulates teams competing on the Hyperloop Pod Competition II at SpaceX's Hyperloop track in Hawthorne, Calif.

One team in Texas and another in Florida are each responsible for building their own Starship prototype, with the two groups racing to beat each other while also sharing information.\n\n\u201cThat seems to have worked well,\u201d Forczyk said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMusk has said the company is next aiming for a 20-kilometer Starship test flight in October and they will attempt to get into orbit after that.
