But Sharpless faced tough questions about why the agency hadn\u2019t acted sooner \u2014 or done more \u2014 to grapple with the growing e-cigarette industry.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed it\u2019s taken so long to get to this point,\u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has oversight authority over the FDA.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe expected guidance will mark a pivot from the agency\u2019s previous stance on e-cigarettes. The FDA has authority over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco under federal law. In 2016, the agency determined that e-cigarettes also fell under that umbrella and asked companies to file applications to market their products by August 2018. But in 2017, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb rolled out a new plan to curb nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes \u2014 and noted that e-cigarettes could play an important role in that plan by giving adult smokers an alternative to conventional cigarettes.\n\nSo the FDA used its \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d to delay those marketing application deadlines to 2022. The deadline has since been moved to May 2020, though companies can file applications sooner.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to sweep market of e-cigs at very moment we sought to regulate nicotine in cigarettes,\u201d Gottlieb said on Twitter Wednesday. He noted that the agency\u2019s goal was to help adults who were currently addicted to smoking cigarettes to quit the habit.\n\nThe new guidance, when finalized, will mean the agency is no longer exercising that enforcement discretion, Sharpless said. The FDA will start sending warning letters with the expectation that flavored vaping products \u2014 other than those flavored like tobacco \u2014 will be removed from the market. If they aren\u2019t pulled from shelves, the agency would follow up with more warning letters, fines, injunctions, or other actions.\n\n\u201cWe believe this policy will have a dramatic effect on the flavored products sold on the market today,\u201d Sharpless said. He did not confirm whether the final guidance would include mint and menthol vaping products, but said the \u201cdata support mint and menthol being significant problems.\u201d\n\nThe hearing came on the heels of the news that Juul, the e-cigarette giant, is suspending all of its advertising and will not lobby against the federal guidance on flavored vaping products. The company also announced on Wednesday that its chief executive officer is stepping down.\n\nJuul\u2019s marketing practices also came under scrutiny during the hearing. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) noted the FDA\u2019s warning letter to Juul earlier this month over the company\u2019s unproven safety claims, including statements made in a presentation to students during school. She also pressed the health officials on how they plan to tackle the promotion of e-cigarettes on social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the kind of tactics used with cigarettes being used again,\u201d said Anne Schuchat, the deputy principal director of the CDC, of e-cigarette marketing broadly.\n\nLawmakers also grilled Sharpless and Schuchat, the deputy principal director of the CDC who was also testifying, about the ongoing outbreak of vaping-related illnesses. The outbreak has been tied to hundreds of illnesses and nine deaths. Schuchat said she expects the number of cases to increase \u201cby hundreds\u201d when the CDC releases new data later this week.\n\nBoth health officials said their agencies feel a strong sense of urgency about addressing both the vaping-related illnesses and the widespread use of e-cigarettes among young people.\n\n\u201cWe will not rest until we have answers to the questions in the investigation, and until we have dramatically reduced the access and appeal of e-cigarettes to kids,\u201d Sharpless said.", "description": "The FDA chief faced tough questions about why his agency hadn\u2019t done more to grapple with the growing e-cigarette industry.", "authors": ["Megan Thielking", "Andrew Joseph", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Meghana Keshavan", "Damian Garde"], "top_image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nci-vol-11758-300-1024x576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
