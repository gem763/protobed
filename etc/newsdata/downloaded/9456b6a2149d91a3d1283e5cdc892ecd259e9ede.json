UPDATE 1-India's central bank cuts rates yet again in bid to revive growth\n\n(Adds details, context and background on policy, economy)\n\nBy Swati Bhat and Euan Rocha\n\nMUMBAI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India on Friday cut interest rates for a fifth straight meeting this year, stepping up its efforts to kickstart an economy growing at its slowest pace in six years.\n\nThe central bank, which also downgraded its 2019-20 growth forecast, said it will maintain its current \"accommodative\" policy stance \"as long as it is necessary\" to revive growth, and ensure inflation remains within target.\n\nThe six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the repo rate INREPO=ECI by 25 basis points to 5.15%, in line with expectations in a Reuters poll. The reverse repo rate INRREP=ECI was reduced to 4.9%.\n\nAll six MPC members voted in favour of a rate cut and for retaining the accommodative stance, the statement said.\n\nMarkets were little changed as the RBI decision was largely in-line with expectations.\n\nThe broader NSE Index , which was up 0.60% before the policy decision, pared those gains after the rate cut and were last up 0.06%. The 10-year benchmark bond yield IN072629G=CC rose to 6.64% from 6.59% before the announcement, while the rupee INR=D4 was largely flat at 70.83 per dollar.\n\nECONOMIC SLOWDOWN\n\n\"While the recent measures announced by the government are likely to help strengthen private consumption and spur private investment activity, the continuing slowdown warrants intensified efforts to restore the growth momentum,\" the MPC, said in its statement.\n\nTo revive the faltering economy, the government in September announced a steep cut in the corporate tax rate - to 22% from 30% - triggering the biggest intraday gain in Indian stocks in more than a decade.\n\nAsia's third-largest economy expanded by just 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace since 2013, on the back of low consumer demand and a slowdown in government spending amid global trade frictions.\n\nThe weak GDP numbers prompted several economists to lower their growth projections.\n\nThe RBI also cut its real GDP growth forecast for 2019-20 to 6.1% from a prior projection of 6.9%.\n\nThe RBI has now cumulatively lowered interest rates by 135 bps this year, but the central bank said that \"transmission has remained staggered and incomplete.\"\n\nIt noted that the weighted average lending rate on fresh loans has fallen by just 29 bps, versus the 110 bps cut, ahead of today's announcement.", "description": "UPDATE 1-India's central bank cuts rates yet again in bid to revive growth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5N005_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
