(Justin Chin/Bloomberg)\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party appears to have \u201csuperuser\u201d access to all the data on more than 100 million cellphones, owing to a back door in a propaganda app that the government has been promoting aggressively this year.\n\nAn examination of the code in the app shows it enables authorities to retrieve every message and photo from a user\u2019s phone, browse their contacts and Internet history, and activate an audio recorder inside the device, according to a U.S.-funded analysis.\n\n\u201cThe [Chinese Communist Party] essentially has access to over 100 million users\u2019 data,\u201d said Sarah Aoun, director of technology at the Open Technology Fund, an initiative funded by the U.S. government under Radio Free Asia. \u201cThat\u2019s coming from the top of a government that is expanding its surveillance into citizens\u2019 day-to-day lives.\u201d\n\nThe party, led by Xi Jinping, launched the app, called \u201cStudy the Great Nation,\u201d in January. The name is a pun because the Chinese word for study \u2014 \u201cxuexi\u201d \u2014 contains the authoritarian leader\u2019s family name.\n\n[Apple pulls police-tracking app used by Hong Kong protesters]\n\nThe app contains news articles and videos, many of them about Xi\u2019s activities or his ideology, \u201cXi Jinping Thought.\u201d There is even a sense of competition, with users earning points for reading articles and commenting on them, and a leader board showing how users are faring in quizzes.\n\nThe app, which can be downloaded on all types of smartphones including Apple and Android, has been called Xi\u2019s high-tech equivalent of Mao Zedong\u2019s Little Red Book and was launched amid a campaign to bolster the Communist Party\u2019s ideological control over the Chinese population.\n\nIt quickly became the most downloaded app in China, including in Apple\u2019s app store in the country, with state media reporting in April that it had more than 100 million registered users. Google is blocked in China, so Android users must download the app through other means.\n\nThere have been suspicions about the app\u2019s invasiveness \u2014 although many people in China are conscious that the authorities can read their messages if they want to. A cybersecurity law enacted two years ago required all tech companies to share user data with the government.\n\nDigital forensics\n\nThe Open Tech Fund contracted Cure53, a German cybersecurity firm, to break apart the app and determine its exact capabilities. Although they were not able to fully assess the app\u2019s functionalities because of code designed to thwart attempts to dissect the app, the Cure53 auditors found code that amounts to a back door into the phone that is able to run arbitrary commands with \u201csuperuser\u201d privileges.\n\n\n\nAn image of Chinese President Xi Jinping planting a tree is displayed on the \u201cStudy the Great Nation\u201d app. (Justin Chin/Bloomberg)\n\nGranting such privileges is tantamount to giving administrator-level access to a user\u2019s phone, and this kind of code is generally considered to be malicious. Superuser privileges give developers the power to download any software, modify files and data, or install a program to log key strokes.\n\n[Read the Cure53 report on the Chinese app]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very uncommon for an application to require that level of access to the device, and there\u2019s no reason to have these privileges unless you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re not supposed to be,\u201d said Adam Lynn, the Open Tech Fund\u2019s research director.\n\n\u201cThe access itself is significant. The fact that they\u2019ve gone to these lengths [to hide it] only further heightens the scrutiny around this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe investigation could not reveal how the code or the information it gathered was being used, but there was no legitimate reason a supposedly educational app would seek to run commands on users\u2019 phones with high privilege levels, the fund wrote in a commentary about the Cure53 report, which will be published Monday.\n\n[\u2018Boiling us like frogs\u2019: China\u2019s clampdown on Muslims creeps into the heartland, finds new targets ]\n\nA review of the terms and conditions of the app, which was developed by the Communist Party\u2019s Propaganda Department in collaboration with the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, show that users must agree to allow access to a vast trove of information and functions.\n\nThis includes allowing the app to access and take photos and videos, transmit the user\u2019s location, activate audio recording, dial phone numbers and trawl through the user\u2019s contacts and Internet activity, as well as retrieve information from 960 other applications including shopping, travel and messaging platforms. It even requires the ability to connect to WiFi and turn on the flashlight.\n\n\u201cIt can take over the entire device, and it could be sending back information,\u201d said Lynn.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe app collects and sends detailed log reports on a daily basis, containing a wealth of user data and app activity, the investigation found.\n\nThe State Council Information Office, responding on behalf of the Propaganda Department, denied the app contained such functions.\n\n\u201cWe learned from those who run the \u2018Study the Great Nation\u2019 app that there is no such thing as you have mentioned,\u201d the office said in a response to faxed questions outlining the report\u2019s main findings.\n\nAlibaba declined to comment, referring questions to the Propaganda Department. It has previously said that the app was built using software from its messaging app, DingTalk.\n\n[Paramount and paranoid: China\u2019s Xi faces a crisis of confidence ]\n\nA spokesman for DingTalk tried to distance the subsidiary from the app.\n\n\u201cDingTalk is an open technology platform, and its suite of technology tools can be used for independent development of other applications and does not have any \u2018backdoor code\u2019 or scanning issues,\u201d the spokesman said in a message forwarded by Alibaba.\n\nBut Alibaba\u2019s fingerprints were all over the app. The packages that contain the \u201cbackdoor\u201d code have the values \u201caliyun and Alabama,\u201d suggesting these packages were created and are maintained by Alibaba or Alibaba Cloud, the Open Tech Fund said.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, has an array of U.S. investments, including Lyft.\n\nTo use the app, users must sign up with their real names and cellphone numbers, creating a trail since all phones in China must be registered to a national ID card number.\n\n\n\nVisitors take photos with their smartphones of an installation depicting a heart-shaped Chinese national flag in Shanghai, on Sept. 27, 2019, before the People\u2019s Republic of China marked its 70th anniversary on Oct. 1.

The Communist Party has issued directives to its members to download the app, as have many workplaces.\n\nOrganizations from the Beijing Chaoyang Lawyers\u2019 Association and Peking University to the Hunan Vocational College of Science & Technology and a bus company in Jinan province have ordered their members to use the app.\n\n[Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is facing the wrath of her people. Beijing may be even angrier. ]\n\nStarting this month, about 10,000 reporters and editors in Beijing will take part in a pilot test that is expected to extend nationwide, in which they will be tested on their knowledge of Xi Jinping Thought through the app.\n\nThe Propaganda Department\u2019s media oversight office made it clear that only those who passed would get new press cards, which are required to work as a journalist in China.\n\nLast month, 60 proficient app users were chosen to come to Beijing and watch a special artistic performance in the Great Hall of People on Tiananmen Square.\n\nMa Weizhong, the deputy director of Chizhou Environment Bureau in Anhui province, said he felt \u201cblood surging in my heart\u201d when he learned he would be going. \u201cI felt both proud and honored, and a great sense of responsibility,\u201d Ma, who started using the app in January, told local media.\n\n\n\nA large portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping passes by a screen showing video of him speaking during a parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China in Beijing on Oct. 1, 2019. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\n\nOthers are not so happy about their workplace-mandated usage sessions, which have become so stringent that some entrepreneurial types have started services where they will log app hours on a customer\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cSometimes even when I'm very tired and have put my baby to sleep, I still have to complete my \u2018Study the Great Nation,\u2019 otherwise my pay will be cut,\u201d one disgruntled app user wrote on Weibo, the Chinese answer to Twitter. Another complained about having to write a 2,000-word self-criticism because they didn\u2019t earn enough points on the app.\n\nThe Open Tech Fund concluded that the app contained code that should be alarming to users and app store owners alike.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that while the CCP advertises \u2018Study the Great Nation\u2019 as a way for citizens to prove their loyalty and study their country, the app\u2019s maintainers are studying them right back,\u201d it wrote in its commentary.\n\nWang Yuan, Liu Yang and Lyric Li in Beijing and Greg Bensinger in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nBanned at home, Twitter becomes new tool for Chinese diplomats abroad\n\nChina cancels broadcasts of NBA preseason games in dispute over Hong Kong comments\n\nChina rolls out its military firepower with emphasis on \u2018Cold War-style\u2019 nuclear might\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The propaganda app \u2014 mandatory in some workplaces \u2014 can give the Communist Party a powerful new surveillance tool.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief.", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B7-_Ie8K0SKdFEDCi8Z28RTHj7w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QQP7P7HLSUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
