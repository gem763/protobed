But the formula isn\u2019t so straightforward for rap. Subject matter counts; so does songwriting; so does novelty; so does audience engagement. In place of the Mariah Carey melisma that many young vocalists try to use to prove their chops, a lot of the newbie emcees attempt the high-speed, rat-a-tat delivery of rappers such as Twista and Eminem. The judges often shoot these types down. \u201cYou definitely can rap, but I\u2019m trying to see you on the outside,\u201d Cardi B tells one. \u201cBecause these kids nowaday, they really like simple stuff.\u201d\n\nA new superstar herself, Cardi is the show\u2019s most reliable entertainment. Her flamboyant outfits and voices\u2014she\u2019s lately loved affecting a Mafia-don mumble\u2014liven up the first two episodes. But she\u2019s also Rhythm + Flow\u2019s voice of reason, verging on cynicism as she tells contestant after contestant to focus on marketability. This doesn\u2019t mean sticking to her style of mass appeal: \u201cYou\u2019re very different from me\u2014I\u2019m selling boobs, I\u2019m selling ass and everything, but if I was to hear your song, I wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d she says to a more bookish type. \u201cI like it.\u201d But it does mean personality and hooks are more important than #bars, respectability be damned.\u201cYou can write for me if you want to,\u201d she compliments one rapper, deliciously ignoring fuddy-duddy stigmas against ghostwriting.\n\nThe other judges also come off as constructed characters who embody specific reads on what\u2019s good and bad hip-hop. T.I. is the statesman, swaddled in crisp suits and sweaters while cobbling SAT words into slogans about authenticity (e.g., \u201cWhat the barbershop deems acceptable and appropriate is very important\u201d). Chance is the low-key craftsman who seems embarrassed by his own participation in the show, and his episode in Chicago is suffused with his slam-poetry-adjacent, socially conscious approach. When a guy in mascara growls through a performance that represents the series\u2019s one flirtation with the current emo/goth boom, Chance seems legitimately horrified. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of demonic shit in that rap, yo,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the weeks to come, new stars will emerge as the contestant class is culled via rap battles, music-video shoots, and recording sessions. But the first batch simply shows a diverse array of unknowns trying to blow minds onstage. Hip-hop prizes a close and convincing tie between identity and performance, and the judges are frank\u2014maybe too frank\u2014about the industry\u2019s biases. T.I. says he doesn\u2019t want to promote someone who\u2019s just \u201cdope for a girl.\u201d Cardi B counsels a gay rapper that he\u2019ll have to work extra hard. While the series seems strangely uninterested in the internet\u2014the music cues and editing often seem to set up a network commercial break that never comes\u2014Twitter will inevitably judge the judging. Are there more comments about the women\u2019s appearances? Who gets points for vulnerability, and who gets dinged for it?", "description": "Cardi B anchors Netflix\u2019s fascinating rap competition, Rhythm + Flow.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RAF_1_SAMPLE_Unit_00495/facebook.jpg?1570651247", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
