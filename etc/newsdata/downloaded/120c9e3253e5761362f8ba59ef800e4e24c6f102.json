Crucially, the dispatch was published the day after then\u2013House Speaker Paul Ryan easily fended off avowed white nationalist and anti-Semite Paul Nehlen in a closely watched but ultimately uncompetitive Republican primary.\n\nIn the voice of his persona, Olson wrote that Ryan had \u201csuffered a massive, historic, emasculating 70-point victory.\u201d\n\nResponding to a commenter who wrote that Ryan was a \u201cneo-con, too\u201d \u2014 a frequent epithet aimed at Establishment Republicans \u2014 Olson wrote, \u201cNo he\u2019s not. Neo-cons are all Upper East Size Zionists who don\u2019t golf on Saturday if you know what I mean.\u201d The commenter responded \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant. He\u2019s a Jew. Everyone knows that.\u201d Olson wrote back, \u201cIt must be true because I\u2019ve never seen the Lamestream Media report it, and you know they protect their own.\u201d\n\nThough admittedly difficult to parse at first glance, Olson\u2019s remarks were quite clearly meant to mock Nehlen\u2019s prejudiced and conspiratorial views.\n\nOlson underlined his point in a follow-up post, in which he explained that he had been mocking the preemptive triumphalism of a populist movement that had not come close to dethroning its Establishment adversary, and criticizing news outlets \u2014 Breitbart specifically \u2014 for carrying its water.\n\nBut the Bloomberg Law story did not delve into the particulars of the Ryan election, or how it figured into Olson\u2019s comments.\n\nOlson told the outlet that his Facebook posts amounted to \u201csarcastic criticism of the alt-right\u2019s conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic positions.\u201d But when the outlet asked the Department of Labor for comment about his social-media activity, the agency said that it had \u201caccepted the resignation of Leif Olson effective immediately.\u201d The exact circumstances of his departure are unclear.\n\nNews of Olson\u2019s departure drew a swift backlash from writers and commentators on the left and right throughout the day on Tuesday.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cscoop,\u201d Ben. It\u2019s a deliberate attempt to get a guy fired for mocking the very position you\u2019re accusing him of holding. And you know it. \u2014 Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) September 3, 2019\n\nI know little about Leif Olson and probably strongly disagree with his policy goals, but it seems highly dubious to report his sarcasm as actual antisemitism\u2014again, the context makes it overwhelmingly clear that he was ridiculing antisemites. \u2014 Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) September 3, 2019\n\nThe more I think about this ridiculous hit on Leif Olson, the more I'm disturbed by the quick resignation. If that obviously sarcastic post is all there was, then ride it out. Defend your people. \u2014 David French (@DavidAFrench) September 3, 2019\n\nThe conservative Washington Examiner called the story \u201cone of the most shameful, egregious media failures of the year,\u201d while the liberal Vox labeled the accusations against Olson \u201cunfair and misleading.\u201d\n\nPenn did not offer a clear defense of his story, other than to point out that the Facebook posts in question were public. He also posted private Twitter messages in which conservative commentator John Podhoretz attacked him for his reporting in personal terms.\n\nTo Leif Olson's friends & others who take issue with this reporting,\n\nI sent a screenshot of a public FB post to DOL, seeking comment. 4 hours later I received this response: \u201cToday, the Department of Labor accepted the resignation of Leif Olson effective immediately.\u201d https://t.co/PZbIScDHqe \u2014 Ben Penn (@benjaminpenn) September 3, 2019\n\nMy fellow journalist \u2066@jpodhoretz\u2069 is DMing me that I\u2019m a \u201cmiserable prick\u201d and a \u201crepugnant child.\u201d All over this piece: https://t.co/68kDvaFn0h pic.twitter.com/VJGLaD9vTZ \u2014 Ben Penn (@benjaminpenn) September 3, 2019\n\nResponding to a request for comment, Bloomberg\u2019s director of corporate communications told Intelligencer: \u201cWe stand behind our reporting. We contacted the White House and the Department of Labor asking for comment on Mr. Olson\u2019s Facebook posts. Within four hours, the Department of Labor responded that Mr. Olson had resigned.\u201d\n\nBut there were signs that the story was not withstanding scrutiny. The Anti-Defamation League, which initially condemned Olson\u2019s Facebook posts, changed its tack on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Bloomberg Law story on Leif Olson appears to be crumbling around it. Jake Hyman of the ADL is quoted in the story calling Olson's FB post \"clearly anti-Semitic.\" An ADL spox sends this statement: pic.twitter.com/03o5oFgCRp \u2014 ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) September 3, 2019\n\nLeif Olson did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, Olson wrote: \u201cGreetings, Bloomberg readers. I never thought I\u2019d see the day when making fun of alt-right anti-Semites led to being branded an anti-Semite, but here we are.\u201d In the post, he also took issue with the Bloomberg story\u2019s portrayal of his role in various legal cases, including one involving same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Trump administration has hired no shortage of people with a history of making bigoted remarks \u2014 some of whom have withdrawn or been removed when those indiscretions came to light. But Olson\u2019s case brings to mind Shirley Sherrod, a President Obama appointee who was fired in 2010 as Georgia State Director of Rural Development after Breitbart touted a misleadingly edited clip that showed her appearing to make racist remarks. Her firing led to an apology from Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, as well as an offer of a new position \u2014 which Sherrod declined.\n\nWith the indignation over his removal unlikely to subside, Olson may live to get a second chance as well.", "description": "After a misleading Bloomberg story led to his ouster, commentators from both sides of the political spectrum agree that Leif Olson got a raw deal.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/03/03-white-house.w1200.h630.jpg"}
