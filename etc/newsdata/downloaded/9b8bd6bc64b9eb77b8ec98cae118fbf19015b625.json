Most of the time they are young attractive women who seduce Obelix and their role stops there.\u201d\n\nAsterix and Obelix must protect Adrenalin from the Romans, who are hunting her, but the two battle-hardened warriors cannot control the grumpy teenager with braided red hair and gold headphones.", "description": "Asterix, the short but plucky Gaul forever outwitting the Romans, yesterday/THURS made way for the first female hero in the popular comic book\u2019s 60-year history.", "authors": ["David Chazan", "Laura Freeman", "Michael Deacon", "Asa Bennett", "Tom Harris", "Charlotte Gill", "Pieter Cleppe"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000214005676-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
