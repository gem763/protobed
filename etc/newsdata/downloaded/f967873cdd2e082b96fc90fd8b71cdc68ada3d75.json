Many of them do not earn a living wage.\n\nFairChain\u2019s project aspires to ensure that farmers are better paid for their cocoa, with a target of achieving a price of \u20ac3,080 per metric ton for their cocoa. FairTrade reportedly pays farmers \u20ac3,080 per metric ton, while commercial buyers pay roughly \u20ac1,721.\n\nFairChain Foundation founder Guido van Staveren has said that:\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to use technology to influence consumer behavior and basically turn every product into a capitalist impact engine.\u201d\n\nDonation transparency\n\nEach of the tokens in The Other Bar project is reportedly worth around one-quarter of the value of a cocoa tree. The funding raised will be used to plant new trees, with consumers able to track the impact of their donations using data recorded on the blockchain.\n\nAs reported, the UN has long been exploring multiple \u2014 largely humanitarian \u2014 use cases for blockchain technology, beginning with its use of the Ethereum blockchain to transfer coupons based on cryptocurrencies to refugees in Syria, followed by a blockchain-based digital identity system designed to combat child trafficking globally.\n\nThis July, the UN unveiled its research into blockchain solutions to foster sustainable urban development in Afghanistan.\n\nThe chief of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Global Cybercrime Program has nonetheless recently warned that decentralized cryptocurrencies have made combating money laundering, cybercrime and terrorism financing significantly harder.", "description": "The United Nations Development Programme has partnered with Dutch NGO the FairChain Foundation to use blockchain for the more equitable funding of cocoa farmers", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNDdlYmNhZjU0ZTg5MTAzNzgyOGM5MDYyMjZiNjJmYzUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
