However, hand guns, rifles and tasers are kept in their vehicles and can be used with a supervisor's permission.\n\nSerious crime is relatively unusual in New Zealand, although frontline police were armed for several weeks following the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15 by a suspected white supremacist.\n\nThe attack sparked a debate on whether all police should carry fire arms.\n\n\"Following the events of March 15 in Christchurch, our operating environment has changed,\" Police Commissioner Mike Bush said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"Police must ensure our people are equipped and enabled to perform their roles safely and to ensure our communities are, and feel, safe. This means having the right people with the right tools, skills and knowledge ready to respond at all times,\" he said.\n\nThe Armed Response Teams will be deployed in Manukau county in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and Waikato and Canterbury on October 28 on a six-month trial.\n\nThey will be routinely armed, equipped, mobile and ready to support frontline police officers at incidents that require enhanced tactical capabilities, Bush said.\n\nHe said there was no immediate threat.\n\nPeople lay flowers at a makeshift memorial for the victims of the Christchurch mosque attack, the worst atrocity to hit the island in peacetime. [EPA]\n\n1.5 million guns\n\nAustralian national Brenton Tarrant has been charged over the Christchurch attack, New Zealand's worst peace-time shooting. Tarrant has pleaded not guilty to 92 charges against him and faces trial in May.\n\nThreat levels have been heightened around the country since the massacre and 1,400 firearms have been seized from offenders since March.\n\nPolice Minister Stuart Nash said the move did not mean that police would be armed routinely.\n\n\"The three areas have been selected for the trial because of the incidence of crimes involving armed offenders,\" Nash said.\n\n\"Police turn up to some callouts with no knowledge of what they are walking into. Every month police turn up to 200 incidents where a firearm is involved,\" he said.\n\nNash was also quoted by the NZ Herald as saying previously that he does not support the general arming of police.\n\nNew Zealanders must have a gun licence to own a firearm. There are an estimated 1.5 million guns in the country.\n\nThe government banned military-style semi-automatic and other high-calibre guns within weeks of the Christchurch shooting and also introduced a gun amnesty scheme.\n\nMore than 29,000 firearms have been collected so far, according to statistics provided on the police website.", "description": "Armed units to patrol in three areas starting on October 28 on six-month trial in response to mosque attacks in March.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/5ef7a4d7e3fd48ef9074cf1ea96e878e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
