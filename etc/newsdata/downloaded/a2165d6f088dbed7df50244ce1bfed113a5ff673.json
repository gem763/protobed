Fulfilling one of his ambitious promises, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced that women in Delhi will be able to travel on DTC and feeder buses for free, starting from Tuesday.\n\nIn August this year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, Kejriwal had announced the scheme as \"a gift to our sisters, which will ensure their safety.\"\n\nBCCL/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nAfter getting the approval of the transport minister, the notification was issued on Monday, and the free rides will come into effect from Tuesday, the day of Bhai Dooj.\n\nCongratulations Delhi !!!\n\nThis is a historic step for women safety and empowerment https://t.co/wjLf4jB0GZ \u2014 Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) October 28, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 2.7 K SHARES 491 SHARES 13.2 K SHARES 18.2 K SHARES 11.4 K SHARES\n\nUnder the scheme, all women travellers will be issued a pink ticket with a face value of Rs 10 by the conductors, however, they won't have to pay the amount. The government will reimburse DTC based on the number of such tickets issued.\n\nBCCL/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nAccording to the government, as many as 1.5 crore pink passes have already been printed and around 10 lakh passes will be issued daily.\n\nThere are around 3,700 DTC buses and 1,800 buses under the cluster scheme of the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS).\n\nThe free bus rides are likely to benefit millions of women, especially those working in the unorganized sector and low-income jobs who could not afford public transport.\n\nAccording to the government, the free rides will help in improving the dubious women safety record of the national capital.\n\nBCCL/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nAdditionally, the government has also increased the number of marshals in public buses, to nearly 13,000, to ensure the safety of women on board. At present, there are around 3,400 bus marshals in Delhi.\n\nEarlier, in June the Kejriwal government had proposed to make metro rides free for women. However, this did not materialise due to the opposition from the Central government who is also an equal stakeholder in DMRC.\n\nOne more time, we would like to as the government, will this ensure women's safety too?", "description": "Fulfilling one of his ambitious promises, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced that women in the national capital will be able to travel on DTC and feeder buses for free, starting from Tuesday.
