The House of Lords must approve.\n\nBoris Johnson 0-1 in the UK parliament losing a Benn Bill Brexit Showdown with Parliament.\n\nThis was a vote to allow a vote. The actual vote is tomorrow.\n\nIn response, Boris Johnson he will not accept the bill which would force him to seek a Brexit extension until January 31, 2019.\n\nInstead, Johnson tabled a motion for general election.\n\nJeremy Corbyn says that if Johnson wants an election, he must get the bill passed first.\n\nJo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader backs the idea of an election, but not before MPs have removed the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\nJohnson's Statement\n\nLet there be no doubt about the consequences of this vote tonight. It means that parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal we might be able to strike in Brussels. Because tomorrow\u2019s bill would hand control of the negotiations to the EU. And that would mean more dither, more delay, more confusion. And it would mean that the EU themselves would be able decide how long to keep this country in the EU. And since I refuse to go along with that plan we are going to have to make a choice. I don\u2019t want an election. The public don\u2019t want an election. But if the House votes for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on October 17 to sort this out and take this country forward. Everyone will know if the Rt Hon Gentleman [Jeremy Corbyn] is the prime minister, he will go to Brussels, he will beg for an extension, you will accept whatever Brussels demands and we\u2019ll have years more arguments over Brexit. And by contrast, everyone will know that if I am prime minister, I will go to Brussels, I will go for a deal and get a deal but if they won\u2019t do a deal we will leave anyway on 31 October. The people of this country will have to choose. The leader of the Opposition has been begging for an election for two years. I don\u2019t want an election but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop the negotiations and to compel another pointless delay of Brexit, potentially for years, then that will be the only way to resolve this. I can confirm that tonight we will are tabling a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nIf the bill passes, it goes to the House of Lords where it will be debated.\n\nFirst, Johnson will attempt a filibuster. However, there may be enough votes to take away that option. Also if the bill is amended in any form, it will go back to Commons for approval.\n\nAssuming those options fail, Johnson may seek the extension but only on condition Parliament agrees to his request for elections.\n\nAnother possibility is to simply not honor the request. If Johnson delays until September 10, Parliament will not be in session again until October 14.\n\nMeanwhile any Tory who votes against the government tomorrow will be outed from the party.\n\n21 Tories Rebel\n\nNo Second Chance - Update\n\nAndrea Leadsom said the rebels would be given a second chance tomorrow.\n\nThe Guardian just posted this update.\n\nMark Spencer, the chief whip, has been ringing the Tory rebels telling them they are having the whip withdrawn, we\u2019ve been told. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, has already had the call. As of now, he is technically no longer a Conservative MP.\n\nAll 21 Rebel MPs were just kicked out of the Tory party.\n\nMost of those rebels will lose their seats in the next election.\n\nPrice to Pay\n\nExpect a Landslide\n\nWhen the elections do take place, it is highly likely Johnson teams up with Nigel Farage.\n\nIf so, I suggest he will win in a landslide given the first-past-the-post rules (the person with the most vote wins).\n\nThe Remainers are horribly split. Labour may even fall to third place.\n\nBlame the Ramainers\n\nIf Johnson wins a majority, No Deal will happen as the Remainer Tories will lose their seats.\n\nFinally, prepare to blame the Remainers for not allowing Johnson to attempt to work out a deal with the EU.\n\nAddendum", "description": "Boris Johnson lost an \"emergency\" So24 bill designed to prevent .10/02/2019 12:48:42PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/204/7eb51554-f6cf-4f84-8272-439cfd6df9db.png"}
