That figure increased to 24.4 percent this year with the latest data, according to the statistics agency.The government downplayed the results on Tuesday, explaining that this year\u2019s rise was caused by an inclusion of a new category of temporary workers due to changes in calculation standards by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Statistics Korea estimated that as many as 500,000 workers were added due to the change, arguing that this year\u2019s figures should not be compared with those from the past.\u201cEven accounting for such excuses, there was a significant increase,\u201d said Kim Tai-gi, a professor of economics at Dankook University. \u201cThis can be explained as a failure in labor policy.\u201dKim added that stronger labor regulations under the current administration likely discouraged businesses from actively hiring employees for the regular payroll.A recent government drive to increase jobs for older workers also contributed to the increase in temporary workers.\u201cConsidering the recent changes in employment trends, there has been an increase in the share of over-60-year-old workers,\u201d said Kang Shin-wook, commissioner of Statistics Korea during a briefing at the Central Government Complex in Seoul. \u201cThere is a high possibility that these workers have a fixed employment period.\u201dThe government plans to create 610,000 jobs for the elderly this year to deal with an aging population.According to agency data, people over 59 years old held 25.9 percent of all temporary jobs, up 1 percentage point from last year. The share for that age group stood at 22.5 percent in 2016.The average period of employment for temporary workers dropped by 2 months to 2 years and 5 months this year. Wages for regular and temporary workers both rose by 5.2 percent.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/29204203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
