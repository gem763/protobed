He will do a great job!\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\nAides said Trump had gotten to know O\u2019Brien through his work as the U.S. envoy for hostage negotiations and admired his ability to get hostages returned from North Korea and Turkey.\n\nThe job most recently took him to Sweden in a bid to get the American rapper known professionally as A$AP Rocky out of jail on an assault charge.\n\nTrump appeared before reporters with O\u2019Brien at his side on the tarmac alongside Air Force One in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI think we have a very good chemistry together and I think we\u2019re going to have a great relationship. He is a very talented man,\u201d Trump said.\n\nA source close to the White House said Trump wanted to pick a new adviser who would be able to get along well with Pompeo after the secretary of state sometimes struggled with Bolton.\n\nO\u2019Brien, the source said, \u201cis a low-profile, articulate negotiator who has a strong relationship with Pompeo.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien follows in the footsteps of three other national security advisers: Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster and, most recently, Bolton, who clashed with the president over a host of issues from Iran to Afghanistan to North Korea.\n\nBolton parted ways with Trump a little more than a week ago, his stormy ending coming shortly after he disagreed with the prospect of the president easing some sanctions on Iran, a person close to Bolton said.\n\nWithin the National Security Council, O\u2019Brien\u2019s critical task will be to stabilize a sprawling foreign policy apparatus where morale has taken a major hit since Trump took office, according to an NSC insider.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt firing of Bolton added to a sense of unease among NSC staff. A key question is whether O\u2019Brien will reinstate the inter-agency coordinating role for which the NSC was originally conceived but which was largely put on ice during Bolton\u2019s tenure, the source said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump faces reporters with U.S. hostage negotiator Robert O'Brien after he named O'Brien as his fourth White House national security adviser at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nFor Trump, O\u2019Brien represents a toned-down choice for the job, a sign that the president was happy to have someone without the television starpower of Bolton.\n\nO\u2019Brien is an attorney from Los Angeles who served as a foreign policy adviser to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and 2016 candidate Scott Walker. He has handled a number of high-profile legal cases and previously served in several State Department positions, including as an alternative representative to the U.N. General Assembly in 2005.\n\nO\u2019Brien has been a fan of the recently departed Bolton since the two worked together when Bolton was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005 during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn a December 2016 column for radio host Hugh Hewitt\u2019s website, O\u2019Brien called Bolton \u201ca formidable diplomat and a patriot\u201d in recommending the newly elected Trump pick Bolton for a high-profile assignment.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s job as our man at the UN was never easy, often exhausting and painfully slow at points. But John, the definition of a diplomat, never grew physically tired or ever lost his temper with other diplomats or the mission\u2019s staff,\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote.\n\nTrump in March had complimented O\u2019Brien for doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d after gaining the release of American hostage Danny Burch in Yemen.\n\nPeople close to the White House said Trump was looking for someone who would manage the national security process, voice opinions behind the scenes but not go public with differences.\n\nOne of the most prominent hostage cases O\u2019Brien has worked on is that of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist believed by the U.S. government to be alive who was abducted in Syria in August 2012 while reporting on the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nTice\u2019s parents, Marc and Debra Tice, praised what they described as O\u2019Brien\u2019s quiet, dogged efforts to win their son\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kept us informed and been regularly in touch,\u201d Marc Tice told Reuters in a telephone interview from his Houston home. \u201cWith Robert in this new role, Austin\u2019s return can happen even sooner.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump picked U.S. hostage negotiator Robert O'Brien on Wednesday as his fourth White House national security adviser, turning to a low-key choice for the position after the boisterous tenure of John Bolton.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431315675&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1N1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
