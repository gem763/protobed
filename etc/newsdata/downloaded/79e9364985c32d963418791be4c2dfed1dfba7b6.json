A recent episode of the 22-year-old show features a story line more or less designed to get pushback from the government, and creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s \u201capology\u201d doubles down, making fun of companies that are quick to appease Chinese censors in order to make money. The episode, in which the boys form a metal band and have to contort their biopic to be acceptable to Chinese standards, has been wiped from streaming platform Youku while all discussion of the show itself has been erased from social-media sites like Weibo and Baida Tieba, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Also in the episode: Randy Marsh attempts to expand his weed business to China but immediately gets caught and sent to a work camp, where he meets Winnie the Pooh, a cuddly but deadly reference to Chinese president Xi Jinping that got Last Week Tonight censored last year.\n\nParker and Stone, presumably while clinking glasses and approving bonuses to their writers, released a backhanded apology via South Park\u2019s Twitter, accomplishing three things: calling out the NBA\u2019s reaction to Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s expressing support for the Hong Kong protests, making more fun of President Xi, and plugging the next episode (Wednesday at 10 on Comedy Central; gotta recoup that money somehow). \u201cLong live the Great Communist Party of China!\u201d concludes Stone and Parker\u2019s joint statement. \u201cMay this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful!
