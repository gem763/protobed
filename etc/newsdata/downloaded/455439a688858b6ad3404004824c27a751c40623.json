We need to look at the reasons why people are moving as well as at exploitation by smugglers or traffickers. We need to look at both at the same time.\u2019\n\nPeople hold a candlelight vigil for the victims that died in the lorry container (Picture: EPA)\n\nJarvis advocated mechanisms which would allow migrants to make the journey to the UK safer, such as humanitarian visas.\n\nThe human rights campaigner was instrumental in drawing up the landmark Mytilini Declaration document, which established rights and duties towards families of migrants who have gone missing or died.\n\n\u2018We are working to create a more respectful legal framework for the rights of dead migrants\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018We need to look at things through the eyes of the bereaved.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
