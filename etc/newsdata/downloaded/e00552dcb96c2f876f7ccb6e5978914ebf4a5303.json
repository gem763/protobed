For this, I did some research and what I found was shocking and decided that I have to work on this. That is how the idea of this photo series came up,\" Gera told Indiatimes.\n\nNiraj Gera\n\nThe photo series 'Sacred Stains\u2019 which got released earlier this year has been received with great response. He, however, admitted that it was not an easy exercise.\n\nNiraj Gera\n\n\"People including women don't want to talk about it. That was the first challenge that I faced. When I told them about the topic most of the girls were reluctant to come in front of the camera. But eventually, things began changing. I asked girls if you don't talk about periods, who will? That is how I convinced them to be a part of this project,\" Gera said.\n\nNiraj Gera\n\nHe also said that it was particularly challenging for him to address the issue as a male.\n\n\"It took it as a challenge. The question in front of me was 'why not me'? Why not each and every person around? I wanted to break this stereotype and wanted to speak about menstruation as a man. Given the fact that India is a patriarchal society, it will take the men to break this stereotype and stigma around menstruation,\" he said.\n\nGera traveled across the country and beyond for over six months and spoke to women and girls about the problems they face and the harrowing experiences that they have gone through during menstruation and gathered ideas for his photo series from real-life experiences.\n\nNiraj Gera\n\nThe predominantly monochrome photo series he said depicted all aspects of menstruation, including those celebrating them.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are more dark realities around menstruation. That is why there are more dark images in the photo series. But that is not all, there are photos which also show the positive aspects of mensuration, including the one from South India, where the first period of a girl is still celebrated,\" he said.\n\nNiraj Gera\n\nBased on his experience during the photoshoot and subsequent interactions, Gera through his NGO is now trying to spread awareness and help women and girls during their periods.\n\nHe is now running a petition on Change.org requesting the government to provide free sanitary pads/tampons to women living below the poverty line.\n\nHe also said that there should be a policy change in the country to deal with the issues around mental hygiene and suggested that the age limit of beneficiaries should be increased from 19 years to 45-50 years and free hygienic biodegradable sanitary pads should be made accessible to everyone through the ration distribution scheme for menstruating women living below the poverty line. He also suggested that there should be strict policies and laws to deal with the cases of period shaming in schools, colleges, offices, factories, and other places.", "description": "It is a sad reality that even in 2019 a conversation about menstruation is still considered taboo by a large section of our society.
