Read more\n\nBarden\u2019s seven-year-old son, Daniel, was one of the casualties of the Sandy Hook school shooting in December of 2012. Barden says that the prevention work done through SHP\u2019s trainings and advocacy is a way \u201chonor Daniel\u2019s life in a meaningful way\u201d.\n\nThe video is a part of the group\u2019s \u201cKnow the Signs\u201d campaign, which is aimed at preventing school shootings and suicides by identifying students who are at risk of hurting themselves or someone else. Through the program, SHP staff educate schools and local communities on the warning signs before a suicide or act of violence occurs.\n\nIt also comes amid political pressure on the US Senate to vote on a bill which would require background checks for all gun sales, and another bill which would strengthen background check procedures on gun retailers. Both of these passed in the House over six months ago, and House speaker Nancy Pelosi has called on Senator Mitch McConnell to \u201cgive us a vote\u201d.\n\nIn a September 15 joint press release, Pelosi and the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said that during a phone call with Donald Trump they \u201cmade it clear ... that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done.\u201d\n\nTrump is expected to announce his stance on the bills but it\u2019s not clear when a statement will be released.\n\nGun control has been one of the central topics among Democratic presidential candidates. All of the candidates support some sort of common sense gun regulations including background checks and assault weapons ban. And during the most recent debate, candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who represents Texas, emphatically supported the mandatory buyback of assault weapons, saying: \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Center for Homeland Defense and Security there have been 387 school shooting incidents since 2012, the year of Sandy Hook, , and nearly 20 in the past year alone. In 2018, the year of the Parkland shooting, there were 97 incidents, making it the worst year on record, according to the CHDS, which defines incidents as any time \u201ca gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week\u201d.\n\nAnd while Barden insists that the video is not a direct call for political action, but hopes that it will inspire voters to hold their elected officials accountable for passing regulations that can prevent gun deaths.\n\n\u201cBringing more awareness hopefully also drives public awareness to the point where [people] use their vote and their advocacy to make sure that our elected officials are on the right side of this issue as well.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Mark Barden, the co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, hopes the PSA will inspire people to take action", "authors": ["Aben\u00e9 Clayton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/383f93a1826007c42a13daf3eba76a57d366bbe6/164_64_1591_955/master/1591.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7169e48e1f124ee4efb867df85fab3e6", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
