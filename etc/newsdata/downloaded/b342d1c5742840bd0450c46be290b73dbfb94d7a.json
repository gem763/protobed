The order is going into effect before the commission completes its ongoing antitrust investigation of the firm. Broadcom said it will comply, but will appeal the decision. (New York Times)\n\nTalking point: This is a test case for Vestager\u2019s notoriously hardline approach to tech giants\u2014the commissioner, who is set to begin a rare second term in November, signalled stronger and broader oversight in a confirmation hearing last week. Vestager is arguing that because of the lengthy nature of antitrust cases, irreparable harm to competition tends to occur before a probe is complete. In her view, this necessitates the use of interim measures. The commission last tried to impose such an order 18 years ago, but it was thrown out by an EU court after the company involved challenged it.
