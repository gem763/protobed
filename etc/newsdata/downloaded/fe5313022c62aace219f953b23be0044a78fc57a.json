USA TODAY\n\nOdessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said Monday that the gunman had been fired the morning of the shooting. Both he and his employer at Journey Oilfield Services called 911 to complain, but no threats of violence were made. The gunman later called the FBI's tipline.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t speak to his motives or why he called,\u201d Gerke said.\n\nCombs described the calls as \"rambling statements about some of the atrocities that he felt that he had gone through.\"\n\nA Texas Department of Public Safety officer was unaware of those events when he pulled the gunman over 15 minutes later for failing to signal a turn. The man fired on the trooper during the stop and sped away, beginning his massacre.\n\n\u201cHe was on a long spiral of going down,\" Combs said. \"He didn\u2019t wake up Saturday morning and go into his company and then it happened. He went to that company in trouble and had probably been in trouble for a while.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed in a shootout with police following his rampage that spanned 10 miles. Authorities say the gunman fired on other motorists and passers-by around the two Texas cities.\n\nVictims' names released\n\nThe city of Odessa released the names of the victims Monday evening. The victims' ages ranged from 15 to 57.\n\nLeilah Hernandez, 15, celebrated her quincea\u00f1era in May, grandmother, Nora Leyva, told the Washington Post. Leilah's 18-year-old brother, Nathan, was shot in the arm while his arms were around her.\n\nMary Granados, 29, was a postal worker killed in the gunfire, the U.S. Postal Service confirmed. Rosie Granados, Mary's sister, told CNN that she heard Mary scream as she was shot while talking on the phone. \u201cIt was very painful,\u201d Rosie Granados told the news outlet.\n\nJoseph Griffith, 40, was waiting at a traffic light with his wife and two children when he was fatally shot, Carla Byrne \u2013 Griffith's oldest sister \u2013 told the Washington Post. \u201cThis maniac pulled up next to him and shot him, took away his life, murdered my baby brother,\" Griffith told The Post. \"Like nothing. We are so broken.\u201d\n\nA postal worker, 15-year-old student: These are the victims killed in Texas shooting\n\nRodolfo \u201cRudy\u201d Arco, 57, who owned a trucking company in Odessa, was driving Saturday when three bullets were fired at his truck. Two went through the cab and one came through the window and killed him instantly, sister Maria Arco said.\n\nKameron Brown, 30, had survived the deserts of Afghanistan as a U.S. Army soldier.

Abbott read a text from the mother of the child at a news conference Sunday.\n\n\"Thank you all for praying, this is all of our worst nightmare, but thank God she's alive and relatively well,\" Abbott said, reading the woman's message. \"She goes on to say that, 'Toddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play.\"\n\nContributing: John C.
