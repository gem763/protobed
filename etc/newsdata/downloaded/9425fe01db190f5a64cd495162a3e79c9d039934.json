That allows business to consider where best to put their money. An announcement near the end of the tax year encourages individuals to invest for the wrong reason \u2013 tax minimisation, not business development.\n\nIain MacPhedran\n\nHelensburgh, NSW\n\nThe Iraqi blot on Howard\u2019s record\n\nIn a recent interview marking the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Liberal Party, John Howard refused to acknowledge that committing forces to Iraq was a \u201cmisjudgment\u201d.\n\nIn reality, Howard\u2019s decision to join the US and Britain in the invasion of Iraq was a disaster, justified at the time by claims, suspect even then, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe invasion cost hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars, and, arguably, it was an underlying cause of the regional instability that led to the rise of IS.\n\nJohn Howard was one of our most successful prime ministers and there is much he and his government can be proud of. Iraq, however, was a terrible mistake, and it would be refreshing if he finally owned up to it.\n\nPaul Carberry\n\nPlympton, SA\n\nToo much overreach is barely enough\n\nAlexander Downer would presumably extend his argument in \u2018\u2018The overreach of well-meaning global bureaucrats\u2019\u2019 (October 7) to national bureaucrats.\n\nAfter all, they\u2019re the ones who impose on us rules about what side of the road to drive on, whether we can walk into someone else\u2019s house and take what we want, or manufacture poisonous products and trick others into buying them, and so on. They also give us our financial system, our legal system, etc.\n\nWe don\u2019t accept cowboy capitalism nationally, so why should we accept it internationally? Answer: because a productive society \u2013 and especially one we want to live in \u2013 can\u2019t work that way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDarian Hiles\n\nAdelaide, SA\n\nDemocracy\u2019s not about keeping quiet\n\nThere\u2019s a dangerous pattern of intolerance and intimidation emerging from the Morrison government when it comes to not-so-quiet Australians and international organisations challenging or criticising the government\u2019s policies and actions.\n\nThis pattern is dangerous because it undermines fundamental democratic processes and deters people from speaking out against injustice, corruption, malpractice or poor policies and decision-making. Frankly, it is tantamount to authoritarianism.\n\nThat such attitudes and actions arise from the most senior levels of the government should be a concern for all Australians who believe they are living in a democracy.\n\nMark Beavis\n\nMount Evelyn, Vic\n\nFranking credits cut: good policy badly sold\n\nThe ALP seems intent on blaming its policy of abolishing franking credit refunds as a major contributor to its election loss (\u2018\u2018Albo\u2019s 2022 plan\u2019\u2019, October 8). This is a great injustice because reversing an abominable piece of legislation passed under the Howard/Costello government some years ago was and is good policy. Its apparent failure at the last election was due more to Labor\u2019s inability to explain how it would benefit the millions of working Australians.\n\nRoss Kelly\n\nBracken Ridge, Qld\n\nClimate backdown won\u2019t save Labor\n\nIs Joel Fitzgibbon serious, wanting to mimic the government\u2019s climate change \u201cpolicy\u201d so the ALP can win the next election? Apparently it hasn\u2019t occurred to Mr Fitzgibbon that voters didn\u2019t see enough difference between his party and the Coalition in May to warrant changing.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that he is promoting such a non-policy though, given his electorate\u2019s relationship to coal. We might as well wave goodbye to a clean future with these parties ruling politics.\n\nCatherine Moore\n\nBraidwood, NSW", "description": "Energy policy, drought relief, Iraq failures, authoritarianism, Labor policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
