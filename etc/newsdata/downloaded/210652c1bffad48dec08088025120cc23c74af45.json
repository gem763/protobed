Trump said on Twitter Monday that he had no knowledge of the crews' stays at the resort.\n\nCongressional Democrats are also probing refueling expenditures at the airport, which amounted to $16.6 million between Trump's inauguration and June 21 of this year.\n\nAIR FORCE SAYS 'VAST MAJORITY' OF CREWS' OVERNIGHT GLASGOW STAYS WEREN'T AT TRUMP RESORT\n\nOversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. and Civil Rights and Civil Liberties subcommittee chair Jamie Raskin, D-Md., called the Pentagon's response to their requests for information \"woefully inadequate\" in a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\n\nCummings and Raskin summarized that the military used taxpayer dollars to purchase more than 650 rooms at Trump Turnberry since August 2017, \"or the equivalent of one room every night for more than one-and-a-half years,\" based on the 21 pages of documents provided to them, which they say paint an incomplete picture of the spending\n\nThe Air Force told the committee in a letter dated Sept. 12 that expenditures \"specifically associated with the Trump Turnberry....amounted to $124,578.96,\" but have failed to provide specific invoices or travel records, the committee wrote.\n\nThe military also spent \"an additional $59,729.12\" in unspecified charges to government travel cards, the DOD said. The department also told the committee that it spent $3.38 per gallon for fuel at the airport, an \"advantageous\" rate when \"compared to the going commercial rate,\" but the committee said the figures did not provide \"any information on the contemporaneous fuel rates at non-commercial sites, such as military bases elsewhere in Europe.\"\n\n\"It is unclear why the Department has taken so long to produce such rudimentary and deficient information,\" Cummings and Raskin wrote to Esper.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe lawmakers added that the Pentagon's response \"still reveals that far more taxpayer funds have been spent at the President\u2019s resort than previously known ... the data provided by the Department now indicates that U.S. taxpayer funds have been used to pay for more than three dozen separate stays involving hundreds of nights of rooms\u2014all after the President was sworn into office.\"\n\nA preliminary review by the Air Force revealed that its flight crews stayed at the resort up to 40 times between 2015 and 2019, an official told Fox News last week.\n\nCongress has demanded that the Pentagon provide invoices, documents, contracts, agreements and internal and external communications regarding travel and stays at Trump Turnberry by Sept. 27.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "The U.S. military has spent more than $184,000 at President Trump's luxury\u00a0resort in Scotland over the past two years, according to documents the Pentagon provided\u00a0to the House Oversight Committee.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
