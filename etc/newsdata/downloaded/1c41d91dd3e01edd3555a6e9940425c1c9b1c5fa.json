Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the finance committee, documented deep connections between the beleaguered gun group and Maria Butina, who in December pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a Russian agent without registering with the Justice Department. Wyden\u2019s report, released Friday and undertaken without the cooperation of committee Republicans, indicates that greed motivated some NRA officials to engage in the outreach.\n\nButina also made clear to NRA officials long before their controversial Butina-facilitated December 2015 trip to Moscow that Alexander Torshin, her patron and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was a man with mysterious pull in the Kremlin. She emailed former NRA president David Keene in January 2015 that Torshin\u2019s appointment to the Russian central bank was \u201cthe result of a \u2018big game\u2019 in which he has a very important role. All the details we can discuss with you only in person.\u201d\n\nMaria Butina\u2019s Boss Alexander Torshin: The Kremlin\u2019s No-Longer-Secret Weapon\n\n\u201cDuring the 2016 election, Russian nationals effectively used the promise of lucrative personal business opportunities to capture the NRA and gain access to the American political system,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nRepresentatives for the NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to scrutinizing the December 2015 NRA trip, Wyden found that the NRA hosted former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak for a three-hour tour of its headquarters in August 2015. Kislyak was a key figure in Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference before former national security adviser Mike Flynn pleaded guilty to misrepresenting his conversations with him to the FBI. An NRA calendar entry provided to Wyden suggests that NRA leaders took Kislyak hunting at the Grand National Waterfowl Hunt weeks before the Moscow trip.\n\nWyden\u2019s report shows the NRA officials, donors, and supporters meeting with Russian officials under U.S. sanctions during the Moscow trip, something previously reported. But it also shows that Butina ensured the NRA would send sufficiently senior leaders, something necessary to enhance Torshin\u2019s prestige, by dangling opportunities for NRA luminaries to enrich themselves. While U.S. sanctions do not make meeting with foreigners under sanction illegal, U.S. nationals can\u2019t conduct business with them.\n\nReturning from Moscow further inclined the NRA to aid its Russian friend Butina, who presented herself as the head of a rare Russian gun-rights foundation. Soon after, the NRA bought Butina and Torshin memberships in a hunters\u2019 advocacy group known as Safari Club International. Later, one of the key NRA figures on the Moscow trip, Pete Brownell, confirmed to Wyden that he personally introduced Butina to Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA\u2019s 2016 annual meeting, though Brownell\u2019s counsel dismissed it as a \u201cchance encounter.\u201d Butina would also write to NRA heavies for formal invitations to their events, something she said would help her get visas to enter the country.\n\nThe NRA has attempted to distance itself from the Moscow trip after it became politically controversial. It told Wyden\u2019s office in May that any relationship \u201ccertain individuals, including NRA supporters and volunteers\u201d had with Butina and Torshin was entirely distinct from NRA business.\n\nYet Wyden\u2019s report shows then-NRA president Allan Cors, who backed out of the trip, contemporaneously referring to it in an email to Torshin as a chance to \u201crepresent the NRA\u201d to influential Russians. Among those Russians were Butina\u2019s reputed moneyman, Igor Pisarsky, whom Butina presented as Putin\u2019s \u201ccampaign manager\u201d; the sanctioned Russian deputy prime minister for the defense industry, Dmitry Rogozin; and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Documentation the NRA provided, the report notes, did not show \u201caction to discourage or prevent its officers from using organization resources to explore business opportunities or to meet with sanctioned individuals and entities\u201d during the trip.", "description": "Pavel Ptitsin/APTies between the National Rifle Association and influential Russians were substantial and potentially lucrative enough to render the politically potent gun lobby an \u201casset\u201d of Russia, according to a Senate Democrat\u2019s year-plus investigation.\u00a0More than 4,000 pages of NRA records provided", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/np2nYA7SCuELp.YGvnR21A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/6ef736c3672a8207a09252174472fafe", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
