Photo: HBO\n\nWhen you\u2019re applying for a new job and your dad is your perspective boss, every single day is an interview. Such is life for Siobhan \u201cShiv\u201d Roy of HBO\u2019s Succession. Shiv was promised the keys to her family\u2019s kingdom, and has since made an effort to dress the part. Lucky for her, the rest of her family has a lot of money and zero taste, so as long as she can avoid sabotage and a mortifying desire to rap about her father, she\u2019s the most-obvious candidate.\n\nIn a former life as a political adviser to a progressive candidate, Shiv wore a lot of liberal-leaning ponchos. Now, she\u2019s got a new haircut and a more masculine uniform, which includes high-waisted wool pants so sharp, they could run their own company. And, like every formidable and duplicitous leader in history, Shiv has started wearing a lot of turtlenecks. So far, they\u2019ve played a supporting role, neatly framing her blunt bob and blue-eyed death stares. (As costume designer Michelle Matland told the Cut, they\u2019re meant to focus the viewer\u2019s attention on her glorious boss pants.) But on Sunday night\u2019s episode, Shiv\u2019s backless turt stole the show, fucking us, to quote Shiv herself, from 100 different directions at 1,000 miles per hour. This turt is so powerful, so robust, it\u2019s the self-appointed president and CEO of Turtlenecktown. And also just nominated itself for a Golden Globe.\n\nA scene from season 2 episode 8 of Succession. Photo: HBO\n\nIn the beginning of episode 8 (\u201cDundee\u201d), Shiv wears a matching blue vest over her backless turt, so no one suspects what\u2019s underneath. (It\u2019s also possible she\u2019s wearing a different turt.) It\u2019s got shoulder pads, a belted waist, and also appears to be a dress? The versatility! Shiv tries to reason with her siblings, telling them that Rhea Jarrell, who stabbed her in the back and stole what was promised to her, is bad for business. But they see right through her, and her vest. It\u2019s clear from this look that Shiv has something up her sleeve.\n\nA scene from season 2 episode 8 of Succession.

(\u201cAre you regularly tested for sexually transmitted diseases?\u201d) Meanwhile, Logan\u2019s brother uses his grandson, Cousin Greg, as a pawn to get under his skin, which leads us to \u201cGrexit.\u201d The only one who\u2019s not deeply up to something is Kendall, who is back to shamelessly rapping and walking around with a stupid grin on his face. He just can\u2019t help himself, can he?\n\nA scene from season 2 episode 8 of Succession. Photo: HBO\n\nA scene from season 2 episode 8 of Succession.

It\u2019s unthreatening and professional in the front, and dangerously seductive in the back. It will pimp out your husband and throw him to the wolves. It will pour you a glass of Champagne and make you wonder if it\u2019s poisoned. Most importantly, though, it allows Shiv to dress for the job she wants, believably turn it down when she realizes it\u2019s a bad play, and then walk away unscathed.
