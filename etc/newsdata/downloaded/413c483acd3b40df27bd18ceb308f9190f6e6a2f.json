Doctors think one brother contracted the disease in prison and then spread it around the family when he returned home.\n\nCases of the \u201cwhite death\u201d illness, closely linked to malnutrition and poor housing, have been on the rise since the turn of the decade as Latin America\u2019s third-largest economy has been battered by repeat recessions and inflation.\n\nCurrently, fast-rising prices and recession are driving more people below the poverty line and stoking homelessness and hunger. The poverty rate stood at above 35 percent in the first half of the year, hurting Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who is expected to lose the general elections on Sunday.\n\nBrigida Simaniz (not pictured) watches over her son Nicolas as he is examined in March by Laura Lagrutta, a pulmonologist specializing in children with tuberculosis, at Dr. Raul Vaccarezza Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The number of cases, which had dropped steadily since the 1980s, started to rise again after 2010.\n\nTuberculosis kills 5,000 people every day globally and is one of the world\u2019s biggest killers.\n\nFarm-rich Argentina is still better off than some of its South American neighbors, including Brazil and Peru, where incidence of the disease is higher. But the infection rate in Argentina is rising at a worrisome pace.\n\nMarcela Natiello, coordinator of the national TB and leprosy control program, said a declining trend since the 1980s had reversed in 2013, linked to \u201cmultiple and complex causes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTB primarily affects the most vulnerable populations with low economic resources, residing in poor, badly ventilated and overcrowded environments,\u201d she said, adding that over half of all cases were in the populous area around Buenos Aires.\n\nMariela, an infectious disease specialist intern, analyzes an X-ray of 24-year-old patient Jorge, who is currently undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Jan. 29, 2019.

She says her now-months-old baby luckily did not get infected.", "description": "In a poor Buenos Aires suburb, Cristian Molina\u2019s jeans and denim jacket hide his unhealthily slight frame, his legacy from years of a poor diet that left him susceptible to the tuberculosis infection he contracted earlier this year, a disease of poverty that is making a comeback in Argentina.", "authors": ["Yahoo News Photo Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TRIj7rjd.Nq4lxH65Rp_8w--~B/aD00MDE2O3c9NjAxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/14c9f2a0-f670-11e9-8fff-d8d416ca331b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
