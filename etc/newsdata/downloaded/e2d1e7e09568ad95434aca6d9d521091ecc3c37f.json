It's an \"amoebozoa,\" which is the kingdom used to classify organisms that are neither plant nor animal.\n\nSlime molds have existed on Earth for billions of years, and they're found naturally in temperate climates, Dussutour says. But the blob has captivated the public and researchers alike because of its almost mystical properties and abilities.\n\nFor example, the blob can regenerate after a dormant period so it doesn't age, Dussutour says. And it only contains one cell but spans a few square meters and holds billions of nuclei.\n\nBut perhaps most impressively, The Blob doesn't have a brain or nervous system, it doesn't have eyes, ears or a mouth \u2014 but it can learn.\n\n\"When slime molds are placed in a new environment, they'll spread out in every direction, assessing the environment,\" Dussutour says. \"If they find something they like, they'll reinforce the pathway. If they find something they don't like they'll retract.\"", "description": "Physarum polycephalum, aka \"The Blob,\" is on display at the Paris Zoological Park now through Nov. 3. It's a slime mold that's capable of moving, making decisions and regenerating, all without a brain and nervous system. Here's why this mysterious mold's capabilities could have practical uses too.", "authors": ["Cory Stieg"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106195976-1571756858538gettyimages-1176167717.jpeg?v=1571756909", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
