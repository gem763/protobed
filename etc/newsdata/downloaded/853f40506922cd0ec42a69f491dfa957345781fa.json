She is probably best known for Yananyi Dreaming, the design that covers a Qantas Boeing 737. She has also been on the board of management of Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park.\n\nShe talks about the importance of the inma \u2013 not to show the visiting VIPs that their culture is strong \u2013 but to show Anangu children.\n\n\u201cThe dances they will be doing as small children today are the ones that they will carry with them and continue to dance throughout their lives,\u201d Kulitja says. \u201cThese are the inma that our grandfathers and grandmothers entrusted to us to hold and pass on.\n\n\u201cWe hold this inma in our minds and in our sprit, so that we can sing, we can dance, we can give them to the children of the future. So it is for our children that we are most excited. We are going to be dancing for them, for the children.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The night sky over Uluru after the first full day of the climbing ban on Saturday.

Anangu feel a deep happiness at the closing, Kulitja says, and the chance to practise culture and law for the occasion is exciting.\n\n\u201cWhat I feel is the strength of the inma that my grandfathers and grandmothers held and passed on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something from an ancient past that\u2019s still really important into the present. I\u2019ll never abandon my traditions and my culture, it\u2019s something that I hold very firmly in my spirit, and I\u2019m feeling very, very happy at the moment.\u201d\n\nAt Mutijulu on Saturday night, Anangu celebrated with a big barbecue and dance-off.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s sinking into people and they\u2019re never going to forget this,\u2019 Elsie Taylor says.

We are giving to to you, it\u2019s yours to hold and pass on in turn now.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt sunset on Sunday, Australia\u2019s environment minister, Sussan Ley, the Labor senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy, and the Labor MP Linda Burney, as well as the Northern Territory\u2019s chief minister, Michael Gunner, will attend the official ceremony.\n\nThe Central Australian Aboriginal Women\u2019s Choir will also sing.
