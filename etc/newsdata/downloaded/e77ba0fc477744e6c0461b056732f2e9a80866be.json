The goal is to show a side of the California senator that\u2019s not always captured in TV segments or on debate stages \u2014 and which aides believe distinguishes her from top presidential rivals. The events also tie into Harris\u2019 \u201c3 a.m.\u201d policy agenda \u2014 the pocketbook worries that keep voters up at night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about, \u2018Let me talk about myself,\u201d a Harris adviser involved in the planning told POLITICO. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018I understand your problems on a human level in a way that you experience them.\u2019 Their concern is not, 'I need broad systemic overhauls,' it\u2019s, 'I can\u2019t get a job, or I can\u2019t pay the bills this month, or I can\u2019t pay my student loans, or my yard is flooded.'\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a fundamentally different conversation when you\u2019re sitting around someone\u2019s kitchen table in their home,\u201d the adviser added.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

She\u2019ll spend more time with campaign organizers and volunteers at field offices and canvassing events, including an upcoming breakfast with \"Women for Kamala\" precinct captains.\n\nHarris, an avid cook who collects new recipes from the road, is also planning to help prepare Sunday suppers in peoples\u2019 homes.\n\nAides said she'll continue to hold bigger events across the state. The planned meetings come as Harris, a former prosecutor and California attorney general, steps up her cable show appearances as a kind of legal analyst for Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings. On Thursday, she appeared on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nOn the road, Harris has taken to reminding audiences of her first campaign for San Francisco district attorney when she was similarly mired in the mid-single digits. She passed out leaflets at transit stops and used an ironing board as a standing desk.\n\nHarris\u2019 presidential campaign has dabbled in smaller informal events but hasn\u2019t made them part of a concerted effort. With the exception of a five-day bus tour timed around the Iowa State Fair and Wing Ding dinner, the majority of her early-state trips have been shorter jaunts where she\u2019s headlined large town halls.\n\nAfter using the summer to raise money \u2014 going long stretches away from the campaign trail \u2014 Harris\u2019 aides have acknowledged she needs to be on TV and on the ground more. She'll make weekly visits to Iowa as part of a fall push in which the campaign is nearly doubling its operation, from 65 to 120, and opening new field offices. They are aiming for a top-three finish there to vault Harris forward in the primary.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/51/66/29cc87d145198fe0c046d89d3cc1/19103-kamala-harris-gty-773.jpg"}
