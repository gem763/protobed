Consider that the Bloomberg Barclays Germany Treasury Bond Index began the year with a -0.1% yield, but has returned over 6% in euros year to date through August 12. Negative yielding bonds may not be attractive for most individual investors if held to maturity, but their prices may still rise over shorter periods, giving them value if used judiciously in diversified portfolios.\n\nI don't get it. Bonds are not growth investments; they are contractual instruments. At the end maturity date, you get back par, barring default. So with a $1000 face bond, you get back $1000 in principal at the end. However, to have a negative interest rate bond (most do not have actual negative coupons) the bond must be selling above par. Like $1075 per bond.
