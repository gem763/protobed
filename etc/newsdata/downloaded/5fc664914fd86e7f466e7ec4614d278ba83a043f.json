REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThe warning from the watchdog comes as it found that social media posts, especially on TikTok, are increasingly featuring flight attendants grooving to popular tunes or lip-syncing movie dialogues while inside an aircraft.\n\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all airlines to rein in such behaviour and will soon seek a compliance report, said a senior official at the department.\n\n\u201cWe have issued instructions and told them these are unbecoming,\u201d a DGCA official said, adding that a letter had also been sent to airlines about such \u201ctheatrical performances\u201d by crew members which could risk passenger safety.\n\nA TikTok video showing a SpiceJet cabin crew member smiling and walking down the aisle of an airplane full of passengers was reported by local Indian media this week, drawing criticism by people on social media.\n\nSpiceJet Ltd said in a statement on Friday that its crew is strictly prohibited from shooting pictures or videos on-board and it takes strict action against violators.\n\nAirAsia India said it ensures that its staff adheres to strict internal guidelines for social media usage.\n\nIndigo said it had received the communication from the aviation regulator and will take appropriate action where required.\n\nOwned by China\u2019s ByteDance, TikTok is one of the world\u2019s most popular apps. It has become a sensation in India, where it has been downloaded by more than 350 million times, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThe app allows users to post short videos with special effects. Hashtags such as #crewlife, #flightattendant are often used for videos involving airline crew and have around 170 million views on the platform.\n\nThis week, Reuters found dozens of videos that showed crew from airlines such as IndiGo, AirAsia India and Vistara, part-owned by Singapore Airlines, singing, dancing or ramp walking along an aircraft\u2019s aisle.\n\nVistara, as well as TikTok, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne TikTok video from a user, who identifies herself as \u201c#Dancer #cabincrew #indigo\u201d, shows her and another flight attendant wearing uniform and grooving to a Bollywood song inside a plane and blowing a kiss to the camera.\n\nIn another video, a woman TikTok user wearing a shirt with a Vistara logo, and a fluorescent safety jacket on top, is seen dancing to a popular DJ Snake song on an airport apron, with a plane seen in the background.\n\nVistara\u2019s chief strategy officer Sanjiv Kapoor earlier this year shared guidelines with staff for social media posts, saying only photos which represent the airline in a positive light may be shared, an internal e-mail showed.\n\n\u201cAny photos you post must be classy. No sultry photos please,\u201d Kapoor wrote in his e-mail.", "description": "India's aviation regulator is concerned about several videos on popular Chinese video app TikTok that show flight crew singing and dancing while on duty, and has asked airlines to take action in the interest of passenger safety, a senior official told Reuters.", "authors": ["Aditi Shah", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431948620&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0S3", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
