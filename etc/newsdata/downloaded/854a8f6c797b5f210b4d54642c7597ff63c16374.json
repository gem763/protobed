They're not going to discuss it with me.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThough Trump was breaking from decades of precedent by not putting his holdings into a \"blind trust,\" Morgan Lewis and Bockius partner Shari Dillon explained that she and her colleagues, with the approval of Presidential Transition Team attorney \u2014 and former White House Counsel Fred Fielding \u2014 had designed \"a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.\"\n\n\"Through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump,\" said Dillon, who added that any \"new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns\" would require the written approval of an ethics adviser.\n\nOver the 1,004 days he has been in office, Trump's response to the myriad examples of how his businesses have benefited from his occupying the highest office in the land has been to repeatedly insist that he gave up control of his hotel, golf and real estate empire to his sons. But thanks to his itchy Twitter finger and his most senior assistant, we now know that like most things that come out of his mouth (or phone), his repeated statements insisting that he'd separated himself from his businesses were lies.\n\nOn Thursday, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney appeared at a hastily called press briefing, his first since taking on the role. The subject at hand was one which he'd originally intended to discuss with a select group of reporters, in private, off-camera, and \"on background\" as a \"senior administration official.\"\n\nBut instead \u2014 and at Trump's urging, according to a White House source \u2014 Mulvaney took to the James Brady Briefing Room to announce that Trump National Doral Miami, a luxury golf resort in Florida, had been determined to be \"by far and away \u2014 far and away \u2014 the best physical facility\" for next year's G7 summit.\n\nNumerous ethics experts and constitutional scholars have argued that Trump's continued ownership stake in the Trump Organization has been a running violation of the US Constitution's emoluments clauses, which prohibit the President \u2014 as a \"Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust\" in the US government \u2014 from receiving \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever\" from \"from any King, Prince, or foreign State\" or from receiving any compensation outside his salary.\n\nBut Mulvaney suggested that hosting the event at Doral, which has struggled financially in the years since the Trump Organization purchased it, would not violate the Emoluments Clauses of the constitution and would be \"dramatically cheaper for us\" compared with sites he would not name in California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah, because \"the President\" \u2014 not the Trump Organization \u2014 \u201ccould actually do it at no cost.\"\n\nTwo days later, having been told by a number of moderate Republicans that the plan was not politically defensible, Trump did something uncharacteristic: He backed down.\n\n\"I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\" he tweeted. \"Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!\"\n\nTrump's insistence that he would have been willing to use Doral \u2014 which he claimed to have given up control over before he took office \u2014 at \"no profit\" or \"zero cost to the USA\" completely contradicts the assurances given by Dillon, his attorney, at his January 11, 2017 press conference.\n\nMulvaney all but confirmed that Trump still retains some measure of control over his hotel empire on Sunday, telling Fox News' Chris Wallace that Trump \"still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d And Trump seemed to confirm himself during a cabinet meeting on Monday by boasting that \"I have a great business\" and telling reporters that he \"would have given it [Doral] for nothing.\"\n\nHe also mocked the assembled members of the White House press corps for asking about his now-rescinded decision and suggesting that it would have violated Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the US Constitution. \u201cYou people with this phony Emoluments Clause,\" he said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint.
