Clothing must flatter, but short skirts are a no-no. After all, \u201csexuality scrambles the mind.\u201d Women should look healthy and fit, with a \u201cgood haircut\u201d and \u201cmanicured nails.\u201d\n\nThese were just a few pieces of advice that around 30 female executives at Ernst & Young received at a training held in the accounting giant\u2019s gleaming new office in Hoboken, New Jersey, in June 2018.\n\nThe 55-page presentation, used during the day-and-a-half seminar on leadership and empowerment, was given to HuffPost by an attendee who was appalled by its contents. Full of out-of-touch advice, the presentation focused on how women need to fix themselves to fit into a male-dominated workplace.\n\nThe training, called Power-Presence-Purpose or PPP, took place during the height of the Me Too movement when sexual misconduct accusations dominated the news. In response, large corporations, including EY, shored up their sexual harassment policies and training. A few companies banned forced arbitration over allegations of sex discrimination and assault. Some men were fired.\n\nWomen\u2019s brains absorb information like pancakes soak up syrup so it\u2019s hard for them to focus, the attendees were told. Men\u2019s brains are more like waffles. They\u2019re better able to focus because the information collects in each little waffle square.\n\nEY, one of the largest accounting firms in the world with $36.4 billion in global revenue and 270,000 employees, was still recovering from a public Me Too accusation. A few months before the seminar, the company was in the news for settling a discrimination complaint filed by Jessica Casucci, a partner at the firm who said she was sexually assaulted by a male partner. The incident happened years before and Casucci complained internally. EY fired the man only after she went public.\n\nThe June 2018 event did not touch on any of these topics, however. The focus was on self-improvement. For women.\n\nAfter HuffPost inquired about the training in early October of this year, EY said that the course had been under review for months, that the June 2018 event was the last time that version of the training was held at the company and that the course \u201cis no longer offered in its current form.\u201d The company did not provide any more detail on the changes.\n\nThe training was just one of many that the firm offered to men and women, EY told HuffPost. PPP was created by someone outside the company, \u201can external vendor,\u201d EY said, and offered because some women requested it.\n\nThe company said it disagrees with the way the content of the seminar is characterized in this story. \u201cAny isolated aspects are taken wholly out of context,\u201d EY said in a statement. The company said it reviewed the evaluations of women who participated in the program, and found they rated it highly. EY\u2019s communications team also shared quotes from two current employees, who praised the training.\n\n\u201cProfessionally, PPP was the most impactful leadership program that I have had the opportunity to participate in and I have always been incredibly proud and humbled to have been a part of it,\u201d EY senior executive Stacey Moore, who participated in the training four years ago, said in a statement provided by company. \u201cI am forever grateful to the firm for the opportunity and the investment in our women.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some EY partners include references to the PPP program on their LinkedIn pages. In May, female EY employees gathered for a PPP reunion and \u201cgraduation.\u201d A LinkedIn post from one EY employee about that gathering says that more than 150 women have taken the course.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of our long-standing commitment to women and deeply committed to creating and fostering an environment of inclusivity and belonging at EY, anything that suggests the contrary is 100% false,\u201d the firm said in its statement to HuffPost.\n\nISABELLA CARAPELLA / HUFFPOST The 55-page presentation offered at Ernst & Young featured advice on how to dress.\n\nDon\u2019t Show Your Distracting Skin\n\nThe training was billed to participants as advice on how to be successful at EY, according to Jane, a training attendee and former executive director at the firm who\u2019s in her early 40s. Though she\u2019s since left the firm, Jane asked to use a pseudonym, fearing career reprisals.\n\nAfter she attended the event, Jane said a male EY partner told her, derisively, that it was a \u201cmale-bashing\u201d program. With hindsight, Jane realized he had it wrong. \u201cIt was more of a woman-bashing event, ironically enough,\u201d she said.\n\nErnst & Young hired an outside consultant, Marsha Clark (not that one), to teach promising women at EY how to grow their networks, negotiate and \u201cbuild stronger, high-performing teams,\u201d according to the written presentation.\n\nIt should be noted that presentation doesn\u2019t even consider the existence of people who identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming. And it doesn\u2019t delve into how women may be treated differently based on race or sexual orientation.\n\nOne section of the document is devoted to women\u2019s appearance: Be \u201cpolished,\u201d have a \u201cgood haircut, manicured nails, well-cut attire that complements your body type,\u201d it states on Page 36. But then, a warning: \u201cDon\u2019t flaunt your body \u2015 sexuality scrambles the mind (for men and women).\u201d\n\nThe most important thing women can do is \u201csignal fitness and wellness,\u201d the presentation continues.\n\nJane recalls being told that if you want men to focus on the substance of what you\u2019re talking about, \u201cdon\u2019t show skin.\u201d If you do, men are less likely to focus \u201cbecause of sex,\u201d Jane recalls being told. The advice made her \u201cfeel like a piece of meat,\u201d she said.\n\nA long list of \u201cInvisible Rules\u201d for men and women on Page 13 paints a bleak portrait of contrasting communication styles. It says that women often \u201cspeak briefly\u201d and \u201coften ramble and miss the point\u201d in meetings. By comparison, a man will \u201cspeak at length \u2015 because he really believes in his idea.\u201d Women don\u2019t interrupt effectively like men. Women \u201cwait their turn (that never comes) and raise their hands.\u201d\n\nISABELLA CARAPELLA / HUFFPOST An assessment of women's speaking style in the \"Invisible Rules\" section of the EY presentation.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the presentation if these \u201crules\u201d are offered as legitimate expectations or false stereotypes. Jane said it was the former when she took the course. The presentation has a few \u201cdiscussion questions\u201d that ask women how these rules manifest in their organization and \u201chow can you \u2018manage\u2019 yourself now that you\u2019re aware of the \u2018rules.\u2019\u201d But there\u2019s little that suggests the \u201crules\u201d can be broken \u2015 only that women need to navigate through a world structured by these rules.\n\nDon\u2019t Be Aggressive Like Men\n\nBefore the workshop, women were also given a \u201cMasculine/Feminine Score Sheet,\u201d which had them rate their adherence to stereotypical masculine and feminine characteristics both on the job and outside the office.\n\nThe so-called masculine traits included \u201cActs as a Leader,\u201d \u201cAggressive,\u201d \u201cAmbitious,\u201d \u201cAnalytical,\u201d \u201cHas Leadership Abilities,\u201d \u201cStrong Personality\u201d and \u201cWilling to Take a Stand.\u201d\n\nThe so-called feminine traits included \u201cAffectionate,\u201d \u201cCheerful,\u201d \u201cChildlike,\u201d \u201cCompassionate,\u201d \u201cGullible,\u201d \u201cLoves Children\u201d and \u201cYielding.\u201d None of the feminine traits involved leadership \u2015 ostensibly a focus of the training.\n\nISABELLA CARAPELLA / HUFFPOST Women were asked to score themselves on this list of allegedly feminine and masculine traits.\n\nJane said the message was that women will be penalized, by both men and women, if they don\u2019t adhere to feminine characteristics or if they display more masculine traits. And that if you want to be successful, you have to keep this in mind.\n\nClark declined to talk with HuffPost about the presentation, but it appears to be in line with other workshops she\u2019s given, based on an examination of some of the materials posted online by her consulting firm, Marsha Clark & Associates.\n\nClark touts her own business experience as critical to her consulting expertise. According to her website bio, she served as an executive at Electronic Data Systems, the Texas technology company founded by Ross Perot, for 21 years before striking out on her own as a consultant in 2000.\n\nWorking as one of the few women in the C-suites of the Texas tech industry in the 1980s and 1990s would have been a sexist minefield. That experience may be why Clark\u2019s advice still follows an older approach of telling women how to navigate within stereotypes rather than confronting them more directly.\n\n\u201cMarsha\u2019s background as an executive in both line and staff roles, as well as her academic training, provides a unique combination of skills and experience to offer her clients,\u201d her bio says.\n\nAmong the other credentials listed on Clark\u2019s site are a master\u2019s of science in organizational development from American University and various corporate and professional certifications, including for the Myers-Briggs test, one of the most popular and most debunked personality tests used in the business world. Clark\u2019s website also lists a host of blue-chip clients including JPMorganChase, Microsoft and Pepsico.\n\nWhile EY said this week that the company no longer offers Clark\u2019s PPP training in its current form, it\u2019s not clear whether this means EY has stopped working with Clark. The company did not answer that question. As recently as Oct. 2, she appears to have attended another workshop with EY that touched on \u201cinvisible differences,\u201d according to her LinkedIn page.\n\nDon\u2019t Talk To Men Face-To-Face\n\nJane said that at the PPP training she attended last year, Clark coached the group in how to interact with men in the workplace \u2015 advice that Jane wrote down in her notes and shared with HuffPost:\n\nDon\u2019t directly confront men in meetings, because men perceive this as threatening. (Women do not.) Meet before (or after) the meeting instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re having a conversation with a man, cross your legs and sit at an angle to him. Don\u2019t talk to a man face-to-face. Men see that as threatening.\n\nDon\u2019t be too aggressive or outspoken.\n\n\u201cYou have to offer your thoughts in a benign way,\u201d Jane said, recalling the seminar. \u201cYou have to be the perfect Stepford wife.\u201d It felt like they were being turned into someone who is \u201csuper-smiley, who never confronts anyone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be the stereotype of what a woman is,\u201d Jane said. Like the worksheet described it, she added.\n\nAttendees were even told that women\u2019s brains are 6% to 11% smaller than men\u2019s, Jane said. She wasn\u2019t sure why they were told this, nor is it clear from the presentation. Women\u2019s brains absorb information like pancakes soak up syrup so it\u2019s hard for them to focus, the attendees were told. Men\u2019s brains are more like waffles. They\u2019re better able to focus because the information collects in each little waffle square.\n\nThe only reason to talk to women about their size of their brains is to make them feel inferior to men, said Bruce McEwen, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University. \u201cIt\u2019s implying their brains don\u2019t work as well,\u201d he said, but in fact there is no link between size and function. \u201cBrain size is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nHuffPost reached out to several other women who attended the PPP training. None responded.\n\nLet\u2019s Debunk Ideas About Women At Work\n\nStereotypes about how women behave at work \u2015 they don\u2019t ask for what they want, they don\u2019t negotiate, they\u2019re more caring \u2015 are popular. They\u2019re also largely false and misunderstood, said Robin Ely, a professor at Harvard Business School who researches the role of gender in organizations and has taught leadership training for women.\n\nEly reviewed the EY presentation at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of empirical support that there are trait differences between men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cThis curriculum is shot through with that assumption.\u201d\n\nEly recently published a paper debunking other beliefs about women in the workplace, such as the claims that they\u2019re bad negotiators or lack confidence \u2013 both ideas in the EY presentation. Often, it\u2019s company culture, not inherent gender differences, the professor said, that create situations in which women appear to lack confidence or ambition.\n\n\u201cYou look at what happens in meetings in such cultures. It\u2019s not lack of confidence. It\u2019s when women say something, it\u2019s more harshly criticized,\u201d Ely said. \u201cIf a guy says anything, it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nEly\u2019s earlier research into law firms found that stereotypes were more strongly believed in those firms that had the smallest percentage of female partners. When there were just a few token higher-level women, she wrote, it gave everyone fewer examples of what female professionals look like. People resorted to stereotypes.\n\nHuffPost also showed the EY presentation to Evelyn Carter, a senior consultant at Paradigm, a diversity and inclusion consulting firm that\u2019s worked with companies like Twitter, Slack and Zillow.\n\nCarter said female empowerment training should take note of gender stereotypes in the workplace, and the EY presentation did this. But instead of teaching women how to dismantle those stereotypes, the EY presentation appears to advise women how to live with them.\n\n\u201cI think the goal of women\u2019s empowerment is to go beyond \u2018you should do it this way to exist in a man\u2019s world,\u2019\u201d Carter said.\n\nMany women really do enjoy empowerment programs, said Deborah Kolb, a professor emerita at Simmons College School of Management who has been organizing and running executive education programs for women for decades.\n\nBut once they leave a program with a \u201cfix the women\u201d approach, disillusionment sets in. \u201cYou feel good, but then you realize it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Kolb, who has advised companies like Deloitte, Time Warner and Eli Lilly.\n\nWhen Ely does training for female executives, she said she tries to actually focus on leadership, looking at how they can create the conditions for their teams to thrive, particularly those team members who are also women or others who have been disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, you\u2019re enabling other people, creating conditions for other people to bring their best selves forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they follow you.\u201d\n\nYou Have To \u2018Work Around The Men\u2019\n\nEY has positioned itself as a company that is enlightened about women, frequently marketing its take on the value of women in business with hashtags (#WomenFastForward), surveys and programs. In a statement to HuffPost, it said, \u201cEY has been \u2015 and remains \u2015 a highly recognized and award-winning leader in fostering a culture that promotes inclusion and a strong sense of belonging for all. We are, and remain, unrelenting in our effort to continue to set the standard for a best-in-class culture and work environment.\u201d\n\nYet the firm has very few women in its higher ranks. Jane said that nearly all of the partners on the EY teams she worked on were male. Women make up only 12% of EY\u2019s lead client service partners, according to the company\u2019s own data from fiscal year 2018. The numbers for other top jobs are only slightly better. Overall, just 20.4% of EY\u2019s partners and principals are women. (A lack of women in key roles is an industry-wide problem for accounting firms.)\n\nJane empathizes with Karen Ward, a former partner at EY who has said she was sexually harassed by a boss and then retaliated against when she complained to other senior partners, which HuffPost detailed in an investigation earlier this year. EY denies Ward\u2019s charges.\n\nWard filed sex discrimination charges against the firm in 2018 and was forced to take her case to arbitration rather than to court. Because of onerous terms in her employment contract, she\u2019s had to spend nearly $200,000 so far just to have her complaint heard.\n\nJane said she wasn\u2019t explicitly sexually harassed at EY, but she faced discrimination. She was isolated by her male colleagues, left out of important meetings, made to sit along the wall in conference rooms and even told not to speak unless spoken to during conversations with clients, she told HuffPost.\n\nOther women at the PPP training told her those experiences were standard at EY, she said. \u201cThe only way to succeed is to work around the men. I heard that over and over,\u201d Jane said.\n\nAlthough the firm could not address Jane\u2019s specific claims without knowing her identity, EY said it \u201cthoroughly\u201d investigates any claims brought to its attention and imposes \u201charsh sanctions\u201d when its policies are violated.\n\nHow To Make Women Feel Like Failures\n\nFor as long as there have been women in business, there have been experts telling them how to behave in order to get ahead.\n\nNot that long ago, women were told to look and act more like men: wear shoulder pads, learn to golf. Then they were told they weren\u2019t succeeding because so many of them were \u201copting out\u201d to have babies. More recently, Sheryl Sandberg told women they just needed to \u201clean in\u201d and be more ambitious.\n\nNone of that did much more than make each successive generation of women feel like failures. But over the past decade, there has been more in-depth research showing that it\u2019s not women holding themselves back \u2015 it\u2019s an entire system designed to keep them in place.\n\nOrganizations built and run by men tend to exhibit entrenched biases that value confidence and assertiveness in men while penalizing those traits in women; judge men based on their potential, while assessing women on what they\u2019ve already accomplished; insist on work hours that cater to men with wives at home taking care of everything else; and, of course, ignore when women are sexually harassed \u2015 far more often than anyone was willing to admit until very recently.\n\nThe reasons that women hit a dead end in the corporate world have little to do with their outfits, their negotiating skills or the way they stand when talking to a man. And yet the idea that women just need to do better persists. That\u2019s partly because there is something appealing about the idea that an individual can fix these issues. It is empowering to be told that the key to your success is in your hands.\n\nBut what Kolb and other researchers have found is that advancing women in an organization requires work on the part of the whole organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding the social context within which you\u2019re working and giving people strategies to succeed within that context,\u201d she said. Companies need to look at how they make hiring and promotion decisions, how performance reviews are conducted, even how meetings are scheduled.\n\nJane, for example, said that even after she told her team that early morning meetings didn\u2019t work for her, because she had to get her kids off to school, she was never accommodated. A number of regularly recurring meetings were scheduled between 8 and 9 a.m.\n\n\u201cI was the only woman on the team with young kids. They said it would be ridiculous to schedule just for one person,\u201d she said.\n\nOver her time at EY, Jane said her confidence was shattered. \u201cThey convinced me I had the worst personality,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was gutting.\u201d\n\nShe has a new job now. \u201cI\u2019m finding my sea legs slowly,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are happy with my work. I think I\u2019m gaining trust.\u201d\n\nAs for her former employer, Jane said she was sharing the training document in the hopes the company would reconsider some of its practices. \u201cI just want EY to change,\u201d she said.\n\nAre you a woman in the corporate world who\u2019s experienced harassment in the workplace?
