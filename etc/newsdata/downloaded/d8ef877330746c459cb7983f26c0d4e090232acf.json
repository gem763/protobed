Impeachment, Trump said, is a \u201cbad thing to have on your resume,\u201d according to a source on the call. Two other sources on the call confirmed the substance of the comment, but one said they recalled Trump phrasing it as \u201cyou don\u2019t want it [impeachment] on your resume.\u201d\n\nAfter making the resume remark, Trump added, \u201cBut it\u2019s going to make Kevin speaker,\u201d these sources said, a reference to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s upside.\n\nWhy it matters: These two Trump quotes might seem like throwaways on what was a lengthy and discursive call with allies. But sources who have discussed impeachment candidly with the president say these comments perfectly encapsulate how Trump feels about it: He believes it could help him get re-elected and win back the House.
