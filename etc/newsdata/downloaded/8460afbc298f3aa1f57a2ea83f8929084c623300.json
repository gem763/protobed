It was 1999 and the height of rap rock and nu metal, of Limp Bizkit and Korn, of hirsute man-boys with snapback hats and chain wallets. Piepenbring\u2019s curiosity was aroused by something else \u2013 a record called Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic. \u201cThe singer was wearing a blue shiny outfit,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNot quite superhuman, but extraterrestrial. He had no name and looked so effeminate. He seemed to be of indeterminate ethnic origin. And I was a little afraid. He just seemed so weird. I remember handling the CD on successive visits to the store and thinking, \u2018What is this?\u2019 It was so gloriously out of sync with everything else on the shelves.\u201d\n\nThat was Piepenbring\u2019s first encounter with Prince. In 2004, he listened to Purple Rain and was smitten. \u201cI became obsessed,\u201d he says over hamburger and fries in a Greenwich Village bar. Now 33, he has the underfed eloquence of the eternal postgrad. \u201cI had this sense that I was listening to someone who combined so many fascinating strains of popular music, from the last 50 years, in an original package.\u201d In 2016, Piepenbring was working as an editor at the New York-based literary journal Paris Review, when his agent told him Prince was searching for a co-writer to work on his memoir. He turned in a pitch-cum-love-letter: \u201cFrom my first encounter with Prince I knew he was a master storyteller,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo help him tell his stories in a new mode would be a once-in-a-lifetime honour.\u201d\n\nLess than a day later, he was summoned to meet the singer at his Paisley Park complex in Minnesota. He got the assignment. What followed he describes as a \u201cbizarre, three-month detour in my life, a strange and voluptuous period. And so surreal.\u201d\n\nPiepenbring and Prince went to concerts, parties and a private screening of Kung Fu Panda 3 together\n\nPiepenbring was a surprising choice, being all the things Prince was not: white, young, college-educated, outside the musical world, completely unknown. But Prince was famously secretive about his life, as well as dismissive of interviewers. He described writers as \u201cmamma-jammas wearing glasses and an alligator shirt behind a typewriter\u201d and claimed, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a critic can tell me that I can learn from.\u201d Piepenbring remembers him saying that he regarded most of what had been written about him as \u201cgarbage\u201d. The Paris Review is best known for its extended interviews with authors, but this did not stop the young editor becoming Prince\u2019s amenuensis. \u201cMy first Monday coming back from Paisley Park, we gave over the weekly staff meeting to having me retell the story of that weekend. Then I was like: if any of this gets out I will never get this job!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Hey, did you know that too much sex makes your hair grow?\u2019; a high school comic strip stored at Paisley Park. Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate\n\nOver the next few weeks, Piepenbring and Prince went to concerts, parties and a private screening of Kung Fu Panda 3 together. They had conversations over the phone and in Prince\u2019s black Lincoln MKT (his driving, particularly his turn signalling, was excellent). The singer mentioned how at high school he\u2019d punched a kid who\u2019d thrown a racial slur at him \u2013 and that his best friend growing up was Jewish. He spoke about the death of an early love \u2013 the singer Vanity. \u201cHe had a great, deadpan and warm sense of humour. I was surprised by his autonomy and his ability to put people around him, including me, at ease.\u201d\n\nThe writer flew to Australia where Prince, who was checking into hotels under the name Peter Bravestrong, discussed with him his ideas for the book. \u201cIs it about the music industry? His parents? A handbook for the black community? His ideas could change in the course of a single conversation. I don\u2019t know which one he would have settled on,\u201d he says.\n\nA degree of trust had been established \u2013 Prince referred to Piepenbring as \u201cmy brother Dan\u201d \u2013 and the singer talked of having the pair\u2019s distinct voices merge over the course of the narrative. Thinking back to the epilepsy he suffered as a child, Prince suggested, \u201cWe could use seizures as a way of blending our voices. Blackouts.\u201d I tell Piepenbring this sounds more like avant-garde fiction than a traditional rock memoir. \u201cWhich I was so looking forward to! The fact that he wanted to produce something so formalist and postmodern and strange was the most surprising thing. Especially because, at this point in his career, he was writing songs in various generic modes rather than, as he did in the 1980s, shattering those modes. But what a burden! There\u2019s no guarantee it would have been readable, or necessarily true to what he had imagined.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of a series of shots Prince took in the bathroom mirror of a rented house in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, 1978. Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate\n\nOn 21 April, barely three months after they had started collaborating, Prince\u2019s death was announced; he had overdosed on fentanyl. The last time the two men had spoken was four days earlier, when Prince had phoned, talked a lot about his parents\u2019 influence on his life, ending: \u201cI just wanted to call and let you know that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking about. And I\u2019m OK.\u201d Was he lying? Was he, in fact, in great pain? \u201cMy thinking on this changes hour to hour. There were moments when I was certain he must have known, because to do those stripped-down Piano & A Microphone shows, and to pair that with an autobiography seems so summative. It\u2019s rooted in a past that for the longest time he would have eschewed. Prince may have known he was in poor health, but there\u2019s a difference between that and knowing he was dying.\u201d\n\nFor someone who said he didn\u2019t like to dwell on the past, it seems like he was hanging on to everything\n\nHis death seemed to spell the end for The Beautiful Ones (named after a song on the Purple Rain album), whose imminent publication had delighted fans. \u201cAfter he died, I was a mess,\u201d Piepenbring says. \u201cI was cranky, depressed. And I also felt a fool for feeling depressed: I didn\u2019t really even know this guy that well. But often I felt hurt and deprived and confused and angry at myself. And sometimes even at him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A page from a photo album Prince put together when he was 19 and recording his debut album, For You, in California. These shots were taken by his manager, Owen Husney, in July 1977. Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate\n\nPrince died without making a will and in the months following his death his estate was run from the courts, with advisers coming and going, claims from various family members, constant threats of litigation. \u201cA book wasn\u2019t on the top of anyone\u2019s mind,\u201d says Piepenbring. \u201cThey needed to bring in a lot of income, and quickly. They were probably thinking: which album can we release? What\u2019s in the vaults?\u201d Yet he couldn\u2019t forget his time at Paisley Park, the exchanges and intimacies he\u2019d shared, and started to think of resurrecting the book, now partially reconceptualised as one with \u201ca negative space at its centre, around whose mystery I orbit.\u201d\n\nWith his editor and publisher, Piepenbring gained access to the fabled vaults at Paisley Park. Prince fans, aware of how much music their hero withheld from the world, tend to regard this archive much as Howard Carter must have dreamed of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb. \u201cWe were struck by the sheer breadth and volume of it,\u201d Piepenbring says. \u201cFor someone who spent much of his career saying he didn\u2019t like to dwell on the past, it seems like he was hanging on to everything \u2013 wedding programmes, wedding gifts, a set of his-and-hers bowling balls (the latter engraved with the Prince squiggle and the name of his wife, Mayte).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest By late high school, Prince wrote, he had bought a \u2018vanilla stratocaster identical 2 the one Jimi played at Woodstock\u2019. Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate\n\n\u201cThe sheer quantity of paper was surprising. There was no real method to the madness. In one room you\u2019d find something from 1979, and within arm\u2019s reach there\u2019d be something from 2002. There\u2019d be these moments of intense intentionality \u2013 he\u2019d gathered up all his handwritten lyrics from across his career, clipped them together, and kept them in one place. Or he\u2019d gathered artefacts pertaining to his father\u2019s jazz band. It seemed very ad hoc and very personal.\u201d\n\nThe estate, which is currently run from the Carver County courts in Minnesota, limited access to the physical vault, pre-curating the material by digitising sections of the archive, which were uploaded on to a dedicated site from which Piepenbring selected material. So he hasn\u2019t seen everything. \u201cIt\u2019s Rumsfeldian,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere are known unknowns, and there are unknown unknowns.\u201d Still, responding to some of the words Prince repeatedly came back to during their conversations (freedom, creativity, community) he has fashioned a riveting anthology that includes many unseen photographs of Prince as a teenager, handwritten lyrics, and photographic contact sheets that illuminate the creative guile the singer put into finessing the persona that shocked and seduced the general public.\n\nThey keep trying to ram Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran down our throats, and we don\u2019t like it,\" Prince wrote\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of staged photoshoots of Prince,\u201d Piepenbring observes. \u201cI wanted things that gave me the same frisson as when we met. I could hardly believe I was seeing a mirror selfie of Prince. And that he went on taking them through his life \u2013 almost as a way of checking in on himself. I also love that photo of him with a guitar: it\u2019s the two objects that most readily come to mind when you think of Prince \u2013 guitar and bed \u2013 in a perfect combination of virtuosity and intimacy. He\u2019s got this very intense but abstract and insouciant look on his face. He seems almost lost in thought, and there\u2019s a bit of melancholy in there, too. It\u2019s such a lovely image.\u201d Asked why he has included so few photos from after 1986 in the book, Piepenbring argues not that Prince was too busy to maintain his archive but that, by then, \u201cPrince is in such professional hands that the choreography is complete.\u201d\n\nThe book contains cartoons by Prince (he called them \u201cPrince\u2019s Funnies\u201d), details of his first kiss, memories of watching R-rated movies at the local drive-in, and disses of the media conglomerates who control contemporary US music (\u201cWe need to tell them that they keep trying to ram Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran down our throats and we don\u2019t like it no matter how many times they play it\u201d). Of his mother, he recalls, \u201cShe would spend up what little $ the family had 4 survival on partying with her friends, then trespass in2 my bedroom, \u2018borrow\u2019 my personal $ that N\u2019d gotten from babysitting local kids, & then chastise me 4 even questioning her regarding the broken promise she made 2 pay me back.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Outtakes from the cover shoot for Parade, released in 1986. When Prince renewed his passport a few months later, he cropped a headshot from one of photographer Jeff Katz\u2019s images. Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate\n\nHis self-possession seems always to have been there: \u201cKids & teachers would tease me about My name but it never bothered Me because it was unique. No One Else had the given name Prince.\u201d He developed his performance philosophy early, too: \u201cA vibrant imagination is where the best songs R found. Make-believe characters wearing make-believe clothes all 2gether creating memories & calling it Life.\u201d\n\nOne of the most revealing features of the book is its reproductions of Prince\u2019s handwriting. \u201cIt was the perfect physical emblem of this tension in his life,\u201d says Piepenbring. \u201cThe beautiful, finely wrought scripting is also pouring out of him so quickly that it borders on illegibility. On the one hand, discipline; on the other, free-spiritedness.\u201d Why, I ask, did he insist on using the letter \u2018N\u2019 for \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018U\u2019 for You\u2019? \u201cI would have wanted to ask him about glyphs. Was it disorientation? A private language? Something more playful? He was fascinated with codes and told me of feeling that his childhood home was encoded: he would look at the wallpaper and certain objects and feel there was a message in them.\u201d\n\nThis year, limited-edition and previously unreleased Prince recordings are starting to be issued; his catalogue has been made available for streaming. But Piepenbring finds it hard to visit Paisley Park itself. \u201cThe museum there is a wonderful experience, but you can feel that something has gone. There\u2019s nothing that compares with Prince being there when he was alive. There used to be a sense of a flame being guarded.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In bed on France Avenue, Edina, Minnesota, April 1978. Prince\u2019s first home, it was bought with a Warner Bros advance, and became the site of his first DIY basement studio. Photograph: Copyright The Prince Estate\n\nThe book is not the one Piepenbring envisaged. Our conversation is full of sighs and absences, spectres and conjectures; Prince, so cryptic in his lifetime, remains elusive. How does his ghostwriter feel now, looking back on those intense three months?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had dreams about Prince, where he\u2019s still alive and his death was just a widely misreported thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m still reluctant to handle those memories. They\u2019re almost like something in a vitrine: the more you look, the more you get hot breath and fingerprints on the glass. Suddenly this very pure thing is smudged and you can never see it as clearly again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Beautiful Ones by Prince is published by Cornerstone, at \u00a325.
