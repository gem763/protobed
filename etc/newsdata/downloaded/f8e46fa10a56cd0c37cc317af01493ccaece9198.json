(Submitted by Ashley McClair-Thomas)\n\nFalaise\u2019s workshop is held monthly for girls with curly hair in Montreal.\n\nIt helps them learn to embrace their natural hair texture by teaching them the right technique.\n\n\u201cI just feel so much more confident rocking my curls,\u201d Ashley said following her experience at the workshop.\n\nThe story behind Falaise\u2019s workshop has been turned into a documentary by Canesugar Filmworks and is streaming on CBC Gem.\n\nAshley\u2019s story is not unique\n\nBlack women have struggled for decades to find ways to embrace their natural hair, said A\u2019lelia Bundles, a black author and journalist.\n\nThat\u2019s because \u201cwe live in a culture where European beauty standards are dominant,\u201d she said.\n\nBundles wrote a book about C.J. Walker, her great-great grandmother, who started one of the first lines of beauty products for curly hair more than one hundred years ago.\n\n\u201cNot only is our skin colour different (...) but our hair texture is different,\u201d said Bundles, from her office in Washington, D.C.\n\nA\u2019lelia Bundles has worn her hair in different styles over the years, including an afro in the 1960\u2019s. Her great-great-grandmother was one of the first people to develop products specifically for women with curly hair. (Larry French/Getty Images)\n\nShe herself has observed discrimination in the U.S. against black kids because of their curly hair.\n\n\u201cThere are schools that have rules against afro puffs,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say it\u2019s distracting. But nobody is saying that about a little girl who has ponytails.\u201d\n\nAs a result, some black women and girls feel pressured to straighten their hair or wear it pulled back, rather than leave it loose and curly.\n\nAshley\u2019s journey\n\nIn Ashley\u2019s case, she said she often felt insecure about her hair before attending the workshop, and always wore it slicked back in a bun.\n\n\u201cI would try to blend in with kids who didn't have curly hair. I didn't want to like, make a big scene,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI felt like having like big, big hair was scary or that it was just ugly. I never liked it, I always liked straight hair, perfectly cut and everything.\u201d\n\nAshley said she wanted to attend the workshop to learn how to love her hair \u201cand be grateful and proud of having my hair and my natural curls.\u201d\n\nAshley recently attended a workshop where she learned how to care for her curls. (Nancy\u2019s Workshop/Canesugar Filmworks)\n\nOver the course of an afternoon at Falaise\u2019s Montreal salon, girls learned how to wash, detangle and style their hair.\n\nAshley said helping other girls with their hair \u2014 and having them help her \u2014 was \u201creally special.\u201d\n\nHaving done the workshop, Ashley said she sees her \u2018do in a different light.\n\n\u201cMy hair feels healthy, my hair feels beautiful. I feel amazing.\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s paying those lessons forward, by teaching her 11-year-old sister Hailey how to style her curly hair.\n\nAshley is helping her 11-year-old sister Hailey learn to love her hair. (Submitted by Ashley McClair-Thomas)\n\nHailey said she used to look at celebrities and wish her hair was straight like theirs, thinking that it would be easier to manage.\n\nWith Ashley\u2019s help, though, Hailey is starting to love her hair.\n\n\u201cI think it looks really good, and I really think that I could go out in public like this and be really confident,\u201d she said.\n\nAshley said her hair transformation has also inspired her friends with curly hair to try different styles.\n\nShe hopes that even more kids will feel inspired by her experience to embrace their natural hair.\n\n\u201cThey should feel encouraged to help each other with their curly hair and talk about the struggles, talk about the things they like and just make it a topic.\u201d", "description": "A teen from Montreal has learned to embrace her curly hair thanks to a workshop that teaches girls the best techniques for curly hair.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/ASHLEY_and_HALEY_thumbnail_V2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
