You Picked a Real Winner", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cFirst in his class at West Point and he ends up polishing Trump\u2019s boots,\u201d added Phyliss Dalmatian.\n\nStill, the results weren\u2019t even close. Besides his dedication to protecting the president from, um, criminal justice, Barr unnerved readers with his war against secularism. \u201cThe chief enforcer of the Constitution recently gave a speech decrying those who would interfere with Christian religious control of our government,\u201d noted Sharon from Montana, who predicted Barr \u201cwill go down in history as the worst attorney general.\u201d\n\nMaybe it was partly the name. So many possible Barr rhymes.\n\n\u201cThe new star \u2014 By far \u2014 Is Billy Barr,\u201d announced Stephen Glynn. \u201cWhere\u2019s the tar and feathers?\u201d\n\nWe can skip tar and feathers. Our goal is not physical torture. Just humiliation.\n\nAs usual, we got a lot of complaints about the Worst Cabinet Member contest from people who said it was impossible to pick just one. (\u201cThere is a dead heat with all of them tied at the bottom.\u201d)\n\nNobody, however, claimed there was a problem of shortage of possibilities.\n\nPerpetual contender Betsy DeVos finished third. Readers pointed out that the secretary of education was recently held in contempt of court for refusing to support students victimized by crooked for-profit schools. But the bottom line was that Donald Trump\u2019s top education official doesn\u2019t like public schools. End of story.\n\nOn the plus side, DeVos has always gotten a bit of a slide from those who argue she\u2019s too incompetent to be a major threat. There are several cabineteers in that category. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that Ben Carson must be in the Witness Protection Program,\u201d wrote a voter from Nashua, N.H., about our secretary of housing and urban development. \u201cReally, has anyone seen him in the last several months?\u201d", "description": "The vote wasn\u2019t even close.", "authors": ["Gail Collins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/opinion/30collins-1/30collins-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
