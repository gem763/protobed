A further \u00a33m is being provided by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.\n\nTowns and cities had to bid for the \u00a395m funding, which was first announced in May.\n\nThe announcement comes after figures showed that about 16 shops a day closed in the first half of the year as retailers restructure their businesses and more shopping moves online.\n\nLisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC which was behind the research, said retailers had to invest more in making stores \"relevant to today's consumers\", but added that \"new and different types of operators\" needed encouragement to fill vacant space.\n\n'Wider regeneration'\n\nThe government said the money would \"support wider regeneration\" in the 69 successful areas by attracting future commercial investment.\n\n\"Our nation's heritage is one of our great calling cards to the world, attracting millions of visitors to beautiful historic buildings that sit at the heart of our communities,\" said Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan.\n\n\"It is right that we ensure these buildings are preserved for future generations but it is important that we make them work for the modern world.\"\n\nOther major projects include a \u00a32m drive to restore historic shop-fronts in London's Tottenham area, which suffered extensive damage in the 2011 riots.\n\nBy region, the funding breaks down as follows:\n\nLondon and the South East: \u00a314.3m\n\nSouth West: \u00a313.7m\n\nMidlands: \u00a321.1m\n\nNorth East and Yorkshire: \u00a317.2m\n\nNorth West: \u00a318.7m\n\nYou can read a full list of the towns and cities that will benefit here.\n\n\"Increasing competition from online outlets is putting High Streets across the country under growing pressure,\" said the DCMS.\n\n\"As part of the government's drive to help High Streets adapt to changing consumer habits, the \u00a395m funding will provide a welcome boost.\"\n\nResponding to the move, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said High Streets had been \"decimated\" by \"a decade of Tory austerity\".\n\nHe added: \"This funding pales in comparison to the \u00a31bn Cultural Capital fund that Labour is committed to, which will boost investment in culture, arts and heritage right across the country, not just a few lucky areas.\"", "description": "The government lists 69 English towns and cities that will benefit from regeneration money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A492/production/_108803124_photo1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
