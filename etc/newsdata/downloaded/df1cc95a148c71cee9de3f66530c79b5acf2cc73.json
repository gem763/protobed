They were badly beaten in the midterms and have all but given up on taking the House from Speaker Pelosi this cycle.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis election cycle, though, there are some questions that should be put to every Republican candidate.\n\nDo you support Sen. Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMurkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution Senate rejects Paul effort to cut spending Overnight Defense: Latest on al-Baghdadi's death | Trump weighs releasing raid video | Pentagon reveals 2 suspects captured in raid | House to vote on impeachment procedures | Border wall fight stalls defense bill MORE as Senate majority leader?\n\nFirst, \u201cDo you support Sen. Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader?\u201d\n\nMoscow Mitch enabled Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, refuses to secure future elections against foreign manipulation, displays unmatched hypocrisy, opposes Americans exercising their right to vote (if they aren\u2019t voting for him), and has used the filibuster to block more legislation with majority support than any senator in history.\n\nThat\u2019s only a small part of why Moscow Mitch is the most widely disliked politician in the country.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 more Americans disapprove of Mitch McConnell than of President Trump Donald John TrumpJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry READ: Army officer to tell investigators he twice reported concerns over Trump's Ukraine dealings Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution MORE. On average, about 55 percent disapprove of the president\u2019s performance, while a slightly higher 57 percent disapprove of McConnell\u2019s.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Kentucky senator also holds onto fewer supporters than Trump \u2014 41 percent approve of Trump, but only 24 percent approve of McConnell.\n\nWhile Trump and McConnell work to make Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Automakers group sides with Trump in emissions lawsuit | Latest on California wildfires | Walden won't seek reelection | Park Service scraps plan to charge protesters for security Hillicon Valley: FCC chief aims to ban Huawei, ZTE from federal program | DOJ to allow body cameras in joint task forces | Facebook workers push back over political ads Trump Jr. sending copies of 'Triggered' book to Romney, top Democrats MORE (D-N.Y.) the face of the Democratic Party, they forget that, while she\u2019s not popular, more Americans dislike them than dislike her.\n\nUsually politicians can take some comfort from the people back home who know them best. Not so, McConnell.\n\nAccording to Morning Consult polling, no senator is more widely disliked by their constituents than Mitch McConnell. Just 37 percent of Kentuckians approve of his performance, while 50 percent disapprove.\n\nSo, ask every Republican candidate, \u201cDo you support Sen. Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader?\u201d\n\nShould politicians be permitted to ask foreign governments to help them in their campaigns?\n\nHere\u2019s a second question all GOPers should be asked: \u201cShould politicians be permitted to ask foreign governments to help them in their campaigns?\u201d\n\nTrump has made it clear he thinks it is perfectly proper to solicit foreign assistance.\n\nVice President Pence, along with Sens.

They\u2019re being asked, irrespective of the impeachment inquiry, in principle, if it is appropriate for U.S. politicians to ask foreign governments to help them win elections.\n\nAre the GOP question dodgers really suggesting that their view on whether seeking foreign interference is right or wrong depends upon whether the president did it?\n\nVoters are clear on the answer, even if Republican politicians are not.\n\nSixty-six percent told Quinnipiac pollsters it \u201cis not acceptable \u2026 for the president of the United States to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival.\u201d Just 24 percent said it was acceptable.\n\nWhy can\u2019t Republican politicians answer a question about fundamental principles that\u2019s so easy for the public to answer?\n\nDo you think President Trump upholds adequate standards for ethics in government?\n\nHere\u2019s one more that hasn\u2019t been asked of many GOPers, but should be: \u201cDo you think President Trump upholds adequate standards for ethics in government?\u201d\n\nThat too is different from asking whether he should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nOnly 36 percent of Americans think Trump upholds adequate ethical standards, while 60 percent think he does not.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWouldn\u2019t you like to know how Republican candidates for Senate and Congress would answer these questions?\n\nDon\u2019t you deserve some answers?\n\nInsist on them.\n\nMellman is president of The Mellman Group and has helped elect 30 U.S. senators, 12 governors and dozens of House members.
