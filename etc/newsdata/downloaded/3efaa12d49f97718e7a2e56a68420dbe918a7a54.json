It\u2019s history. A new HBO documentary that debuts on the event\u2019s 18th anniversary treats it that way.\n\nThe necessity of her project, \u201cWhat Happened on September 11,\u201d struck filmmaker Amy Schatz when a third grade girl told her about a playdate where she and a friend Googled \u201cSept. 11 attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a child does that, what he or she finds are some pretty horrific images that are not necessarily appropriate for kids,\u201d Schatz said on Tuesday. \u201cSo I felt a responsibility to try to fill that void and try to give kids something that isn\u2019t horrifying and kind of fills in the gap.\u201d\n\nThe half-hour film debuts Wednesday at 6 p.m. A companion piece, focusing on the memories of former students at a high school near Ground Zero, premieres three hours later.\n\nSchatz has made a specialty of creating films that seek to explain the inexplicable, with \u201cThe Number on Great-Grandpa\u2019s Arm\u201d tackling the Holocaust and another on the Parkland shooting. \u201cI\u2019m really desperate for some more lightness very soon,\u201d she said.\n\nIn this case, she worked with the Sept. 11 remembrance museum on the story, filming two men who work there giving presentations to third graders. Stephen Kern, who worked on the 62nd floor of the World Trade Center\u2019s North Tower, talks about being evacuated. Matthew Crawford, whose father was a firefighter who died that day, discusses his experience. She also found a middle school in Secaucus, New Jersey, that teaches history through art and poetry, helping students process the emotions of what they learned.\n\nShort history lessons are sprinkled throughout the film, about New York and the World Trade Center, the one-time tallest towers in the world. Construction began in 1968.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest questions the kids have is \u2018why? \u2018Why would somebody do that? Why would there be such cruelty?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very difficult thing to grapple with and answer so that was the trickiest part of the project.\u201d\n\nThe film tells of Osama bin Laden and his activism that started with the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. But it never truly answers the whys. Maybe no one can.\n\nSchatz doesn\u2019t avoid some of the terrible images of the day: the second plane striking the World Trade Center and resultant fireball, the collapse of each tower and the giant clouds of debris that billowed through the canyons of city streets. Schatz didn\u2019t want to avoid those clips, since kids know that planes crashed into the buildings, but she opted not to spend much time on them \u201cso that we didn\u2019t create too many lingering after-images in people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nAs part of her research, Schatz interviewed alumni of Stuyvesant High School near the World Trade Center site. But the memories of what they saw, heard and smelled that day - and the uncertainty of how they would get home from school - proved too raw. That\u2019s why \u201cIn the Shadow of the Towers: Stuyvesant High on 9/11\u201d is a separate film that premieres on HBO three hours after the first one.\n\nSchatz said a school curriculum is being developed for teaching children about the tragedy, and \u201cWhat Happened on September 11\u201d will be made available to schools for free. The film is aimed generally at children ages 7 to 12.\n\nThroughout her work, Schatz kept returning to the memory of the youngster searching for details about Sept. 11 on the internet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t protect kids from what they\u2019re going to come across,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed to me there was an opportunity to put something out there that is age-appropriate and not too scary and give them the tools they need to understand the world around them.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For students from elementary to high school, the Sept. 11 terrorist attack isn't a memory.
