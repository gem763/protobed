Watch Your White Sons.", "language": "en", "text": "So what can parents do? First, we need to understand how this works.\n\nA favorite activity for many boys is to watch gamers playing video games on YouTube. According to John Duffy, author of \u201cParenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety,\u201d the problems come with advertisements that may appear during the videos. Kids can be exposed to dozens of ads in a sitting. They might hear about the border, or \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d or a conspiracy theory on how the left works, Dr. Duffy said. Many of these spots are created and promoted by organizations like PragerU, which, Dr. Duffy notes, is not an accredited university but a propaganda machine that introduces viewers to extremist views via video. And YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm offers videos that become more and more extreme as viewers watch them.\n\n\u201cThere is a sophisticated psychology at play,\u201d Dr. Duffy warns, noting that today\u2019s teenagers have been using smartphones and tablets their whole lives. They like to dive deeper into topics that pique their curiosity, which is a great thing. The problem is they often turn to the in ternet before their parents for answers. Recommended videos and comments left on YouTube can lead them to threads full of racism and conspiracy theories on forums like 4chan . Google may lead them to white nationalist outlets like The Daily Stormer, where hate and harassment are normalized. Often, they have no idea which sources are reputable.\n\nThey may also find videos by more mainstream figures, including members of the so-called intellectual dark web like Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto, whose conservative perspectives on feminism and gender are very popular among young men and often are a path to more extreme content and ideologies.\n\nIn an interview with the actor Alan Alda for the podcast \u201cClear+Vivid,\u201d Christian Picciolini, a former Nazi, explains that modern white supremacists create friendships and build trust in online spaces such as autism chat rooms and gaming-related forums. They \u201cgo to these places and they promise them paradise,\u201d he says.\n\nInevitably, kids who have encountered these messages will mimic extremist talking points, and those of us who find these views repulsive may be tempted to yell at them, ground them or take away their devices in a futile attempt to keep them away from this propaganda.\n\nThe problem is, punitive responses often create a sense of shame that can feed a growing sense of anger \u2014 an anger the alt-right is eager to exploit.\n\nWhat really hooks many white teenagers is the alt-right\u2019s insistence that white men are under attack in America, the true victims of oppression. If your child has already been punished for his opinions, this message is especially resonant. They find a home for their rage, a brotherhood of guys like them, and that oh-so-alluring heroic struggle \u2014 and that\u2019s how an extremist is born.", "description": "Parents need to understand how white supremacists prey on teen boys, so they can intervene.", "authors": ["Joanna Schroeder"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/sunday/13schroeder-sub/13schroeder-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
