He is tied 18th in the elite 78-player field at seven-under par after a 71 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more people I can hang out with who are my age,\u201d said Niemann about his life on the globetrotting Tour.\n\n\u201cSo makes it a lot more fun and interesting, and also because they\u2019re really good players.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Cool to be part of history\u2019 \u2013\n\nNorway\u2019s Hovland, 22, has this week set a PGA Tour record for most consecutive rounds in the sixties and earlier this year broke Jack Nicklaus\u2019s record for the lowest score by an amateur at the US Open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to kind of be a part of history,\u201d said the Norwegian after the 19-round streak ended with a 74 on Saturday to leave him tied 33rd at four-under par.\n\n\u201cBottom line is I just try to shoot as low as I can and try to win a golf tournament.\u201d\n\nIm, the first Asian to be named US PGA Tour Rookie of the Year, has been a darling of the Korean media at the CJ Cup, which is being played on his home course at Nine Bridges on Jeju Island.\n\nHe goes into Sunday at five-under par in a share of 26th place after a third-round 70.\n\nStill only 21, he had seven top-10s and was the only rookie to qualify in the 30-man field for the season-long FedEx Cup finale, the Tour Championship.\n\nIm was presented with the 2019 Rookie of the Year award before play got under way this week.\n\n\u201cI went to a practice range and many people recognised me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is different from last year. Now when I go to a golf course people recognise me.\u201d\n\nAll are wildly talented, and all have a fearlessness that come with youth. It remains to be seen if any will go on to win majors.\n\nBut if Morikawa\u2019s determination is anything to go by, that could well come sooner rather than later for some of them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very fortunate but you know, we were ready to come out here and win,\u201d said Morikawa.\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve done it, Matthew\u2019s done it, Sung-jae\u2019s right there, Viktor\u2019s right there so it\u2019s gonna be really fun, especially when we know we\u2019re able to play with each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d", "description": "Jeju (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Collin Morikawa showed why he is one of the leading lights of a new generation of golf stars when he shot a stunning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/babdaa_collin-morikawa-us-hits-his-tee-shot-on-hole-cj-cup-bridges-golf-club-in-jeju-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
