(\u201cVaxil\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX VENTURE: VXL), an innovative immunotherapy biotech focused on cancer and infectious diseases, is pleased to announce that the closing date for the previously announced non-brokered private placement of up to 18,750,000 common shares at a price of CDN$0.04 per share for gross proceeds of up to CDN$750,000 (the \u201cOffering\u201d) has been extended and is expected to close on or about November 15, 2019. Proceeds of the Offering are intended to be used to advance the two programs (i.e., ImMucinTM and newly licensed P-ESPB) including formulation, in vitro screening, efficacy testing and IP (e.g., patent). The extension is to allow for certain new investors to complete their due diligence procedures.\n\nThe Offering is directed to all existing shareholders (including directors, officers and other insiders of the Company) as well as other Canadian and international investors. Closing of the Offering, which is at the discretion of the Company is subject to certain conditions including receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\n\nABOUT VAXIL\n\nVaxil is an Israeli immunotherapy biotech company focused on its novel approach to targeting prominent cancer markers and infectious diseases. Its lead product ImMucin\u2122 successfully completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma and received orphan drug status from the FDA and EMA. The company continues to develop ImMucintm and is also developing a tuberculosis vaccine / treatment that has demonstrated promising preliminary results with further preclinical evaluation underway at a top US academic and research institution. Additional indications and mAb candidates are under evaluation as immuno-oncology and infectious disease treatments alone and in combination with other treatments.\n\nVaxil exploits the unique properties of signal peptide domains on crucial proteins to develop targeted therapies against cancer targets and infectious disease pathogens. These signal peptide domains are identified by VaxHit\u2122, Vaxil\u2019s proprietary bioinformatic approach. These SPs induce a robust T- and B-cell response across wide and varied HLA subtypes, while acting as true, universal neoantigens. The peptide platform targets these cells by \u201ceducating\u201d or specifically activating the immune system to recognize and attack the affected cells. In addition, Vaxil\u2019s mAb platform directly recognizes the target protein expressed on malignant cells and recruits other elements of the immune system to lyse those cells.\n\nDisclaimer: The TSX Venture Exchange Inc. has in no way passed upon the merits of the Company has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this press release.
