Several other players were later accused of wrongdoing by Spanish tax authorities, including former Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nMessi says he wished Ronaldo would have stayed at Real Madrid because his presence was good for the Spanish league and the rivalry with Barcelona.\n\nIn Monday's interview, Messi also reiterated his wish to have Neymar back with the club, and that when former teammate Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez decides to coach Barcelona the team will play similarly to how it did under Pep Guardiola.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
