More than half of the seats were reserved for guests and allies of the administration, including many black supporters of Mr. Trump who came from out of state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy he was here,\u201d said Byron Donalds, a black Republican lawmaker in the Florida Legislature who came here for the speech. \u201cPeople say a lot of things, but I\u2019m about what actually gets done. Some people take issue with him, but I\u2019ve always said, don\u2019t talk about it \u2014 be about it. And I\u2019m about what he\u2019s getting done.\u201d\n\nThe friendliness of the audience was clear from the moment Mr. Trump took the stage, when someone shouted, \u201cWe love you, Mr. President, we love you!\u201d More than once, the audience broke into chants of \u201cfour more years,\u201d to which Mr. Trump responded at one point: \u201cJust don\u2019t say 16 more years. You\u2019ll drive them crazy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s speech opened a three-day event at the college, billed as the \u201cSecond Step Presidential Justice Forum.\u201d Leading Democratic presidential candidates will attend the forum on Saturday and Sunday to discuss their criminal justice plans, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nThe forum\u2019s name is a reference to the First Step Act, which has helped thousands of federal inmates secure early release under new sentencing guidelines.\n\nOverhauling the criminal justice system has, in recent years, been one of the rare areas of bipartisan agreement in an increasingly polarized Congress, and that consensus has spilled into the presidential race. Democrats making the progressive argument for reform have cited the system\u2019s disproportionate impact on black, Latino and Native American communities.", "description": "President Trump, speaking at Benedict College in South Carolina, said he had done more for black voters than any other president.", "authors": ["Astead W.
