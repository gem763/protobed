Opioid addiction can be treated with the medications buprenophine or methadone, and opioid overdoses can be reversed with the drug naloxone. There's no FDA-approved medication for methamphetamine treatment, nor any overdose reversal drug to revive people, Dezman explained. Developing such a treatment is a top research priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, he added.\n\nPHOTO: Packets of fentanyl and methamphetamine, which U.S. Customs and Border Protection say they seized from a truck crossing into Arizona from Mexico, is on display during a news conference at the Port of Nogales, Ariz., Jan. 31, 2019.

The potent opioid, the most frequently cited substance in drug overdose deaths, was involved in 39% of those cases in 2017.\n\n\"Clearly, fentanyl continues to be a problem,\" Hedegaard said.\n\n(MORE: 'Crisis': Surge in cocaine mixed with fentanyl has communities and law enforcement on edge)\n\nIn comparison, nationwide, heroin was involved in 23% of overdose deaths, cocaine was involved in 21% and methamphetamines were involved in 13%.\n\nThe nation's drug overdose death rate has more than tripled since 1999, with 70,000 cases in 2017, according to the CDC.", "description": "Although fentanyl use remain a pressing concern in the United States, a government report that details regional differences in drug overdose deaths shows that in much of the country, methamphetamine is a bigger killer.
