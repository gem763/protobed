Bone-eating worms and scavenging eelpouts were devouring the remains, while octopuses and crabs explored the skeleton.\n\nYou can watch a video of the eating \"bonanza\" \u2014 as one of the marine researchers put it \u2014 on YouTube or on the research vessel's livestream site.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nMore than 4,000 feet under the waves of Monterey Bay, California, sits an underwater volcanic peak called Davidson Seamount.\n\nDuring an exploratory dive of this habitat on October 16, marine researchers stumbled upon a 16-foot-long whale carcass.\n\nThe scientists used a pair of unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to capture footage of the skeleton and the deep-sea denizens feasting on the creature's remains.\n\nWhale carcasses that sink to the bottom of the ocean like this are called \"whale falls.\" They become new habitats because the cetacean's decomposing body provides food and shelter for myriad marine species. In the case of this whale fall, which the researchers determined was a baleen whale, the ROVs' cameras saw octopuses, eelpout (eellike skinny fish), and bone-eating worms sharing in the feast.\n\nHere's the video of this undersea \"bonanza,\" as one of the researchers put it:\n\nThe research team behind the footage is from the exploratory vessel Nautilus and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Nautilus is under the direction of Robert Ballard, who is best known for finding the wreck of the Titanic.\n\nRead more: The Titanic is slowly but surely disappearing \u2014 here's what the wreck looks like now\n\nThe Exploration Vessel Nautilus is a 210-foot-long research vessel owned by the Ocean Exploration Trust.

Poulton/EV Nautilus/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe vessel boasts two ROVs, named Argus and Hercules, which are equipped to explore dark waters thousands of feet deep.\n\nThe group had originally been looking for brooding female octopuses on the flanks of the seamount. But on this dive \u2014 which happened to be the last of the season \u2014 the crew discovered far more than they bargained for.\n\nAn overhead shot of the almost 16-foot-long whale carcass.

Countless scavenging eelpout and at least 15 octopuses glided in and out of the white ribs. Blankets of pinkish-red worms covered the vertebrae and tail bones.\n\nRed-looking fuzz on the whale's tail are bone-eating Osedax worms that devour fat from the skeleton. Screenshot from the Nautilus EV Live Stream\n\nOne of the scientists can be heard on the livestream identifying the worms as belonging to the genus Osadex, which is Latin for \"bone-eating.\" These snot-flower worms, also known as \"zombie worms,\" burrow into bones in order to suck out the fat and oil inside.\n\n\"Dinner is served,\" one researcher said.\n\nMarine researchers discovered deep-sea octopuses, right, and eelpouts, center and left, exploring the whale carcass.
