For the polyglot set of professionals, academics, creatives, and diplomats, invitations for their children were common \u2014 one of the perks of sending their kids to the U.N. school is having them attend things like a fireside chat with the Deputy Secretary-General. But this one was different.\n\nThird and fourth graders had been specially extended, wrote junior school principal Pascal Vallet, a \u201cunique opportunity.\u201d On Monday, September 23, ten lucky students would get \u201cto tour the Stock Exchange and participate in ringing the opening bell with the First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump.\u201d\n\nThe grapevine of parent cell phones and email addresses worked as urgently as a wartime wire service. \u201cWhen I saw the letter, my jaw dropped and I stood frozen for a minute,\u201d someone wrote. One mom told another mom, \u201cI\u2019m about to scream.\u201d There was talk of picket signs at pick-up.\n\nTuition for a four-year-old at the United Nations International School, or UNIS, costs $38,600. But for many parents, the Manhattan campus, jutting out into the East River a mile south of U.N. headquarters, is a kind of it\u2019s-a-small-world-after-all humanitarian utopia. Especially for those at the junior \u2014 or elementary \u2014 school. \u201cYou\u2019re actually sort of shunned if you\u2019re a hedge-funder,\u201d claims one. The children of U.N. employees, who attend with the support of U.N. subsidies mingle with those of non-U.N. parents who pay full tuition. Students solve conflicts around classroom \u201cPeace Tables\u201d (there is a Peace Bench in the playground). They were treated by grief counselors after the election of Donald Trump. There are \u201ctrans kids, mixed-race kids,\u201d one mother told me. \u201cIt\u2019s our little safe haven. And this administration has attacked this haven and everything it stands for.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that the ten children would accompany FLOTUS only on a volunteer basis, chosen at random from those whose parents signed them up. Melania\u2019s confusing \u201cBe Best\u201d anti-bullying cause hasn\u2019t exactly taken off, and she wanted, as one father put it, \u201cthe imprimatur\u201d of the U.N. She wanted \u201cthe sweet faces of \u2018diverse\u2019 UNIS\u201d kids, wrote someone else, lined up behind her like the side of a UNICEF box. Though Nikki Haley\u2019s children had gone to UNIS during her tenure as U.N. Ambassador, she had never caused a media scene, a parent told me \u2014 \u201cthough we always thought it was strange she sent her kids here, given her stance on the U.N.\u201d\n\nMelania was an incursion on an institution that had felt insulated from the indignities of the current administration. Trump Tower, 50 blocks away, might as well have been overseas. Parents began immediately sending impassioned condemnations to Vallet: \u201cInstead of enlisting some photogenic kids as UNIS PR props, might I suggest we offer to the U.S. Mission that they could invite some children from the cages in Mexicali?\u201d one woman wrote, cc\u2019ing the school\u2019s director.\n\nBy Tuesday night, though the White House had requested confidentiality, the story had leaked to the press. A \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d U.N. employee and parent had written to U.N. Undersecretary General Catherine Pollard. Vallet and the director, Dr. Dan Brenner, usually visible on campus, were supposedly \u201chiding.\u201d I got a text that said, \u201cWe\u2019re organizing.\u201d\n\nThe next day, UNIS leadership finally addressed the controversy in another email. Brenner let it be known that, despite the outrage, the event would occur as scheduled. He maintained that \u201cdebate and dialogue are fundamental\u201d to the U.N.\u2019s core mission; the school even planned to present the First Lady with a framed copy of the UNIS Mission Statement, which promises that students will become \u201can active force in shaping a better world.\u201d And he claimed that \u201cover 90 families\u201d from the third and fourth grades had volunteered. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe it,\u201d one mother said.\n\nIf diplomacy is what made UNIS a wonderful place for the parent intelligentsia, it was now getting in their way. Galvanizing people notorious for decorum was difficult, even if they hailed from countries the American president had insulted. No one was planning to speak out publicly. Part of their objection was that \u201cthe host country should not be partisan,\u201d one non-U.N. international parent explained, which made open dissent difficult. \u201cPeople who work at the U.N. are worried about their jobs.\u201d By Wednesday night, machinations of the outraged had the tenor of international espionage; even the most ardent insisted we speak over an encrypted messaging app.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of shit going on,\u201d said one parent. \u201cLots of paranoia.\u201d No one had yet heard from a single family who had signed up their child for propaganda. Some of the parents were focused on a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Had the amount, roughly half of the 3rd and 4th grade classes, been inflated? Who was the director trying to appease? Dr. Brenner did not return a request for confirmation on how the 90-plus number was calculated. Some people heard secondhand that so-and-so parents \u201cwere told they had to\u201d sign up.\n\nHad it all been timed with the week when the high schoolers would be away on a class-wide retreat, without their phones, unable to tweet and post Instagram stories with the hashtags parents had devised? (#Nomelania was one of them.) Whether it had or not, there were \u201cmachinations afoot.\u201d A fourth grader had started a petition, I heard. I was told urgently on Wednesday night to watch Rachel Maddow. But nothing happened.\n\nAs of now, the bell-ringing is still on, though according to an agitator \u201csome things are still in the works.\u201d The First Lady\u2019s spokesperson confirmed to CNN, in a story that did not mention the discord, \u201cMrs. Trump will be taking part in an iconic New York City tradition, and encouraging children to be best, through her initiative.\u201d\n\nOf course, despite his \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine, the Trump administration routinely works with the leadership of foreign governments in mutually beneficial arrangements. In that respect, 90-plus families isn\u2019t so hard to believe. For the betrayed, the conspiracy knows no bounds. Another email sent this week from the middle school principal, which had seemingly discouraged students from attending Friday\u2019s climate strike, was simply too sinister of a coincidence. The FLOTUS field trip, after all, was scheduled for the very same day as the UN\u2019s Climate Action Summit. \u201cThey are worried about antifa, or that they are being partisan? What the heck?\u201d a parent wrote. \u201cDid they get a big check from a GOP person or from the Koch Bros? It\u2019s all very dark.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
