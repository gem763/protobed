For your weekend reading, we've started in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top USA TODAY Opinion pieces. As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY Opinion editors\n\nBy Donald M. Berwick\n\n\"America desperately needs an honest health policy discussion. That\u2019s why it has been so disappointing over the past several weeks to watch multiple candidates parrot right-wing attacks on \"Medicare for All,\" like claiming that it will greatly increase spending on health care or ringing alarms about raising taxes on the middle class.\"\n\nBy Judy Sheindlin\n\n\"We need a no-nonsense president who\u2019s sane, competent and honest, someone who can\u2019t be bought and has no skin in the game. As he showed during 12 years as mayor in New York City Hall, Michael Bloomberg fits the bill. ... Most important, he\u2019s the only person out there who seems to understand that screaming at one another gets us nowhere.\"\n\nTrump the survivor (Photo: Kevin Siers/The Charlotte (North Carolina) Observer/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Chris Truax\n\n\"To grasp their final chance at redemption, congressional Republicans need not necessarily conclude that Trump must be impeached and removed from office. But they do need to stop considering their short-term political interests and start considering the country\u2019s long-term interests. Allowing a president to abuse his office for political and personal gain cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nBy Jimmy Gomez and Lisa Rosenberg\n\n\"California temporarily banned the use of facial-recognition technology in body cameras used by law enforcement \u2014 one of the first states to do so. ... Limited information about how it\u2019s being used by law enforcement, and a disturbing lack of transparency and accountability from the very companies that develop and sell it, mean we need to consider its dangers, including its proven racial and gender bias.\"\n\nIn plain view (Photo: Adam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy The Editorial Board\n\n\"Americans can read the witnesses' r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and their records of nonpartisan service and judge for themselves who is abusing their power. ... In the end, Americans will have been well served by the rank and file of government \u2014 from a whistleblower who saw something wrong and reported it, to current and former officials willing to testify about what they witnessed. It's the best pathway to truth and accountability.\"\n\nBy Noah Bookbinder\n\n\"The president should not get any credit for backing down. The selection of his property for a key international conference was an intolerable abuse. ... Bowing to the reality that this abuse would not be tolerated is hardly praiseworthy. You don\u2019t get credit for doing the right thing only after being shamed for doing the wrong thing.\"\n\nQuid pro quo (Photo: Steve Sack/The Minneapolis (Minnesota) Star-Tribune/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Joseph Geevarghese\n\n\"If we want to win back voters in Ohio and Michigan, we need to inspire them with a transformational vision of change, and not incrementalism that they\u2019ll again reject as inadequate in this moment of growing inequality. ... There is one presidential candidate who has shown up and stood up as a champion on all these issues. We believe that candidate is Bernie Sanders.'\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
