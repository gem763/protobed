And that\u2019s despite At Home pushing through a round of price increases to consumers and asking suppliers to absorb the latest crop of tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe have worked with our suppliers to migrate out of China, do direct sourcing and value-based engineering. The exchange rate has worked in our favor since we pay in dollars. We have raised prices. But we have been careful and surgical with that because we are the lowest price leader,\u201d At Home CEO Lee Bird said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nAt Home relies on China, India, Vietnam, Turkey and Hong Kong to source about 65% of its merchandise. The remainder of the merchandise for its more than 200 stores come from domestic suppliers.\n\nNo longer immune to tariffs\n\nThe Trump administration slapped China with fresh 15% tariffs on some $125 billion of largely consumer products on September 1. Whereas products such as smart speakers, T-shirts and footwear mostly side-stepped the first round of tariffs, they weren\u2019t so lucky this time around.\n\nAbout 77% of all shoes, clothes and home textile imports to the U.S. from China now has a tariff attached to it, according to research by the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nThe uncertainty around additional tariffs on December 15 hasn\u2019t helped sentiment on Wall Street for At Home or its rivals. At Home\u2019s stock has dropped 66% over the past six months, Pier One Imports (PIR) has shed 74%, Etsy (ETSY) is down 34% and Ethan Allen (ETH) has shed 8%.\n\nBird said At Home is preparing for the trade war continuing well into 2020.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have a playbook with our suppliers and we will be careful on prices,\u201d Bird said.\n\nPulling back on store openings\n\nAt Home\u2019s playbook also now includes fewer store openings.\n\nAfter logging its second straight same-store sales decline in the most recent quarter \u2014 a rarity for this one-time high-flying retail stock \u2014Bird has decided to slow down the company\u2019s torrid pace of new store openings. The company still has a long-term target of 600 stores, but Bird believes the time is right to focus on boosting profitability and cash flow.\n\nThe new At Home store in Foothill Ranch, CA will have its official opening on Saturday, March 30, 2019. The 75,000 square foot store promotes itself as a home decor superstore.

We have been growing 20% for the past five years. We think our stock is undervalued. We are a high growth retailer. We are highly profitable. We are taking market share,\u201d Bird proclaimed.\n\nTo his point, At Home is trading on a very modest trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple of 6.6 times per Yahoo Finance data. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times trailing earnings, while Ethan Allen clocks in at 18.8 times.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
