Jargon, vague promises, dire warnings, contradictory predictions, a few catchphrases \u2013 an alternately gripping and boring conversation that has been going on for years, only occasionally accompanied by actual changes to everyday life. It\u2019s a conversation that remainers have rarely controlled, let alone dominated. If they are, finally, about to lose the Brexit battle, this may be why.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s Brexit dream is to shred workers\u2019 rights and social protections | Owen Jones Read more\n\nFor all their ingenuity and energy since the referendum, they haven\u2019t done enough to undermine the messages that leavers have used to sell their project. Nor have remainers produced equally effective propaganda of their own. Much of the empirical case for Brexit may have unravelled over the past three years, but remainers still haven\u2019t shifted public opinion decisively enough.\n\nAfter the referendum result was announced, leave figures quickly began talking about \u201cthe biggest democratic exercise\u201d and \u201clargest mandate\u201d in British history. The first claim was incorrect: more people voted in the 1992 general election, when the UK population was more than a 10th smaller. And the second claim was at least debatable: the leavers\u2019 victory margin was much narrower than those in the UK\u2019s two previous national referendums. Yet remainers did little to stop both claims solidifying into orthodoxies, so widely held that to question them feels a bit nit-picking, nerdy, counterintuitive. The leavers\u2019 preferred frame has been placed around the referendum result.\n\nThe same has happened with who voted for Brexit. Again and again, they have been characterised as \u201cthe left behind\u201d: poor, neglected, Labour-inclined voters from the north of England. The reality that Brexit is essentially a rightwing project \u2013 to deregulate the British economy for the benefit of more hard-nosed, non-EU capitalism \u2013 has been largely obscured. Since 2016, a few dissenting academics, most prominently the Oxford University geographer Danny Dorling, have produced strong evidence that more Brexit voters were, in fact, prosperous Conservatives from southern England. But these interventions have hardly dented the conventional wisdom. From BBC vox pops to tabloid editorials to Labour shadow cabinet meetings, \u201cleft-behind\u201d leavers still loom disproportionately large. Remainers have been unable to identify and promote a similarly marketable political cohort of their own.\n\nAnother pro-Brexit message that has been allowed to spread largely unchecked is that it\u2019s possible to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d quickly and conclusively. In February, the pollster Andrew Cooper wrote in the London Evening Standard that when focus groups were told that an initial Brexit deal \u201cwould actually trigger a new and almost certainly much longer and more complex new phase of talks\u201d, there was \u201chorrified silence\u201d. That remainers have failed since 2016 to bring most voters to this realisation \u2013 that they have made Brexit seem a malign but largely abstract process \u2013 has been a crucial failure.\n\nYet perhaps the inability of remainers to control the Brexit discourse should be no surprise. The formation of the prevailing common sense on political questions is rarely driven by which side has the better ideas. The leavers have had most of the press on their side, implacably anti-European for decades. And the BBC has been strikingly reluctant to pick apart dubious pro-Brexit claims, for example about the supposedly overwhelming leave mandate \u2013 for fear, it seems, of being accused of remainer bias. More helpful still, leave has benefited from the tendency of most journalists, very obvious in recent days \u2013 see the breathless excitement about Johnson\u2019s \u201cgreat new deal\u201d \u2013 to prefer breakthroughs to stalemates. Rather than assuming that journalists outside the Tory press would always act as remain\u2019s allies \u2013 as fact-checkers against the leavers\u2019 half-truths and lies \u2013 remainers should have realised that a Brexit deal, and whatever uncharted world comes after, is simply a better story for the media than Britain staying in the EU.\n\nLeavers have had much of Whitehall on their side, too. The government\u2019s \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d campaign, launched last month, was officially described as Britain\u2019s \u201clargest ever government public information campaign\u201d. It may be clunky, but together with the equally derided Department for Exiting the European Union, established in 2016, the publicity campaign has helped to keep Brexit feeling inevitable, even at times when the government\u2019s flailings at Westminster have suggested otherwise.\n\nRemain has lacked such potent allies. Despite the huge economic risks of Brexit, business organisations have not opposed it with much intensity. Currently, the website of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) meekly hopes for \u201ca good Brexit deal\u201d that \u201cdelivers frictionless trade\u201d \u2013 as if the latter was a realistic ambition rather than a fantasy, shared by many leavers, for a country intending to exit the world\u2019s richest free trade zone. This month, the CBI has reserved its energies for a fierce but factually inaccurate attack on Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans instead. The episode suggests the CBI might be more assertive if Brexit were being pursued by a Labour government.\n\nGiven all these biases, perhaps even a more proactive remain propaganda campaign would have been doomed from the start. Yet the failure to mount one, at least so far, does reveal something important about the remain movement. It has not been focused enough, in a sense, not political enough. At times, in fact, it has tried to make a virtue of not being political.\n\nA wide but unwieldy coalition of liberal celebrities, lawyers, usually apolitical citizens, leftwing and centrist activists, and usually warring political parties, it has advanced \u2013 further than most people ever expected \u2013 on multiple fronts: on the streets, in the courts, in the Commons. But the movement has been so busy with all this, and with managing itself \u2013 the 48% getting to know each other \u2013 that it has not noticed how the underlying political narrative has still been moving in Brexit\u2019s favour, and has not done enough to reverse that.\n\nHere\u2019s why Boris Johnson\u2019s plans have every chance of falling apart | Tom Kibasi Read more\n\nIt\u2019s telling that the only two remain phrases to really cut through have been \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d (morale-boosting defiance for the already converted) and \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d (a call for a second referendum that is coy about how people should actually vote). Neither has the agenda-setting quality of the leavers\u2019 best messages.\n\nIn the long run, the remainers\u2019 rhetorical failures may matter less than they have since 2016. If Johnson\u2019s deal passes, and both the leavers\u2019 euphoria and the wider public\u2019s sense of relief dissipate, the Brexit crisis will still be there \u2013 but as a more concrete matter, less about rhetoric and more about economic and diplomatic realities. Remainers may finally be able to say the words that some of them have been itching to use for years: \u201cWe told you so.\u201d It\u2019s emblematic of the whole Brexit tragedy that the remainers\u2019 best line can only be used when it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u2022 Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the Guardian", "description": "Remainers had the better arguments, but they have failed to shift public opinion, says Guardian columnist Andy Beckett", "authors": ["Andy Beckett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0899842b25504be14df08b1aec4d62cf322129df/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e536d0b894cd4961213095d4e2964356", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
