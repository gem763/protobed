However, I handle my phones with extreme care so tend to prefer to carry them without cases or with very minimalist cases.\n\nTotallee offers three variations of ultra-slim cases for the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and I had the chance to try out a couple. These cases are 0.02 inches thick and weigh only 0.1 ounces so it is almost like applying a sticker skin, but much more convenient with better edge coverage.\n\nThe matte and transparent cases are available now for $29.\n\nSee also: Apple iPhone 11 Pro review", "description": "The Totallee cases aren't going to do much to protect your iPhone if you drop it, but the cases are designed to prevent scratches and improve your ability to hold onto your phone.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/6b386c89-f293-4fab-a688-40612b9472e6/thumbnail/770x578/771b0990588f9b8b74b561f63e5a08d9/totallee-iphone-11-pro-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
