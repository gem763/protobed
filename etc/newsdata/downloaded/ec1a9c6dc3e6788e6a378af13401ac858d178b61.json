At one point she let go and the pram veered to the edge of the pavement, the front wheels going into the road into the path of oncoming traffic.\n\n\u201cPolice had to take hold of the pram and on speaking with Miss Miller realised she was intoxicated.\u201d\n\nThe 27-year-old was asked to provide a breath sample at the roadside.\n\nThis gave a reading of 126 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath.\n\nThis is more than three-and-a-half times the legal drink driving limit of 35 micrograms.\n\nMiller's solicitor Ian Whiteley explained that she has three children and things are normally fine when they are at school.\n\nHe said: \u201cShe found it difficult during the summer months with the children at home full time with her (and had been) drinking heavily.\n\n\u201cThis time she'd gone to a friend's house and taken the two-year-old with her in the pram.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in hindsight she shouldn't have done that.\u201d\n\nMr Whiteley said that his client has now cut back on her alcohol consumption.\n\nMagistrates told Miller, of Leeds Road in Huddersfield, they need a full report before sentencing her on Thursday, October 31.\n\nShe was granted unconditional bail.", "description": "Ayesha Miller pleaded guilty to being drunk in charge of a child after getting spotted by police on a Monday afternoon", "authors": ["Emma Davison", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Getty Images Cultura Rf", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551998.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Couple-with-pram.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
