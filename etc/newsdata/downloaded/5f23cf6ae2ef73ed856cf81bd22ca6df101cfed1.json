Maybe, I don't know, we will see.\"\n\nHowever, the 2012 win remains the only victory the 30-year-old Youngs has enjoyed in eight Tests against New Zealand.\n\nAnd the memory of a 16-15 loss the last time England played them, at Twickenham in November, is still fresh in the mind of the Leicester number nine.\n\nOn that occasion, the hosts let slip an early 15-0 lead while flank Sam Underhill had a try controversially disallowed for a marginal offside involving Courtney Lawes.\n\n\"I've had a fair few opportunities against New Zealand. I suppose the most relevant one is the most recent one in the autumn,\" said Youngs, a veteran of 93 Tests for England.\n\n\"I just felt probably we were in control a little bit in those first 25, 30 minutes but they kept coming back,\" added Youngs.\n\nNew Zealand showed in their impressive 46-14 quarter-final win against Ireland the importance of remaining \"error-free,\" said Youngs.\n\n\"A couple of Ireland mistakes and they are down at the other end scoring off the back of it. The mental bit comes from staying engaged and never clocking off,\" he said.\n\n\"For me they (New Zealand) are the most dangerous team in the world at punishing you,\" added Youngs, also stressing the physicality of the defending world champions.\n\nMeanwhile, Youngs said he would be relishing his latest contest with the New Zealand scrumhalf, whether that be Aaron Smith or TJ Perenara, stressing that England would have to be alert to the threat they bring around the rucks.\n\nSaturday's semi-final will be only the second time England have played the All Blacks since Eddie Jones took over as boss following the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\"For me the best atmospheres I've ever played in is always when New Zealand come to town at Twickenham and I suspect it'll be no different,\" said Youngs.\n\n\"You add the fact that it's a semi-final and we are anticipating an electric atmosphere on Saturday.\"\n\nNew Zealand, bidding for a third successive World Cup title and fourth in total, head into this match as favourites.\n\nBut Youngs said England would take belief from their 40-16 hammering of Australia in their quarter-final.\n\n\"Come Saturday we will be in a position where we have complete confidence in how we want to play.\"", "description": "Scrumhalf Ben Youngs is hoping to add to his family's impressive record against the All Blacks when England take on New Zealand in their Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7926/57bb3d1defed468d838ed0b35d6f1518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
