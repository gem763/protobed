She makes sure to check the passengers of every car that drives by to make sure no one will put her in danger. In her family\u2019s area of St Louis, people sometimes turn to guns when they\u2019re having a bad day.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take that long for somebody to just pull out a gun and start shooting for no apparent reason,\u201d Taja\u00e9 said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the environment that we live in.\u201d\n\nWhy are so many black children being shot dead in one US city? Read more\n\nThe city has had the highest murder rate of any US city since 2014, with 66.1 murders per 100,000 people. This summer alone 13 children were killed with bullets. The safety of being at a home or around family is no guarantee.\n\nJurnee Thompson, eight, was killed in a parking lot during a Friday night football jamboree, her siblings and cousins standing around her. Kennedi Powell, three, was shot when she was outside playing with friends from the neighborhood. Eddie Hill, 10, was killed when outside on his front porch with his family on a Friday night.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to get a gun in St Louis \u2013 Missouri has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the country; it is an open-carry state that doesn\u2019t require background checks or a permit to have a gun.\n\nBecause St Louis is heavily divided by race and class, some kids living in the city are safer than others. In some neighborhoods, housing prices are higher and the number of murders is significantly lower. But children don\u2019t get a choice of what neighborhood they are born into or where their family settles.\n\nInstead, they have to adapt.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chante Bass, top right, hangs out on her front porch with her family in St Louis.

Gun violence can happen at any time to anyone, including young children who end up in the crossfire.\n\nChante Bass, Taja\u00e9\u2019s mother, stands at her bus stop on most school days, every morning and afternoon when she gets the chance. Her goal is simple: make sure kids getting on and off the bus are safe. She doesn\u2019t leave until the last child has gone home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chante Bass talks her son, Taron Henton, seven, and daughter, Taja\u00e9 Redden, 13, as they play outside their home in St Louis. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\nBass is the lead coordinator for Neighborhood Net, a program that has dozens of volunteers stand at bus stops throughout the city to ensure kids get to and from home safely every day. The program, run by the not-for-profit Better Family Life, was created in response to the uptick of children who became victims of gun violence over the summer.\n\n\u201cWhen adults are around, it deters people\u2019s actions \u2013 what they may have been thinking that is ill towards kids,\u201d Bass said. Even though Bass lives a quick walk down the block from the school bus stop, it gives her peace of mind knowing that she can keep her family safe on their journeys to and from school.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Damontez Sharp, nine, plays football in an empty lot between his grandmother\u2019s and neighbor\u2019s house in St Louis. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\n\u2018Sometimes it\u2019s not safe to go outside\u2019\n\nTaja\u00e9 is well-versed in the rules of playing outside. Games of tag around the house are safe as long as Bass is outside with them or in specific spots in the house. She can go to the backyard if her mom is in her bedroom upstairs. If her mom is on the first floor of the house, she can go on either side of the house. Security cameras are installed in the back and front of the house, but Bass says they can only capture so much.\n\nBass said she tries to be home as much as possible so her family can play outside. A park with a playground, a basketball court and a baseball diamond is a one-minute drive from the Bass home, but many people with drug addictions and sex workers are in the park. Bass prefers to take her kids to a park that is a 20-minute drive away but is bigger and safer.\n\nSt Louis is a lot different from Houston, where Taja\u00e9 had lived since she was six years old, up until her family moved back to St Louis in 2017. She remembers a time when she could play outside with her friends, without adult supervision, and feel safe.\n\nTaja\u00e9 recounts hearing gunshots fired at Easter this year. A woman driving by was shooting into the air, but Bass didn\u2019t know where the gunshots were coming from, so she ushered them inside the house and told them to get on the floor.\n\n\u201cThat just scared me because in Texas, we didn\u2019t have to go in the house. We didn\u2019t have to worry about getting in the house and getting on the floor because someone is shooting,\u201d Taja\u00e9 said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taja\u00e9 Redden, 13, plays with her nephews Damontez Sharp, nine, and Lamarco Sharp Jr, 10 months, at their home in St Louis. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\n\u2018They laugh about it, but it\u2019s not funny\u2019\n\nSometimes at school, jokes get made about guns that can be unnerving, Taja\u00e9 says, and some of her classmates seem less shocked by how prevalent they are in the area.\n\n\u201cThey laugh about it, but it\u2019s not funny,\u201d Taja\u00e9 said about the jokes.\n\nShe said on one afternoon bus ride home from school, some classmates had been fighting on the bus and as it arrived at one of the stops she saw an adult flash a gun, she thought as some kind of warning before returning to their own vehicle. The bus driver at the time said they had not seen a gun, she said, and her schoolmates on the bus acted like everything was normal. \u201cI just moved here, I didn\u2019t know how they went, so they were all fine about it,\u201d Taja\u00e9 said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me call my mom, so I started crying. They were like, \u2018You a crybaby.\u2019 I was like, \u2018How am I crybaby when I\u2019m scared for my life?\u2019\u201d\n\nHer nephew, Damontez, nine, and younger brother, Taron, seven, were on the bus with her.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to die, and I don\u2019t want to die. I was panicking, I was just shaking. I didn\u2019t want to see my nephew and my brother dead,\u201d Taja\u00e9 said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A school bus passes through a neighborhood in south St Louis, a block from where three-year-old Kennedi Powell was killed in a drive-by shooting in June.

He saw a group of four white kids in their early teens together, looking like they were having a good time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just laughing, they\u2019re not looking over their shoulder,\u201d Martin said. The image made him reflect on the young kids that he encounters through his work. \u201cTheir life is going to be so different from any boy I ever come in contact with because they don\u2019t have to worry about getting shot.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about somebody robbing them. They don\u2019t have to come outside and have to look around, making sure they\u2019re wearing the right color and aren\u2019t saying the wrong word, not going on the wrong block. They don\u2019t have any of that pressure on their mind.\u201d\n\nThe trauma of living in a stressful environment can take a serious toll on children\u2019s mental health. Toxic stress can damage a child\u2019s developing brain, ultimately affecting a child\u2019s ability to reason, regulate emotions and feel empathy. The stunt in development can actually be worse than the effect of having lead in drinking water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably more toxic than lead in the water,\u201d said Joan Luby, a professor of child psychiatry at Washington University in St Louis.\n\nWhile recent research points to all the ways that stress negatively molds a child\u2019s brain, it also shows that there are ways to prevent any and all damage, even in a stressful environment. If a child receives support through a caregiver that is attentive and affectionate, the effects of stress can be reversed.\n\nBut addressing the foundations of the toxic environment cannot be overstepped. Living in a dangerous environment puts a lot of stress on caregivers \u2013 a stress that is unsustainable without proper support. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t set up a daycare in the middle of a war zone,\u201d Luby said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chante Bass, center, tells her children and grandchildren to go inside for the night at their home in St Louis. Photograph: Whitney Curtis/The Guardian\n\n\u2018Mama, when we goin\u2019 back to Houston?\u2019\n\nDuring a car ride to his football practice, Damontez recently asked Bass when they\u2019re going back to Houston. \u201cI\u2019m like, man, they\u2019re over this\u201d situation living in this neighborhood, \u201cwe haven\u2019t even been home for a year and a half\u201d, Bass said.\n\nFor many families in north St Louis, dealing with the risks posed by the neighborhood is worth having a solid roof overhead.\n\n\u201cIf I had to choose something, this wouldn\u2019t be it. I consider all the time moving,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBut the size of the house gives us what we need, and we own this house, so we don\u2019t have to pay anything.\u201d\n\nBass is also closer to her family, including her other children and grandchildren, something Taja\u00e9 appreciates as well since Texas was a 12-hour drive away. \u201cI\u2019m closer to my family because all my family lives here. I get to see my family more often,\u201d Taja\u00e9 said.\n\nBass makes it a point to validate her children\u2019s value, teaching them that they don\u2019t have to be a product of their environment.\n\n\u201cIs it safe for my children? No, and they don\u2019t get to be kids, and that\u2019s not fair,\u201d Bass said. But \u201cmy kids know that their environment doesn\u2019t dictate who they become\u201d.", "description": "This summer alone 13 children were killed with guns in St Louis, Missouri \u2013 being at home or around family is no guarantee of safety", "authors": ["Lauren Aratani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aab0b720bb22d88ca1d0c17fac3bd1a073b83fa/516_392_2367_1420/master/2367.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2738a6d3064c915543678a13f5f068f"}
