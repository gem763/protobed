In an email, he described some of the technological advances that have allowed Trump and the Republican Party to leave Democrats in the dust: \u201cThe key is MAIDs \u2014 Mobile Advertising IDs. All of our phones have a unique MAID.\u201d\n\nFoxBusiness.com explains the utility of such IDs:\n\nPolitical campaigns are getting in on the action by working with third-party companies to track the \u201cunique identifier\u201d of voters\u2019 phones, matching that ID with the \u201ctrove of data usually connected to that same ID.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Fox reports,\n\nthe campaign will recognize the phone, knowing where it has been and the interest of its user, creating a portrait of the user. With this broad body of information, campaigns can effectively target potential voters with advertising, calls and send campaign representatives right to your house.\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican parties maintain and regularly update massive voter and non-voter lists that include details of credit card usage \u2014 magazine subscriptions, church and club dues, hunting and fishing licenses \u2014 that are all useful in predicting which candidates voters are more likely to choose.\n\nNow, Podhorzer says, \u201cimagine a file with that, and every piece of information taken from your smartphone.\u201d This, he argues, \u201cis the world we\u2019re moving to.\u201d In this new terrain, \u201cthe G.O.P. is running pretty far ahead of the Democrats innovating online, mostly because of their financial advantage.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s interest in gaining access to smartphones was unmistakably signaled in an arcane July 1, 2019 reference to \u201cbeacon\u201d and \u201cproximity systems\u201d in the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d on the Donald J. Trump for President website:\n\n\u201cIf you agree to allow access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may collect such location-based information from your Device,\u201d it said, and\n\nWe may also collect other information based on your location and your Device\u2019s proximity to \u201cbeacons\u201d and other similar proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the beacon and your Device and the duration that your Device is near the beacon.\n\nMatt Binder, a tech and politics reporter, wrote on Mashable about the significance of the new language:\n\nUsing beacons, campaigns can micro-target voters. For example, they can encourage voters to go to the polls based on their location. Campaigns can also use this technology to collect additional data by messaging users with questionnaires, email sign-up forms, and surveys.\n\nWhat this means is that the Trump campaign can collect mobile advertising IDs for smartphones in relatively small geographic areas \u2014 \u201cinformation based on your location and your Device\u2019s proximity to \u201cbeacons\u201d \u2014 at a Trump rally, for example, or a National Rifle Association convention or a meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nI sent an email to Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, asking what the campaign intends to do with the identifying information it acquires. His emailed reply:\n\n\u201cWe decline to comment.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats are clearly worried about the jump the Trump campaign has on them in digital tech, Republicans are ecstatic.", "description": "The technical superiority and sophistication of the president\u2019s digital campaign is a hidden advantage of incumbency.", "authors": ["Thomas B.
