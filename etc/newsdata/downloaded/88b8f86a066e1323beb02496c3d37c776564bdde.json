Warner said:\n\n\u201cEvery safeguard designed for the system was very successful and worked as designed: to gain as much information as possible, and protect the sanctity of the voters\u2019 identities and ballots. Although the details of the investigation cannot be disclosed, we can say that no votes were altered, impacted, viewed or in any way tampered with.\u201d\n\nWarner added that there is absolutely no evidence \u201cthat even a single vote was changed in the 2018 election,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cBecause of our hard work and our investments, all of our systems worked according to plan, and more robust security measures and protocols are being deployed ahead of 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, Warner\u2019s office communicated to the FBI that the activity of the attempt came from IP addresses linked to the University of Michigan. The FBI is now looking into a person or persons who might have tried to hack the voting app as part of a course on election security.\n\nBlockchain and democratic governance\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that decentralized application-focused blockchain \u00c6ternity formed a partnership with the Uruguay Digital Party to build a new system whereby Uruguay citizens and Digital Party members can participate in a variety of political decisions in a transparent and decentralized manner.
