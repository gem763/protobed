Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt was a subdued exit for the world number one compared to the chaotic scenes of a year ago when Osaka claimed her first major title amidst controversy after an explosive confrontation between chair umpire Carlos Ramos and an enraged Williams.\n\nThat match saw Williams deducted a point and later a game for her behaviour, which included a smashed racket and calling Ramos a \u201cliar\u201d, and provided the juiciest storyline coming into this year\u2019s U.S. Open which picked up steam through the first week as the two women again appeared on a collision course.\n\nOsaka is now gone though and, according to Williams, Ramos was never here. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that is,\u201d she had said when earlier asked about Ramos and last year\u2019s events.\n\nThe Portuguese umpire is officiating at Flushing Meadows but not in any of Williams\u2019 matches so for the former-world number one it is out sight out of mind as she continues her quest for a record equalling 24th career Grand Slam on Tuesday with a quarter-final meeting against China\u2019s Wang Qiang.\n\nThere were lessons learned last year in Osaka\u2019s victory and the 21-year-old Japanese, who will now lose her number one ranking to Australia\u2019s Ash Barty, said Monday\u2019s loss to the 13th seeded Swiss Bencic provided another learning moment.\n\nOSAKA\u2019S SADNESS\n\n\u201cFor me, right now I have this feeling of sadness,\u201d said Osaka. \u201cBut I also feel like I have learned so much during this tournament.\n\n\u201cI feel like the steps that I have taken as a person have been much greater than I would imagine at this point.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that I can keep growing.\u201d\n\nThe defeat means not only that Williams not have to face Osaka on the court, she will also not be dragged into questions about last year\u2019s fiery final, a topic she has made clear is off limits.\n\nTennis fans may still be seeking closure for what has grown into one of Grand Slam tennis\u2019s most infamous moments but the central figures, Osaka and Williams, have already moved on.\n\nRelated Coverage Defending champion Osaka falls to Bencic at U.S. Open\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that mad at this,\u201d said Osaka. \u201cOf course, I can look at this and be very disappointed and mad, but I feel like \u2014 like, I\u2019m not mad at it.\n\n\u201cOf course, I would like to reach higher, like, rounds.\n\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll do well in Japan because I always do well in Japan, and just keep building off of it to end the season.\u201d", "description": "The prospect of a Naomi Osaka-Serena Williams U.S. Open final rematch that hung tantalisingly over the year's final Grand Slam disappeared on Monday with Swiss Belinda Bencic the spoiler by claiming a 7-5 6-4 fourth round win over the Japanese holder.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425544353&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811MS"}
