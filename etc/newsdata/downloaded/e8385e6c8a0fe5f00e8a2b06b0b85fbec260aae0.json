But I have to admit, it always confused me. Carville meant it as a rebuke to any members of the Arkansas governor\u2019s staff stupid enough to forget the campaign\u2019s outward focus on \u201crebuilding our economy.\u201d But what exactly is the economy? What makes it \u201cours\u201d\u2014and just who are \u201cwe\u201d here?\n\nA century ago, most voters, and plenty of economic thinkers, would have found Clinton\u2019s slogan confusing. \u201cEconomy\u201d meant frugality and prudence. The verb \u201ceconomize,\u201d and the now-endangered high school discipline \u201chome economics,\u201d are lonely survivors of this once dominant usage.\n\nThe addition of the definite article, \u201cthe,\u201d changed the way the word was understood. Today, \u201cthe economy\u201d refers to the systems of work, exchange, and consumption in a particular place\u2014a city, a nation, or the globe. There\u2019s the Akron economy, the Ohio economy, the U.S. economy, and the world economy; there\u2019s a health care economy and an oil economy. The economy can describe how we eat, work, study, get sick, and die\u2014like the cash nexus itself, we use the word for almost everything.\n\nScholars have tried to pinpoint exactly when this great expansion took place. The historian Timothy Mitchell has argued that \u201cthe economy\u201d as we now use it is a creation of the 1930s, when John Maynard Keynes imagined a system of exchange that could be managed by experts. Mitchell\u2019s explanation is compelling, but language is difficult to pin down so neatly: As the historian Quinn Slobodian points out, nineteenth-century empire builders in Europe routinely \u00adtalked about building a \u201cworld economy.\u201d It would have looked quite different from a bank in London, the docks of Liverpool, or a rubber plantation in Malaysia, and yet the slippery versatility of the phrase obscured those differences.", "description": "Why politicians continue to pretend it's a living, breathing thing that can be nursed back to health", "authors": ["John Patrick Leary"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d15a044be43ab416b34a58b8bdb8d5c0b8af3887.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
