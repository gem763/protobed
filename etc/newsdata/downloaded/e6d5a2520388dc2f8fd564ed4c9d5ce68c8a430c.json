Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he \"could give a crap\" about the political fallout from President Donald Trump's statements about Alabama's susceptibility to Hurricane Dorian last week.\n\n\"I could care less, this whole thing is a bunch of garbage,\" Graham said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday. \"The president did have a model where it could hit Alabama if it went through Florida. This is the Trump world.\"\n\n\"The guy can't do anything, with the guy getting criticized by a bunch of people who just hate his guts and I'm not playing that game,\" Graham added.\n\nThe controversy kicked off when Trump referred to Hurricane Dorian and tweeted that Alabama, in addition to Florida and other states, would \"most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, immediately shot down the suggestion by clarifying that the state \"will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\"\n\nRead more: Trump reportedly wanted to show off his negotiation skills by inviting the Taliban to Camp David\n\nTrump would later go on to double-down on the claim by pointing to an outdated \"spaghetti plot\" map in which statistical models, based on an aggregation of data, presented a negligible chance that Alabama would be affected. The plot map did not take into account critical factors that determine a more accurate prediction of the trajectory of the storm's path and is not considered to be a meteorological prediction.\n\nThe plot map Trump revealed also noted on the bottom that \"if anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore this entire product.\"\n\nCritics accused Trump of spreading inaccurate weather information. Federal officials, including a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson and a Homeland Security advisor, issued separate statements defending Trump's claims, which they assert were accurate at the time he made them. (A CNN report, claims that the Homeland Security advisor was asked by Trump to make the statement. A New York Times report alleges that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened firings at NOAA after tweets that disagreed with Trump. A spokesperson for the department denied this claim.)\n\nGraham, an outspoken supporter of the president, said the hurricane debacle was a fixation that was fueled by Trump's critics. Graham pointed to recent reports that a CIA asset was compromised by Trump's handling of classified information, and characterized it as \"complete BS.\"\n\nFollowing CNN's original report on the CIA asset, other news agencies, including The New York Times and NBC News, reported new details on the matter.\n\n\"Trying to blame the president for something that didn't happen,\" Graham said. \"You know, other networks out there saying the president got a loan cosigned by oligarchs \u2014 when it comes to Trump, I'm very suspicious. You say it, then you try to verify it later.\"\n\n\"The president is a handful. He makes his fair share of mistakes,\" Graham added. \"But this story about the president damaging our national security is, I think, unverified and untrue.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: Customs and border officials at JFK airport check 1,000 bags an hour for narcotics and illicit food.
