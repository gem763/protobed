(VIDEO)", "language": "en", "text": "Joanna Jedrzejczyk defied speculation of weight-cut struggles as she tipped the scales inside the 116lbs limit to ensure her strawweight main event bout with Michelle Waterson at UFC Fight Night in Florida will go ahead.\n\nThe build-up to the pair\u2019s fight in Tampa had been buffeted by claims that Poland\u2019s Jedrzejczyk had told the UFC that she would not make the limit for the bout.\n\nThat led to a scrambling of scenarios over whether the pair could meet at catchweight, whether the fight would be postponed, or if others could step in.\n\nBut all of that was rendered redundant when Jedrzejczyk registered 115.5lbs on the scales on Friday morning, eliciting cheers from those in attendance.\n\n\u2018Karate Hottie\u2019 Waterson earlier came in at 115lbs, and with the main event locked down, that allowed UFC chief Dana White to vent at what he suggested were misleading claims it was ever in jeopardy in the first place.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe ANYTHING you read,\u201d White tweeted as he shared footage of both fighters making weight.\n\nDon\u2019t believe ANYTHING you read. @joannamma vs @karatehottiemma LIVE Saturday on ESPN+ at 8pm ET pic.twitter.com/v1QAbeXSNm \u2014 Dana White (@danawhite) October 11, 2019\n\nJedrzejczyk\u2019s supposed weight-cut woes have been the source of much speculation among MMA fans in recent days.\n\nTheories have ranged from whether she was merely playing mind games with her opponent, whether it was the UFC attempting to muster added interest in the card, or that the Polish fighter was in fact struggling, but found extra motivation to make the mark.\n\nWhat if the UFC is making up Joanna Jedrzejczyk missing weight to draw headlines to the card?\n\n\n\nI predict Joanna will weigh in at 116 or less. \u2014 UFCStats\ud83d\udcad (@TheUFCStats) October 9, 2019\n\nJoanna Jedrzejczyk told me last week her best friend Karolina, who is fighting cancer, is flying in for UFC Tampa. She said Karolina is her \u201cmotivation.\u201d It\u2019s understandable why she\u2019d want to do everything she can to stay on this card and fight. \u2014 Marc Raimondi (@marc_raimondi) October 9, 2019\n\nSo I see two scenarios. 1. Joanna is playing master-level mind games with her opponent. 2. JJ informed UFC last week she was having trouble w/ her cut (which is the professional thing to do imo) and someone leaked it w/o her being involved. I'm thinking it's #2. \u2014 caposa (@Grabaka_Hitman) October 11, 2019\n\nThe Pole herself had appeared relaxed amid the furor, sending out an Instagram message to her 1.4 million followers that quoted a line from the new Joker movie, stating \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get it\u201d along with various hashtags including #surprisesurprise.\n\nShe had also implored people to give her the \"time and space\" to make the limit, telling the media: \u201cEvery weight cut, your body show up different. Our bodies are clever beasts every like I said, every weight cut every time is totally different, different thing.\u201d\n\nWith any supposed concerns behind her, former strawweight champion Jedrzejczyk can now focus on rehydrating ahead of her bout, which sees her step back down to the division after a tilt at flyweight ended in failure against Valentina Shevchenko in December.\n\nIndeed, Jedrzejczyk, 32, may well see her bout against Waterson as a springboard to recapture former glories, having ruled over the division after capturing the title from Carla Esparza in March 2015 and going on to defend it five times.\n\nThat reign ended in a shock defeat to Rose Namajunas in November 2017, who also prevailed in a subsequent rematch. Jedrzejczyk has since beaten Tecia Torres but suffered a unanimous decision defeat to Shevchenko, putting her at 15-3 overall.\n\nWaterson, by contrast, is on a three-fight win streak, last beating Poland\u2019s Karolina Kowalkiewicz via unanimous decision in March to improve the 33-year-old American\u2019s nascent claims at a potential title shot.\n\nAnd while victory on Saturday would be unlikely to earn either woman an immediate shot at the belt now around the waist of China\u2019s Zhang Weili, it would at least keep them in the frame further down the line.\n\nINTENSE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n\n\nWe are locked in from the Sunshine State \ud83c\udf34 #UFCTampapic.twitter.com/Dyyl7E0eu1 \u2014 UFC (@ufc) October 11, 2019\n\nWith the weight-cut rumors firmly in the background, we can at least concentrate on the fighting.", "description": "Joanna Jedrzejczyk defied speculation of weight-cut struggles as she tipped the scales inside the 116lbs limit to ensure her strawweight main event bout with Michelle Waterson at UFC Fight Night in Florida will go ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da0aac285f5407fd224cacc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
