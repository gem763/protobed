After check-in, they noticed two framed pictures on a wall near the hotel\u2019s entrance, hung above a flower arrangement. One showed a young man wearing a uniform with an eagle and swastika badge, the other an older man.\n\nUsing a pseudonym, K posted reviews on Booking.com and TripAdvisor about a week after his visit, one in German and one in English, under the subject header: \u201cAt the entrance they display a picture of a Nazi grandpa.\u201d\n\nSeeing a Nazi publicly honoured at the hotel had made K and his wife feel indignation and disgust, the post said. \u201cThis made us wonder what the hotel owners are trying to tell us with this image. This incident speaks volumes about the current state of affairs in this region of Austria. Sadly, our desire to visit this mountain region has disappeared completely.\u201d\n\nThe owners of the hotel contacted both sites and asked for the reviews to be removed on the grounds that the description \u201cNazi grandpa\u201d was libellous and defamatory because the people in the pictures \u2013 one a grandfather, the other an uncle of one of the owners \u2013 had only been members of the Wehrmacht, the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945.\n\nBooking.com, which is based in the Netherlands, deleted the post, but the US-based TripAdvisor declined to comply with the request. Matching the Booking.com booking number to the pseudonymous review, the hotel owner then contacted K and filed a lawsuit against him with a regional court in Innsbruck.\n\nA lawyer acting on behalf of the owner said the portraits had been hung in the lobby in remembrance of late relatives, as was customary in rural areas in Austria. The picture of the uncle in a Wehrmacht uniform had been the only picture in the family\u2019s possession.\n\nThe fact that the Wehrmacht had been an instrument of the National Socialist regime, the owners argued, did not mean that soldiers conscripted into service could be defamed as Nazis.\n\nAfter researching the identity of the two men in the photographs at the German National Archives in Berlin, K was able to prove that both of the men had in fact joined the Nazi party, in 1941 and 1943 respectively. The hotel\u2019s owners said they had not been aware of their relatives\u2019 membership.\n\nThe Innsbruck court nonetheless took the unusual step in July of granting the hotel a preliminary injunction against K, arguing that his review had also implied that the hotel owner shared or sympathised with National Socialist ideas. The hotel owner\u2019s interest in protecting her reputation took precedence over the guest\u2019s right to freedom of expression, the court ruled.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue until later in the year, as is a separate case in Germany, in which K accuses another member of the owner\u2019s family of having harassed him by telephone to take down the post. The TripAdvisor review has been deleted as a result. The owners\u2019 lawyer said the family had since decided to remove the offending portraits.", "description": "Visitor posted on Booking.com and Tripadvisor about disgust at pictures in Austria", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aaa17be0b5b61d143ab1af4bca5eae00a229903/123_666_4995_2998/master/4995.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc9e2e0a2a481c7d8330728e808fe334", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
