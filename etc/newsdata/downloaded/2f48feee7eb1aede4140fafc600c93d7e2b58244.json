We have gone too far down that rabbit hole.\n\n\u2018If I stand it has to be not just because people trust me, people do trust me, it isn\u2019t just because people feel connected with that.\n\nMs Phillips made headlines after criticising Boris Johnson\u2019s language in the Commons last month (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not enough, it has to be about having a genuine plan for the future for our country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At that time, I would make that assessment about whether I was the best thing for the future of the country.\u2019\n\nShe added, laughing: \u2018That\u2019s a big ask of someone but I am incredibly arrogant.\n\n\u2018My husband is dead against it. He\u2019s not a member of the Labour Party but he does have a union vote.\n\n\u2018He would vote for me in an election but I\u2019m not sure he voted Labour at the last one.\u2019\n\nThe Birmingham Yardley MP said it is \u2018not impossible\u2019 for the party to become the largest one at the next poll but that a hung parliament is the most likely outcome.\n\n\u2018When I look at the polls, and I see the Tories are surging forward at the moment, I actually can\u2019t see the numbers where they make up the seats that they\u2019ll lose in Scotland.\u2019\n\nCorbyn\u2019s right-hand man in Cabinet has said the pair will resign if they don\u2019t win the next poll (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018If it was proportional representation then the Tories would end up the biggest party, but our system is weird.\u2019\n\nMs Phillips said last month that even if Labour were the biggest party after the poll, she \u2018can\u2019t see a way\u2019 for Mr Corbyn to win outright as he would struggle to beat his better-than-expected performance in 2017\u2019s snap election.\n\nShe added that Labour MPs should always campaign for their own party but called on residents in Uxbridge, Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency, to vote tactically to unseat the PM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe MP also accused the PM of leading a government which is deliberately stoking division.\n\n\u2018There has always been aggression and violence towards Members of Parliament, that bit isn\u2019t particularly new,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018The bit that is new is that people\u2019s political careers are currently riding on people hating politicians and are stepping that up for their own purposes, and that I don\u2019t think has been true before.\n\n\u2018It pays Boris Johnson\u2019s bills for people to hate me, which is s***. There is no way to avoid some of the risk.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just constant and you can never tell what is real and what isn\u2019t, and within that chaos lies fear. That is psychological warfare essentially.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
