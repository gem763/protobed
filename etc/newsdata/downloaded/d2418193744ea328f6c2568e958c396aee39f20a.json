Crew on nearly every measure in recent years.\n\nAccording to exclusive new data from web analytics firm SimilarWeb, the on-trend retailer can add yet another metric to that list.\n\nIn the first eight months of this year, U.S. web traffic to Madewell.com surged by 30.2% over the comparable period last year, and by 90.3% over the same period in 2017, totaling 3.89 million total views.\n\nWhile the absolute number of visits came in short of J. Crew\u2019s 9.23 million over the same period this year, J. Crew\u2019s web traffic growth rate clocked in at just 6.4%.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really see a lot of retailers at this size grow at this rate,\u201d SimilarWeb analyst Ilana Marks told Yahoo Finance of Madewell\u2019s results. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ll see a site that maybe just launched or is on the smaller side and it grows by 100%, but that\u2019s increasing from 100,000 to 200,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis type of volume and this type of growth is significant,\u201d she said.\n\nMadewell\u2019s web traffic growth also surpassed that of peer retailers. Anthropologie.com \u2013 the next closest competitor by web traffic to Madewell, based on SimilarWeb\u2019s analysis \u2013 saw traffic grow 18.2% in the eight months ending in August. Urbanoutfitters.com\u2019s traffic increased by 7.5%, and Freepeople.com decreased by 6.1% during that period this year. Each of these brands is owned by parent-company URBN (URBN).\n\nMadewell\u2019s web traffic data serves as another promising sign of growth for the company as it paces toward an initial public offering, especially given the digital dependence of its business. Madewell derived 40% of sales from e-commerce channels in the first six months of this year and had a brick-and-mortar footprint of just 132 locations as of August, the company said in its S-1 prospectus.\n\nCHICAGO, IL - A shopper carries her purchases down Michigan Avenue on May 30, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois.

The increase, albeit slim, suggested a growing number of browsers came to Madewell\u2019s website simply by searching for generic retail terms like \u201cwork sandals\u201d or \u201cdenim skirt,\u201d as opposed to searching with a variation of the company name in the query. The balance \u2013 and vast majority \u2013 of web visits still came from branded searches.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re getting traffic now from these retail related keywords like \u2018A-line skirt\u2019 or \u2018sandals\u2019 is actually a good thing,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThey already have the brand awareness. Ninety-two percent of their traffic is branded. So in order to grow beyond the people that already know about Madewell, this increase in non-branded traffic is actually very good.\u201d\n\nSome of this search growth has been a function of Madewell\u2019s own investment, Marks noted. Madewell said in its prospectus that its marketing costs rose by $23 million in the first half of the year over 2018, due largely to higher spend on digital marketing.\n\nBut these extra dollars did generate a return, with paid search driving 10.5% of Madewell\u2019s desktop traffic from 2% last year, and display ads accounting for 12.3% of desktop traffic, from 2.8% last year, according to SimilarWeb data.\n\n\u2018Billion-dollar business\u2019\n\nJ. Crew in September filed for an IPO for Madewell, grooming it for a public debut as growth at the flagship brand slumped.\n\nRevenue from the J. Crew brand has fallen on a year-over-year basis every year starting in fiscal 2015, and most recently decreased 4% to $1.78 billion for the fiscal year ending February. But Madewell\u2019s net sales grew by double-digit percentages every year for at least the past five years, most recently climbing 26% to $529 million.", "description": "Madewell's web traffic grew 30.2% in the first eight months of this year.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ww70UNmrbggQJt94pFrTpQ--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1d15b310-e570-11e9-b7ef-c7179d263b98", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
