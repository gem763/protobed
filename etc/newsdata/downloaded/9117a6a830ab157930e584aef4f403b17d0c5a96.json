NCAA isn\u2019t going to allow paid college athletes voluntarily.", "language": "en", "text": "The exact wording of the NCAA board of governors\u2019 announcement is the giveaway. Each NCAA division is directed to \u201cconsider updates to relevant bylaws and policies for the 21st century\u201d that would eventually allow athletes to \u201cbenefit\u201d from their own names and images, so long as they do so \u201cin a manner consistent with the collegiate model.\u201d What on earth do all those soft words mean? Here\u2019s what they don\u2019t mean: anything imminent. Or concrete. Or real. What they do mean is that the NCAA is in a panic over a raft of legislation that would make their current piratical rules illegal.\n\nAs matters stand, the NCAA denies athletes their natural economic rights, and hijacks their names, images and likenesses for financial gain. Ohio State\u2019s Chase Young is a bondsman who may not sign his own autograph for money or endorse a Columbus car dealership. Rather, the money generated by his talent, celebrity and image will continue to go to pay the $600,000 salary for some mid-level associate athletic director, and other cronies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat member of a university marching band is told that they must not profit from the trumpet so long as they\u2019re at the university? What member of a school orchestra is told they better not play their violin for money, or they\u2019ll lose the right to perform? What young actress or actor is told they can\u2019t appear in a play or a film for pay, at peril of being labeled \u201cdirty\u201d and a \u201ccheat?\u201d The NCAA has fundamentally violated the rights of scores of athletes by forcing them into a separate and unequal class of citizens. So, the NCAA\u2019s announcement that it has \u201cstarted the process\u201d to \u201cenhance\u201d athletes\u2019 ability to own what never should have been taken from them in the first place is not cause for congratulation.\n\nLook closely at the NCAA\u2019s verbiage and you will find buried in it some key phrases that show just how desperate its leaders are to delay, and to hang on to its ravening economic system. \u201cCompensation\u201d for anything related to \u201cathletics performance\u201d will still be \u201cimpermissible\u201d \u2014 for everyone except seven-figure athletic directors, of course. Athletes will be able to benefit only from \u201ccollegiate\u201d rather than \u201cprofessional\u201d opportunities \u2014 whatever that means. Question: Does a lemonade stands count as collegiate or professional?\n\nIn other words, the NCAA still will forbid athletes from actually making any money \u2014 unless it\u2019s such a small and paltry amount of loose change that it\u2019s not worth bothering over.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe board\u2019s action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert droned.\n\nCreate a path? The path was already there, created by legislators because the NCAA was so recalcitrant on this issue. California passed the Fair Pay to Play Act in September over the NCAA\u2019s baying protest, and Florida is right on its heels. California\u2019s law, set to take effect in 2023, would prohibit schools from punishing athletes for exercising their basic commercial rights. A dozen other states are considering similar laws. Then there is the federal measure proposed by Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) that would strip the NCAA of its tax-exempt status if it continues to restrict the use of athletes\u2019 name, image and likeness. Walker is trying to get the bill to a vote so it can take effect next year.\n\nThe NCAA is not trying to open a path for athletes, it\u2019s trying to kick dirt over one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe only reason the board of governors took this vote was because their position is utterly unsustainable. It\u2019s simply a bid to appease lawmakers, and try to regain the reins of the rule-change process before they are legislated out of existence in their current form.\n\nIt would be purely a mistake to allow this manipulation to work. Lawmakers should keep the pressure on the NCAA, and hard, because unrelenting legal force is the only thing that revenue-bloated body has ever responded to.\n\nLet up now, and the NCAA will spend years upon years holding \u201cworking groups,\u201d which will issue \u201crecommendations\u201d which will result in \u201cproposals\u201d which will then be referred to subcommittees. And the only thing that will come from any of it is more buzzwordy blather about \u201cmodels.\u201d Meantime, the rake off will continue and the kids who sweat to generate all the money will watch vainly as they are robbed of their natural rights over their own names, as well as the true value of their scholarship.\n\nThe NCAA has had years to make rules that genuinely benefit their \u201cstudent-athletes.\u201d They have refused, except at the point of a legal threat. What we need now are laws.\n\nAD", "description": "As public sentiments shift, college sports leaders try to buy time for their corrupt system by essentially telling legislators, \u2018Leave reform to us.\u2019", "authors": ["Sally Jenkins", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GZPywMFYXwX0ja2BB7qTnoUIDT4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJH2CQG6Z4I6RNZSHRZMX4JR6I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
