Value stocks trade at a lower price than expected based on fundamentals, such as dividend yield, earnings or sales, whereas growth stocks produce hefty and sustainable positive cash flows, rising revenues and increased earnings slated to climb faster than average companies in the same industry.\n\nThe top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now stand out in their respective industries but their full potential is not reflected in current share prices, said New York-based money manager Hilary Kramer, who leads the Value Authority advisory service. She chose a diversified array of top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now for people who may be seeking to buy bargain-priced equities that she forecasts will climb in the months ahead.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now Pay Dividends\n\n\u201cThese are the stocks that remain at the top of my income screen, year in and year out,\u201d said Kramer, whose 2-Day Trader service has notched 14 out of 15 profitable trades with an average return of 15.9 percent and an average hold time of less than a day since its launch.\n\nKramer\u2019s top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now are consistent, recession-resistant and have made shareholders much money in the long term, she told me.\n\n\u201cWhen Wall Street has forgotten about them and the yields are as high as they ever get, I tell my Value Authority subscribers that it\u2019s time to lock in the income stream,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nPaul Dykewicz interviews money manager Hilary Kramer.\n\nDividend Yield Enhances Top 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDividend yield helps to turn a slow year for capital appreciation into a decent one, Kramer said. In a bad year, yield provides a \u201cfloor\u201d to cushion losses and produce cash flow, she added. Just a 1-2 percent increase in yield can prevent 25 percent of all the negative years in the market, she added.\n\nDividend-paying stocks typically pay yields that average at least 3 percent, beating banks that pay less than 1 percent and the 1.64 percent yield recently offered by 10-year Treasury securities. With inflation hovering near 2 percent, dividend-paying value stocks provide an investment vehicle to more than keep pace with rising prices, before accounting for potential capital appreciation.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now Trump Growth\n\nValue Authority subscribers booked an average exit on closed positions in 2018 of 14 percent, beating the broad market by 10 percent, while also adding 3 percent in dividend yield, Kramer said. Between 1927 and 2015, value stocks outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.3 percent annually.\n\nA key tip for identifying value opportunities is to seek out stocks that should trade for higher prices but temporarily are below that level, Kramer said. Another screening tool is to find companies with enough cash flow to show the current price of the stock may be too low, she added.\n\nA utilities stock, AES Corp. (NYSE: AES), gained a place on the list of top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now due to its modest valuation, dividend yield that rises to 3.7 percent on its dips and fast growth that has allowed it to boost its dividend 37 percent since 2015. At that pace, a 4 percent dividend yield today would become 5.4 percent in 2023, Kramer said.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now Includes \u2018Go-To\u2019 Utility\n\n\u201cA lot of investors look to the utilities first when they\u2019re building an income portfolio, so AES is my go-to name in that group,\u201d said Kramer, who also leads the GameChangers, Turbo Trader, High Octane Trader and Inner Circle advisory services.\n\nAES is as defensive as any other utility stock and it hasn\u2019t risen much as investors seek safe havens, Kramer said. The stock still pays 3.3 percent, well above what\u2019s now an unappealing 2.9 percent for its sector, she added.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nBoeing Climbs into Top 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nDespite the Federal Aviation Administration grounding the 737 MAX of Boeing Inc. (NYSE:BA) since March 13 after two fatal crashes, the aerospace and defense giant received a spot on the list of top 10 favorite stocks to invest in now. Part of the reason is that its net income should expand about 10-20 percent a year, Kramer said.\n\nBoeing regularly boosts its dividend and most recently lifted it by 20 percent, Kramer said. During the past 20 years, Boeing\u2019s dividend has soared 1,300 percent, she added.\n\n\u201cBoeing is almost unique because its management truly thinks 30 years ahead,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe current questions around the 737 MAX will be resolved in a fraction of that time, probably in a matter of months. The dividend has been safe for decades and will only swell in the foreseeable future. That dividend growth is what you\u2019re buying here. Based on management\u2019s track record, they\u2019ll be paying $3 per quarter 20 years from now, or a healthy 5.2 percent for everyone who buys in at $380.\u201d\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nAnother industry leader that attained a spot on the list of top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The investment bank is embroiled in a scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign fund that led to criminal charges against 17 current and former Goldman executives in August 2019.\n\nThe scandal could require the payment of up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs for its activities involving 1MDB. The stock understandably has fallen and left investors wondering how low it may go.\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs should survive the fallout and rise again, Kramer said. Its current \u201cinsane\u201d valuation of just 8 times earnings gives investors incentive to buy now and stay patient for a recovery.\n\nA sweetener is that Goldman Sachs has hiked its dividend 55 percent in the past five years. The current dividend yield of 2.3 percent would jump to 3.6 percent by 2024 at that rate of growth, Kramer said.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nRetailer Ranks Among Top 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nRetailers usually fall out of favor with investors when the economy slows and sales become soft, but Kramer found one to love that still trades at barely nine times earnings. Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) has become bargain-priced in recent months and currently offers a divided yield of around 5 percent.\n\n\u201cBig Lots is a rare concept that works in the modern retail landscape,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe secret is that these stores can be dropped into vacant big box spaces that mall operators can\u2019t rent to anyone else anymore, so lease terms are extremely favorable.\u201d\n\nPlus, the valuation of Big Lots is \u201ctruly\u201d tempting, since so many investors have written off everything in retail for dead, Kramer said. The stock dipped enough in August to lift its dividend yield to 6 percent when the share price traded for barely 6 times earnings, she added.\n\n\u201cLock it in,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nTop 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now Include \u2018Big Pharma\u2019\n\nTwo giant pharmaceutical stocks, Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), also earned spots among the top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now. Both are based in Europe and offer compelling reasons to like them, Kramer said.\n\n\u201cBig Pharma is often a game of waiting years for the right entry on a stock you\u2019ve always loved,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cSanofi and GSK are two of those stocks for me. I love the franchise driving both of these companies.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, vaccines and diabetes are dynamic in terms of the amount of innovation that\u2019s being done, but as drug franchises they\u2019re extremely well positioned to fend off competition, Kramer said. Once a company gets the upper hand in either category, it is \u201cset for decades, if not forever,\u201d she told me.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\n\u201cIf I were buying one today, it would be Sanofi,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nSanofi features a higher yield now and offers further growth ahead, Kramer said. In contrast, GSK already has come a long way, she added.\n\nTo buy GSK, Kramer would want to see a \u201cbig dip\u201d in its share price.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nREIT Joins Top 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nA real estate investment trust (REIT), Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. (NYSE:OHI), of Hunt Valley, Maryland, offers an enticing dividend yield above 6 percent. As appealing as that yield may seem, it topped 10 percent early in 2018.\n\n\u201cPeople often think of the REITs when building an income portfolio, so OHI is my top long-term prospect there,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cWhile there\u2019s $4.7 billion in debt on the balance sheet, it\u2019s anchored by $8.3 billion in property.\u201d\n\nIf the REIT\u2019s management team felt a need, it would divert $800 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to pay down its debt faster, Kramer said. Instead, the company is refinancing its debt at 3.6 percent and planning to use the cash for expansion.\n\nREITs feature businesses that pay their shareholders at least 90 percent of taxable income, own properties that produce reliable rent payments and offer enhanced appeal because they have limited correlation to the stock market. Omega Healthcare is Kramer\u2019s top choice in that sector.\n\nFor investors looking for opportunities in a yield-challenged market, REITs offer a \u201cHoly Grail,\u201d said Jim Woods, who heads Successful Investing, Intelligence Report and Bullseye Stock Trader.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nTop 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now Feature Food Stocks\n\nTwo of the stocks on Kramer\u2019s list of top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now are J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) and General Mills Inc. (NYSE:GIS). Smucker\u2019s may be best known for its jams, jellies and preserves but it also has the Pillsbury brand of products, as well as peanut butter and coffee.\n\nSmucker\u2019s is not a sizzling growth business, but it is perking along well enough to keep its dividends increasing a little ahead of inflation. The stock\u2019s dividend yield tops 3 percent.\n\n\u201cBuy the dips,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nGeneral Mills is not a fast-growing company, but it consistently boosts its profit about 2-4 percent a year, Kramer said. That growth allows the dividend to keep pace with inflation.\n\nEven with its current dividend yield of 3.6 percent, General Mills pays a dividend that is twice as much as the yield of Treasury bonds, Kramer said.\n\nChart courtesy of www.stockinvestor.com\n\nDomtar Ranks Among 10 Favorite Value Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nThe aging population has created a growing need for adult diapers that traditional paper company Domtar has turned into an important business. The stock\u2019s price has fallen to the point its dividend yield now is 5.4 percent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say it often, but Domtar\u2019s secret weapon is adult diapers,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cAs the population ages, this is where the personal care business is headed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter all, the U.S. population isn\u2019t getting any younger, so senior housing will remain a hot spot for decades to come,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nWith negative interest rates in Europe, soaring government debt, trade wars, economic weakening, global conflicts and U.S. House action to impeach President Trump, uncertainty abounds. For investors seeking a place to collect dividends and not overpay for the privilege, the top 10 favorite value stocks to invest in now offer an inviting opportunity.\n\nPaul Dykewicz, www.pauldykewicz.com, is an accomplished, award-winning journalist who has written for Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal, Investor\u2019s Business Daily, USA Today, the Journal of Commerce, Seeking Alpha, GuruFocus and other publications and websites.
