So for most folks, it\u2019s easiest to follow the basic principles and pray you don\u2019t screw up.\n\nPerhaps the most basic portfolio management principle that\u2019s taught to novices is that stocks can generate higher returns than bonds. But also, stocks are riskier than bonds. Therefore, it is recommended that investors diversify their investments \u2014 it\u2019s why diversification is referred to as the only \u201cfree lunch\u201d in the investment world \u2014 putting some in stocks and some in bonds.\n\nAnd thus was born the 60/40 portfolio: 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between bond and equity returns is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern financial portfolios,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. \u201cIt drives conventional ideas about benchmarks such as a 60% allocation to equities and 40% allocation to fixed income.\u201d\n\nBut now, this might not be enough to generate the returns that investors have come to expect from the traditional 60/40 mix, which has returned about 6% a year since 1970.\n\nAs Woodard observes, bonds haven\u2019t been behaving the way they\u2019ve been expected to behave, especially relative to stocks. Specifically, they\u2019ve been spending more time moving hand in hand with stocks, and generally speaking bond prices have become more volatile. And at least some of that volatility may be explained by the fact that the bond trade is incredibly crowded.\n\nThis is captured neatly by the fact that both stock prices and bond prices are near record highs (bond prices rise when yields fall).\n\n\u201cToday, that relationship is changing, raising the question: is 60/40 dead?\u201d\n\nIt might be time to find a new investing strategy. (Getty) More\n\nThis could have some serious consequences for investors who invest this way. Specifically, when things get ugly in the financial markets, bonds may not offer stability. Rather, they may actually make things worse.\n\nFor Woodard, the likely scenarios for the next couple years don\u2019t look favorable for folks who set their 60/40 portfolio and forgot about it.\n\n\u201c60/40 may have thrived in the 2000s and 2010s but will not survive the 2020s,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEither global growth & inflation will accelerate, handing huge losses to bondholders, or monetary policy will prove increasingly impotent to confront global secular stagnation, resulting in more frequent recessions and bear markets.\u201d\n\nInvesting is hard. Even the easy parts.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
