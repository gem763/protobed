She then tied the knot to Richard Martinez, whom she has two children with, in 2004, but their matrimony ended in 2011.\n\nBy 2004, Snyder said her wild streak was in full effect and she developed an addiction to alcohol and marijuana.\n\nShe married her third husband, Val Torres Jr., who she has one child with, in 2011 before they divorced in 2014.\n\nSnyder married her high school sweetheart, Jeremiah Seawell, in 2000 before the couple divorced three years later\n\nShe tied the knot to Richard Martinez (left) in 2004, but they divorced in 2011. Her third husband, Val Torres Jr., is pictured right\n\nThird time wasn't a charm for Snyder - she says she then discovered Torres had been cheating on her for nearly four years and claims he was only interested in her for financial benefits.\n\n'I was calling out to God as my third marriage was failing. I was in a place where I felt I couldn't do ministry because my own heart and home were a mess,' she told the Christian Post.\n\n'My husband and I were in constant turmoil. I became desperate for the hope that I could be used by God despite my circumstances.'\n\n'I was calling out to God as my third marriage was failing. I was in a place where I felt I couldn't do ministry because my own heart and home were a mess,' Snyder said\n\nIn-N-Out heiress Lynsi Snyder was last year named the youngest female on the Forbes 400 Richest Americans list, but life wasn't always so simple for her\n\nShe said she has learned from her experiences that before the 'journey of marriage' it is important to spend time 'healing with Jesus'.\n\nIn the aftermath of her failed third marriage, she founded nonprofit organization Army of Love.\n\nOne day, she was driving through New Orleans when she heard Isaiah 61, in particular the passage which reads: 'He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.'\n\nWhile waiting for approval of a nonprofit tax-exemption for her organization, she met her fourth and current spouse, Sean Ellingson, who she has her two youngest children with. Ellingson is a former In-N-Out employee.\n\n'I find it amazing that my quest for love was fulfilled in my time alone with Jesus so that I was ready for my husband and my calling,' she said.\n\nIn-N-Out was founded by her grandparents Harry and Esther Snyder in 1948. It was passed onto her father before Snyder became the 6th President of In-N-Out in 2010, succeeding her brother-in-law, Mark Taylor.\n\nSnyder said her grandparents had set the bar high for her and she can only try to raise it.\n\nThe businesses' Christian roots are evident in the bible verse taken from John 3:16, printed on the sides of the soda cups.\n\nThe verse reads: 'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'\n\nIn the aftermath of her failed third marriage, she founded nonprofit organization Army of Love.

Rich died in a plane crash in 1993.\n\nThe In-N-Out burger chain is known for its simple menu and for being a hot spot for Hollywood stars. It only exists in six states, mostly on the West Coast.\n\nThe company's business practices have been noted for employee-centered policies and is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state minimum wage guidelines -starting at $14 per hour in California.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Orange Coast Magazine, Snyder said she has been the target of two attempted kidnappings.\n\nShe told CBS News in 2015 that her family back away from the limelight because they don't want 'a bunch of attention'.", "description": "In-N-Out heiress and devout Evangelical Christian Lynsi Snyder, 37, described in a rare interview how finding God had helped her to fulfill a deep need in her heart.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402614-0-image-a-99_1570462161052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
