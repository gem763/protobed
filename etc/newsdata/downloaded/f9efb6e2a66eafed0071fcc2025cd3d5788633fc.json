REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nThailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs, estimated by a local newspaper at around $2.5 billion, for infrastructure at the Erawan gas field, which it is due to hand over to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl in April 2022 when its concessions expire.\n\nReuters first reported last week that the U.S. company had \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d a plan to seek arbitration in order to allow more time for talks with Thailand\u2019s energy ministry, but that arbitration was still a possibility \u201cwithin weeks\u201d if talks do not succeed.\n\nThailand\u2019s energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said on Sunday the Chevron\u2019s decision was a good sign that the two parties could work together to resolve the dispute and ensure a smooth handover of the gas field.\n\n\u201cChevron\u2019s decision to hold off the arbitration process to continue negotiations is welcomed,\u201d energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said.\n\n\u201cI also believe that we will arrive at the best agreements while prioritizing Thailand\u2019s interests,\u201d he added.\n\nThe dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs of decommissioning all assets they have installed even if they no longer operate them.\n\nChevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971 it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable before it hands over the field to another operator.\n\nThe new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning all the infrastructure it has installed at the Erawan field, including still usable assets it will transfer to PTTEP free of charge.\n\nThe dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France\u2019s Total and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nOutside of the oil and gas industry, other foreign investors in Thailand were also concerned about the retroactive use of laws, and what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts.", "description": "Thailand's energy minister on Sunday welcomed a decision by U.S. energy company Chevron to continue negotiations rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay for removing offshore oil and gas platforms.", "authors": ["Patpicha Tanakasempipat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435188180&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0DX", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
