The automaker introduced this model by showing the performance-focused CT4-V in June. Today it is revealing the regular version and sharing more details.\n\nThe CT4 is slightly longer than the ATS, and it will be offered in rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations. There will be two turbo powerplants and a long roster of available technology.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far.\n\n\n\nOutside\n\nThe CT4 looks like it is cut from the same cloth as the outgoing ATS and CTS. That is to say, it looks like a modern Cadillac, complete with giant vertical LED headlights and crisp lines. The face is distinguished by the signature mesh grille design on performance-focused V-Series models.\n\n\n\nThe rear pillars are sharply angled and give the sedan a coupelike profile. The creases in the trunk lid create a sophisticated shape, where most decklids are simply flat. The CT4-V is distinguished by its four exhaust tips.\n\nThe dimensions for the CT4 are similar to those of the ATS sedan. It\u2019s about 4 inches longer, riding on a similar 109-inch wheelbase.\n\n\n\nInside\n\nThe five-passenger cabin has luxury touches, such as leather accents and LED interior lighting. Two traditional gauges (tachometer and speedometer) flank the center information display. The center-dash screen houses the latest Cadillac infotainment system, promising improvements over the previous frustrating Cue system. It features Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, along with HD Radio, SiriusXM, and OnStar telematics with 4G LTE WiFi.\n\nThere is an electronic gear selector, as in other newer Cadillacs and competitors, that tilts for gear selection and returns to a center position.\n\nThe Sport uses \u201cleatherette\u201d (faux leather) upholstery, and the Premium Luxury upgrades the seating to leather.\n\nThe CT4-V interior features deeply sculpted bucket seats, lots of leather surfaces, and color accent stitching throughout.\n\n\n\nWhat Drives It\n\nThe standard engine is a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder producing 237 hp and matched with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe Premium Luxury trim will feature a 309-hp, 2.7-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. This engine is a significant upgrade, bringing 90 more lb.-ft. of torque than the base engine, consequently promising more immediate thrust. This engine is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe sporty CT4-V uses a 325-hp version of the 2.7-liter engine.\n\nThere are driver-selectable modes, including Tour, Sport, Snow/Ice, and Track, to fine-tune the car\u2019s responses. There are also My Mode and V Mode (for the CTS-V) that allow further adjustments for shifting, suspension, steering and brake feel, and other elements.\n\nContinental self-sealing tires are available, allowing the car to continue to be driven after minor punctures without needing a repair. Traditional run-flat tires that can be driven limited distances after road damage will also be offered.\n\nEvery CT4 can be configured with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\n\n\nSafety and Driver Assist Systems\n\nThe CT4 will offer a comprehensive roster of advanced safety and driver assist features, but they won\u2019t be available on the base Luxury trim level.\n\nStepping up to the Premium Luxury, Sport, or V-Series trims nets standard forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and a safety alert seat that vibrates to warn the driver when needed. Adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking are optional.\n\nGM\u2019s Super Cruise, a driver assistance system that maintains steering and speed control, will be available later in the 2020 calendar year. This driver assist system has impressed us on the CT6 with its ability to balance partial automation with trying to ensure that drivers are paying attention to the road. Such systems are not self-driving and require drivers to pay constant attention.\n\n\n\nCR\u2019s Take\n\nCadillac\u2019s ATS was a capable sports sedan with enjoyable handling. But its appeal was dampened by its frustrating controls, uneven power delivery, and cramped quarters. The ATS did not find favor with owners\u2014both its owner satisfaction and reliability, based on our surveys, are below average.\n\nThe CT4 is slightly bigger. If it can preserve the fun-to-drive handling and improve on interior comfort while simplifying the controls, it will be a good step forward. Like the ATS, the CT4 will compete in the entry-level luxury category, which is largely filled with front-wheel-drive models. Its rear-drive platform sets it up to deliver driving dynamics that should appeal to enthusiasts.\n\nThe lack of standard advanced safety systems on all trim levels is surprising for a new luxury model. There are cars at half the expected starting price that come with forward collision warning.\n\nWe look forward to seeing whether the CT4 lives up to its potential when we buy one to test.\n\n\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.
