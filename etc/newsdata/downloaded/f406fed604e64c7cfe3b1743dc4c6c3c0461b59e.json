The Silicon Valley company in recent months has faced scrutiny in particular over Libra, its blockchain-based cryptocurrency, and Zuckerberg is expected to get asked about Libra on Wednesday, as the House committee\u2019s hearing is slated to focus on Facebook\u2019s impact on financial services and the housing sector.\n\nRelated: Zuckerberg unveils Facebook\u2019s new security measures to combat 2020 election interference\n\n\u201cWe see the Libra project compounding political pressure on the company, amplifying privacy and antitrust concerns and enabling more opposition,\u201d said Robert Kaminski, a Capital Alpha Partners analyst, in a note. \u201cWe expect questions on Visa V, -1.12% , Mastercard MA, -1.98% and PayPal\u2019s PYPL, -2.03% decision to withdraw from the project, lending credibility to lawmakers skeptical of the project\u2019s viability and ulterior motivations.\u201d\n\nRead more: Facebook\u2019s Libra battered by defections, pushback\n\nOpinion: Facebook\u2019s Libra unravels, and for good reason\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.72% wasn\u2019t far behind Facebook with $4 million in lobbying spending in this year\u2019s third quarter, according to its disclosure from late Monday. Both companies are staying on track to set new annual records in their outlays to influence Washington, as shown in the chart below.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG, -0.28% GOOGL, -0.26% Google business \u2014 which has been reducing its outlays this year and reorganizing its lobbying effort amid growing scrutiny \u2014 disclosed spending $2.8 million from July 1 through Sept. 30. Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.26% said it shelled out $1.8 million, and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.43% said it spent a relatively modest $200,000.\n\nThe lobbying comes as Big Tech deals with antitrust probes, and as some politicians say the Silicon Valley titans should get broken up. In the wake of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scandal and other foul-ups, the companies are also facing greater scrutiny over how they handle their users\u2019 data as well as how they manage misinformation and political bias. Lawmakers have talked up the potential for a bipartisan law that would lead to better safeguards for personal data, though analysts say it\u2019s unlikely because of a partisan split over the potential for federal preemption of states\u2019 laws.\n\nCapital Alpha analysts \u201chave been less worried about antitrust risk in the near-to-medium term,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cIn our view, the early federal \u2018investigation\u2019 headlines and investor reaction overstate the imminence and impact. We don\u2019t believe the government knows what they\u2019re looking for, what the problem is, nor what the solution would be.\u201d\n\nRelated: 4 reasons why antitrust actions probably will fail to break up Big Tech\n\nOpinion: The Big Tech antitrust investigation may be a political game, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will end quickly\n\nFacebook\u2019s third-quarter lobbying spending of $4.8 million comes after the company shelled out $4.1 million in the second quarter, and the outlay easily tops the company\u2019s spending of $2.82 million in 2018\u2019s third quarter.\n\nFacebook\u2019s stock has gained 43% this year, Amazon has advanced 18%, and Apple is up 53%. Netflix has tacked on less than 1%, while Google is higher by 20%. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.08% has added 20%.", "description": "Facebook Inc. disclosed late Monday that it spent $4.8 million to influence U.S. lawmakers and regulators in the third quarter, lifting its year-to-date...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT792_zucker_ZG_20191022115259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
