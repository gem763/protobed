Export growth increased. Private investment edged up point one-percent, while government consumption grew one.two percent.\"Private consumption in the third quarter slowed from a point-seven percent rise in the second quarter, making it the slowest pace of growth since the first quarter of 2016.The Bank of Korea attributed slower private consumption to falling spending on semi-durable goods like clothing.Government spending increased one.two percent, but its contribution to South Korea's GDP growth fell one percentage point compared to the second quarter.Facilities investment grew half-a-percent but construction investment tumbled five percent.Exports, a key driver of South Korea's growth, increased four percent on improving shipments of semiconductors and autos compared with the previous quarter.Exports have fallen for ten consecutive months since last November amid slowing global trade and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute.Imports grew around one percent.Real gross national income edged up point-one percent on-quarter.The last time South Korea recorded annual growth below two percent was during the 2008 global financial crisis when it posted GDP growth of just point-eight percent.The local economy is unlikely to reach Bank of Korea's growth target of two.two percent this year and it will have to expand one percent in the fourth quarter to hit two percent.Kim Hyesung, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
