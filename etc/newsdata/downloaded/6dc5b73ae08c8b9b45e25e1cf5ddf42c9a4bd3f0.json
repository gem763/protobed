It triggered a response from William as an insider told the BBC that he was worried Harry and Meghan were in a 'fragile place.'\n\nAccording to the source, who spoke to CNN today, they said that Harry was just giving an 'honest answer' to ITV reporter Tom Bradby, and that any sibling seeing that 'would of course be concerned.'\n\nThe source told the US broadcaster that 'the institution around the British royal family is full of people afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple who have single-handedly modernized the monarchy.'\n\nThe MailOnline has contacted the Palace for comment.\n\nRoyal commentators yesterday revealed The Queen and senior royals are 'very worried' about the direction the 'divisive' couple are heading.\n\nDuring the documentary aired on ITV on Sunday night, Prince Harry (pictured above) revealed his feelings about his royal duties\n\nJonny Dymond, the BBC's royal correspondent, said: 'I think they (the royal family) will be pretty horrified actually.'\n\nAnd royal commentator Penny Junor described the couple's actions as a 'big mistake'.\n\nToday Piers Morgan branded the Harry and Meghan Markle a 'cocky and deluded pair of victims' after the latest claims from the source.\n\nPiers said: 'This is astonishing. Meghan & Harry telling the Palace to get stuffed because they're 'single-handedly' saving the Monarchy.\n\n'Methinks it's time the Queen told this cocky & deluded pair of 'victims' to cool their ego-crazed jets.'\n\nHe added in a later tweet: 'Meghan & Harry have briefed CNN today that the 'afraid' & 'inexperienced' Palace can't deal with them 'single-handedly' modernising the Monarchy.\n\n'This is arrogant bullsh*t & deeply insulting to other royals, especially the Queen and Prince William.\n\nYesterday it was reported that Prince William and Prince Harry spoke to each other privately after Harry's emotional ITV interview.\n\nPrince Harry spoke of his mental health and relationship with brother William, saying they have 'good days' and 'bad days' and are travelling on 'different paths'.\n\nPiers Morgan (pictured) has branded Prince Harry and Meghan Markle a 'cocky and deluded pair of victims'\n\nMeghan revealed friends had warned her about marrying into the Royal Family, while Harry said he needed 'constant management' to deal with the pressures of his life.\n\nLast night, a source close to William told the Times: 'It would be very difficult for anybody to watch that and not feel compassion for them.\n\n'Whatever is going on is taking a personal toll on them. That, of course, would cause concern.'\n\nIt has also emerged that William and Harry have spoken to each other privately following the documentary, although it is not clear if William saw it in advance.\n\nDescribing how William felt at seeing his younger brother clearly upset in the programme, a senior royal source said: 'He is concerned, as anyone would be watching the documentary.'\n\nMeghan Markle was interviewed by Tom Bradby (pictured) for the ITV documentary\n\nA source said Prince William (left, with his wife Kate in Pakistan last week) hoped Harry and his wife Meghan (right with baby Archie in South Africa last month) were 'all right'\n\nInsiders told the BBC that William was 'worried' about his brother, hopes he is 'all right', and thinks the suggestion that Harry and Meghan want a six-week break from royal duties is probably a 'good thing' as they are in 'a fragile place'.\n\nBut royal sources scotched talk of William being 'furious' about the timing of the programme, which ITV began trailing toward the end of his own successful tour of Pakistan with his wife Kate.\n\nOne said: 'Actually I just think there is a really deep sadness there. Things will never be the same again, clearly.'\n\nThe source added: 'People will debate what he [Harry] said about their relationship, although the truth is, as he said, that they are on different paths and don't see as much of each other as they used to.\n\n'But that doesn't stop [him] being concerned about his brother. I think it would be difficult for anyone to see a member of their family talking like that on camera.'\n\nHarry and Meghan's interviews, which aired on Sunday night, triggered huge public debate about their roles in the Royal Family, with several commentators expressing concern for them, but one suggesting they should 'stop whingeing'.\n\nHarry admitted in the documentary that he and his brother, who were once inseparable, now have their 'good days' and 'bad days'.\n\nBut he insisted that he knows his brother will always be there for him, a suggestion that was repeated to the Mail by royal sources, who said that William, 37, would 'always have his back'.\n\nA royal source also told The Times of Harry: 'He has got a new wife, a new kid, a new home and a new office and is putting together the plan to launch his own foundation.\n\n'That is both a lot of change and evidence that they are both on very divergent paths. One of them has had a predestined path, and the other hasn't.'\n\nIt is clear that the two brothers' relationship is unlikely ever to be the same again even if the 'rift' between them, which began in the run-up to Harry's wedding last year, has been bridged by a fragile peace.\n\nIn the one-hour documentary, Harry and Meghan: An African Journey, presenter Tom Bradby followed the couple and their young son Archie on their tour of the continent.\n\nHarry, 35, said he still felt grief over the death of his mother Diana, describing it as 'a wound that festers'.\n\nMeghan, a 38-year-old former actress from California, admitted she struggled with becoming a new mother under the glare of the media spotlight, saying: 'Not many people have asked if I'm OK.'\n\nShe said her British friends had warned her about marrying into the Royal Family because of the scrutiny she would face, and admitted that adjusting to royal life had been 'hard'.\n\nShe said: 'I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried. But I think what that does internally is probably really damaging.'\n\nOf his relationship with William, Harry said: 'Part of this role, part of this job and this family being under the pressure it is under, inevitably stuff happens.\n\n'But look, we are brothers, we will always be brothers. We are certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and, as I know, he will always be there for me.'\n\nThe ITV documentary came just weeks after Harry launched an extraordinary attack on the Press, comparing recent media coverage of his wife to that of his late mother and saying: 'My deepest fear is history repeating itself.'\n\nRoyal author Penny Junor said Harry's decision to talk about his and Meghan's struggles was a 'huge mistake', adding: 'My advice would be to keep his head down, and I'm afraid to say, stop whingeing.'", "description": "The source told the US broadcaster that there had been a 'hysterical' reaction to the comments Prince Harry made about his brother William.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20041110-0-image-a-43_1571756648160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
