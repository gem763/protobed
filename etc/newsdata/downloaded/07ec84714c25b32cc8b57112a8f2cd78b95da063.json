REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nSpot gold fell 0.7% to $1,541.20 per ounce as of 0957 GMT, having scaled $1,557 on Wednesday, its highest since April 2013.\n\nU.S. gold futures dropped 0.7% to $1,549.70 per ounce.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they (U.S. and China) have agreed to restart talks probably has taken a little bit of steam off gold. We saw gold touching a high at $1,557, so it bounced down slightly; could just be an element of profit taking,\u201d said Philip Newman, a director at Metals Focus.\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry said its trade team will hold talks with U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for high-level negotiations in early October, while the ministry spokesman said Beijing opposes any escalation in the trade war.\n\nEuropean shares rose to a one-month high, with further support coming from a decision by British lawmakers to vote against a no-deal Brexit and the withdrawal of an extradition bill that had triggered months of protests in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, \u201cjust because the U.S. and China have agreed to restart talks, it doesn\u2019t detract from the extent to which that dispute has escalated and deepened, adding to a sense that global growth would slow,\u201d Newman said, adding there is still tremendous uncertainty about Brexit.\n\nGold has jumped about 20% this year as the bruising trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has sparked fears of a deceleration in global economic growth and encouraged interest rate cuts by major central banks around the world.\n\nAnalysts also said the likelihood of further easing in monetary policy and negative yielding debts around the world provided support for bullion, keeping it close to its recent six-year peak.\n\nFederal fund futures implied traders saw a 89% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve this month.\n\nLower interest rates and Treasury yields reduces the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver eased about 1.9% to $19.19 per ounce, but was near a three-year high of $19.64 it touched in the previous session.\n\nPlatinum dipped 0.5% to $980.21, having touched its highest since Feb. 2018 earlier in the session, while palladium was up 0.2% to $1,555.52 per ounce, holding close to its highest in more than 1-1/2 months hit on Wednesday.", "description": "Gold retreated on Thursday as investors booked profits after the metal rallied to a six-year peak in the previous session and hopes of a thaw in U.S.-China trade ties spurred demand for riskier assets.", "authors": ["K.
