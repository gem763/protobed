Joaquin Castro (D-TX) discussed House Republicans forcing their way into the secured room where the House Intelligence Committee was conducting a deposition for their impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nCastro said, \u201cWe were getting ready for the deposition to start and we had had a Democratic caucus meeting just before that of the Intelligence members. We came into the room. Everybody was seated, and just as the witness sat down you had \u2014 of course, you had Democratic members already seated, Republicans that were seated. There are about 25 or 30 of the Republican members. It looked to me like it was all the guys. There may have been a few women but I didn\u2019t see them. There are three entrances in that room and they all came kind of storming in. Most of them were not members of the committees, I think, of jurisdiction. They came storming in the room and started disrupting the proceeding. Shortly after that, I didn\u2019t see when the witness left but she left at some point. I think her lawyers escorted her out of the room, but it was a very tense several minutes while everybody was in that room. Quite honestly, it looked like a mob scene. It looked like kind of a mob party coming into that room.\u201d\n\nBlitzer asked, \u201cWas it a risk to national security?\u201d\n\nCastro sad, \u201cIt absolutely is. The reason that that\u2019s the case, this is a secured facility where a lot of classified information is kept. So whenever you\u2019ve got a cell phone, particularly a member of Congress who\u2019s often targeted by foreign governments, a foreign government with the right software or malware can basically take over your phone. So they can use your phone. They can listen in to what you\u2019re saying. They can basically hijack the microphone in your phone. They can hijack the camera in your phone. So if you\u2019ve got 15 or 20 cell phones in there because the members of Congress have taken those cell phones in, then potentially if any of those phones have been hijacked, the person who\u2019s hijacked them can see whatever is in this facility. So that\u2019s why I think for an hour or an hour and a half afterwards the security had to go and do a sweep of that secured facility. I don\u2019t know that anybody\u2019s ever brought 15 or 20 cell phones into that secured facility because there is all this classified information there.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of\u00a0CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Rep.\u00a0Joaquin Castro (D-TX)\u00a0discussed House Republicans forcing their way into the secured room | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Rep.-Joaquin-Castro--640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
