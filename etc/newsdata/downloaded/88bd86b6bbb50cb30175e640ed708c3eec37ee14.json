It's time. It's time,\" Trump said in a lengthy and wide-ranging address to the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservative activists.\n\nHe portrayed the Middle East as a hopeless cause, despite years of American military involvement and financial investment.\n\n\"It's less safe now. It's less secure, less stable and they fight,\" he said. \"That's what they do. They fight.\"\n\nTrump announced that he had directed $50 million in emergency aid for Syria to support Christians and other religious minorities there.\n\nBefore the speech, Trump was joined on stage by Andrew Brunson, an American pastor who was released by Turkey in October 2018 after nearly two years of confinement. The case had roiled relations with Turkey and prompted an outcry from U.S. evangelical groups.\n\nBrunson led Saturday's audience in a prayer for the president.", "description": "President Donald Trump says he's an \"island of one\" for removing U.S. forces from northeastern Syria.
