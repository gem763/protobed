Extinction Rebellion makes much of being a non-violent movement, but the violent response the train-climbing protestor gives to a member of the public trying to interfere with his moment of fame may go some way to damaging that claim.\n\nShortly thereafter another commuter mounts the train and engages the remaining protester in a slow-motion chase, which ends when the latter sits down to try and anchor himself in place, resulting in the crowd on the platform catching his leg, too, and dragging him down.\n\nThe British Transport Police have indicated that four arrests have been made at the Canning Town and Stratford incidents \u2014 although they have not responded to a request from Breitbart London on whether it is only protesters who have been arrested, and not have-a-go-hero members of the public who brought their illegal protest to an end as well \u2014 while attempts to remove a further four protesters at Shadwell by specialist teams are ongoing.\n\nThe BTP had asked Extinction Rebellion not to go ahead with the \u201cdangerous\u201d pre-planned protests the day before on October 16th, warning that they \u201ccould create a dangerous scenario where some trains are stuck within tunnels with hundreds of passengers on board.\u201d\n\nThey added that \u201cThe Tube and rail networks are one of the greenest transport methods in London, any action goes against what they campaign for and will only cause misery for London\u2019s commuters\u201d \u2014 but to no avail.\n\nEven London\u2019s left-wing mayor Sadiq Khan, who has otherwise been rather sympathetic to Extinction Rebellion, condemned their actions on the Tube, saying it was \u201cextremely dangeorus, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work.\u201d\n\nShocking moment angry commuters drag two #ExtinctionRebellion protestors off the top of a train in Canning Town and attack them. pic.twitter.com/EZAMa9tT2t \u2014 Mahatir Pasha (@mahatir_pasha) October 17, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "Extinction Rebellion got a sense of their support among ordinary members of the public when angry commuters dragged them off Tube trains.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/GettyImages-978847496-e1529493810799.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
