Ocasek was pronounced dead at the scene, with no sign of foul play.\n\nThe Cars topped the charts in the late 1970s and 80s, with 13 top-40 singles including Just What I Needed, Shake It Up, Good Times Roll and Drive. The band\u2019s sound helped kick off the new wave movement, and saw them and Ocasek inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nThe Cars broke up in 1988, after which Ocasek focused on his solo career. He recorded seven solo albums in total, and produced records for Bad Brains, Guided by Voices and Hole, as well as The Blue Album and the Green Album by Weezer.\n\nMusicians have begun paying tribute to Ocasek on Twitter, with the New Pornographers\u2019 AC Newman saying: \u201cI will never stop imitating the first Cars album. His influence will always stay with me.\u201d\n\nCarl Newman (@ACNewman) I will never stop imitating the first Cars album. His influence will always stay with me. RIP and Thank You to Ric Ocasek.\n\nMike Portnoy \ud83e\udd18 (@MikePortnoy) In the late 70\u2019s, in between my obsessions for Kiss, the Ramones, The Clash & The Sex Pistols, I also was a big fan of The Pretenders, the B-52\u2019s, the Police, Devo & The Cars...the 1st two albums are classics from start to finish. Sad to hear of Ric Ocasek\u2019s passing #RIPRicOcasek pic.twitter.com/mlIBnVVL80\n\nOcasek \u2013 real name Richard Theodore Otcasek \u2013 was born and raised in Baltimore. He started pursuing music after dropping out of college in the 60s, meeting future Cars bassist Benjamin Orr in 1965.\n\nIn 1970, Ocasek and Orr relocated to Boston, meeting guitarist Elliot Easton and forming the band Cap\u2019n Swing. That band would later undergo some line-up shifts \u2013 including adding keyboardist Greg Hawkes and former Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson \u2013 and morph into the Cars.\n\nscharpling (@scharpling) The first Cars album is literally perfect; there might not be a better debut ever. The rest of the catalog is untouchable.\n\n\n\nRic Ocasek was the architect. Nobody could combine pop hits with straight up weirdness like he could.\n\n\n\nWhat a body of work, what a cool guy. Rest in power.\n\nBilly Idol (@BillyIdol) Sorry 2 hear about #ricocasek RIP loved his work with the band #Suicide\n\nThe Cars\u2019 debut self-titled album, released in 1978, was a hit, peaking at No 18 on the Billboard charts and selling millions, with the singles Just What I Needed, My Best Friend\u2019s Girl and Good Times Roll also charting. The sound, which fused synthesiser pop tones with punk and experimental rock, broke new ground for rock music.\n\nThe Cars released six studio albums between 1978 and their split in 1988, with the height of their commercial success coming with 1984\u2019s Heartbeat City. The video for the lead single from that album, You Might Think, won the band video of the year at the MTV Music Video awards. Drive, the most popular song from that album, also gained the group some notoriety after it was played during the 1985 Live Aid concert as backing to some footage of the Ethiopian famine.\n\nThe Cars reunited in 2011 long enough to record another album, Move Like This, but without Orr, who died in 2000.\n\nOcasek\u2019s solo career, which included both making music and producing it, continued throughout the 90s and 00s, and he worked with a host of high-profile alternative acts. Ocasek\u2019s own work suffered from his reticence to tour, though his albums were favoured by critics.\n\nOcasek married three times. He met his third wife, the supermodel Paulina Porizkova, in 1984 on the set of the music video for Drive. They were married for 28 years, though Porizkova announced on Instagram last year that the couple had separated, saying that though they were no longer together, \u201cthe love we have for one another is so wide and deep it\u2019s practically tangible. That sort of love can never disappear.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by Porizkova and his six sons.", "description": "New wave singer behind hits including Good Times Roll and Shake it Up found dead in his New York apartment", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d26b20da4bcf557f9c9293b432db9ea52a2ad359/0_235_5312_3188/master/5312.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20c6ea6e456d6f59d6b28b54ff32fd88", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
