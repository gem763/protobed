The suburban department said he was wanted for burglary there.\n\nAuthorities say Blackman shot the officer in the leg and groin around 8:30 a.m. Saturday as police sought to arrest him, then fled. Officers eventually tracked him to a nearby railyard. Blackman was arrested after a shootout in which he was injured.\n\nBlackman, the officer and the woman are expected to recover.\n\nIn his food delivery job, Blackman had confrontations with security in a building where the woman worked, and it's possible that was at least part of his motive for shooting her, Deputy Chief Brendan Deenihan said Monday.\n\n\"Security always had a problem with him at that building,\" Deenihan said. \"He didn't have any confrontations with her.\"\n\nBlackman was well enough to talk at the hospital, but he wouldn't answer investigators' questions, Deenihan said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately known if Blackman had a lawyer to comment on his behalf.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
