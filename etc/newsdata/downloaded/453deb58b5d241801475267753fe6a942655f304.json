Crude oil benchmarks and , meanwhile, jumped about 14% each.\n\nGold Clueless Again As Fed Looms\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s early hours in Asia, it was back to anemic trading for gold, as traders remained nonplussed on how to continue pricing the yellow metal in the aftermath of the attacks and ahead of what would be an even bigger event for investors \u2014 the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, gold\u2019s clueless state now has as much to do with the hyper uncertainties in oil. While oil bulls and bears both agreed that the path of least resistance for crude in the immediate term was up, without clarity from Saudi officials on the exact turnaround time for the output halted in Saturday\u2019s attacks, it was nigh on impossible to say if oil prices should continue rising when they might have to drop instead. Indeed, WTI and both retreated in Tuesday\u2019s trade.\n\nVery Little Of June-August \u201cCharm\u201d Left\n\nBut leaving the influence of oil aside, since the start of this month gold has shown very little of its \u201cJune-August charm\u201d which effortlessly took it to six-year highs and seemed at one point even ready to carry it beyond $1,600. Bullion is up about 17% on the year, with virtually all of it coming from the June-August stretch.\n\nIn a column a few days back, I asked if the longs in gold will be ready to if the Fed cuts rates again on Sept. 18. Or will they be content to just land on the tree-tops?\n\nIf this week\u2019s activity is any indication, then tree-tops is the answer for now.\n\nGold Futures price chart\n\nIt's starting to look evident that gold will hang out at just over $1,500 or slightly below that, awaiting the Fed\u2019s rate decision \u2014 which will likely be another 25 basis points lower, just like in July, which most traders are betting on.\n\nRate Disappointment Could Take Gold Below $1,500 Post-Fed\n\nFrom there, unless Fed Chair provides sufficiently dovish guidance in his post-meeting , it's likely that gold will fall to $1,480 or around there soon after.Backing this prognosis is a note from Canadian broking group TD Securities, which says:\n\n\u201cGiven that the market is pricing in additional 60bp of cuts by end-2020, forward guidance will be key,\u201d analysts at TD Securities said in a note. \u201cOur base case is one of disappointment, resulting in a bear flattener.\u201d\n\n\n\nAside from the Fed\u2019s policy text, traders will also be able to see the \u201cdot plot\u201d, where officials of the central bank\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) give their own individual estimates on where the benchmark rate should be.\n\n\n\nEconomists say that for the median dot to show another rate cut, many Fed officials will have to dramatically lower their own rate projections. There is no certainty that the majority of the 12 voting FOMC members would do this.\n\n\n\nWithout indications of more easing on the dot plot, the market will count on Powell\u2019s news conference for guidance on whether the Fed will turn more dovish soon. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s constant heckling and demand for sharply lower rates, Powell has walked a fine line in balancing the market\u2019s expectations for Fed intervention and telegraphing to the world where he thinks rates ought to be.\n\nBut Gold Could Still Finish Year In $1,600 Range\n\nMy immediate tree-tops scenario for gold doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m bearish on the yellow metal in the coming months or beyond.\n\nOn the contrary, I believe that we need a safe haven and gold is still the best one out there as the world economy continues lumbering on a path that comforts no one, and the biggest wildcard \u2014 the U.S.-China trade war \u2014 remains unresolved.\n\nI still expect gold to finish the year in the high $1,600 bracket or more if the Fed stays in an easing mode through its October and December meetings.\n\nAnd if that momentum carries into 2020, gold could even launch an assault on the all-time highs above $1,900 that it achieved in U.S. dollars back in 2011.
