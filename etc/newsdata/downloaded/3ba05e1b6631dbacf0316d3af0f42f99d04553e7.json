Next to his home, in Somerset, England, the most expensive power station in the world is slowly rising. Sam is deeply concerned about the effects of Hinkley Point on the environment. He tries to sound the alarm to his elementary-school friends.\n\n\u201cIf that power station that they built starts to leak a bit, all that radioactivity would just [spread] through the country,\u201d Sam says in \u00d6mer Sami\u2019s short documentary, Sam and the Plant Next Door. \u201cIt\u2019s very poisonous\u2014you could die from it. One thing that really bugs me is that corporations are doing really bad things to the environment all the time.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many of Sam\u2019s friends will end up working for Hinkley Point. The plant\u2014a complex financial agreement between \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF) and China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN)\u2014is expected to create 25,000 jobs and generate support for local businesses and education. But the precocious Sam feels a responsibility to mitigate Hinkley\u2019s threat to the planet.\n\nWith a keen eye for nuance, Sami\u2019s stunning film follows the young boy as he grapples with difficult truths about the world he\u2019s trying to save. Ultimately, Sam will face a dilemma that puts his idealism in conflict with his family\u2019s economic reality: Should he accept scholarship funds from EDF in order to attend a prestigious private school, where he can study marine biology?\n\nSami was initially drawn to the young boy\u2019s story because its ethical quandaries reflect universal truths. \u201cHis convictions were mostly at odds with the world around him,\u201d Sami told me. After finishing the film, Sami was struck by the vitality of the youth-led environmental awareness and activism movement, led by Greta Thunberg, that had emerged. \u201cThis new generation of Greta and Sam\u2019s are united in their frustration in being disregarded by adults who are unwilling to take responsibility and act on the information that is all around us,\u201d he said.\n\nIn one scene in the film, a representative from Hinkley Point comes to speak to Sam\u2019s classroom about future job opportunities at the plant. \u201cWhere do you think you will be in 30 years\u2019 time?\u201d the rep asks the class. For Sam, the question looms in the air with the specter of climate change.", "description": "Sam faces a dilemma as he comes of age in the shadow of Britain's largest power plant.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/08/Sam_and_the_Plant_Next_Door/video-featured.jpg"}
