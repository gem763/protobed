Accordingly, the research group made up the Heart Foundation, VicHealth and The George Insistute for Global Health is calling on the government to set voluntary salt targets for the food industry.\n\nThe humble falafel might be cruelty-free, but it also might be killing you.\n\nThat\u2019s the suggestion out of new Australian research that proposes the country\u2019s increasing taste for a meat-free diet might be based on a national love of salt.\n\nOf some 190 meat-free products available in Australia, some had as much as half the recommended salt intake in a single-serve, a survey by The George Institute for Global Health, VicHealth, and the Heart Foundation found.\n\n\u201cOur research showed that there are large ranges in the amount of salt between meat alternative products,\u201d Heart Foundation dietitian Sian Armstrong said in a note on the research.\n\nIncreased salt intake puts Australians at greater risk of heart attacks, kidney disease and stroke, with Armstrong encouraging people to compare before they consume.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to choose a healthier item by picking the lower salt option. It also clearly shows that manufacturers can produce products that are much lower in salt,\u201d she said.\n\nYou need only look as far as one of the country\u2019s favourite snacks \u2014 the falafel.\n\n\u201cMonjay Mezza Traditional Falafel and Spinach Falafel proved saltiest with three grams of salt per 100 grams \u2013- 10 times saltier than the falafels with the least amount of salt, Naturally Falafel varieties,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nThe worst offenders overall, however, was a vegan pie which contained 2.5 grams of salt per serve. Current World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines recommend Australians restrict their intake to no more than 5 grams per day, although we consume nearly twice that on average.\n\nVegetarians and vegans could be helping bring that average up, with meat-free bacon on average accounting for 2 grams per serve \u2014 more than real bacon contains. Meanwhile on average, falafels and meat-free sausages both carry 1.3 grams.\n\nSimilarly, meat-free fastfood like Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger, for example, both have higher sodium than their meaty competitors, even though they contain less fat and fewer calories.\n\nIt goes to show that, despite an explosion of meat-free products to cater for an estimated 2.5 million meat-free Australians, nutritional quality remains a problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that, in nearly a decade, there has been no change to the salt levels in any of the meat alternative products we looked at, and that new products coming on to the market are so high in salt, despite government commitments to reduce population salt intake,\u201d George Institute senior public health nutritionist Clare Farrand said.\n\nShe proposed that the Australian government take the lead from the UK and set salt targets for the food industry.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the entire industry is awash in sodium, vegetarians just need to take a little care.\n\n\u201cThe growing number of Australians choosing to eat more plant-based foods is a positive move for health, but it is important that people focus on the quality and sources of plant foods, as some can be highly processed and lacking in nutrients,\u201d Heart Foundation CEO Victoria Kellie-Ann Jolly said.\n\n\u201cMeat alternatives such as tofu and falafel can be good protein sources as part of a healthy balanced diet, but with any processed or packaged foods, it\u2019s critical not to rely on words or images that make a product appear healthier than it is. Check the label and pick the less salty option.\u201d\n\nNow that\u2019s some advice to chew on.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
