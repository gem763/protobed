He is now where he belongs.\n\nPutman was jailed for nine years for using a fake lottery ticket to cash in an unclaimed \u00a32.5 million jackpot (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018He could be entertaining, he was funny, he made everyone laugh. Everyone thought he was the life and soul.\n\n\u2018But he was a monster. For the sake of everybody, not just me, it is good that he is going down for a very long time.\n\n\u2018I will be celebrating when he is behind bars. What he has done has had an impact on women and children.\n\n\u2018He has stolen, he is a dangerous, violent abuser.\u2019\n\n\u2018I always knew what he was capable of\u2026 but nobody else did. Until now.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018He knew I was expecting when he attacked me. He said every time I screamed he would punch me again.\n\n\u2018It happened about 20 more times. I really thought my head was going to cave in.\u2019\n\nThe fake National Lottery ticket used by the conman (Picture: PA)\n\nThe builder, of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, was sentenced to seven years for the rape and ordered to pay his victim \u00a350,000 in compensation.\n\nYesterday, he was found guilty of fraud by false representation by jurors at St Albans Crown Court after he conspired with friend Giles Knibbs to swindle the lottery system.\n\nThe pair submitted a counterfeit slip to land the unclaimed \u00a32.5 million in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs took his own life in October 2015 after fearing he would go down for \u201910 to 15 years for blackmail\u2019, the trial heard.\n\nThe co-conspirators had fought over how the money was divided, with Mr Knibbs breaking Putman\u2019s wing mirrors and stealing his phone during a heated argument in June 2015.\n\nWhile he was passing the conman\u2019s sentence, Judge Philip Grey said the \u2018sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud\u2019 struck at the heart of the integrity of the National Lottery.\n\nHe said: \u2018You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy.\n\nPutman (right) arrives at St Albans Magistrates\u2019 Court for his trial (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Whatever the exact monetary split you and Mr Knibbs had agreed, you did not pay him what split he felt he was owed. The two of you fell out spectacularly.\n\n\u2018This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public\u2019s trust in the lottery itself.\u2019\n\nThe judge added that the fact Camelot had been \u2018hoodwinked in this way will of course be damaging to its reputation\u2019.\n\nThe genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been found.\n\nA Camelot spokesman said the case was a \u2018unique, one-off incident over a decade ago\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018There were some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we\u2019re very sorry for that.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
