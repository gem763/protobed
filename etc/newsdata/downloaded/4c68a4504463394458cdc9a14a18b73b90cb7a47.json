Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) told constituents on Tuesday that her Democrat colleagues are looking into how to arrest White House officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas as part of an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking to her constituents at a town hall in her hometown of Detriot, Tlaib said Democrats are puzzled about how to arrest Cabinet secretaries, telling voters in a video captured by America Rising PAC that they could be taken into custody if Congress votes to hold them in contempt.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve ever had a situation like this,\u201d said Tlaib. \u201cSo they\u2019re trying to figure out, no joke, is it the D.C. police that goes and gets them? We don\u2019t know. Where do we hold them?\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d and \u201ctrying to tread carefully,\u201d the Michigan Democrat went on.\n\n\u201cI will tell them they can hold all those people right here in Detroit,\u201d she quipped \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them and make sure they show up to the committee hearings.\u201d\n\nTlaib\u2019s comments came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote a blistering letter to Congress in which he declared that House Democrats are attempting to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d State Department officials with subpoenas seeking their testimony.\n\nFurther, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight committees have set an October 4th deadline for Pompeo to produce documents related to their investigation of President Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine.\n\nThe investigations are part of a formal impeachment inquiry sparked by a partisan CIA officer, who in a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint, alleged the president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden. Both presidents have denied any pressure was applied to probe into the Biden family, and the White House, in a nod to transparency, has released a transcript of their July 25th call.\n\nA day prior to Tlaib\u2019s remarks, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged that President Trump be thrown in jail and put in solitary confinement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on the GOP to stop Trump\u2019s filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed. Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe AP contributed to this report.", "description": "Rashida Tlaib told\u00a0constituents that Democrats are looking into how to arrest White House officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Rashida-Tlaib-Impeach-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
