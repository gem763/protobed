This Parliament must either stand aside \u2026 or bring a vote of confidence and finally face a day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d\n\nBORIS JOHNSON'S SUSPENSION OF PARLIAMENT RULED UNLAWFUL BY UK SUPREME COURT\n\nIt was his first remarks to the legislature since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that deemed Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament earlier this month to be illegal.\n\nJohnson, who had just returned from a shortened trip from the U.N. General Assembly in New York, accused opposition lawmakers of having an \u201cobsessive desire\u201d to overrule Brexit referendum instead of honoring it.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care if another year or more is wasted in arguing about a referendum,\u201d he claimed. \u201cAll that matters is an obsessive desire to overrule the referendum result while we want to take out country up a gear.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's five-week prorogation -- or suspension of Parliament -- was \u201cvoid and of no effect.\u201d The high court said Johnson\u2019s government, instead, shut down the legislature in an effort to squelch debate on Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU, set for Oct. 31.\n\nAfter the ruling, Johnson said he \u201cstrongly\u201d disagreed with the court\u2019s decision \u2013 a sentiment emphasized Wednesday in front of the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cI thought the court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy,\u201d he said.\n\nBREXIT SAGA: WHAT HAPPENS NOW AFTER SUSPENSION OF UK PARLIAMENT RULED ILLEGAL?\n\nIn response, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, rejected Johnson\u2019s taunting demand for a no-confidence vote and called the prime minister\u2019s remarks \u201cten minutes of bluster\u201d that \u201cshould be quashed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis government is failing the people of Britain and the people of Britain know it,\u201d he claimed before adding: \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s ruling, the prime minister should have done the honorable thing and resigned. Yet here he is, forced back to this house \u2026 with no shred of remorse or humility or, of course, no substance whatsoever.\u201d\n\nCorbyn said he won\u2019t support a new election unless a no-deal Brexit is ruled out. Instead, he said, Johnson should secure a delay to Brexit \u2013 scheduled for Oct. 21 \u2013 and \u201cthen let\u2019s have an election.\u201d\n\nBORIS JOHNSON TELLS THE UN BREXIT IS LIKE HAVING ONE'S LIVER PECKED OUT BY AN EAGLE FOR ALL ETERNITY\n\nJohnson wants to hold an election in hope of breaking the stalemate over Brexit that has left Britain's departure in limbo. If the government lost a no-confidence vote, a two-week period would be triggered in which Johnson or another lawmaker could try to form a new government and win a subsequent confidence vote. If that failed, there would be an election.\n\nEarlier this month, British lawmakers twice rejected a call for a snap poll. Opposition lawmakers said they won\u2019t trigger an election until the risk of crashing out of the European Union next month without a divorce deal has been eliminated.\n\nThe heated exchange came just hours after British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox sparked furor in the House of Commons when he claimed that Parliament is \u201cdead\u201d and that lawmakers have \u201cno moral right to sit on these green benches.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s baritone boomed across the House of Commons as he defended the advice he gave the prime minister backing the suspension, saying the government acted in \u201cgood faith.\u201d He also aggressively attacked lawmakers for being \u201ctoo cowardly\u201d to vote for a no-confidence motion in Johnson\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThis parliament is a dead parliament. It should no longer sit. It has no moral right to sit on these green benches,\u201d Cox said, adding that the legislature was a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThis parliament should have the courage to face the electorate, but it won\u2019t because so many of them are really all about preventing us from leaving the European Union. But the time is coming. The time is coming, Mr. Speaker, when even these turkeys won\u2019t be able to prevent Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The embattled British prime minister demanded a \u201cday of reckoning with the voters\u201d when he seemingly challenged opposition lawmakers take down his government with a no-confidence vote amid the tumultuous Brexit negotiations that have split lawmakers.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19268376494196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
