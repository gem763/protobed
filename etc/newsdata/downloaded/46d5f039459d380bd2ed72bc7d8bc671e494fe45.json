Groups of between 9 and 11 swing voters in those 3 states answered questions about a range of topics, including climate change. (Check out my colleague Alexi McCammond\u2019s broader coverage.)\n\nThe participants were a mix of voters who either voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and flipped to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 or voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016.\n\nThese focus groups, conducted by the nonpartisan research firms Engagious and Focus Pointe Global, are a small handful of voters and don\u2019t offer a statistically significant sample like a poll.\n\nBut the responses provide a richer snapshot of how some voters in key counties are thinking about climate change in the 2020 election.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: The participants were asked the following fill-in-the-blank exercise: Climate change is a ____. Of the more than 2 dozen responses, most (14) chose words that somehow described climate change as a problem, with \u201cconcern\u201d being the most common word.\n\nJust 4 people chose words that made it clear they roundly dismissed climate change as a problem at all (like Trump), with one Obama-Trump voter calling it a joke and another saying it was \u201cscientifically unproven.\u201d\n\nNobody described climate change as an emergency.\n\nOther words mentioned: \u201cbig issue,\u201d \u201caddressable issue\u201d and \u201csomething scary.\u201d\n\nTheir stated degree of urgency is a key factor in whether climate change becomes a big enough priority to help determine their vote. Although this topic is getting more attention this election than it has perhaps ever before, these lukewarm reactions suggest it\u2019s still not breaking through.\n\nMost of the swing voters in the focus groups didn\u2019t rank it in the top 5 of their priorities.\n\nPolling, meanwhile, shows more Americans are worried about climate change and want action on the matter, but nearly all of the increased concern is coming from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of other issues competing for voters\u2019 attention, so if they perceive it\u2019s not urgent, there\u2019s a tendency to put it on the back burner,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, senior research scientist and director of Yale University\u2019s Program on Climate Change Communication.\n\nBetween the lines: Climate change is unlike any other problem facing the world given its centuries-long time horizon and uneven impact (as I detailed in these two recent columns).\n\nScientists are increasingly sounding the alarm about the mostly negative, and at times catastrophic, impacts that climate change is already having and is likely to have in the decades to come.\n\nBut to people who are worried about paying big health care bills or losing their jobs in a matter of months due to a slowing economy, any problem playing out over decades will inevitably not rise to the top. Or, if it does make it to the top, it doesn\u2019t stay there long.\n\nDriving the news: In the political arena, the rhetoric is intensifying. Activists and many progressive politicians are increasingly calling climate change an emergency, while most Democrats say it\u2019s a crisis. Certain media outlets are revamping their coverage and, in some cases, changing their style books.\n\nSome Republicans, meanwhile, are starting to acknowledge the problem after years of mostly ignoring it. At the same time, Republicans are turned off by the more aggressive language many on the left are using.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching: When asked if climate change is an emergency, one of the Obama-Trump voters in Minnesota said her daughter would describe it that way. I'm watching to what degree younger voters \u2014 who polling suggests are more worried about climate than older generations \u2014 retain that sense of urgency as they get older. This could determine whether climate change will be a more decisive issue in future elections.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
