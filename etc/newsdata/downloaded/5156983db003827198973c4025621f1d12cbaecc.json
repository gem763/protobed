Rick Scott (R-FL), in particular, wanted to get to the facts.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get all the facts out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we ought to have the facts out about that. And we ought to get the facts out about what Biden has said\u2026 We don\u2019t know exactly the facts. Let\u2019s get the facts on both of those issues\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify if he felt Biden should be investigated by Congress, Scott replied, \u201cI think we just get the facts out.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans were hardly dying for more facts on the particulars of Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis was vetted by the [Director of National Intelligence] and the Office of Legal Counsel,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. \u201cAnd they said, this does not rise to the level where Congress should have access to this information. There is a reason we have executive privilege.\u201d\n\nJohnson instead suggested the press spend its time asking questions about Biden. \u201cI agree that you should be asking what exactly happened in Ukraine,\u201d said Johnson, \u201cwith Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden. What was happening there? That\u2019s some question you guys should be asking.\u201d\n\nIt was left to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT)\u2014perhaps the only Republican senator willing to publicly cross Trump on such matters\u2014to advance the modest suggestion that Congress should have access to a transcript of the president\u2019s conversation with Zelensky and to hear directly from the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cThe allegations that have been made through the media, from whatever sources the media has, are very serious,\u201d said Romney. \u201cAnd to determine exactly what happened, it would be very helpful to receive the facts through the transcript of the conversation the president had, and I presume, also a discussion with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nStill, Romney declined to say if he was concerned by Trump\u2019s public admission of discussing Biden with Zelensky. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to mention someone's name, it's another thing to say, would you please carry out an investigation of this person and behalf of my campaign?\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral of his colleagues, however, quickly threw cold water on the idea of obtaining that transcript, or obtaining the whistleblower\u2019s complaint\u2014document Democrats are seeking through a subpoena.\n\n\u201cNo, this is not something Congress necessarily has to have its hands on,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThere's a reason these conversations between world leaders are kept confidential.\u201d\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-OH) said that revealing those details would set a precedent that \u201cmakes it tough to have a confidential conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would think if they could release the transcript that would answer a lot of questions,\u201d said Portman, adding that the White House could seek the OK from Ukrainian officials to release the transcript.\n\nGOP leadership does not seem interested in avoiding the issue entirely. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Monday that he wanted the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, as well as the intelligence community Inspector General Michael K. Atkinson, to brief the Senate Intelligence Committee this week on the matter.\n\n\"I believe it's extremely important that their work be handled in a secure setting\u2026 based on facts, rather than leaks to the press,\u201d said McConnell, adding that he felt it \u201cregrettable\u201d that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff chose to \u201cpoliticize\u201d the issue, omitting that the whistleblower has been trying to pursue the complaint through the proper channels.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a political matter,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), formerly McConnell\u2019s deputy, to the press later that day. \u201cThis is a matter of congressional oversight responsibilities.\u201d\n\nCornyn was asked by a reporter if Trump requesting political help from a foreign leader made it a political matter, but the elevator taking him to the Senate floor closed.", "description": "LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569286244/190923-brodey-trump-tease_rhvj3t", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
