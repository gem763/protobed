The government curbed the internet temporarily in response.\n\nSecurity forces said the most deadly incident, during which 33 people were killed in the town of Wamena on Sept. 23, was triggered by a hoax about racial slurs made against students by a teacher.\n\nA former Dutch colony, Papua was formally incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, after a disputed vote of about 1,025 hand-picked tribal leaders. The result of the plebiscite was overseen and endorsed by the United Nations.\n\n(Reporting by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has completed the last leg of a 13,000-km (8,080 mile) fiber-optic network that will bring high-speed internet to some of its poorest regions in the country's east, including the restive region of Papua, the government said on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
