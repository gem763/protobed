The companies had argued they should be based on income from only their telecoms business, but the court said they must be based on the amount earned from all business dealings such as from handset sales and other income.\n\n\u201cThis decision has come at a time when the sector is facing severe financial stress and may further weaken the viability of the sector as a whole,\u201d Airtel said in a statement.\n\nVodafone Idea said: \u201cWe urgently request that the government engage on this matter in order to find ways to mitigate the financial stress for the industry.\u201d\n\nHowever, Reliance Jio, the mobile operator backed by Ambani and which turned the sector on its head in 2016 with free calls and ultra-cheap data, escaped with a relatively light $1.8 billion tab.\n\nMany players have exited the sector in recent years or have gone bankrupt trying to compete with Jio.\n\n\u201cIt is an unfair blow to existing telecom operators \u2014 Airtel and VodaIdea,\u201d Baburajan K, editor of TelecomLead.com told AFP.\n\n\u201cReliance Jio will definitely have an advantage in the upcoming quarters,\u201d Baburajan added.", "description": "Mumbai (AFP) \u2013 India\u2019s beleaguered telecom companies were dealt a blow on Friday after being told to pay a whopping $13-billion bill, though", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/600c5f_reliance-jio-is-expected-big-winner-court-ruling-india-pressure-telecom-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
