It\u2019s more like personal like that,\u201d Mr Ludvigsson said.\n\nThe two men were in stable condition in a hospital in the mainland city of Mackay today.\n\nDanny Maggs, 22, had cuts on his right calf. Alistair Raddon, 28, lost his right foot.\n\nRELATED: British tourist yelled \u2018shark, shark\u2019 as he was bitten in the Whitsundays\n\nThe two men issued a joint statement thanking everyone involved in their care and their friends and family back home for their support.\n\nThe Swedish nurses also joked the pair were annoyed at having to skip the rest of their Aussie holiday.\n\nMany have said they owe their lives to Ms Andersson and Mr Ludvigsson.\n\n\u201cWe were up on the boat when we heard screams, we did not understand what we were hearing at first,\u201d Mr Ludvigsson said.\n\nAs the two men were pulled back onto the boat, the nurses switched from holiday mode and immediately began to administer first aid.\n\n\u201cWe saw how badly he was badly injured, he was missing a foot. We had to make a makeshift tourniquet with ropes and towels to stop the bleeding,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Raddon\u2019s bleeding was so severe, the paramedic feared he would not make it back to shore alive.\n\n\u201cI think we might have actually have saved his life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe was bleeding so badly and it was a long boat ride back to shore \u2014 if he continued to bleed that much all the way, I\u2019m not sure he would have made it.\u201d\n\nThe paramedics said the Brits stayed positive during the ordeal, complaining that the attack would ruin their holiday.\n\n\u201cThey were pissed (annoyed) actually, they were going to do something else today that they did not want to miss,\u201d Ms Andersson said.\n\nIt is the fifth attack in the area since last September, with Tourism Whitsunday saying visitor numbers have slipped.\n\n\u201cWe would ask the federal and Queensland governments for support to provide immediate funding for daily aerial surveillance in specific bays as an interim measure,\u201d chief executive Tash Wheeler said.\n\nWhatever preventive measures are taken, it won\u2019t be enough for the Swedish medics.\n\nAsked if they would dip a toe into the north Queensland waters before they return home on Friday, their answer was definitive.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s too soon,\u201d Ms Andersson said.", "description": "Two Swedish nurses say they used towels and rope to stop the bleeding from two British men\u2019s injuries in a shark attack on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e2a6e9a1c9a1fe4f0b5a399656e6f372?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
