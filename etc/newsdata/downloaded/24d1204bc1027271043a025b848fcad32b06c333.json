For the first time I'll be down in Melbourne covering that as well, and as a result I'll be leaving Sydney a little early.\n\nBut rather than fly down, I'll be taking the train. A group of Australians are replicating the Train Jam from the United States, aiming to have a game finished in the time it takes to train down from Brisbane to Melbourne. I'll be joining the trip halfway through, and it'll be a fun opportunity to chat to developers on the way, see how the XPT train handles everyone's oversized Apple chargers, and just have a chance to talk to people about their experiences.\n\nIt'll be fun! Beyond that, I'll probably have a last shot at [insert embargoed game here because I'm not allowed to talk about it] and, if it ever bloody loads, Destiny 2.\n\nWhat are you playing this weekend?", "description": "I'll be spending a lot of time around games this weekend, but not quite in the usual sense.", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Stephen Totilo"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2015/09/ss_d3e9524654b9a21f2a9f7cb11865d895485d90951.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
