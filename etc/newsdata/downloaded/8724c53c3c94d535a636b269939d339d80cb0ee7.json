(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nAn umbrella group for D.C. police unions rented out President Trump\u2019s hotel for its annual holiday party \u2014 and now faces sharp criticism from some of its own members, who object to the high cost and the forced association with the Trump brand.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police lodge for the District, which advocates and organizes social events for 11,000 local law enforcement officers, reserved Trump International Hotel for a night in early December. \u201cA night of celebration surrounded by elegance,\u201d the lodge said. Tickets cost $175 per couple, plus $200 more if you wanted a room for overnight.\n\nBut leaders of three individual police unions \u2014 who are affiliated with the lodge but have separate leadership \u2014 all said they were put off by the selection of the Trump hotel.\n\nThe three leaders represent the U.S. Park Police, U.S. Capitol Police and officers at the District\u2019s juvenile correctional facilities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are, quite frankly, furious about it,\u201d said Michael Shalton, chairman of the Park Police union.\n\nWithin his department, Shalton said that many officers were still unhappy with Trump because of his role in last winter\u2019s government shutdown. Many Park Police officers were declared \u201cessential\u201d employees and were required to work without pay.\n\n\u201cWe went six weeks without a paycheck because of this administration, and you want us to have a Christmas party there? Come on. There\u2019s a lot of bad blood,\u201d Shalton said.\n\nShalton, citing the expense, said he would not attend.\n\n\u201cWho can afford to drop nearly $400 three weeks before Christmas?\u201d Shalton said. \u201cI know I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor the past 10 years, the D.C. lodge\u2019s holiday party has been held at the lodge itself, a drab building near D.C. Superior Court. That was less elegant than Trump\u2019s soaring hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. But it was also cheaper: Last year, tickets to the event were just $35.\n\nRobert Berretta, the lodge president, did not respond to questions about why the venue was changed this year. Union leaders interviewed for this story said Berretta told them at a meeting that it wasn\u2019t political; they\u2019d looked at other sites but Trump\u2019s hotel gave them the best deal.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNationally, police support for Trump is strong. The National Fraternal Order of Police, which says it is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, with more than 330,000 members,\u201d endorsed Trump for election in 2016. The International Union of Police Associations has already endorsed Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nTrump has nominated the former national FOP president, Chuck Canterbury, to be the next head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\n\u201cI would say at least 80 percent of our membership nationwide is solidly supportive of President Trump,\u201d said Jim Pasco, executive director of the national FOP. Pasco said the Democratic Party, \u201cwhich under [President] Clinton had been the \u2018law and order party,\u2019 has more or less ceded that mantle back to the Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn other parts of the country, police-related groups have become reliable customers for Trump\u2019s businesses \u2014 even as other customers have turned away. At Trump\u2019s Doral resort outside Miami, the Miami New Times found three major police galas had been held recently.\n\nBut in Washington, some union leaders said the Trump name would drive some of their members away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure a lot of our officers probably aren\u2019t going to go. I\u2019d be shocked if anybody goes,\u201d said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the union for U.S. Capitol Police Officers.\n\nHe said some officers were Trump supporters, but others weren\u2019t \u2014 and others would stay home simply to avoid any association with politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d Papathanasiou said, \u201cbecause, number one, the cost is an issue. And I don\u2019t want to be mixed in with today\u2019s political atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAt the union that represents D.C.\u2019s youth correctional officers, chairman Andre Phillips said his members were stunned by the choice. He estimated that 98 percent of them are black, and many work closely with youths from low-income parts of the District.\n\nHe said that his members were strongly opposed to Trump\u2019s politics, believing that the president has made life worse for the people they serve.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sell this to our people,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWhy should we have to align ourselves with that individual \u2014 with the president \u2014 when all our political views are different?\u201d\n\nAt the union for D.C. police, the largest in the city, chairman Stephen Bigelow Jr. declined to comment \u2014 other than to say some of his members won\u2019t attend because of the location.\n\nOn one private Facebook page for D.C. police officers viewed by The Washington Post, officers were more outspoken. They mocked the choice by posting Internet memes. \u201cI would rather die!\u201d one wrote, over an indignant GIF of comedian Kevin Hart. Another posted a parody video of a man singing a song called \u201cHell to The Naw, Naw, Naw.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly time I\u2019m going there is when I\u2019m getting paid,\u201d another officer wrote.\n\nOne member of the group did find something nice to say about Trump\u2019s hotel.\n\n\u201cOne thing we can all agree on is that he has the most clutch bathroom downtown,\u201d for the officers working during anti-Trump protests, the member wrote.\n\nTom Jackman contributed to this story.", "description": "Some officers object to the high cost, and the president\u2019s role in last winter\u2019s shutdown. \u201cWe went six weeks without a paycheck because of this administration, and you want us to have a Christmas party there?\u2019", "authors": ["David A.
