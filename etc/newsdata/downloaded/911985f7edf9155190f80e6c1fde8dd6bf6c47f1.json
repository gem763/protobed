In May, months after concluding a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump threatened to hit Mexico with new tariffs to curb migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. He has also threatened to impose tariffs on Europe.\n\n\u201cThe rise in [trade policy uncertainty] in 2018 and 2019 has gone hand in hand with a slowdown in world industrial production and global grade,\u201d said the research, which was posted online Wednesday by the Fed\u2019s board of governors.\n\nEconomists documented the rise in trade-policy uncertainty with separate text analyses of newspaper articles and corporate-earnings calls. They examined the monthly share of newspaper articles discussing trade-policy uncertainty by doing a text analysis of news stories that included terms related to uncertainty, such as \u201crisk,\u201d \u201cthreat,\u201d and \u201cuncertainty,\u201d in addition to terms related to trade-policy uncertainty, such as \u201ctariff,\u201d \u201cimport duty,\u201d and \u201canti-dumping.\u201d\n\nThey then compared increases in these measures of trade-policy uncertainty with movements in industrial output and other financial and economic variables to estimate the effect on gross domestic product in the U.S., in other developed foreign economies and in emerging market economies.\n\nThe researchers found that an initial increase in trade-policy uncertainty in the first half of 2018 shaved around 0.8% from U.S. and global economic output in the first half of 2019. They further calculated that more recent increases in uncertainty will now reduce U.S. output by more than 1% in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe drag on gross domestic product would have begun to ease \u201chad trade tensions not escalated again in May and June 2019,\u201d the economists said. \u201cHowever, renewed uncertainty since May of 2019 points to additional knock-on effects that may push down GDP further in the second half of 2019 and in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe increase in trade-policy uncertainty has posed a challenge for Fed policy makers, who shifted from raising rates last year to cutting them this year.\n\nThere are \u201cno recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation,\u201c Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech last month. \u201dMonetary policy is a powerful tool \u201c to support the economy, but \u201dit cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump has criticized the central bank for raising interest rates last year and for not lowering them more aggressively this year, and he has sought to pre-emptively blame the central bank for any downturn.\n\nRelated Video Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is facing fears of an economic downturn, volatile markets and criticism from President Trump.

The latest research illustrates how many economists and Fed officials, however, are increasingly concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s mercurial trade tactics\u2014not only the use of tariffs but also the capricious way in which they are announced, sometimes surprising even his own advisers\u2014could cause lasting damage to the economy.\n\nMr. Trump has said tariffs are an important negotiating tactic to achieve a more comprehensive trade agreement, but such an agreement looks less likely now than it was earlier this year, despite an increase in tariffs.\n\nThe six Fed economists who conducted the research noted that there is some degree of uncertainty around their specific estimates. Still, they conclude that the evidence suggests \u201cthat higher trade policy uncertainty has adverse effects on GDP and investment, with these effects estimated to be protracted through time.\u201d\n\nThe research complements other recent analyses. \u201cThe prominent role of trade policy in recent U.S. stock market swings is historically unprecedented,\u201d said Steven Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, in a paper published last month.\n\nDrawing on newspaper-based measures of trade-policy uncertainty, Mr. Davis concluded that trade-policy uncertainty since early 2018 is \u201can extraordinary departure from recent history.\u201d Mr. Davis\u2019s analysis of economic literature concluded that more predictable policy yields better economic performance, while greater policy uncertainty is more harmful.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "Uncertainty over trade policy is likely to reduce\u00a0U.S. economic output by more than 1%\u00a0through early 2020, Federal Reserve research suggests.", "authors": ["Nick Timiraos", "Nick.Timiraos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104259/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
