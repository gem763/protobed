A downside is that stainless steel conducts heat poorly. Metals like aluminum and copper deliver much better thermal conductivity. Unfortunately, these metals are softer and reactive with acidic ingredients, thus possibly leaching into foods and causing health issues. On top of that, they are high-maintenance.\n\nCladding offers the best of all worlds by fusing together layers of different metals to harness their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses. With clad stainless steel cookware, copper and aluminum serve as heat conductors when bonded between layers of stainless steel. And the external stainless steel layers make the cookware stronger and sturdier overall.\n\nFully clad stainless steel cookware is built with these layers of metals throughout each piece's body \u2014 along the bottom and up the sidewalls to the rim. In contrast, bottom-clad ones are layered only at the base. Cooking with bottom-clad stainless steel pots and pans is perfectly fine, but their stainless-steel-only walls don't spread and retain heat well.\n\nKate Williams \u2014 formerly of America's Test Kitchen and current editor-in-chief of Southern Kitchen\u2014 explained, \"When you're cooking anything that is going to need some even heat from your pot or pan's sides, such as a thick braise or a custard, you'll want to pull out fully-clad cookware. [Recipes to be cooked] over low heat will also turn out best cooked in such a vessel; the increased insulation from the multiple layers of metal will help [\u2026] maintain an even temperature.\"\n\nAlas, fully clad stainless steel cookware can be expensive. When researching these cookware sets, you should consider factors that affect performance and price, like the following:\n\nPly or number of layers in cladding: Tri-ply cladding has three layers (such as aluminum sandwiched between two layers of stainless steel) while five-ply has five fused layers (for example, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, aluminum, stainless steel). Five-ply cladding, which conducts and retains heat better, is sturdier and more resistant to warping, but more expensive, slower to heat up, and according to the cooking pros we consulted for this guide, not necessarily crucial for better cooking. Seven-ply cladding is available in very high-end models as well.\n\nTri-ply cladding has three layers (such as aluminum sandwiched between two layers of stainless steel) while five-ply has five fused layers (for example, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, aluminum, stainless steel).

Thickness of sidewalls and overall weight: The thicker the walls, the better the thermal conductivity and insulation. A good test is to pick up a pot or pan and see how it feels \u2014 you want it to have a bit of heft. A heavier piece is more likely to have substantial cladding; a lightweight piece has thin cladding. Also, tap the bottom of the pot or pan: A low-quality piece emits a \"clang\" and a higher-quality piece produces a \"thud.\"\n\nThe thicker the walls, the better the thermal conductivity and insulation.

But if you have the desire to invest in more pieces, you'll have more flexibility to prepare a greater variety of recipes, either one at a time or simultaneously.\n\nWe interviewed a former prep cook and consulted culinary equipment sites that specifically focus on and test cooking equipment to explore fully clad stainless steel cookware sets.\n\nHere are our top picks for the best fully clad stainless steel cookware sets:", "description": "Fully clad stainless steel cookware heats ingredients more uniformly and retains heat more effectively while resisting warping.
