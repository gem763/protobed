It has taken 65 years for a human to make history in sport.\n\n'After Roger Bannister it took another 65 years \u2026 I'm happy to be the man to run under two hours.\n\n'No human is limited, and I'm expecting more people to do it after today.\n\nFormer athlete Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run a sub four-minute mile in 1954\n\nKipchoge was racing alone but was assisted by 41 pacemakers, including former Olympic and world record holders, in his attempt to achieve the milestone.\n\n'The 41 pacemakers are among the best athletes in the whole world \u2026 to all of them I want to say thank you, thank you for doing the job.
