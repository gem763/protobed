Fall is slowly creeping in, but you still have all that sand in your sheets and a peeling sunburn. Lucky, Mandy Moore is here with a new song to act as the perfect autumnal segue. \u201cWhen I Wasn\u2019t Watching,\u201d Moore\u2019s first new original song since her 2009 EP Amanda Leigh, sounds like orange and brown leaves falling directly into your pumpkin spiced latte. It also sounds like Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTime After Time,\u201d or at least the intro does, but after that, you\u2019re getting full-on Mandy. You don\u2019t have to take our word for it, of course.
