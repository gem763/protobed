Giuliani, for a politically driven investigation by Kiev into a potential campaign opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nAD\n\nHer recall and Trump\u2019s denunciation incensed Women Ambassadors Serving America (WASA), an organization of over 170 current and former U.S. envoys.\n\nAD\n\nCiting the White House memorandum of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Women Ambassadors\u2019 recent statement chided Trump for comments that \u201cdemean and threaten Ambassador Yovanovitch\u2026 despite her very strong record of speaking out clearly and firmly against corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nShe had already been recalled from Kiev in May, but that didn\u2019t stop Trump from \u201cdenigrating the Ambassador and stating that \u2018she\u2019s going to go through some things\u2019\u201d during the call, the statement complained.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s comment \u201csuggests that it might be an intention to punish the Ambassador for unspecified actions,\u201d the Women Ambassadors added. \u201cThis appears to be a threat of retaliation for political reasons, which is both shocking and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAnother former ambassador to Ukraine, Steven Pifer, described Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine for \u201cderogatory information\u201d on Biden as \u201can abuse of power.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPifer\u2019s email added this ominous prospect: \u201cI have seen nothing quite as blatant at this but have to wonder if there are other questions where the White House has subverted American interests to the President's.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the White House blocked the House appearance of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. The White House said the administration would not participate in the \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional inquiry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is Trump\u2019s State Department, however, that has played partisan politics. An August report by State\u2019s Office of Inspector General said \u201cnumerous employees\u201d protested that Assistant Secretary Kevin Moley and his former senior advisor Mari Stull praised or criticized staffers because of their \u201cperceived political views. For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the Department, Ms. Stull referred to them or to other career employees as \u2018Obama holdovers,\u2019 \u2018traitors,\u2019 or \u2018disloyal.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn one case, Stull accused an employee who had accompanied Congressional Black Caucus members to the United Nations, as is routine, of \u201ctrying to \u2018thwart\u2019 President Trump and undermine his agenda,\u201d the inspector general reported. \u201cAfter the trip, many of the employee\u2019s job responsibilities were taken away.\u201d\n\nIn a response included with the report, Moley said, \u201cI did not accuse any individual of undermining the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d Stull left the department and could not be reached for comment.\n\nAD\n\nThe inspector general said it could close its recommendation that department officials consider disciplinary action against Moley when State decides on what action, if any, it plans to take. The recommendation remains open.\n\nHolding military assistance to Kiev hostage to Trump\u2019s appeal for a politically driven investigation into a potential election opponent, as reflected in the Trump call with Zelensky, was another example of Trump\u2019s private interest eclipsing the national interest. Trump says there was not a quid pro quo and that his call was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, there is a growing belief among State\u2019s workforce, The Washington Post reported Monday, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u201chas subordinated its mission and abandoned colleagues in the service of President Trump\u2019s political aims.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBefore any of this, there was a sharp increase under Trump in political appointees taking positions that could be held by career staffers. About 45 percent of the ambassadors he has appointed are politicos, compared to just 30 percent under the Obama administration, according to the American Foreign Service Association, the union for Foreign Service Officers.\n\nExcept for the director general slot that by law must go to a FSO, \u201cthere is not a single career official who has been nominated to be assistant secretary of a bureau,\u201d said retired ambassador Laura Kennedy, who was among those signing the Women Ambassadors\u2019 statement. \u201cIt is unprecedented for the career public servants to be thus shut out of the policy level ranks of the State Department.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch is an important witness in the probe of the president\u2019s effort to use diplomacy as a personal campaign tool, an allegation he denies.", "authors": ["Joe Davidson", "Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pN27TUKbSbv81gBQeIyP5e3DnDY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3H5BZUXLWAI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
