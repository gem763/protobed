USA TODAY partnered with The Creative Coalition, Women in Film and Television, and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center to conduct the survey, which focused specifically on Hollywood.\n\nThe survey included 843 women who work in the entertainment industry in a variety of roles (producers, actors, writers, directors, editors and others) and asked about their experiences with sexual misconduct. Nearly all of respondents (94%) said they have experienced some form of harassment or assault, often by an older individual in a position of power over the accuser, and more than one-fifth of respondents (21%) said they have been forced to do something sexual at least once. Notably, the survey showed younger women with less than five years of experience in the industry are more likely to blow a whistle on misconduct, providing optimism for future change.\n\nLast year, women courageously began speaking out about sexual misconduct by men in Hollywood. To continue this movement in 2018 and beyond, USA TODAY\u2019s survey offers an in-depth look at the issue of sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. The results provide Hollywood with concrete numbers that can serve as measures of progress combatting it.\n\n\u201cIn the course of our reporting on the sexual harassment in Hollywood crisis, we kept hearing about A-list names who were affected. What we weren\u2019t hearing about were the everyday people in the industry struggling with these issues,\u201d said Alison Maxwell, managing editor of USA TODAY Life. \u201cBecause of this, we set out to quantify it with plain, hard facts. Now we know the extent of the problem, and hopefully we can help fix the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite simply, the survey opens a window that can no longer be shut. From the office, to the dorm room, to everyday life - sexual harassment, assault, and rape are an epidemic. The time for change is now,\u201d said Robin Bronk, CEO of The Creative Coalition. \u201cWith every new voice that speaks up, another person is empowered to tell their story. Another person calls out harassment. Another person becomes an ally in the fight against assault. We all must continue to speak up and demand change. We must maintain the momentum of this pivotal movement.\u201d\n\n\"These percentages are horrifying, but by no means surprising. From the most overt to the most insidious nuanced overtures, in front of the camera or behind the scenes, these results confirm what New York Women in Film & Television (NYWIFT) have heard from our members for decades,\u201d said Terry Lawler, Executive Director, New York Women in Film & Television. \u201cFinally having quantitative data confirm the qualitative knowledge is a significant step forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal and scope of the USA TODAY survey is one-of-a-kind in its focus on sexual harassment in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Laura Palumbo, communications director of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.\n\nThis survey is part of a broader initiative by the USA TODAY Life team to examine in depth the culture of sexual harassment in Hollywood. This three-part series will also focus on the experience of the accusers, micro-aggression within the workplace, changes that need to be made by those at the top, and how to create a safer work environment for those who work in the entertainment industry.
