And California? Forget it.\n\nMr. Simmons said his favorite fair is in Augusta, Ga., because he is basically uncensored. He doesn\u2019t work the big, national motorcycle rallies, though.\n\n\u201cMost of those are open carry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not dumb.\u201d\n\nWhite clowns can get in the most trouble, Mr. Simmons and Mr. Ortiz both said.\n\nIn 2014, a dunk tank clown at the Delta Fair in Memphis was fired when he used the term \u201cnappy head\u201d to insult a black woman and her family. Tanya Jones, the target of the clown\u2019s insults, told a local television station at the time that she was humiliated.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Style Insult-Clowns.Html"], "top_image": ""}
