The South Korean automaker says the name and the brackets are partly a reference to the 45-degree angles at the front and rear, \u201cforming a diamond-shaped silhouette that further foreshadows the design direction of future EV models.\u201d But they\u2019re also a reference to Hyundai\u2019s origins 45 years ago.\n\nMy first thought looking at the body shape and taillights was \u201cDeLorean DMC-12.\u201d But a more direct analog is the 1974 Pony Coupe, Hyundai\u2019s first mass-produced car and first export. The automaker is clearly trying to make a statement about its history and how that will gel with its intended future.\n\nThere are all sorts of futuristic accents on the 45 that aren\u2019t immediately obvious to the naked eye. At the bottom of the driver\u2019s side door, \u201ca special garnish\u201d of lights lets you know how much range you have left before you need to recharge the battery. The car uses cameras instead of side-view mirrors, and the interior is dominated by a dashboard-length screen that Hyundai claims can be controlled via \u201cprojection beam interface\u201d that \u201creplaces a single central touchscreen with a series of displays and functions integrated into the dashboard itself.\u201d\n\nThere are all sorts of futuristic accents on the 45\n\nThe interior also points to a possibly autonomous future. The generous width and flooring are meant to mimic a living room. The production version won\u2019t be autonomous, Hyundai said, but it wanted to preserve the opportunity to transform the 45 into a self-driving car if need be.\n\nDepending on if it ultimately goes into product, the 45 could be an interesting follow-up to Hyundai\u2019s first production EV, the Kona SUV, which hit dealerships in 2018. The automaker is also working on a prototype electric supercar using technology provided by Croatian firm Rimac.", "description": "Hyundai\u2019s all-electric concept car, unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show, is a retro-futuristic stunner that harkens back to the automaker\u2019s first foray into mass-produced vehicles over four decades ago.", "authors": ["Andrew J.
