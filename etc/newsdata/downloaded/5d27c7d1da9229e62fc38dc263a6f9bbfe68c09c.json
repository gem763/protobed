(Stephen B. Morton/AP)\n\nA good pass rush is vital in today\u2019s NFL. The teams ranked in the Top 10 for rushing the passer by the game charters at Pro Football Focus have a combined win-loss record of 22-8 straight up and 19-11 against the spread through three weeks. Teams in the bottom 10 at rushing the passer are 8-21-1 straight up and 10-20 against the spread.\n\nTeams with solid pass-blocking units are also faring well. The 10 highest-rated clubs in 2019 have a 21-9 record heading into Thursday night\u2019s game (17-13 against the spread), while those in the bottom 10 are just 11-18-1 straight up and 14-15-1 against the spread.\n\nThose numbers could come in handy when assessing this week\u2019s slate. Here is how we expect the Week 4 games to shake out, starting with two prime picks against the consensus point spreads (as of Thursday morning) from multiple sports books in Las Vegas.\n\n[Fantasy football start/sit Week 4: Get Jacoby Brissett and Demarcus Robinson into your lineup]\n\nMinnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears (-2\u00bd)\n\nPick: Minnesota Vikings +2\u00bd\n\nThe Bears\u2019 injury concerns include defensive end Akiem Hicks (knee), defensive end Bilal Nichols (broken hand), nose tackle Eddie Goldman (oblique), right tackle Bobby Massie (vertigo), kicker Eddy Pineiro (pinched nerve in his right knee) and wide receiver Taylor Gabriel (concussion). The loss of Massie shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. He allowed just one sack last year and should be replaced by journeyman Cornelius Lucas, who is on his fourth team in four years.\n\nAny downgrade to the offensive line, especially on short rest like Chicago is facing after a Monday night win, isn\u2019t good for quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. His passer rating drops from 105.3 in a clean pocket to 20.3 when facing pass pressure, per Pro Football Focus. An incomplete pass, by comparison, results in a 39.6 passer rating.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3)\n\nPick: Jacksonville Jaguars +3\n\nAfter you adjust for down, distance and opponent, the Broncos have one of the worst pass-blocking units in the league this year, per Football Outsiders. The Jaguars have the league\u2019s best pass rush, a ranking no doubt boosted after sacking Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota nine times for 55 yards in Thursday\u2019s upset win.\n\n***\n\nThe two games above represent our best plays of the week because our analysis shows the point spreads are the most divergent from what we expect to happen once the teams take the field. Below are picks for the other games on this week\u2019s schedule. However, trying to pick every single NFL game is something of a fool\u2019s errand. The house wins so often partly because bettors try to make too many plays when the odds aren\u2019t in their favor. Keep that in mind when evaluating the remaining games from the Week 4 slate.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles at Green Bay Packers (-4)\n\nPick: Green Bay Packers -4\n\nNew England Patriots (-7) at Buffalo Bills\n\nPick: New England Patriots -7\n\nKansas City Chiefs (-6\u00bd) at Detroit Lions\n\nPick: Kansas City Chiefs -6\u00bd\n\nCarolina Panthers at Houston Texans (-4\u00bd)\n\nPick: Carolina Panthers +4\u00bd\n\nOakland Raiders at Indianapolis Colts (-7)\n\nPick: Oakland Raiders +7\n\nTennessee Titans at Atlanta Falcons (-4)\n\nPick: Atlanta Falcons -4\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at Los Angeles Rams (-10\u00bd)\n\nPick: Tampa Bay Buccaneers +9\u00bd\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (-16) at Miami Dolphins\n\nPick: Los Angeles Chargers -16\n\nWashington Redskins at New York Giants (-3)\n\nPick: New York Giants -3\n\nCleveland Browns at Baltimore Ravens (-7)\n\nPick: Cleveland Browns +7\n\nSeattle Seahawks (-5) at Arizona Cardinals\n\nPick: Seattle Seahawks -5\n\nDallas Cowboys (-2\u00bd) at New Orleans Saints\n\nPick: Dallas Cowboys -2\u00bd\n\nCincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers (-4)\n\nPick: Cincinnati Bengals +4\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Dolphins could be the worst team in NFL history\n\nThe Browns could be in trouble\n\nFantasy football cheat sheet: Week 4 updates on Alshon Jeffery, T.Y.
