I think people in Japan might be excited about this game. Call it a hunch!\n\nToday is the first public date for the 2019 Tokyo Game Show. As soon as the general public started being let in, many attendees started to make a beeline to either the Sony booth or the Square Enix to play the upcoming FFVII Remake.\n\nAt around 9.40am, the end of the line at the Square Enix booth looked like this:\n\nSony had cut off the FFVII Remake line by 10am, along with several other titles. The red stickers say that the demo sessions have ended for the day.\n\n10am at the Sony booth @ the Tokyo Game Show pic.twitter.com/PPuUJyRhBQ \u2014 Brian Ashcraft (@Brian_Ashcraft) September 14, 2019\n\nSquare Enix, which had a significantly larger FFVII Remake set up with more demo stations, didn\u2019t cut off the line until to sometime around 10.10am or around thereafter.\n\nAt around 10:20am, Square Enix booth @ the Tokyo Game Show.

Square Enix passing out tickets for folks to come back later so they don\u2019t have to stand in line for extended periods of time.\n\nThis is me going out on a limb, but I think people in Japan are excited about FFVII Remake.", "description": "In what should surprise absolutely no one, Final Fantasy VII Remake is drawing long lines at the Tokyo Game Show.
