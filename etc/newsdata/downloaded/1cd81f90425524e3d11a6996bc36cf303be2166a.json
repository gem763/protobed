I wasn\u2019t as shocked at hearing the word \u2018cancer\u2019 as I might have been.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d caught it early. The oncologist told me I had two options. One was surgery to remove my prostate.\n\n\"The other was a course of radiation and chemotherapy that meant I would have to go back to hospital dozens of times. I went straight for the surgery.\u201d\n\nThe surgery was deemed a success but Elton found he had problems days later.\n\nHe continued: \"It wasn\u2019t until I arrived in Las Vegas ten days later for a gig at Caesars Palace that I noticed something wasn\u2019t right. As the day progressed, the pain got worse and worse.\n\n\"I\u2019ve worn some ridiculous things onstage in my time, but never a giant nappy.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever stood in front of 4,000 cheering fans, singing Candle In The Wind while literally p***ing yourself, but if you haven\u2019t, I can tell you for a fact it\u2019s quite an odd experience.\u201d\n\nElton, who is married to 56-year-old David Furnish, said that the problems were caused by his lymph nodes and doctors performed a colonoscopy to cure the issue.\n\nIt was the life-threatening disease months later that concerned Elton more, after he was hospitalised during a trip to South America.\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\nRecalling the tropical disease, Elton wrote: \"The doctors told David I was 24 hours away from death. If the South American tour had gone on for another day that would have been it: brown bread.\n\n\"So I was incredibly lucky \u2014 although, I have to say, I didn\u2019t feel terribly lucky at the time. I lay awake all night, wondering if I was going to die.\u201d\n\nElton was in hospital for eleven days and then had seven weeks of recovery, with Elton admitting that he prayed for his survival during that time.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
