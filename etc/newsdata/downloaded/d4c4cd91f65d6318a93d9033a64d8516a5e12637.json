REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nKolbe scored twice against Italy but picked up an injury and was kept out of the Springboks\u2019 final Pool B match against Canada as a precaution to ensure he was ready for the quarters.\n\nCoach Rassie Erasmus had rotated his squad through the pool stage to ensure his players all had game time before the knockout stage but has settled on the same matchday squad that played against Italy, with a 6-2 split between forwards and backs in the replacements.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys put up their hands and played really well and we wanted to get some continuity into the team,\u201d Erasmus told a media conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere were a few difficult selections but we felt given what we achieved against Italy and in the interests of combinations and continuity this was the best team to pick.\u201d\n\nErasmus said the 6-2 split on the bench was not an indication they would try to simply dominate the smaller Japanese forwards.\n\n\u201cThe way Japan play is that they do exploit your tired and bigger forward defenders late in the first and second half so we think with our selection, two fresh forwards might nullify that space they want to use,\u201d Erasmus said.\n\nHe added that the selection of Bongi Mbonambi as the starting hooker with Malcom Marx coming off the bench was due to the pace that they expected Japan to play.\n\nMbonambi was better suited for a tighter role while Marx would be better \u201cwhen the game opened up\u201d, Erasmus said.\n\nCaptain Siya Kolisi will start his third match in succession, and play his fifth game at the tournament, after he returned from an injury-ravaged season in the Springboks\u2019 tournament opener against the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cWe will probably try and play the game at our pace and they will try and play at theirs,\u201d Erasmus said.\n\n\u201cIt will be a great tactical battle.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of expectations in a quarter-final and it\u2019s who handles the pressure the best.\u201d\n\nTeam: 15-Willie le Roux, 14-Cheslin Kolbe, 13-Lukhanyo Am, 12-Damian de Allende, 11-Makazole Mapimpi, 10-Handre Pollard, 9-Faf de Klerk, 8-Duane Vermeulen, 7-Pieter Steph du Toit, 6-Siya Kolisi (captain), 5-Loedwyk De Jager, 4-Eben Etzebeth, 3-Frans Malherbe, 2-Bongi Mbonambi, 1-Tendai Mtawarira.\n\nReplacements: 16-Malcom Marx, 17-Steven Kitshoff, 18-Vincent Koch, 19-RG Snyman, 20-Franco Mostert, 21-Francois Louw, 22-Herschel Jantjies, 23-Frans Steyn.", "description": "South Africa's Cheslin Kolbe has returned from an ankle injury to be named in the starting side for Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against hosts Japan.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441796822&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0LA-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
