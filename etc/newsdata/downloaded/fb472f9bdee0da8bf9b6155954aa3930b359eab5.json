But each app must ensure they actually turn it on, or they will just look as they always do.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It means that users scrolling through their otherwise dark phone can open Instagram and be suddenly hit by a blazing light white design, which can be especially painful when scrolling at night.\n\nTwitter is full of users requesting that Instagram finally add the feature, comparing opening Instagram to having the curtains pulled open after sitting in the dark.\n\nNow Instagram appears to be finally testing it out, giving some people access to a dark mode that will automatically switch on if a phone has the setting turned on in their phone's options.\n\nThe dark mode appears to leave the rest of the design largely similar. The colours of the app remain unchanged, and photographs look no different; Instagram's dark mode simply swaps the bright white that is usually behind posts and stories and swaps it for a much darker colour.\n\nTo get the update, users need to be on the latest version of iOS and Android as wel as the latest version of Instagram, as well as having the dark mode option chosen in the system's settings. But not everyone in that position appears to be able to get access to it, with the test rolling out gradually.", "description": "Instagram is finally bringing a dark mode, one of the app's most requested features.
