'I am 18-years-old...'\n\nAt this point, the woman got out of her Jeep to insult the pair face-to-face.\n\n'Move! Go back to your country! Do whatever it takes!' she demands.\n\n'Excuse me!?' came the startled response from the teens.\n\nAs the woman appeared to be getting back inside the car she came back around and attacked the pair at which point the recording stops.\n\nThe video was posted to Twitter with the caption: 'Twitter do your thing... let\u2019s find this racist Trumpster. Unbelievable!'\n\nHundreds of people have since responded to the interaction.\n\nShe wasn't interested in hearing any excuses from the teens about why they had passed her\n\n'Omg! The anger and hate is unbelievable!' wrote one user. 'People who slap recording phones out of peoples hands are such idiots. Clear proof of assault,' said another.\n\nA number of Twitter users related the woman's racist outburst to the current occupier of The White House.\n\n'This is what 45 has created: mean, hateful people who feel the freedom to treat people in all kinds of evil ways!!!!' they wrote.\n\n'They've been here the whole time, doing this the whole time, we just didn't have camera phones and social media to call them on it. Just anecdotes that people of color could share with each other at parties,' another responded.", "description": "A female driver in Texas ended\u00a0up going on a racist tirade after being overtaken by teens.
