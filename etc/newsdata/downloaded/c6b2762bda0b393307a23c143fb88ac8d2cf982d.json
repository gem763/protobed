Ramos Miranda\n\nA rainbow is seen as demonstrators protest against Chile's state economic model in Santiago, Chile October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean truck and taxi drivers brought gridlock to the capital\u2019s highways on Friday in a protest against high road tolls that added to a week of rowdy demonstrations over social inequality.\n\nProtests that started over a hike in public transport fares boiled into riots, arson and looting that have killed at least 16 people, injured hundreds, and caused millions of dollars of damage to businesses and infrastructure.\n\nOn Friday morning, traffic was snarled along some major access points to Santiago as tractor trailer trucks, cars and taxis slowed to a crawl, honking horns, waving Chilean flags and bearing signs of protest at toll rates.\n\n\u201cNo more tolls! Enough with the abuse!\u201d read bright yellow-and-red signs plastered to the front of large trucks.\n\nChile\u2019s unrest is the latest in a flare-up of protests in South America and round the world - from Beirut to Barcelona - each with local triggers but also sharing underlying anger at social disparities and ruling elites.\n\nChileans on social media, meanwhile, were planning \u201cThe Largest March in Chile\u201d later on Friday, with rallies expected to paralyse major cities.\n\n\u201cThese protests were necessary,\u201d said street vendor Sergio Perez as he prepared a fruit stand. \u201cBut they\u2019ve made everything difficult, especially getting around.\u201d\n\nThe streets of downtown Santiago were littered with trash and broken glass and reeked of tear gas early on Friday from the latest marches and clashes. Downtown traffic was light as many businesses and schools remained close.\n\nVandals set fire to underground transport trains and stops last weekend, sowing $300 million in damage and hobbling public transportation.\n\nSTATE OF EMERGENCY\n\nChile\u2019s military has since taken over security in Santiago, a city of 6 million now under a state of emergency with night-time curfews.\n\n\u201cI used to take one bus to get to work, now I have to take four. This must stop,\u201d said Julio Herrera, 71, as he waited at a bus stop on his morning commute.\n\nPresident Sebastian Pinera, a billionaire businessman, told the nation on Thursday he had heard \u201cloud and clear\u201d the demands of Chileans. He said he would send a bill to Congress on Friday to boost pensions by 20% for the elderly.\n\nOn Thursday, he sent lawmakers legislation to overturn a recent hike in electricity rates, among several measures he said he hopes will turn the protests into an \u201copportunity\u201d.\n\nProsecutors said on Thursday that since Wednesday night 734 more people had been charged in connection with protests, looting and arson nationwide, with 324 taken into custody in Santiago. More than 7,000 have been charged since Saturday.\n\nA demonstrator gestures during a protest against social inequality in Concepcion, Chile, October 23, 2019.

The Chilean government said it would welcome a U.N. delegation, along with representatives of global NGO Human Rights Watch.\n\nForeign Minister Teodoro Ribera said there was \u201cno chance\u201d the government would call off two major global meetings in Santiago in coming months, including welcoming U.S President Donald Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.", "description": "Chilean truck and taxi drivers brought gridlock to the capital's highways on Friday in a protest against high road tolls that added to a week of rowdy demonstrations over social inequality.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Natalia A.
