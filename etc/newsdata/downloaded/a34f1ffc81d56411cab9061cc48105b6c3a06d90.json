(AP Photo)\n\nWhen Season 4 of ABC\u2019s \u201cScandal\u201d premiered in 2014, viewers learned that Olivia Pope, the inimitable fixer played by Kerry Washington, was living under an alias. Her team of gladiators had all taken on new monikers, but Olivia\u2019s \u2014 Julia Baker \u2014 held a deeper significance.\n\nJulia Baker is the character Diahann Carroll played on the groundbreaking sitcom \u201cJulia,\u201d which premiered in 1968 and ran for three seasons on NBC. The series \u2014 which starred Carroll as a registered nurse raising her young son alone following the death of her husband in Vietnam \u2014 was the first to star an African American woman in a professional role and not the stereotypical servile characters to which black women had been relegated.\n\nCarroll, who died Friday after a battle with cancer, was seen as a forebear to Washington and her iconic role, which marked the first time in nearly four decades (since Teresa Graves starred in ABC\u2019s short-lived 1970s crime drama \u201cGet Christie Love!\u201d) that an African American woman was the lead of a prime-time network drama.\n\n[Diahann Carroll, Tony-winning and pathbreaking actress, dies at 84]\n\nBy the time Carroll began playing Julia Baker in 1968, she had already become the first black woman to win a Tony (for the musical \u201cNo Strings\u201d) and had starred in several films including \u201cPorgy and Bess.\u201d But in her early days at NBC, the Harlem native encountered a stark reminder of her groundbreaking status. In a 2014 episode of PBS\u2019s \u201cPioneers of Television,\u201d Carroll recalled that NBC\u2019s makeup department did not have makeup for an actress of her complexion.\n\n\u201cThe studio had only dealt with the little American girls or European girls,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHow could you have a makeup department and you don\u2019t have makeup for every skin in the United States of America?\u201d\n\nJust two years earlier, NBC had struggled to find a national sponsor for a star-studded variety program hosted by crooner Nat King Cole, who later remarked that \u201cMadison Avenue is afraid of the dark.\u201d \u201cJulia\u201d defied expectations \u2014 landing in the Nielsen Top 10 in its first season \u2014 and led to a series of accolades for Carroll, who in 1969 became the first African American to win a Golden Globe \u2014 and the first African American woman to receive an Emmy nomination.\n\nBut the show was controversial amid the racial unrest that followed the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. An Ebony article that year noted that \u201cfor all its merits as a television \u2018first,\u2019 \" the sitcom had drawn criticism \u201cfor not projecting a male head-of-the-family image\u201d and \u201cfor showing Julia and [her] son leading a happily integrated life among middle class whites.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever Julia is presented, she represents another and more realistic evolution purely because of the circumstances of her existence,\u201d Carroll told the magazine. \u201cShe has her faults, but Julia is still quite special in that she\u2019s bright and curious. I identify very much with Julia.\u201d\n\nAnd the role would have implications for future generations, Carroll told Ebony. \u201cBlack children are going to have a marvelous time now. Their self-image is going to be so much greater.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cPioneers of Television,\u201d Carroll recalled that in 1968, several years ahead of Norman Lear\u2019s socially conscious sitcom slate, television shows were wary of addressing race. \u201cIt was absolutely \u2018let\u2019s stay away from that, that is too controversial,\u2019 so we knew that going in,\u201d Carroll said on PBS. \u201cThat first you make the success \u2014 after you\u2019ve done that, you can make other steps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was nothing like this young successful mother on the air,\u201d she added. \u201cWe thought that it might be a very good stepping stone.\u201d\n\n[A starlet of the civil rights era, Diahann Carroll looks back on a career of firsts]\n\nAfter \u201cJulia\u201d went off the air in 1971, Carroll returned to the stage and the big screen, which landed her an Oscar nomination (for \u201cClaudine\u201d) in 1975. Nine years later, as Carroll prepared to take on the role of a glamorous businesswoman in the iconic prime-time soap \u201cDynasty,\u201d she set her sights on another first: \u201cI want to be the first black b---- on television,\u201d she told People magazine.\n\nHer character, Dominique Deveraux, was shrouded in mystery when she joined \u201cDynasty\u201d in its fourth season. Carroll had sought out the role after falling in love with the soap. \u201cI thought, \u2018If this isn\u2019t the biggest hoot I\u2019ve ever seen, and the world is loving it,' \u201d she said in a 1998 interview with the Television Academy Foundation. \u201cEveryone was elegant, everyone was rich, everyone was traveling all over the world, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do. That\u2019s what I need to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCarroll reached out to Aaron Spelling and suggested to one of the producer\u2019s colleagues that \u201cDynasty\u201d \u2014 which had dealt, however controversially, with homosexuality and other hot-button issues \u2014 had tackled just about everything except racial integration. To do that, they first had to integrate the cast.\n\n[\u2018Scandal\u2019 is over, but here are 10 things we\u2019ll remember from this crazy show]\n\nBut nothing happened until Barbra Streisand invited Carroll to sing a song from \u201cYentl\u201d at the 1983 Golden Globe Awards. Knowing Spelling would be there, she dressed the part. After the ceremony, Carroll went to the private Los Angeles nightclub where Spelling and his colleagues were celebrating. Spelling later told People that after seeing Carroll, he and \u201cDynasty\u201d co-creator Esther Shapiro \u201clooked at each other and said, 'My God, she is \u2018Dynasty.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen Carroll came on board, she had one mandate for the show\u2019s writers: \u201cDon\u2019t try to write for who you think I am \u2014 write for a white man who wants to be wealthy and powerful.\u201d\n\nSpoiler alert: Dominique Deveraux turned out to be the surprise half-sister of oil baron Blake Carrington. The role led to epic showdowns with Blake\u2019s vindictive ex-wife, Alexis (Joan Collins).\n\nAs news of Carroll\u2019s death spread Friday, her impact could be seen in social media posts from prominent black women in entertainment.\n\n\u201cThanks for helping clear the path for me and so many others,\u201d Oprah Winfrey wrote.\n\nFilmmaker Ava DuVernay tweeted that Carroll \u201cblazed trails through dense forests and elegantly left diamonds along the path for the rest of us to follow.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiahann Carroll you taught us so much,\u201d wrote Debbie Allen, who directed the actress in her recurring role as Whitley Gilbert\u2019s mother on \u201cA Different World.\u201d \u201cWe are stronger, more beautiful and risk takers because of you,\u201d Allen added. \u201cWe will forever sing your praises and speak your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you for eternity. With all my heart. I am because of you,\u201d Washington wrote.", "description": "Kerry Washington, Ava DuVernay and Oprah Winfrey were among those remembering the pioneering \"Julia\" star, who died Friday at 84.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "October At Pm", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
