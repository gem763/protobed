Take Record Store Day\n\nThe organization dedicated to getting vinyl lovers into independent record stores just announced their list of exclusive and limited-run releases that can be snagged this Black Friday, November 29.\n\nRick Wojcik gets ready to play a special-edition vinyl record for his customers at the Dusty Groove music store in Chicago on April 13, 2019.\n\nThey're hopeful these new albums will get you into your corner record store instead of the mall. The group created Record Store Day Black Friday -- not to be confused with Record Store Day , which falls each April -- to push back against the corporate-retail gorging typically associated with the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"Traditionally, Black Friday was about super-cheap prices on mass-produced goods and primarily took place in mails and big box stores. In some places, that's what this is still about,\" the group says in an announcement on its website.\n\n\"Everything you find at a record store would be a great gift for someone, so being part of that holiday shopping season, and the biggest shopping day of the year, makes sense to us.\"\n\nWho's on the list\n\nFrom Paul McCartney, Pearl Jam and Phish, to Lizzo, Katy Perry and The Weeknd -- artists with Record Store Day's Black Friday releases span all genres and generations. Chances are there's a name for everyone on your list.\n\nHere are 10 vinyl releases we're excited to pick up. See the full list at recordstoreday.com\n\nPaul McCartney performs in 2017 at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in Tinley Park, Illinois.\n\nPearl Jam will release a 13,000-run LP of their 1992 MTV Unplugged concert in New York.\n\nPaul McCartney fans can score a special 7\" vinyl release of two songs: \"Home Tonight\" and \"In A Hurry.\"\n\nPhish is releasing a vinyl copy of the band's 1998 studio album \"Story of the Ghost,\" which captured some of the groovier, cow-funky sounds of that era.\n\nLizzo's debut solo EP, \"Coconut Oil,\" was released in October 2016. Now, fans can pick it up on vinyl as a part of a 5,500-copy press run.\n\nThe Jerry Garcia Band's appearance on March 1st, 1980, at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey, was immortalized in \"Garcia Live Volume One,\" a three-disc CD set released in 2013. Fans of the Grateful Dead legend's side project now can go further back in time with a vinyl release of the show -- a musical format that better fits the times.\n\nLizzo performs at Radio City Music Hall on September 24, 2019 in New York City.\n\nKaty Perry is giving fans a chance to pick up a limited-edition colored vinyl record featuring new music: the single \"Never Really Over\" and a new track, \"Small Talk.\"\n\nThe Dave Matthews Band will release a 4,000-run LP box set featuring songs from their September 10, 2018, concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. The appropriate title: \"Live At The Hollywood Bowl.\"\n\nWillie Nelson will release an ode to his beloved marijuana in the form of a 7\" vinyl exclusive album featuring the songs, \"Sometimes Even I Can Get Too High\" and \"It's All Going To Pot.\"\n\nNorah Jones is releasing new music featuring collaborations with gospel icon Mavis Staples and Tarriona \"Tank\" Ball of Tank & The Bangas.\n\nThe Weeknd's \"My Dear Melancholy,\" topped the Billboard charts when it was released in early 2018. It'll now be available on vinyl for the first time.\n\nHow to find exclusive releases\n\nThere are three categories of record releases: exclusives, RSD Firsts, and small run/regional. You can see them all here\n\nExclusives can only be found at independent retailers on Record Store Day -- or after, if you're lucky. RSD Firsts are releases that first appear at independent stores on Record Store Day and may later appear online and at larger, big-box retailers.\n\nThose labeled small run/regional are limited releases that may only be found in certain markets.\n\nNote the Black Friday version of Record Store Day is slightly different than the spring holiday. There are fewer record store-only exclusives, but still lots to be had. If you get your fill and want more, be sure to check the group's site for the next round of releases.", "description": "If you like vinyl and independent record stores, here's a look at which exclusive and limited-run releases can be snagged this Black Friday.", "authors": ["Brian Ries"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008144902-record-store-day-shuga-records-trnd-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
