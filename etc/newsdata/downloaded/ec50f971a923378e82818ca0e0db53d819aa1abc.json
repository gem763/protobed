They pulled over and stepped out of the car. The object was one or two stories tall and as wide as an airplane. It made no noise. It had a light that blinked like a pulse.\n\nJust then, another pair of lights appeared: headlights from an approaching car. Karen was momentarily distracted. When she looked up again, the object was gone. Her friend told her it had disappeared straight up into the sky.\n\nKaren remembers not being scared. As they drove away, she kept looking out the back window, hoping the thing would reappear. She wanted to see it again.\n\nThat\u2019s how Karen, who still lives in Wisconsin and has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for 27 years, ended up in the Nevada desert last week, one of at least 2,000 people to show up for a gathering inspired by a viral Facebook event advertising a raid of Area 51, the secretive U.S. military base known among conspiracy theorists and in popular culture as the place the government stashed alien spacecraft. (The Pentagon has acknowledged funding UFO research in general, but the U.S. government has said that Area 51 was a secret testing ground for aircraft built by humans.)\n\nThe visitors had come to test boundaries. More than 2 million people had RSVP\u2019d to the event, titled \u201cStorm Area 51, they can\u2019t stop all of us.\u201d The meme spread from Facebook to Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Discord and Twitter, morphing along the way. People joked about how they intended to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d The town of Rachel, Nev., which is near-ish to Area 51 but about 45 miles from the nearest gas station, braced for visitors.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t totally clear how much of the whole thing was a joke \u2014 an Internet meme that got stuck somewhere in the delicate membrane that separates the online world, with its anime-inspired advice for how to sprint in a way that helps you dodge bullets (head forward, arms pointed straight back, it\u2019s called \u201cNaruto running\u201d), and real life, where Area 51 is guarded by armed military officers who probably could stop as many people as they wanted to.\n\n[About those Area 51 conspiracy theories \u2026]\n\nWho were these people, and why had they come? Some came for the memes. Some came because they love the paranormal or were bored or wanted to sell stuff or some combination of those things. There were teen boys hawking alien T-shirts for gas money. Retired couples in RVs. A middle-aged woman with her five Australian shepherd dogs that had nosed their way into her cooler during the drive and eaten the salami. Two men with a burger truck who said they had seen a UFO on their drive from Austin. A pair of \u201cfurries\u201d (people who wear animal costumes) who spent the night in a wind-battered tent after losing track of their friends because of poor cell reception. A man in a space suit who said he had a million subscribers on YouTube. A dog in a tinfoil hat who said nothing. People in NASA T-shirts. People who insisted NASA was a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nAnd Karen Peterson, the Wisconsin postal worker with blue-green hair and some unfinished business.\n\nShe was here to test another boundary, between the present and the past. It had been 35 years since her encounter on that country road, and she was ready to reconnect with what she saw and felt as an awestruck teenager. She belonged to Facebook groups for people who believed they\u2019d seen UFOs, which is how she learned about the Area 51 \u201craid.\u201d It happened to coincide with her 53rd birthday, so she had persuaded her best friend, Margaret LeMay, who goes by Marge, to fly to Las Vegas and then rent a minivan and drive to the desert.\n\nWere they actually going to \u201cstorm\u201d a heavily guarded military base? Would she find out anything more about that gigantic, soundless, blinking object that had appeared to her as a teenager?\n\nHow real was any of this?\n\nKaren had come to see. But one thing remained the same, all these years later: She wasn\u2019t scared.\n\n\n\nMargaret LeMay and Karen Peterson of Wisconsin walk at a \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d spinoff event Friday in Rachel, Nev. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nRachel, Nev., is not exactly a town. It's a smattering of homes connected by gravel and dirt roads. There's a church that has seen better days and a junkyard. Fewer than 100 people live there. It's not wealthy, but it is beautiful, surrounded by distant mountains and canyons. At night, you can see the Milky Way. During the day, you can browse the alien-themed merchandise at the Little A'Le'Inn, which sells food and cheap beer and tchotchkes to seekers who come to visit the other nearby attractions, which are perpetually closed: a pair of gates, about 40 miles apart, that mark the approaches to Area 51.\n\nThese were the gates that the more cavalier of the Alienstock attendees were apparently meant to \u201cstorm\u201d in the early hours of Friday, Sept. 20. On Thursday, during the day, many of them went to scope out the back gate. Karen and Marge got a ride with a man who said he used to work at the base as a civilian.\n\nIt was obvious when they arrived that there would be no element of surprise. The scene at the back gate was merry, with law enforcement officers chatting with visitors and even helping to take pictures. A YouTuber interviewed Karen about her UFO story with a small smirk on his face. The man who gave Karen a ride chummed it up with the officers.\n\n[\u2018Storm Area 51\u2019 event is mostly peaceful, but still plenty weird]\n\nAccording to the original Facebook event, the raid was scheduled between 3 and 6 a.m. the next day, but details were scant. Much had changed since the first inklings of this oddball gathering had gone viral. The man who created the Facebook event, Matty Roberts, had disavowed the whole thing, worried about causing another Fyre Festival \u2014 the infamous 2017 gathering in the Bahamas that, due to a combination of social media hype and poor planning, had turned into a fiasco.\n\nUnlike Fyre Fest, the people who came to the Nevada desert didn\u2019t seem to expect much in the way of human comforts. Some seemed pleasantly surprised to find that there were porta-potties. Still, the prospect of any kind of coordinated overnight action at Area 51 faced organizational challenges. There was no clear leader, and Internet access in the desert was scarce. As night fell on Sept. 19, people huddled around the WiFi of the closed Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn as if it were a campfire. Plans were hatched the old-fashioned way: by word of mouth among strangers who were trying to orient themselves to this new, smaller group that they now belonged to: the ones who had shown up.\n\nKaren and Marge made friends with two other members of that group, Dan Ray and Michael Creber. Dan was a handsome man who made great eye contact and was open to the possibility that the Earth is flat. He said he worked part of the year as the first mate on a private yacht, ferrying wealthy people down the Eastern Seaboard, and otherwise lived in a blue van, ferrying himself around the country. His business card said \u201cAmerican refugee.\u201d Michael was a former Marine with an immaculate bright-blond mullet who said he had been researching UFOs for 20 years. His most important finding? \u201cThat they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\n[UFOs are suddenly a serious news story. You can thank the guy from Blink-182 for that.]\n\nMichael had a theory about what drew a lot of people to the desert. It wasn\u2019t just about manifesting Internet memes or freeing \u201cthem aliens.\u201d It also had to do with a different kind of freedom, the kind humans allow themselves. \u201cThe real reason for this,\u201d he said, grinning, \u201cis people want to party.\u201d\n\nAnd so they did. Michael and Dan and Karen and Marge became neighbors. The group of new friends parked their vehicles close together so they could protect one another from the wrong kinds of weirdos. (You can\u2019t be sure who might appear in the dark or whether they come in peace.) At night, they drank and laughed and shared ideas about the government and aliens and coverups and conspiracies.\n\nOn that night in 1984, Karen had told her parents about the two-story craft with pulsing lights. Her mom had laughed, but her father grew serious. He told her he believed her \u2014 that he, too, had seen a UFO once, in the 1950s, while he was a soldier stationed in Japan. He felt that he couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it at the time.\n\nShe had felt the same way about her own encounter until about a decade ago. Now, in the desert, Karen felt as comfortable speaking about it as ever. Everybody wanted to hear her story.\n\nHer father passed away in 2001. They hadn\u2019t talked about her experience much after the night it happened, but it made her feel uniquely connected to him \u2014 something she didn\u2019t take for granted as one of 11 children. Karen remembered telling her dad that what she\u2019d experienced was a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime thing.\u201d\n\nAnd she remembered his response: \u201cDon\u2019t bet on it.\u201d\n\n\n\nA sign greets motorists to Rachel, Nev. (Hannah Jewell/The Washington Post)\n\nEarly the next morning, while it was still dark, life-forms began to stir. Car lights blinked on. Whoops of laughter cut through the cold predawn air.\n\nAt the front gate, a pair of officers, one from the Nevada Department of Public Safety, the other from the Park Service, had spent the early hours greeting visitors as if they were trick-or-treaters. A few hundred feet away, on a hill, the headlights of an SUV pierced the dark. It belonged to the base\u2019s official military security personnel, known among tourists as the \u201ccamo dudes,\u201d who seemed to be monitoring things from afar.\n\nThe previous day, Karen had talked with young revelers about meeting at the front gate before dawn. She had meant to set her alarm for 2:30 a.m., but it didn\u2019t take, and she overslept. She finally arrived at the front gate with Marge and Dan as the sun was beginning to rise. They were the 28th, 29th and 30th visitors of the morning, according to the officers.\n\nWas this all there was to the raid? Had they missed it?\n\nYes and no. There had been a \u201craid\u201d \u2014 if you could call it that \u2014 at the back gate, according to the officers. A group of maybe 50 people showed up at once. Parts of the scene would appear later online. One video showed a setting that resembled a tailgate. Mostly it was a lot of guys standing around and chuckling and chanting lewd memes about alien lust while good-natured officers patiently watched.\n\nAnother video featured two men and a woman in silver bodysuits. \u201cWe\u2019re not here for photos. We\u2019re here to rescue the aliens!\u201d shouted one of the men, who was wearing blue face paint and sunglasses. The threesome lined up and Naruto-ran toward the gate, stopping short of the giant \u201cStop\u201d sign. (The officers standing guard didn\u2019t even bother to block their path.) Afterward, the woman twerked for the cameras.\n\nAt the front gate, as the dawn gathered behind them, Karen and Marge commemorated their own version of the Area 51 raid, taking photos to send to their children. Karen posed in an alien mask. Then she danced and laughed and cheered and shouted up to the camo dudes: \u201cFree them aliens!\u201d She yelled that it was her birthday and that she had come all the way from Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWe know what you\u2019re hiding in there!\u201d she shouted, joyously. \u201cCome on, free them! Woo! We\u2019re here to free the aliens!\u201d\n\nThe camo dudes did not reply.\n\n\u201cI thought there would be so many people!\u201d Karen said. \u201cThey\u2019re missing out. They\u2019re missing out.\u201d\n\nIt was an odd little postcard of a scene: Two middle-aged ladies from the Midwest and their new friend, Dan the American Refugee. They were far from 1984, far from the Internet, far from \u201cthey can\u2019t stop all of us\u201d and the burlesque that had unfolded at the back gate. But they were close to something \u2014 an experience, a feeling. She would remember this.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad I came,\u201d said Karen. \u201cThis a bucket-list place. I\u2019m so happy I came. This is the best birthday a girl could ever have.\u201d\n\nShe turned to taunt the camo dudes some more, then grew quieter for a moment.\n\n\u201cI just want to see aliens,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see them again.\u201d\n\nBut the gate wasn\u2019t going to open. Marge and Dan turned to leave. Karen lingered. The Earth had completed another rotation, and the sun bathed the desert in orange light. As celestial events go it was as routine as they come, but it was still a wonder. Karen was feeling grateful.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have seen the sunrise,\u201d she said, walking away from the gate, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for the aliens.\u201d", "description": "Memes, memories and a search for intelligent life in the Nevada desert.", "authors": ["Hannah Jewell", "Pop Culture Host For Washington Post Video", "September At Am", "Hannah Jewell Is The Pop Culture Host For The Washington Post", "Author Of", "Nasty Women Of History", "She Caused A Riot.", "She Joined The Post In"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_EYBe3oBrLfVj8H0OQZimthBAWg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ACCYKOW67II6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
