Mosley didn\u2019t name CBS Studios or \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d in the op-ed, but an individual with knowledge of the situation said he left the show of his own accord following a discussion with HR, but was not reprimanded.\n\n\u201cWe have the greatest admiration for Mr. Mosley\u2019s writing talents and were excited to have him join \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d CBS Studios said in a statement provided to TheWrap. \u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of confidential employee matters, we are committed to supporting a workplace where employees feel free to express concerns and where they feel comfortable performing their best work. We wish Mr. Mosley much continued success.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Snowfall' Cast, Producers Say 'Nothing Too Drastic' Will Change on FX Drama in the Wake of John Singleton's Death\n\nIn the op-ed, Mosley said that while he had used the word, \u201cI hadn\u2019t called anyone it. I just told a story\u2026 I was telling a true story as I remembered it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere I was, a black man in America who shares with millions of others the history of racism. And more often than not, treated as subhuman. If addressed at all that history had to be rendered in words my employers regarded as acceptable,\u201d Mosley wrote.\n\nMosley wrote also that he quit because \u201cI was in a writers\u2019 room trying to be creative while at the same time being surveilled by unknown critics who would snitch on me to a disembodied voice over the phone. My every word would be scrutinized. Sooner or later I\u2019d be fired or worse \u2014 silenced.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a time in America when so-called white people were uncomfortable to have a black person sitting next to them. There was a time when people felt uncomfortable when women demanded the right to vote. There was a time when sexual orientation had only one meaning and everything else was a crime,\u201d Mosley continued.\n\nAlso Read: Every Stephen King Movie, Ranked Worst to Best (Photos)\n\nConcluding by saying that \u201cThe worst thing you can do to citizens of a democratic nation is to silence them,\u201d Mosley urged readers not to \u201caccept the McCarthyism of secret condemnation.\u201d\n\nMosley, also a consulting producer and sometime writer on the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d is best known for his crime novels featuring the character Ezekiel \u201cEasy\u201d Rawlins. His 1990 novel \u201cDevil in a Blue Dress\u201d was adapted as a feature film starring Denzel Washington in 1995.\n\nRead original story Author Walter Mosley Quits \u2018Star Trek: Discovery\u2019 After CBS HR Called Him on Using N-Word in Writers Room At TheWrap", "description": "Novelist and screenwriter Walter Mosley has quit as a writer on the CBS All Access series \u201cStar Trek Discovery\u201d after disagreeing with the company\u2019s human resources department over his use of the n-word in the writers room, TheWrap has learned.Mosley, who is African American, said in a New York Times", "authors": ["Ross A.
