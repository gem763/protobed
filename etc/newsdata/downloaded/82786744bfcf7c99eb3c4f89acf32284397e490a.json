The tough measures, advocated by Mika Lintila, the Finnish finance minister, are gathering support from a number of other member states. Critics say that the administration in Brasilia is not doing enough to stop the fires, suspected of being started deliberately for commercial interest.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who had sought to blame NGOs for the blaze, withdrew from a regional meeting of the Latin American states to discuss the emergency, citing medical reasons.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The US president tweeted that \u201cfuture trade prospects\u201d between America and Brazil \u201care very exciting\u201d.\n\nThe UK, meanwhile, maintains that the EU threat not to sign a trade agreement with Brazil was an \u201cinappropriate\u201d response to the Amazon wildfires. But, with Brexit looming, London\u2019s position on the matter is viewed as largely irrelevant by other member countries.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Nordic state declared that climate action would be a \u201ckey priority\u201d when it took over the presidency of the European Council in July.\n\n\u201cSolving the climate crisis could be Europe\u2019s next heroic act, one that will be admired and praised by future generations,\u201d declared prime minister Antti Rinne.\n\nLast week\u2019s summit of EU foreign and defence ministers in Helsinki was the first one in which climate change was a major topic. Its effects on diplomatic and security issues were widely discussed and the subject will remain on the agenda in future meetings.\n\nAmong European leaders, Emmanuel Macron has been the foremost critic of the Brazilian government over the Amazon fires, and the relationship between him and Mr Bolsonaro has become increasingly toxic as a consequence, with a series of several very public clashes.\n\nThe verbal sparring between the two leaders was followed by a supporter on Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s Facebook page posting sexist insults about Mr Macron\u2019s 66-year-old wife, Brigitte, comparing her looks to that of the Brazilian president\u2019s wife Michelle \u2013 claiming that the French president was jealous. Mr Bolsonaro \u201cliked\u201d the post and wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t humiliate the guy... ha ha.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He threatened to strangle the French president, along with further abuse about Ms Macron\u2019s age and appearance. Mr Gracie also complained that tourism was declining because of the reports of the fires and insisted the burning of the rainforest was at \u201cnormal levels\u201d.\n\nFinnish government officials said they did not want to dignify the remarks of the Bolsonaro supporters by commenting on them.\n\nThe foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, of the Green Party, the only Green to hold that post in a western government, wanted to point out that while Mr Trump may have pulled out of the Paris climate pact, European Union members remain signatories.\n\nAnd the pact\u2019s impact on trade means that using the Mercosur trade agreement for pressure is entirely justified, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have responsibilities in our trade relations to take care of our environment and our climate ... we raised the matter at the ministers\u2019 meeting, we need strong EU action,\u201d he added.\n\nThe links between the environment and defence were also addressed at Helsinki, with a focus on how the militaries of European Union states can become more green.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign affairs commissioner, Federica Mogherini, said: \u201cWe discussed how to make sure that the militaries contribute to address climate change issues, in particular reducing the energy dependency and its carbon footprint and in this way contributing to address climate change effects.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the effect of climate change on conflicts that can affect the ways in which militaries could be deployed in these theatres.\n\n\u201cYou can already see the connection present in some areas, in the Sahel for instance, where the militaries deployed have to face a situation on the ground that is evolving in terms of climate change conditions. We need to adapt our capacity to operate in these theatres.\u201d\n\nAmong the aims of the Finnish armed forces is to decrease emissions from buildings and barracks by 75 per cent by 2025 through ending the use of fossil fuel and the possible use of biofuels in army, navy and air force operations in the future.\n\nEnvironmental protection is a key aspect of every Finnish government department after the centre-left coalition came to power in the country in last April\u2019s election. The right-wing Finns Party had attempted during the campaign to portray measures against climate change as a fad of the urban elite which would harm the working class without success.\n\nMatti Putkonen, a Finns Party politician, had claimed that the measures will \u201ctake the sausage from the mouths of labourers\u201d and that pet food would increase hugely in price. He said: \u201cWhat are you going to say to the little girl or boy who cries when mum and dad say they can\u2019t afford [food] any longer? And take the lovable pet to be put down?\u201d\n\nEnvironmental measures have been similarly targeted by other right-wing parties and politicians internationally, including Alternative for Germany, Donald Trump and his Republican supporters and the Bolsanaro administration in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThe march of the right wing we have seen in many countries in Europe stopped in Finland with the moderate parties treating climate as an important issue with the electorate,\u201d said Robert Emerson, a security and political analyst.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro is among the politicians who have attacked environmental safeguards and used it to try and whip up populism. So we are looking at two fundamentally opposing positions here and it\u2019s fitting that climate became such an issue at the Helsinki meeting and Finland has become a key player in the measures being proposed over the Amazon.\u201d", "description": "The confrontation between the Bolsonaro government and the EU over the devastating Amazon fires has escalated \u2013 with\u00a0France, Ireland and Finland threatening\u00a0to scrap a trade agreement with Brazil, and Germany and Norway stopping contributions to an aid fund for the country.", "authors": ["Kim Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/17/fire-amazon-brush.jpg"}
