Mr Williams had encouraged his followers to use the hashtag \"#RacistDebraMessing\", which became a trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\nThe president also claimed, in apparent reference to comments by Whoopi Goldberg about Ms Messing's tweet, that the actor was attempting to employ the methods of Joseph McCarthy, who made wild claims of treason against his political enemies in the 1940s and 1950s. Those methods, known today as McCarthyism, resulted in blacklists for professionals believed to be communists or communist sympathisers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \"Huge damage\" as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Is also being accused of being a Racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness,\" Mr Trump wrote.\n\nHe then continued, referencing the backlash to actor Roseanne Barr in 2018, when her show on ABC was cancelled following her sending a racist tweet: \"If Roseanne Barr said what she did, even being on a much higher rated show, she would have been thrown off television.\"\n\n\"Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? ABC fired Roseanne. Watch the double standard!\"\n\nThe claims on Twitter came as the United States was battered by Hurricane Dorian, which has left hundreds of thousands of people without power in the southeastern United States.\n\nMr Trump had come under fire for claiming that the storm was expected to hit Alabama, even though no official forecasts had indicated that. Mr Trump then was seen with an doctored illustration of the hurricane path, with what appeared to be a felt-tipped drawing to show the storm hitting Alabama.", "description": "Donald Trump has launched a renewed attack on Will and Grace actor Debra Messing, calling her racist for retweeting an controversial image,\u00a0as a powerful hurricane continued\u00a0tearing into regions along the\u00a0US east coast.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/00/gettyimages-902337908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
