And the prince couldn't help but crack a knowing smile when the interviewer asked him, \"There's been a lot of talk in the press about rifts with your brother. How much of that is true?\"\n\nIn reply, Harry said, \"Erm... Part of this role and part of this job, and this family being under the pressure it's under, inevitably stuff happens. But, look, we're brothers, we'll always be brothers. We're certainly on different paths at the moment. But I will always be there for him, as I know he'll always be there for me.\"\n\n'As brothers you have good days, you have bad days'\n\n\n\nPrince Harry says the 'majority of stuff' written about his relationship with his brother William is 'created out of nothing' and adds: 'I love him dearly' #HarryAndMeghan https://t.co/GWs5KfuovM pic.twitter.com/bW7GVALZR6\n\n\n\n\u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 20, 2019\n\nHarry conceded, \"We don't see each other as much as we used to, because we're so busy. But I love him dearly, and the majority of the stuff [reported in the press]... is created out of nothing.\"\n\nUnderstandably, now that the brothers have families of their own, they're not able to spend so much time together. But Harry made it clear that he will always have a special bond with William. He explained, \"Y'know, as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The duke got candid when asked about \"rifts\" with his brother.", "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fQzHKHK04OtsM4EQ_V3XAg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/69b7acdf66d942b4c66e5dd530d5a53c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
