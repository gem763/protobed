Leclerc, on new rubber, banged in a succession of fastest laps and duly found himself in the lead when Vettel later emerged from his pit stop. But then Vettel's engine went kaput.\n\nThe German jumped out of the car after a few expletives criticising the hybrid engine - for it was a hybrid problem that had befallen him - and ran back to the paddock, his mood as black as night.\n\nLewis Hamilton does his customary celebration of throwing the winning trophy into the air on the podium\n\nThere wasn't a huge amount of overtaking action for the fans in Russia, but it was a fascinating tactical race\n\nKimi Raikkonen had an unfortunate afternoon, losing time after a false start and then being punished with a drive through\n\nRobet Kubica struggled with his Williams in the race, propping up the rest of the field from the back for much of the race\n\nLewis Hamilton was able to maintain his lead after the safety car was deployed after an incident involving George Russell\n\nGeorge Russell had a problem with his brakes while under the safety car, and was then forced to retire himself", "description": "JONATHAN MCEVOY IN SOCHI: Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix, as fortune favoured him and Ferrari floundered.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For Mailonine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/29/14/19073692-0-image-a-62_1569764576005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
