REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nTrump and Khan met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Trump is to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this week.\n\nThe president reiterated to Khan as they began their meeting with reporters present that he would be willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.\n\nMuslim-majority Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. Both countries rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full. Two of the three wars they have fought have been over it.\n\n\u201cIf I can help, I\u2019d like to help,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI want everyone to be treated well.\u201d\n\nKhan told Trump Kashmir was facing a humanitarian issue with millions under siege. He asked Trump to implore Modi to lift the siege, saying the crisis could get much worse.\n\n\u201cAt least lift the siege,\u201d said Khan.\n\nHe said Trump heads the most powerful country in the world and that the United States has a responsibility to use its influence on the United Nations Security Council.\n\n\u201cWe look to the U.S. to put out flames in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump noted that Modi in his speech had made \u201ca very aggressive statement\u201d before more than 50,000 Indian-Americans at a \u201cHowdy Modi\u201d event on Sunday in Houston.\n\n\u201cI will say it was very well-received within the room, the statement itself. But it was a very aggressive statement and I hope that they are going to be able to come together, India and Pakistan, to do something that is really smart and good for both. There\u2019s always a solution and I really believe there\u2019s a solution to that,\u201d said Trump.\n\nAs for Afghanistan, Trump said U.S.-led forces have hit the Taliban hard over the past two weeks since a peace initiative collapsed.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he hoped India and Pakistan could come together to resolve their differences over Kashmir, as Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan urged Trump to use U.S. influence to help end India's \"siege\" of the volatile territory.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433036135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1PM", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
