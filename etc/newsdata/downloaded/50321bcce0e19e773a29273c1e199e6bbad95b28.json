(Rafael Marchante/Reuters)\n\nSpain\u2019s Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to prison terms of between nine and 13 years Monday, a ruling that triggered immediate protests and a police response.\n\nA 2017 referendum on Catalan independence, which Madrid deemed illegal, and the subsequent trial of those behind it have split Spanish society like no other events since the country\u2019s democratic transition in the mid-1970s after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nIn response to Monday\u2019s ruling, separatist sympathizers in Catalonia vowed massive civil disobedience in a rejection of a process they deemed overly harsh. National police forces descended on Barcelona, the Catalan capital, as demonstrations began in haste.\n\n\u201cThese have been political proceedings, putting people on trial solely and exclusively for their political ideas,\u201d said Alfred Bosch, Catalonia\u2019s Minister for Foreign Action, Institutional Relations, and Transparency, in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe prison sentences imposed upon the nine Catalan leaders represent a historical error that, far from solving the problem, merely worsens it.\u201d\n\nStill, at least one Catalan civic group said it would respect the court\u2019s ruling. In a statement, the Catalan Civil Society urged local authorities \u201cnot to call for confrontation.\u201d\n\nThree other defendants were found guilty merely of disobedience, which means they will be fined but not serve prison time. All 12 defendants were acquitted of the more serious charge of rebellion, but top Catalan officials were given the lengthier sentences.\n\n[Is the Catalan separatist trial in Spain about law or politics?]\n\nSpanish prosecutors initially sought a prison term of 25 years for Oriol Junqueras, Catalonia\u2019s former vice president and the highest-ranking Catalan official on trial. Junqueras was ultimately given a sentence of 13 years, the longest the court handed down.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Junqueras said Monday that Catalan independence was \u201ccloser than ever.\u201d His comments were relayed by his Republic Left party.\n\n\u201cA total of 100 years of prison. How horrible. Now more than ever, we will be with you and your families. For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,\u201d said Carles Puigdemont, Catalonia\u2019s former regional president, in a statement on Twitter. Puigdemont fled Spain to Belgium after calling the 2017 referendum.\n\nThe ruling looks set to play a role in Spanish elections in early November, the fourth vote the country has held in four years. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, a Socialist, failed to form a government after winning a general election in April, largely because of a standoff with smaller parties on the far left and political center.\n\nPolitical analysts saw the vote in the context of Spain\u2019s mounting political fragmentation. There are two political parties in the Spanish parliament that support Catalan independence, and it was unclear how the verdict in the Catalan trial would affect the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either going to get the pro-independence political parties more votes, or people will come to the conclusion that we\u2019ve been through this now, we have a sentence, and they won\u2019t get votes,\u201d said William Chislett, an analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute, a Madrid think tank.\n\n\u201cWhich way it\u2019s going to go is anybody\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nMcAuley reported from Paris.\n\nFugitive Catalan leader, wanted for rebellion, is running for office by Skype\n\nFor some, Catalonia crackdown evokes memories of the dark days of Spain\u2019s dictatorship\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The leaders that organized the 2017 independence referendum received jail terms of between nine and 13 years, in a case that has divided the nation.", "authors": ["Pamela Rolfe", "James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/98j3W_BysJGthFlUYryRjh6zgnM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OJ3S4ZXOLQI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
