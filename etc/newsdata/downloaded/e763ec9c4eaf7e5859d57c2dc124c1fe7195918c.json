It\u2019s a special tournament to play in, a competition we all grew up wanting to play in one day,\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain told BT Sport.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to be back out there (after) seeing the boys do so well last year. I was fortunate enough to get back involved on the bench for the big day in the final and watch them bring it home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inspirational, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to get back to do. It\u2019s just nice to be back in the starting line-up and try to put in a performance to help the team. To get a few goals was a bonus.\u201d\n\nLiverpool host Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday and Oxlade-Chamberlain said his side would look to return to winning ways after a 1-1 draw at Manchester United last weekend ended the leaders\u2019 100% record in the competition.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot to improve on from the game at the weekend, same again tonight. But ... we\u2019re getting results which are good and we can still improve. We\u2019ll take a lot from this game,\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the manager has a lot of points he\u2019ll be getting at us ... because we\u2019re going need to get them right to put on a good performance and get the right result.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrated his return to the Champions League with two goals on Wednesday, 18 months after the England international midfielder suffered a serious knee injury against Roma.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444369978&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N09K", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
