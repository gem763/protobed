Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter.\n\nThirty-two percent of respondents said that Mr. Trump\u2019s request during a July phone call asking Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden and his son was appropriate, compared to 62% who said it was inappropriate.\n\nMr. Trump has called the phone call with Mr. Zelensky \u201cperfect\u201d and has said he\u2019s less concerned about Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign than he is about corruption. He has raised questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business interests in Ukraine and China.\n\nA plurality, 49% to 44%, said they approve of how congressional Democrats have handled the impeachment inquiry. By a 56% to 33% margin, respondents said they disapprove of how congressional Republicans have responded to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe survey of 1,007 adults was taken Oct. 1-6 and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
