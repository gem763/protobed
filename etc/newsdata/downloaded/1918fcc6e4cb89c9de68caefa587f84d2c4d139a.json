We didn\u2019t play with enough urgency or risk. That was the message at half-time,\u201d Lampard said.\n\n\u201cWe were much better in the second half. You saw spirit and energy in the team. We could have won by more to make the last 10 minutes more comfortable.\n\n\u201cWe had a bit of a problem in the game and we solved it. The players need to be brave and confident. I\u2019m pleased with that.\u201d\n\nWhile a title challenge is likely to be beyond Chelsea, they look well equipped to challenge for a top four finish.\n\n\u201cWe know we want to be challenging in the top four. From the slightly difficult start we had, it is a good sign we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Lampard said.\n\n\u201cThat must only give us the hunger to move on because football can change in an instant.\u201d\n\nNewcastle have now won just one of their last 26 league visits to Chelsea after a defeat that punctured the momentum from their 1-0 win against Manchester United before the international break.\n\nSteve Bruce\u2019s side are back in the relegation zone and the Newcastle boss blamed referee Andre Marriner.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a blatant foul on Joelinton in front of us in the lead-up to the goal. When you are coming here you need those decisions to go for you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have had a really tough start in terms of who we have played. Now we\u2019ve got a run of games against teams who will be around us. It is a vitally important time.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Homegrown charge \u2013\n\nFikayo Tomori, Ross Barkley, Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham all featured for Chelsea, making it five English players in their starting line-up in the Premier League for the first time since February 2013.\n\nMount led the charge of Chelsea\u2019s homegrown youngsters when the midfielder collected Hudson-Odoi\u2019s pass and spun for a fierce shot that was pushed away by Martin Dubravka.\n\nAlonso earned a yellow card for a crunching challenge on DeAndre Yedlin, prompting a barrage of abuse from the Newcastle supporters crammed into one corner of the Shed End.\n\nWith nine goals already this term, Abraham was inches away from getting into double figures when his header from Willian\u2019s corner crashed against the bar.\n\nAbraham was narrowly off-target with another towering header from Chelsea\u2019s eighth corner.\n\nHudson-Odoi was a constant menace with his mesmerising bursts and when his cross found Pulisic, the United States winger was denied by Dubravka\u2019s fine scrambling save.\n\nChelsea\u2019s pressure finally told in the 73rd minute when Hudson-Odoi teed up Alonso, unmarked inside the Newcastle area, for a powerful effort that flashed under Dubravka\u2019s hand into the far corner.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Frank Lampard urged Chelsea to build on their rise into the Premier League\u2019s top four after Marcos Alonso clinched a 1-0 win", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/96c4b0_chelsea-defender-marcos-alonso-celebrates-his-goal-newcastle-lampard-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
