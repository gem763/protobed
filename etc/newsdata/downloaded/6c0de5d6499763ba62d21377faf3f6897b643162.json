North Korea was initially listed on a tentative speaking schedule - dated July 10 - to again be represented at ministerial level, but a revised agenda issued on Friday downgraded Pyongyang\u2019s representation.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Kim Song is now expected to address the 193-member world body on Sept. 30, the second last speaker for the week-long gathering.\n\nThe United States is trying to kick-start stalled talks with North Korea aimed at dismantling Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for those programs.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s U.N. mission appeared to play down the absence of Ri, the country\u2019s former chief nuclear negotiator, saying Pyongyang has been represented at various levels in the past.\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. North Korean ally and neighbour China has encouraged the talks process and China\u2019s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, visited Pyongyang this week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has met with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un three times, most recently in June when he became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.\n\nThey agreed then to reopen working-level negotiations, but that has not happened and since February North Korea has demanded that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo be replaced with a \u201cmore mature\u201d person in the U.S. negotiating team, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump.\n\nLast month Ri called Pompeo the \u201cdiehard toxin of the U.S. diplomacy\u201d who employs \u201chackneyed sanctions rhetoric.\u201d Ri and Pompeo met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly last year. They were also both part of a summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February.\n\nNorth Korea's KCNA news agency on Saturday quoted its vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, as saying that a recent remark by Pompeo about \"North Korea's rogue behaviour\" will make talks with the United States more difficult. here\n\nThe situation has been further complicated by a series of missile launches by North Korea since June, which it says have been in protest against U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises and the adoption of new weapons.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has met twice behind closed-doors at the request of Britain, France and Germany to discuss the launches. The 15-member council demanded in 2006 that Pyongyang suspend its ballistic missile program and stop launches.", "description": "North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho will not attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations later this month \"due to his schedule,\" the country's mission to the U.N. told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426345706&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8401A"}
