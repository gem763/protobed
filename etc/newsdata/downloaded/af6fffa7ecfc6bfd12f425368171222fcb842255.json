I swear life is funny. Because some of the craziest things that happened to you, end up being the thing you needed most,\u201d the Jumanji star said.\n\n\u201cIn this case I basically feel like God told me to slow down. When you\u2019re moving too fast and doing too much, sometimes you can\u2019t see the things you\u2019re meant to see,\u201d Hart explained. \u201cAfter my accident, I see things differently\u2026 My appreciation for life is through the roof.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the 40-year-old is seen wearing a hospital gown and oxygen mask, while at one point being helped to his feet by two nurses. It also shows him undergoing physical therapy and having oil applied to scars, with doctors telling him a full recovery could take up to a year.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take today for granted, because today\u2019s not promised,\u201d Hart urges his followers. \u201cMore importantly I\u2019m thankful for God, thankful for life. Basically you realize you\u2019re not in control. No matter how much you think you\u2019re in control, you\u2019re not in control. And at the end of the day, it can all be over.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Comedian and actor Kevin Hart is thanking\u00a0God for saving his life following a horrific\u00a0car accident last month that left him with serious injuries, saying in an emotional video that his appreciation for life is now \"through the roof.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kevinhartsthanks1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
