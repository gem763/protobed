The Met has been planning the policing operation for this protest, unprecedented in its length and scale, for several months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are planning a prolonged, co-ordinated protest, designed to bring the heart of London to a standstill and disrupt the daily business of people who live, work and are visiting London.\n\n\u2018Londoners need to know that while we will do everything in our power to minimise and manage the impact of these protests, they will inevitably cause significant disruption.\n\n\u2018The organisers have said that one of their aims is to overwhelm police resources. This is hugely disappointing and irresponsible, when officers are working hard every day to tackle violence and keep the capital safe and secure.\n\n\u2018Significant operations like this take officers away from their communities and core responsibilities, but Londoners can still count on the Met to respond to crime.\n\nLily covered herself in rubbish she found while out walking in nature reserves (Picture: Metro.co.uk/Joe Roberts)\n\n\u2018To ensure that this protest is proportionately policed, officers are being drawn from across the service, with shifts extended and rest days cancelled. This will impact on officers and staff and I want to acknowledge and commend their commitment.\n\n\u2018The policing plan is well resourced and flexible to respond to the activities of this group. Our role is to provide a lawful and proportionate police response, balancing the rights of the community whilst recognising the right to lawfully protest.\n\n\u2018If protestors are breaking the law, officers will seek to arrest them at the earliest opportunity and those arrested can expect to be charged, prosecuted, and receive a criminal record.\n\n\u2018The Met will continue to work with partners across the capital to try and minimise disruption, and we will continue to engage with the organisers and urge them to consider the huge impact their actions will have on the capital.\u2019", "description": "Parliament Square was empty of traffic except for police vans and bicycles, while helicopters circled overhead, as protesters created roadblocks on Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, Victoria Street, Whitehall and the Mall.", "authors": ["Richard Hartley-Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Xr-2-a83c_1570475762.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
