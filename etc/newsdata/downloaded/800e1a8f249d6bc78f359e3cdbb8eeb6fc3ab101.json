For example, she and Beckett can't go to a playground or a public pool.\n\n\"They [siblings of kids with cancer] often get bounced around while their brother or sister is getting treatment. Their whole worlds are flipped upside down, usually overnight,\" Burge told \"GMA.\"\n\nShe wrote in her post, \"Vomiting between play sessions. Waking up to throw up. Standing by her brothers side and rubbing his back while he gets sick. Going from 30 lbs to 20 lbs. This is childhood cancer. Take it or leave it.\"\n\nBurge found that by being very open with her daughter about Beckett's condition has helped Aubrey to move away from the resentment she initially felt when Beckett was diagnosed. Now, she wants to be his caretaker and understands when he's not well enough to play.\n\n\"By letting her participate she seems to embrace it a bit more. So often the siblings get forgotten,\" Burge said.\n\nWhen he is feeling well, the pair love to read together. They play school and do puzzles. They dress up in costumes.\n\nThe future looks bright for Beckett. Burge said he is in a \"maintenance\" phase right now, with two different kinds of chemo -- one weekly and one monthly. She hopes that he will be cancer-free by August of 2021.\n\nBy that time, Aubrey will be 7, Beckett will be 6 and their little sister Chandler will be 3.\n\n\"I hope they can go to the playground together,\" Burge said. \"And just do all the normal stuff siblings do together.\"", "description": "A mom's powerful social media post shows the siblings often forgotten on the journey.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190911beckettchildhoodcancer_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
