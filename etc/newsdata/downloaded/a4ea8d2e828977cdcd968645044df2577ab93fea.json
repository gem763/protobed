Other US forces in the region were still in position for now, the official added.\n\nKurdish-led forces in northeast Syria said today that US forces had withdrawn from areas at the border with Turkey where a threatened Turkish offensive would hurt its war against ISIS and roll back five years of security achievements.\n\nThe White House released a statement Sunday, saying President Trump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erogdan by telephone to discuss the plans for Turkey to invade Northern Syria (both leaders pictured in June 2019)\n\nA video posted by a Kurdish news agency showed a convoy of American armored vehicles apparently heading away from the border area of Tal Abyad.\n\nErdogan spoke hours after the White House said US forces in northeastern Syria will move aside and clear the way for an expected Turkish assault - essentially abandoning Kurdish fighters who fought alongside American forces in the years-long battle to defeat ISIS.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ankara before departing for a visit to Serbia, Erdogan also said he planned to visit Washington to meet with Trump in the first half of November.\n\nHe said the two leaders would discuss plans for the 'safe zone', and added that he hoped to resolve a dispute over F-35 fighter jets during his visit.\n\nThe US informed the commander of the Kurdish-led SDF forces in Syria on Monday morning that US forces will not defend them from Turkish attacks anywhere, according to a source.\n\nIn a major shift in US policy, the White House released a statement late on Sunday, saying President Trump spoke with Erogdan by telephone to discuss the plans and the US will remove all of its forces from the 'immediate area'.\n\n'Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operating into Northern Syria,' the statement reads. 'The Unites States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial ''Caliphate,'' will no longer be in the immediate area.'\n\nThe White House also confirmed that Turkey plans to take into custody all ISIS fighters captured over the past two years that European powers have refused to take in.\n\nSyrian Kurds gather around a US armored vehicle during a demonstration against Turkish threats next to a US-led international coalition base on the outskirts of Ras al-Ain town in Syria's Hasakeh province near the Turkish yesterday\n\nThe Turkish and US troops start their second joint ground patrol within a planned safe zone in northern Syria along the Syrian-Turkish border, in Sanliurfa, Turkey, last month\n\n'The United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused.'\n\n'The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area capture over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial ''Caliphate'' by the United States.'\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed force that controls much of the northeast region along Turkey's border, added it 'will not hesitate for a single moment' to defend itself from an expected Turkish invasion.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that reports on the war, said US forces had withdrawn from an area between the towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.\n\nSDF leader, led by the Kurdish YPG militia, said the Turkish invasion 'will have a great negative impact' on the war against ISIS.\n\nIt said in a statement: 'Despite our efforts to avoid any military escalation with Turkey and the flexibility we have shown to move forward in establishing a mechanism for the security of the borders ...the American forces did not fulfill their commitments and withdrew their forces from the border areas with Turkey.\n\n'Turkey is now preparing for an invasion operation of northern and eastern Syria,' added the SDF, which with US backing in recent years defeated Islamic State, also known as Daesh fighters, across much of northern and eastern Syria.\n\nThe Turkish military operation 'will have a great negative impact on our war against the Daesh organisation and will destroy everything that has been achieved with regards to stability during the last years,' it added.\n\n'The Unites States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation,' the statement reads\n\nFighters from a new border security force under the command of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dance during a graduation ceremony in Hasaka, northeastern Syria, last January\n\nPanos Moumtzis, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Syria, speaking in Geneva, stressed there were 'a lot of unanswered questions' about the consequences of the operation.\n\nHe added: 'We don't know what is going to happen...we are preparing for the worst.'\n\nMore than 1,000 US troops are currently deployed in northeastern Syria but will not longer be present during the invasions.\n\nThe US soldiers work closely with the Kurdish YPG, which leads the Syrian Democratic Forces in the regions.\n\nOn Monday, the US-backed SDF said such an operation would reverse years of successful Kurdish-led operations to defeat the Islamic State group and allow some of its surviving leaders to come out of hiding.\n\nIt also warned that a Turkish invasion would pose a threat to SDF-run prisons and informal settlements housing thousands of IS jihadists and their families.\n\nAnkara wants to push the US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces from its border, saying that the group is a 'terrorist' offshoot of Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish military has twice launched offensives in Syria - against IS in 2016, and in 2018 against the People's Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the SDF.\n\nLong marginalised, Syria's Kurds have - beyond heavy campaigns against IS - essentially stayed out of the country's eight-year civil war, instead setting up their own institutions in areas under their control.\n\nIn the areas of Ras al-Ayn, Tal Abyad and Kobane, all bordering Turkey, Kurdish forces have dug trenches and tunnels in preparation for a Turkish offensive, the Observatory said Sunday.\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Syrian Democratic Forces said Sunday night that it had fulfilled its commitment to the U.S. proposal for the 'security mechanism' along the border and says that any Turkish attack will 'reverse the successful effort to defeat #ISIS\n\nThe US announcement will likely be seen as a long-feared abandonment of Kurdish allies who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against the Islamic State militants.\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Syrian Democratic Forces said Sunday night that it had fulfilled its commitment to the US proposal for the 'security mechanism' along the border and says that any Turkish attack will 'reverse the successful effort to defeat #ISIS.\n\n'But Erdogan's threats are aimed to change the security mechanism into a mechanism of death, displace our people & change the stable & secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war,' the SDF tweeted, warning that a Turkish military invasion would make Syria 'a permanent conflict area'.\n\nFor months, Turkish Erdogan has threatened to launch the military assault against Kurdish forces across the border he views as a threat to his country.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have warned that allowing the Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds, sending a troubling message to American allies across the globe.\n\nMuslim convert Jack Letts, from Oxfordshire, has been pictured gaunt and lying on the floor in an overcrowded jail in northern Syria\n\nOne of the ISIS soldiers expected to be moved to Turkey custody is British Jihadi Jack Letts, who was pictured just days ago.\n\nDubbed 'Jihadi Jack', he was filmed among dozens of fellow Islamic State (IS) prisoners, also in orange jumpsuits, who have been captured by Kurdish militia.\n\nThe 23-year-old Muslim convert from Oxfordshire, who declared himself an 'enemy of Britain' and fled to the Middle East to join IS, has been stripped of his UK citizenship.\n\nHis mother Sally Lane pleaded for Letts to be allowed to return and face trial in this country so that he can be rescued from the conditions in which he is being held, but the Home Office dismissed her plea.\n\nSeeing the first images of Letts in his cell since he was taken prisoner two years ago, she told The Mail on Sunday: 'It's heart-rending to see your son like this and to feel so completely powerless.\n\n'We have been pressing the Red Cross for months to tell us what the jail is really like, but they always refuse, saying that to release this information would jeopardize their access.'", "description": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw from parts of northeast Syria after his phone call with President Donald Trump, in which the US handed control to Turkey..", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/06/19381872-0-image-a-31_1570427896576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
