Detailed minutes which would have shone a light on the crucial decision-making process are absent or incomplete which is a matter of great regret.'\n\nMore generally, the MPs' report criticises 'poor management, leadership and governance at the BBC'. It said the problems surrounding the use of personal service companies \u2013 its arrangements with its freelancers, including presenters \u2013 may have arisen from poor management.\n\n'Future issues may emerge as a result of the same management and governance approach,' the report said.\n\nCriticising BBC director-general Lord Hall, the report says he should have sought 'the formal agreement of the [now defunct] Executive Board before recommending [the deal] to the BBC Trust'.\n\nFrom next June, BBC bosses announced they will give free licences to only those over-75s who are on pension credits\n\nThe report also says that overall finances of the BBC paint a 'disturbing picture' \u2013 with pressure on the corporation's budgets likely to get worse.\n\nMr Collins said: 'We are seeing clear evidence that the funding model of the BBC will become unsustainable without substantial increases in commercial revenue from BBC Studios and new subscription on demand viewing services like BritBox.'\n\nBBC chairman Sir David Clementi said: 'Under the 2015 agreement, the BBC was given responsibility for the policy, and related funding, of the concession for over-75s. We are pleased that the committee recognise that there was no automatic assumption that the BBC would continue to bear the cost of these free TV licences.'\n\nCaroline Abrahams, of charity Age UK, said: 'The BBC's plan to means test these licences for over-75s from June 2020 will result in significant numbers being forced to choose between buying a licence, cutting back on essentials like heating and eating, or continuing to watching the TV without a licence, thereby breaking the law.\n\n'The Government and the BBC would be wise to sit down and broker a solution... before all hell potentially breaks loose next summer.'", "description": "The Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee said it was wrong to make pensioners in Britain pay the \u00a3154.50-a-year charge from next June.", "authors": ["John Stevens Deputy Political Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/19565482-0-image-a-9_1570753591517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
