What do we do? Stand up, fight back\" and \"Children are under attack. What do we do? Stand up, fight back.\" Protesters also held a banner that read, \"Hate is not normal.\"\n\nThe demonstrators appeared to shout the names of multiple migrants who have died in immigration custody in recent months, including several children. The treatment of immigrants at border facilities has roiled McAleenan's tenure since he took over the agency this past Aprilfollowing then-DHS chief Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation.\n\nThe event's moderator then tried to quell the shouting, which drew favorable applause from some members of the audience. McAleenan then attempted to persuade the audience to no avail.\n\n\"As a career law enforcement professional, I've decided my career to protecting the right to free speech and all the values we hold dear in America from all threats, so we'll go ahead and try one more time,\" he said\u2060\u2014 to which a protester yelled out \"bullsh\u2014t.\"\n\nAfter moderators tried again to simmer the demonstration, McAleenan restarted his speech but soon walked off stage when the chanting began once more.\n\nMcAleenan's predecessor was also subject to protests over the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies, especially the practice of separating migrant children from their parents at the border. Last year, Nielsen wasinterrupted by protesters during a dinner at an upscale Mexican restaurant in Washington.", "description": "The demonstrators shouted, \"Immigrants are under attack.
