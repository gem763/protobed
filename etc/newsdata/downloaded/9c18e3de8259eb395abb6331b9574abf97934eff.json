One of those dimensions was the ideology of the respondents according to which cable news or broadcast network they \u201ctrust most.\u201d\n\nCurious?\n\nAmong those who trust Fox News the most, 77% described themselves as conservative, 19% were moderates and 6% liberal. Among those who trust CNN the most, 20% are conservative, 43% moderate and 35% liberal. And oh yes, among those who trust MSNBC, 9% are conservative, 32% moderate and 55% liberal.\n\nBy the way, among those who trust PBS the most, 9% are conservative, 38% moderate and 50% liberal. Among C-SPAN fans, 26% are conservative, 53% moderate and 23% liberal.\n\nLets peek at the \u201cBig Three\u201d broadcast networks as well. Among those who trust CBS the most, 14% are conservative, 61% moderate and 15% liberals. Among NBC fans, 4% are conservative, 50% moderate and 30% liberal. And among ABC\u2019s folks, 19% are conservative, 54% moderate and 24% liberal. The survey of 1,000 registered U.S. voters was conducted Oct. 23-26.\n\nBeyond mere curiosity, should we care about all these numbers? Well, yes. There are a lot of moderate viewers. But with over three-quarters of its viewership weighing in as conservative, Fox News has the most pronounced set of fans. At the same time, the network also dominates the entire cable realm. Fox News is now marking 40 consecutive months as the most watched network in the entire cable realm and has also bested cable news rivals CNN and MSNBC for 18 consecutive years. Yes, 18 years. The implications also suggest that conservatives qualify as a much coveted, loyal audience \u2014 and they show up. See the Foxified item further down in the column.\n\nIMPEACHMENT, ACT II\n\nHigh-profile Democrats hope the impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d against President Trump turns into an impeachment process with all the trimmings \u2014 high crimes, misdemeanors, frantic news coverage, melodrama, curtain calls. Yes, uh-huh, they can hope.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have been trying to suggest they have the goods on Trump. But fact is, none of the witnesses they have called so far have any firsthand knowledge of presidential wrongdoing. Behind closed doors and with no media allowed, House Democrats have tried to put on the appearance of a legal proceeding. At the end of each session, they leak what they claim happened. The media are all too willing to play along, printing the Democratic pols\u2019 claims as if they were fact,\u201d writes New York Post columnist Betsy McCaughey.\n\nShe points out that the clock is ticking; Democrats don\u2019t want the inquiry to drag on or to face a high court.\n\n\u201cWithout evidence of grave wrongdoing, the Republican-controlled Senate won\u2019t remove this president from office. But Dems have one goal \u2014 to impeach Trump, damaging him sufficiently to tip the 2020 election,\u201d explains Ms. McCaughey.\n\n\u201cPolls show fewer than half of voters supporting impeachment in key swing states like Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These are states Trump won in 2016, and Pelosi has been reluctant to put Democratic members from these states on the spot. Trump called her bluff. Now the Democrats will have to put up or shut up,\u201d the columnist says.\n\nIndeed. The House Rules Committee meets at 3 p.m. Wednesday to consider a resolution that formalizes the impeachment inquiry and outlines the process moving forward. C-SPAN will be there. Meanwhile, the aforementioned Suffolk University/USA Today poll reveals that \u201cAmericans of all stripes\u201d say the House won\u2019t end up voting to impeach Mr. Trump, by a 56% to 37% margin \u2014 while 73% predict he won\u2019t be removed from office.\n\nA RARE QUIET MOMENT\n\nAn event of note for Wednesday: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. French Hill, Arkansas Republican, will venture outside to the grounds of the Capitol to plant a white oak tree to honor Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nThe trio cite the 26th president\u2019s role in conservation \u2014 he created the Forest Service, established 1,500 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, five national parks and designated 200 million acres as national forests. Among other things.\n\nYay. And a round of applause.\n\nPRAGER\u2019S WARNING ABOUT THE LEFT\n\nOnce, parents worried that consumer culture and too much TV would rob young Americans of their childhood. Now comes a more dire warning from columnist and broadcaster Dennis Prager.\n\n\u201cHere are some of the messages the left has been giving America\u2019s young people: Your past is terrible, and your future is terrible. The American past is a story of genocide, slavery, racism, patriarchy and colonialism. You should be ashamed of it. As regards your future, your very existence is in jeopardy. You may well die at a young age unless society completely shifts from fossil fuels to wind and solar power. In fact, your future is so bleak you should probably not consider getting married and having children,\u201d writes Mr. Prager in a Townhall.com op-ed.\n\nHe also points out the specifics for boy, girls, patriotic kids and young people of faith.\n\n\u201cOnly when one understands that the left \u2014 the left, not liberalism \u2014 has always and everywhere been a destructive force can one begin to understand what is happening to America. And the left has damaged no group more than America\u2019s youth. Leftists speak about \u2018the children\u2019 \u2014 but they care about \u2018the children\u2019 as much as the communists cared about \u2018the workers.\u2019\u201d\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFox News remains the most-watched cable network of all for the 40th consecutive month, according to Nielsen Media Research.
