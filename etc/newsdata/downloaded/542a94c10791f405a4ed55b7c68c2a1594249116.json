Atkins also had back spasms between Games 2 and 3.\n\nBut the stakes are at an all-time high for the club. The Mystics will win their first WNBA title if they beat the Connecticut Sun in Game 4.\n\nDelle Donne joked that basketball is not an ideal sport to play with a bad back. She is continuing to deal with some pain; she needed to figure out which positions she can sleep in pain-free.\n\nThe league MVP missed most of Game 2 with the injury but posted 13 points and six rebounds Sunday in Game 3, which Washington won 94-81. Kristi Toliver carried the Mystics that day with 20 points on 7 of 9 shooting and 10 assists and Emma Meesseman scored 21 off the bench.\n\nGame 4 tips off at 8 p.m. and will be broadcast on ESPN2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
