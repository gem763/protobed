That scrutiny was evident on Tuesday night, when for the first time her wealth-tax proposal was the focus of much discussion at the primary debate in Ohio.\n\n\u201cShe clearly went into the debate the other day as the front-runner or the co-front-runner, which is why she was subject to so many attacks,\u201d said Democratic strategist Craig Varoga, who is unaffiliated with any of the presidential campaigns.\n\nWarren has called for a 2 percent tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. She has said she wants to use that revenue to finance a host of education-related proposals.\n\nWarren has described her plan as a two-cent tax on the wealth of the ultra-rich. Supporters can often be heard chanting \u201ctwo cents\u201d at her rallies.\n\nMichael Linden, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive nonprofit focused on economic policy, said Warren\u2019s wealth-tax proposal has helped to set the terms of the tax discussion in the Democratic primary.\n\nHe said proposals to tax the rich have moved toward center stage in the 2020 race, and that taxing the rich has become a goal in and of itself, rather than just a means to pay for spending plans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA lot of that has to do with the popularity and the capturing of the imagination of the wealth tax,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Linden said, there remains a debate among Democrats about whether raising taxes on the rich is punitive.\n\n\u201cThat idea was still apparent on that stage,\u201d he said, referring to Tuesday night.\n\nThe wealth-tax proposal received little attention at the first three Democratic presidential debates that Warren participated in. It wasn\u2019t explicitly mentioned in her first debate, and in the third debate she brought up the proposal but wasn\u2019t asked about it by the moderators.\n\nIn the second debate, there was only a brief exchange on the proposal between Warren and former Rep.

Moderators devoted a considerable amount of time to the issue, but in doing so Warren was forced to play defense.\n\nFellow candidate Andrew Yang Andrew YangWarren raised more money from Big Tech employees than other 2020 Democrats: Report Saagar Enjeti praises Yang for bringing threat of automation to forefront at Ohio debate Biden, Warren tied for lead in Iowa poll MORE, an entrepreneur, criticized wealth taxes during the debate, arguing it would make more sense to create a value-added tax.\n\nHe said other countries repealed their wealth taxes because they had \u201cmassive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s other on-stage rivals didn\u2019t attack wealth taxes directly, and several even suggested they might be open to a wealth tax. But they did take issue with how Warren spoke about her proposal.\n\nWarren defended her proposal by saying the question isn\u2019t why she and Sanders are backing wealth taxes, \u201cit's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans.\u201d\n\nMore moderate candidates who haven\u2019t proposed wealth taxes but have offered other proposals to raise taxes on the rich took offense with the notion that they wanted to help billionaires.\n\n\u201cNo one is supporting billionaires,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSen.

Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) said he thinks a wealth tax could be part of a plan to combat income inequality but added that he thinks Warren sometimes \u201cis more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other.\"\n\nWarren in turn argued that taxing income isn\u2019t as effective as taxing wealth, and that Democrats succeed when they \"dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\"\n\nShe also said she doesn\u2019t have a problem with billionaires but instead thinks that those at the top should pay more in taxes so that \u201cevery other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\nProgressives said they thought Warren did a good job withstanding criticisms during the debate.\n\n\u201cAttempts to attack her actually put oxygen in the room for one of her most popular ideas, which is taxing the very wealthy in order to pay for things like universal child care and canceling student debt,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren.\n\nBut a debate persists among economists and other tax-policy experts about whether a wealth tax is smart policy.\n\nLinden criticized Yang\u2019s argument that a wealth tax would be hard to implement, saying people had similar concerns before the U.S. instituted an income tax.\n\nWhen Warren released her wealth-tax plan, her campaign said the IRS already has rules for valuing assets for estate-tax purposes, and the IRS would be authorized to tighten those rules. Warren has also proposed measures to prevent people from evading the wealth tax, including an exit tax for wealthy people who renounce their U.S. citizenship.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the center-left think tank Third Way, said he thinks it will be challenging to figure out how to assess what people are worth every year.\n\n\u201cThe wealth tax is almost impossible to implement,\u201d he said. Instead, he recommended raising the top individual income tax rate, making changes to capital gains taxes, and reverting the estate tax back to its previous parameters as good starting points for how to raise taxes on the rich.\n\nWarren\u2019s wealth tax isn\u2019t the only tax issue of hers that has come under increased scrutiny as she rises in the polls. Some of her Democratic rivals have been criticizing her for refusing to give a direct answer to questions about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan.\n\nVaroga said a primary is a vetting process, and \u201cpart of the vetting process is making sure you can take the hit and keep on moving.\u201d\n\nIf Warren maintains her status as a leading candidate, she\u2019s likely to come under more pressure to defend her policy stances.\n\n\u201cBarring some very unforeseen collapse of her campaign, this scrutiny and pressure from her opponents, both at the top and at the bottom, is going to continue,\u201d Varoga said.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s emergence as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary is bringing new attention, and scrutiny, to her proposed wealth tax.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenweathtax_101719hillillustration_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
