One longtime correspondent asks: Was it worth it?", "language": "en", "text": "I woke as the plane crossed into Afghanistan. It was a January evening. Outside my window, snow-covered mountains cut through the desert. In less than an hour, we would descend into Kabul. As a journalist, I had made this trip 10 times over the years \u2014 reporting on soldiers at remote military bases; embedding with Special Forces as they tried to train the Afghan army and build goodwill with the Afghan people; interviewing countless Afghans about the war that has, for nearly two decades, consumed their country.\n\nNow I was headed back. In a few hours I\u2019d meet with Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller, commanding general of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan \u2014 the man tasked with overseeing the end of what has become the longest war in American history. Eighteen years after sweeping across the country in the aftermath of 9/11, the United States was \u2014 pending the outcome of peace talks with the Taliban \u2014 preparing to finally leave. If this never-ending war was really ending, I wanted to see it for myself.\n\nU.S soldiers patrol in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border in 2010. (Rafiq Maqbool/AP)\n\nHamid Karzai International Airport was jammed as everyone piled out of the arrivals terminal into the chilly Kabul evening. A National Guard soldier in Miller\u2019s security detail met me and drove me to the headquarters in an armored truck.\n\nAs we wound through Kabul, I recognized the same billboards from past trips featuring adoring pictures of Afghan hero Ahmad Shah Massoud \u2014 the leader of the Northern Alliance who was killed by al-Qaeda on Sept. 9, 2001. Two days after Massoud\u2019s death, halfway around the globe, I was standing at the window of the newsletter publisher in Arlington where I worked, watching yellow insulation floating in the air after a plane had hit the Pentagon. A few hours later, I took the Metro past deserted Reagan National Airport and watched everyone around me staring in silence at the grounded planes.\n\nWhen the war on terrorism started, I felt an urgent need to cover it. I got a job at a small newspaper in North Carolina that reported on Fort Bragg, and three months later I was in Iraq covering the invasion. A year later, I made it to Afghanistan. A Special Forces soldier told me on my first day with his team that the fighting could be over in a year if the soldiers kept the pressure on the Taliban. But years passed, and the war never quite seemed to end. Over time, the new reality was that Americans were there not just to destroy al-Qaeda \u2014 the original mission \u2014 but to build a stable Afghanistan. By 2010, what had started as a war fought by a few American Special Operations teams had escalated, with troop levels reaching 100,000. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both tried to bring the war to an end with a military victory. Both failed.\n\nFinally, in 2014, combat operations concluded. It was mainly a symbolic ending. American troops transitioned to anti-terrorism operations and training Afghan forces. The burden of fighting the war was shouldered by Afghans, but with a lot of American and NATO help.\n\nEspecially in recent years, the war has become mere background noise for Americans. It was barely mentioned during the first two Democratic presidential debates. Now, the Trump administration is considering a withdrawal of troops in exchange for a Taliban promise to block international terrorists from operating on Afghan soil, as well as assurance the group will take part in an intra-Afghan dialogue.\n\nNot everyone thinks President Trump\u2019s blunt rhetoric about wanting to end the war has been wise. \u201cIf the enemy knows you\u2019re going home regardless, why should he compromise on important issues?\u201d a former senior commander in Afghanistan recently told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rule out the possibility there could be an acceptable agreement, but clearly the context of how the negotiations are being carried out is not the most desirable.\u201d The former commander, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss ongoing negotiations, also questioned the absence of the Afghan government at the bargaining table. \u201cIt is their country after all,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this trip, my first since 2016, I wanted to see whether the new strategy to conclude the war felt different from previous attempts. But another question was looming too, one that was only growing more haunting with the signals that the war was, at last, coming to an end: Was it all worth it? The conflict had left 2,400 U.S. service members dead and more than 20,000 wounded; more than 145,000 people in all, including Afghan military, police and civilians, have died, according to a 2018 report from Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project; America has spent $737 billion on the war. Had all this death and maiming and money been justified by the results? Few people in 2001 disputed that evicting al-Qaeda from Afghanistan was necessary. But that mission had mostly been achieved in the early days of the war. What about everything that had happened since? What had America gotten right, what had we gotten wrong \u2014 and what, in the end, were the consequences?\n\nPhoto of eastern Afghanistan in 2011. (Charles Ommanney/Getty Images)\n\nI. Uruzgan province, 2004\n\nI sat in the back of a truck in a convoy racing toward a village in Uruzgan, a province in the south-central part of the country. It was my first time in Afghanistan, and it was better than I imagined; I loved the majestic mountains and was taken by the busy streets of Kabul. Now, I was shadowing a Special Forces team on the way to a village where a Taliban commander and possibly 50 fighters were holed up.\n\nThe Taliban had taken control of much of Afghanistan in 1996, after decades of civil war. But the group quickly became oppressive; women were forced out of jobs and schools and into burqas that covered them from head to toe. The Taliban also, of course, had been harboring Osama bin Laden \u2014 which was why U.S. forces were there at all. By the time I got to Afghanistan, the war had turned into a ghost hunt for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and bin Laden himself. The captain of the Special Forces team I was with \u2014 a 30-year-old West Point graduate from Nevada with a thick beard and barrel chest \u2014 told me that the big battles were over. They were down to the last fighters. The smart ones. \u201cThe dumb terrorists are dead,\u201d he said.\n\nBy nightfall, everyone was in position. I waited with soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division while the Special Forces team and their Afghan allies crept into the village. All night we waited by the trucks. For a while, every noise sounded like a Taliban fighter creeping toward our position, but soon monotony set in. Nearby, the soldiers stood guard. A couple of hours before dawn, I fell asleep near the back tire of one of the trucks. I woke at dawn when the captain radioed for us to come up to the village.\n\nThe captain of the Special Forces team I was with told me that the big battles were over. They were down to the last fighters. The smart ones. \u201cThe dumb terrorists are dead.\u201d\n\nWe got to a small clearing between a handful of sun-bleached, mud-walled compounds. A few men squatted on one side of the clearing. On the opposite side was a lone man. I walked up to him with the captain, who pointed out that his clothes were clean, he had good shoes, and both his beard and fingernails were groomed.\n\nThe captain told me the man had wandered into the village from the desert with a phone. The villagers didn\u2019t know him. The imam, the village religious leader, thought he came with the Special Forces team. The captain said the villagers cowered from him. The Special Forces soldiers handcuffed and blindfolded the man. It was clear he didn\u2019t belong in the village. They found out 12 hours later he was Abdul Wadud, a Taliban commander.\n\nThe ride back to the Special Forces firebase took most of the day. A few hours after we returned to the base, the soldiers were complaining outside the team room. They told me that griping from elite Afghan circles about Wadud\u2019s capture had been directed toward the U.S. Embassy in Kabul \u2014 which then called the Special Forces task force. I was not able to verify this claim, but the team was angry and frustrated. I never got to the bottom of exactly why there had been lobbying to free Wadud, but at the 11th hour, the captain successfully petitioned to keep him in custody after Wadud admitted his job was to find safe houses for Taliban commanders. A small victory.\n\nFor me, this was a valuable but troubling first glimpse of the other war being fought here: the one behind closed doors. The balance between soldiers trying to win on the battlefield and politicians and diplomats trying to rebuild a country \u2014 with all the political maneuvering that required \u2014 would prove ever-difficult for Americans to navigate.\n\nArmed security guards stand watch at a guesthouse in the town of Istalif. (Dudley M. Brooks)\n\nII. Kabul, 2019\n\nThe Afghanistan mission certainly had its share of well-known generals. Remember Gen. Stan McChrystal? Gen. David Petraeus? McChrystal, who commanded NATO forces from 2009 to 2010, was the warrior monk who lived on one meal a day. He was replaced by Petraeus after Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings wrote an unflattering portrait of him and his staff. Petraeus saved the war in Iraq and arrived in Kabul with a reputation as an insurgent fighter. Neither general, however, was able to win the war in Afghanistan.\n\nMiller arrived in Kabul in September 2018 without the same public image, but with a mandate, essentially, to succeed where his predecessors had failed. As the Trump administration put it in a report to Congress in June 2019: \u201cThe principal goal of the South Asia Strategy is a durable and inclusive settlement to the war in Afghanistan that protects the United States homeland from terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nMuch of Miller\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is foggy because most of his career was \u201cbehind the fence\u201d \u2014 a euphemism for serving with Delta, the Army\u2019s tier-one Special Operations unit \u2014 but he has fought on every notable battleground of the past three decades (Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia) and served as the commanding general of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which oversees America\u2019s black operations. He\u2019s the \u201cmost phenomenal general you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d says Linda Robinson, a senior researcher at the Rand Corp. \u201cMiller has never attempted to create a cult of personality,\u201d she notes. \u201cHe is not an egotist.\u201d\n\nI spoke to a few people who worked with Miller at JSOC and other commands, and everyone had the same comments. Smart. Driven. A good leader who cares about his people. They spoke on the condition of anonymity; most were still part of Special Operations units and weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press. \u201cHe is one of the great battle captains of post-9/11 history,\u201d said a former senior commander in Afghanistan who served with Miller. \u201cHe is an extraordinary special operator. Lots of quality time in Afghanistan and not just doing counterterrorism. He is doing the best he can with the resources he has been provided.\u201d\n\nMiller attends a lot of meetings, but few are as important as his three weekly update meetings. At one I went to, he sat at the center of a horseshoe table in front of a bank of flat screens. On the center screen were briefing slides, on the left side the video feed. Miller began the briefing by offering condolences for a Special Forces medic who had been killed during an operation against the Taliban. He said the death was a reminder that Afghanistan is still a high-risk combat environment. For the next 45 minutes, the meeting whipped around the country with generals giving updates. When it was time to brief, a commander \u2014 sometimes an American, often a NATO member \u2014 appeared on the screen.\n\nA few days later, I interviewed Miller in the headquarters\u2019 meeting room and asked him what he thought of the job. \u201cYou know that you will be tired at the end of it \u2014 and with a diminished reputation,\u201d he said, then made clear he was joking. \u201cSo, I came in here with a level of understanding the challenges and difficulties, particularly after the United States involvement for close to two decades here.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Miller was part of the Special Operations forces that stormed into Afghanistan. But in our interview, he admitted he didn\u2019t understand the country then. \u201cIf you really start thinking you\u2019re getting a real clear grasp of Afghanistan, you probably aren\u2019t,\u201d he said. I found that perspective refreshing.\n\nAfghanistan was a war of missed opportunities, and Miller was set on not missing another one. He had taken a hatchet to all the different victory goals of the past and was focused on only two things: a political settlement for Afghanistan and protecting the U.S. homeland by conducting anti-terrorism missions. \u201cWe all have to understand why we\u2019re here,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cAnd if we have everyone focused in the right direction, it comes down to a political settlement.\u201d\n\nWhile U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad continues to negotiate a deal, Afghan forces \u2014 helped by American advisers \u2014 hammer the Taliban, reminding them that the only path to peace is at the table. Dubbed the \u201cblack cloud,\u201d Miller\u2019s strategy focuses on keeping forces agile and constantly moving. Drones, bombers and U.S. and Afghan troops hunt down Taliban and Islamic State members in one province for a few days until the enemy leaves, and then they move to more-fruitful hunting grounds. The strategy has led to unprecedented numbers of Taliban killed.\n\n\u201cThey notice the uptick,\u201d Miller said about the Taliban. \u201cAt the tactical level, you see them adjusting how they\u2019ll communicate, you see how they adjust, how they move across different districts and provinces. So, we do know it has had an effect, but none of this is about body counts. None of this is about killing your way to victory.\u201d\n\nThe prospects for a political settlement get most of the attention, but protecting the homeland is the litmus test that guides Miller\u2019s strategy. It means, essentially, ensuring that Afghanistan will not again become a haven for terrorists who want to attack the United States. It also means that our Afghanistan strategy has now come full circle since Miller first arrived here in 2001.\n\nSoldiers salute Gen. David Petraeus\u2019s motorcade in Kabul in 2011.

The province \u2014 home to 1 million people then \u2014 was a strategic crossroads where al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters slipped easily in and out of neighboring Pakistan.\n\nThe previous year, Khost had been plagued by suicide bombers. But in 2007, violence had decreased. Lt. Col. Scottie Custer, an 82nd Airborne Division artillery officer, was one of the architects of the turnaround. Instead of keeping his troops at Forward Operating Base Salerno \u2014 the hub of U.S. military activity in Khost \u2014 Custer was sending them to smaller outposts in the province\u2019s 11 subdistricts.\n\nThe strategy worked: When the paratroopers moved in, the Taliban moved out. Insurgent attacks and roadside bombs dropped significantly; intercepted Taliban radio transmissions instructed fighters to stay away from Khost. With security came stability. Custer partnered with the local governor and the provincial reconstruction team to start pumping money into the province, which brought schools, dams, roads. The Khost reconstruction team spent $17 million on projects in 2007, compared with only $6 million in the three prior years. Some of that money paid for nearly 100 miles of paved road in a country where most roads were just tire tracks.\n\nBefore I flew back home, Custer was optimistic, and his optimism was infectious. The paratroopers had solved the riddle, he thought. \u201cIt is Afghanistan,\u201d Custer told me, by which he meant that nothing works like you plan it, and nothing is easy. \u201cBut we are going to hand off Khost a lot better than we received it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have to understand why we\u2019re here,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cAnd if we have everyone focused in the right direction, it comes down to a political settlement.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Custer\u2019s strategy really did seem viable. News stories praised it as the way forward. Richard Holbrooke, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who went on to be Obama\u2019s special envoy to Afghanistan, called Khost a \u201csuccess\u201d in an April 2008 column. It was the first time since 2004 that I felt like there was a chance the war might end with a victory. Days before I left Khost, I wrote this for the Fayetteville Observer in North Carolina: \u201cReconstruction aid is flying in, security has drastically improved and for the most part Khostis are happy. They are also busy building multi-story buildings in town and barracks on Forward Operating Base Salerno. Afghanistan can be won; it is just going to take a lot more work and resources.\u201d\n\nA year after I visited, Custer was gone and the wave of suicide bombings returned; among the places attacked was Salerno itself. Of course, even if Custer had stayed, things might not have worked out over the long term. But the constant rotation of personnel did not make things any easier. And this happened all over Afghanistan.\n\nBrian Glyn Williams, a University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth professor of Islamic history who worked with the U.S. military in Afghanistan in the summer of 2009, witnessed how the rotation affected operations. He was working with an information operations cell in Kabul when half the team rotated out. \u201cWe had personal relations with the gray beards,\u201d Williams said, referring to Afghan elders. \u201cWe sort of had a rapport with them. A rhythm. It took a long time to build up that institutional memory for our team. But part of my team switched to Iraq. You\u2019re calibrated to work in one environment, and then they\u2019re deployed to Iraq. All of that institutional knowledge was flushed.\u201d The United States, in short, fell into a pattern of one-year deployments, meaning the war started over every 12 months. America\u2019s longest war turned into 18 one-year wars.\n\nA dozen years after Custer\u2019s efforts, Khost is still a battleground. In November, a suicide bomber killed 26 people and wounded 50, all members of Afghan security forces who had gathered for Friday prayers in the Ismail Khel district of the province. In July of this year, Afghan forces clashed with Taliban fighters; a dozen were killed and 10 were wounded in the fighting. In August, two bombs injured nine people, including two police officers, in Khost city. A few days later, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked a market in the Mandozai district, killing two civilians and injuring seven more.\n\nA wounded Afghan man is brought to an Italian aid organization\u2019s hospital after an explosion in Kabul in May 2019. (Wakil Koshar/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIV. Kabul, 2019\n\nOn my first trip to Kabul, in 2004, I could walk the streets, go to restaurants and shop in the markets. I liked to spend a day or two on each trip buying souvenirs for friends and family and enjoying drinks and dinner at guesthouses in the city. On one trip in 2016, I spent a night on the back of a truck as we went to the market and then dinner.\n\nBut today, Kabul is a city of concrete and checkpoints, meant to ward off attacks like August\u2019s suicide blast that killed 63 people in a wedding hall. Government buildings and embassies are protected by massive barriers. Hotels have quarantine areas where armed guards search cars going in and out for bombs. Concrete walls line the streets, making it impossible to see into compounds.\n\nThe new era began in 2014, when 21 people, including 13 foreigners, were killed at Taverna du Liban, a Lebanese restaurant popular with diplomats, U.N. staff and aid workers. A suicide bomber detonated at the restaurant\u2019s gate, and then two gunmen rushed in and opened fire on the stunned diners.\n\nOn my most recent trip, I talked to a Special Operations officer who works with a team that partners with Afghan security forces. (He spoke with me on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of his mission.) His team is made up of about 30 troops from various countries focused on keeping Kabul safe. It\u2019s a difficult job made more difficult by the fact that Kabul\u2019s population has swelled to more than 5 million as the rural areas of Afghanistan have become more dangerous or fallen under control of the Taliban.\n\nWe were standing outside the Maiwand Wrestling Club in Kabul as the Special Operations officer described an attack that had killed 26 people in September 2018. The Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood on the western side of Kabul is home to the ethnic Hazara community, a mostly Shiite minority that has long been targeted by the Taliban and now the Islamic State. On that day in September, an Islamic State suicide bomber had climbed out of a car, taken a last drag off a cigarette and approached the gym. He shot a security guard at the gate and headed inside. When wrestling coach Maalim Abbas barred the steel-plated door to the gym, the bomber set off the device. The Special Operations officer pointed out the path the suicide bomber followed into the gym, the area of an outer wall where a gate used to be, and the location of a car that exploded after first responders arrived at the scene.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to execute a remote detonation,\u201d the officer said. \u201cEven a command detonation is hard. It takes some coordination.\u201d High-profile attacks like this one remind Afghan civilians that the government can\u2019t protect them, the officer explained.\n\nThe gym attack was just one example of the ever-present threat to Afghanistan posed by Islamic State-Khorasan Province, known as ISIS-K. ISIS-K arrived on the Afghan battlefield in 2014 \u2014 swearing allegiance to the core Islamic State in 2015. It\u2019s made up of splinter Taliban groups from Afghanistan and Pakistan that came together under the black flag of the Islamic State because they were disillusioned by the way the war was going. (Also, the Islamic State paid fighters more than the Taliban.) Once ISIS-K was born, the core organization provided them with rules and guidelines for building their caliphate. One American intelligence analyst compared joining the Islamic State to buying a McDonald\u2019s franchise: It\u2019s your store, but the golden arches are going to tell you how to run the place.\n\nISIS-K recruits are usually young men, educated believers with specific skills like video production or practicing medicine. If they don\u2019t have the skills, the Islamic State will send them to school for training. For example, the organization needed someone to run an X-ray machine, so it recruited a student and sent him to Kabul University to learn how to be an X-ray tech. Not only did recovered letters \u2014 with Islamic State letterhead \u2014 show how much the man was paid, but photos showed an X-ray machine in a village high in the mountains.\n\nUnlike al-Qaeda, the Islamic State is at odds with the Taliban. Since 2014, ISIS-K has fought against the Taliban as both groups vie for control over the insurgency against the Afghan government. Last year, the Taliban claimed it killed 153 ISIS-K fighters, wounded 100 and captured 134 in a campaign to clear northern Afghanistan of the group.\n\nWhile the Taliban and the United States have been talking peace, the ISIS-K threat has grown. And intelligence officials in Miller\u2019s headquarters fear peace will drive the Taliban\u2019s more fanatical fighters into ISIS-K\u2019s ranks. That\u2019s why the hope is that any troop drawdown won\u2019t include Special Operations teams working against the Islamic State. \u201cThe Taliban want Afghanistan,\u201d said the officer who explained the gym attack. \u201cThey want their country back. The Islamic State wants to change the world map.\u201d\n\nU.S. Army Gen. Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller before a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels in 2018.

(Andrew Quilty)\n\nV. Daikundi province, 2009\n\nThe Afghan war was never meant for huge, conventional units with tanks; it was always fought one village at a time, which is why the Special Forces\u2019 ability to build rapport with local leaders and Afghan soldiers was at a premium. They are among the Army\u2019s most highly trained soldiers. They might perform a raid with Afghan troops at night and then provide medical care to locals in a village the next morning.\n\nIn 2009, the Special Forces launched a countrywide strategy to win over the locals and try to create stability. The new strategy was called Village Stability Operations (VSO), and it thrust Special Forces teams into villages throughout Afghanistan to build local governance. This broke Special Forces out of the cycle of raids, in which U.S. troops were constantly hitting targets but rarely interacting with the populace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to kill the enemy, but that is not how we\u2019re going to win,\u201d then-Col. Don Bolduc told me in 2009 during one of our talks in his office at Camp Brown, in Kandahar. He served more than five years in Afghanistan and would retire as a brigadier general. \u201cThis is about mobilizing the populace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win by securing the populace and preventing the insurgents\u2019 negative influence.\u201d\n\nShortly after speaking to Bolduc, I got a firsthand look. A Special Forces team in Nili \u2014 a village in Daikundi, an isolated province in central Afghanistan \u2014 was attempting to build one of the first VSO sites, and the Army allowed me to embed with the group.\n\nThe roar of the engines surged as the CH-47 Chinook rose over a mountain and dipped into a valley on its way to Nili. A four-wheeler and pallets of supplies for a VSO team took up most of the deck. We descended into a clearing surrounded by massive mountains. When we landed, the helicopter\u2019s crew pushed the supplies off, and then the Special Forces team drove the four-wheeler toward its destination.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban want Afghanistan,\u201d one officer told me. \u201cThey want their country back. The Islamic State wants to change the world map.\u201d\n\nDaikundi was still a war zone, but no one was planning raids. I spent the next few days in a civilian truck riding from village to village and meeting with local leaders. The Special Forces team requested funding to repair schools, but they first had to inspect them to see what kinds of repairs were needed. The team also gave soccer balls to the police to give to kids. These kinds of missions were a far cry from searching for a Taliban commander. Same war, different way to fight it.\n\nA year later, Miller took over command of a unit focused on training local forces. \u201cWe are about to take community defense to the next level,\u201d he predicted, according to \u201cGame Changers,\u201d a 2015 book by Lt. Col. Scott Mann that chronicles the VSO strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s all about local stability, not just security. We have to get local governance right. It\u2019s also about connecting the villages to the rest of the government. What we are providing is a platform, something the rest of the coalition and Afghan government can connect to where they couldn\u2019t before \u2014 a village stability platform.\u201d\n\nSoon, not only were Special Forces teams involved, but so were SEALs and even conventional units. Petraeus made VSO part of his strategy and pushed units into more areas. Village Stability turned into 30,000 Afghan local police protecting more than 115 districts.\n\nAt the time, Mark, the Special Forces team commander in Nili \u2014 whose last name was withheld as part of the ground rules of my embed \u2014 embraced the mission. He, like Bolduc, had come to see the fallacy of constant raids. He told me that Special Forces had been too focused on fighting, that raids kill only the \u201cbranches\u201d of the insurgency. Victory was winning over people, and persuading them to reject the Taliban and rebuild their country. \u201cWe lost our way,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut have found it again.\u201d\n\nWith the shift to VSO, though, came a new challenge. Not many would-be soldiers sign up to dig wells. Most of the soldiers I spoke with \u2014 particularly conventional troops, but also some Special Forces \u2014 told me they came to Afghanistan to fight. The soldiers wanted to kick in doors and kill Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists, not spend hours training local police. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much love for this program early on,\u201d Mann writes in his book. \u201cMany Green Berets preferred to continue targeting extremists instead of living among locals.\u201d\n\nUltimately, corruption and cronyism, coupled with American impatience, crippled the program. VSO was eventually phased out. The U.S. special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction said in a May 2018 report that VSO had \u201cshowed early potential during the surge but deteriorated during transition as the program scaled too quickly.\u201d\n\nVSO wasn\u2019t a complete failure, though. John Friberg, a retired Special Forces soldier with four decades of service, argued in a 2016 analysis on the website SOF News that things could have turned out better: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the VSO program was not instituted earlier in the Afghan conflict; if it had a longer duration of operation the situation in Afghanistan might be very different today. \u2026 Overall, the Village Stability Operations program was a success where it was applied for the short duration of its existence.\u201d\n\nU.S. soldiers view Kabul from a Black Hawk helicopter in 2018.

Under the direction of Miller\u2019s team, Afghans have taken a step forward by creating the Afghan National Army Territorial Force (ANA-TF), inspired by the VSO program. Launched in February 2018, this initiative is truly Afghan-led \u2014 which is why American advisers didn\u2019t know what to expect when acting Afghan Defense Minister Asadullah Khalid and a small entourage of U.S. troops and Afghan officers went in January to an outpost to inspect one of the newest ANA-TF units.\n\nKhalid blew into his hands and rubbed them together as the Black Hawk flew past a snow-covered mountain on its way to Konar province, a mountainous area that hugs the border with Pakistan. The new effort aims to create a force to fill the vacuum after regular Afghan National Army units leave an area in their hunt for Taliban and Islamic State cells. Unlike ANA troops, who are recruited countrywide and often serve with units far from their hometowns, ANA-TF recruits come from, and serve in, the local community. They know the area and are literally fighting for their villages.\n\nUpon our arrival, 50 Afghan soldiers in formation greeted Khalid and his entourage, saluting as he walked down a red carpet to a fleet of waiting trucks. Soon after, the convoy tore down a dirt track, racing to a small outpost ringed by wire-framed baskets filled with sand that act as walls. Members of the ANA-TF, wearing new army uniforms, were waiting in formation. The company\u2019s commander welcomed Khalid to the outpost. He turned on his heel and goose-stepped back to the formation. Khalid followed and inspected the soldiers, stopping to talk with each one. \u201cYou are the people defending the country,\u201d Khalid told them over and over.\n\nVictory was winning over people, and persuading them to reject the Taliban and rebuild their country. \u201cWe lost our way,\u201d the commander said, \u201cbut have found it again.\u201d\n\nA Special Forces officer (who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the mission) and Rand researcher Rebecca Zimmerman are working with Afghans on the program. Wearing a black headscarf, Zimmerman stood to the side with the Afghan media and watched Khalid make his way down the line. \u201cI was pleased,\u201d she told me as we watched Khalid inspect the troops. \u201cThey looked a little polished, well-fed. You can\u2019t fake well-fed.\u201d\n\nAfter talking to commanders, Khalid climbed into a truck, and the convoy headed for a nearby village to visit the family of a fallen Afghan commando while Zimmerman and a delegation of Afghan generals and officials toured the outpost\u2019s barracks and kitchen area. The barracks floor sparkled, and every bed was made. The Afghan generals and officials didn\u2019t trust appearances, though; they pulled at the sheets and spent several minutes in the kitchen checking the food.\n\nZimmerman and the Special Forces officer were smiling when they returned to Kabul. \u201cYou take the wins when you can find them,\u201d the officer said. The best-case scenario, according to Zimmerman and the officer, is the creation of units funded by the Afghan government providing both local security and a connection to Kabul. The national government has trouble keeping a presence in the country\u2019s rural villages \u2014 something the ANA-TF can remedy.\n\nWhether the ANA-TF succeeds remains to be seen. But it\u2019s merely the latest attempt to solve a puzzle that, 18 years into the war, the American military has never quite mastered: how to train an Afghan military that is able to provide security without help.\n\nAn older resident of Istalif, an hour outside Kabul, in 2004.

No one represented Afghans in the minds of Americans more than former president Hamid Karzai. When I first saw pictures of him, I remember how regal he looked with his signature gray karakul hat and his colorful, striped chapan coat. Washington picked him after the fall of the Taliban to champion the resurrection of Afghanistan.\n\nIn January 2016, I went to interview Karzai in Kabul. I was working on a book about a former Afghan interpreter named Hikmatullah Shadman, who started a business and made millions before he was accused of corruption by the U.S. government. (He finally settled this past March, forfeiting $25 million, and his company admitted paying gratuities to two American soldiers.) I wanted to talk to Karzai \u2014 who had left the presidency in 2014 \u2014 about the case.\n\nAfter navigating a gauntlet of massive concrete walls and thick iron gates, I got to the final security check outside of his residence. I spotted Karzai in the courtyard, but his security ushered me into a waiting room outside his office. When I entered the room, an Afghan man \u2014 in his mid-30s and dressed in jeans, hiking boots and a red blazer \u2014 was sitting on the couch. I took a seat underneath a portrait of Ashraf Ghani, the current president. Shadman\u2019s American lawyer sat next to me. We waited a few minutes as aides walked in and out of the room, fixing us with curious glances.\n\nThe mid-30s Afghan asked me how many times I\u2019d met Karzai. I told him it was my first time. \u201cI\u2019ve met with him twice,\u201d he said. He was only in the city for a few days. He was originally from Kabul, was a graduate of a U.S. university and was now living in Australia. \u201cAny advice?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe smiled and said Karzai was very down-to-earth and well spoken, but he offered the lawyer and me a warning: \u201cHe has an established view of certain nationalities.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, but it was clear to me that being an American was no longer an asset with Karzai. His relationship with the U.S. government had started successfully, but it broke down during his reelection bid in 2009. By that point, American diplomats were tired of him and didn\u2019t hide the fact that they were rooting for his opponents.\n\nKarzai, even though he won, blamed voting irregularities on foreigners looking to install a \u201cpuppet government.\u201d And things would only get worse from there. Tensions between Karzai and the United States reached a boiling point after Staff Sgt. Robert Bales killed 16 unarmed Afghans in southern Afghanistan in 2012. When Karzai met with families of the victims, he prayed for Allah to \u201crescue us from these two demons,\u201d meaning the United States and the Taliban.\n\nOutside his office, we sat in silence for a few more minutes until a man in a suit took us into a meeting room with thick carpets and ornate but comfortable chairs. Karzai was standing in the middle of the room dressed in the traditional Afghan long shirt and baggy pants, with a coat pulled over his shirt. He was slight and balding but had a confident air about him.\n\nKarzai controlled the meeting from the start. He cared little about the case I wanted to talk to him about, except when he could use it to make his point. \u201cIf this was 2002, my gut feeling would have been in favor of the U.S. justice system,\u201d he said over sips of tea. Later, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve lost faith in the fairness of the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Karzai who is skeptical of America; many other Afghans feel the same way. \u201cOur future cannot be decided outside, whether in the capital cities of our friends, nemeses or neighbors,\u201d Ghani said after Eid prayers in August. \u201cThe fate of Afghanistan will be decided here in this homeland. We don\u2019t want anyone to intervene in our affairs.\u201d Perhaps Afghans have simply heard too many empty promises of victory and peace.\n\nA Shiite shrine in Jebrael in 2018. (Andrew Quilty)\n\nVIII. Kabul, 2019\n\nDuring my visit earlier this year, rumors of a peace deal had everyone in Resolute Support Headquarters waiting for an announcement from Qatar, where talks were being held. Toward the end of my last day with Miller\u2019s staff, details started to emerge: The Taliban would pledge not to allow terrorist groups to use Afghanistan to stage attacks, and the United States would agree to a troop withdrawal. Specifics were being worked out, but this seemed like the start of a framework for an agreement.\n\nNow, eight months later, Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy, is back at the bargaining table with Taliban negotiators to start a ninth round of talks. So far, no deal has been reached, but there have been reports that a bilateral U.S.-Taliban agreement is close to being struck. (Update: After this story went to press, a Taliban suicide bombing killed twelve, including one U.S. soldier. Subsequently, President Trump canceled previously unannounced talks with the Taliban that would have been held at Camp David.)\n\nPeace has risks, of course. The North Vietnamese agreed to a peace treaty in 1973 to end what was then America\u2019s longest war. By April 1975, they were on the outskirts of Saigon. South Vietnam pleaded for American help, but President Gerald Ford refused. Will something similar happen when the last U.S. troops leave Afghanistan, with the Islamic State or the Taliban playing the role of North Vietnam?\n\nIn January, standing in Resolute Headquarters, news from the peace talks felt like a genuine turning point. And yet, for nearly a decade, general after general had talked so often about turning a corner in Afghanistan that I\u2019d begun to ignore it. I told Miller I had a healthy skepticism about updates from Afghanistan. \u201cPeople are skeptical of things that look different, of promises of commanders that they\u2019re making progress here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I stated upfront was this conflict will end by a political solution. \u2026 The intra-Afghan fighting will have to end by a political solution. Neither side can win.\u201d\n\nBefore I left for my most recent trip, I called Bolduc, who told me, \u201cNobody has figured out anything.\u201d The retired Special Forces general lost 69 soldiers during his more than five years in Afghanistan. \u201cThe commitment of the president is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants out. I haven\u2019t seen a policy that supports one more casualty.\u201d\n\nThinking about the future of Afghanistan, my mind drifts back to my first mission with a Special Forces team. It was Sept. 11, 2004, and I was in one of two CH-47s with nearly two dozen Afghan militia and their Special Forces advisers. The helicopters landed outside of a village in Zabul province suspected of harboring Taliban fighters. I followed the men in front as they disappeared into the dust and headed toward cover. The radio squawked as soldiers sent updates. Taliban fighters were spotted running into the hills. Afghan militiamen cleared a nearby house and found weapons.\n\nToward the end of the mission as we waited for the helicopters to return, I was in the center of the village with the other Special Forces soldiers. All day, the locals \u2014 particularly the kids \u2014 watched us. A little girl in a red dress and bare feet kept smiling at one of the Special Forces soldiers. He\u2019d smile back, and she\u2019d giggle. Finally, the girl took a few steps forward. The Special Forces soldier \u2014 his helmet off but still clad in body armor, with a pistol strapped to his thigh \u2014 knelt to greet her. With his right hand, he offered her a piece of candy. She took a few steps closer, tentative at first, until she recognized the treat. Then she took it in her small hands, a smile crossing her lips.\n\nA photographer I was embedded with snapped a photo of that moment. It was a simple gesture that had played out in similar ways in so many wars that came before this one: the kind soldier reaching out to the child living through the ravages of war, her ability to trust still intact. For the few seconds that interaction transpired, I believed that Americans were providing the Afghan people \u2014 who\u2019d suffered for decades \u2014 a chance to live in peace. I\u2019ve been coming back to Afghanistan ever since, trying to recapture that same optimism: hope for the future of the country; hope \u2014 however fragile, however battered by the events of the past 18 years \u2014 that all the fighting and suffering and dying were not in vain.\n\nA soldier offers candy to a young Afghan girl in Zabul province in 2004.
