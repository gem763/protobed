Thom Tillis: Dems' strategy of personal destruction against Trump began with Brett Kavanaugh", "language": "en", "text": "Monday, October 7, marks one year since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. He is already proving to be a brilliant and fair-minded conservative jurist who follows the Constitution as written.\n\nWhile Kavanaugh will undoubtedly make his lasting mark on the Court in the coming decades, his confirmation process will, unfortunately, go down in history as one of the low points of American politics.\n\nIt will be remembered as the moment in which Democrats, starving for a political victory following their stunning defeat to President Trump in 2016, adopted a politics of personal destruction strategy, launching a highly coordinated smear campaign against the president\u2019s judicial nominee.\n\nGREGG JARRETT: THE PELOSI-SCHIFF 'WITCH HUNT' TO IMPEACH TRUMP IS AN ABUSE OF POWER\n\nAs a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was on the frontline throughout the entire confirmation process and was one of Kavanaugh\u2019s staunchest supporters.\n\nIt was surreal to see my Democratic colleagues abandon the basic tenants of due process, presuming Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent.\n\nEncouraged by their fanatical, left-wing base and a pliant media, no allegation was too far-fetched to embrace. They even sunk so low that they hyped up the egregiously false allegations made by the client of con-man lawyer Michael Avenatti. It was a disgrace.\n\nFortunately, their smear campaign failed. The truth prevailed and Kavanaugh was confirmed.\n\nFast forward to just a few weeks ago, when Democratic presidential candidates and mainstream media outlets pounced on a completely uncorroborated allegation against Kavanaugh published by The New York Times in the paper\u2019s Opinion section.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.\n\nDemocrats like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris rushed to call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. However, the American people soon learned that the authors conveniently left out vital exculpatory facts, forcing the New York Times to issue an editor\u2019s note correcting the story.\n\nWhile September may have started with Democrats\u2019 aiming their politics of personal destruction and calls for impeachment at Kavanaugh, it ended with them doing the same against President Trump.\n\nWe already know more about the facts of President Trump\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart than the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d did because we\u2019ve seen the transcript, unlike the individual who filed the complaint. The transcript directly contradicts the Democratic narrative that the president engaged in a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nThe latest impeachment push is already unfolding in a way that\u2019s eerily similar to the Kavanaugh spectacle, including Democrats knowing about the allegations before they were made public -- giving them time to create their narrative in advance.\n\nThis week the public learned that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his staff were working with the so-called whistleblower and encouraged him or her to file the complaint.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Democrats have already deemed the facts as irrelevant because their end game is removing President Trump from power using any means necessary.\n\nThey're not even trying to hide what their motivation is with Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, recently declaring on national television that \u201cI\u2019m concerned if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for an impeachment inquiry before she even saw the transcript of the president\u2019s call with the Ukrainian leader. And it\u2019s why Schiff tried to deceive the American public by reading a completely fabricated transcript to make the president look bad.\n\nDemocrats, including those running against me in North Carolina, are taking a page out of their Kavanaugh playbook by pushing impeachment because it\u2019s the only play they have left.\n\nAt the end of the day, Democrats know they can\u2019t beat President Trump on the issues the American people care about.\n\nThey know they can\u2019t beat President Trump by attacking his record of generating record economic growth, securing the border, appointing conservative judges, rebuilding our military, making major reforms to the VA and cutting taxes for hardworking Americans.\n\nThe only alternative Democrats are offering Americans is a radical liberal agenda that the American people refuse to buy.\n\nThey want to eliminate your employer-provided health insurance, increase the taxes on the money you worked hard for and even implement radical policies like the Green New Deal to prevent you from eating hamburgers and driving the cars you to want to drive.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDemocrats know they can\u2019t beat President Trump by running on the issues the American people care about, which is why they\u2019ve employed the politics of personal destruction designed to grind the president\u2019s policy initiatives to a halt, even as they admit that doing so will tear the country apart.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before. When the liberal mob threw mud to try to tank Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, we fought back with the truth and won.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow the liberal mob is back to take out President Trump by throwing more mud and pushing impeachment.\n\nOnce again, we will fight back with the facts and we will win.", "description": "Democrats know they can\u2019t beat President Trump by running on the issues the American people care about, which is why they\u2019ve employed the politics of personal destruction.", "authors": ["Thom Tillis", "Thom Tillis Is The United States Senator For North Carolina.
