But this is only one part of the solution.\n\n\u201cWe know that girls around the world are being held back because of their periods, whether that's the one in five girls here in the UK who are bullied and teased, girls in Zimbabwe who have dropped out of school because the recent cyclone destroyed their period-friendly toilets, or those living in refugee camps in Bangladesh who can't access period products since fleeing their homes.\n\n\"Period poverty will not stop until we fix the toxic trio of affordability of products, lack of education and period shame. We hope this emoji helps to keep the conversation going.\"\n\nThe software update also includes the introduction of Apple's new Deep Fusion photography technology, which uses machine learning to take and quickly analyse multiple photos before piecing together the best parts into a single image.\n\nA new privacy control which enables users to opt-out of allowing Apple to store interactions with its voice assistant Siri has also been introduced.\n\niPhone and iPad users can access the new emoji by opening their Settings app, selecting General and then Software Update before confirming the installation of iOS 13.2.", "description": "Apple has launched a host of new emoji, including more inclusive options such as gender-neutral characters and people with disabilities.
