That ended up making me very sick,' Zoe explained.\n\n'I feel like pretty much all women feel that way, even the women who take maternity leave get partway through and feel a massive identity crisis,' she continued.\n\nZoe went on to say that Instagram trolls criticise her for her parenting choices, as they too, struggle to find a balance between motherhood and career.\n\nPost-natal depletion diagnosis is a condition where mothers feel the strain of modern parenthood, and can lead to poor immune function and gut health.\n\nThe TV and radio personality explained: '[I was trying] to prove to everyone that I wasn't just a mum, I was still of importance outside of being a mum, I still had my identity'\n\nIt is different to postpartum depression - a depression that comes on within a year of giving birth and may include feelings of inadequacy and guilt and panic attacks.\n\nThis is not the first time Zoe has opened up on her struggles with post-natal depletion.\n\nTaking to Instagram in September last year for RUOK Day, Zoe wrote: 'I have to be honest.

Everything else fell away. Not talking to anyone about it.'\n\n'I can't believe how happy I finally feel... Was it post-natal depression? I don't know. I do know as a woman and mother I put way too much pressure on myself,' she added.\n\nZoe wed NRL Wests Tigers star Benji Marshall, 34, at a private estate in Byron Bay back in 2013, and welcomed son Benjamin Fox in March last year.\n\nIf you're struggling or know of someone who is, please call Lifeline on 13 11 14.", "description": "She returned to work just four weeks after giving birth to son Benjamin Fox in March last year.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/13/19955308-0-image-a-58_1571574006457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
