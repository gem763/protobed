It seems half the gaming industry (to say nothing of the wider tech industry) has gotten caught up in the ensuing fallout \u2014 and now Riot Games is downright begging its esports pros not to drag them into it.\n\nJohn Needham, head of Riot Games\u2019 League of Legends esports division, issued a statement on the official LoL esports Twitter account stating the company has asked its esports pros and commentators to \u201ckeep personal views on sensitive issues (political, religious, or otherwise) separate.\u201d Read the entire statement below:\n\nA message from John Needham, Global Head of League of Legends Esports pic.twitter.com/5Au9rE7T86 \u2014 lolesports (@lolesports) October 11, 2019\n\nOn an ordinary day, this wouldn\u2019t be a big ask \u2014 it\u2019d seem entirely reasonable. But given that the gaming world is boiling with rage over how Blizzard handled its Blitzchung/Hong Kong controversy earlier this week, it seems less a generic rule and more of specific plea to not deliberately involve League of Legends in the mess.\n\nBlizzard\u2019s reason for banning Ng Wai \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Chung was that he voiced his support on an official Blizzard livestream of the Hearthstone Grandmasters tourney. Needless to say, it wasn\u2019t a sanctioned utterance \u2014 the Taiwanese casters interviewing him appeared shocked and dove under the table when he said it. Blizzard stated that esports pros weren\u2019t allowed to say anything that might reflect poorly on the company on their official platforms. What they say on their own time is their business, at least in theory. This \u2014 speaking about personal beliefs on official channels \u2014 appears to be what Riot\u2019s trying to avoid.\n\nOf course, gamers instead saw Blizzard\u2019s move as an attempt to placate the Chinese government, upon whose goodwill many, many game publishers rely to retain access to their Chinese gaming audiences. The fact that Virtual and Mr. Yee, the casters, were fired shortly after despite not having acknowledged Blitzchung\u2019s invective (Virtual told PC Gamer that Blizzard didn\u2019t tell them why they were shown the proverbial door), strengthened the impression of political cleanup.\n\nBlizzard continues to take heat over this decision. Several popular Hearthstone casters have quit in protest, and employees staged a walk-out earlier this week. Fellow publisher Epic Games threw some shade at them when CEO Tim Sweeney told The Verge Epic would never ban a Fortnite esports pro from speaking their mind. Blizzard\u2019s own characters are being turned into symbols of the protest.\n\nGiven everything that\u2019s happened to Blizzard, one of the only companies that can rival Riot in the ubiquity of its esports scene, its\u2019 probably not a surprise the latter wants no part of it.\n\n(via Kotaku)", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2FLeague-of-Legends-hed.jpg&signature=dce78b4c5b1b54b89cc0e8baad404074", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
