White is currently plying his trade in Melbourne grade cricket, while 23-year-old Salt was one of the leading run scorers in this year\u2019s English Vitality Blast, amassing 406 runs at 36.9 for Sussex with a strike rate of 161. Last year\u2019s international batsman Colin Ingram has been let go. Travis Head could play plenty of games after being dropped from the Test squad for the final Ashes match. Afghani spinner Rashid Khan remains the team\u2019s talisman with the ball.\n\nBRISBANE HEAT\n\nTom Banton (England, first eight games)\n\nMax Bryant\n\nJoe Burns\n\nBen Cutting\n\nAB De Villiers (South Africa, replacement international player, last six games and finals)\n\nSam Heazlett\n\nZahir Khan (Afghanistan, replacement international player)\n\nMarnus Labuschagne\n\nJosh Lalor\n\nChris Lynn\n\nJames Pattinson\n\nJames Peirson\n\nJack Prestwidge\n\nMatt Renshaw\n\nMark Steketee\n\nMitch Swepson\n\nMujeeb Ur Rahman (Afghanistan)\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nIn: AB De Villiers (South Africa), Zahir Khan (Afghanistan), Tom Banton (England)\n\nOut: Brendon McCullum (retired), Brendan Doggett (likely Thunder), Alex Ross (Thunder)\n\nExpected to earn roster spot: Matthew Kuhnemann\n\nAnalysis: The Heat have pulled off one of the biggest signings in Big Bash history by snaring South African superstar AB De Villiers. He is available for the last six games of the regular season and finals. He averaged 69.8 and had a strike rate of 182 for Middlesex in the Vitality Blast. Coach Darren Lehmann has been very active in the international market, also snaring highly rated English youngster Tom Banton (first eight games) and Afghani spinners Zahir Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman. Chris Lynn will again lead the batting, but his \u201cBash Brother\u201d Brendon McCullum has retired.\n\nHOBART HURRICANES\n\nQais Ahmad (Afghanistan)\n\nJofra Archer (England)\n\nGeorge Bailey\n\nJames Faulkner\n\nJarrod Freeman\n\nCaleb Jewell\n\nBen McDermott\n\nRiley Meredith\n\nTom Rogers\n\nD\u2019Arcy Short\n\nAaron Summers\n\nMatthew Wade\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nIn: Nil\n\nOut: Johan Botha (retired), Tymal Mills (unsigned), Tim Paine, Clive Rose, Lawrence Neil-Smith\n\nExpected to earn roster spots: Jake Doran, Simon Milenko, David Moody, Scott Boland (Stars)\n\nAnalysis: Ashes hero Jofra Archer remains on the books for now, but his rapid rise through the international ranks means he\u2019s likely unavailable due to England duty. The Canes still have plenty of roster spots to fill, but it\u2019s already clear their batting will revolve around D\u2019Arcy Short. Matthew Wade is expected to miss the first half of the tournament due to Test duty. Afghani leggie Qais Ahmad has signed a new deal after impressing in his brief appearances last summer.\n\nMELBOURNE RENEGADES\n\nCameron Boyce\n\nDan Christian\n\nTom Cooper\n\nZak Evans\n\nAaron Finch\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk\n\nHarry Gurney (England)\n\nSam Harper\n\nMarcus Harris\n\nMackenzie Harvey\n\nJon Holland\n\nShaun Marsh\n\nJoe Mennie\n\nMohammad Nabi (Afghanistan)\n\nKane Richardson\n\nWill Sutherland\n\nBeau Webster\n\nJack Wildermuth\n\nSUPERCOACH BBL LAUNCHES 30 OCT!!!\n\nIn: Shaun Marsh (Scorchers)\n\nOut: Cameron White (Strikers), Usman Khan Shinwari (Pakistan), Chris Tremain (Thunder), Tim Ludeman, Andrew Fekete, Kelvin Smith, Mitchell Perry\n\nExpected to earn roster spot: Andre Russell (West Indies)\n\nAnalysis: The signing of Shaun Marsh from the Scorchers is a huge boost for the Renegades. Statistically, Marsh is an all-time great of BBL, averaging 49.48 over his career. His international commitments appear over and Marsh is therefore likely to be available for the entire season, injury permitting. English death bowling specialist Harry Gurney is back for another season, while Afghanistan\u2019s Mohammad Nabi is the other international. Australian short-form captain Aaron Finch is available for the start of the tournament before heading to India with the ODI side. There is speculation West Indian superstar Andre Russell will join the squad.\n\nMELBOURNE STARS\n\nHilton Cartwright\n\nJackson Coleman\n\nNathan Coulter-Nile\n\nBen Dunk\n\nSeb Gotch\n\nPeter Handscomb\n\nClint Hinchliffe\n\nSandeep Lamichhane (Afghanistan)\n\nNic Maddinson\n\nGlenn Maxwell\n\nJonathan Merlo\n\nLance Morris\n\nDale Steyn (South Africa, first six games)\n\nMarcus Stoinis\n\nDaniel Worrall\n\nAdam Zampa\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nIn: Dale Steyn (South Africa), Hilton Cartwright (Scorchers), Nathan Coulter-Nile (Scorchers), Clint Hinchliffe (Scorchers)\n\nOut: Dwayne Bravo (retired), Jackson Bird (Sixers), Liam Plunkett (England), Michael Beer, Scott Boland, Liam Bowe, Travis Dean, Evan Gulbis\n\nExpected to earn roster spots: Nick Larkin, Tom O\u2019Connell\n\nAnalysis: The signing of South African superstar Dale Steyn is a huge coup for last season\u2019s runner up, although he\u2019s only available for the first six games. Australian one-day squad member Nathan Coulter-Nile is a key addition from the Scorchers to fill the bowling all-rounder role vacated by departing West Indian Dwayne Bravo. Australian short-form representatives Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Peter Handscomb, Adam Zampa and Coulter-Nile are available for the first few rounds before heading to India for an ODI series, then returning for later rounds.\n\nPERTH SCORCHERS\n\nAshton Agar-agar\n\nFawad Ahmed\n\nCameron Bancroft\n\nJason Behrendorff\n\nCameron Green\n\nAaron Hardie\n\nNick Hobson\n\nJosh Inglis\n\nMatthew Kelly\n\nMitchell Marsh\n\nJoel Paris\n\nKurtis Patterson\n\nJhye Richardson\n\nAshton Turner\n\nAndrew Tye\n\nSam Whiteman\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nIn: Fawad Ahmed (Thunder), Kurtis Patterson (Thunder)\n\nOut: Usman Qadir (Pakistan), David Willey (England), Hilton Cartwright (Stars), Nathan Coulter-Nile (Stars), Michael Klinger (retired), Shaun Marsh (Renegades), Clint Hinchcliffe (Stars), Will Bosisto, Liam Guthrie, Sean Terry\n\nAnalysis: Shaun Marsh, Michael Klinger, Nathan Coulter-Nile and Hilton Cartwright are huge omissions. Fawad Ahmed is the main recruit and will form a formidable spin partnership with Ashton Agar. Jhye Richardson and AJ Tye headline a strong pace attack, although the injury to Jason Behrendorff (stress fracture in back) is a huge blow. Perth have plenty of hitting power in the middle order with Australian representatives Ashton Turner and Mitchell Marsh. They lack quality top order batsmen, but with two international slots still to fill, expect them to recruit heavily.\n\nSYDNEY SIXERS\n\nSean Abbott\n\nJustin Avendano\n\nJackson Bird\n\nTom Curran (England)\n\nBen Dwarshuis\n\nJack Edwards\n\nMickey Edwards\n\nDaniel Fallins\n\nMoises Henriques\n\nDaniel Hughes\n\nNathan Lyon\n\nPeter Nevill\n\nStephen O\u2019Keefe\n\nJosh Philippe\n\nLloyd Pope\n\nJordan Silk\n\nHenry Thornton\n\nJames Vince (England)\n\nTBC\n\nIn: Jackson Bird (Stars)\n\nOut: Joe Denly (England), Greg West, Oliver Davies, Ben Manenti\n\nAnalysis: Not a great deal of movement at the Sixers with Jackson Bird the only signing so far, returning to his home state. The side will have a distinctly English flavour yet again with James Vince and Tom Curran confirmed as internationals. Veterans Sean Abbott and Stephen O\u2019Keefe will lead the attack, while the Sixers also possess two of the most exciting young spinners in Australia in Lloyd Pope and Daniel Fallins. Young keeper-batsman Josh Philippe has been tipped by many, including Shane Warne, for a national call-up this summer.\n\nSYDNEY THUNDER\n\nSquad:\n\nJonathan Cook\n\nOliver Davies\n\nCallum Ferguson\n\nMatt Gilkes\n\nChris Green\n\nAlex Hales (England)\n\nUsman Khawaja\n\nJay Lenton\n\nNathan McAndrew\n\nChris Morris (South Africa)\n\nArjun Nair\n\nAlex Ross\n\nDaniel Sams\n\nGurinder Sandhu\n\nJason Sangha\n\nChris Tremain\n\nTBC\n\nTBC\n\nSUPERCOACH BBL LAUNCHES 30 OCT!!!\n\nIn: Alex Hales (England), Chris Morris (South Africa), Alex Ross (Heat), Chris Tremain (Renegades), Oliver Davies\n\nOut: Jos Buttler (England), Joe Root (England), Chris Jordan (England), Fawad Ahmed (Scorchers), Pat Cummins (Australia), Shane Watson (retired), Kurtis Patterson (Scorchers), Ryan Gibson, Liam Hatcher, Sam Rainbird, Anton Devcich, Baxter Holt\n\nExpected to earn roster spot: Brendan Doggett (Heat)\n\nAnalysis: Huge losses for the Thunder with Jos Buttler (England), Pat Cummins (Australia), Fawad Ahmed (Scorchers), Chris Jordan (England), Shane Watson (retired), Joe Root (England) and Kurtis Patterson (Scorchers) out the door. They have therefore been active in the player market and recruited two T20 guns-for-hire in Alex Hales (England) and Chris Morris (South Africa). Usman Khawaja\u2019s axing from the Test team means he could be available for the entire tournament. New-ball specialist Chris Tremain may prove an astute signing from the Renegades. He has played for Australia before but is unlikely for a national call-up this year, meaning he\u2019ll be available for the entire tournament.", "description": "This season\u2019s Big Bash will be the most star-studded in history with AB De Villiers, Dale Steyn and potentially Andre Russell among the star signings.", "authors": ["Tom Sangster"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6f9e82aeedf062b3baa97311ba5ff16c?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
