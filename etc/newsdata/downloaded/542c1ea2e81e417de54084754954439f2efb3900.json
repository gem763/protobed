She was charged with a felony for making a terrorist threat against the school.\n\n\"This is probably everybody's biggest fear in the United States right now -- a school shooting,\" Pittsburg County Sheriff Chris Morris told ABC News in an interview Tuesday. \"Lots of people don't want to acknowledge that this, an active shooter or school violence, is probably the biggest threat in America right now.\"\n\nHe said he was proud of his deputies for acting fast on the claims because all threats of this nature must be taken seriously in today's climate.\n\nPittsburg County Sheriffs Office via AP\n\n\"There's no time to sit around and wait on it. I don't want one of my schools in my county shot up. I don't want anybody hurt,\" he said. \"So when I got the information, I spoke with my deputies and I told them not to go home until they had it resolved and taken care of.\"\n\nOfficials at McAlester High School said Wilson dropped out during her freshman year and had previously been suspended for bringing a knife to school and having a swastika symbol on her belongings, investigators said.\n\nWilson told police that she had recently completed a program at a camp for troubled youth and tried to enroll back into McAlester High School, but they didn't allow her to, according to the incident report.\n\nKTUL\n\nInvestigators said she seemed \"very upset\" about not being allowed to return to school, but she denied being mad about it. She said she was previously angry about being bullied by other students, but not anymore.\n\n\"Alexis also then stated to me that she used to be suicidal and border line homicidal to the people of Mcalester School because she was bullied,\" one of the arresting officers wrote in the incident report. \"I asked Alexis if she had thought about hurting anyone at the school and she stated not recently but she has in the past.\"\n\nWilson was being held on $250,000 bond at the Pittsburg County Jail as of late Tuesday. She pleaded not guilty at her arraignment on Monday and is scheduled to appear in court again on Sept. 27.", "description": "She told coworkers that she purchased a AK-47 and had the urge to shoot people.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/tulsa-1-abc-er-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
