(Susan Walsh, File)\n\nWhen the New York Times revealed a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh this weekend, the political world was again thrown into turmoil. Democrats, including several presidential candidates, called for further investigations and impeachment, while President Trump and top Republicans staunchly defended the embattled judge.\n\nBut amid that furor, the Times also weathered fierce criticism over how it framed the news and promoted it on social media. On Sunday, the newspaper apologized for a tweet that said the type of a misconduct claim against Kavanaugh \u201cmay seem like harmless fun\u201d and updated the article to reflect that the woman at the center of the latest allegation reportedly does not recall the incident.\n\nThe Times wrote that the tweet \u201cwas clearly inappropriate and offensive. We apologize for it and are reviewing the decision-making with those involved.\u201d\n\nDrawing on reporting from an upcoming book by two Times reporters, Saturday\u2019s piece focused largely on Deborah Ramirez, who came forward last year to accuse the Supreme Court justice of exposing himself to her during a dorm party at Yale University in the 1980s. The article was published in the Times\u2019 Opinion section and titled, \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, the writers said they corroborated Ramirez\u2019s account with at least seven witnesses and also uncovered an allegation that Kavanaugh displayed inappropriate behavior toward another woman in college. A classmate named Max Stier alleged that he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different dorm party, where friends pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hand of a female student there. The reporters wrote that senators and the FBI were aware of Stier\u2019s claim, but the FBI did not investigate. (Last year, The Washington Post independently confirmed that lawmakers and authorities knew of the claim, but did not publish a story because the alleged witnesses were not identified and the woman said to be involved declined to comment.)\n\nKavanaugh has denied the previously reported allegations and declined to speak with the Times about the newly surfaced account.\n\n[Democratic candidates demand Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment after new allegation in Times piece]\n\nBacklash against the Times came shortly after the publication\u2019s opinion account tweeted out the story with a message that read in part, \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken party may seem like harmless fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is \u2026 such a profound lapse in judgment and common sense,\u201d tweeted author Roxane Gay. \u201cWhat the hell is going on at the NYT?\u201d\n\nThis is.... such a profound lapse in judgment and common sense.

A culture of \u201charmless fun\u201d with those in positions of power poking fun at the pain while tearing open the wounds. \u2014 Chasten Buttigieg (@Chas10Buttigieg) September 15, 2019\n\nThe tweet also earned a rebuke from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) daughter, Christine Pelosi.\n\n\u201cWho thought an act of sexual assault was \u2018harmless fun\u2019 @nytopinion?\u201d Pelosi tweeted. \u201cFor the safety of their colleagues @nytimes HR should investigate.\u201d\n\nLike many others, Pelosi\u2019s criticism went beyond the tweet as she called attention to the article\u2019s content and presentation. Commentators wondered why the headline lacked any mention of the new allegation and instead appeared to frame the piece as an examination of Yale\u2019s campus culture in the 1980s. Stier\u2019s account, critics noted, was first mentioned in the article\u2019s 11th paragraph.\n\n\u201cYou buried the lede: @FBI failed to investigate credible charges of assault by a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d Pelosi tweeted.\n\nAsk yourself why the @NYTimes decided to break news about a new Kavanaugh abuse allegation in the 11th paragraph of a feature/opinion story, and not as a hard news lede on the front page.\n\n\n\nThe revelation is trending on Twitter & other social media. At @NYTimes? Not so much. \u2014 TimKarr (@TimKarr) September 15, 2019\n\nOthers zeroed in on the headline.\n\n\u201cThe whole framing of the NYT article - as a story about a middle-class girl struggling to have a place among the rich privileged kids at Yale, instead of we found corroborating evidence that a Supreme Court \u2018Justice\u2019 is a serial sexual abuser - is odd and infuriating,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\nThe NYT tweet about the Kavanaugh bombshell is very bad but so too is the editors' framing of the piece as being about the culture on the Yale campus rather than leading with the actual news that a) Debbie Ramirez' claims are corroborated and b) there was another incident. \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) September 15, 2019\n\nAnother person wrote that it seemed like the Times was trying to \u201cdiminish\u201d its \u201cbombshell reporting\u201d with \u201csoft cultural context.\u201d\n\nit is like they are trying to kind of diminish with soft cultural context the news part of it \u2014 Laura Rozen (@lrozen) September 15, 2019\n\nThe backlash prompted the Times to issue a series of tweets from its official public relations account Sunday afternoon, explaining that the news was part of book excerpt published in the Sunday Review, a section that \u201cfrequently runs excerpts of books produced by Times reporters.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt of the book was published in the Sunday Review, a section that includes both news analysis and opinion pieces. The section frequently runs excerpts of books produced by Times reporters. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cThe new revelations contained in the piece were uncovered during the reporting process for the book, which is why this information did not appear in The Times before the excerpt,\u201d the Times tweeted.\n\nIn another post, the Times reiterated its apology for the tweet.\n\nAlso, a tweet that went out from the @NYTOpinion account yesterday was clearly inappropriate and offensive. We apologize for it and are reviewing the decision-making with those involved. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nLate Sunday, an editor\u2019s note also appeared at the bottom of the article informing readers that part of the book\u2019s reporting on the new allegation against Kavanaugh had been left out.\n\n\u201cThe book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident,\u201d the note said. \u201cThat information has been added to the article.\u201d\n\nThat update fueled criticism from conservatives who had slammed the article as a \u201csmear\u201d on Kavanaugh.\n\nBOMBSHELL: New York Times corrects Kavanaugh smear to note alleged victim does not recall any such incident. pic.twitter.com/yigeOyOCzo \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 16, 2019\n\nIn recent months, the Times has faced scrutiny over editorial decisions and its staffers\u2019 social media interactions. The newspaper amended a front-page headline about Trump following mass outcry in August. That same month, the Times\u2019s Washington editor, Jonathan Weisman, was demoted after sparking controversy with tweets that were denounced as racist and columnist Bret Stephens was widely panned for his role in the now-infamous \u201cbed bug\u201d exchange.", "description": "The Saturday tweet read in part, \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken party may seem like harmless fun.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
