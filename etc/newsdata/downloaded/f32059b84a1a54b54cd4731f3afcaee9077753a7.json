After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!

Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.
