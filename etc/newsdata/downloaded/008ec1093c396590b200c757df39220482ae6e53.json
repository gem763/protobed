What\u2019s more, it has limitations that keep the stories from seeming too believable.\n\nBut many of the researchers who developed the technology, and people who have studied it, fear that as such tools get more advanced, they could spread misinformation or advance a political agenda. That\u2019s why some are sounding the alarm about the risks of computer-generated articles\u2014and releasing tools that let people ferret out potentially fake stories.\n\n\u201cThe danger is when there is already a lot of similar propaganda written by humans from which these neural language models can learn to generate similar articles,\u201d says Yejin Choi, an associate professor at the University of Washington, a researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and part of a team that developed a fake-news tool. \u201cThe quality of such neural fake news can look quite convincing to humans.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
