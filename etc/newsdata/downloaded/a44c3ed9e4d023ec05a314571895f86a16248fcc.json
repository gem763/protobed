I\u2019ve been married for 30 years. We have a son, 28 and a daughter, 24, who have both moved out.\n\nA few months ago, our son received a message on Facebook, out of the blue. It was from a woman living in London, who claimed to be his half-sister \u2014 and my husband her father.\n\nAn anonymous reader asked TV's Steph and Dom Parker for advice on how to deal with her husband's love-child, who has just appeared after 30 years of marriage (Stock image)\n\nIt was such a shock. But then I saw my husband\u2019s face and I knew she was telling the truth. He\u2019d had an affair with a woman from work \u2014 back when our son was very young. We had been through a rough patch at the time. He started seeing someone \u2014 and they had a daughter. My husband claims not to have known about this at the time, but my trust in him has been destroyed.\n\nMy son says we must build a relationship with this girl. But I don\u2019t know if I can. I loved my life, but I feel as though I\u2019m living a nightmare now.\n\nSTEPH SAYS:\n\nLet\u2019s get straight to the point and not sugar-coat anything. This is too important for fluffy words and platitudes. We both know you cannot go back to the way life was before. Your pain is justifiable: you are going through a bereavement of sorts.\n\nThis is too complex to tackle in one go, so let\u2019s break it down into sections that are more manageable for you.\n\nTaking control this will give you back your very self. I cannot begin to imagine the range and depth of your feelings, so we must try to find a way for you to take charge of them.\n\nShe said that they have two children together, a 28-year-old son and 24-year-old daughter, and that her husband has admitted to having an affair at work (Stock image)\n\nWhat happens now will determine the rest of your life. And your family\u2019s. They will be waiting for your reaction and take their cue from you. You say you loved the way your life was \u2014 do remember that. Now is probably not the time to go all Boudicca on everyone, tempting as that may be.\n\nWhat your husband did was appalling, but sadly middle-aged infidelity is surprisingly common. You also mention your marriage went through a rocky patch. All marriages have them. Men slip down the pecking order after kids. It happens. And if there hadn\u2019t been a child, then you\u2019d never have known, and everything would\u2019ve carried on as it was.\n\nInstead, your world has been turned upside down. You probably feel as though you don\u2019t know your husband, so deep is his deception.\n\nThis is too complex to tackle in one go, so let\u2019s break it down into sections that are more manageable for you\n\nHowever, certain questions must be asked: Why he didn\u2019t tell you? Did he really not know of her existence? Or have there been regular payments along the way? You also need to manage yourself while doing this. Please do not fold into the temptation of being highly emotional. You must remain calm and methodical and make it clear that this is not a discussion\u2014 you are driving this.\n\nHe absolutely must be honest with you now. Further down the line, it may be helpful, to be guided by a marriage counsellor, but not now.\n\nInclude your children in this \u2014 they will need support to process this, too. As painful as it is for you, you must support your son in his decision to see this girl. It is his choice to make.\n\nAs for your marriage, that is your choice to make. If you decide you cannot move forward with your husband, then make a graceful exit. Leave with compassion. It is essential to feel good about yourself at the end of this.\n\nYou are the matriarch of your clan. You hold all the cards right now, but you also hold everyone\u2019s hearts in your hands \u2014 be gentle with them.\n\nDom says:\n\nHow utterly hideous for you. I understand you must feel that your whole world has fallen apart. Not only have you discovered your husband was unfaithful, you\u2019ve also discovered he has another child, and that your children have another sibling.\n\nI think the first thing to address here is the most important \u2014 the other child. I\u2019m sure that, for you, this young woman is nothing more than an acid bath of a memory of deception.\n\nHer very existence is a reminder of your husband\u2019s faithlessness. But, I implore you, please do not show your anger or bitterness to her. It is not her fault. She has not acted improperly by contacting her brother. She has a right to know her father and her siblings.\n\nDom (pictured) said the key thing here is not to show anger or bitterness towards the love child as it is not their fault at all\n\nAnd I use the term siblings deliberately. My father had two children 20 years after he had me, and while we don\u2019t share the same mother, to me they are, absolutely, my brother and sister \u2014 no halves about it \u2014 and have brought me all the joy those words imply.\n\nLet your son (and your daughter, too, should she wish) build a relationship with his sister. You do not have to get to know her yourself, although it\u2019s possible that in the future you will choose to do so. It is enough that you don\u2019t stand in your son\u2019s way. His desire to know his sister is not a betrayal.\n\nI implore you, please do not show your anger or bitterness to her. It is not her fault\n\nThe betrayal is your husband\u2019s, and I would imagine it is no less devastating for being 20 years ago than if it were yesterday.\n\nI know that if Steph or I were to be unfaithful, it would ruin both of our lives. There would be no second chances. No patching things up. But many people believe that it can be done. That everyone is entitled to screw things up once. And if you feel able to do so, then you could try to forgive. The important thing to remember is that early marriage is a difficult time. No one admits it, but a baby almost always equals a lonely and neglected husband who misses his wife.\n\nI\u2019m not seeking to justify it, but I am trying to explain why your husband may have strayed. What he should have done, of course, is to take it on the chin and wait for your attention to return to him, but he failed.\n\nHe must not fail now. If he is to regain your trust, he must do everything necessary to make you feel secure in his love. Do you believe he didn\u2019t know about his daughter until now? I\u2019m not sure I buy that. DNA tests existed 20 years ago, after all.\n\nAsk him again to tell you everything. Then start to rebuild your life \u2014 in whichever direction you think best.", "description": "An anonymous reader said that after 30 years of marriage and two children,  son aged 28 and daughter aged 24, her husband's love-child has appeared.
