The number increased by more than 300,000 for a second straight month after August\u2019s 452,000.\n\nOn paper, the employment rate stood at 61.5 percent, up 0.3 percentage points on-year and a 23-year high for September.\n\nBut most of this increase was among elderly workers in short-term employment. The number of employed people over 60 increased by a whopping 380,000 on-year.\n\nIn contrast, employed people in their 40s and 30s, the mainstay of the economy, dwindled by 179,000 and 13,000, continuing a 24-month decline.\n\nThe number of employed people working fewer than 36 hours per week soared by 737,000 or 16.3 percent last month. People working a lot less or between just one to 17 hours per week increased by 371,000 or 24.5 percent.\n\nMeanwhile the number of those working more than 36 hours per week plunged by 452,000 or two percent.\n\nThe government nonetheless claimed that employment is improving both quantitatively and qualitatively, though Vice Finance Minister Kim Yong-beom admitted that \"uncertainty still exists in the employment environment.\"", "description": "Only Short-Term Employment Increases", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
