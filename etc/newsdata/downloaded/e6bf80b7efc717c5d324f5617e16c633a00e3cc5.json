Raina Telgemeier\n\nRaina Telgemeier struggles to find the right words when she tries to describe the sinking, claustrophobic sensation of having a panic attack. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of difficult to talk about,\u201d she said.\n\nBut when she started drawing \u201cGuts,\u201d her new graphic memoir about the origins of her anxiety, she found she could convey the feeling through drawing.\n\n\u201cComics are great because you don't always have to talk with words,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can talk with pictures and symbols, you can use color, you can use lines, you can use the medium to push ideas without having to fully explain them.\u201d\n\nIn one arresting sequence of images in \u201cGuts,\u201d Telgemeier shows herself as a girl, struggling to talk about her fears in a therapy session and using a scale of 1 to 10 to rate her anxiety.\n\nTelgemeier explains how she uses imagery and color to illustrate her experience of anxiety. \u201cYoung Raina is slipping and falling and losing her grasp. I illustrated every stage without using description, instead using the character\u2019s face and body language. Then my colorist found a way to take this scene from really neutral blue to a sickly green to black.\u201d \u201cAnd when you turn the page, she\u2019s describing her own anxiety in the moment: a five. Then thinking about her own anxiety makes her stomach hurt and her scale goes up. We transition back into the sickly green.\u201d \u201cYou see lines of pain and you see her feet standing on a spider web. I think that\u2019s how it feels, like you're standing on something that's so delicate and so fragile and it\u2019s wobbling and you could collapse at any time. You're hanging on to the web, desperately trying not to fall.\u201d \u201cAnd in this scene she does fall. She's falling into a void and all you hear is the therapist's voice saying, try, try to come back\u2026\u201d \u201c...try to grasp onto something and ground yourself.\u201d\n\nTelgemeier, 42, has built a fan base among young readers with her graphic novels and memoirs, including \u201cSisters,\u201d a coming-of-age story about a fraught sibling relationship and an excruciating family road trip, and \u201cSmile,\u201d which chronicles her long and painful dental reconstruction following an accident that smashed her front teeth.\n\n\u201cGuts,\u201d which Scholastic released in September, with a print run of one million copies, is her most personal book yet. It tells the story of how, as a child, she developed an intense fear of getting sick and vomiting. It\u2019s a phobia that she still grapples with.\n\n\u201cIllustrating this experience isn\u2019t easy,\u201d she said. \u201cI really have to put myself back into the feeling and my own fear.\u201d\n\nTelgemeier grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eldest of three children. Her parents encouraged her creative streak \u2014 she inherited her love of comics from her father, a writer, professor and editor who gave her the dystopian manga series \u201cBarefoot Gen\u201d as a gift.\n\nShe started drawing comics when she was 9, copying characters from her favorite animated movies and TV shows and from the comic strips she read in her local newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle. By the time she was 12 or 13, she settled into her own style, and recorded her experiences in a comics diary, which she kept throughout her teens and early 20s.\n\nTelgemeier\u2019s depiction of her own childhood drawings in \u201cGuts.\u201d Raina Telgemeier\n\nAt first, drawing was something she did for herself. Later, as a student at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, she discovered there was an audience for her work. She started self-publishing and selling mini-comics, mostly autobiographical short stories. In art school, some teachers and fellow students dismissed her illustrations as unsophisticated.\n\n\u201cMy style was still rooted in Disney cartoons and the Sunday funnies,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a bit of snooty pushback saying, Well, maybe this is immature.\u201d\n\nBut others saw emotional depth and sophistication in her stories. Her work impressed David Saylor, then a creative director at Scholastic, the children\u2019s book publishing house, which was preparing to start an imprint for graphic novels and comics. In 2004, Scholastic hired Telgemeier to illustrate the graphic novel adaptations of Ann M. Martin\u2019s series \u201cThe Baby-Sitters Club\u201d for its new imprint, Graphix, then acquired Telgemeier\u2019s graphic memoir \u201cSmile,\u201d which she had been publishing as a web comic.\n\n\u201cSmile\u201d became a No. 1 best seller. The book\u2019s success transformed the graphic novel market and children\u2019s publishing, proving there were young readers who were eager for realistic comics. Her books collectively have more than 18 million copies in print.\n\n\u201cRaina single-handedly created the market for middle-grade graphic memoir,\u201d said Saylor, who is now the publisher of Graphix. \u201cThere was a common trope at the time that girls didn\u2019t read comics and that was a boy thing, so the market wasn\u2019t catering to girls and women.\u201d\n\nTelgemeier\u2019s books, which include \u201cSmile,\u201d \u201cSisters\u201d and \u201cGuts,\u201d have more than 18 million copies in print. Scholastic/Graphix\n\nTelgemeier\u2019s books, with their flawed, funny protagonists and nuanced exploration of the knotty emotional landscape of childhood, changed that.\n\nHer intimate, accessible style and stories about young characters facing everyday struggles with school, family drama, friendships and bullies seem to speak directly to kids.\n\n\u201cIf Judy Blume wrote graphic novels, this is what they would look like,\u201d the author Scott Stossel wrote of Telgemeier\u2019s work in the Book Review last month.\n\nTelgemeier followed \u201cSmile\u201d with \u201cDrama,\u201d a graphic novel about kids in a middle school theater club; \u201cSisters,\u201d a memoir about her tortured relationship with her younger sister; and \u201cGhosts,\u201d about a lonely, anxious girl whose family moves to a town populated by spirits.\n\nWith each book, Telgemeier seemed to be challenging herself and her readers to grapple with more difficult and emotionally revealing material.\n\n\u201cAutobiographical comics require a certain level of courage, and her books get progressively more courageous as she deals with more difficult and embarrassing topics,\u201d said the cartoonist and graphic novelist Gene Luen Yang, who has known Telgemeier since the 1990s, when they were both starting out. \u201cShe\u2019s bringing us into her life in a very intimate way.\u201d\n\nRaina Telgemeier at Green Bean Books in Portland, Ore. \u201cComics are great because you don't always have to talk with words,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can use the medium to push ideas without having to fully explain them.\u201d Leah Nash for The New York Times\n\nIn 2016, when she was on tour promoting \u201cGhosts,\u201d Telgemeier began opening up about her long history of anxiety and panic attacks. When she spoke to young readers at book signings, she would mention that she and a central character in \u201cGhosts\u201d both suffered from anxiety. \u201cI would let that hang in the air, and people would come up and ask me, What do you mean?\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a difficult time in her life, and she had started seeing a therapist again for the first time in 25 years. The previous year, she and her husband had filed for divorce. She started to feel as if her phobias were closing in on her. \u201cIt had gotten pretty bad, and I was cutting myself off from a lot of things in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nShe started to write a book about the source of her anxiety \u2014 an experience she had when she was 9 and caught a stomach flu, which gave rise to an unshakable fear of germs and getting sick. She finished her first draft in about a month.\n\nTelgemeier starts each project by sketching out the pages in pencil, with rough panels, images and text. She does the final artwork on Bristol board, with Col-Erase light blue colored pencil, followed by graphite pencil, which she then she inks over with waterproof India ink so that the images are sharp. Finally, she scans the images into a computer, and a colorist fills in the colors digitally.\n\nIn this series from \u201cGuts,\u201d Telgemeier shows us how she goes from sketches to finished panels. \u201cMy writing process is called thumbnailing. I sketch out the whole page in the panels. I put little word balloons and stick figures.\u201d \u201cMy brain really does think in pictures so when I get a note that says this scene needs more explanation, I resketch it. It\u2019s a pretty analog process.\u201d \u201cWith comics you don't need to describe, you just need to show. I\u2019m letting the visuals do a lot of the work.\u201d \u201cI worked with my colorists too, to say this part is late at night, it should be really dark...\u201d \u201c...and then it should look garishly bright when they\u2019re in the bathroom. This isn't stuff that I think about, it\u2019s just instinctive.\u201d\n\nThe story for \u201cGuts\u201d came together quickly, in part because Telgemeier had been thinking about it for so long.\n\n\u201cI had this story on my mind for a really long time because it\u2019s a story I live every day, but I shied away from it because it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s a simpler book, and in some ways it\u2019s the toughest book I\u2019ve ever written.\u201d\n\nShe also decided that her young audience could handle the subject.\n\n\u201cI don't think I could have told this story any time sooner, but I do think that writing \u2018Smile,\u2019 writing \u2018Sisters,\u2019 opening myself up and letting readers have access to these memories, gave me the courage to be able to tell this story, because I knew I could trust them,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew they were ready for it. I knew we could have a conversation about it.\u201d\n\nAt a recent event to promote \u201cGuts\u201d at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan, Telgemeier began by telling the audience about her reluctance to write about her stomach problems and anxiety.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to spend my whole life with this, and I\u2019ve avoided talking about this for a really long time,\u201d she said.\n\nShe asked the crowd, a packed room full of kids and their parents, if there were things that made them feel afraid, and hands shot up across the room.\n\nAfter Telgemeier concluded her talk, her young fans pelted her with questions.\n\n\u201cHave you ever thrown up as an adult?\u201d (No.)\n\n\u201cIs it true that you were in a car with a snake?\u201d (Yes.)\n\n\u201cAre you still afraid of snakes?\u201d (Yes.)\n\n\u201cIs your favorite restaurant still Burger King?\u201d (No.)\n\n\u201cCan we be friends?\u201d\n\nIn response to that, Telgemeier said that she hoped the girl felt like they were already friends.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI do.\u201d", "description": "The graphic novelist behind \u201cGuts\u201d shows how she works and talks about why she opened up about her anxiety.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/books/Raina09Topper/Raina09Topper-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
