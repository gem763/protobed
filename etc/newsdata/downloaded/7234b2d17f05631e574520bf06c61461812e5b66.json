(Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer, Getty Images)\n\nFacebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg denied that the company\u2019s forays into political ads\u2060 have anything to do with financial gain at Vanity Fair\u2019s New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nPolitical ads have quickly become one of the most toxic parts of the Facebook advertising ecosystem, with the company and other major social media firms refusing to take down ads that openly lie about political opponents.\n\nSpeaking with reporter Katie Couric, Sandberg said that \u201cIt\u2019s not for the money, let\u2019s start there. This is a very small part of our revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201c... It\u2019s very small, very small,\u201d Sandberg added. \u201cAnd it is very controversial. We\u2019re not doing this for the money.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said, Facebook allowed the ads because they are part of some ambiguously defined discourse and insisted, against all evidence to the contrary, that it\u2019s really small issues and candidates that benefit from its massive advertising machine.\n\n\u201cWe take political ads because we really believe they are part of political discourse,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you look at this over time, the people who have the most benefited from being able to run ads are people who are not covered by the media so they can\u2019t get their message out.\u201d\n\nSandberg also touted Facebook\u2019s ad disclosure database as \u201creally important because you can\u2019t hide,\u201d as \u201cAnyone can go in the library and see any ad that any politician anywhere is running.\u201d (In other words, others can clean up the mess they made.) She added that while if \u201csomething is hate or bullying, it comes down\u201d from Facebook \u2014 something that\u2019s quite debatable \u2014 if it\u2019s fake, \u201cWe don\u2019t take it off.\u201d\n\nSandberg touched on Facebook\u2019s broader disinformation problem: \u201c... It is the price of free speech. That means there is going to be all the beauty and all the ugliness of humanity... We are going to fight to keep the bad off but keep the good going.\u201d Someone should tell her about the gaping loopholes in Facebook\u2019s systems that allow for dark money groups to run issue-based and political ads with little oversight just by placing proxy ad buyers or affiliate companies\u2019 names in disclosures, something that is arguably more disconcerting than ads run directly by specific campaigns.\n\nFacebook has adamantly argued that it is making significant progress on this, but reports have not been encouraging.\n\nThe COO also trotted out a strange statistic arguing that Facebook does not work as an echo chamber, as is often alleged, per CNET. According to Sanberg, news that users encounter on Facebook \u201cwill be from another point of view\u201d around 26 per cent of the time, which means \u201cIt is unequivocally true that Facebook usage and uses of social media show you broader points of view, not narrower points of view.\u201d", "description": "Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg denied that the company\u2019s forays into political ads\u2060 have anything to do with financial gain at Vanity Fair\u2019s New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles on Tuesday....", "authors": ["Alex Choros", "Matt Novak"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/bmqf9xd9qkj0u6l8xdik.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
