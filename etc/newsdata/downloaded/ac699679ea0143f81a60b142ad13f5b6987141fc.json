Over 2.5 Goals is priced at 4/5.\n\nRashford\u2019s half-century boost\n\nMarcus Rashford has not been at his consistent best this season but had a reason to celebrate on Sunday.\n\nHis goal in the 3-1 win away to Norwich City was his 50th in a Manchester United shirt.\n\nRashford reached the mark in fewer games (183) than it took Cristiano Ronaldo (188) and it could be a confidence boost for the striker, who is 2/1 to score at any time.\n\nBatshuayi to make his mark\n\nThis Carabao Cup tie presents the perfect opportunity for Michy Batshuayi to stake his claim for a regular first-team place.\n\nThe Belgian has made just seven appearances so far but scored four times, including two against Grimsby, and is 23/20 to score at any time against United.\n\nHis most recent goal for Chelsea sealed a 1-0 Champions League win away to Ajax and the same result with Batshuayi to score is 22/1.\n\nUnited\u2019s chance of silverware\n\nManchester United are realistically out of the title race so the cup competitions give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his best chance of a trophy in his first full season as manager.\n\nThe Red Devils will be up for this one and William Hill have them at 16/5 to come out victorious in 90 minutes and 13/10 to qualify.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side are also unbeaten in their last four against Chelsea, including an impressive 4-0 win on the opening day.\n\nUnited are 7/2 to keep their second clean sheet of the season against Chelsea.\n\nAnother hat-trick for Pulisic?\n\nIt would have been impossible not to talk about Christian Pulisic\u2019s hat-trick against Burnley.\n\nThe American scored with his right foot, left foot and head in his best performance yet in a Chelsea shirt.\n\nUnited will pose a different test for Chelsea, but if you fancy Pulisic to score another hat-trick, he is 250/1 with William Hill.\n\nFor those not as confident in Pulisic\u2019s consistency in front of goal, you can get him at 27/10 to score at any time.\n\nThe Martial effect\n\nAnthony Martial is back from injury and reminding United fans what they were missing in his absence.\n\nThe Frenchman has scored against FK Partizan and Norwich since returning and has helped United win 77% of the games in which he has started in the Premier League.\n\nUnited fans will be hoping he can transfer that talismanic touch to the Carabao Cup and William Hill have Martial at 11/2 to score at any time and United to win.", "description": "Betting preview as Premier League heavyweights Chelsea and Manchester United will fight it out for a place in the Carabao Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/betting/Better-Collective/chelsea-flags-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
