Dwyer had failed three drug tests late last year, the United States Anti-Doping Agency said on Oct. 11.\n\nA panel with the American Arbitration Association determined that Dwyer had violated the sport\u2019s anti-doping rules and suspended him from competition from Dec. 21, 2018 through Aug. 20, 2020.\n\nTestosterone pellets are a form of hormone therapy that are implanted under the skin and slowly release testosterone over the course of a few months. Increased testosterone can boost an athlete\u2019s performance by promoting muscle building.\n\nDwyer had testified before the panel that he did not know inserting the pellets would count as an anti-doping rule violation and that he had been suffering from health issues, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, depression and anxiety. He said that he was primarily concerned with \u201chis overall mental health and well-being,\u201d and not focused on swimming.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He was \u201cconvinced his use of it had been approved\u201d by the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, they continued.\n\nDwyer had said he relied on his long-time health and fitness coach, Dr. Ed Reardon, and Dr. Dana Russo, a medical doctor with experience in the insertion of the pellets. Dwyer said Russo had said she relied on advice from the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, according to the USADA. (The panel ruled in turn that, \u201ceven though giving such alleged advice is highly unlikely, the Panel finds by a balance of probability that Dr. Russo convincingly reported her understanding (or misunderstanding) of her conversation with the USOPC Respondent.\u201d)\n\nRusso did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TIME.\n\nDwyer testified that he supports the anti-doping mission, has tried to \u201cdo it the right way\u201d his entire career and that he was crushed when he got the notice about the violation from USADA.\n\nHe announced his retirement on social media, saying that \u201cthis is an unfortunate end to an incredible chapter of my life\u201d but that he \u201caccomplished more than (his) wildest dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always felt that swimming chose me \u2013 it has and will always have a very special place in my heart,\u201d he wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn response to the USADA verdict specifically, Dwyer said that he was \u201cpleased\u201d that the panel \u201cacknowledged that (he) made an honest but unfortunate mistake in regards to (his) medical treatment\u201d and that he \u201cwould never knowingly violate anti-doping rules.\u201d\n\nBy the time of publication, neither USA Swimming nor Team USA had responded to a request to comment from TIME.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Conor Dwyer announced his retirement last week after receiving a 20-month ban for getting testosterone pellets inserted into his body", "authors": ["Sanya Mansoor"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/conor-dwyer-retirement-testosterone-pellets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
