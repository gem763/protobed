The midfielder is a doubt because of an ankle injury sustained in the Carabao Cup win over Rochdale in midweek. Pogba picked up a knock to an ankle on Wednesday. His absence at a team-bonding meal led to further scrutiny on his Old Trafford future but United manger Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said:\n\nThe situation is he finished the game, which is fantastic, but he got a knock to his ankle which is very swollen. It was better for him not to go there with the team and he\u2019s in a race, I would guess, for Monday.\u201d\n\nPogba would be an eighth frontline player unavailable to Solskj\u00e6r.", "description": "News, previews and Friday press conference updates before the seventh week of action in the 2019-20 Premier League", "authors": ["Gregg Bakowski", "Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a8ef0592742fb27249fa1bb81dbe02557c89b5/0_14_4460_2677/master/4460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ee7df2704871a01073a702c1b193f2a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
