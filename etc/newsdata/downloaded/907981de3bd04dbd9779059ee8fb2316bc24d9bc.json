This regime has failed to lead Lebanon and it must be toppled and replaced,\" Mohammad Awada, 32, who is unemployed, said.\n\nThe latest unrest was sparked by anger over the rising cost of living and new tax plans, including a fee on WhatsApp calls, which was quickly retracted after protests - the biggest in decades - broke out.\n\nIn an attempt to appease demonstrators, Lebanon's finance minister announced following a meeting with Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri that they had agreed on a final budget that did not include any additional taxes or fees.\n\nLebanese President Michel Aoun said in a tweet there would be a \"reassuring solution\" to the economic crisis.\n\nThe protests followed a build-up in grievances over perceived government corruption, mismanagement of funds and a failure to address high unemployment.\n\nNasrallah backs government\n\nIn a televised speech addressing the protests on Saturday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group was against the government resigning, and the country did not have enough time for such a move given the acute financial crisis.\n\n\"Everyone should take responsibility rather than being preoccupied with settling political scores while leaving the fate of the country unknown,\" he said.\n\n\"All of us have to shoulder the responsibility of the current situation that we arrived at,\" added Nasrallah, whose Iranian-backed Shia group is Lebanon's most influential.\n\nThe protests that have swept villages and towns across Lebanon recall the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents.\n\nThe Hezbollah leader said he recognised the protests were \"honest and spontaneous\" but warned that his heavily-armed and powerful group, which backed the president's rise to power, would not permit his downfall.\n\nProtesters defiant\n\nIn the country's second city, Tripoli, demonstrator Hoda Sayyur was unimpressed by the contrition some leaders displayed on television and echoed a widely-held hope that the entire political class be replaced.\n\n\"They took all our fundamental rights ... We are dying at hospital gates,\" the woman in her fifties said.\n\n\"I will stay in the street ... Since I was born, we've been spectators to their quarrels and corruption,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday evening, thousands were again packed into the Riyadh al-Solh Square in central Beirut, despite security forces using tear gas and water cannons to disperse similar crowds a day before.\n\nThe Internal Security Forces said 70 arrests were made Friday on accusations of theft and arson.\n\nBut all of those held at the main police barracks were released Saturday, the National News Agency (NNA) said.\n\nLebanon has one of the highest public debt burdens in the world and the government is trying to reach agreement on a package of belt-tightening measures to cap the deficit in next year's budget.\n\nThe promised austerity moves are essential if Lebanon is to unlock $11bn in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.\n\nLebanon's public debt stands at around $86bn - more than 150 percent of gross domestic product, according to the finance ministry.\n\nTimour Azhari contributed reporting from Beirut.", "description": "Tens of thousands demand a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon's political system, citing a wide range of grievances.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/19/7499a06d25a04e038613ad032279872c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
