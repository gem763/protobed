Calabria said the adviser will help the regulator assess capital plans put forward by Fannie and Freddie.\n\nThe pair, which guarantee more than half of the nation\u2019s mortgages, have operated under a government conservatorship since being bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. The Trump administration has renewed efforts to release the pair from government control, issuing a report in September calling for them to be recapitalized and released.\n\nCalabria on Wednesday emphasized that the pair will not be allowed to escape government control without raising a significant amount of capital. To that end, Calabria said he expects to announce in the coming weeks whether the FHFA will re-propose a rule outlining capital requirements for the pair. Analysts expect that regulation must be finalized before the pair could realistically exit.\n\n\u201cIf Fannie and Freddie aren\u2019t able to leave, then they don\u2019t leave. Quite simply they have to be ready to get out,\u201d said Calabria.", "description": "The nation's top housing regulator said on Wednesday that he hopes to hire an outside financial adviser by next month to help the government devise a plan to remove mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie from government conservatorship.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
