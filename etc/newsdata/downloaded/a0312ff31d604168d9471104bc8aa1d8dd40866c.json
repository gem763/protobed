It\u2019s indisputable that children are growing up more immersed in technology and the internet than ever before, which has led to a genre of pieces dedicated to the harms and benefits of growing up in front of screens. \u201cIs Your Child a Digital Addict? Here\u2019s What You Can Do\u201d a headline in The New York Times\u2019s parenting section advises. \u201cThere\u2019s Worrying New Research About Kids\u2019 Screen Time and Their Mental Health,\u201d TIME frets.\n\nYet as any Gen Z teen well knows, many parents today, especially those on the younger end, are often just as online, if not more so, as their kids. According to a 2015 national survey by Common Sense Media, teens spend an average of nine hours a day on media use; yet a 2016 survey of parents found that they also spent an average of nine hours on their screens. We\u2019ve heard a lot about kids who grow up as native internet users, but what is it like to grow up with parents who may be just as invested in their online life as their real ones?\n\n\u201cI think my step-mom\u2019s online persona differs quite a bit,\u201d Hayden, an 18-year-old senior in high school told me. He explained how his mom and step-mom have always been involved in local politics and community groups, but after his family all got smartphones they started participating more online than in person. His parents joined Facebook groups for his high school, got into community discussion forums, and downloaded NextDoor, the neighborhood-level social networking app. \u201cSlowly technological things have replaced real world interactions for them,\u201d Hayden says. \u201cThe online discourse replaced a lot of public forums.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Hayden would watch his step-mom get into argument after argument with strangers online. \u201cIn real life she\u2019s very mild mannered, easy to get along with, easygoing,\u201d Hayden says. \u201cBut on the internet it\u2019s a lot easier for her to be aggressive and unleash anger.\u201d He recalled how she once argued with one of his fellow classmates on Facebook over his school play\u2019s use of a transphobic slur (Hayden is transgender). His step-mom now avoids Hayden\u2019s classmate whenever they go to the local movie theater he works at. In the meantime, Hayden tells me, \u201cI had spoken to him and forgiven him and let go of it because I have to see these kids every day.\u201d\n\nAlycia, a 23-year-old from South Carolina who lives with her parents, told me about how her father will incessantly post selfies on Facebook and Instagram. \u201cHe posts a lot, even his family says that he posts way too much, the selfies, cars, or anything that he\u2019s doing every single day.\u201d She recalled one time when he was helping an old lady who fainted in the hospital, he posted a selfie of himself with her unconscious in the background. \u201cI was like oh my god you have to take this off,\u201d Alycia said.\n\nResearch shows that kids who think their parents who are too online often find that it negatively impacts their relationship. According to a 2019 Common Sense survey, children who think their parents are addicted to their device are 18 points more likely to believe that their parent\u2019s behavior has hurt their relationship. Sarah Coyne, a professor of family life at Brigham Young University who studies \"technoference,\" or everyday interruptions of interpersonal interactions due to technological devices, said that research showed that \u201cadolescents whose parents had technoference towards them reported their parents were less warm and less supportive and felt less connected to their parents as a whole.\u201d\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t been studied much is how kids may and or may not have shaped their own online identity around the way their parents use social media. I asked Hayden whether his step-mom\u2019s investment in the online world has changed his. \u201cI used to get into a lot of fights online during 2016,\u201d Hayden says. \u201cThen I saw my stepmother get all worked up about it and from a third party perspective, I was like wow that\u2019s ridiculous, we\u2019re sitting here with family and she\u2019s talking about some guy from Texas arguing with a CNN comment on a Facebook post.\u201d He says he now makes an effort to use social media more personally, and only interact with his friends and close people in his life.\n\nArianna, a 17-year-old who lives in New Jersey, tells me that her mother, who is 40 years old, loves to post to Facebook and Snapchat. \u201cWhen it comes to restaurants, the phone eats first, Snapchat eats first,\u201d she said, referencing her mom\u2019s habit of making them wait to eat whenever they went out to restaurants so she could post a photo to her stories. Arianna also told me about how her mother constantly posts heavily edited selfies, even, at times, editing pictures of her daughter.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that I don\u2019t want to post selfies ever. Like if you check my Instagram I don\u2019t have a single selfie of me.\u201d She told me that she tries to always think before she posts. \u201cPutting meaning into it, not just showing off.\u201d\n\nAlycia echoed a similar sentiment after seeing her dad constantly post what he\u2019s doing all the time. \u201cI see how he uses the internet, he uses it to post everything, I think that changes me a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI realize you don\u2019t have to post everything at every moment, you can just live in the moment.\u201d\n\nYet no matter how kids feel about posting, naturally they often don\u2019t have a lot of control over what their parents do anyways. A common thread among the young people I spoke to was that having parents who post a lot also meant they posted a lot about you. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re the Kardashians,\u201d Alycia joked. Her father, who is 45 years old, constantly posts pictures of her and her siblings. \u201cThree girls and one boy, we\u2019re Kim, Robb, Kourtney, and Khloe in a way.\u201d\n\nWhile a lot of attention is paid to how much time people spend on social media, the context and content matters as well. When it comes to parenting, Jenny Radesky, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan and a developmental behavioral pediatrician, noted that it\u2019s important to find a balance when using technology. \u201cIf you\u2019re so preoccupied with this online space that feels more rewarding that you aren\u2019t spending enough time working on the authentic parts of your relationship with your child that might need work, that\u2019s where the balance may tip over,\u201d Radesky said. Rather than just limiting screen time, parents should be intentional about how they\u2019re using social media and the internet, and whether it\u2019s in ways that connect or in ways than distract and deflect.\n\nRadesky points out that parenting is one of the most stressful jobs. She\u2019s sympathetic to parents who are very invested in curating their online persona or finding gratification online. She says that, rather than rushing to judgement, the question should be, \u201cHow else could they get either that sense of self or that sense of fulfillment or excitement, that doesn\u2019t displace all this other time they could be working on the source of the parenting stress to begin with?\u201d She suggests opening up conversations between parents and children as to how they use their time online and notes that it would be helpful for teens to be able to talk about what they think their parents are doing wrong or right.\n\nThe reaction from teens about having too online parents is not necessarily always negative\u2014Kanika, an 18-year-old sophomore at Purdue University who grew up in the Bay Area, told me that her mother has used social media heavily for the last decade, mostly to connect with other Indian-Americans in the community. \u201cI think it stemmed a lot from coming to the Bay Area from India when there wasn\u2019t as much cultural diversity so they had to find ways to bond together and keep their culture alive within those pockets.\u201d Kanika lists the apps that her mother is active on: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter. She says that there are times when they are out together and they\u2019ll run into someone who her mother has only met online and stop to talk to them.\n\n\u201cIt just made me a lot more comfortable with using the internet. There\u2019s a lot of people who like to give this false persona of themselves on the internet,\u201d Kanika said. \u201cSeeing my mom still be herself on the internet was a good thing to have because I realized that I can be myself.\u201d", "description": "Young adults weigh on the impact their parents' selfies, internet comments, and posting have had on their self-image and how they use technology.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf3d6ee60fe9000a45094c/lede/1571766396000-What-Its-Like-to-Have-Parents-Who-Are-Extremely-Online_HF.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
