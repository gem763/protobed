I have become a target. At some point people even blamed me for a defeat in which I hadn't played at all.'\n\nMustafi became the most expensive German centre back of all time when he moved to the Emirates Stadium in 2016 for \u20ac40million (\u00a336m).\n\nThe German feels that criticism of his performances has 'become irrational' with fans online\n\nDespite starting with promise he has more recently been vilified over his performances with Arsenal's defensive fragility showing little signs of improvement during his time at the club. Many supporters had hoped he would become the dominating centre back they had desired but he has struggled to establish a regular place since Unai Emery arrived.\n\nSocial media is highlighted as one reason behind the increasingly sharp vitriol aimed towards him but it was criticism from former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit that annoyed him most. Petit, now retired and particularly outspoken on his former club, called Mustafi the 'King of Blunders'.\n\nIn response he said: 'That annoyed me a lot. It's one thing when fans or the media criticise you. But it's something completely different when an ex-player, who knows how hard it is sometimes on the field, says something like that.\n\n'I expect those players to be more sensitive and to see what this sharp criticism can do. In the past, it might have been in the paper for a day and then people would have forgotten. Today it's on the Internet and it's going to haunt me for the rest of my career.'", "description": "Shkodran Mustafi has dismissed a fan poll that rated him as the second worst defender in the world and says criticism of his performances by Arsenal fans has 'become irrational'.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19448990-0-image-a-93_1570548232196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
