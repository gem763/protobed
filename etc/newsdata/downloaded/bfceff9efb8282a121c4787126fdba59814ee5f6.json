It looked like a routine traffic stop that we conduct every day.\u201d\n\nAfter their conversation, Lee said Dhaliwal closed the driver\u2019s door and headed towards his patrol car but within seconds, was \u201cambushed\u201d by the suspect, who came running at him with a gun and fired two shots from behind.\n\nDeputy Sandeep Dhaliwal | Jon Shapley/AP More\n\nRELATED: Off-Duty St. Louis Officer, 24, Shot and Killed by On-Duty Cop Who \u2018Mishandled\u2019 Gun\n\nA woman who was doing yard work nearby heard the commotion and witnessed the alleged suspect flee the scene. She immediately tended to Dhaliwal and called 911, waiting with him until first responders arrived at the scene.\n\nLee said Dhaliwal was rushed to the hospital via life flight but sadly succumbed to his injuries shortly after.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to convey our sadness. Please keep his family and our agency in your prayers,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in the devastating announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of local officers circulated the suspect\u2019s photo based on the dashboard camera footage and were allegedly able to find him inside a nearby business less than a mile away.\n\n\u201cA deputy observed that he looked a little nervous and put him in custody, and that did turn out to be our shooter,\u201d Lee stated, adding that the weapon was recovered in the same parking lot of the nearby business.\n\nOfficers later identified the suspect as Robert Solis, 47, and charged him with capital murder. An unnamed female who was a passenger in the getaway vehicle was also taken into custody, Lee said.\n\nRobert Solis | HCSOTexas More", "description": "Texas Officer Who Wore Turban Shot and Killed While on Duty", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x4p.CsTW0lke8.FQ.mupIQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1b86ca8865c8a3cb345f3317021482e7", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
