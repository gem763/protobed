(Oct. 4) AP, AP\n\nKENNER, La. \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., connected Louisiana's upcoming governor's race to the 2020 presidential election as they rallied support for two GOP candidates challenging Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\"Louisiana said yes to Trump in 2016 and we need Louisiana to send a Republican to the governor's office and for Louisiana to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump,\" Pence told an audience of 250 to 300 supporters Saturday at the Pontchartrain Center.\n\n\"It all starts here,\" said Pence, who never mentioned Edwards by name. \"It all starts now.\"\n\nRep. Ralph Abraham, R-La., and wealthy Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone are the top two Republicans challenging Edwards, who is the only Democratic governor in the Deep South.\n\nRepublicans hope they can keep Edwards from winning outright in the Oct. 12 primary election and send either Abraham or Rispone into a runoff election against the governor, where the dynamics will change.\n\nTrump impeachment inquiry: Vice President Mike Pence gets document request from House Democrats\n\nU.S. Sen.

It's been an absolute honor to fight side by side with (Trump and Pence) making America great again. As your next governor, I look forward to working with Pence and Trump making Louisiana win.\"\n\n\"We need someone like Trump to bring Louisiana with the rest of the country \u2014 a conservative, an outsider, a CEO; that's what we need,\" said Rispone, who likens his campaign to Trump's. \"Louisiana has been run by special interests.

Don\u2019t be fooled, John Bel Edwards will NEVER be for us. Early voting has already started!\"\n\nEdwards' campaign said the governor has a history of working with Republicans including Trump.\n\n\"Gov. Edwards has a long record of working across the aisle at the state and federal level, guiding us through natural disasters and budget crises and giving teachers their first pay raise in 10 years,\" Edwards campaign spokesman Eric Holl said. \"He'll keep putting Louisiana first in his second term.\"\n\nGreg Hilburn covers state politics for the USA TODAY Network of Louisiana.
