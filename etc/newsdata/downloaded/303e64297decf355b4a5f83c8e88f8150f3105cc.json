The imperial presidency is no different. It has long been disdainful of Congress, but now, under the Trump administration, it is reaching a peak of contempt for it . Even so, President Trump\u2019s recent aggrandizement of the executive branch may have the ironic and salutary effect of shrinking the power of the presidency by awakening the countervailing power of a long-dormant Congress.\n\nWhile the impeachment inquiry that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the House of Representatives announced Tuesday is confined for now to the controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, it was also the culmination of several provocations. In recent days alone, Mr. Trump has directed Corey Lewandowski, who did not work for the White House, to refuse to answer certain questions before Congress. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, replying to Manhattan prosecutors\u2019 subpoena of the president\u2019s tax returns, argued not simply that the subpoena was politically motivated but also that sitting presidents cannot be criminally investigated at all.\n\nMost significantly, of course, the administration initially refused to comply with a broadly applicable legal requirement that Congress be informed of significant abuses involving intelligence officials. In this case, the complaint appears to suggest that Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into an investigation of one of his 2020 rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and that White House officials tried to cover his trail.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s inflation of his authority in several realms maintains a longstanding trend of presidential expansion in the face of Congressional acquiescence. The important constitutional point is less the fate of any particular president than the trajectory of the presidency as an office. It has been growing since the Great Depression. The war on terror inflated the presidency further still. President Barack Obama took executive unilateralism into the domestic realm. Eventually this growth reaches the point of imperial overextension.", "description": "And may have awakened a long-dormant Congress.", "authors": ["Greg Weiner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/opinion/26Weiner/26Weiner-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
