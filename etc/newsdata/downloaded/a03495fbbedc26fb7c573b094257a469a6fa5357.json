(Reuters)\n\nIt was a no-brainer situation to go for a touchdown, with nothing to lose beyond the pride of not having a zero on the scoreboard.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nTomlin chose pride. He sent out the field goal unit, where Chris Boswell converted on a 19-yard attempt that did nothing to increase Pittsburgh\u2019s chances of winning.\n\nTomlin slammed\n\nSocial media was not kind to Tomlin\u2019s cowardly decision.\n\nSeems like the Pittsburgh defense stopped trying after Tomlin went with the \u201cwe\u2019re-not-getting-shutout\u201d field-goal. \u2014 Dan Wetzel (@DanWetzel) September 9, 2019\n\nJames Washington inexplicably steps out of bounds and Mike Tomlin opts for a field goal from the 1. I don't know which is more insulting to good football. \u2014 Michael Kist (@MichaelKistNFL) September 9, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nGood thing Tomlin kicked that field goal. Crucial. \u2014 Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) September 9, 2019\n\nReporter: Mike, why did you decide to kick that field goal from the one?\n\n\n\nTomlin: It is what it is. The standard is the standard. \u2014 JJ Zachariason (@LateRoundQB) September 9, 2019\n\nI want to hear Mike Tomlin's explanation for kicking that field goal. Like, what is the rationale behind it? Did he think his defense was going to stop the Patriots from scoring again? Lol. I would love to know the thought process behind kicking from the 1 down 20-0 at the Pats \u2014 Nick Kostos (@TheKostos) September 9, 2019\n\nWhat a useless field goal by the Steelers. You're still down three scores. You're on the 1-yard line. 20-3 \u2014 Greg A. Bedard (@GregABedard) September 9, 2019\n\nTom Brady and Bill Belichick have made careers out of demoralizing opponents. Rarely have they done so so thoroughly this early in the season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Mike Tomlin inexplicably chose to kick a field goal from the 1-yard line while trailing 20-0.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8euZLY40pHqs3n9egPGGUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M5SvRBQVBwzsSr8bDR39sw--~B/aD0zNTEwO3c9NTI1ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ad62abc0-d2b1-11e9-9ac6-957e702950c4", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
