What's that?", "language": "en", "text": "(Updates with Fed's actions on Wednesday)\n\nBy Richard Leong\n\nSept 18 (Reuters) - As if the U.S. Federal Reserve did not already have enough on its plate heading into its meeting on interest rates this week, chaos deep inside the plumbing of the U.S. financial system has thrown policymakers an unexpected curveball.\n\nCash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up earlier this week, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10% for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed's rate.\n\nThat forced the Fed to make an emergency injection of more than $125 billion over the past two days, its first major market intervention since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, to prevent borrowing costs from spiraling even higher. While the effort restored a measure of order to the short-term bank funding market, it was not enough to stop the Fed's benchmark lending rate from rising on Tuesday above its targeted range of 2.00% to 2.25%.\n\nThe exact cause of the squeeze is a matter of some debate, but most market participants agree that two coincidental events on Monday were at least partly to blame. First, corporations had to withdraw funds from money market accounts to pay for quarterly tax bills, and on the same day the banks and investors who bought the $78 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds sold by Uncle Sam last week had to settle up.\n\nOn top of that, the reserves that banks park with the Fed and are often made available to other banks on an overnight basis are at their lowest since 2011 thanks to the central bank's culling of its vast portfolio of bonds over the past few years.\n\nAdded together, these factors are testing the limits of the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement - or repo - market, a gray but essential component of the U.S. financial system.\n\nWhatever the cause, the episode has added fuel to the argument that the Fed needs to take steps to avoid more disruptions in the repo market down the road.\n\nWHY IS THE REPO MARKET IMPORTANT?\n\nThe repo market underpins much of the U.S. financial system, helping to ensure banks have the liquidity to meet their daily operational needs and maintain sufficient reserves.\n\nIn a repo trade, Wall Street firms and banks offer U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality securities as collateral to raise cash, often overnight, to finance their trading and lending activities. The next day, borrowers repay their loans plus what is typically a nominal rate of interest and get their bonds back. In other words, they repurchase, or repo, the bonds.\n\nThe system typically hums along with the interest rate charged on repo deals hovering close to the Fed's benchmark overnight rate, which it cut on Wednesday to 1.75% to 2.00%, from 2.00% to 2.25%.\n\nBut when investors get fearful of lending, as seen during the global credit crisis, or when there are just not enough reserves or cash in the system to lend out, it sends the repo rate soaring above the Fed Funds rate.\n\nTrading in stocks and bonds can become difficult. It can also pinch lending to businesses and consumers and, if the disruption is prolonged, it can become a drag on a U.S. economy that relies heavily on the flow of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT HAS CAUSED THE DROP IN BANK RESERVES?\n\nComing out of the financial crisis, after the Fed cut interest rates to near zero and bought more than $3.5 trillion of bonds, banks built up massive reserves held at the Fed.\n\nBut that level of bank reserves, which peaked at nearly $2.8 trillion, began falling when the Fed started raising interest rates in late 2015. They fell even faster when the Fed started to cut the size of its bond portfolio about two years later.\n\nThe Fed stopped raising interest rates last year and cut them in July and again on Wednesday. It has also now ceased allowing bonds to roll off its balance sheet.\n\nThe question vexing policymakers now is whether those actions are enough to stop the downward drift in reserves, which are a main source of liquidity in funding markets like repo.\n\nBank reserves at the Fed last stood at $1.47 trillion, the lowest level since 2011 and nearly 50% below their peak from five years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT CAN THE FED DO TO CALM THE REPO MARKET?\n\n1. RUN SPOT REPO OPERATIONS\n\nThrough the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed can conduct occasional spot repo operations at times of funding stress, allowing banks and dealers to swap their Treasuries and other high-quality securities for cash at a minimal interest rate. It did this on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As if the U.S. Federal Reserve did not already have enough on its plate heading into its meeting on interest rates this week, chaos deep inside the plumbing of the U.S. financial system has thrown policymakers an unexpected curveball.
