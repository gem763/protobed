In the latest effort by Mr Trump to try and deter asylum seekers, since January residents of Spanish-speaking countries \u2013 having made their applications to the US authorities \u2013 are forced to wait for them to be processed, not in the United States, but in Mexican cities, many of which are as dangerous as the places they have left.\n\nWhile the conditions faced by would-be migrants in US custody, especially by children, have triggered widespread political debate, those endured by applicants outside of the country under the new scheme have received very little attention.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Families belong together\u2019 protests over Trump immigration policy Show all 8 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Nuevo Laredo in the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas, and San Luis Rio Colorado, which borders Arizona, have been added to the list. Reuters said Tamaulipas was home to the Gulf and Zeta cartels, which are involved in people trafficking as well as drug smuggling.\n\nAnother border city used as a petri dish for the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cStay in Mexico\u201d policy is Ciudad Juarez, the sister city of El Paso, Texas, which found itself in the headlines earlier this month after a mass shooting at a Walmart killed 22 people and injured many others. The city, founded when Mexico\u2019s territory spread much further northwards, has a population of 1.5 million, with 700,000 in El Paso. The two cities, separated by the Rio Grande, combine to create the largest bilingual, binational conurbation in the hemisphere.\n\nThousands of people legally pass back and forth each day, using one of four international crossings, for school, for work, to visit relatives and to go shopping. It is alleged the suspect in the Walmart terror attack intentionally targeted El Paso because of its large Hispanic population. Eight Mexican citizens were among the dead.\n\n\u201cXenophobic and racist discourse breeds hate crimes,\u201d Mexico\u2019s US ambassador Martha B\u00e1rcena, said after the shootings, amid allegations Mr Trump was fuelling violent bigotry with his often racist remarks about immigrants. \u201cHispanic communities contribute enormously to the American society. We have to work for a respectful and compassionate dialogue between our countries and communities.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The most extraordinary thing about the short walk across the Paso del Norte International Bridge was not any sudden culture shock \u2013 indeed, there was little of that \u2013 but how quick and seamless the journey was, if you had the \u201ccorrect\u201d passport or visa.\n\n\u201cThe number of people waiting in Juarez is major \u2013 it\u2019s eclipsed the numbers in Tijuana,\u201d says Nicolas Palazzo, a staff lawyer with Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Centre. \u201cOne of the problems is that there are only four immigration judges in El Paso to hear all these cases.\u201d\n\nPalazzo explains that MPP policy only applies to Spanish-speaking migrants. The largest number came from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Cuba. He says a lot of Cuban doctors are in Ciudad Juarez, waiting for the call to assemble at the crossing at 4.30am and cross to El Paso for their hearings. \u201cThere has been an increase in Venezuelans,\u201d he says, referring to reports that as many as 4 million have fled since 2015. \u201cBut as the crisis has become worse, a lot of countries [such as Brazil, Columbia and Peru] have tightened the situation for Venezuelans.\u201d\n\nThe Independent agreed to identify the people the lawyers were speaking to only by an initial and their country, in order to protect them or their family against possible reprisals back home. But close to the borrowed offices in a Mexican municipal building where the lawyers and volunteers worked, there were many migrants expressing anger and frustration, who were happy to provide their full name.\n\nOrlando Alvarez, 54, left Cuba in 1994 and had lived in the US and Paraguay. His green card had expired and he had been waiting four months for his hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy here. Juarez is a very crazy city \u2013 there is a lot of crime here,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother Cuban, Rolando Delgodal, left the country recently and has spent three months in Juarez. He said the situation in Cuba had become worse since the death of Fidel Castro and the passing of power to the next generation of Communist Party of Cuba leadership. \u201cWe have no free speech there,\u201d says Delgodal, who worked for the government\u2019s department of culture.\n\nJohn Breslin, an immigration lawyer who lives south of Chicago, was among the volunteers screening potential cases for Las Americas, before a decision was made on whether or not they have a viable claim for asylum.\n\n\u201cI am trying to find out if the facts of their case \u2013 the reasons why they left their home country \u2013 fit into a valid asylum claim.\u201d\n\nHe was working with Octavia Marsh, a former professor of English literature, who grew up in Las Cruces, New Mexico, 40 miles northwest of El Paso.\n\n\u201cPeople have every kind of story you can imagine. Some have crossed through nine or 10 countries just to get here,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the US can regularise this process so that these people have a chance to save their lives \u2013 literally to save their lives.\u201d\n\nOne of their cases was a Cuban, J, who had gone to Venezuela as part of a mission established between the two countries, and married a Venezuelan woman. After being forced to attend political events in support of the Venezuelan government, he quit the mission. Recently he had been threatened by the authorities after refusing to pay a bribe. Having made his way to Juarez, he says he had been robbed at an ATM and had crossed the Rio Grande in order to get detained, in what he hoped would speed his application.\n\nIn a windowless office, harshly lit by fluorescent light, he is asked if he could return to Cuba if not Venezuela. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI would be persecuted for my political opinions and for having deserted.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to questions as to how many people were being dealt with by the MPP process, and claims that migrants were being intentionally forced to wait in dangerous conditions as an intentional deterrent. When the policy was introduced in January, the then DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed: \u201cMPP will help restore a safe and orderly immigration process, decrease the number of those taking advantage of the immigration system, and the ability of smugglers and traffickers to prey on vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\nAnother case, S, a young woman from El Salvador, is with her daughters, aged two and eight. She says she left her country in May after being threatened by her husband, who she said was a member of the MS-13 gang, and had been jailed for murdering a young woman.\n\nHer daughters are briefly taken outside the room by another volunteer, as S weeps, saying she had been told by her husband if she tried to start a new life without him, he would have her killed and the girls taken away. Did her mother and father want her to leave, she is asked?\n\n\u201cMy parents did not want me to go, but I told them I was going,\u201d she says, adding that the police in El Salvador had relationships with gang members. \u201cI am afraid to return to El Salvador.\u201d\n\nAsked what she intended to do if her application for asylum was unsuccessful, she answers promptly. \u201cI have not thought about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI am hoping God is going to make it happen. I know he will make it happen.\u201d", "description": "Their anguish pools like floodwater.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/14/19/juarez-migrants1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-15"}
