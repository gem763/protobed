The head of the Jewish community in Halle, Max Privorotzki, said he was able to watch the attacker via a CCTV screen.\n\nFederal prosecutors said on Friday that the suspect had confessed to the attack and to being motivated by antisemitism and right-wing extremism, during an interrogation lasting several hours.\n\nJewish communities across Europe have increasingly taken precautions to safeguard themselves against violence after a sharp rise in antisemitism.\n\n'I worried it would be a matter of time': Halle grieves after shootings Read more\n\nIn 2015, the Halle synagogue received a grant from the security assistance fund, a project run by the Jewish Agency for Israel, the world\u2019s largest Jewish non-profit organisation. The fund was set up after the deadly shootings at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, in 2012.\n\nThe Jewish Agency chairman, Isaac Herzog, said the project had paid out about $11m (\u00a39m) to Jewish communities for security equipment in more than 58 countries.\n\n\u201cWe upgraded and donated the entire security equipment for the community in Halle,\u201d he said, adding that the New York-based Helmsley Charitable Trust provided the money. \u201cThat donation saved lives.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The head of the Jewish community in Halle, Max Privorotzki, speaks outside the synagogue.

Documents released online by Balliet showed he had noticed the synagogue had implemented security measures, including surveillance cameras and a door \u201cthat can only be opened by someone inside with an electric door panel\u201d.\n\nAfter the gunman began shooting, a volunteer security guard secured the entrance while worshippers barricaded themselves inside. By the end of the attack, the gunman, whose assault was hindered when his homemade weapons repeatedly jammed, had shot dead a woman outside the synagogue and a man in a nearby kebab shop.\n\nGerman police have been criticised for a slow response, and the interior minister later announced it would permanently improve security measures at synagogues across the country.\n\nHerzog said there was concern at why there was no police already at the synagogue. \u201cIt was clear that there was a standing order throughout Germany, during the [Jewish] high holidays, to make sure they were all very well protected,\u201d he said.\n\nHerzog wrote a pointed letter on Thursday to Angela Merkel, saying the Halle attack \u201cshould sound the alarm loud and clear throughout Europe\u201d.\n\nHe called on the German chancellor to ensure security around synagogues and Jewish institutions was given high priority, especially during the week-long Jewish holiday of Sukkot , which starts on Sunday evening, when Jews will congregate in synagogues and community centres.\n\nHe added: \u201cI also ask, with due respect, that you deploy all necessary efforts to actively and effectively combat antisemitism through legislation, enforcement and education.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hardened door and security cameras helped protect dozens of people from gunman", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be56106f6dd937c062fcf0d787f174dd525dbb6a/0_204_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc34252c0b3dd2bf472c4ea2ee94418c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
