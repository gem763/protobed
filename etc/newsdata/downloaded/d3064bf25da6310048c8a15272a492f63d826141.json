There\u2019s been speculation that it will cost around $50,000, come in short and long-range variants, and be available in rear or all-wheel drive configurations.\n\nThe new EV is expected to be the flagship of Ford\u2019s big $11 billion push into electric vehicles, which is supposed to spawn 40 all-electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022 (across all of Ford\u2019s global markets). Ford has also teased an all-electric F-150 truck that is expected to follow the SUV into the market.\n\nFord has diversified its electrification plans since announcing the $11 billion effort in 2018, too. The company announced this past April that it will build an electric SUV using tech from EV startup Rivian as part of a $500 million investment. Ford is also partnering with Volkswagen, and it will build at least one electric vehicle using Volkswagen\u2019s modular EV platform.", "description": "Ford will unveil its first mass-market electric vehicle \u2014 a Mustang-inspired SUV codenamed \"Mach 1\" that was first teased in January 2018 \u2014 on November 17th at the Los Angeles Auto Show.
