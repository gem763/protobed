My body felt entangled with a multitude of emotion.\n\nI was excited, I felt immediate love for the new life growing inside of me, and I was happy for we had another chance of bringing home a sibling for our eldest daughter.\n\nOn the flip side, dread, worry, concern and a longing for the future we could only hope this pregnancy would present us with filled my mind.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live/ WS)\n\nI prayed for a healthy living baby, as that\u2019s all we wanted. Boy, girl, it honestly didn\u2019t matter, so long as they were ok.\n\nHaving previously suffered four miscarriages and the full term stillbirth of our second daughter Ava, it was difficult to believe our dreams would become a reality.\n\nThe next eight months were some of the hardest I have ever lived through.\n\nI was going to have to find a strength I never knew I had.\n\nI\u2019d seek help from sources which I\u2019d never known existed and I\u2019d worry each day about a million and one different things.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live/ WS)\n\nAt my first midwife appointment, my midwife walked out of the room and wrapped her arms around me. We\u2019d been in the same position just a few months earlier when she\u2019d booked me in for my sixth pregnancy.\n\nAnother tiny baby I tragically went on to miscarry at ten weeks gestation. We\u2019d miscarried three times before this in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.\n\nOur first miscarriage happened on my birthday in 2015 while we were in Disneyland Paris...\n\nDuring my first midwife appointment my midwife kindly suggested the services provided by the Perinatal Mental Health Team. Putting on a brave face I told her I\u2019d be ok.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t be and if I\u2019d been honest with myself, I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be. I just didn\u2019t want to admit it.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live/ WS)\n\nThe first twelve weeks of my son\u2019s pregnancy were filled with concern regarding miscarriage. Prior to finding out I had fallen pregnant with him, I\u2019d just started to have investigations as to why I\u2019d miscarried on four occasions.\n\nI was due to have another hospital appointment, which I had to cancel when seeing those two pink lines.\n\nEvery time I went to the toilet I was worried I\u2019d be confronted with the signs of another miscarriage occurring.\n\nAnd on New Year\u2019s Eve while bucket shaking for Ava\u2019s Fund (set up in memory of Ava to help raise awareness of and reduce stillbirth rates across the South West) it happened.\n\nThere in front of me was the sign I\u2019d been dreading and I had to leave the charitable event early.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live/ WS)\n\nI called my midwife and she booked me an appointment for an additional early scan on the 2nd January 2019. Thankfully, the bleeding had been caused by a subchorionic hemorrhage and our baby was ok.\n\nI went on to have many scans throughout the pregnancy, constantly checking to make sure our baby was okay.\n\nBefore reaching the halfway point, I found myself in hospital with suspected appendicitis. When this happened my only concern was for that of our baby, wanting to know whether they\u2019d be able to operate if necessary and if our baby would be okay.\n\nThankfully the suspected appendicitis was a false alarm and everything was okay.\n\nAt around 18 weeks pregnant when I was sat in the doctor\u2019s surgery being prescribed antibiotics for an infection I asked whether they\u2019d be able to listen in to my baby\u2019s heartbeat.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live/ WS)\n\nI laid on the table for what felt like an eternity while they attempted to locate the beating sound which I longed to hear.\n\nAfter what felt like forever I saw the look on the doctor\u2019s face as she said to the other doctor we need to call the hospital and arrange for this lady to have a scan.\n\nI burst into tears knowing that the last time I\u2019d heard those words the scan confirmed our daughter\u2019s heartbeat had stopped beating.\n\nWe\u2019d heard what no parent wants to hear, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, there\u2019s no heartbeat\u201d.\n\nThankfully in the very same moment, our little boy\u2019s heartbeat was found but this didn\u2019t help my anxiety as I was still terrified that the heartbeat they had located could\u2019ve been mine and that something was wrong.\n\nI asked whether I could have a scan so that I could see our baby alive on the screen but as the heartbeat had been located this wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nI called the hospital directly to ask the same thing and again I was told that because I hadn\u2019t had any bleeding and because his heartbeat had been heard there was no need for a scan.\n\nI remember leaving the doctor\u2019s with tears running down my face\n\nI messaged my friend and she suggested some grounding techniques to help me calm down.\n\nDue to my anxiety being really bad my husband and I paid to have a private scan the following day. The scan took place at Babybond in Plymouth and the sonographer was amazing.\n\nHe went above and beyond to show us everything in detail and let us know our baby boy was okay.\n\n(Image: Plymouth Live/ WS)\n\nAs the pregnancy progressed and I could feel his movements I panicked every time he wasn\u2019t moving. I would sit and wonder when his next movements would be just so I would know he was still okay.\n\nAlthough babies develop their own pattern and spend time asleep, my thinking process was really hard to deal with because of my history.\n\nI had open access to triage during my pregnancy and attended on several occasions with reduced fetal movement. When I got to 37 weeks pregnant I really wanted to bring my induction forward by a week but on speaking to my consultant I realised it would be best to wait as long as I possibly could.\n\nI spent the final week of my pregnancy in the hospital so that I could have monitoring as and when I needed it. During that week my son had a couple of episodes on the monitor where there was a deceleration in his heartbeat.\n\nThis is seen as an abnormality when a lady is not in labour.\n\nThere were also a couple of occasions when a heart trace couldn\u2019t be taken as he was moving so much that it was difficult for the machine to track.\n\nIt was because of this along with my anxiety that I chose to bring the induction forward by a couple of days.\n\nThe induction process started on Friday 19th July 2019.\n\nLowen made his safe arrival into the world two days later on what would\u2019ve been Ava\u2019s third birthday.\n\nMy husband and I will be forever grateful for all of the support we received during Lowen\u2019s pregnancy. I don\u2019t know how we would\u2019ve got through it without this.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been writing this, Lowen, my precious rainbow baby is fast asleep on my lap and I wouldn\u2019t want him to be anywhere else.\"\n\nFundraising to help others\n\nThe couple have raised thousands for stillbirth and have funded hundreds of MAMA Academy wallets at Derriford Hospital to help new mums.\n\nThe MAMA Academy wallets not only protect pregnant women\u2019s maternity notes wherever they go, but they also display important information and advice regarding mum\u2019s health, and that of her baby\u2019s.\n\nTheir five-year-old daughter, Hollie, has also played a big part in helping raise money after the death of her younger sister, including a sponsored 10-mile walk on Dartmoor at three years old.\n\nShe has also stood and shook charity buckets for six hours at a supermarket on New Year\u2019s Eve, has handed out wristbands and stickers and taken part in several charity events.\n\nMum Sophia said: \u201cShe\u2019s helped us through the hardest time of our lives and she now wants to help eliminate our heartache from happening to others.\u201d\n\nDonations can be made to Ava's Fund on the crowdfunding page here .", "description": "A mum who has miscarried four times has told of her journey of pain that finally ended with the arrival of her rainbow baby", "authors": ["Katie Timms", "Image", "Plymouth Live", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575655.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-pain-and-joy-of-a-mum-who-never-gave-upFor-Baby-Loss-Awareness-week-Sophia-has-shared-her-acco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
