Could this be the sign of a Bitcoin crash?\n\nEven though many cryptocurrency analysts, myself included, were discussing the possibility of altcoins taking over some of Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance, what happened was quite the opposite.\n\nAfter a brief moment, where altcoins did see some impressive gains, the market came crumbling down. BTC crashed over 20% and some altcoins even further. Not so much of an altcoin season, was it?\n\nNow, investors and traders worry Bitcoin will remain below $10,000 for the much of the remaining year year.\n\nWill Bitcoin recover?\n\n#bitcoin price and stock-to-flow are cointegrated. Only prediction I take from S2F model is that btc price will be >$100k before Dec 2021 (I did not calculate the exact time, but if btc is <$100k around that time, it becomes non-stationary).

The conundrum, of course, is when.\n\nIf we believe the analysis of PlanB, the analyst who applied a stock-to-flow model to Bitcoin, or other crypto-enthusiasts like Trace Mayer, who created the Mayer multiple which measures if it is a good time to buy or sell Bitcoin, we shouldn\u2019t worry too much about short-term price-action.\n\nInstead of following doomsday scenarios or overly optimistic ones, it\u2019s much simpler to see these crashes as opportunities to increase holdings.\n\nWhy not take these opportunities to scoop more Bitcoin at a discount (aka, buying the dip), instead of worrying when it will recover?\n\nOf course, taking full advantage of a Bitcoin market crash requires solid planning, strategy and a set of conditions to be met.\n\nWhat to do during a Bitcoin crash?\n\nPrices the media declared bitcoin dead: Wired at $2\n\nForbes at $15\n\nBloomberg at $93\n\nNY Mag at $105\n\nSlate $131\n\nBiz Insider at $182\n\nWaPo at $182\n\nUSA Today at $208\n\nNY Times at $208\n\nFT at $290\n\nGuardian at $318\n\nReuters at $327\n\nAOL at $332\n\nCNN at $333\n\nYahoo at $479 Perspective is key. \u2014 Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) September 24, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying the dip refers to purchasing an asset after it has declined in price. It has different contexts depending on the situation in which it is utilised. According to Investopedia, some traders may say they are buying the dip even if an asset is in a long-term strong uptrend, in the hope the uptrend continues after the minor dip or drop. Others may use the phrase when no uptrend is present, but they believe an uptrend may occur in the future.\n\nBuying the dip may work if investors are disciplined enough to not fall into the temptation of buying at the wrong time \u2014 for instance during long bearish periods.\n\nIn order for the below strategy to be effective there is, however, an important requirement.\n\nOne must have cash available to make new entries when the price dips below certain thresholds. To buy the dip, investors and traders must first have enough cash at hand to make an effective purchase.\n\nHowever, you should always consider that price can deepen even further.\n\nDollar cost averaging (DCA)\n\nThe idea behind dollar cost averaging is simply to buy Bitcoin on a recurrent basis. Usually, advocates of the above strategy prefer to set certain days to make purchases and stick to their schedule \u2013 almost like a direct debit. Purchases are made at roughly the same hour so that the asset is always bought independently of the short-term price.\n\nThis \u201cdollar cost averaging\u201d strategy is regarded as one of the safest, as it helps investors and traders to get less emotionally connected to their investments. It\u2019s way easier to buy a bit of something every week than a lot of something in a single transaction.\n\nIf you apply an aggressive DCA strategy to the periods Bitcoin crashes, by having cash available at hand, it\u2019s possible to make steady hourly or daily purchases not worrying about Bitcoin short-term fluctuations.\n\nTo keep on top of the Bitcoin market and receive the latest news about what\u2019s going on with the price, follow Coin Rivet.\n\nThe post How to manage another Bitcoin crash appeared first on Coin Rivet.", "description": "At the time of writing, Bitcoin is sitting well below $10,000, around $7,800.
