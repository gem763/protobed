And by 10am on Friday morning, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) was between 60 to 64 \u2013 in the lower end of the \u201cmoderate\u201d range \u2013 across the island.\n\nWhile it is not yet fully in the clear (a \u201cgood\u201d categorisation requires a reading of 50 and below), this is a drastic improvement from Wednesday, when its 122 reading meant it was one of the world\u2019s top 10 most air-polluted countries.\n\nThe 1-hour PM2.5 reading had also fallen to the mid-section of the \u201cnormal\u201d band, and ranged between 15 to 22.\n\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) said in an advisory on Thursday evening that for the next few days, dry weather in Singapore is expected to persist.\n\nPrevailing winds are forecast to blow from the southeast or south, but are expected to gradually weaken. However, Singapore may still experience increased haziness if the winds shift to blow smoke haze from the surrounding region to Singapore.\n\nFor the next 24 hours, 1-hr PM2.5 concentration readings are expected to remain in the \u201cnormal\u201d band, and may enter the \u201celevated\u201d band. The 24-hr PSI is forecast to be between the high end of the \u201cmoderate\u201d range and low end of the \u201cunhealthy\u201d range, NEA said.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s Sarawak sees air quality worsen to \u2018hazardous\u2019 level again\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia has started cloud seeding in Sarawak, as air quality deteriorated drastically on Friday (Sept 20) morning to reach a \u201chazardous\u201d level.\n\nWhile it hovered in the early 200s for most of Thursday, air quality in Sri Aman steadily worsened through the night and by 6am, cross the 300 mark, which signifies \u201chazardous\u201d air.\n\nBy 10am, the API reading had soared to 420.\n\nThree other API stations in Sarawak also registered \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d readings: 219 in Samarahan, 228 in Sarikei and 246 in Kuching.\n\nAccording to The Star, many places in Kuching and Sri Aman saw visibility reduced to only 200 metres on Friday morning.\n\nVarious agencies in the State Disaster Relief Management Committee have arranged for a cloud seeding plane to fly from Kuching Airport as part of efforts to lessen the smog, The Star reported.\n\nA Bernama report said that the seeding will be done over two days.\n\nMalaysiakini, a news website, also reported that Sri Aman is dealing with a water supply disruption at the same time. It cited Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Minister Douglas Uggah Embas as saying that the water shortage could last until the end of the month.\n\nOther parts of Malaysia dealing with \u201cunhealthy\u201d air\n\nAs of 10am, there were still no regions in Malaysia with \u201cgood\u201d air quality. A total of 42 regions had \u201cmoderate\u201d air quality, while 22 were classified \u201cunhealthy\u201d.\n\nAmong these 22 were Minden in Pulau Pinang (101), Klang (121), Cheras (151), Batu Muda (162).\n\nAir was a lot better in the south, where Johor Bahru recorded a reading of 64.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - This is drastic improvement from Wednesday, when Singapore was one of the world's top 10 most air-polluted countries..
