How will this U.S. move against Chinese companies impact the fragile trade talks? The outlook for a slowdown amid the trade war paints a bleak picture for future demand pushing prices down earlier in the year.\n\nHowever, the 12% drop from Monday\u2019s $63.38 high to yesterday\u2019s $55.55 low may have primed traders to increase demand. While contradictory fundamental messages may be obscuring a clear view, it's perhaps possible to better discern the supply/demand balance from the charts.\n\nWTI Daily Chart\n\nOil contracts rebounded from yesterday\u2019s lows, after nearing the uptrend line of the month. However, the price also closed off the session highs. The price pattern formed a high wave candle denoting more than just a lack of leadership, but actual fear. This candle appears after sharp moves and demonstrates its weakening.\n\nNote that the price is stuck between the 50, 100 and 200 DMAs, which are intertwined like a taut coil, waiting to spring free, as in the breakout. Also, today\u2019s price action bounced off its lows, showing that yesterday\u2019s bears are backing off for the second day.\n\nThe RSI demonstrates that momentum is on the cusp between a continued uptrend and its end.\n\nFrom a risk-reward ratio, a long position is preferred. However, of course, if the price falls, the direction would be more likely to change.\n\nIn the bottom line, after a 12% drop, some dip buyers are sure to come in, creating a dead cat bounce, which occurs when a security rises after an exaggerated fall.\n\nTrade Strategies\n\nConservative traders would wait for a new high past the Sept. 16, $63.38, peak to prove the uptrend\u2019s survival. Then they'd wait for a return move that would find support by the uptrend line.\n\nModerate traders may enter a long position after the uptrend line provides support now, with at least one long green candle. Then, they might wait for a return move.\n\nAggressive traders may risk a position now.\n\nTrade Sample\n\nEntry: $56.00\n\nStop-Loss: $55.00\n\nRisk: $1.00\n\nTarget: $59.00\n\nReward: $3\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: Crude Oil WTI Futures.
