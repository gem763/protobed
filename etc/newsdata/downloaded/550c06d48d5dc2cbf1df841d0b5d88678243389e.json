But at fault for not being deep enough off Slade\u2019s pass that would have bagged him his own try. Getty Images 4/33 Anthony Watson - 7 Quiet game until he exploded into life late on with a mazy run from his own 22 to the Tongan 22, leaving defender after defender in his wake. AFP/Getty Images 5/33 Manu Tuilagi - 9 The star performer by a country mile. First try was born out of his brute strength as he burst through a tackle attempt from Kalamafoni and carried two over the line with him. Second try was more of a case of right place, right time, and he was a constant problem for Tonga to deal with all afternoon. AFP/Getty Images 6/33 Owen Farrell - 6 Pretty quiet throughout and missed his first conversion effort, but had one good run in the lead up to Tuilagi\u2019s opener. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/33 Jonny May - 7 Nice break and awareness to set up Tuilagi for his second try. Made a strong tackle on Tuitavake in the second half, but left the field with what looked like an injury soon after. EPA 8/33 George Ford - 6 Failed to get much going as a blunt England attack took too long to get firing. More was expected from the Ford-Farrell combination.

World Rugby via Getty Images 11/33 Jamie George - 8 Excellent in the lineout as he hit all of his throws in an area where England are dominating the game. Looked to shake off an ankle niggle and was replaced soon after by Luke Cowan-Dickie, who was on hand to score the final try.

PA 14/33 Maro Itoje - 8 Excellent in the air as George repeatedly went to him, and managed to pinch one of Tonga\u2019s throws along with sealing a turnover from a lineout maul. Carried well and got through plenty of defensive work. World Rugby via Getty Images 15/33 Tom Curry - 7 Lead the charge with 15 tackles but will need to up his work-rate with the ball in hand. Getty Images 16/33 Sam Underhill - 8 England\u2019s most prominent forward, winning a penalty at the breakdown and also managing to seal a turnover when first into the ruck. Unlucky not to score a try as his effort was held up by the slimmest of margins.

George Ford continues at fly-half and inherits the captaincy from Owen Farrell, who on his 28th birthday is named on the bench. Willi Heinz comes in at scrum-half to replace Ben Youngs.\n\nThe five other changes all come in the pack, with Cowan-Dickie and Dan Cole joining Joe Marler, who is retained at loosehead prop ahead of Ellis Genge. Joe Launchbury and George Kruis form a new second-row partnership, with Tom Curry and Vunipola continuing in the back row where Lewis Ludlam replaces Sam Underhill.\n\nWith Cole starting and Youngs on the bench, the pair could be in line to make their 91st England appearances to draw level with Jonny Wilkinson in third on the all-time caps list for the nation.\n\nYoungs is joined on the bench by Jack Singleton, with the Saracens hooker potentially getting his first run out for his country in his natural position after only seeing two minutes of action in the warm-up games as a makeshift back-row cover. Genge is named alongside Sinckler as prop cover, with Courtney Lawes included among the replacements after being withdrawn early in the victory over Tonga, while Mark Wilson is in line for his first World Cup appearance from the bench.\n\nYoungs and Farrell cover the half-backs and centres, allowing Anthony Watson to be named as an option in the back three.\n\n\u201cThe four-day turnaround is something we experimented with against Japan last autumn and so the players have had some experience of it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou have to make sure the two days before the game are exactly the same as you would normally have for any other game.\n\n\u201cSo for us, it\u2019s a short and fast run on Wednesday and today is an active recovery day. What I see now is players handling it really well but the game on Thursday will be the litmus test.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at some players that would benefit not playing in this game so have kept them out of the 23. But it is a great opportunity for another set of players to do the team proud.\"\n\nAddressing the US team training on the island of Okinawa, a US military base in the middle of the pacific, Jones added: \u201cUSA are a tough, physical team who are extremely well coached by Gary Gold. There are a number of players who our guys know really well and are a team we respect. They have prepared two weeks with the marines for this game so they will be fit, tough and be playing for the pride of their country.\u201d\n\nAlong with Tuilagi, the other names left out in the squad are Jamie George, Maro Itoje, Underhill, Slade, May and injured duo Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell.\n\nEngland team to face USA\n\nElliot Daly; Ruaridh McConnochie, Jonathan Joseph, Piers Francis, Joe Cokanasiga; George Ford, Willi Heinz; Joe Marler, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Dan Cole; Joe Launchbury, George Kruis; Tom Curry, Lewis Ludlam, Billy Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: Jack Singleton, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Courtney Lawes, Mark Wilson, Ben Youngs, Owen Farrell, Anthony Watson.", "description": "Manu Tuilagi has been rested for England\u2019s second match at the Rugby World Cup against the United States\u00a0with Eddie Jones making 10 changes, though Billy Vunipola retains his place to start his 11th international Test in a row.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/07/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
