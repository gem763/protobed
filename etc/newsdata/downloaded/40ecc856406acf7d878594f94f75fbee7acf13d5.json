Those ruthless swooping demons are extremely aggressive during this time of year as they defend their nests with gusto around gardens, schoolyards and parks. So is it legal to kill one of these angry birds before it pecks an eye out?\n\nMagpies like building their nests in areas with short grass and tall trees, which means you'll frequently see them at parks where kids become easy pickings. Magpies will swoop down like death from above and, if they're extra feisty, will peck and scratch their victims.\n\nIf you're unlucky enough to live in a magpie-infested area, the thought of sending a few of these pesky birds to an early grave might have crossed your mind at one stage or another: one well-aimed stone or air rifle pellet could put an end to the terror for years to come.\n\nGenerally speaking, killing native animals is illegal in Australia unless you have a licence or relevant authorisation to do so. This applies to magpies as well.\n\nHowever, in states that don't consider magpies a protected animal, culling initiated by the appropriate government authorities is totally fine. For example, in ACT the magpie is not protected and the state's Parks and Conservation deparment has begun a magpie cull after several incidents of the birds stealing food from residents.\n\nIn New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, culling the birds is not permitted and even removing a magpie nest is considered illegal.\n\nWhile exceptions are occasionally made by local councils when a bird proves dangerously aggressive, you're not allowed to take the law into your own hands. In some states, the penalty for killing native birds without a permit can exceed $10,000 per bird.\n\nIt also important to remember that magpies, despite their tenancy to attack humans, are not inherently evil and are only trying to protect their territory. They may be a huge nuisance (and the stuff of nightmares for children who do get attacked), but they have an important place in the Australian environment as they act as an agent for pest control by preying on small insects like mosquito.\n\nThe good news is that magpie season only lasts for about six to eight weeks. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has provided some tips to avoid magpie attacks:\n\nAvoid the nest area and take a slight detour. (Most birds will only swoop within a 50 metre range of their nest).\n\nWear a broad-brimmed hat. (Magpies do not like to be watched. Try sticking \u201ceyes\u201d on the back of your hat).\n\nWear glasses to protect your eyes.\n\nTravel in a group (swooping birds generally target individuals).\n\nWalk quickly away from the area. Do not run.\n\nCarry an open umbrella above your head.\n\nYou can find out more about how magpies are protected in your state or territory at the following links:\n\nFive Myths About Magpies You Need To Stop Believing Magpie season is currently in full swing (or should that be swoop?) with dozens of parks and playgrounds descending into avian war zones.
