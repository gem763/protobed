A 50-week jail term was imposed in the UK after he had jumped previous bail by going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nThe WikiLeaks founder would have been released from HMP Belmarsh on 22 September, Westminster magistrates court heard on Friday, but he was told he would be kept in jail because of \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d for believing he would abscond again.\n\nAssange, 48, who is an Australian citizen, appeared by video-link wearing a loose-fitting T-shirt.\n\nDistrict judge Vanessa Baraitser told him: \u201cYou have been produced today because your sentence of imprisonment is about to come to an end. When that happens your remand status changes from a serving prisoner to a person facing extradition.\n\n\u201cTherefore I have given your lawyer an opportunity to make an application for bail on your behalf and she has declined to do so, perhaps not surprisingly in light of your history of absconding in these proceedings.\n\n\u201cIn my view I have substantial ground for believing if I release you, you will abscond again.\u201d\n\nAssange was asked if he understood what was happening. He replied: \u201cNot really. I\u2019m sure the lawyers will explain it.\u201d\n\nAnother administrative hearing will take place on 11 October and a case management hearing on 21 October, the court heard. The final extradition hearing is expected in February.\n\nAssange entered the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted in connection with sexual offence allegations.He spent nearly seven years living in the building until police dragged him out in April after Ecuador revoked his political asylum.", "description": "WikiLeaks founder\u2019s custody will be extended after current prison terms comes to end", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0d4c06e1c45d407b959d8acffa238626bd8985/0_318_4169_2501/master/4169.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a7c9bd644c6c33d13dca63b0d7f6949", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
