His new video for \u201cSouth of the Border,\u201d the No. 6 Collaborations Project track featuring Camila Cabello and Cardi B, is nearly four minutes of spy thriller action, plus a good 45 seconds of classic Cardi antics at the end. Along with Sheeran, Cabello and Cardi (\u201cas Cardi B\u201d), the \u201cfrivolous spy film\u201d also stars social media influencer Alexis Ren and Veronica Mars actor Paul Karmiryan. (In fact, it\u2019s out the same day as Cabello\u2019s third single for her second solo album, the breakup anthem \u201cCry for Me.\u201d)\n\nWe can\u2019t totally follow the plot, but we do know that it shows multiple moments that can only be described as iconic, from Ren kidnapping Sheeran and stealing his necklace to Cabello obviously stage-punching Karmiryan to Cardi rapping with her hands tied. As the credits roll, it becomes the Cardi B Show, with the rapper picking up the necklace and a walkie-talkie from the scene of the crime. \u201cYou know I\u2019m crazy!\u201d she tells Sheeran over the walkie. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you thought it was a good idea to kidnap me.\u201d Agreed!", "description": "In his new music video for \u201cSouth of the Border,\u201d featuring Camila Cabello and Cardi B, Ed Sheeran is the star of a \u201cfrivolous spy film.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-ed-sheeran.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
