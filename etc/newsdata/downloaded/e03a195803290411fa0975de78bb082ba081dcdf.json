An ocean of blood. I wondered how many blood drops of blood there are in this blood ocean. I wondered how much is in... in a drop. I wondered, how I - let\u2019s just say there are possibly... Take this, and multiply by the volume of the water in the ocean, \u2018cause it\u2019s blood, a blood ocean, and the water... I found, I found it out, there\u2019s trillions of litres- (Screenshot: NBC/WHO-TV)\n\nA family of seven in Bagley, Iowa, had the nightmarish experience of finding their basement had turned into Blood Ocean courtesy of the meatpacking plant next door, WHO-TV of Des Moines reported this week.\n\nNick Lestina told the broadcaster his family had lived next to Dahl\u2019s Custom Meat Locker for a decade without any issues, but that the facility had recently come under new ownership before flooding their basement on October 3 with nearly 13 centimetres of animal blood and various scraps like fat and bone. The facility had apparently used a floor drain to wash away fluids from a recent livestock slaughter, unaware that it was connected to Lestina\u2019s basement.\n\nNick Lestina, basement filled with blood. (Screenshot: NBC/WHO-TV)\n\nAccording to the Des Moine Register, Kaitlin Dahl said the facility uses a catch drain to catch most of the blood for proper disposal, but that a small amount is \u201callowed by the county\u201d to go down a back drain on the floor. Investigators have determined that a tile line is connected to both buildings, with a break or clog resulting in blood flowing back into the family home.\n\nThe Iowa Department of National Resources confirmed both that it was investigating the case and that the blood would have kept rising had Lestina not had a sump pump installed, WHO-TV wrote.\n\n\u201c[Dahl\u2019s] haven\u2019t reached out at all,\u201d Lestina told WHO-TV. \u201cIn fact, they haven\u2019t taken any accountability for it. They say it\u2019s not their fault and told me \u2018good luck.\u2019 If I want to do anything about it, it\u2019s on my dime and my schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking into thousands of dollars with cleanup, over 2,000 just to sanitise the basement,\u201d Lestina added. \u201cI don\u2019t have thousands of dollars to throw away at this... No one wants to see that, smell that. I wouldn\u2019t want that for anybody in their house.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Register reported that Dahl\u2019s had reached out on Thursday following the WHO-TV segment and newspaper coverage.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to harm anybody,\u201d Kaitlin Dahl told the Register. \u201cWe\u2019re not bad people. We\u2019re trying to make a living, not enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meat locker from my standpoint has been pretty cooperative,\u201d Iowa DNR senior environment specialist Kevin Wilken told WHO-TV. \u201cThey have worked with me to come up with a permanent solution so the animal blood, fat and all that stuff is no longer discarded down those floor drains.\u201d", "description": "A family of seven in Bagley, Iowa, had the nightmarish experience of finding their basement had turned into Blood Ocean courtesy of the meatpacking plant next door, WHO-TV of Des Moines reported this week....", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "George Dvorsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qsuljbu2rw6rswc3dc8z.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
