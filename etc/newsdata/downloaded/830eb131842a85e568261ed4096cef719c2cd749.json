Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is \u201ctoo old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t think the same country that elected Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a woman would win,\u201d said Beck, 68. \u201cI just saw how they beat up on Hillary Clinton, and I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re going to do the same thing to [Warren].\u201d\n\nJohnny James, 53, of Hampton County, S.C., said that despite Warren\u2019s ability to attract big crowds, he prefers Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s already seasoned,\u201d James said. \u201cHe knows the Washington game.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have stepped up their attacks on Biden in recent weeks, noting that his son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian company while Biden was spearheading the Obama administration\u2019s Ukraine policy. But many Democrats continue to consider Biden to have the best chance of defeating Trump, and for a significant portion that is the overriding factor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShedron Williams, a state representative from Hampton, S.C., predicted that \u201cBiden is going to do well in South Carolina.\u201d Williams has not endorsed the former vice president, but said he continues to be popular among black voters.\n\n\u201cWhoever is going to win South Carolina, it\u2019s going to take the African American vote,\u201d Williams said.\n\nPolls back up that contention. In South Carolina, 37 percent of Democrats in a recent CNN poll said they support Biden, who leads Warren by more than 20 percentage points in the state.\n\nThe ongoing support for Biden has emerged as one of the campaign\u2019s central story lines, even as he\u2019s come under attack from rivals such as Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) for his onetime work with segregationists, and as former Housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro has made comments that struck some as questioning Biden\u2019s mental acuity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Biden\u2019s rivals hope that if he stumbles in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary, Democrats in states like South Carolina, which votes a short time later, will reconsider their support.\n\nBut James noted that South Carolina is the first primary state with a significant number of African American voters and said he would consider Biden the best candidate even if he doesn\u2019t win any primary states before South Carolina.\n\n\u201cYou can come in second and still be stronger than the first horse,\u201d James said. \u201cEven if someone else wins [Iowa or New Hampshire], that doesn\u2019t say how you\u2019ll do with black voters.\u201d\n\nBiden over his career has forged strong ties in South Carolina and especially with African Americans, who make up nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State. He frequently vacations on Kiawah Island, a spot in the lowcountry near Charleston where residents got a semiannual glimpse of the vice presidential motorcade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden also has decades of relationships with South Carolinians. He counts Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) as a close friend. At Clyburn\u2019s annual fish fry in June, a South Carolina mainstay for those who want to be president, Biden shook hands and took photos along a rope line until nearly midnight. He was the last presidential candidate to leave.\n\nMaria Washington, 64, of Charleston, said she was a Biden fan well before then.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ride or die Biden,\u201d she said as she ate a barbecue lunch Saturday at the Blue Jamboree. \u201cI look at each of them and what they have done. . . . Biden has been on an even keel for 40 years.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s friend, Hermine Hawkins, who like Washington is black, said her questions about whether Biden would be good for African Americans were answered when President Barack Obama selected him as a running mate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf Barack Obama pulled him on his team, there\u2019s some validity there,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, critics have been particularly vocal in recent weeks, and Biden has faced threats to his presidential aspirations from multiple fronts.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, using his strongest language yet, in an offensive that came as Trump has inundated Twitter with false claims about the Bidens and Ukraine. That same day, the president\u2019s reelection campaign announced a $10 million ad buy targeting Biden and focused on early-voting states.\n\nMeanwhile, Warren has gained strength, sometimes attracting large crowds to her events, something Biden has struggled to do.\n\nAD\n\nBut those setbacks have not significantly dented Biden\u2019s support. That\u2019s in large measure because his closest rivals, Warren and Sanders, have had trouble winning the backing of black voters.\n\nAD\n\nFor Biden\u2019s Palmetto State supporters, the question is whether he can win there in a way that propels him for the contests that follow. The Feb. 29 South Carolina primary is followed on March 3 by Super Tuesday, featuring a diverse slate of 16 states that includes North Carolina, Alabama and California.\n\nWilliams, the state representative, predicted that Biden\u2019s success in South Carolina \u201cis going to send a message to the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "As he faces attacks from all sides, signs are that former vice president Joe Biden maintains a solid base of support, especially among African Americans.", "authors": ["Cleve R.
