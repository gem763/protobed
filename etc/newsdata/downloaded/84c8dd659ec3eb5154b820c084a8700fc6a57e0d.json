Traditional windmills first appeared in Australia in the late 1800s and soon became a symbol of the country's bushland because of their ability to provide a permanent water supply. But in recent years new power supplies like electric submersible pumps and solar pumps are being introduced to perform the same purpose Owen Tydd said he was happy with the old-fashioned technology being replaced as it saved him from having to climb windmills Windmills are different to the modern wind turbines, which convert wind into practical energy, rather than grind gain and pump water\n\nWindmills were once commonplace across the Australian outback - providing a vital function by milling grain and pumping groundwater.\n\nBut with the advent of new technologies, the iconic structures are now becoming obsolete.\n\nThe rise of new technologies have led to power sources like solar panels gradually replacing windmills.\n\nWith the advent of new technologies, the iconic structures are now becoming obsolete\n\nThe rise of new technologies have led to power sources like solar panels gradually replacing windmills\n\n'They (windmills) are all becoming fairly old, with new windmills available but not a lot being put up,' he said\n\n'They (windmills) are all becoming fairly old, with new windmills available but not a lot being put up,' he said.\n\n\u2018This is sort of forcing the obsolescence of windmills, even though I believe the technology still has a lot to offer\u2019.\n\n'The thought pattern at present is if you want to put something new in to pump water, you either put in an electric submersible pump, or a solar pump.'\n\n'The thought pattern at present is if you want to put something new in to pump water, you either put in an electric submersible pump, or a solar pump,' he said\n\nDespite his training in windmills, Mr Tydd said he happily welcomes the technological change\n\nBut despite his training in windmills, Mr Tydd said he happily welcomes the technological change.\n\n'Because I am just about to retire, I am not going to argue about that.
