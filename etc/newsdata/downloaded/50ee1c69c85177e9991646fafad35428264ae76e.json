Source: Facebook\n\nJust hours after finding out she was pregnant, Caity Mason began active labour with a baby she was unknowingly growing while partying, playing sport and drinking alcohol over Christmas and New Year.\n\nThe 25-year-old Melbourne woman had even been having her regular monthly period, and showed no physical sign of being pregnant whatsoever, she told The Sunday Project.\n\nWhen she saw her doctor on January 21 complaining of stomach cramps, she was told she was in fact 35 weeks and five days into a pregnancy and 10 centimetres dilated.\n\nShe was taken straight to hospital in the early hours of the following morning, and gave birth to her son, Flynn, the next day.\n\nREAD MORE: Britain's biggest family announces baby number 22\n\nMs Mason announced her shock news to Facebook from her hospital bed, telling friends and family she was equally as surprised as them.\n\n\u201cSo I have some very big news! Much to my surprise I\u2019m expecting a baby....no joke! Needless to say I\u2019ll be here till further notice. I\u2019m very excited and shocked but i have great support around me,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is my journey and my decision and I\u2019d ask you to keep your questions and options to yourself.\u201d\n\nIn an update on January 23, she shared an album of photos of baby Flynn, who was born at 5.18pm weighing 2.79kg.\n\n\u201cNew Year\u2019s and Christmas I spent on the Murray River skiing and knee boarding, wakeboarding, tubing; everything that you shouldn\u2019t be doing. I played netball all through my pregnancy - rough games of netball,\u201d she told host Lisa Wilkinson.\n\nShe said being pregnant was the furthest thing from her mind, having drunk \u201ccopious\u201d amounts of alcohol at festive and birthday celebrations.\n\nThis all changed very quickly after she was told of the news of her surprise baby and was forced to drastically adjust her lifestyle overnight.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman aged 75 thought to be 'world's oldest mother'\n\nFlynn\u2019s dad opted not to be involved putting additional weight to the new mum\u2019s shoulders, but fortunately she had a sturdy support network in close friends and family.\n\nMs Mason has credited Flynn\u2019s birth for bringing added stability and purpose to her life, much like another Australian mum Erin Bussenschutt who also gave birth shortly after finding out she was pregnant.\n\nErin Bussenschutt shown about five months pregnant (left) and almost seven months pregnant (right).
