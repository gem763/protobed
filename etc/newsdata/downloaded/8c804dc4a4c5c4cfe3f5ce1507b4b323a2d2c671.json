NETFLIX\n\nTemperatures may still be in the 80s and 90s, but it's actually October out there.\n\nThe month of pumpkin everything, Halloween costumes, falling leaves and haunted houses has arrived, and with it a bunch of new TV series and movies to watch on streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and HBO Now.\n\nTo keep us entertained as we hide inside from the fall heat wave, we've picked out two TV series and three movies worth watching this month, whether you're in a sporty mood because of football or you want to laugh yourself silly or just see some pretty houses.\n\nBest actress, comedy: Catherine O\u2019Hara, \"Schitt's Creek,\" Pop TV (Photo: CBC Television, Pop TV)\n\nIf you want clever, delightful humor: 'Schitt's Creek'\n\nThe fifth season of Pop TV's sitcom arrives on Netflix just after it garnered a slew of Emmy nominations, giving you the perfect excuse to catch up if you haven't yet. The story of a wealthy family who loses everything and is forced to move to the small town of Schitt's Creek, a hamlet that's anything but quaint, is one of the funniest shows on TV. And if you catch up now, you'll be ready for next year's sixth and final season.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nIf you want to zone out: 'House Hunters'\n\nTwo new seasons of HGTV's reliably entertaining reality series have arrived on Hulu, which is great news for us obsessives who have already seen all the other episodes online. If you've never seen \"House Hunters,\" it's a perfectly pleasant show about people looking to buy or rent houses and apartments all over the U.S. (try \"International\" for residences around the globe). The series both allows you to fantasize about your dream home and feel superior over the hunters who choose the wrong abode.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nCameron Diaz (from left), Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore kick butt and save the world in \"Charlie's Angels.\" (Photo: ABBOT GENSER/ARTISAN ENTERTAINMENT)\n\nIf you're excited about Elizabeth Banks' 'Charlie's Angels' remake: 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'\n\nBefore Banks and Kristen Stewart tackled the classic female spy story, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu made it a sensation. Although the early 2000s films seem a bit dated and cheesy now (especially \"Full Throttle\"), they are solid action movies anchored by bonafide stars with killer soundtracks (thanks, Destiny's Child). The new film has a lot to live up to in comparison.\n\nStream them on Netflix.\n\nNicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor starred in Baz Luhrmann's 2001 jukebox musical \"Moulin Rouge!\" (Photo: Sue Adler, 20th Century Fox)\n\nIf you want a musical: 'Moulin Rouge!'\n\nIf red and orange leaves and pumpkin picking make you want to burst out into autumnal song, might we suggest heading over to HBO to watch Baz Luhrmann's dazzling jukebox musical, \"Moulin Rouge!\" Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are young and beautiful as doomed lovers Satine and Christian in a film that celebrates all thing excess. Good luck getting \"Lady Marmalade\" out of your head after watching.\n\nStream it on HBO Go/Now.\n\nIf you want something sporty: 'Hoosiers'\n\nFootball season and baseball playoffs may be the sports that keep us going during the fall, but the NBA season kicks off this month too. Amazon is now streaming \"Hoosiers,\" arguably the greatest sports movie ever made, about a troubled high school basketball coach and the small town team looking for statewide glory. Gene Hackman anchors this inspiring, entirely uncynical film that you should watch at least once in your life.\n\nStream it on Amazon.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/05/netflix-hulu-amazon-hbo-streaming-tv-movies-october-2019/3774228002/", "description": "From \"Schitt's Creek\" to \"Moulin Rouge!\" to \"Charlie's Angels,\" Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and HBO have great offerings in October.", "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
