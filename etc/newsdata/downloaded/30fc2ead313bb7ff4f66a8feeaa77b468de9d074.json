My wife is a teacher and has a steady career, grossing $68,000 a year. We have no children, and have total savings (retirement and other accounts) of $350,000. We owe $250,000 on a $500,000 home that is in good condition. My life-insurance policy is worth approximately $1 million, and I have minimal health-care costs.\n\n\u2018While I understand her position, it seems a bit conservative to me and I\u2019m frustrated at her absolute opposition.\u2019\n\nWith my limited time left, I want to invest in a new kitchen \u2014 both as a gift to my wife and as something positive and new to lift my spirits, since I\u2019m largely confined to our home and spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Given the numbers, I do not see much risk in investing between $50,000 and $75,000 on a new kitchen.\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, is vehemently opposed to spending any of our savings given my certain demise in the next decade. While I understand her position, it seems a bit conservative to me, and I\u2019m frustrated at her absolute opposition.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nLoving husband in Tacoma, Wash.\n\nDear Husband,\n\nThank you for your letter and for sharing your story. I\u2019m on your side. I\u2019m also on your wife\u2019s side. It\u2019s a good sign that you are having this discussion and, no doubt, it will be the first of many issues related to your illness that you will need to navigate. Start as you mean to continue.\n\nIf you\u2019re spending time alone at home for the foreseeable future, it makes sense that you would want to be comfortable at home. Before spending money on your kitchen, make sure you don\u2019t need to allocate money for other adjustments to prepare for any lack of mobility related to your illness. Do you have enough room downstairs for a bedroom if the stairs become unmanageable and a bathroom that will suit your needs? What adjustments could you make to your kitchen that would not cost as much as $50,000 and also might appease your wife?\n\n\u2018Whatever is really going on here, it\u2019s not only about the kitchen. It\u2019s never just about the kitchen.\u2019\n\nBefore I get into the logistics of kitchen costs and house values and savings and financial security, I wanted to say one thing: Whatever is really going on here, it\u2019s not only about the kitchen. It\u2019s never just about the kitchen. Whenever I focus on some material issue that I need to change, I try \u2014 not always successfully \u2014 to remind myself that whatever it is I want to change or improve or purchase represents some other issue that I haven\u2019t quite figured out yet. It may also represent something different to your wife. She may be living with the fear of losing you and anxious about life after you\u2019ve gone, and a major change or upheaval could be the last thing she wants right now.\n\nReading stories like yours also gives me perspective on my own life. We are the canned beans, and often times we need others to tell us what\u2019s written on the can. Answering your letter and contemplating your predicament and your relationship helps me, too. Believe it or not, when I am faced with a big decision or I need to advocate for myself on a financial matter and my own emotions get in the way, I ask myself, \u201cWhat would the Moneyist advise me to do?\u201d Of course, I can\u2019t ask myself, but I ask a friend who will be that person for me. So thank you for choosing me to be that person \u2014 or one of those people \u2014 for you.\n\nSeek outside help from a professional to help ensure this issue isn\u2019t a proxy for other issues related to your condition. I don\u2019t know whether your existing kitchen is badly in need of renovations and/or is falling apart, or whether it\u2019s a perfectly serviceable room that could be turbocharged with gadgets and, to quote the realtor, \u201call mod cons.\u201d I\u2019ll leave that for you two to figure out. But I have some questions: Will having such a project also give you something outside of yourself and your illness to focus on? Will it mean you have something bearing your own personal stamp that you can leave behind for your wife? If so, I can certainly understand that.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My elderly father refuses to use his oxygen tank \u2014 will our stepmother get all his money if he dies without a will?\n\nI also wonder whether this is part of a pattern. Is this a dynamic between two strong-willed people that repeats itself? That may be a negative or a positive thing. Perhaps you both enjoy locking horns and finding issues to wrestle over. That could be how you bonded when you first met, or that might be how you were raised \u2014 to argue things out. It could be a stimulating game in which you take turns winning game, set and match. Or it could be an unhealthy part of your relationship that this dream kitchen project gives you an opportunity to address. Perhaps the real remodeling needs to take place on your communication styles and willingness to hear each other out.\n\nRecommended: A letter from a reader on the poverty line: \u2018I know what it means to go hungry for five days until you get your next paycheck\u2019\n\nI have one more question for you. Would this project give you something you can start and finish before you die? It is big enough for you to feel a great deal of satisfaction when it is complete. After all, this is where you talk and eat, and probably feel most at home in the world. It would be a gift to your wife \u2014 if she did not regret spending the money and was able to sit in it on a rainy Sunday afternoon and think of you. It would not be such a gift if you won her over and she found herself worrying about money, drinking a cup of tea on an expensive marble surface while nursing a resentment. I don\u2019t think either of you would want that.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to leave your wife with a white elephant or an alabaster albatross around her neck.\n\nYou are embarking on a journey together. The good news: All things considered, you\u2019re in great financial shape. Homeowners spend roughly up $33,000 on a new kitchen, but this varies dramatically by city and region. In fact, TheSpruce.com says it can cost $200 to $250 per square foot for a mid-range kitchen in the Pacific Northwest or $300 per square foot for a high-end kitchen. So it may be that any kitchen renovation will run at the higher end of the scale. Your wife may not live in this house forever, so it would be wise to consult a real-estate agent to see how much of that would add value to your home if your wife decided to sell it after you\u2019ve gone. You don\u2019t want to leave her with a white elephant or \u2014 to stick with the animal metaphor \u2014 an alabaster albatross around her neck.\n\nSeek out a financial manager. You need a third-party, objective opinion to discuss all financial end-of-life issues with your wife \u2014 including your life insurance, your retirement and other expenses she will face alone after you\u2019ve gone. You need to see this kitchen renovation in the context of all of your other financial commitments. I also recommend that you see a counselor and/or seek out group therapy to talk about how you would like to spend the years you have left. Perhaps there are places you have always wanted to go as a couple, or academic courses or retreats that you have always wanted to take. It may be that you put a modest pot of gold aside for this.\n\nSome couples are fortunate enough to experience old age together. Others lose their partner without warning, and are left with so many things that have gone unsaid. You have the opportunity to find common ground and draw up a road map for the time you have left, and that is no small gift.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
