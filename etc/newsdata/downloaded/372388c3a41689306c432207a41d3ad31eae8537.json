But that\u2019s not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well-made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\nHis comments drew a slew of backlash, including from some of the writers and directors of the films he criticized.\n\nBut for Coppola, Scorsese was being too kind.\n\n\u201cWhen Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right, because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration,\u201d Coppola said while speaking to a journalist in Lyon. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same move over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJames Gunn, who directed the Guardians of the Galaxy, took to Instagram on Sunday to argue that Scorsese and Coppola essentially were repeating the same line of criticism that older generations gave them when they were younger.\n\nHe noted that gangster movies, which have been closely associated with Coppola and Scorsese, were once called \u201cdespicable\u201d by \u201cour grandfathers,\u201d who also regarded the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone as \u201cexactly the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome superhero films are awful, some are beautiful,\u201d Gunn wrote. \u201cLike westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that's okay.\u201d\n\nFox News' Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Director Francis Ford Coppola some angry rebukes this weekend after he went a step further than Martin Scorsese in his criticism of Marvel superhero movies, calling them \u201cdespicable.\u201d", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
