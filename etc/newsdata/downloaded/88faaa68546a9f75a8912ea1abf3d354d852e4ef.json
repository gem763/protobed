The company, founded in 2011, was born out of Minshew's personal frustration at the shortcomings of other job-search platforms.\n\n\"I was going on all of the job boards that everyone's familiar with, and it was such a frustrating experience. You type something in the search box and you'd get 5,732 results and they all looked exactly the same,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nMinshew thought a career site \"that told better stories about the jobs\" companies offer would attract more qualified candidates, as well as better match people's skills and interests with those positions.\n\nThe Muse aims to do just that. It seeks to provide job seekers with insight into a an employer's culture, including through employee testimonials, office photos and the latest company news. The site also offers free career advice, while for a fee (starting at $49) you can get one-on-one coaching sessions on topics such as negotiating a raise or promotion.\n\nBelieving in possibility\n\nWhile these founders' own dilemma led to them building a successful startup, they acknowledge they are outliers, and that even securing funding was a long-shot. In 2012, they were admitted to Y Combinator's accelerator program and received $1.2 million in seed funding from the tech incubator and other sources.\n\nCavoulacos is upfront about the challenges of building a company from scratch. She warns aspiring entrepreneurs that most startups fail, underscoring how hard it is to convince potential investors that your company is an exception.\n\n\"I think investors saying 'yes' is a momentary lapse in judgment for any early-stage company, because most early-stage startups fail,\" she said. \"So you need to figure out how to get people to that momentary lapse of judgment...because there are a hundred reasons why you might fail. You need to get them to believe in the one reason you might not.\"", "description": "The career services site, born out of frustration, seeks to gives job seekers an inside look at potential employers", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/548fc03b-f7c1-4e05-91d5-03a95f70969c/thumbnail/1200x630/369c92e15326aeefc2cb344f9b714764/screen-shot-2019-09-11-at-11-55-40-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
