The company is also being sued by adults and underage Juul users who claim they became addicted to nicotine through the company\u2019s products. And the Trump administration has proposed banning nearly all vaping flavors.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s latest step is unlikely to satisfy its critics.\n\nThe flavors affected by Thursday\u2019s announcement \u2014 mango, cr\u00e8me, fruit and cucumber \u2014 account for less than 10% of Juul\u2019s sales. The flavors had only been sold through Juul\u2019s website, after the company pulled them from stores last November.\n\nJuul will continue selling its most popular flavors, mint and menthol, for now. A spokesman said the company is reviewing its products and has not made \u201cany final decisions.\u201d\n\nMint and menthol account for most of Juul\u2019s retail sales, according to analysts, and are the most popular flavors among teens.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company will also continue to sell its tobacco-flavored vaping pods.\n\nThe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids\u2019 Matthew Myers said that Juul\u2019s decision to keep selling mint and menthol shows \u201cit isn\u2019t serious about preventing youth use.\u201d\n\n\u201cJuul knows that 64% of high school e-cigarette users now use mint or menthol flavors and this number is growing all the time,\u201d Myers said in a statement.\n\nHis group and others are urging the Trump administration to follow through on its proposal to ban all vaping flavors except tobacco.\n\nThe sales concession comes less than a month after a major shake-up at the privately held firm, in which it pledged to stop advertising and agreed to not lobby against the administration\u2019s proposed flavor ban.\n\n\u201cWe must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers and stakeholders,\u201d the company\u2019s new CEO, K.C. Crosthwaite, said in a statement. Crosthwaite was named CEO last month. He previously worked as an executive for Marlboro-maker Altria, which is also Juul\u2019s biggest investor.\n\nThis week\u2019s move marks a remarkable shift for Juul, which had argued for years that its flavors help adult smokers quit cigarettes.\n\nBut the announcement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the permanent end of Juul\u2019s flavors. Instead, Crosthwaite said the company would defer to the decision of the Food and Drug Administration, which has set a deadline of next May for manufacturers to submit their vaping products for federal review.\n\nUnder the agency\u2019s standards, only vaping products that represent a net benefit to public health are supposed to remain on the market.\n\nIf the company can show that its products are less harmful than cigarettes and can help adults switch, they could presumably return. Many experts, however, doubt the company will be able to win the FDA endorsement, given the popularity of Juul among underage users.\n\nUnderage vaping has reached epidemic levels, according to health officials. In the latest government survey, more than 1 in 4 high school students reported using e-cigarettes in the previous month despite federal law banning sales to those under 18.\n\nWhile Juul agreed to stop lobbying against a flavor ban, other industry players haven\u2019t. The Vapor Technology Association is launching a national marketing campaign aimed at stopping the White House plan by using the slogan, \u201cI vape, I vote.\u201d\n\nA poll released Thursday shows that Americans narrowly favor banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, although younger adults are more likely to oppose the idea.\n\nBanning flavors is supported by 52% of adults of all ages and opposed by 44%, according to the poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. But 63% of adults ages 18 to 29 oppose banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nThe poll involved random calls to the cellphones and landlines of 1,205 adults and was conducted Oct. 3-8. The margin of sampling error for all respondents was plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nIn a separate public health crisis, the federal government is investigating nearly 1,500 cases of lung damage linked to vaping, some of them fatal. Many patients said they vaped THC, marijuana\u2019s intoxicating chemical, with bootleg devices, but officials have not yet implicated any common product or ingredient.\n\n___\n\nAP medical writer Carla K.
