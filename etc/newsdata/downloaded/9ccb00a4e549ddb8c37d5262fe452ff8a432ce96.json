If carried out, the plan would trap more than 2.5 million Palestinians in dislocated enclaves surrounded by Israel.\n\nThe move, for decades considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood, was condemned by Arab countries, the UN and the EU as an illegal land grab.\n\nNetanyahu is battling for his political survival, and the announcement was interpreted as a rallying cry to his hardline rightwing base.\n\nGantz has said he also supports annexation and accused Netanyahu of stealing his idea. \u201cWe are happy that Netanyahu has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognise the Jordan Valley,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Palestinian protester uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli troops in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDahlia Scheindlin, a Tel-Aviv based political analyst and a public opinion expert, said annexation was popular with the rightwing voters Netanyahu was courting. \u201cOverall, Israeli support for sovereignty in the West Bank is substantial,\u201d the pollster wrote.\n\nShe said Netanyahu\u2019s stance that not a single Palestinian living there would be given citizenship \u2013 and therefore voting rights \u2013 was critical to the support. \u201cThe public only unites against annexation when they realise Palestinians swept up in sovereignty might be equal to Israelis,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Likud party has equally focused on Israel\u2019s internal Arab minority, Palestinians who managed to stay on their land during Israel\u2019s creation in 1948 and now account for up to a fifth of the population. Netanyahu sought to pass legislation this month that would allow political parties to put cameras in polling stations \u2013 a move condemned as voter intimidation, especially against Arabs.\n\nNetanyahu has also warned, without evidence, that his opponents are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. And on Thursday Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on Netanyahu\u2019s official page after it breached the company\u2019s hate speech policy by sending visitors a message warning of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu used similar tactics in previous elections, particularly in 2015 when he claimed that Arabs were voting \u201cin droves\u201d. A columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper said the Facebook scandal, however, was the nadir of what was \u201cthe nastiest, most racist campaign ever\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Democratic Union supporters protest against Netanyahu outside the Knesset: \u201cWe won\u2019t allow the forger to steal the election.\u201d Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Media\n\n\u201cThe plunge to the bottom of the sewer, the dive into the depths of the morass that we\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks \u2013 it has all come straight from the top,\u201d wrote Yossi Verter.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote will be the second election held in five months after a political crisis in May scuppered the newly elected Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.\n\nNetanyahu appeared to have won the ballot in April when he and rightwing parliamentary allies came out ahead. However, his attempts to form a coalition government failed over disagreements between Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties and secular politicians.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, a former defence minister and leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, had sought guarantees that ultra-Orthodox religious students, who are largely exempt from conscription, would be forced to serve in the army.\n\nEventually, Netanyahu forced the Knesset to dissolve, triggering repeat elections and giving him another chance.\n\nLieberman, a Netanyahu ally-turned-rival, appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the second election. His public dispute with religious leaders has led to a jump in popularity, and it seems he could gather enough seats to become a kingmaker.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, speaks during an election panel. Photograph: Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnalysts are predicting a relatively low turnout this time around, with voters not keen on having two elections in one year. Netanyahu published a poll on Twitter on Friday that showed Blue and White marginally ahead. \u201cAnyone who wants a rightwing government must go out and vote,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prime minister still faces three corruption scandals \u2013 charges he denies. Pre-trial hearings are to begin next month.\n\nTo win votes he has sought to play up his security credentials and international acumen, boasting of his close relationship with and influence on Donald Trump. That image took a hit this week after Trump suggested he would consider meeting the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. Israel has sought to isolate its regional enemy.\n\nA Thursday report by the news outlet Politico, which cited US officials as saying Israel was likely to have planted spying devices near the White House, has also come at a bad time for Netanyahu as it raises the prospect of adding tension to US-Israeli relations. Both Israel and the US have officially denied the claims.", "description": "\u2018Nastiest, most racist campaign ever\u2019 as Likud shores up vote with divisive pledges", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c950c2e8a090a6408e76388aa4b2e901040927/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31844d00b8caac19eecdcfeec3322bfb", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
