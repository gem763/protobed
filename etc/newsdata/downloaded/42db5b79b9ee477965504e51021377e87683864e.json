And if we don\u2019t go along, we will be punished by our own children.\u201d\n\nThe show then cut to Ms. Thunberg\u2019s United Nations speech Monday, telling the room: \u201cYoung people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all the future generations are upon you. And if you choose to say less, I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. The world is waking up. And change is coming whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nWhen back on camera, Ms. Ingraham asked, \u201cDoes anyone else find that chilling?\u201d\n\nMs. Ingraham then played a clip from the 1984 version of \u201cChildren of the Corn\u201d where the murder cult leader says \u201ca test is at hand. The final test.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Stephen King\u2019s sequel, Children of the Climate,\u201d Ms. Ingraham said. \u201cNow the left, if they ever get in power, will simply use the excuse of climate change to reward their friends and punish their enemies.\u201d\n\nHours before her monologue, Fox News apologized after a guest on their show called Ms. Thunberg a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child.\u201d\n\nDuring a segment on Fox News\u2019 The Story with Martha MacCallum, The Daily Wire\u2019s Michael Knowles blasted Ms. Thunberg, who has autism, and accused the \u201cinternational left and her parents\u201d of \u201cexploiting\u201d her.\n\n\u201cThe comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful - we apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers,\u201d Fox News said, according to Mediaite.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
