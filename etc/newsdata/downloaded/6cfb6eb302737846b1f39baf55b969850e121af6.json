Life is wild!\n\nKylie Jenner\u2019s life is extremely dramatic at the moment (I mean, I guess it always is) thanks to news of her breakup with Travis Scott taking over the internet. But more important, Kylie was apparently seen visiting her ex-boyfriend Tyga\u2019s recording studio late Tuesday night, which has basically caused the entire internet to spiral.\n\nPhoto credit: James Devaney - Getty Images More\n\n2019 has been a truly wild year (please see: our current political situation), but news of Kylie reuniting with her ex might just be what breaks us. And the reaction on Twitter is equal parts hilarious and \u201cIS THIS REAL LIFE HOW IS THIS EVEN HAPPENING.\u201d Mostly because Tyga and Kylie had a notoriously messy relationship and breakup\u2014like, remember when he took credit for her Lip Kits? Yeah.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s a sampling of people on Twitter doing the most to either brighten or ruin your day!\n\n3 years ago Tyga said this. \ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/wJJtArqmNY \u2014 Benjamin Enfield (@BenjaminEnfield) October 3, 2019\n\nTyga after hearing about Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott breaking up\n\npic.twitter.com/JOqcrTc9Hr \u2014 NC \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf83 (@NewCuIture) October 3, 2019\n\nKylie when Travis confronts her reunion with Tyga \ud83d\ude02 #KylieJenner pic.twitter.com/RQpRRGsiAh \u2014 Mint Phresh (@mint_phresh) October 3, 2019\n\nKris Jenner calling TMZ after tracking Kylie's car to Tyga's house pic.twitter.com/m7JrbYRDYa \u2014 Hanna Dickinson (@hansdickie) October 3, 2019\n\nTravis : it\u2019ll be aight\n\nNews: Kylie meets up with tyga in studio\n\nTravis: pic.twitter.com/c4qj1YxqDe \u2014 nattee (@x7nathaniel) October 3, 2019\n\nMe: why is tyga trending ? \ud83e\udd14\n\n*clicks on name*\n\nAlso me: pic.twitter.com/AHFniigFAa \u2014 Marisol\ud83d\udd4a (@fromtheyay) October 3, 2019\n\nTyga with the biggest comeback of 2019 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/oHCfZ6AXNO \u2014 \u062d\u06a9\u0645\u062a (@__Hikmat) October 2, 2019\n\nTyga when he heard that Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott broke up pic.twitter.com/ycbhBAZlPq \u2014 K.

Nothing romantic is going on.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "\u201cTyga with the biggest comeback of 2019.\u201d", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W3BebId.V5TsZ7b3XBVDMg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/fff480297b008c433daacf0b222cfc87", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
