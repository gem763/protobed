According to Global Market Insights, the global biotech market is expected to reach $775 billion by 2024, up from $399.4 billion in 2017. While they tend to be more volatile, biotech stocks can offer substantial upside given the fact that a single positive catalyst can send shares soaring.\n\nFor a few biotechs, positive trial results might just be that catalyst. Wall Street analysts have pinpointed 3 biotech stocks that have seen share prices rise recently in response to new positive data. Each of these stocks has garnered support from the rest of the Street with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d analyst consensus. This consensus is generated using the last three months\u2019 worth of ratings from all other analysts.\n\nWith investors on average allocating 2%-6% of their portfolios to these biotechs based on TipRanks Smart Portfolio users, we wanted to learn more about the 3 stocks highlighted by analysts.\n\nShould you invest now? Here\u2019s the low-down.\n\nModerna Inc.\n\nModerna (MRNA- Get Report) uses messenger RNA (mRNA), or molecules that transfer the instructions needed to make proteins located in DNA, to tell patients\u2019 own cells to create proteins to treat, cure or even prevent diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases as well as other rare diseases.\n\nSince its September 12 announcement that its Phase 1 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Chikungunya programs demonstrated promising results, shares jumped 10% higher. CMV affects one in 150 newborns and can cause jaundice, poor liver function, microencephaly, pneumonia and several other symptoms. Chikungunya is spread through mosquito bites with symptoms including fever and joint pain.\n\nAccording to Needham\u2019s Alan Carr, the CMV vaccine represented a \u201cpotent vaccine and compares favorably to the that of the Merck V160 attenuated vaccine\u201d. Adding to the good news, management stated that it expects rapid progression through a Phase 2 trial to a single registration trial to test the vaccine\u2019s ability to prevent the spread of infection from pregnant women to their babies. As there currently aren\u2019t any treatments or vaccines for CMV, these results are an important milestone for MRNA.\n\nIn addition, its Chikungunya vaccine looks solid as it demonstrated antibody production similar to that of its preclinical program in non-human primates. The analyst believes this could translate to other programs in earlier stage development including methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), which Carr deems the \u201cnext clinical catalyst for the stock\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoth sets of data represent an important step forward for the company,\u201d he explained. The three-star analyst also cites its ongoing immuno-oncology programs for melanoma and ovarian cancer as important areas to watch. All of this lends itself to his conclusion that MRNA could see massive gains. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and $28 price target on September 13. He sees 55% upside potential for MRNA.\n\nWall Street appears to be on the same page. MRNA boasts significant support from the Street as it has only received Buy ratings in the last three months, giving it a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus. Its $33 average price target indicates 80% upside potential.\n\nCytokinetics Inc.\n\nCytokinetics (CYTK- Get Report) wants to use muscle activators to improve the muscle function in patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and neuromuscular diseases. While shares dipped 1% on September 20, the company has achieved 106% growth year-to-date.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It\u2019s no question that the biotech space is booming.
