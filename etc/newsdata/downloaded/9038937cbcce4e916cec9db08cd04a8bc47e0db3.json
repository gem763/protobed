However, clothing retailer Next (NXT.L) said a disappointing start to autumn trading was down to unusually warm weather in parts of Britain, rather than shoppers holding back on buying new items because of Brexit.\n\nThe Barclaycard survey showed 41% of Britons were \u201cactively pessimistic\u201d about their ability to spend on discretionary items, up five percentage points from August.\n\n\u201cWith four months of negative sales growth since March, the ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers,\u201d BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.\n\nBut Samuel Tombs, an economist with consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed the fall in September probably reflected warm weather during the month, which hit sales of winter clothing, rather than a more fundamental change.\n\n\u201cWe continue to look for only a modest slowdown in year-over-year growth in households\u2019 real spending to 1.8% in 2020, from 1.9% this year,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe BRC survey showed spending on non-food items fell as spending on essentials rose. Online sales of non-food items were the worst ever recorded.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Visitors and shoppers walk along Sheep street in the centre of Stratford-upon-Avon, Britain, March 22, 2019.

But confidence in the economy remained uncertain and one in eight consumers was stockpiling Christmas food and drink.\n\nBoth surveys had been due on Tuesday, but the BRC brought forward publication and Barclaycard followed suit.", "description": "British retailers endured their worst September since at least the mid-1990s as people spent money on entertainment instead, according to surveys that painted a muted picture of household demand ahead of Brexit.", "authors": ["Andy Bruce", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438036845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960N8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
