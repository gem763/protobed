The tumor moved toward her spine and compressed her windpipe, obstructing her breathing, Dr. Mascarenhas said.\n\nThe doctors suspected she had sarcoma, a type of cancer that can develop in various areas of the body. Michelle could not receive traditional cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nA test showed that her tumor was caused by a gene known as NTRK that had fused with another unrelated gene.\n\nAfter the test, Michelle was enrolled in a clinical trial in which she was able to try an experimental drug called larotrectinib that targeted the genetic characteristics of her tumor. Her tumor shrank within days, and Michelle was discharged from the hospital a few weeks later.\n\nThanks to precision medicine, Dr. Mascarenhas said his patient was able to recover from a life-threatening cancer.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to actually have this technology, which we can apply to our patients,\u201d the oncologist said.\n\nThat technology includes next generation gene sequencing, which can be effective in finding mutations that cause cancer and guide precision medicine to target mutations, said Jeffrey Smith, global leader for Next-Generation Sequencing Precision Medicine Initiatives for Thermo Fisher Scientific, a biotechnology product development company.\n\nWith next generation sequencing, about 4,000 gene variations can be identified in a single test, which then can be delivered to a physician to help tailor a treatment. Much of current screening depends on sequential, single-gene testing, which consumes time and body tissues, said Mr. Smith.\n\nWhile precision medicine may be more effective for treatment, it is not necessarily a viable, accessible option for everyone.\n\nJoe Germino, vice president of U.S. Medical Affairs-Oncology for Bayer, a drug and life sciences company, noted that while health insurance might pay for a targeted treatment, it might not cover genetic screening, which he said can cost between $3,000 to $5,000.\n\nHe said he hopes doctors, payers, insurance companies, regulators and patients eventually reach a consensus about precision medicine and its value in treating diseases.\n\n\u201cI hope at some point that testing of the tumor becomes as common as sending off a slice of the tumor for pathology,\u201d Mr. Germino said. \u201cBecause although right now, we have imperfect knowledge \u2014 and we will never have perfect knowledge in all probability \u2014 we\u2019ll have better knowledge and we\u2019ll have a better understanding of what drives the cancer and how to best treat it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
