Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:\n\n\u201cTo address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,\u201d the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.\n\nThe party\u2019s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.\n\nThe October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn\u2019t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It\u2019s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it\u2019s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.\n\nOn the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night \u201cdraws\u201d skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates \u2014 and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.\n\nMost excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won\u2019t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here\u2019s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:\n\nThe debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and stream on CNN.com\u2019s homepage and NYTimes.com\u2019s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN\u2019s and New York Times\u2019 apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.\n\nThis is CNN\u2019s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.\n\nUpdate, October 1: it\u2019s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate.", "description": "In a surprise decision (previously the number had been capped at ten on a single night) the DNC announced that all 12 qualifying candidates will be on the same stage at CNN\u2019s October 15 debate in Ohio, including new qualifiers Gabbard and Steyer.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/12/12-democratic-debate.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
