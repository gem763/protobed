You only have to look at how Japan has performed this tournament,\" Moore said.\n\n\"The Wallabies will take that mind-set into the game. They know they will have to play really well \u2013 as you do in a quarter final of a World Cup. Anything less than their best performance won't be good enough.\n\n\"In a way these games are sometimes easier to prepare for \u2013 there is no uncertainty about what to do. You have to go out there and play your best game, stick to your game plan, be physical and if they do that they can win the game.\"\n\nFormer Wallabies captain Stephen Moore will present jerseys to the Australian team before the game. Getty Images\n\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika, who could be coaching his last game for Australia if they bow out on Saturday, has confounded critics with some of his selections for the crucial game.\n\nHe has thrown 19-year-old Queenslander Jordan Petaia, who has only played two Tests, into the crucial outside centre position, but kept erratic Kurtley Beale at fullback.\n\nThe revolving door policy for the No.10 jersey \u2013 the player who is supposed to direct the team around the park \u2013 continues with Christian Lealiifano recalled for the knock-out game.\n\nMoore, who now works as a general manager for the North Australian Pastoral Company, said Australia needed to do something out of left-field selection-wise to keep England second-guessing on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheika, who has divided his critics and supporters alike, has a 50.7 per cent win/loss ratio for his 67 tests in charge.\n\nHe will face off against England coach and former Randwick team-mate Eddie Jones, who has also coached the Australian and Japanese national sides.\n\nIn other games, tournament favourites New Zealand take on Ireland on Saturday night, while on Sunday unfancied host nation Japan face rugby heavyweights South Africa and Wales play France for a place in the semi-finals.\n\nBookmakers believe Cheika is about to coach his final game in charge of the Wallabies. Getty\n\nDespite great crowds, the Rugby World Cup in Japan has been beset by over zealous refereeing and a spate of yellow and red cards and suspensions, as officials try to make the game safer for players. Critics say it is ruining the spectacle of the \"game they play in heaven\".\n\nBookmakers don't believe Australia has any chance of beating England, who will be playing as British parliamentarians sit to decide the UK's Brexit future. Sportsbet has England at $1.31 to win and Australia at $3.50.\n\nFormer Wallabies coach Bob Dwyer, who coached Australia to victory in the 1991 World Cup, said Cheika was not going to die wondering in Saturday's game.\n\n\"I think Petaia is a good selection. If you're good enough you play better. He does things other people can't do. I think England don't quite know how to take him,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're obviously not favourites but that's not the important thing. People forget in the last World Cup there was the opinion we wouldn't make it out of the pool stage and we made the final.\n\n\"Like a small number of nations, we seem to play well in these tournament-like environments where you have to lift yourself for certain games and play well.\"\n\nDwyer said he rated Cheika highly as a coach, saying he had helped the NSW Waratahs win a maiden Super Rugby Title in 2014 and taken Australia to a World Cup final in 2015.\n\n\"Not many coaches can say that. You'd have to say that's a success,\" he said.", "description": "Bob Dwyer and Stephen Moore say Wallabies coach Michael Cheika can go on confounding his critics - and supporters - against England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.361%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_334%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f89f03cf529ed1f523eeff09698fb86d22af403", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
