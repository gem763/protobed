If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).]\n\nA United Kingdom mother whose son was severely bullied is detailing the cruelty he faced that eventually led him to attempt suicide.\n\nTyler Hills, 46, claims her son, Caleb, 10, was bullied for roughly two years while attending the Orchard School in Canterbury, Kent. Caleb, who is of a mixed ethnic background, was largely bullied over race, Hills said.\n\nCaleb, a normally \u201clovely, bubbly [and] talkative\u201d boy, slowly became more somber over the past couple of years and expressed hesitation to go to school, his mother said.\n\nBOY, 10, KILLS HIMSELF AFTER BEING BULLIED FOR WEARING COLOSTOMY BAG: MOM\n\nLast summer, the 10-year-old, who also suffers from learning disabilities, reached a breaking point: Hills says Caleb attempted to hang himself.\n\n\u201cI found him in his bedroom. I felt sick to the pit of my stomach and helpless,\u201d she told South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018They keep calling me mean things, they\u2019re not nice to me, I keep telling the teachers but they\u2019re not listening,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nCaleb also told his mother that some of his fellow classmates called him derogatory terms, reportedly using the n-word.\n\n\u201cMy gut dropped. He asked, \u2018What does it mean?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018How dare you allow my child to be treated like that?\u2019 I\u2019ve got to sit here and explain to him what this means. He\u2019s a baby \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t have to be going through all this, not at this age.\"\n\n\"It made me angry and upset because I know what the n-word actually means,\u201d Caleb told SWNS. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to school because they harassed me all day.\u201d\n\nHills contacted the school, and the students who used the word reportedly apologized to Caleb. But not long after, the bullying resumed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to school because they harassed me all day.\" \u2014 Caleb Hills\n\nFollowing Caleb\u2019s suicide attempt, Hills withdrew her son from the school. Caleb was just one of a handful of students at the school of a mixed ethnic background, according to SWNS, citing school records.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Orchard School, Annabel Lilley, said: \u201cSchool staff, governors, the local authority and I worked extensively with Caleb\u2019s mother to try to bring about a solution that Ms. Hills would be satisfied with and that would enable him to remain here.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaleb was well-liked and was doing well and we are sorry he is no longer a part of our school community,\u201d she added.\n\nCaleb is not yet enrolled in another school. The Kent County Council, of which the Orchard School is a part of, per SWNS, has reportedly offered to pay for Caleb to attend a different school.\n\n\u201cHaving him out of school means I am looking after him 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d Hills said. \u201cI love my child dearly, but I need a break and he needs an education.\"\n\nUNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE GIVES SCHOLARSHIP TO BULLIED STUDENT WHO DESIGNED HOMEMADE SCHOOL SHIRT\n\nAccording to stopbullying.gov, an official website of the U.S. government, children who are \u201cperceived as different from their peers\u201d are more at risk for bullying.\n\n\u201cBetween one in four and one in three U.S. students say they have been bullied at school,\u201d it continues, noting most instances of bullying occurs during a child\u2019s middle school years.", "description": "A United Kingdom mother whose son was severely bullied is detailing the cruelty he faced that eventually led him to attempt suicide.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Caleb Hills", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
