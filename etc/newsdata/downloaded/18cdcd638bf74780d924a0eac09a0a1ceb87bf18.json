Injuries have made us go into this position but it's working quite well.'\n\nSolskjaer is also ready to play two up front again having started the season with a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nHe added: 'That could happen, definitely. We're looking more dangerous up front with two at the moment. I thought Marcus (Rashford) and Dan James caused Liverpool problems, so it depends on who's fit, Mason (Greenwood) could have played against Partizan as well.'\n\nIf United keep to a 3-4-1-2 formation against Norwich, Solskjaer has a number of options in the No 10 role.\n\nMarcus Rashford is likely to keep his place for Norwich and have a strike partner\n\nHe added: 'Dan can play in many positions, as can so many others. Andreas (Pereira) can play there, Juan (Mata) can play there, Jesse (Lingard) can play there. So we've got loads of players who can play behind two forwards. It's just who's fit, who's in form and what do we decide is the best against Norwich.'\n\nThe Canaries may be second from bottom in the Premier League but they shocked champions Manchester City 3-2 at Carrow Road last month.\n\nSolskjaer added: 'They beat Newcastle and Manchester City, a team with a clear philosophy on how they want to play. So, I hope we're going to stop them because it's always going to be difficult down at Carrow Road.\n\n'We're ready for it now. We've been to Belgrade, got some players back, I managed to take off Aaron (Wan-Bissaka) and Anthony (Martial) after 60 minutes because they've been out for a long time. So hopefully we'll have a fresh team because we need to be at our best to have a chance.'", "description": "Manchester United could stick with a back-three at Norwich on Sunday, admits Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
