A beautiful dog \u2013 a talented dog \u2013 was injured and brought back.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said two service members suffered minor injuries but already have returned to duty.\n\nThe U.S. forces\u2019 use of dogs was reminiscent of the Navy SEALs\u2019 use of a dog during the raid on Usama bin Laden\u2019s compound in 2011 that resulted in his death.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon have not provided details about the dogs, or the status of the one injured. Ron Aiello, a retired Marine cited by The New York Times, said the dogs likely were either German shepherds or Belgian Malinois \u2013 the breed used in the raid on bin Laden.\n\nAL-BAGHDADI TAKEDOWN CATCHES DEMS FLAT-FOOTED, BLUNTS CRITICISM OF TRUMP\u2019S SYRIA PULLBACK\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re leading the patrol, they want a dog that is not only an explosive detection dog but on command can be aggressive,\u201d Aiello said. \u201cOn a mission like this you want a dog that can be aggressive when necessary.\u201d\n\nTrump on Sunday shifted from praising the dogs in the raid to comparing al-Baghdadi to a \u201cdog.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Sunday said military dogs chased Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi down a dark underground tunnel before he detonated a suicide vest that injured one of the dogs.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
