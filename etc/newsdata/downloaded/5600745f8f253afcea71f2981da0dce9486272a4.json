Donald Trump is the first president since the 1990s to face impeachment by Congress. At best for him, it will be the dirtiest, most humiliating battle yet of a tumultuous political career. At worst, it will be the death blow to his presidency.\n\nTrump can do more damage than Nixon. His impeachment is imperative Read more\n\nIn a week for the history books, Trump was revealed to have used the powers of the Oval Office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election for his personal political interests \u2013 an abuse that the White House then tried to cover up.\n\nDemocrats moved swiftly to launch an impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that detailed how Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to help smear a political rival, the former vice-president Joe Biden. It set the stage for weeks of partisan trench warfare likely to deepen national divisions. But it also offered a sliver of hope to Trump\u2019s critics: that he could be drummed out of office by Christmas.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the House speaker, reportedly instructed congressional committees to keep a narrow focus on the Ukraine scandal rather than Trump\u2019s myriad other alleged misdemeanours and to file the results of their investigations within weeks. With aides describing a \u201cneed for speed\u201d, a vote to impeach could take place by mid-November.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen fast,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cThe House is going to have to decide which articles of impeachment to draft and send forward. My guess is obstruction of justice and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nIf the Democratic-led House votes to approve articles of impeachment, the Republican-controlled Senate will then decide whether to find Trump guilty and remove him from office. This seems far-fetched, but Kamarck said: \u201cI\u2019d give it a 30% to 40% chance. Remember how things shift and how public opinion shifts when you get these high-velocity events. There are people who\u2019ve stood up to Trump in the Senate; they\u2019re not totally terrified of him.\n\n\u201cWe forget the human part: Trump has no friends. No one likes him. When push comes to shove, he doesn\u2019t have depth and loyalty. If things get really bad and they can see a political future without him, they\u2019ll abandon him.\u201d\n\nIf there were a blind vote in the Senate, at least 30, possibly more of the Republican senators would vote to convict Michael Steele\n\nTo date, Republican senators have been cowed by Trump\u2019s fervent support base and approval rating of around 90% within the party. But the relationship could prove fragile. A former Democrat, Trump was an outsider when he in effect staged a hostile takeover in the 2016 primary and many of his views are at odds with party orthodoxy.\n\nConviction requires a two-thirds vote of the 100-member Senate: 67 votes. That means 20 Republicans would be required to rebel. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the challenge for Democrats was to win over public opinion.\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019ve got the votes to impeach. The goal here is to create a narrative in which the American people wind up convincing the Senate they must convict.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s true that if there were a blind vote in the Senate, at least 30, possibly more of the Republican senators would vote to convict the president. But they won\u2019t do it absent a very public movement in that direction. In other words, the public itself, their base.\u201d\n\nTimeline of a scandal\n\nSuch comments are a measure of the gravity of Trump\u2019s offence, different in kind from all those that went before. Unlike the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s 448-page report on the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia in the 2016 election and the president\u2019s apparent attempts to obstruct justice, the attempt to extort Ukraine involved Trump personally, while in office, and can be summarised in no more words than a single tweet.\n\nThere was an early hint of trouble in May when the New York Times reported that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, planned to travel to Ukraine to press the government to investigate not only 2016 election interference but also claims Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor looking into a gas company where his son, Hunter Biden, was a board member.\n\nMike Pompeo subpoenaed to turn over Trump-Ukraine documents Read more\n\nGiuliani cancelled the trip, claiming the newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was \u201csurrounded by enemies\u201d of Trump. In June, Giuliani wrote on Twitter that Zelenskiy was \u201cstill silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 and alleged Biden bribery\u201d.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos he would consider receiving information on an election rival from a foreign source.\n\n\u201cI think you might want to listen, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] \u2018We have information on your opponent\u2019 \u2013 oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d\n\nThe following month, the president issued instructions to freeze nearly $400m approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. On 24 July, Mueller testified to Congress but was widely seen as rambling and vague, failing to provide a smoking gun for impeachment.\n\nA day later came Trump\u2019s fateful phone call with Zelenskiy. After discussing military aid, he asked for a \u201cfavour\u201d then later pressed the Ukrainian president to speak to Giuliani and the attorney general, William Barr, about reopening a Ukrainian investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nOn 12 August, an intelligence community whistleblower filed a complaint. Another month passed. On 18 September, the Washington Post published the first details of the whistleblower complaint. It was very soon and very clearly a game changer.\n\nThis week, as political pressure built, the White House a released a rough transcript of Trump-Zelenskiy call. It showed the US president did indeed push his counterpart to dig up dirt on Biden. Critics called it extortion and \u201ca classic mafia-like shakedown\u201d. Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry, citing the president\u2019s \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Volodymyr Zelenskiy listens during a bilateral meeting with Donald Trump in New York. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump and Zelenskiy met in person for the first time on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly in New York. The Ukrainian leader, a political novice and former comedian, told reporters it was a \u201cnormal\u201d call, insisting: \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nBut on Thursday the House intelligence committee released an unclassified version of the whistleblower complaint. The nine-page document said: \u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nIt also alleged an attempt to conceal the offence, stating that White House officials took extraordinary steps to \u201clock down\u201d information about the call, even moving the transcript to a secret computer system.\n\n\u2018He loves fights\u2019\n\nThe Zelinskiy phone call, and Trump\u2019s willingness to make it public, renewed questions over his ability to distinguish right from wrong or understand the rule of law. Reaching for his familiar playbook, he made no apology and showed no contrition, but rather fired off a fusillade of tweets and retweets accusing Democrats of another witch-hunt.\n\nAnd he jettisoned all norms in expressing special rage towards the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information, because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said to staff from the US mission to the UN. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nHe loves fights. That\u2019s his comfort zone. He likes people being angry and yelling at each other Gwenda Blair\n\nGwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think right or wrong are categories he thinks in. The only category is, can he get away with it?\u201d\n\nTrump will be ready for the impeachment battle to come, Blair said. \u201cHe loves fights. That\u2019s his comfort zone. He likes people being angry and yelling at each other. He gins that up any chance he gets. He did it at Trump Tower when he was running a real estate business.\n\n\u201cThat combative atmosphere is what he thrives on. He\u2019s comfortable when everyone else is uncomfortable, running and ducking for cover. That\u2019s how he got elected, pitting people against each other. He\u2019s into \u2018bring it on\u2019 because he\u2019s in his element.\u201d\n\nThe Republican and conservative media machines have cranked into gear. Giuliani has given a series of weird and wild interviews, insisting that he, not the whistleblower, was the true \u201chero\u201d of the hour. Fox News hosts such as Sean Hannity expressed outrage at \u201cpsychotic anti-Trump hysteria\u201d and demanded that Biden be investigated. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nBut Democrats who had long agonised over whether to exercise the ultimate sanction against a wayward president suddenly found bracing, galvanising clarity. Opinion polls show growing support for impeachment and Pelosi\u2019s move has come as a relief to activists who felt that, having survived the Mueller report and countless other incidents unscathed, Trump felt unleashed and able to act with ever greater impunity.\n\nTom Steyer, founder of the Need to Impeach campaign and a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that every time that Mr Trump got away with something it emboldened him to go further. I said from the beginning: it\u2019s only gonna get worse if we don\u2019t hold him to account.\u201d\n\nTrump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal Read more\n\n\u201cBefore this ever came to light about this specific incident, over half of the Democrats in Congress had already come out publicly for impeachment. The percentage of Democratic voters who are for impeachment has always been high. So this is really the triumph of the grassroots and the will of the American people building over years and demanding hold the president to account and do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nTrump is set to join a select group in the presidential hall of shame. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been impeached, although both were acquitted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned under the threat of impeachment.\n\nSteyer, an entrepreneur, shares the view that Trump may be vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIf the American people hear the evidence and decide, \u2018He\u2019s a liar and a cheat, if I did this I\u2019d be in jail,\u2019 then I think all of the senators, including the Republican senators, are going to have to look in the mirror and decide: can they really go against what\u2019s right, go against the constitution and go against the American people?\u201d", "description": "The effort to impeach Trump is poised to move quickly, with a conviction not out of the question: \u2018No one likes him\u2019", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8a340e3c56f10c4c0942c91776c0c8699ff4c0/0_247_6409_3846/master/6409.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=275b443a37a67c7f343a36cf7062268f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
