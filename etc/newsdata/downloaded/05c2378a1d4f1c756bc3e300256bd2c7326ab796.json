The pair hooked up on scoring strikes 29, 35, 5 and 29 yards.\n\nIt was the fourth time McDonald went over 400 passing yards in a game and Ward\u2019s fourth game eclipsing 100 receiving yards. Ward tied the school record for touchdown receptions in a game.\n\nOregon State had a chance to tie with 1:25 left, but Jordan Choukair\u2019s 52-yard field goal missed wide left. The Beavers eventually got the ball back with four seconds left, but could only get to the Hawaii 45.\n\nJermar Jefferson carried 31 times for 183 yards and a touchdown and Artavis Pierce added 79 yards and two scores on seven rushes for Oregon State (0-2). Isaiah Hodgins added seven receptions for 96 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOregon State: The Beavers saw their string of four consecutive wins over Hawaii that dated to 2006 come to an end. It is their first loss to the Rainbow Warriors since the 1999 Oahu Bowl, when head coach Jonathan Smith was the team\u2019s starting quarter. Oregon State leads the all-time series 7-4.\n\nHawaii: The Rainbow Warriors have now beaten two Power 5 teams in the same season for the first time since 2006, when they beat Purdue and Arizona State. They are now 32-61 all-time against current members of the Pac-12. Their last eight wins against a Power 5 team have come against a Pac-12 opponent. It is Hawaii\u2019s third straight season with a 2-0 start, which was last achieved from 1980-\u201882.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nOregon State: Hosts Cal Poly on Sept. 14 in the first meeting between the teams. The Beavers will play three of their next four games at home.\n\nHawaii: Visits No. 14 Washington on Sept. 14 in its only non-conference road game of the season. The Rainbow Warriors are 2-3 all-time against the Huskies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "JoJo Ward had four touchdown receptions, Ryan Meskell kicked a 28-yard field goal late, and Hawaii escaped with a 31-28 win Oregon State on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/oregon_st_hawaii_football_17436_c0-140-3366-2102_s1770x1032.jpg?d1ffbf7f631dd3916771574cf4040d373a1afbed", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
