MCAS has been implicated in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents, which killed 346 people.\n\n\"The MCAS design was based on data, architecture, and assumptions that were reused from a previous aircraft configuration without sufficient detailed aircraft-level evaluation of the appropriateness of such reuse, and without additional safety margins and features,'' the report says.\n\nAnother key finding: Changes to the MCAS during the lengthy certification process were not sufficiently updated or reviewed, and any possible impacts the changes would have on flight crews were not identified. Boeing has been sharply criticized for not including the MCAS information in initial training manuals for the plane.\n\nThe report was also critical of the amount of freedom the FAA gave to Boeing's designated certification representative during the certification process, saying it \"delegated a high percentage of approvals and findings of compliance'' to the representative. It notes that delegating authority to a company representative is common during certification but emphasized that the FAA's \"Organization Designation Authorization'' program needs strong oversight.\n\n\"In the B737 MAX program, the FAA had inadequate awareness of the MCAS function which, coupled with limited involvement, resulted in an inability of the FAA to provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of the Boeing proposed certification activities associated with MCAS,'' the report says.\n\nIt also singles out reports of \"undue pressure\" on Boeing employees performing the certification activities and says that \"further erodes the level of assurance in this system of delegation.''\n\nAmong the recommendations in the report:\n\nThe safety panel recommends the FAA institute a \"top-down approach whereby every (aircraft) change is evaluated from an integrated whole aircraft system perspective.''\n\nThe FAA should \"promote a safety culture that drives a primary focus on the creation of safe products, which in turn comply with certification requirements. Aircraft functions should be assessed, not in an incremental and fragmented manner, but holistically at the aircraft level. System function and performance, including the effects of failures, should be demonstrated and associated assumptions should be challenged to ensure robust designs are realized.''\n\nThe FAA should require a \"documented process\" to determine what information will be included in the airplane's flight manual, fight crew operating manual and flight crew training manual.\n\nThe FAA should review its policies in the wake of fatal accidents, ensuring that any corrective action needed is taken and that updated safety information is shared with the worldwide aviation community.\n\nThe Max, Boeing's best-selling plane, has been grounded by the FAA since March 13 due to the accidents.\n\nThe FAA established the international panel on April 2. The team, headed by former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart and including representatives from aviation authorities around the world, was asked to take a comprehensive look at the FAA\u2019s certification of the aircraft\u2019s automated flight control system that has been linked to the crashes.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters Friday, Hart emphasized the overall safety of the U.S. aviation system under the FAA and said the panel did not find examples of deliberate wrongdoing or noncompliance with existing policies.\n\n\"We did not see that anybody intentionally did anything wrong,'' he said.\n\nHe said the FAA certification process is in need of significant updates to reflect, among other things, the complex, inter-related systems in airplanes today.\n\n\"The good news is there's more automation. The bad news is there is more automation,'' he said.\n\nThe FAA has to work in concert with plane manufacturers like Boeing during the certification process, he said, because it can't attract the technology talent needed to evaluate the systems.\n\n\"We can't hire and retain the people that we need. Most of them belong to the manufacturer,'' he said. \"That's a new reality that we're going to have to face.''\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement that he will review every recommendation and \"take appropriate action.\" He thanked the panel for its \"unvarnished and independent review'' of the certification of the Max.\n\n\"Today\u2019s unprecedented U.S. safety record was built on the willingness of aviation professionals to embrace hard lessons and to seek continuous improvement,'' the statement said. \"We welcome this scrutiny and are confident that our openness to these efforts will further bolster aviation safety worldwide. The accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia are a somber reminder that the FAA and our international regulatory partners must strive to constantly strengthen aviation safety.\"", "description": "The report from the Joint Authorities Technical Review criticized the certification process for the plane as being too narrow, among other things.", "authors": ["Dawn Gilbertson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JLujzfvuNKsCT2JwSEnMTg--~B/aD00NTA7dz0zNjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/681c1449-4ba1-4d4e-84b1-f5356ca5f779/59152d57-3ed9-5a61-b63d-34c8d76a1d1f/data_3_0.jpg?s=2a3648723253e5a20220bf69eee460ab&c=9ac4c38766a1e5d5a58309b9e5ee1f84&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
