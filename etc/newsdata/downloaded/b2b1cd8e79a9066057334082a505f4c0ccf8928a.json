Both outcomes suggest that the big winners this year are likely to come under further pressure.\"\n\nSimilarly, charts drawn up by strategists at brokerage Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research suggest that a rotation from \"momentum\" stocks--many of which are tech stocks--into value stocks this extreme is usually sustained for a year or more.\n\nAmazon.com has adjusted its product-search system to more prominently feature listings that are more profitable for the company, said people who worked on the project--a move, contested internally, that could favor Amazon's own brands.\n\nShares of New Relic plunged after the \"cloud\" software company cut its revenue projection for the year and said two top executives are departing.\n\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 16, 2019 17:35 ET (21:35 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
