The government has gone to the Supreme Court to appeal against the judgement of Scotland's highest court - the Court of Session - which last week found in favour of a group of parliamentarians who had argued that the move was unlawful. The judges will also consider an appeal by the entrepreneur Gina Miller, who unsuccessfully brought a similar case at the High Court in London.\n\nAsked whether he would recall Parliament if the government lost at the Supreme Court, the prime minister told the BBC he would \"wait and see what the judges say\".\n\nOur legal affairs correspondent says the Supreme Court will first have to decide whether the issue is a matter for the courts. If the 11 justices decide it is, their next judgement will be whether Mr Johnson's motive in advising the Queen to suspend Parliament was to undermine MPs' ability to legislate and respond to events as the country prepares to leave the EU. Our correspondent says their judgement on that will determine whether MPs and peers return to Westminster.\n\nTo know more about the decisions facing the Supreme Court - click here.\n\nStudents 'failed' over sexual harassment\n\nAn investigation by BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme has discovered there were more than 700 reported cases of sexual misconduct at British universities in the past academic year. The data - which came from Freedom of Information requests - shows there were 110 complaints of sexual assault and 80 allegations of rape. Victims have accused the universities of failing them, because some do not have adequate systems to record offences and protect complainants.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nUS TV stalwart drops comedian over slurs\n\nSaturday Night Live - one of the best-known TV shows in the US - has fired new cast member Shane Gillis one week after he was hired after it emerged he had mocked Chinese people and made homophobic remarks in a 2018 podcast. While Gillis defended the comments on Twitter saying he is a comedian \"who pushes boundaries\", SNL said \"the language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable\". The row has overshadowed the start of the 45th season of the comedy sketch show, which has featured such names as Bill Murray, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next?\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\n\"As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage.

The Guardian describes PM Boris Johnson's decision not to attend a joint press conference with Xavier Bettel as a \"humiliation\". But the Daily Express accuses Mr Bettel of trying to \"upstage\" his guest and the Daily Telegraph says Mr Johnson walked into an \"EU ambush\". Elsewhere, the Daily Mirror reports that Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has told the BBC he wants to see his \u00a31.75m salary cut, while the Sun reports on the \"secret family tragedy\" which \"haunts\" England cricketer Ben Stokes.
