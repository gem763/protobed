Here's how it works.\n\nThe news of a man falling during a Seattle mountain bike ride and miraculously surviving broke around the world in September 2019. Images indicated he had gotten some nasty head injuries, but it was how he survived that made the story so interesting.\n\nWhile the man was unconscious, his Apple Watch Series 4 had alerted his son the man had taken a 'hard fall' and provided the location where it was detected. But by the time his son had arrived to check on him, the man had already been taken to hospital because the watch had called emergency services.\n\nAn Apple Watch had likely saved his life.\n\nWhy Apple Watch Series 5 Won't Get The Heart Testing Feature in Australia The Apple Watch Series 5 was announced at Apple's big iPhone launch in mid-September with new features including always on display, international emergency calling and a new compass \u2013 and it was confirmed the heart-monitoring app, ECG, from the Apple Watch Series 4 would appear again in the upcoming model. But if you buy an Apple Watch Series 5 here, the heart-monitoring app is not available \u2013 and won't be in the near future. Read more\n\nSo, how does it work?\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 can detect when you take a hard fall. Using the device's accelerometer and gyroscope technology, a 'hard' fall is determined on the basis of wrist trajectory and impact acceleration.\n\nOnce that happens, it will alert you by buzzing, sounding an alarm, and displaying an on-screen alert for one minute. After that minute's up and you haven't moved though, another 30-second countdown will begin, while the watch continues to alert you, and then it will proceed to call emergency services.\n\nThe watch plays an audio message to emergency services, giving them your latitude and longitude coordinates, which continues until emergency services end the call or the fallen user responds to let them know any further information.\n\nIf you've set up an emergency contact, it'll also let them know what's happened and where you are.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nIf you're actually fine or you're just doing your rigorous workout regime, you can dismiss the alert before any calls are made by tapping \"I'm OK.\"\n\nBut Apple admits on its site it's not always accurate. \"The more physically active you are, the more likely you are to trigger fall detection due to high impact activity that can appear to be a fall,\" Apple said.\n\nStill, many would probably argue life-saving fall detection by the watch will always outweigh the minor inconvenience of switching off a false detection.\n\nWhat if I have a WiFi model?\n\nIf your model doesn't have cellular capability, it can't call anyone without Wi-Fi. It's still possible for the feature to be used with a non-cellular model but it'll need to be near your iPhone or within a known Wi-Fi connection. You'll also need to have Wi-Fi Calling switched on.\n\nHead to Settings, then Phone and select Wi-Fi Calling. This means your watch can now be used to call using a Wi-Fi network.\n\nWhat if I'm overseas?\n\nThe feature will still work if you're overseas if you have a Series 5. It'll automatically call the local emergency service if you take a hard fall but unlike domestic fall detection, it won't send emergency service your location or notify your emergency contacts. If your device isn't a cellular model, you'll need to have your iPhone nearby.\n\nThe feature is not available while in the following countries:\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBrazil\n\nColombia\n\nDominican Republic\n\nGhana\n\nGuatemala\n\nIraq\n\nJapan\n\nMexico\n\nNamibia\n\nPalestine\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nSouth Africa\n\nTunisia\n\nGizmodo Australia has contacted to Apple to clarify whether the audio message would play in the primary language of the country in case where English isn't commonly spoken.\n\nHas it saved anyone's life yet?\n\nAside from the recent story coming out of the U.S., Apple Watch's fall detection feature has been attributed for getting a few people out of bad situations.\n\nIn July 2019, a Sydney mother, suffering from epilepsy, had a sudden collapse within her home while, according to news.com.au. She at home by herself but the Apple Watch she was wearing alerted emergency service and an ambulance was sent out to the residence.\n\nHer husband was also notified of her hard fall and her location as she was taken from their home to the hospital where she was held for four days. Without the fall detection feature, the mother might've had to wait hours until someone returned home to realise what had transpired.\n\nHow do I turn this feature on?\n\nWhile the feature is incredibly useful for people of all ages, it's switched off by default for users under the age of 65.\n\nTo fix that ASAP, head to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and click on the My Watch tab. Once there, search for Emergency SOS and slide Fall Detection on.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nCan I put my mum down as an emergency contact?\n\nYes, and to do that, you'll have to head to the Health app. Once there, choose Medical ID and hit that Edit button. Scroll to Emergency Contacts and add them in, similar to adding in a regular phone contact.", "description": "The Apple Watch Series 5 is now out and while it's not a major upgrade to the Series 4, it has gotten some cool new features such as an always-on display, call blocking and period tracking.
