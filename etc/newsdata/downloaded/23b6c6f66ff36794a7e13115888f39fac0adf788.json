The pan-European STOXX 600 was down\n\n0.13% by 0800 GMT. .EU\n\nStocks globally took a battering last week, falling to their\n\nlowest level in over a month on fears of a U.S. economic\n\nslowdown. But positive U.S. jobs data on Friday helped spark a\n\nturnaround.\n\n\"I think the fact that the U.S. jobs report was broadly\n\npositive really put the brakes on the fear factor that was\n\ncirculating last week - that the U.S. has been hit hard by the\n\ntrade war,\" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in\n\nLondon.\n\nAsian stocks rallied in the slipstream of gains on Wall\n\nStreet, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific Shares\n\noutside Japan rising 0.1%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei stock index opened higher but\n\nreversed course and fell 0.2%. A key Japanese economic index\n\nfell in August and the government downgraded its outlook for the\n\neconomy to \"worsening\", suggesting export-reliant Japan could\n\nslip into recession. MSCI's All-Country World Index , which tracks\n\nshares across 47 markets, flitted between positive and negative\n\nterritory for most of trade in London. It was last flat.\n\nGermany's DAX declined 0.2% after the data showed\n\nindustrial orders fell slightly more than expected in August.\n\nMorale among investors in the euro zone dropped in October\n\nto its lowest level in more than six years as stimulus measures\n\ntaken by central banks failed to allay recession fears, a survey\n\nby the Sentix research group showed. Besides the steady trickle of weak economic data, investors\n\nalso had their eyes on U.S.-China trade talks. Bloomberg\n\nreported that Chinese officials are signalling they are\n\nincreasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump. The report briefly lifted the safe-haven Japanese yen and\n\ngold.\n\nAn impeachment drive by U.S. Democrats over a\n\nwhistleblower's allegations that Trump leveraged $400 million in\n\naid to secure a promise from Ukraine's President to investigate\n\npolitical rival Joe Biden will continue this week. Several U.S.\n\ndiplomats will head to Capitol Hill for closed-door testimonies.\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come\n\nforward to substantiate the first complaint from an unnamed U.S.\n\ngovernment official, which touched off the investigation.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say the second whistleblower coming\n\nforward will be an issue for Trump. This strengthens China's\n\nbargaining position in the trade war,\" Madden said.\n\nU.S. stock futures were 0.5% lower. .N\n\nIn currencies, the dollar was 0.1% higher against a basket\n\nof peers. The euro was 0.1% lower at $1.0967 EUR=EBS . Sterling\n\nfell as investors fear Britain and the European Union are no\n\ncloser to agreeing a Brexit withdrawal deal. GBP/\n\nEuro zone government bond yields were little changed as\n\ninvestors weighed the prospects of a resilient economy in the\n\nUnited States against concern that U.S.-Sino trade negotiations\n\nwould fail. GVD/EUR\n\nYields in the euro area traded broadly neutral, with the\n\nGerman 10-year Bund yield falling 0.4 basis points to -0.59%\n\n.\n\nPortuguese bonds were also supported by news on Friday that\n\nDBRS has upgraded Portugal's credit rating. Oil prices rose. Brent crude futures were higher by 0.2% at\n\n$58.51 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude\n\nwere 0.5% higher at $53.06.\n\nSpot gold , fell 0.14% to $1,502.30 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks hover as weak European data, trade anxiety offsets U.S. jobs boost", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
