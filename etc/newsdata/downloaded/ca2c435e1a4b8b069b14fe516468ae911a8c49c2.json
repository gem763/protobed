These are the key methods people have found, alony with how much some people have claimed back:\n\nBank account reclaims - \u00a34,500 back\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBanks offer current accounts free, but they also have paid-for services with a host of added extras.\n\nBut a lot of people who signed up to these pay-for accounts already had the services being offered to them again as part of the \"deal\".\n\nAnd if the salesman didn't check first to make sure you could use all the things on offer, that means you could be entitled get the money you paid them back.\n\nStephen emailed Martin to say thanks for the tip off. \"After reading your reclaim packaged bank accounts article I did what you said and 3 days later had \u00a34,500 credited to my account,\" he wrote.\n\nAn added PPI bonus - \u00a3300 back\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAnyone with a PPI claim might also have a claim for more money back - this time from the taxman.\n\nThat's because the payout is technically just returning money you've already been taxed on once, so any extra tax applied might well be wiped. And it could mean hundreds more for you.\n\nGeoff tweeted Martin to tell of his success in this field.\n\n\"Thanks for your advice on claiming a tax refund that was deducted from my PPI claim. Just received \u00a3300 from joint claim. Didn't know HMRC could act so fast,\" he tweeted.\n\nMarriage couples and civil partners - \u00a3902 back\n\n(Image: Blend Images)\n\nThere's a tax break available for people who are married or in civil partnerships that could be worth \u00a3900 if you've not claimed it before.\n\nIt applies to couples where one partner earns less than \u00a312,500 and the other between \u00a312,500 and \u00a350,000.\n\nThe better news is that if you've not claimed it before, you can get four years' worth back and it only takes 10 minutes to apply.\n\nA reader named John emailed Martin to say how much he'd claimed.\n\n\"After reading your marriage tax allowance article I realised a simple task had not been done. My wife applied online that day. Amazement, received a cheque issued the next day for \u00a3902.\n\n\"Thank you, and thanks HMRC for a 24hr response.\"\n\nPayday loans - \u00a32,400 back\n\nPayday loans companies were sometimes lax when assessing how easily people could afford to pay them back.\n\nThat means - even if you successfully paid off the loan - you could be in line for compensation if the firm didn't check properly before lending to you.\n\nTake Ricky, for one.\n\n\"I filed some reports for 'irresponsible lending' following advice from you guys and have managed to get \u00a32,400 back. Incredible, thanks so much for what you all do,\" he tweeted to Martin.\n\nStudent loan overpayments - \u00a3200 back\n\nThe way people pay back student loans is a weird partnership between the taxman and the student loans company.\n\nAs a result an awful lot of people started seeing money pulled from their pay cheques before it should have been - and that's before we get to the fun that happens if you're ever lucky enough to clear one.\n\nThe good news is that if you started paying too soon, or kept paying too long, you can reclaim the cash.\n\nClair emailed Martin telling him of her success.\n\n\"Thanks for your student loan reclaiming article. My boyfriend and I received nearly \u00a3200 each for a 5-min phone call,\" she told Martin.\n\nCouncil tax - \u00a37,000 back\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf you - or someone you live with - has a disability, a health condition or are a carer, you could be overpaying on council tax without even knowing it.\n\nThere's a 25% discount if you live with someone with a severe mental impairment and no other adults, or only adults who are also disregarded for council tax purposes or a 100% discount - if you have a severe mental impairment and live alone.\n\nThe better news is claims are back-dated - meaning you could get huge amounts back.\n\nTake Catherine. She emailed Martin explaining just how much she had returned.\n\n\"Thank you for highlighting the council tax refund for those with dementia. I've just applied on behalf of my mother and over \u00a37,000 is being refunded,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Nobody from any agency had ever mentioned this, so I am very happy to have read your emails.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAnd these aren't the only places yoy can get money back you're owed.\n\nMartin is now urging everyone to check to sse how much they can get too.\n\n\"Now I've the proof of the pudding, I'm again urging you to check my 13 ways you may be owed \u00a31,000s back. All of these can be DIYed - there's no need to pay anyone,\" he said.\n\n\"So scan through it and see if you're due.
