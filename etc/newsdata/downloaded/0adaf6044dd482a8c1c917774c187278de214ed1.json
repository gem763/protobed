Several Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind the idea.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., endorsed the approach Monday in a CNN town hall-style event, saying her aim would be to eliminate all private insurance.\n\n\"Who of us has not had that situation, where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, well, 'I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this,' \" Harris said. \"Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on.\"\n\nHarris was a co-sponsor of a 2017 bill written by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would have created a national, single-payer health system, eliminating the private insurance system.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., both presidential hopefuls, also co-sponsored the Sanders bill.\n\nEveryone would get a Medicare card and doctors would have to sign annual agreements to participate.\n\nThe major questions the candidates face is how the government would pay for it.\n\nTotal spending on health care in the U.S. was about $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is forecast to rise to $5.7 trillion in 2026, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe federal government already pays for a lot of that through Medicare, Medicaid, military health care and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Much of the rest is through employer health insurance plans and individual health insurance and payments by patients.\n\nSanders laid out several options to pay for his proposal, including increasing taxes on employers who would no longer be paying insurance premiums; increasing individual income taxes; and boosting taxes on the wealthy.\n\nHarris didn't say, in the town hall-style meeting, how she would pay for the program. And her Senate office didn't respond to an email asking whether she has a funding proposal.\n\nWarren has proposed a 2 percent tax on the wealth of an individual that's above $50 million and 3 percent on wealth of more than $1 billion.\n\nThe mechanism for paying for \"Medicare-for-all\" can make the politics muddy.\n\nA recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that 56 percent of people in the U.S. like the idea overall.\n\nBut when people heard more details, those numbers changed.\n\nWhen the question included the idea that \"Medicare-for-all\" would guarantee health insurance as a right, its support rose to 71 percent. But when it said people would have to pay more taxes, the popularity plummeted to 37 percent.\n\nThat dynamic has created an opening for potential centrist candidates to stake out a middle road.\n\nHoward Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, who has said he is considering a presidential run, told CBS reporters that Harris' proposal to eliminate the health insurance industry is \"not American.\" He also called proposed tax increases on the wealthy \"punitive.\"\n\nMike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and founder of Bloomberg LP, who is also considering a run, said in New Hampshire Tuesday that he, too, opposed the idea.\n\n\"To replace the entire private system where companies provide health care for their employees would bankrupt us for a very long time,\" he told workers at a factory he was visiting.\n\nBloomberg has said he supports opening Medicare to people who don't have coverage through their employers.\n\nThe health insurance industry is already gearing up to oppose any \"Medicare-for-all\" proposals, according to The Intercept, an investigative news website.", "description": "The idea, they say, would be to eliminate the health insurance industry and replace it with government-run health insurance.
