And there the issues still favor Mr. Trump. Ms. Warren\u2019s government monopoly on health care is a tough sell. She was right to say that she has never met anyone who loves their health insurance company, but not many people who have health insurance want to get rid of it. Gun control is very popular with the Democratic base, but much less so in western Pennsylvania and rural Michigan and Wisconsin, where this election may be decided. Likewise with the Green New Deal, reparations and the whole progressive social justice agenda.\n\nIf Mr. Biden falters, though \u2014 and maybe even if he doesn\u2019t \u2014 Ms. Warren is a strong, viable candidate who, in some ways, might be more effective against Mr. Trump simply because she can articulate the challenges of the middle and working classes that are the source of his political power. She was at her strongest when she was telling her own life story. She came from modest means and went to the University of Houston for $50 per semester as a nonresident. It\u2019s $13,000 to $15,000 for nonresidents now. Then she went to law school while her aunt helped care for her two small children. She got ahead in the way that many Americans want their children to get ahead but see as less and less possible.\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful narrative because it describes an America with a large, self-confident, self-sustaining middle class. Today, much of that is gone, and what\u2019s left is under pressure. This is the same sense of decline that Mr. Trump tapped into. It\u2019s powerful because it\u2019s real. This is where the narrative of blue-collar, lunch-bucket Joe Biden feels less authentic and less relevant than Elizabeth Warren, the special ed teacher turned law professor.\n\nWhen it came to the other candidates, I couldn\u2019t shake the sense that they were role-playing the version of themselves they had read about in a friendly profile of their campaign or that came in a briefing book. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro both played their parts perfectly, genuflecting to the gods of multiculturalism by speaking Spanish during the debate. Andrew Yang told us, \u201cI am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors\u201d and pushed a $12,000-per-year sweepstakes for 10 lucky families because he\u2019s the rich novelty candidate from Silicon Valley. The only thing that would have been more in character is if he had said the payments would be made in Bitcoin.\n\nAmong the other candidates, Cory Booker wound us up with another anecdote about some person he met as soon as he moved to Newark, while Pete Buttigieg tried to maintain the imperial, aloof self-confidence of the Rhodes scholar who became the mayor of a small Midwestern city and defies stereotypes. It all seemed too packaged, too planned, too in character. Slick, consultant-driven, focus-group-tested, too-perfect candidates seem less believable these days when the best candidates let loose on social media and connect directly with voters.\n\nBut the question on which all of this turns remains the same: How do these candidates and these issues play in the handful of states that will decide the election? Arizona and other Democratic dream states probably remain out of reach. But in the upper Midwest the election will again turn on issues of economic security and American identity. Rust Belt voters have seen their communities decimated first by deindustrialization and the exportation of their jobs and are now dealing with the fallout in the form of opiate addiction, alcohol abuse and increased suicide rates.\n\nThey are looking for a president with a plan not just to alleviate their immediate economic need with a handout, but to rebuild the country\u2019s economy in a way that encourages the growth and security of the middle class and restores a sense of confidence in the American nation. Elizabeth Warren is interesting because she correctly identifies many of the challenges facing the broad middle class, but this is still ground that favors Mr. Trump if he returns to the issues that worked in 2016.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
