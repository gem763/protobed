( CDNS ) .\n\nHis response? \"No, let's hold off. This stock is overvalued,\" said Cramer. Let's check the charts and indicators.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of CDNS, below, we can see that the stock has run up from around $40 to briefly break above $75 in July.\n\nThe pattern since May looks like we are seeing prices \"roll over\" with CDNS now trading below the declining 50-day moving average line. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved with the price action and weakened from July into September suggesting a shift from aggressive buying to aggressive selling. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator shows lower highs from March to July even though prices made higher highs. This bearish divergence could play out with weaker prices in the weeks ahead.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of CDNS, below, we can see that prices have tripled over the past three years. CDNS is above the rising 40-week moving average line, which is a positive, but lagging indicator. The weekly OBV line has been flat for a number of months, which is a bearish divergence when compared to the price action. The MACD oscillator is in a take-profits sell signal above the zero-line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of CDNS, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $58 projected.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts of CDNS look vulnerable to a decline to the $58 area.", "description": "The charts of CDNS look vulnerable to a decline to the $58 area....CDNS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Cadence Design Systems Could Change Its Tone In The Weeks Ahead", "The Charts Of Cdns Look Vulnerable To A Decline To The", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Kevin Curran", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9c0a6f37-ff9c-11e7-a14a-0d9736176874.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
