They would add to a spike in departures already this year among Goldman\u2019s partners, whose title has inspired envy across Wall Street for decades but lost some of its luster in recent years.\n\nElisha Wiesel, Goldman\u2019s chief technology executive, and Steven Strongin, who runs the firm\u2019s research operation, are among those who are discussing stepping down, according to people familiar with the matter. A senior partner in stock trading, Jeff Nedelman, quit on Wednesday, other people familiar with the matter said. Martin Chavez, who was co-head of Goldman\u2019s trading division and, before that, its chief financial officer, announced his retirement on Tuesday, saying, \u201cthe last thing I want to do is be in anyone\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nIn all, up to 15% of Goldman\u2019s partners may leave this year, far higher than typical turnover. Fewer are rising to take their place: Goldman last year named 69 new partners, its smallest partner class in two decades. Chief Executive David Solomon, who took over last fall, is in some cases deliberately culling a partnership he sees as bloated, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears in WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\n\u2018Father is surgeon,\u2019 \u20181 mil pledge\u2019: The role of money in USC admissions.\n\nAn all-American pickup fight is revving up.", "description": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s partnership is shrinking under a new chief executive who wants to restore its exclusivity.", "authors": ["Liz Hoffman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB534_goldma_ZG_20190108094623.jpg"}
