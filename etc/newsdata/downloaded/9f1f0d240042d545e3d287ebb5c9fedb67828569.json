AMTD, -25.76% led the decliners, sliding 23% in early afternoon trade. E-Trade Financial Corp. ETFC, -16.43% was down 16.3% and Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, -9.41% was down 9%. Charles Schwab SCHW, -9.73% itself was down 9.1%.\n\nSchwab said the decision to remove \u201cthe final pricing barrier to investing online\u201d comes with the publication of founder Charles Schwab\u2019s new book, \u201cInvested.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom day one, my passion has been to make investing easier and more affordable for everyone,\u201d Schwab said, according to a statement.\n\nSchwab currently charges clients $4.95 per stock, ETF or option trade. The new service comes with no minimum account size. The trading of options will continue to be subject to a fee of 65 cents per contract.\n\nJMP analyst Devin Ryan said the Schwab news comes as the market enters a new commission price war as \u201cfree trading\u201d has shifted from aberration toward norm. Just last week, Interactive Brokers said it would begin offering unlimited commission-free trading as part of a \u201clite\u201d model that would be separate from the rest of its platform.\n\nRead also: As Schwab slashes commissions, can it get any cheaper to be an investor?\n\n\u201cGiven that Schwab has been evolving its business model away from a reliance on commissions (toward market based revenues and interest rate sensitive earnings, another topic given potential headwinds), the anticipated impact from these actions (cited by the company) is just a 3-4% decline in revenue (or $360-$400M, which equates to $0.20-$0.23 per share before assuming any expense offsets, or 8% of our 2019E EPS),\u201d the analyst wrote in a note to clients.\n\nSee now: Data show October\u2019s reputation for stock-market volatility is well deserved\n\nThe move was inevitable for Schwab given its focus on price, as it did not want to be left in the minority in charging its customers to trade. A question remains for competitors such as Ameritrade and E-Trade, said Jefferies analysts Daniel Fannon and Gerald O\u2019Hara.\n\n\u201cBoth TD Ameritrade and ETrade will be forced to react to this (as will others, such as Fidelity, which generate a greater portion of annual revenue from commissions),\u201d they wrote in a note to clients.\n\nRead also: Value investing isn\u2019t back \u2014 but economic growth is\n\nAs commission pricing concerns have been around for a while as an overhang for the stocks, some of the pain should be priced in, said JMP\u2019s Ryan. But even if it does create greater uncertainty for the group, it remains attractive, especially E-Trade, which is trading at about 10 times current earnings.\n\n\u201cWe also think that E*TRADE has more of an ability to control its own destiny as a seller, and the escalation of commission pressure could be a catalyst to determine that combining with another firm would drive the best outcome for shareholders,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nRead now: StockTwits to launch commission-free stock trading platform to rival Robinhood, others\n\nRyan added that he expects more announcements from companies in the industry in the coming weeks.\n\nJefferies analysts are expecting the move to drive consolidation in the sector. \u201cThe long-speculated potential for M&A among the group only intensifies as scale becomes increasingly important,\u201d they wrote in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, Robinhood, an investing app that is popular with millennials, said the changes in the industry merely reflect a customer focus that it has embraced since its beginning.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: There\u2019s a loud corner of Reddit where millennials look to get rich or die tryin\u2019\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on offering intuitively designed products that reduce barriers to our financial system, including account minimums and commission fees,\u201d spokesperson Jack Randall wrote in emailed comments.\n\nSchwab shares have fallen 8% in 2019, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.23% has gained 18% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.28% has risen 14%.\n\nRead now: What\u2019s your \u2018wealth number\u2019?
