DPRK is short for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n'Refrain from provocations'\n\nThe test \"had no adverse impact on the security of neighbouring countries\", KCNA said but gave no further details.\n\nPhotos released in the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a black-and-white painted missile emerging and clearing the surface of the water, then the booster rocket igniting to propel it into the sky.\n\nA US State Department spokesperson called on Pyongyang to \"refrain from provocations\" and to remain committed to the nuclear negotiations.\n\nSouth Korea expressed strong concern and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe condemned the launch, saying it was a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nNorth Korea rejects UN resolutions that ban it from using ballistic missile technology, saying they are an infringement of its right to self-defence.\n\nTalks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled since a second summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February broke down in disagreement over nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe Pukguksong-3 is thought to be a modification of an earlier version tested in 2015 to enhance its range, and was probably launched from a test platform rather than an actual submarine, said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University's Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.\n\n", "description": "North Korea has said it had successfully test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile which was necessary to contain external threats and enhance its self-defence.
