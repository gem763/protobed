(AP) - As the sky cleared and floodwaters receded Saturday, residents of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks began to assess the damage wrought by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nSteve Harris has lived on Ocracoke Island for most of the last 19 years. He\u2019s ridden out eight hurricanes, but he said he\u2019d never seen a storm bring such devastation to his community, which is accessible only by boat or air and is popular with tourists for its undeveloped beaches.\n\n\u201cWe just thought it was gonna be a normal blow,\u201d Harris, a semi-retired contractor, said Friday. \u201cBut the damage is going to be severe this time. This is flooding of biblical proportions.\u201d\n\nGov. Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian. The storm made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than the monster that devastated the Bahamas. Yet despite having been downgraded to a Category 1 storm, it still sent seawater surging over neighborhoods, flooding the first floors of many homes.\n\n\u201cThere is significant concern about hundreds of people trapped on Ocracoke Island,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nHarris lost his car to the storm and his air conditioning is damaged, but he said he\u2019s blessed that his condominium is on the third floor and he is insured. Of the 11 units in his complex, seven had water in them, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a strange picture,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been a regular guest down here for years, you can\u2019t imagine what we saw.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard began landing local law enforcement officers on the island Friday via helicopter and airlifting out the sick, elderly and others in distress, Hyde County authorities said. National Guard helicopters also flew in supplies and a rescue team.\n\nBy Friday evening, the governor said that officials were aware of no serious injuries on the Outer Banks from the storm. People in need of temporary housing were being taken to a shelter on the mainland, the governor said.\n\nConnie Leinbach, who publishes the Ocracoke Observer newspaper, said sheriff\u2019s deputies and other rescue personnel performed at least two rescues from attics. She said the Coast Guard was also called in to help a man who was having problems with his oxygen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ton of water here. It\u2019s more than (Hurricane) Matthew,\u201d Leinbach said, comparing it to the damaging 2016 storm.\n\nDorian is expected to remain a hurricane as it sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard through Saturday. While tropical-storm force winds are buffeting southeastern Massachusetts and could sweep into Maine later Saturday, hurricane-force winds are unlikely to pose any threat to land in the U.S.\n\nCanadian officials are expecting Dorian to remain a Category 1 hurricane when it makes landfall in Nova Scotia later Saturday.\n\nCanadian Hurricane Centre meteorologist Ian Hubbard said Saturday that storm is expected to lose its title as a hurricane as it crosses the province.\n\nHowever, the U.S. hurricane center said that even if Dorian downgrades to a tropical storm, hurricane conditions are expected in portions of eastern Nova Scotia and western Newfoundland by late Saturday or early Sunday.\n\nHubbard said the last hurricanes to make landfall in Canada were Hurricane Igor and Hurricane Earl in September, 2010. Hurricanes in Canada are somewhat rare in part because once the storms reach colder Canadian waters, they lose their main source of energy.\n\nAt least four deaths in the Southeast were blamed on Dorian. All were men in Florida or North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.\n\nAs Dorian closed in, more than a quarter-million residents and visitors were ordered to evacuate the Outer Banks, which stick out from the Eastern Seaboard like the sideview mirror on a car. But many just tied down their boats, removed objects that could blow away from their yards, and hunkered down.\n\nDorian slammed the Bahamas at the start of the week with 185 mph (295 kph) winds, killing at least 43 people and obliterating countless homes. From there, it swept past Florida and Georgia, then sideswiped the Carolinas on Thursday, spinning off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles.\n\nStill, the damage was far less than feared in many parts of the Carolinas, including historic Charleston, South Carolina, which is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms, and Wilmington, North Carolina, the state\u2019s biggest coastal city.\n\n\u201cRight now, it appears we\u2019ve had no loss of life,\u201d Harris said of Ocracoke. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure everybody is safe, but it\u2019s going to be a long recovery.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Virginia.
