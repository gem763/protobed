It's definitely a full renovation needed, we believe it hasn't been lived in for over 30 years.\"\n\nHousing website Zoopla lists the last sale of the Hall as 1999 - it changed hands for a reported \u00a390,000.\n\nIn 2008 the charity Save Britain's Heritage visited the site and explained how the house was not quite beyond saving: \"Although it is empty and neglected, Blaenblodau is not in awful condition - yet.\n\n\"It is only a matter of time before it begins to deteriorate; no building can cope with a lack of maintenance and the onslaught of encroaching vegetation!\"\n\nThe estate agent has made a start on the repairs - John Francis has organised the clearing of the thick undergrowth surrounding the historic home, so that future bidders can at least access the exterior.\n\nThe gate from the main road is also easily repairable, and the long, tree-lined driveway adds a touch of class to what could be a real gem of the area once rennovated.\n\nThe \u00a340k figure is just a guide price - the final number will depend on how many people have been enchanted by the house and want to bid for it.\n\nWhoever does get their name on the deeds will embark on a long journey to restore the house, but at the end of it will join a list of inhabitants stretching back to the mid-19th Century.\n\nAccording to the website britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, the house was advertised for let in 1859 and first appeared on the ordnance survey map in 1888.\n\nCadw, the Welsh agency tasked with protecting historic sites, listed the building in 1992 as Grade II for being a 'largely unaltered late-Georgian style small country house'.\n\nThe listing information states that the house had a simple late-Georgian staircase, six panelled doors, panelled shutters and moulded cornices in the hall and principle rooms.\n\nThe drawing room also had an Adam-style ceiling, which is a neo-classical style of interior design involving intricate detailing on the plasterwork.\n\nA restoration of these features would breathe new life into Blaenblodau Hall, which would stand as a brilliant display of Georgian architecture in the local area.\n\nLocated in Carmarthenshire, southwest Wales, the house does come with land, however development on this is not permitted, say Save Britain's Heritage.\n\nThis would rule out would-be developers, and instead opens the door to somebody who genuinely wants to transform the Hall into a family home again, and save it from the very real possibility of total dereliction.\n\nIf you fancy the opportunity to restore this Georgian beauty and own your very own manor house, then you can attend the John Francis auction in Llanelli on November 27 at 3pm. Bidding starts at \u00a340-50,000.", "description": "The 160-year-old manor house is up for auction in Wales = but it is thought that the property has not been lived in for more than thirty years", "authors": ["Joanne Ridout", "Joshua Minchin"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564882.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_THP_CHP_121019Slug_10653JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
