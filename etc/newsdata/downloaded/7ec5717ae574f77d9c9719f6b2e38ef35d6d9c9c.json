He makes up his mind about a thing, and those who disagree with him \u2014 even those with manifestly more knowledge and experience \u2014 are stupid, or slow, or crazy. As a personal quality, this can be trying; in a president, it is dangerous.\u201d Worse, his laughable conviction that his intuition is always right, his willful ignorance and his contempt for a code of conduct that the military depends upon have led to disastrous results, including a near-military conflict with Iran, an order to abandon the Kurds and the normalization of Kim Jong Un.\n\nEven worse, Trump\u2019s motives are legitimately in question. On virtually every foreign policy move it is fair to ask: 1) Is Trump pursuing private financial interests?; 2) Is Trump doing Putin\u2019s bidding?; 3) Is he politicizing national security to enhance his own image and reelection prospects?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAny Democrat who wants to replace Trump must be able to explain to voters what Trump is doing and how dangerous it is to allow him to continue as commander in chief. They must also provide reassurance that, unlike Trump, they have acquired some proficiency in foreign policy and will not hire pliant yes-men.\n\nThe next debate provides an excellent forum for Democrats to make the case that Trump is entirely unfit as a commander in chief, and that they are prepared to lead from Day One. Even if moderators do not bring up foreign policy, the best candidates will want to inject just enough foreign policy knowledge into the discussion to underscore voters\u2019 impression that virtually any sentient being would be better able to defend America.\n\nTo get them started, they and their advisers should think through answers to questions like these:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy or why not is it a good idea to leave Kurdish troops to fight on their own? What does a situation like this communicate to other allies and foes around the world?\n\nWhat is wrong with asking foreign powers, especially authoritarian ones, for dirt on the president\u2019s rivals. Is such conduct impeachable? Illegal?\n\nHow do you plan to exit Afghanistan without endangering our or our allies\u2019 security? How do you evaluate the risk the Islamic State will reconstitute itself?\n\nHow would you go about restoring American prestige and influence in the world?\n\nName some of the secretaries of state and national security advisers you would use as models for selecting your own team.\n\nAD\n\nFor members of the Senate, when have you taken a foreign position at odds with your base? When have you successfully checked Trump\u2019s foreign policy initiative?\n\nAD\n\nHow do you restore trust and confidence in the intelligence oversight process?\n\nTo what degree does successful soft power rely on the potential deployment of hard power? What does that portend for the defense budget under your administration?\n\nHow do you go about restoring ethics and competency to the State Department and National Security Agency? What consequences should there be for those who committed illegal or unethical acts at the behest of Trump administration officials?\n\nWhat new laws, if any, do we need to prevent abuses and corruption in our foreign policy operations?\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Five questions about the presidential race\n\nJennifer Rubin: The corruption of U.S. foreign policy\n\nAD", "description": "Candidates must be able to undercut Trump's 'America First' sloganeering", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/roYMallGNT0EYtQY0GSx0Ns2qaM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RR32ZUMOYI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
