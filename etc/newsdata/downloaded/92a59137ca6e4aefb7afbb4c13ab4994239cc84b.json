The country is rarely unified but the World Cup showed how we can live in such a great, united country.\n\n\u2018Our squad was led by a group of young men of all races, who grew up in normal families and have worked hard enough to represent our country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In that I see myself; someone who grew up in this country, is proud to be English. Part of being English is knowing that my mum was made so welcome here \u2013 and that has allowed me to grow up with this sense of pride.\u2019\n\nFarai is English on his dad\u2019s side and Zimbabwean from his mum\u2019s side, and he was born and raised in England. He doesn\u2019t believe that Britishness is synonymous with whiteness.\n\n\u2018Being English is not about what you look like, it\u2019s about pride and working hard for the country that unites us.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m well and truly proud of all of my heritage\u2019 (Picture: Jerry Syder for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018My dad is half Italian, which comes from my grandma and granddad meeting as a result of WWII,\u2019 he explains. \u2018My granddad Barney served in the RAF across Europe and made a lifelong Ally in my grandma!\n\n\u2018My mum was born in a small Zimbabwean village and has made one huge journey in life to be living with my dad on the outskirts of London.\u2019\n\nFarai\u2019s mum moved to England in her early twenties, completing university and nurse training. In the years before they had Farai, and for the first few years of his life, the family lived in Rugby \u2013 which was distinctly lacking in multi-racial families in the early 90s.\n\n\u2018When we moved to London it was all so different and we just became part of this vibrant multicultural society,\u2019 says Farai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I imagine it must have been hard for my mum at times when we were in Rugby. Standing out can be such a positive, but it can also can be difficult as some people aren\u2019t receptive to people of cultures they\u2019re not familiar with.\u2019\n\n\u2018Standing out can be such a positive, but it can also can be difficult\u2019 (Picture: Farai Hallam)\n\nFarai has always been strict about saying that he is not black and he is not white: \u2018I\u2019m as much both and very proud to be mixed-race,\u2019 he explains.\n\n\u2018Being mixed-race for me is such a blessing. Not only have I grown up within two cultures, I feel I represent modern England. I\u2019m so proud to be English and I get to show how this country is accepting of anyone and everyone.\u2019\n\nFarai is also incredibly proud of his Zimbabwean heritage and the lessons he has learnt from being immersed in his mother\u2019s culture from the moment he was born.\n\n\u2018I am so grateful to my mum for educating me on her culture,\u2019 says Farai. \u2018Growing up in England, I could easily have been closer to my dad\u2019s side, but I\u2019m well and truly proud of all of my heritage.\n\n\u2018The biggest influences of Zimbabwean culture are respect and family. From as far back as I can remember, I have had it instilled in me to respect my elders and to go above and beyond to help them.\n\n\u2018Zimbabwean culture can be quite strict and, growing up, you can feel the reigns tighten around you, but when you mature and come in to adult life you appreciate the value of the life lessons.\u2019\n\n\u2018The biggest influences of Zimbabwean culture are respect and family\u2019 (Picture: Farai Hallam)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Farai has a pretty enormous family. He has 27 first cousins on his mum\u2019s side \u2013 and that\u2019s really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The culture is so welcoming to everyone that I have third cousins, lifelong family friends, and children of my mum\u2019s friends that I would also call family,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018This can be a bit chaotic at Christmas, but when it comes to having someone to turn to, or supporting someone in the family in need, you know you have an army of people who are there for you.\n\n\u2018The family ethic never lets anyone down, whether it be contributing to tuition fees for family back in Zimbabwe, or paying for flights back home for those who need it, the importance and strength of family is never undervalued.\u2019\n\nFarai loves talking to people about his culture, and he always embraces questions about his heritage.\n\n\u2018Most people are fascinated and want to know more which I\u2019m really lucky to have. I think it all starts with my name, which comes from the Shona language in Zimbabwe.\u2019\n\nWorking in football means that Farai is no stranger to the discussion about racism in sport. Just this week England\u2019s black players faced Nazi salutes and monkey chants from crowds in Bulgaria.\n\nBut Farai says this isn\u2019t wholly reflective of football in this country, and that his experiences of working and playing in the industry over the years have been largely positive.\n\n\u2018Yes, there have been challenging moments, some where my race has been an issue, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the people, experiences and memories I\u2019ve had in football with people of all races.\n\n\u2018The importance and strength of family is never undervalued\u2019 (Picture: Farai Hallam)\n\n\u2018Off the field, football is getting there, it\u2019s not an overnight fix, but any cultural change takes time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarai says that on a personal level he has experienced overt racism only a handful of times in this country, and each time he is always completely taken aback.\n\n\u2018It hit me out the blue and I just didn\u2019t know how to react. One incident, I didn\u2019t tell anyone about for a few years,\u2019 admits Farai.\n\n\u2018One was on the field when I was playing \u2013 it came from a spectator. The most painful part of it was the man who said what he said was stood holding the hand of a young boy.\n\n\u2018Whilst what was said hurt and hit me hard, what really got to me is that a young boy is going to grow up thinking that that language and mindset is OK.\n\n\u2018It took me until full-time to process what was said, and a part of me wanted to brush over it \u2013 which is what I did, but that isn\u2019t the right thing.\n\n\u2018At the time I thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the person that kicks up a fuss\u201d, but I look back at it now and I know I would act very differently and report the issue.\n\n\u2018Until you\u2019ve had it happen to you, you just don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll actually react. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\u2019\n\n\u2018A race doesn\u2019t determine who someone is, what they stand for, or their values as a person\u2019 (Picture: Farai Hallam)\n\nFarai knows there are some specific challenges that come with being mixed-race, but he also thinks that belonging to diverse communities and engaging with your family history can help to build a solid sense of identity.\n\n\u2018Growing up at times it was difficult, there were many moments when people just expected me to be friends with the black boys because I look similar to them, and if I had white friends I was called an Oreo or a Bounty.\n\n\u2018In reality, I\u2019ve got friends from all races who are just good people. In London, the majority of people grow up with friends of all races, religions, creeds, sexualities, it\u2019s just the norm and it naturally makes you a more well-rounded person.\n\n\u2018Being mixed-race is a good thing, in the very first instance it has brought two different races together, ending in a person who is as much one race as they are the other.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t stereotype mixed-race people as this or that, because a race doesn\u2019t determine who someone is, what they stand for, or their values as a person.\u2019\n\nMixed Up Being mixed-race is so much more than just black and white (Pictures: Jerry Syder) Mixed Up is our weekly series that gets to the heart of what it means to be mixed-race in the UK today. Going beyond discussions of divided identity, this series takes a look at the unique joys, privileges and complexities that come with being mixed-race - across of variety of different contexts. The mixed-race population is the UK's fastest-growing ethnic group, and yet there is still so much more to understand about the varied lived experiences of individuals within this hugely heterogenous group. Each week we speak to the people who know exactly how it feels to navigate this inbetween space.\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me to pick a side \u2013 I am mixed-race, so I am both\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Yes, you can still be racist even if you have mixed-race kids\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018I have a really unusual mix \u2013 I love that no one can ever guess where I\u2019m from\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Farai is British and Zimbabwean.
