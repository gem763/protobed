REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The process to appoint the next Bank of England governor remains on track, and parliament will have time to scrutinize the new appointment before Governor Mark Carney steps down, finance minister Sajid Javid said in a letter released on Tuesday.\n\nJavid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, said the appointment would be made this autumn, but members of parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee wrote to Javid last month with concerns that the process had become delayed.\n\n\u201cYou asked for an update on this important recruitment process. It is on track. In terms of the appointment itself, we will make an announcement in due course, ahead of the start of the next Governor\u2019s term on 1 February 2020,\u201d Javid wrote to the committee in a letter released on Tuesday.\n\nThe British parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee typically questions senior BoE staff before they take office, and although it lacks a formal veto, it can pressure officials to step down, most recently with BoE chief operating officer Charlotte Hogg.\n\n\u201cI would like to assure you that the Committee will have the opportunity and time to scrutinize the successful candidate after the appointment has been made but before the individual has taken up the role,\u201d Javid wrote.", "description": "The process to appoint the next Bank of England governor remains on track, and parliament will have time to scrutinize the new appointment before Governor Mark Carney steps down, finance minister Sajid Javid said in a letter released on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438387527&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970JQ", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
