It has installed a government of technocrats led by Hamdok.\n\nOn Wednesday, representatives of the Sovereign Council signed a deal with rebels outlining a roadmap for peace talks at a meeting hosted in the South Sudan capital Juba.\n\nThe deal was signed by the SRF, an umbrella group that includes three of the main rebel factions, among them rebels in Darfur, as well as by Abdelaziz Al-Hilu, leader of a wing of the SPLM-N, the main group fighting against the government in the southern provinces of Blue Nile and South Kordofan.\n\n\u201cHe (Hamdok) is coming to cement the agreement as far as ending the war in Sudan,\u201d said James Wani Igga, South Sudan\u2019s vice president.\n\nHamdok told reporters on his arrival that he would also hold talks with South Sudanese officials on trade, border disputes and the free movement of people between both countries.\n\n\u201cI am looking for a very strategic, very distinguished relationship between our two nations,\u201d he said.\n\nGood relations between the two nations are vital for the flow of oil from fields in South Sudan, which depend on pipelines that go through Sudan.\n\nSouth Sudan obtained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war. The two countries have since frequently accused each other of harbouring or aiding rebels fighting against their governments.", "description": "Sudan's new Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok flew to South Sudan on Thursday on a two-day visit to cement a new plan for peace talks with many of the rebel groups fighting against the government, brokered the previous day by Sudan's southern neighbour.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429097051&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1CK-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
