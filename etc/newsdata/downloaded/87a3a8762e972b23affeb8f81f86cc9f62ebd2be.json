Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe outburst, which began with the Dodgers trailing 2-1, included two-run doubles from Russell Martin and Enrique Hernandez, and a three-run home run from Justin Turner. Martin added a two-run homer in the ninth to finish 2-for-4 with four RBIs.\n\nJuan Soto homered for Washington, which will turn to veteran right-hander Max Scherzer in a win-or-go-home contest at home Monday in Game 4. The Dodgers will go with 39-year-old lefty Rich Hill.\n\nAs for Sunday, Los Angeles right-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu (1-0) allowed two runs on four hits in five innings. He walked two and fanned three.\n\nNationals left-hander Patrick Corbin (0-2) took the loss in relief after surrendering six runs and recording only two outs. He followed starter Anibal Sanchez, who allowed only one run on four hits in five innings while striking out nine and walking two.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t plan for seven-run innings,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters after the game. \u201cBut after the first five (innings against Sanchez) tonight and to see us get back to what we do best, it was really good to see.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals opened the scoring on Soto\u2019s two-run blast in the first. The 20-year-old belted a high fastball 408 feet to center field for his first career postseason homer.\n\nIn the fifth, the Dodgers trimmed the deficit to 2-1. Max Muncy had two strikes against him when he ripped a 398-foot shot to right-center field for his second homer in as many games.\n\nMartin gave the Dodgers a 3-2 lead when he drilled a two-out, two-run double off Corbin in the sixth \u2014 also with a two-strike count. The hit to left-center field drove in Cody Bellinger and David Freese, both of whom had singled (Bellinger on a 3-2 count).\n\nThe inning quickly got away from Corbin, who walked Chris Taylor before giving up a two-run double to Hernandez on a 1-2 count that increased the Dodgers\u2019 lead to 5-2. He then intentionally walked Muncy. That spelled the end of the night for Corbin in his first relief appearance since 2017.\n\nNationals manager Davey Martinez brought in right-hander Wander Suero to face Turner with two on and two out. With the count full, Turner crushed a three-run homer over the wall in left-center field to make it 8-2.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was frustrating,\u201d Martinez said of the Dodgers doing so much damage with two strikes. \u201cThe 0-2 (count), couldn\u2019t put guys away, it was tough. Not taking nothing against those guys, they\u2019ve got pretty good hitters, but we\u2019ve got some pretty good pitching. We got 0-2 and we just couldn\u2019t finish.\u201d\n\nA wild pitch by Dodgers right-hander Joe Kelly with the bases loaded allowed Washington to score a run in the bottom of the sixth. Two batters later, a sacrifice fly by Asdrubal Cabrera cut the deficit to 8-4.\n\nMartin capped off his big night with a two-run homer in the ninth.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Los Angeles Dodgers erupted for seven runs in the sixth inning and never looked back, beating the host Washington Nationals 10-4 in Washington, D.C., on Sunday night to take a 2-1 National League Division Series lead.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437999918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960EX-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
