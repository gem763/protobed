The @GMB logo and time were in an unfortunate position this morning @ITVCalendar #gmb.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Brilliant, that made me smile.\"\n\n\"Perfect positioning of the @GMB logo there ,\" contributes a micro-blogger alongside a crying with laughter emoji.\n\nIt comes after host Ben made a sleepy blunder on Monday's show.\n\nHost Ben Shephard was speaking with a guest live on air, when he made a funny mistake.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLong Lost Family Special: The Unknown Soldiers host Nicky Campbell was on the show to discuss the latest episode, while an ancestor, Paul, of one of the lost soldiers also appeared.\n\nIn the ITV series, Nick, co-host Davina McCall and the team search for family members of initially unidentified soldiers, who were killed during the First World War and buried without graves.\n\nOne soldier named Frank was killed during the war and buried where he fell, and the latest episode of the ITV series reveals his remains were found - along with those belonging to another identified fallen soldier.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe team then tracked down Paul who lived in America, and he was revealed to be the great nephew of Frank - the moment he found out he was a DNA match was filmed for the series, with Davina revealing all.\n\nPaul then appeared on GMB on Monday morning, and it's then that viewers mocked host Ben over his blunder.\n\nAs Ben revealed his story to viewers, he accidentally said that the guest \"fell asleep\" on learning he was related to soldier Frank.\n\nHe said: \"We saw a little clip of you getting the message that it was your Great Uncle and then you fell asleep.\"\n\nQuickly correcting himself, he said: \"... fell asleep.. then you burst into tears.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAs he got back on track, co-host Kate and guest Paul both kept a super straight face.\n\nBut viewers couldn't help see the funny side of the error, taking to Twitter to laugh it off claiming Ben had \"made their morning\".\n\nOne fan said: \"When you found out and fell asleep!? Ben wants to go back bed!\"\n\nAnother tweeted: \"Ben you have literally made my morning,\" while a third said: \"I giggled more than I should have!! Bless Ben.\"\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.", "description": "The morning TV show made an epic blunder after placing their logo in the wrong spot - which led to a naughty word being shown on screen", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715303.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_241019GMB_6743JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
