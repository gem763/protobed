A self-regulatory organization has introduced guidance for cryptocurrency custodians, while a subsidiary of major financial services firm SBI Holdings will conduct compliance policies using blockchain technology.\n\nHere is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph Japan.\n\nJapan Cryptocurrency Business Association releases guidelines on custody\n\nThe Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) \u2014 a self-regulatory organization for the cryptocurrency industry in Japan \u2014 has released guidance for cryptocurrency custody operators.\n\nThe JCBA issued guidelines for crypto custodians ahead of the introduction of the Fund Settlement Act. The organization distinguished the various responsibilities of cryptocurrency custodians and suggested that there should be a difference in the range of virtual currencies that can be handled based on the differences in business characteristics in those assets.\n\nDecentralized gaming platform releases Japanese-language version\n\nThe Sandbox, a decentralized gaming platform, launched a Japanese-language dashboard. The platform allows users to create and monetize characters as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nUsers use VoxEdit to create their own NFT assets and sell them on the marketplace for Sand tokens. Users can then create and host games and contests of various genres such as martial arts and racing.\n\nSBI subsidiary establishes blockchain-based KYC and AML verification\n\nSBI Security Solutions, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, has established a new company that provides solutions for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes with blockchain technology. The new company was formed in a partnership between the SBI subsidiary and international IT firm NEC.\n\nThe new company will be called \u201cSBI Digitrust\u201d and will be capitalized at 300 million yen ($2,766,000), 66% of which will be invested by SBI Security and 34% by NEC. SBI and NEC have jointly conducted pilots using blockchain technology and intend to combine SBI Security's cybersecurity knowledge and NEC's biometric authentication and AI technology.\n\nBitbank cryptocurrency exchange nets 30% share of the domestic market\n\nJapanese cryptocurrency exchange Bitbank has released data showing that its average market share in domestic physical cryptocurrency trading volume is 30%. Citing data from the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, Bitbank COO Hiroyuki Mihara wrote that Bitbank's domestic spot trading share during this period averaged 30.2%.\n\nWhile 30% may seem impressive for a single exchange in a crypto-friendly country like Japan, it represents a decline in market share for Bitbank. Mihara attributed the decline to the fact that several trading pairs for crypto and yen (JPY) are not available on the exchange, including Ether (ETH)/JPY, Litecoin (LTC)/JPY, and NEM (XEM)/JPY.", "description": "Cointelegraph Japan presents a weekly digest of selected cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related news", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZWU1NDJlYTA0OTRlZTM0M2RmMGU0Mjk1YTY3MzYyOGYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
