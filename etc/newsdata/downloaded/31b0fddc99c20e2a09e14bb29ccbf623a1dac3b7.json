Mang\u00f9: Chicken and plantains. That she was in D.C. to see her son and not home in the Dominican Republic was the only indication that this game day was unlike all the others that had come before for the Washington Nationals\u2019 20-year-old phenom in his sophomore season.\n\nIf she is prone to believe in these sort of things, she might have feared that this would be her only chance to watch Juan play in October. Since arriving in Washington, the Nationals have been haunted by an inability to win a playoff series. A fact that was uniquely distilled into nine innings on Tuesday when they played in their first wild-card game.\n\nOther than mom\u2019s breakfast? \u201cI think everything was kind of the same,\u201d Soto says pregame. \u201cI just prayed and get here, and now we're getting ready for the game.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n***\n\nA man named Bob Williams, a lifelong D.C. resident with a plush shark coming out of the belly of his T-shirt, doesn\u2019t like the one-game wild-card playoff structure. Too stressful. To have a whole season come down to this?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even fair for Milwaukee,\u201d he says magnanimously. And fair is a funny concept in sports, especially baseball, but of course this makes sense. Baseball games are too fluky for that to be fair.\n\nWill you feel differently if they win? I ask.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, and I appreciate his ideological consistency.\n\n***\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Craig Counsell managed the Milwaukee Brewers to a division title and his first postseason experience by besting the Chicago Cubs in a winner-take-all Game 163. It was the kind of single-game \u201cseries\u201d that only ever happens immediately after baseball\u2019s seven-month slog because of a tiebreaker or a wild-card game. Last year was the tiebreaker. This year, the Brewers got the wild-card game.\n\nThose games are similar, with the intensity and the stakes of having your whole season come down to this one shot. But ahead of 2019 wild-card game, Counsell talks about what makes them different.\n\n\u201cYou do hedge some things in that game,\u201d he says of the Game 163 his team played last year, with at least a wild-card berth assured. \u201cYou won't be as risky in those games. You will save stuff in a game like that, depending on the score.\n\n\u201cIn this game, you don't.\u201d\n\nNo matter your natural disposition that has to be stressful. I mean, what is pressure if not the acute awareness that the moment for excellence is upon you? Sitting in the interview room of a hostile ballpark before 42,993 fans began booing his team, Counsell doesn\u2019t seem anxious, though. He says that he is calmer as the game gets closer, in fact. The trick, he says, is to think about how you\u2019re about to see something special.\n\n\u201cI look forward to walking in after the game and saying, \u2018Man, can you believe he did that? That was incredible. That was an incredible performance.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe was right. That was incredible.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 01: Milwaukee Brewers catcher Yasmani Grandal (10) reacts after hitting a two run home run in the first inning during the Wild Card game against Washington Nationals starting pitcher Max Scherzer (31) on October 1, 2019, at Nationals Park, in Washington D.C.

The next inning they add a solo shot. Dave Martinez leaves him in, lets him hit for himself. This was going to be the storyline, the decision to second-guess, and the thing considered indicative of an endemic failure in D.C.\n\nIn the fourth inning, the Nationals Park fire alarm goes off and the PA system shuts down. The cheers drown out the silence but the Presidents\u2019 Race is a mess and there is a dissonance to the in-game experience. The Nationals are going quietly into the night, overmatched by the Brewers\u2019 bullpen maneuvering.\n\nIt\u2019s fixed quickly and the team releases a statement, assuring attendants that \u201cThere is no emergency at the ballpark.\u201d\n\nThe jokes write themselves; so do the ledes.\n\nSometime around then, Gerardo Parra finds Soto in the dugout and assures him, \u201cA good moment is going to come, so be ready.\u201d\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t know about this exchange \u2014 which would have happened either way \u2014 except that it did, and he was.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 01: Juan Soto #22 of the Washington Nationals celebrates with his teammates after defeating the Milwaukee Brewers with a score 4 to 3 in the National League Wild Card game at Nationals Park on October 01, 2019 in Washington, DC.

We talk in terms of metaphors a lot in sports \u2014 at least what it all means to a franchise or a city or the next matchup \u2014 but no game is more literal than a wild-card game. The stakes of each play are reflected immediately in the box score. All of the pathos of the sport is reduced to whether you\u2019re moving closer to a win in this one game, and suddenly the whole scene looks a lot more fraught. Each pivotal move erasing the last, to say nothing of the near misses.\n\nConsider the experience of Soto juxtaposed with that of Trent Grisham.\n\nThe Brewers\u2019 22-year-old rookie started the season in Double-A, replacing Yelich in right field after the reigning MVP\u2019s season-ending injury last month. Grisham scored the first run of the 2019 playoffs after taking that leadoff walk. In that way, he could have been the difference-maker. Seven and a half innings later, he misplayed a ball hit by Soto with the bases loaded. Instead of two runs scoring to tie the game, a third run scored on his error, giving the Nationals the lead that would break their October curse. In that way, he was the difference-maker.\n\nWas it the stress of the single-elimination game that got to him? \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says standing in a somber clubhouse of teammates waiting to tell him it\u2019s OK. It stings now but it\u2019s a future of being followed around by that one play that will hurt the most. \"I don't think it got to me at all. I just ended up making an error. It's not my first. It's not going to be my last. It just happened that way.\"\n\nUntil the go-ahead hit that will make him a local hero and immutably tie him to Grisham, Soto was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts. In the fourth inning he misplayed a ball hit by Eric Thames that ended up being a double. By then Scherzer had settled down \u2014 he would only have to get through one more inning before a lights-out Stephen Strasburg made the first relief appearance of his career \u2014 and Thames ended up stranded on third. No one will remember Soto\u2019s miscue. It just happens that way.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 01: Juan Soto #22 of the Washington Nationals celebrates after defeating the Milwaukee Brewers with a score 4 to 3 in the National League Wild Card game at Nationals Park on October 01, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Will Newton/Getty Images)\n\nSoto\u2019s mom is not supposed to go with him to Los Angeles, where the Nationals will face off against the 106-win Dodgers in the National League Division Series. She has to go back to the Dominican, to work, he says.\n\n\u201cI really sad for that, but I try to bring her before everything is done,\u201d he says.\n\nExcept she has to go to L.A., right? They won. A game and a postseason round and the first indelible October moment of an all-time career. And now, since it was publicized and came at exactly the right time, the breakfast, which was just plantains and chicken, has been imbued with meaning. The way that a hit or a miscue, if it happens on a big stage at exactly the right time, can be imbued with the weight of an entire season. It\u2019s not fair, necessarily, but it\u2019s incredible.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With a season on the line, Juan Soto and the Nationals had the moment that reigned supreme in the NL wild-card game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rFzCelIXruSVWP8E.XCSrw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L5eYMjtvKaP7dv73CgfUFw--~B/aD0zMDg5O3c9NDYzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/289ad430-e4e5-11e9-9f9e-17487f1718dd"}
