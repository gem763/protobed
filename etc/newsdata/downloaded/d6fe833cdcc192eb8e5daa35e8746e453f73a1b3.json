Mr. Moore defended far-left policies like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d while Mr. Maher said the country wasn\u2019t ready for such radical change.\n\n\u201cYou were ahead of the curve for so many years,\u201d Mr. Moore lamented. \u201cWhy pull back now, Bill, and say we have to go to the center to be safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the country isn\u2019t there,\u201d Mr. Maher fired back. \u201cThe country is not for Medicare for All. \u2026 As Nancy Pelosi points out, Obamacare is a better benefit. The Medicare for All doesn\u2019t pay for catastrophic, you gotta do that yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Bill, we\u2019re going to beat Trump,\u201d replied Mr. Moore.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not a helpful thing to say,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cAs you know, we\u2019re the two guys who said Trump was gonna win.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say if the election were tonight, Trump would win,\u201d Mr. Moore responded. \u201cThat\u2019s how dangerous it is. \u2026 You have to respect the evil genius of this guy and how he gets away with every f\u2013ing thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, exactly right,\u201d Mr. Maher said.\n\nMr. Maher then cited Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign strategy of branding the Squad, a group referring to far-left Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, as the new face of the Democratic Party.\n\nMr. Moore said he\u2019s OK with that narrative.\n\n\u201cPeople love them. People of color love them. Women love them,\u201d he said of the Squad.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re unpopular,\u201d Mr. Maher responded. \u201cNot one of them has an approval rating above 25%, so you\u2019re making this up. They\u2019re not beloved, these people, because they don\u2019t believe in things a lot of people believe in.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
