She was a casual drinker and figured it would be easy. It was, but she hadn\u2019t banked on learning so much about herself in the process.\n\n\u201cI realized that going out without drinking was something that I really enjoyed and that I was very well suited for,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI realized I\u2019m a pretty extroverted, spontaneous, uninhibited person.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how Listen Bar was born on Bleecker Street downtown. At just under a year old, the bar that Bandrovschi opens only once a month is alcohol-free, one of a growing number of sober bars popping up around the country.\n\nBooze-free bars serving elevated \u201cmocktails\u201d are attracting more young people than ever before, especially women. The uptick comes as fewer people overall are drinking alcohol away from home and the #MeToo movement has women seeking a more comfortable bar environment, said Amanda Topper, associate director of food-service research for the global market research firm Mintel.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Regular bars and restaurants are cluing into the idea that alcohol-free customers want more than a Shirley Temple or a splash of cranberry with a spritz.\n\nAlcohol-free mixed drinks grew 35 percent as a beverage type on the menus of bars and restaurants from 2016 to this year, according to Mintel. Topper said 17 percent of 1,288 people surveyed between the ages of 22 to 24 who drink away from home said they\u2019re interested in mocktails.\n\nThe interest, she said, is also driven in part by the health and wellness movement, and the availability of higher quality ingredients as bartenders take mocktails more seriously.\n\n\u201cIt really started a few years ago with the whole idea of dry January, when consumers cut out alcohol for that month,\u201d Topper said. \u201cIt\u2019s shifted to a long-term movement and lifestyle choice.\u201d\n\nListen Bar recently hosted a mocktail competition for mixologists, who whipped up drinks that included The Holy Would, comprised of citrusy, distilled, non-alcoholic Seedlip Grove 42, palo santo syrup, low-acid apple juice, lemon and lime bitters produced with glycerin, and verjus, the pressed juice of unripened grapes. The drink is the brainchild of Fred Beebe, a bartender at Sunday in Brooklyn. The restaurant isn\u2019t alcohol-free, but Beebe helped create an extensive mocktail menu that goes well beyond the sugary choices of yore, using unique ingredients.\n\nPalo santo, for instance, is a tree native to Peru, Venezuela and Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula that loosely translates to \u201choly wood\u201d and is widely used in folk remedies.\n\n\u201cEverybody should be able to have a delicious drink at a bar,\u201d Beebe said. \u201cHospitality is making sure everybody has a good time. Alcohol, for me, is not the most important part of a cocktail anymore. The cool juices and syrups and tinctures and mixtures and all that stuff makes a lot of the fun.\u201d\n\nListen Bar has enjoyed packed houses every month. Photographer Zach Hilty, 40, was a first-time guest on competition night. He said he drinks alcohol occasionally.\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend and I are interested in the health benefits of different botanicals and such,\u201d he said.\n\nCat Tjan, 27, of Jersey City, New Jersey, was also on hand and brought a colleague, Ammar Farooqi, 26, from Williamstown in southern New Jersey. Neither drinks alcohol. Tjan said Listen Bar is the only sober bar she could find in Manhattan, where she works for a drug company.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in it,\u201d she said of booze. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly fun. It\u2019s very expensive. There are better ways to have a good night out.\u201d\n\nMany bartenders will mix up regular cocktails and just leave out the alcohol if you ask, but that\u2019s different than choosing something conceived as virgin from a separate menu, Farooqi said. Mocktails generally cost a few dollars less than cocktails, but separate menus are still hard to find.\n\nAt the sober bar Getaway in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, mocktails go for $13 a pop. There\u2019s the Paper Train, with lemon juice, tobacco syrup (from the leaf and containing no nicotine), vanilla and San Pellegrino Chinotto. And there\u2019s A Trip to Ikea, a mix of lingonberry, lemon, vanilla, cardamom and cream. Getaway opened in April in a permanent space.\n\n\u201cWeekends are generally really busy,\u201d said co-owner Regina Dellea. \u201cMy business partner\u2019s brother is in recovery and when he first got sober they missed having a space to hang out in at night, where you can meet up and just talk.\u201d\n\nMainstream suppliers are catching on. Beer companies are experimenting with alcohol-free selections, and Coca-Cola North America gobbled up the popular Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water. The U.K.\u2019s Seedlip brand bills itself as the world\u2019s first non-alcoholic spirits. It comes in three flavor profiles with ingredients like hand-picked peas from founder Ben Branson\u2019s farm in the English countryside.\n\nAt Listen Bar, Tjan and Farooqi sipped on a mocktail dubbed Me, A Houseplant, a green concoction comprised of Seedlip\u2019s Garden 108 variety (the one with the peas), cucumber, lemon and elderflower. Each glass was garnished with a hefty cucumber slice. It was thought up by Jack McGarry, co-founder of the booze-serving Dead Rabbit bar in lower Manhattan and a well-known mixologist.\n\nMcGarry is also three years sober. At Listen Bar\u2019s \u201cGood AF Awards,\u201d he was one of the judges, clipboard in hand.\n\n\u201cAlcohol-free used to be very simplistic with, like, homemade lemonades and ginger ales. People are wanting more diverse offerings,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued at how it will all shake out. I\u2019ve seen lots of trends come and go. When people come in asking for non-alcoholic drinks, we have a bunch of drinks that have been thought out.\u201d\n\nChris Marshall in Austin, Texas, has been sober since 2007. He was once a drug and alcohol counselor whose clients often shared their frustration at not having an alcohol-free nightspot to frequent. They were his motivation for founding Sans Bar in Austin, with pop-ups all over the country, including Anchorage, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., Portland, Seattle, New York, Nashville and St. Louis.\n\n\u201cThe response is just overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking out community spaces, coffee shops and places like that. The lack of a social circle is the one thing so many of my clients lacked after treatment.\u201d\n\nMarnie Rae Clark, who lives outside Seattle, is also a recovering alcoholic. She\u2019s experienced the struggle of socializing while sober and started a blog about the sober lifestyle in 2017. She founded National Mocktail Week this year. Part of her mission is to encourage bars and restaurants to up their mocktail games.\n\n\u201cI just want to be able to go out with my friends and have a nice grown-up sophisticated cocktail,\u201d said the 51-year-old Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s really about promoting inclusion and connection in the hospitality industry.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Booze-free bars serving elevated \"mocktails\" are attracting more young people than ever before, especially women.", "authors": ["Leanne Italie"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19241752728988.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
