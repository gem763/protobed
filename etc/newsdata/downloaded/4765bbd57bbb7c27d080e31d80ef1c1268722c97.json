At 0846 GMT the banking index was up 0.3%.\n\nIn its ruling the court said that if, after unfair terms were removed from the agreements, \u201cthe nature of the main subject matter of those contracts is likely to alter, in that they would no longer be indexed to a foreign currency while remaining subject to an interest rate based on that currency rate, EU law does not preclude that annulment of those contracts.\u201d\n\nMichal Sobolewski, an analyst with BOS brokerage said it would be up to individual courts to decide in particular cases, adding: \u201cThe ruling means that the indexed credit may be converted into zloty, while keeping the Swiss interest rate. This is unfavorable for banks.\n\n\u201cThe ruling is a bit vague, leaves space for interpretation, which means that the risk for banks is a bit smaller than expected,\u201d he said.\n\nOther analysts said consumers could only ask courts to annul their contracts, which would mean they have to repay the whole debt. However, the amount of the credit would be calculated on the basis of the Swiss franc rate from the day the credit was taken.\n\nThat would be much lower than current rates and favor of consumers.\n\nForeign currency loans now total 124 billion zloty ($31 billion), almost one third of all Polish mortgages.", "description": "The European Union's (EU) top court ruled on Thursday in favor of Polish consumers who took out mortgages in Swiss Francs, allowing them to ask Polish courts to convert their loans into the local currency.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
