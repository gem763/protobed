We didn't hear of any breaches or any major problems in this issue,\" he said to loud applause from lawmakers.\n\nEgypt passed a restrictive anti-protest law in 2013 after el-Sisi led the military ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president and leader of the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group Mohamed Morsi. A renewable state of emergency remains in force.\n\nEl-Sisi regularly invokes his track record of bringing relative stability in a turbulent region and boosting the economic outlook after introducing harsh austerity reforms in 2016.\n\nEgypt devalued the pound and slashed subsidies three years ago in its bid to secure a $12bn loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nForeign reserves have been replenished at record-levels, reaching more than $45bn last month and the pound's value is slowly rebounding.\n\nHowever, prices have soared for the average citizen, economically squeezing Egypt's burgeoning poor and middle class, triggering discontent.\n\nMadbouli acknowledged the economic pressures affecting Egyptians but said \"building a country\" was an arduous process requiring a large budget.", "description": "Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli denounces Egypt's demonstrations as part of 'brutal war' designed to create 'confusion'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/5287d7d390fc480abb08553f45055ea9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
