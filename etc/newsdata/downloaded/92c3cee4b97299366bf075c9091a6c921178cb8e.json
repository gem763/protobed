It has sold 12 million copies and famously spawned a whopping seven Top 5 hits, but the legacy of Rhythm Nation is deeper and darker than its commercial success. The catalyst for Jackson\u2019s magnum opus was a moment in U.S. history that would come to herald a harsh, ugly facet of contemporary American life.\n\n\u201cI remember when we were working on Rhythm Nation with Janet, and we had this concept for a song\u2026 We were watching CNN and there had been a school shooting and all these kids had been getting killed and we just thought, we gotta talk about that on a record,\u201d remembered Jimmy Jam.\n\nIt was Jan. 17, 1989, when white supremacist Patrick Purdy murdered five children and wounded 32 people\u2014mostly Southeast Asian refugees\u2014at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, California. The tragedy would shock the nation, and occurred just a decade after the similarly-named 1979 Grover Cleveland Elementary School shooting in San Diego, California, when 16-year-old Brenda Spencer opened fire on schoolchildren from her apartment window. The Stockton shooting was particularly devastating for the mostly Vietnamese and Cambodian student body and community.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, as far as a school, it\u2019s not your child who\u2019s been killed,\u201d former Cleveland Elementary School second-grade teacher Julie Schardt said in 2013, recalling that fateful day. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of the children you are responsible for. You are the main nourisher. You give them sustenance. Especially in primary\u2014you are a parent. In loco parentis. You\u2019re a counselor. You feed them. You\u2019re a nurse. All of those things.\u201d\n\nSchardt was one of the teachers that had to identify bodies in the immediate aftermath of the carnage, and never forgot seeing the body of her 8-year-old student, Oeun Lim. \u201cIt was such a surreal experience. I remember it was cold, and I remember her red shoes.\u201d\n\nIt was this horrific incident that inspired Janet Jackson\u2019s topical fourth album Rhythm Nation 1814. A concept album from the production/songwriting duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, it remains a standout for Janet. Coming on the heels of the monstrous success of Control\u2014an album that produced five Top-10 singles and landed a nomination for Album Of the Year at the 1987 Grammys\u2014there were high expectations and tremendous pressure for what the youngest Jackson would do for a follow-up. A lot had changed in popular music: the rise of dance-pop divas like Jody Watley and Paula Abdul led to whispers that Janet had been usurped; the emergence of new jack swing had dominated black music in 1988 and into 1989, making the slick, classic Minneapolis sound-inspired gloss of Control seem like yesterday\u2019s news; and perhaps most significantly, hip-hop was suddenly at the forefront of black music and culture, with Public Enemy\u2019s magnum opus It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back courting commendation and controversy by giving voice to black rage at the end of the Reagan era as crack, guns, and the 1990s loomed.\n\nWith so much shifting in black music, Janet Jackson sought to do something more ambitious than a collection of catchy singles about how grown up she was. Working elbow-to-elbow with Jam and Lewis, they would take the conceptual approach of Nation of Millions and marry it to the hard-hitting brand of new jack swing Jimmy and Terry had showcased expertly on New Edition\u2019s Heart Break album in 1988. This wasn\u2019t going to be a Control sequel, and Janet\u2019s approach to the album was not without hurdles.\n\nBefore the project could even get off the ground, her adviser and unofficial manager, A&M\u2019s Director of Urban Music John McClain, complicated things. McClain had guided Janet\u2019s career following the disappointing reception to her first two albums, helping to propel her Control breakthrough. But while the label didn\u2019t want Jackson to buck the formula that made Control work, there was the contradictory issue with McClain, who also didn\u2019t want to pay Jam and Lewis for work on a follow-up. He started Janet on a project with new producers, but the star recognized the potent chemistry she\u2019d had with Jam and Lewis, and cut ties with McClain as her manager before convincing A&M to bring Jam and Lewis back on board. And she wasn\u2019t interested in rehashing the themes of maturity and independence that had defined her breakthrough album\u2014not with Spike Lee\u2019s Do the Right Thing still in theaters and political hip-hop forcing tougher conversations into popular music. And not after what happened in Stockton.\n\nPatrick Purdy was a dysfunctional drifter who\u2019d developed a hatred for Asian immigrants and an affiliation with the Aryan Nations. While studying welding in San Diego, Purdy was heard to complain about the number of Asian students. The 24-year-old had an affinity for guns; he and his brother were arrested for shooting semi-automatic weapons in a state park. Around noon on Jan. 17, 1989, Purdy descended upon the elementary school he himself had once attended. After setting his van on fire with a Molotov cocktail, Purdy turned his AK-47 on a schoolyard full of children and opened fire\u2014killing Rathanar Or, age 8; Ram Chun, 8; Sokim An, 6; Thuy Tran, 6; and Oeun Lim, 8.\n\n\u201cI remember the trauma of having students killed and wounded on a playground at a school. And a school is supposed to be a safe place for children,\u201d Schardt said this past January, as survivors recalled that fateful day on its 30th anniversary.\n\n\u201c I feel that most socially conscious artists\u2014like Tracy Chapman, U2\u2014I love their music, but I feel their audience is already socially conscious\u2026 \u201d \u2014 Janet Jackson\n\nAt a time when most of the biggest black pop stars were making music that seemed almost preoccupied with reaching the whiter regions of the Top 40, Janet was making music that was as unapologetically R&B as a Bobby Brown album. \u201cBlack Cat\u201d notwithstanding, Janet Jackson was firmly planted in the sounds of contemporary R&B. And it gave her an audience so many \u201cserious\u201d coffee-house favorites of the era wouldn\u2019t have reached.\n\n\u201cI feel that most socially conscious artists\u2014like Tracy Chapman, U2\u2014I love their music, but I feel their audience is already socially conscious,\u201d Janet told Rolling Stone in early 1990. \u201cIt\u2019s like college kids, that whole thing. I feel that I could reach a different audience, let them know what\u2019s going on and that you have to be a little bit wiser than you are and watch yourself.\u201d\n\nFor all its topicality, Rhythm Nation isn\u2019t exactly brimming with incendiary rhetoric. Many of the album\u2019s biggest hits\u2014smashes like \u201cMiss You Much,\u201d \u201cEscapade,\u201d \u201cAlright,\u201d \u201cCome Back to Me,\u201d and \u201cLove Will Never Do Without You\u201d\u2014eschew commentary for bright, infectious sentiment; or in the case of the hard-rocker \u201cBlack Cat,\u201d dejected aggression. But it\u2019s the recurring themes of poverty, social injustice, child abuse/neglect, and racism that give the album its weight\u2014even with so much romantic effervescence on display. Interludes make clear the album\u2019s sociopolitical spirit, and the title track is the kind of anthem \u201cWe Are the World\u201d aspired to be, but it avoids schmaltz with booming Sly & the Family Stone-sampling production and a delivery as aggressive as a Chuck D verse.\n\nBut \u201cLiving in a World They Didn\u2019t Make\u201d is the closest direct reference to the tragedy of Cleveland Elementary. With its emphatic outro of \u201cSave the babies,\u201d the song closes with a news snippet about the shooting:\n\n\u201cThis just in: at least 5 people are dead, and 30 others wounded, after a gunman opened fire at a California school playground, and then killed himself. Apparently, the gunman, armed with an automatic rifle, shot the kids\u2019 door...\u201d\n\nReleased on September 19, 1989, Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814 proved Janet\u2019s superstardom was no fluke; and it proved she had the vision to separate herself from her famous family\u2019s legacy and reinvent herself without seeming calculating or hollow. A commercial and critical smash, it launched Janet into the \u201890s as one of the biggest artists in the world. Albums like Control\u2014and later on, Velvet Rope\u2014were personal affairs that exposed her ambitions and insecurities, but Rhythm Nation showed that she was just as formidable when her focus was outward.\n\n\u201cYou know, a lot of people have said, \u2018She\u2019s not being realistic with this Rhythm Nation,\u2019\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Oh, she thinks the world is going to come together through her dance music,\u2019 and that\u2019s not the case at all. I know a song or an album can\u2019t change the world. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing what we\u2019re doing to help spread the message.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three decades since Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814, and the tragedy of Stockton is echoed in the horror stories that have unfolded at Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas and more. As long as our ugly reality remains tethered to the violence of that day and so many others, that message, however utopian, is still one worth spreading.", "description": "Thirty years ago today, Janet Jackson released \u201cRhythm Nation 1814\u201d\u2014her most topical album yet, and one inspired by a horrifying mass shooting that still echoes.", "authors": ["Stereo Williams"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568870339/190918-stereo-jackson-tease_v8fcvy", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
