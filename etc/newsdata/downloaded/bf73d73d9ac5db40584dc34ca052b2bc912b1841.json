Here\u2019s a perfect impeachment defense.", "language": "en", "text": "The Washington Examiner had just published a conversation in which Conway mocked and demeaned a reporter, describing herself as \u201ca powerful woman\u201d and threatening to have the White House expose details about the reporter\u2019s personal life. Now Conway was fielding questions about that episode and about Trump\u2019s confused impeachment response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no coherent message coming out of the White House on impeachment,\u201d one of her interrogators observed.\n\nConway attempted to refute that observation \u2014 with 20 minutes of incoherence.\n\nShe spoke about due process. She spoke about Andrew Johnson. She said Adam Schiff is a liar. She spoke about Nixon. She spoke about unmasking the whistleblower. She spoke about Bill Clinton. She spoke about corruption in Ukraine. She spoke about the Founding Fathers. She spoke, in no particular order, about fake news, cross examinations, the Second Amendment, Robert Mueller, parking tickets, Nancy Pelosi, Twitter trolls, \u201ccable news cranks\u201d and journalists\u2019 \u201cpresumptive negativity.\u201d She challenged the character of witness William B. Taylor Jr., Trump\u2019s acting ambassador to Ukraine. She called Democrats an \"angry mob\u201d trying to \u201cundo\u201d the 2016 election and \u201cinterfere with\u201d 2020. She offered various explanations for why it wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo to ask for a probe of Joe Biden while suspending military aid. She explained why this clear violation of election law would be neither a high crime nor a misdemeanor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSomewhere in the middle of this ramble, Conway proposed an entirely new defense of Trump\u2019s behavior with Ukraine: Regardless of what happened, it wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo because Trump did not desire in his soul for it to be a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo intended,\u201d she reasoned. \u201cI think intent matters. And when people say \u2018this is what the president intended, this is what the president believes\u2019 \u2026 you don\u2019t know that. So let\u2019s take a deep breath and stop pretending we know what\u2019s in somebody else\u2019s heart, mind or soul.\u201d\n\nGenius! Trump can never be impeached because what matters is what is in his heart and his soul, and only he knows that. Likewise, he can\u2019t be prosecuted for shooting somebody on Fifth Avenue (as the administration argued in court this week) because we cannot know where his heart and soul intended the bullet to go.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have been complaining that the White House lacks a consistent message on impeachment. The main defense \u2014 about the secrecy of the process \u2014 will become irrelevant when proceedings become public next month. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham complained on Fox News. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s like you\u2019re fighting a ghost, you\u2019re fighting against the air.\u201d\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s that there is no good defense.\n\nReally, the problem is the White House has too many messages \u2014 and none of them very good. Consider some of the lines Trump and his allies have tried in recent days:\n\nThe call was perfect.\n\nThe emoluments clause is phony.\n\nAdam Schiff is a corrupt liar.\n\nAD\n\nAdam Schiff is the whistleblower\u2019s secret informant.\n\nBill Taylor is part of a coordinated smear campaign by radical unelected bureaucrats.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats are an angry pack of rabid hyenas.\n\nWhat are Democrats hiding in their Soviet-style star chamber?\n\nHuman scum!\n\nIt\u2019s a coup!\n\nNo, it\u2019s a lynching!\n\nNo, it\u2019s a witch hunt!\n\nThe few attempts at a coherent defense have crumbled. \u201cNo quid pro quo\u201d became \u201cWe do that all the time.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell disputed Trump\u2019s claim that McConnell described the Ukraine call as \u201cinnocent.\u201d Reporting by The Post and the New York Times undermines the claims that Ukraine didn\u2019t know the funding was withheld and that Trump\u2019s real motive was fighting corruption.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s solution to the stream of bad news: He ordered the White House to cancel its subscriptions to those two newspapers.\n\nThat\u2019s too bad, because Trump and his aides now won\u2019t be able to read this coherent, straight-from-the-soul message I have developed for him, guaranteed to put an end to impeachment:\n\nAD\n\nI am in way over my head.\n\nI have no idea what\u2019s legal or illegal.\n\nMy staff is incompetent.\n\nI wasn\u2019t supposed to win the election.\n\nYou can\u2019t impeach me \u2014 because I quit.\n\nInterested in following Dana Milbank\u2019s take on the impeachment inquiry?
