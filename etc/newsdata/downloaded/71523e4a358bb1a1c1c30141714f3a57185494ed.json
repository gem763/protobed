Uefa\u2019s final step is for the referee to abandon the match.\n\nHowever, the abuse persisted and the match was again paused shortly before half-time, after England manager Gareth Southgate made a further complaint to a Uefa official.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate spoke to the fourth official with around five minutes of the regular 45 to go, while defender Tyrone Mings was seen asking an assistant referee, \u2018Did you hear that?\u2019 during the first half and Nazi salutes were seen among a section of the home fans.\n\nAfter a short discussion, England\u2019s players elected to return to the field of play. Moments later, Raheem Sterling scored to give England a 4-0 lead at the break. England eventually won the match 6-0.\n\nBulgaria captain Ivelin Popov then became involved in a heated debate with a section of home supporters near the tunnel as the rest of the players headed for the dressing rooms at half-time.\n\nThe Levski Stadium was subject to a partial closure for this match after Bulgaria were sanctioned for racist chanting during qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic.\n\nAt the half-time interval ITV pundit Ian Wright described it as a \u201cgreat day\u201d in trying to tackle racism.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible day for the Bulgarian people and how they have been represented, it\u2019s a great day in respect of trying to tackle racism.\n\n\u201cWe can see over in that stand, with those (anti-racism) banners, which mean nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a set of fans who do not care and need educating.\u201d\n\nThe former Arsenal and England striker continued: \u201cAs a black player, we\u2019ve heard it for many years about walking off.\n\n\u201cBut you do need your white players to do that for you, so you can go off together. When that can happen, when you can see how powerful that is, that will do something.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualification match against Bulgaria was twice halted by the referee on Monday night because of racist chanting in the crowd.
