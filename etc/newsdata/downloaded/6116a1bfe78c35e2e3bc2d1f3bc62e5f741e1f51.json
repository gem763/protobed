In London, 33 per cent of couples would choose to secure the keys to their first home before walking down the aisle.\n\nHannah Bernard, head of mortgages at Barclays, said: 'With house prices at an all-time high, it's no surprise that young couples see a joint mortgage as the ultimate act of modern-day commitment.'\n\nBut it's not just young couples who are committing to mortgages outside of marriage - buying with friends or siblings is becoming an increasingly popular option for aspiring homeowners, according to research from M&S Bank.\n\nIts research showed that 60 per cent of those aged 18 to 35 said they would consider taking out a mortgage as a group to make home ownership a reality, compared to just 26 per cent of people aged over 36.\n\nBuying a house with friends or a partner: how to protect yourself If you're planning on buying a home with your other half or are looking to buy with friends, there can be serious financial risks involved if you don't take the right precautions. Read our guide on how to protect yourself when buying a home with others\n\nThe survey found that a fifth of millennials do not believe they will be ever be in a position to own their own home.\n\nSaving for a deposit was stated as the main barrier, with 59 per cent of 18 to 35-year-olds having less than \u00a31,000 in savings.\n\nPaul Stokes of M&S Bank said: 'Many young people are trapped in Generation Rent because house prices seem increasingly out of reach.\n\n'For many, home ownership appears possible only through sacrificing certain aspects of their current lifestyle \u2013 be that moving to a different area, moving to a smaller property than they're renting, or seeing their disposable income take a significant hit.\n\n'But our research has shown that millennials are keen for an alternative option \u2013 and joint home ownership is one of them.'\n\nMost millennials would take a mortgage with two or more people to get on the property ladder\n\nWhat are the risks of buddying up to buy?\n\nBuying with friends or as an unmarried couple may give young people a foot onto the property ladder that they wouldn't have otherwise had, but there can be serious financial risks involved if the right steps aren't taken.\n\nThe risks involve everything from unequal deposits or mortgage contributions failing to be properly accounted for when the property is eventually sold, to one person wanting to move out while the other wants to remain.\n\nThese are issues for both those buying as a couple, or with friends.\n\nWhile marriage comes with a series of legal protections in the event of divorce, for unmarried cohabitants a break down in the relationship could see awkward negotiations.\n\nAside from added legal costs, there is also the risk of one party wanting to sell their share of the property before the other - and of course there is the issue of who gets what once the property is sold.\n\nThere are some simple steps you can take however to protect yourself against complications further down the line.\n\nTraditionally, homes have been owned as joint tenants.\n\nAs joint tenants, the home's equity is owned equally, regardless of what was individually contributed in terms of a deposit.\n\nIf one party dies then ownership of the property will automatically transfer to the other owner. If a couple split up then the default position is that you both own the property equally.\n\nAs joint tenants you cannot leave a portion of your home to anyone else in your will.\n\nBuying and owning as 'tenants in common' rather than joint tenants can mean that each person owns a defined part of the property, whether this is 50 / 50 or unequal shares.\n\nTaking measures such as signing a 'declaration of trust' can help ensure you and your co-buyers get back what you put in when it comes time to sell the property - or protect you in the event that your co-owner dies.\n\nThe declaration of trust can include:\n\nThe percentage split of how the property is owned\n\nHow much each party contributed towards the cost of buying the home and that specific sums should be returned to them first before the remaining proceeds are split\n\nHow responsibilities for the mortgage or any other expenses should fall\n\nHow the property should be divided if the owners split up\n\nThose buying with friends, family, or a partner should discuss these matters and how to own the property with their solicitor and agree things before going ahead with a purchase, particularly if putting in unequal shares.", "description": "An increasing number of young couples are considering taking out joint mortgages early on in their relationships  - or buying with friends and family  to clamber on the housing ladder.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
