Here\u2019s how to get inside.\n\nThere are three vaults on the map: one near Lava City, one near the Train Yard, and one near the Geyser. All three will appear on your minimap once you get a key. Keys have a chance to drop from loot drones when you shoot them down. It seems the keys drop from drones that have a red tile; the colour of the drone when you shoot it doesn\u2019t appear to matter.\n\nVaults take a few seconds to open. Inside, you\u2019ll find some fancy loot, which you can see through the door. In the video below, the player finds some gold and purple armour and purple attachments.\n\nI haven\u2019t opened a vault myself yet, though I\u2019ve stared longingly through their doors. Note there can be more than one key in a match, so getting one is no guarantee you\u2019ll get those goodies. A few players feel this messes up the balance of loot and can make high-tier armour and attachments available too early (though this also gives you a chance to snag that loot from its owners if you take them down). We\u2019ll see if the sentiment becomes prevalent enough for Respawn to address it as players continue getting into the vaults.", "description": "Since the start of Season 3, Apex Legends\u2019 map has been dotted with locked vaults full of high-tier loot.
