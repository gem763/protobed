I\u2019m going to keep it real with y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nT-Pain, whose legal name is Faheem Rasheed Najm, told fans that whenever concerts are canceled, it\u2019s because of low ticket sales. It\u2019s wrong, he said, to use an excuse.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI appreciate the tickets that we did sell, even though the ticket sales were very low, and they were low because we didn\u2019t set it up right,\u201d he said, mentioning that he and his team were running on the fuel from his last tour.\n\nThrough representatives, T-Pain declined to comment.\n\nAs T-Pain plots out his next move for his album, Berklee College of Music professor George Howard said it\u2019s one of the best courses of action T-Pain could\u2019ve taken.\n\nThe 30-year music business veteran and professor of music business management said it\u2019s rare for anyone in any discipline to admit fault.\n\nAD\n\nT-Pain\u2019s confession appeared genuine to Howard, but he said he also wouldn\u2019t doubt if the Instagram announcement would help T-Pain.\n\n\u201cAll these people who were not talking about T-Pain are now talking about him,\u201d he said, noting his own interest. \u201cHe went from a very one-dimensional artist to a human being.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRumors about low ticket sales swirled around fellow rapper Nicki Minaj this year when she canceled two shows at the last minute, citing technical difficulties at the venues and leaving angry fans in Bratislava, Slovakia, and Bordeaux, France, in her wake. Ticket sales were also slow in London, according to the Guardian.\n\nCanceling shows is unfair to fans who spend their \u201chard-earned money,\u201d T-Pain said Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hold on to a mistake just because you spent a long time making it,\u201d he said.\n\nHoward agreed that planning a tour within a month based on another tour is a bad idea. Most artists don\u2019t have enough brand power to last them for such stretches unless they are superstars, he said.\n\nT-Pain has had three No. 1 hits on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart and 46 songs overall to have entered the charts. His second album, released in 2007, was the sole release out of his six records to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart, according to Billboard.\n\nAD\n\nHe had a resurgence of attention this year when he was revealed to be the masked singer on the hit Fox show \u201cThe Masked Singer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Howard said about T-Pain\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cPerhaps this is a tipping point and perhaps our elected officials will take note of that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Singer T-Pain cancels upcoming tour because of low ticket sales, something that could be a turning point for musicians and honesty.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gCtgAdh0G57UHSyLerxHJnOLu-U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3Q74LRXLTYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
