But it\u2019s easy to make mistakes and overlook factors that are critical to changing careers effectively.\n\nSo, when leaving the security of a steady job to transition to a new career, you\u2019ll want to avoid the following five mistakes. That way, you\u2019ll embark on your next voyage with grace and confidence.\n\nMistake No. 1: Not \u2018testing\u2019 your new career first\n\nYou think you\u2019ll love your new career path, but you won\u2019t know for sure until you\u2019ve immersed yourself in it. So, before interviewing for a new job in a new field, try to experience what it would be like.\n\nStart by figuring out what spare time you have to dedicate to your trial run. You may need to get creative if the job would be an office position and you currently have one. In that case, find lunch hour times or take half-days to shadow others in positions for which you might apply.\n\nAlso see: You\u2019re likely to be out of a job in your 50s \u2014 4 ways to prepare and minimize the pain\n\nIf possible, test the waters online. For example, if you want to move into marketing and already have some marketable skills \u2014 like design or writing \u2014 create an account on Upwork, the online platform for freelancers.\n\nYou could also apply for short-term gigs or projects that let you flex your skills, gain experience and better understand what you might be doing daily.\n\nMistake No. 2: Not managing expectations\n\nSwitching careers, especially after 50, can be a big change financially, mentally and emotionally. You may need to move down on the totem pole, which can be challenging if you haven\u2019t set your expectations properly. Set realistic goals.\n\nThe key is to be prepared to learn. Some of the work skills you\u2019ve acquired already, such as communications and organization, will be critical to your success in your new field. Find ways to excel with the capabilities you have, while gaining new ones.\n\nMistake No. 3: Not knowing what matters most\n\nWhen switching careers, it\u2019s easy to take the first opportunity you find because you\u2019re worried you won\u2019t be qualified for anything else. That mind-set can stick you in a position you don\u2019t want.\n\nRelated: How to make a successful career change after 50\n\nSo, before making a switch, figure out what matters most to you. Do you want full-time or part-time work, or does that not matter? Are you open to travel? Do you need consistent work hours or remote work opportunities? Know what you need, and make it clear to potential employers. That way, you\u2019ll be more likely to be happy with your new path.\n\nThis kind of planning saves you from wasting time pursuing the wrong jobs and lets you focus on positions you\u2019d most want.\n\nOne tip: Don\u2019t blurt out your work requirements in a first job interview. Instead, focus on your skills and the job\u2019s fit. Once you\u2019re sure the job is one you want and the employer is interested in you, then you can start talking about your preferences for your working hours and location.\n\nMistake No. 4: Not seeking training first\n\nIt may be wise to acquire new skills before making a career switch. Otherwise, jumping in to a new field too quickly can set you back.\n\nInstead of getting in over your head, setting yourself up for failure and stress, go slowly, carving out time for training on the side while you stay in your current position. This not only enhances your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but also provides you with valuable hands-on experience that will make you a better job candidate when you are ready to change careers.\n\nResearch the skills expected of candidates in the field you hope to enter. Then, seek training opportunities that will give you a leg up \u2014 and an inside look into the work required.\n\nSearch for online, self-paced courses that you can take at home. Also, consider in-person conferences, workshops and events that offer learning opportunities as well as networking.\n\nMistake No. 5: Not having a Plan B\n\nYou\u2019re enthused about your new career, but it\u2019s important to do a reality check. A career change can be risky, and doing it without a backup plan can leave you with no paycheck or job. That\u2019s why you need a Plan B if the new job doesn\u2019t pan out, the interviews don\u2019t go well or you decide your intended path is not right for you.\n\nAlso read: Why everyone should save like they\u2019re going to retire early\n\nYou don\u2019t need another job lined up for Plan B, though. Just set yourself up for success if things fall through.
