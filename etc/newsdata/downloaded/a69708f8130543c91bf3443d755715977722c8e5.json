This is my sixth season here and I am in an unbelievable environment here.\n\n\u201cThe training ground is amazing and we have the best stadium in the world. But football is about glory, it is about winning.\n\n\u201cOf course you can be frustrated and disappointed sometimes.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to get back there and I told you we are going to fight to try to make this possible to try to change the history of this club.\u201d\n\nIt is not only results this season that have contributed to Pochettino\u2019s grizzly mood as he revealed the Champions League final defeat to Liverpool was one of his lowest moments in the game.\n\n\u201cIn football I suffered two big disappointments,\u201d he said. \u201cOne when I was a player and there was the penalty at the World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt was always my dream to play in a World Cup, my massive, big dream.\n\n\u201cOK, we played three games and went home \u2013 when we were a candidate to win.\n\n\u201cFor three or four years we were unbeaten. We didn\u2019t lose and we arrived in a circumstance that went the worse and we were out in the group stages. I stayed at home and didn\u2019t go out for 10 days.\n\n\u201cAnother day was with Tottenham to win a trophy and the closest to win a trophy was of course the Champions League and it was made even bigger because it was the Champions League.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the final of the Champions League with Tottenham \u2013 no one expected that.\n\n\u201cIt was more than a dream, more than a dream. In that moment I felt disappointed and then I took a train to Barcelona and again you are like depressed.\n\n\u201cAnd of course you expect (clicks his fingers) because in your mind after a week you move on and say, \u2018I want to, again, be there\u2019 and when you, sometimes, I explain, because I don\u2019t want to go back on my words for different reasons \u2013 yes, we have some disagreements, of course, you cannot be happy.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be happy. But I am happy now because I am positive and of course this season is going to be another massive challenge to change the game and have that energy to try to be contenders and try again to fight for big things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try until the end.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino admits Tottenham\u2018s poor start to the season has left him hurting, but he is committed to turning their fortunes around.
