Giuliani told ABC News' Kyra Phillips on Saturday that he has no knowledge he's under investigation and that no one from the Department of Justice had contacted him about Parnas or Fruman.\n\nAs foreign actors and governments continue to implement a wide range of tactics to penetrate and hold sway within America's political landscape, these unsealed charges raise questions about the extent to which individuals with foreign allegiances are leveraging political ties to undermine campaign finance safeguards and gain influence, experts said.\n\n(MORE: 2 men with ties to Giuliani arrested on campaign finance charges, bond set at $1M)\n\n\"The charges of conspiracy to funnel foreign dollars into U.S. elections against Florida businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman paint a troubling picture of the free flow of foreign money into our elections due to insufficient safeguards and lax enforcement,\" Paul S. Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation for Common Cause, another watchdog group, said in a statement. \"[Thursday's] indictments, though, likely represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of foreign meddling.\"\n\nPHOTO: This Facebook screen shot provided by The Campaign Legal Center, shows President Donald Trump standing with Lev Parnas, top left photo, at the White House in Washington, posted on May 1, 2018. (AP) More\n\n\"Both men were also heavily involved in the efforts by the White House and President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Trump's political rival, Joe Biden,\" he added.\n\nLoopholes in campaign finance law\n\nParnas and Fruman are not the first allegedly to try buying political influence, and they likely won't be the last to defy existing rules, experts told ABC News.\n\nBut their alleged actions bring new scrutiny on the current apparatus and the lawmakers and officials responsible for patrolling it. The entire system operates in relatively new terrain after the blockbuster 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The court's conservative majority in the case ruled unconstitutional a longstanding federal law prohibiting corporate \"independent expenditures\" supporting or opposing federal candidates under the First Amendment.\n\n(MORE: From a controversial phone call to impeachment calls: A Trump whistleblower timeline)\n\nRyan said the advent of Citizens United, which fueled the rise of super PACs, political actions committees that can accept unlimited donations, unlike candidate committees and regular PACs that are limited, is the main reason the two Florida residents may have been able to easily conceal their identities while contributing to super PACs.", "description": "The criminal \"dark money\" case involving two men with ties to President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has raised more questions about how presence of foreign money in U.S. elections can enable nefarious actors to take advantage of a political system powered by cash.
