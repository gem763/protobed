Soon after, Taymir Burnet of the Netherlands won the first preliminary heat of the men\u2019s 100 meters.\n\nThe open-air stadium, which will be used for the 2022 World Cup, is air-conditioned. Temperatures outside hovered around 99 degrees (37 Celsius).\n\nLater Friday, there is qualifying for events including the women\u2019s 800, before the women\u2019s marathon is held in at midnight on the streets of Doha.\n\nThe championships run through Oct. 6.\n\n___\n\n2.49 p.m.\n\nThe midnight marathon is going on as scheduled at the steamy track and field world championships in Qatar.\n\nMeet organizers notified the teams midday Friday that no changes in the schedule for the women\u2019s race were being made, and that they would reassess the situation after nightfall.\n\nThere had been speculation that the event might be postponed because of sweltering conditions. At 2:30 p.m. local time, it was 99 degrees (37 Celsius) in Doha with a \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature of 122 (50 C). The forecast for the midnight race through downtown Doha is 89 (31.6 C).\n\nThere are 69 women on the start list, planning to race against each other and tackle conditions they rarely face. Meet organizers will have extra medical staff on the course looking for signs of heat exhaustion.\n\nInside the open-roofed stadium, where air conditioning is keeping the track about 20 degrees cooler than in the city where the marathon will be run, the meet will start Friday evening with qualifying for the men\u2019s 100 meters. Defending champion Justin Gatlin, American Christian Coleman and Canadian Andre De Grasse are among the medal contenders.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the world track and field championships (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/qatar_athletics_worlds_08783_c0-233-5568-3479_s1770x1032.jpg?a5a0d838ef6c4cc1ed50475c9b5d454f6fdede4f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
