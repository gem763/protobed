The commission cuts will create near-term growth headwinds for the group, but one analyst said Monday the sell-off is a buying opportunity in one top broker stock.\n\nThe Analyst\n\nUBS analyst Brennan Hawken upgraded E*TRADE Financial Corp (NASDAQ: ETFC) from Neutral to Buy and cut his price target from $45 to $41.\n\nHawken also downgraded TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: AMTD) from Buy to Neutral and cut his target from $40 to $33.\n\nThe Thesis\n\nHawken said E-Trade has attractive assets and strategic upside, and the stock\u2019s 14.4% drop in the past week has created a compelling risk-reward opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhile recent price cuts have clearly lowered earnings power for the industry, we believe the corporate services and active trader franchise, which lend themselves to stronger growth, larger margin balances, and a higher proportion of derivatives trading are attractive,\u201d Hawken said in the note.\n\nHawken named E-Trade his top stock pick among discount brokers.\n\nWhile Hawken said TD Ameritrade shares are fully pricing in the negative earnings impact of eliminating commissions, there's no clear path to multiple expansion in the near term. Given the company doesn\u2019t have a permanent CEO in place, Hawken said investors will also likely be waiting a while before a clear long-term strategy is in place.\n\nLooking ahead, Hawken said it\u2019s unlikely TD Ameritrade will be able to outgrow its peers, and valuations among the discount brokers are likely to converge, limiting TD\u2019s upside.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nThe aggressive sell-offs among broker stocks in the past week may have ultimately created some long-term buying opportunities if brokers are able to offset lost fee revenue via other means, such as payment for order flow. However, until investors get a baseline sense of what to expect from the brokers in a zero-commission landscape, near-term risk will remain elevated in the group.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
