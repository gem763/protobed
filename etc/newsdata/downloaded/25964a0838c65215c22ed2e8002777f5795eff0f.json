Long live club football.\n\nA fortnight of inching closer towards settling qualification for Euro 2020 has come to an end and finally the real stuff can take centre-stage again.\n\nSpain sealed their place in next summer's tournament on Tuesday night, and now La Liga returns with plenty at stake as we enter matchday nine.\n\nReal Madrid sit top of La Liga and remain the only undefeated side in Spanish top division\n\nBarcelona and the rest of the top-flight sides return to action following the international break\n\nThe top three has now taken on a more familiar look, with Real Madrid top - despite the intense speculation surrounding Zinedine Zidane's future - ahead of Barcelona and neighbours Atletico.\n\nAll three play on Saturday with Champions League fixtures to fulfil in the midweek after.\n\nBut it's the surprise-package of the season so far, Granada, who kick off Spain's domestic weekend on Friday night. Sportsmail take a look at that, and the key fixtures to come...\n\nGranada vs Osasuna - Friday 8pm\n\nNo one is surprised by the identity of the top three in Spain, but no one predicted who would sit fourth just eight games into the season.\n\nNewly-promoted Granada have upset the odds to move into that fourth Champions League spot, but fell to defeat at the Bernabeu on matchday eight.\n\nTheir squad cost just \u00a38m and many expect the bubble to burst at some point.\n\nGranada have been the surprise package in La Liga after just eight games of the season\n\nThe visit of 11th-placed Osasuna presents a huge opportunity to get back to winning ways.\n\nOnly three players departed on international duty over the last fortnight and the first team were back in training last week with no injury concerns reported for any of the key players.\n\nThree points will send the Nazaries temporarily into second before the big boys return to action 24 hours later.\n\nEibar vs Barcelona - Saturday 12pm\n\nSaturday's early kick-off sees Barcelona aiming for a fourth straight win to fully consign their early-season struggles to the past.\n\nBarcelona will profit from having a fit and fully-rested Lionel Messi to call upon at Eibar\n\nMATCHDAY EIGHT Friday October 18 Granada v Osasuna 20.00 Saturday October 19 Eibar v Barcelona 12.00 Atletico Madrid v Valencia 15.00 Getafe v Leganes 17.30 Real Mallorca v Real Madrid 20.00 Sunday October 20 Alaves v Celta Vigo 11.00 Real Sociedad v Real Betis 13.00 Espanyol v Villarreal 15.00 Athletic Bilbao v Valladolid 17.30 Sevilla v Levante 20.00\n\nErnesto Valverde will be expecting to have Jordi Alba and Junior Firpo back from injury, but Gerard Pique misses out after picking up a suspension for his fifth booking of the campaign against Sevilla, so too Ousmane Dembele who was sent off in the same game.\n\nEibar come into the game with a bit of form behind them. They've lost just one of their last five La Liga games and will be in front of their own fans.\n\nBut history is dead against the Basque side in this fixture.\n\nIn 10 league games between the two Barca are unbeaten, winning nine in the process and with an aggregate scoreline of 33-6.\n\nThere doesn't seem much chance of Eibar ending their drought here.\n\nA stuttering start by the champions can be put down to injury issues. With Lionel Messi back and well rested from missing the international break, they are primed to begin this latest stage of the season with a comfortable win.\n\nAtletico Madrid vs Valencia - Saturday 3pm\n\nOn paper the biggest game of the weekend takes place at the Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday.\n\nDiego Simeone's Atletico side have been goal-shy this season, scoring just seven times in eight games - and just twice in their last five league fixtures.\n\nDespite the teething problems that come with a new-look side missing its former standard-bearer in Antoine Griezmann, Atletico sit third in the table and only three points off the top.\n\nJoao Felix and Atletico Madrid have struggled in front of goal in the early stages of 2019-20\n\nValencia have been rejuvenated in recent weeks and have risen up to eighth in the table\n\nAs crises go, this is a fairly mild one. Valencia were engulfed in their own a month ago, resulting in the sacking of manager Marcelino.\n\nAlbert Celades took charge and is unbeaten now in his last four, after tasting defeat on his opening game away at Barcelona.\n\nThat includes a hard-fought 1-0 win away at Athletic Bilbao, where Valencia gave as good as they've got and created four clear-cut chances.\n\nThey've risen up to eighth in the table, three points behind Atletico, and look well set up to further frustrate their weekend opponents.\n\nReal Mallorca v Real Madrid - Saturday 8pm\n\nIt's a case of 'crisis, what crisis?' at Real Madrid. Zinedine Zidane's side sit two points clear at the top of the table and remain the only undefeated team in the Spanish top-flight.\n\nThat record should not be under threat this weekend.\n\nEden Hazard finally ended his goal drought for Real Madrid before the international break\n\nMallorca rarely trouble Real Madrid, who have won their last five meetings though this is their first since 2013.\n\nMallorca broke a three-game losing streak with a timely win over Espanyol before the international break, but Vicente Moreno's men are languishing in 18th in the table.\n\nGareth Bale and Luka Modric are injury doubts for Madrid, with both absent from training this week.\n\nA must-win Champions League away trip to Galatasaray lies in wait on Tuesday night, with Madrid having picked up just one point from their first two group games.\n\nZidane may well prioritise the arduous trip to Turkey, but they should still have too much for Mallorca.\n\nReal Soceidad v Real Betis - Sunday 1pm\n\nAn intriguing meeting of north and south is the pick of the games on Sunday. Two consecutive defeats have seen Real Sociedad drop out of the top four.\n\nBut they host a struggling Real Betis, who have so far failed to build following an encouraging 10th-place finish last season and a summer of squad-building.\n\nBetis spent big on the likes of Nabil Fekir and Borja Iglesias but have won only two of their opening eight games.\n\nMartin Odegaard (Centre) has been pivotal to Real Sociedad's rise up the league table\n\nReal Betis striker Loren Moron has had an excellent start to the season in the Spanish league\n\nThey sit two points and two places above the relegation zone, with pressure on head coach Rubi just four months after he took charge.\n\nBut there is hope for Betis, who possess the league's unlikely joint-top scorer in Loren Moron.\n\nSociedad, by contrast, are enjoying something of a renaissance under Imanol Alguacil.\n\nA vibrant young side, spearheaded by the rejuvenated Martin Odegaard, have climbed up to fifth in the early stages of this season.\n\nA return to winning ways at the weekend will see them well placed to build on it with fixtures against Celta Vigo and Levante as they target an assault on the top four.\n\nPS\n\nDon't forget, it's the second derby of Madrid this weekend. Getafe host Leganes on Saturday evening with the visitors still looking for their first win of the season.\n\nAlaves host Celta Vigo with both sides on the hunt for points, just one and two points above the relegation zone respectively.\n\nVillarreal (at Espanyol), Athletic Bilbao (home to Valladolid) and Sevilla (home to Levante) are also in action as they try to climb from the top-half into the top-four conversation", "description": "As club football looms ever closer following the international break, Sportsmail take you through the standout fixtures in La Liga this weekend.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784234-0-image-a-20_1571224001270.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
