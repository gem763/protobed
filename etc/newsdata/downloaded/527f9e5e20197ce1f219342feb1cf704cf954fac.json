All EU nationals who arrive in the U.K. before Brexit day are eligible to apply and must do so by December 31, 2020 if the U.K. leaves the EU without a deal or by June 30, 2021 if there's a deal.\n\n\u201cIf EU citizens have not registered by this point in time and do not have an appropriate justification for that, the current immigration rules will be applied,\u201d Lewis told Die Welt. He added that the settled status process had been launched to prevent EU citizens from \u201cgetting caught up in such a situation.\u201d\n\nEU nationals who have not applied to formalize their status will be subject to \u201cthe existing immigration rules,\" Brandon Lewis said.\n\nThis is the first time the U.K. government has set out its intended consequences for EU nationals who do not secure settled status.\n\nHowever, the government must pass new legislation if it is to introduce immigration restrictions for EU nationals. Freedom of movement would not automatically end if the U.K. leaves the EU without a deal because EU law will continue to apply until its foundation is repealed.\n\nApproximately 1.5 million of the roughly 3.6 million Europeans living in the U.K. have secured settled status through the scheme, according to the latest figures released by British government earlier this week.\n\nThe3million group, which represents EU citizens living in the U.K., said: \u201cIt is not too late to stop this madness of turning law abiding citizens into unlawful residents. The status can still be made automatic, put into law now, and for the EU Settlement Scheme to be changed from application to registration.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary Christine Jardine said: \u201cI am absolutely appalled. Brandon Lewis has finally confirmed what we\u2019ve known all along: Boris Johnson has no intention of keeping his promise to automatically guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. \"\n\n\"EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbors and we want them to stay,\" a Home Office spokesperson said in a statement. \"The EU Settlement Scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the U.K. immigration status they need. We\u2019ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they\u2019ll be given a further opportunity to apply.\"\n\nCristina Gallardo contributed reporting.", "description": "Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis says \u2018existing immigration rules\u2019 would be applied to EU citizens without settled status.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Zia Weise", "Cristina Gallardo", "Zoya Sheftalovich"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1134484076-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
