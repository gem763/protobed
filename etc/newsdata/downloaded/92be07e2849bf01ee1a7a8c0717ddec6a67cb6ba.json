House Democrats have finally launched their three-year-long project to get this president for merely winning the 2016 election. We all knew this was going to happen. In 2018, the Democrats retook the House based on stopping Trump. They tried to get a reason to impeach from the Trump-Russia collusion myth, but there wasn\u2019t enough. And by that, I mean there was zero evidence to prove the Trump team colluded with the Kremlin. They waited. And now we have this second-hand account from some whistleblower with political bias against the president who alleged that Trump shook down the Ukrainian president, pressuring him to open a corruption investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, in exchange for military aid. That was proven false by the administration\u2019s release of the call. There is no favor. In fact, the favor centers on Trump asking the Ukrainians to help the Department of Justice\u2019s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nAdam Schiff just made up what President Trump said during his call with Ukrainian President Zelensky \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 26, 2019\n\nAdam Schiff is now doing a fictional retelling of the transcript. This is bizarre. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 26, 2019\n\nOh look, Acting DNI Director Joseph McGuire is on Capitol Hill. Many in the media reported yesterday he was resigning, which was false. \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 26, 2019\n\nSchiff starts by asking a question if the whistleblower complaint alleges \u201cserious wrongdoing\u201d by the committee. Realizes he didn\u2019t recognize the acting DNI for his opening statement. The acting director, Maguire, says he\u2019s not political and has served under eight presidents \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 26, 2019\n\nDNI: The White house *did NOT* assert executive privilege over whistleblower complaint. \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) September 26, 2019\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence John McGuire is now testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, where Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), in his opening remarks, re-wrote the transcript to make Trump sound like a mob boss. This is the lengths the Left will go to get Trump, just making stuff up. Is it shocking? No. We all know Democrats lie, but the extent and breadth that is has taken post-2016 are notable. I mean, Schiff recites lines that are just not in there:\n\nRep. Schiff re-writes the call transcript for added drama: \"I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good, I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it, on this and on that, I\u2019m going to put you in touch with people\" pic.twitter.com/1rV7BpEN6o \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 26, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s all you need to know. In fact, that\u2019s all you need to watch from this hearing if you\u2019re not paid to watch it. If you\u2019re a voter and are interested, feel free\u2014but the fact that the Democrats are now twisting public documents to fit their narrative only reinforced everything we know and think about the Left and their lust to impeach Trump. You all know this is political theater. And yes, with the transcript public, we will notice when the Left tries to sneak in a salacious and totally false rewrite.\n\nThese clowns formally launched the impeachment campaign before even reading the complaint. Schiff later said this remark was done as a \"parody.\" Yeah, whatever you say, sir.", "description": ".09/26/2019 12:40:16PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/3bbe62de-7a45-453d-844e-7d8a20ffc26b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
