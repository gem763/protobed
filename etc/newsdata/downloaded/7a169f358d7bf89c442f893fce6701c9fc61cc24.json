But the lack of quality is frightening, really.'\n\nWhile Keane was hugely critical of both sides for their first-half performance, the former United skipper praised McTominay for displaying the only real bit of quality in what was a woeful first 45 minutes at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nScott McTominay produced the only bit of quality to break the deadlock in the 45th minute\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised for Arsenal after an offside call was overturned\n\n'The one bit of quality we've seen in the whole half \u2013 fantastic strike,' Keane added. 'It was shocking for the first 40 minutes.'\n\nEven former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas couldn't resist having a dig at the quality as he asked his followers to try and find positives about the game.\n\nThe Monaco man tweeted: 'Thoughts on the game so far without using a bad word? Try to be creative.'\n\nAt full-time co-commentator Gary Neville claimed the second-half had been an improvement, but Keane was not impressed back in the studio.\n\n'Gary must've been watching a different game, I thought the second half was shocking \u2013 really poor.\n\n'Arsenal responded well but United will be kicking themselves as Arsenal were there for the taking. Not too many positives.'\n\nKeane believes that neither side have the quality to finish in the top four this season\n\nSokratis Papastathopoulos looks on after Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Manchester United\n\nMarcus Rashford missed a chance to score in the first-half after being played through on goal\n\nOn the evidence of Monday night, the former United captain believes both clubs will struggle to secure Champions League qualification next season.\n\nWhen asked who will finish in the top four, he replied: 'On tonight's performance \u2013 none of them.\n\n'United have to invest but on tonight's performance, it would be West Ham and Leicester to break in.'\n\nFellow pundit Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal have the edge due to their wealth of attacking talent.\n\n'I'll say Arsenal because there's more goals in them with Lacazette and Aubameyang, he said.\n\n'United are forever known for flying wingers but always a massive goal threat, I don't see it changing. Have they got the players to be clinical? I don't think they have.'", "description": "It took a staggering 28 minutes for either side to have a shot on goal in the first half before Scott McTominay broke the deadlock with a thunderous effort on the stroke of half-time.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy", "James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/21/19125046-0-image-a-16_1569875700556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
