Belgium\u2019s Charles Michel takes over as president of the European Council on December 1.\n\nHowever, in a combative press conference, Oettinger challenged the narrative that EU budget costs for countries will rise significantly after 2020. EU countries remain hugely split on the budget proposal and Germany in particular has been vocal as part of a \u201cfrugal five\u201d grouping concerned to limit spending in Brussels.\n\nOettinger said suggestions Germany\u2019s budget bill would double to \u20ac33 billion are \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d and are \u201clies\u201d not in line with the numbers discussed by the Commission with Berlin. Over the weekend, the Financial Times reported German government estimates that \u201cshow Germany would be hit with a sharp rise in its net EU budget contributions, from \u20ac15bn in 2020 to upwards of \u20ac33bn in 2027. \u201d\n\nThose figures did not specify how the numbers were calculated or whether inflation had been taken into account. According to Oettinger, Germany\u2019s net contribution to Brussels is expected to be \u20ac18.1 billion in 2018 prices for 2021 and \u20ac23.5 billion in 2018 prices for 2027.\n\n\u201cYou've got seven years of inflation, seven years of increase in GNI\u201d to take into account, Oettinger said.\n\nThe commissioner also made the case that net payers benefit from a range of programs indirectly, pointing to funding to help refugees in Turkey, funds for border security, and the space program. Oettinger showed reporters a chart chronicling the decline of agriculture spending as a share of the EU budget over the past decade and the rise of new priorities, which include research or investment funding.", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be progress up to December, but no agreement,\u201d Commissioner Oettinger said.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/h_55588474-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
