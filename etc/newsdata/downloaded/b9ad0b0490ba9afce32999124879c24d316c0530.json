(Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has never done a sequel. And though his latest movie, Joker, is set in an expansive comic book world, the idea of a second film always seemed unlikely. That just wasn\u2019t the way it was constructed. Joker is a character piece. A provocative, standalone ode to \u201870s cinema. But then this weekend happened.\n\nJoker grossed almost $140 million over its first three days, becoming the largest October opening of all time. That kind of success almost always means a sequel \u2014 but in previous interviews, co-writer and director Todd Phillips has frequently said \u201cno\u201d to the idea.\n\n\u201cWe really like that this movie lives on its own,\u201d he told ET, for example. However, in other interviews he also made it sound like a sequel was more about Phoenix\u2019s interest than himself or anyone else.\n\n\u201cI would do anything with Joaquin Phoenix, any day of the week,\u201d Phoenix told Total Film back in August. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody like him. If he was willing to do it, and if people show up to this movie, and Warners came to us and said, \u2018You know what? If you guys could think of something\u2026\u2019 Well, I have a feeling that he and I could think of something pretty cool.\u201d\n\nSo, maybe, it\u2019s ultimately up to Phoenix. Would he be up for revisiting a character for the first time? A new interview has surfaced that suggests he just might.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t stop thinking about [the character],\u201d Phoenix told Popcorn With Peter Travers in an interview posted last week. \u201cI talked to Todd a lot about what else we might be able to do, in general, just to work together, but also specifically, if there\u2019s something else we can do with Joker that might be interesting. So, it ended up being a dream role. It\u2019s nothing that I really wanted to do prior to working on this movie.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s certainly a change of pace.\n\nHe continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is [more to do]. Me and Todd would still be shooting now if we could, right? Because it seemed endless, the possibilities of where we can go with the character.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full interview. The moment in question is 21 minutes in.\n\nThough these quotes are a bit of a pivot from what everyone was saying before the film\u2019s release, one thing does seem certain: If Phoenix and Phillips were to come back, it almost certainly would be to further explore Arthur Fleck. The idea of Joker versus Batman is not something Phillips has expressed interest in. Like, at all.\n\nAs many of you now have seen, the film ends in a very open-ended manner, with Fleck ultimately embracing the comic book persona fans have become familiar with over the years just before the credits roll. There\u2019s certainly much more that could happen from there. Plus, there\u2019s even a popular theory that, because Bruce Wayne is so young in the film, Fleck isn\u2019t the \u201creal\u201d Joker but merely the inspiration for an even more horrible person. So, if Phillips and Phoenix wanted, that idea of Fleck inspiring someone else could be a way to dovetail Fleck\u2019s story with a version of the Joker that does meet up with the Caped Crusader. They could have their cake and eat it too.\n\nAll of that is purely speculative, of course. It also ignores the moral and social issues the film has brought up for many people \u2014 issues that even the studio itself seemed sick of dealing with as it would not let the press do interviews at Joker\u2019s premiere.\n\nMoney is great, but making a Joker sequel may not be worth it for the amount of negative press it would surely generate. On the other hand, shouldn\u2019t artists be free to create their work, no matter what the reaction?\n\nAs you can tell, this idea is much bigger than making a simple sequel. It\u2019s also worth noting that, though Phoenix made these encouraging comments recently, they don\u2019t really mean anything. He could change his mind. He could backtrack. Anything is possible. The only real information on whether a Joker sequel will happen is surely flowing through Warner Bros. and the offices of Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips as we speak. However, while the idea of a sequel at first seemed unlikely, now it\u2019s just a little less so.\n\nJoker is now in theatres.", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix has never done a sequel.
