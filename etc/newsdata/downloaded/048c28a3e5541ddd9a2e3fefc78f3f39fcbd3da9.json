On Thursday afternoon, he killed three police officers and another member of staff and injured two other officers before being shot dead.\n\nPolice continued to search his home and to assess data from his computers and phones on Friday.\n\nQuestions remain over what might have led him to carry out the attack, which is being treated as potentially a personal issue. He first attacked three police officers who worked in the intelligence unit of police HQ. There were no witnesses present and all three officers died, so there were no details of what he might have said or any reasons given for the attack. He then went out into a stairwell and attacked another staff-member.\n\nThe attacker was said to be a quiet and unassuming member of staff and the interior minister said no change in his behaviour had been noted in the weeks before the attack.\n\nThe incident is so far being investigated by a regular Paris police unit and being treated as a murder, not a terrorist case. There is so far nothing to suggest the case should be passed to the anti-terrorist police.\n\nThe man\u2019s home was being searched and his wife interviewed by police. French media reported she had told police her husband had \u201cheard voices\u201d the night before the attack and had woken suddenly in the night.\n\nLe Monde reported that the assailant had converted to Islam 18 months ago, but initial searches at his home showed no sign of any radicalisation. He was not on any watchlist.\n\nThe attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest against low wages, long hours and an increasing suicide rate in their ranks.", "description": "Incident in which four officers died treated as murder and not yet referred to anti-terror unit", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/383885246a59da40d17ca0c736efec27efbfaf77/0_273_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2771905b3f73a7af2d46a36bfd8fe823", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
