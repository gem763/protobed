I\u2019d been in the new room for a few weeks when I got the call from Human Resources. A pleasant-sounding young man said, \u201cMr. Mosley, it has been reported that you used the N-word in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d\n\nI replied, \u201cI am the N-word in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d\n\nHe said, very nicely, that I could not use that word except in a script. I could write it but I could not say it. Me. A man whose people in America have been, among other things, slandered by many words. But I could no longer use that particular word to describe the environs of my experience.\n\nI have to stop with the forward thrust of this story to say that I had indeed said the word in the room. I hadn\u2019t called anyone it. I just told a story about a cop who explained to me, on the streets of Los Angeles, that he stopped all niggers in paddy neighborhoods and all paddies in nigger neighborhoods, because they were usually up to no good. I was telling a true story as I remembered it.\n\nSomeone in the room, I have no idea who, called H.R. and said that my use of the word made them uncomfortable, and the H.R. representative called to inform me that such language was unacceptable to my employers. I couldn\u2019t use that word in common parlance, even to express an experience I lived through.", "description": "The worst thing you can do to citizens of a democracy is silence them.", "authors": ["Walter Mosley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/opinion/sunday/08mosley/08mosley-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
