The target was always after the next international break.\n\n\u201cNaby is close. He could be in training when we come back from (Liverpool\u2019s Champions League group stage match against) Napoli next week.\u201d\n\nNewcastle are 14th in the table under new manager Steve Bruce but Klopp is not taking them lightly after they beat Tottenham Hotspur away last month.\n\n\u201cThey are very difficult to play against,\u201d the German said. \u201cThe style is similar to last season. They defend with a big heart. It won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed by the things they have done so far. Newcastle had something like 20% possession against Tottenham but they deserved the three points. They will fight like crazy.\u201d\n\nLiverpool are seeking their fifth victory of the season and a club record-extending 14th straight top flight win. Klopp\u2019s side are also unbeaten at Anfield in their last 40 league matches.\n\n\u201cIt was clear we had to change things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to make Anfield a fortress again. We created a proper basis together, it became more difficult for teams to get something.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker will be out until after the next international break in mid-October but midfielder Naby Keita should return to training with the first team next week, manager Juergen Klopp said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429459663&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1D7", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
