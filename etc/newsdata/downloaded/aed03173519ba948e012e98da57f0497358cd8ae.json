A petition, signed by more than 28,000 people, was handed to the State Government by activist group GetUp earlier this week.\n\nBut Premier Daniel Andrews said he could do nothing to stop the festival going ahead because of a \u201cdeficiency in the law\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow we need to deal with that, but in the interim we need to call this out as a hateful event,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation Commission\u2019s Dvir Abramovich said the festival was how the group reaches people with its hateful messages.\n\n\u201cThese types of gatherings are often used as an effective tool by racist extremists to inspire and recruit people for their warped cause,\u201d he told the ABC.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the recent massacres in Christchurch, Santiago, Pittsburgh and El Paso, there is a direct link between words, incitement and mass shootings.\u201d\n\nHuman rights campaign director for GetUp!, Shen Narayanasamy, told 3AW\u2019s Tom Elliot that bands would use the platform to encourage the killing of Jews and Muslims.\n\n\u201cThese groups are actually linked to international neo-Nazi organisations and they have been banned in other countries because, as often happens with these kinds of groups, words have moved to actual bullets, violence and hatred and actual murder of innocent people,\u201d she said.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Attorney-General Jill Hennessy said the Government was planning to make a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into anti-vilification protections.\n\nThe festival follows disturbing revelations about two separate events in Melbourne schools where Jewish students were targeted.\n\nOn one occasion, a young boy was forced to kiss the shoe of another student while others filmed with their phones.\n\nOn a separate occasion, a five-year-old boy was allegedly called a \u201cJewish cockroach\u201d by classmates.", "description": "White supremacists deemed part of a terror group overseas are holding a music festival in Melbourne this Saturday that the Victorian Government is powerless to stop.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7e7e9c65fda0e860366753d69c9173cc?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
