Scott is currently recovering from a knee injury and occasionally staying over at the \u201cRise and Shine\u201d star\u2019s home with their daughter, Stormi. He recently fell during a performance in New York, even telling the crowd, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie, I think I just like, broke my knee right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not anything new that they spend a lot of time together,\u201d a source told People. \u201cEven after they decided to take a break, they still spent time together with Stormi. And Travis was always free to come and go at Kylie\u2019s so he can see Stormi,\u201d the source explains. \u201cNow when he isn\u2019t working, his free time is all about Stormi. Kylie and Travis always had fun co-parenting, but you can tell that Kylie is happy Travis isn\u2019t working right now. She is happy that he is around.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been clear via social media that the former couple is on good terms. Jenner recently posted a video of her playing Stormi a remix of her viral \u201cRise and Shine\u201d riff, which prompted her daughter to ask for her dad\u2019s music instead.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s girl,\u201d Jenner wrote along with two eye roll emojis and a heart eyes emoji.\n\nThe source also hinted at the possibility of reconciliation between Jenner and Scott.\n\n\u201cHe still might need knee surgery in L.A. and then he will recover at Kylie\u2019s too,\u201d the source added. \u201cAnd as special holidays are coming up, they will continue to spend a lot of time together. They both seem great together. There is definitely hope things will work out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The former couple have been hanging out as of late.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oRRM7cR5insFlVfznHY9DQ--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/4d60c73411c446c32a2e11c362005759", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
