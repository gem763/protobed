He was not able to take care of himself, Thiers said.\n\nOn Sunday, Joel Parks' sister came to check on him and called 911 when she discovered his body at the grandmother's apartment.\n\nThe Bradenton Herald reports Joel Parks' father is dead and his mother is estranged.\n\nInvestigators say Lillian Parks will likely be charged with second-degree murder once she's released from a doctor's care. They're awaiting a toxicology report to reveal the substance used to kill Joel Parks.\n\nThiers said police don't know how long Parks had been dead before his body was discovered. Investigators spent Tuesday interviewing family members.\n\n\"This is a difficult case for our detectives,\" Thiers said. \"Partly, we feel bad for an individual who feels that the only option is to take another human being's life because you're so worried about their care after you're gone.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, this was a process that was thought out, it was planned, and she took a human life,\" Thiers added.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Bradenton (Fla.)
