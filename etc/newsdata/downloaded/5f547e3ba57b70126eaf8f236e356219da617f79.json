As part of this initiative, leaders from across the world have joined together in a collective outreach to youth to engage in issues and understand the power of their voice. Film Your Issue 2018 will be the leading youth engagement for the global Everyone Matters initiative, which advocates for everyone\u2019s right to dignity and respect and to thrive with unique individuality.\n\nAll youth age 8 to 22, anywhere around the world, are being invited to submit short videos at www.FilmYourIssue.com about an issue that matters to them, whether it be local, national or international. The powerhouse roster of jurists will include Maribel Perez Wadsworth, President of the USA TODAY NETWORK and Associate Publisher of USA TODAY. The jurists will select finalists, which USA TODAY will showcase. In addition, USA TODAY will provide marketing support to raise awareness for the campaign. Everyone Matters global initiative will also post select submissions and all finalists on its YouTube channel. Deadline for submission is May 14, 2018.\n\n\u201cIt is more critical than ever for young people to not only engage in issues but add to the dialogue on issues that affect their world,\u201d said Andy Yost, Chief Marketing Officer, GANNETT. \u201cUSA TODAY is proud to be part of this initiative whose aim is to give a platform for young people that are passionate about an issue to speak up and make a difference. USA TODAY at its core is built to empower the communities it serves, and this is another great avenue for us to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe surge in grassroots activism inspired us to relaunch Film Your Issue, which was a landmark last decade in encouraging youth to engage in issues, and understand the power of their voice,\u201d says HeathCliff Rothman, President and Founder of Everyone Matters and Film Your Issue. \u201cIt is more important than ever to encourage youth engagement, advocacy and leadership, and let them know that leadership is listening to issues of direct concern to young people today. Issues transcend partisanship and affect us all as global citizens.\u201d\n\nThe original iteration of Film Your Issue, founded by HeathCliff Rothman, who also heads Everyone Matters, initially ran from 2005 to 2010, led by Honorary Distinguished Jurist Walter Cronkite, and whose jurists included Barack Obama, Tom Brokaw, Ben Bradlee, Nicholas Kristof, Judy Woodruff and others. 2018 participants include leaders from USA TODAY, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Smithsonian, The Kennedy Center, The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, The Globe and Mail, Google, Microsoft, The United Nations, U.S. Conference of Mayors, The Multifaith Alliance for Syrian Refugees, Girls Scouts, National PTA, The Obama Foundation.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FHdome", "description": "USA TODAY will serve as the media partner for the relaunch of the iconic Film Your Issue: Youth Speak Out, Leadership Listens Initiative in 2018.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
