Scientists compared the genomes of two woolly mammoths with those of Asian elephants - their closest living relatives - in an attempt to understand the differences between them. The research found that woolly mammoths and Asian elephants have nearly 1.4 million DNA letters difference between their genomes. These difference alter more than 1,600 genes, bringing about changes in skin and hair development, fat storage, metabolism and temperature sensation. One mammoth gene, known as TRPV3, was involved in sensitivity to the cold. It is thought these adaptations allowed the mammoth to survive in the freezing temperatures during the last ice age, but it is possible they left them ill equipped to cope as the climate warmed.\n\nThey discovered that unlike the isotopes found in woolly mammoths from the Ukrainian-Russian plains, who went locally extinct 15,000 years ago, and the mammoths of St. Paul Island in Alaska, who died out 5,600 years ago, the composition of Wrangel Island mammoths' collagen carbon and nitrogen isotopes did not change with the warming climate.\n\nThis suggests that they were not subject to a long-term disturbance in their diet and environment - a fact that has previously left scientists puzzled as to why the mammoths went extinct in what appear to have been favourable conditions.\n\nA change in the DNA of Wrangel Island mammoths was also observed by another study which found mutations in the way the animals metabolised fat.\n\nWhile Siberian mammoths had to rely on reserves of fat, Wrangel mammoths did not as they did not endure such harsh conditions as their predecessors.\n\nThe two populations showed differences in their carbonate carbon isotope values indicating a change in the fats and carbohydrates in the later population's diet.\n\nDr Laura Arppe from the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus, University of Helsinki, who led the team of researchers said: 'We think this reflects the tendency of Siberian mammoths to rely on their reserves of fat to survive through the extremely harsh ice age winters, while Wrangel mammoths, living in milder conditions, simply didn't need to.'\n\nMammoth tooth on the riverbank on Wrangel Island \u2013 scientists used these fossils to determine that mammoths there had survived longer than mainland individuals\n\nDrinking water for the Wrangel Island mammoths may have been affected by the break down of bedrock as higher levels of sulfur and strontium were found in the bones of later members of the population.\n\n\n\nWith no obvious conclusion as to why the mammals went extinct so quickly researchers can only theorise the short-term events that led to their demise.\n\nExtreme snow and ice leading to a lack of food and starvation is a likely scenario, say researchers.\n\nWinter sunrise on Wrangell island, Alaska (stock image)\n\nProfessor Herv\u00e9 Bocherens from the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution who co-wrote the study said: 'It's easy to imagine that the population, perhaps already weakened by genetic deterioration and drinking water quality issues could have succumbed after something like an extreme weather event.'\n\nHowever scientists say they have believe human contribution may have played a part.\n\nHuman bones dating just a few hundred years were found on on Wrangle island after the extinction of mammoths, meaning it is possible the spread of humans meant a decline in mammoth numbers leading to extinction.\n\nIsolated populations of large mammals are found to be particularly vulnerable to human behaviour and environmental factors by the study.", "description": "Extreme weather, poor drinking water, and possible hunting by humans may have caused the extinction of the last surviving mammoths who lived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19393634-0-image-a-11_1570449129046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
