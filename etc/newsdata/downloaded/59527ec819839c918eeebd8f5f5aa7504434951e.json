Now it's even blunter for the 2020 model year in available widebody form. One option conspicuously still not offered on this car, though, is subtlety.\n\nActually, everything about this car is conspicuous. It may be the first car to be visible, or possibly heard, from low Earth orbit. New fender flares add 3.3 inches of width to the Charger in order accommodate 11.0-inch wide, 20-inch diameter wheels wrapped with optional Pirelli P Zero PZ4 summer tires, sized 305/35R-20 at all four corners. (Similarly sized all-season rubber is standard.) It's essentially the same optional modification recently brought to the four-door Charger's two-door sibling, the Dodge Challenger, to create the Challenger widebody models.\n\nPhoto credit: Dodge More\n\nThe additional width emphasizes the Charger's inherent visual menace. This, after all, is a robust and athletic-looking machine even in base V-6\u00ad\u2013powered trim. With the updated car's nose configured around a new fascia with a revised grille opening, the effect is even more sinister. This is a car that looks like it's up to no good.\n\nA Wider Arsenal\n\nThe widebody Charger lineup starts with the Scat Pack model powered by a 391-cubic-inch, 6.4-liter Hemi under its hood. Rated at 485 horsepower, it is tractable and relatively easygoing in the way that only large displacement, naturally aspirated V-8s can be. The Charger's widebody package is a $6,000 option atop the regular Scat Pack's $41,490 base price, which still represents a significant value compared to similarly powered German hot-rod sedans. From there it's a step up to the Charger SRT Hellcat widebody with the now-familiar, 707-hp supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V-8. All 2020-model-year Charger SRT Hellcats will be widebodies, with prices starting at $71,140. That, on the surface, may seem like a lot for a Dodge, but it, too, is a pretty solid deal for that many horses. All Chargers continue to feature Fiat Chrysler's excellent, ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic transmission as standard.\n\nPhoto credit: Dodge More\n\nThere also will be Daytona 50thAnniversary edition versions of the 2020 Charger Hellcat, produced to celebrate the half-century since the original be-winged Charger Daytona made its debut on NASCAR racetracks. Software tweaks add an additional 10 horsepower to the supercharged V-8's output, now up to 717. But don't expect much in the way of a measurable performance boost; 10 ponies are but a 1-percent bump in output. Wearing its own color-keyed deck wing, Daytona stripe tail graphics, and a re-trimmed interior, the Daytona 50th Anniversary edition starts at $75,635, and only 501 will be produced, matching the number of original Charger Daytonas built in 1969.", "description": "The fat-tired widebody treatment gives Dodge's muscle sedan the presence and performance it's long needed.", "authors": ["John Pearley Huffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jAuFooieVIV08ugPysKn5Q--~B/aD03MTg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/e57a8d05bf4d41c17199d463e64eb2d9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
