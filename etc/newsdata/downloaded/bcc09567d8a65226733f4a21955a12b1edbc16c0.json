The precise circumstances surrounding his death were not clear.\n\n\u201cHis father has accepted his death, he just wants to know how it happened,\u201d relative Rahmat, who gave only his first name, told AFP in Kendari.\n\n\u201cBut his mother is still in shock.\u201d\n\nIt was the second fatality directly linked to days of street battles across the Southeast Asian nation that have left hundreds injured and sparked calls for a probe into allegations of police brutality.\n\nThis week\u2019s unrest was fuelled by a proposed bill that includes dozens of legal changes \u2014 from criminalising pre-marital sex and restricting sales of contraceptives, to making it illegal to insult the president and toughening the Muslim-majority country\u2019s blasphemy law.\n\nPassage of the reforms has now been delayed.\n\nThere has also been a backlash against a separate bill that critics fear would dilute the powers of Indonesia\u2019s corruption-fighting agency, including its ability to wire-tap graft suspects.\n\nThe demonstrations are among the biggest since mass street protests in 1998 brought down the three-decade Suharto dictatorship, and they come several weeks before re-elected president Joko Widodo is to kick off a second term.\n\nWidodo\u2019s administration has sought to portray the mass demonstrations as being hijacked by agitators aiming to disrupt government \u2014 and suggested they were similar to deadly post-election riots that paralysed Jakarta in May.\n\nOn Thursday, a 21-year-old university student in Kendari \u2014 where the local parliament building was torched \u2014 was rushed to hospital suffering from a chest wound and later died.\n\nQuestions have swirled around his death as police denied responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt was a gunshot wound, but I cannot confirm whether it was a live bullet or rubber bullet,\u201d said Kendari doctor Yudi Ashari, who treated the first victim.\n\nWhen asked by an AFP reporter if the first victim was killed by a live round, the forensic doctor who performed his autopsy answered \u201cyes\u201d several times on Friday.\n\nPolice have insisted that officers deployed to the Kendari riots were not equipped with live rounds or rubber bullets.", "description": "A second Indonesian student protester has died in demonstrations against a raft of divisive legal reforms, including banning pre-marital sex and weakening the anti-graft agency, sources said, as fresh unrest was expected Friday The 19-year-old...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://coconuts.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/000_1KN8AP.jpg"}
