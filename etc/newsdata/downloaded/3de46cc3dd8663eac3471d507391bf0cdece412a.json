Bayern are third in the table after eight games, having won only four of them and drawn three. They are only a point behind Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Wolfsburg.\n\nKovac, who recently oversaw a 7-2 win at Tottenham in the Champions League, is about to lose an ally at the club when Uli Hoeness steps down on 15 November and Bayern, who considered Rangnick as an option in the spring, may turn to the 61-year-old if there is not an upturn in results and performances.\n\nUnited are not as far down the line as Bayern with the club still backing Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to be a success but Rangnick is one of only a few options should the Norwegian lose his job. Rangnick, who is currently head of sport and development at Red Bull after spells as sporting director and coach at RB Leipzig, would prefer to work in the Premier League.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nRangnick has a reputation for transforming clubs by focusing on the player development area and said in a recent interview with the Guardian when asked about working at Old Trafford: \u201cI am happy where I am but if any club wanted to speak to me, the question would have to be: \u2018Can I be somebody who can influence areas of development across the whole club?\u2019 Otherwise you are only getting half of what I am capable of. If, after that, you can work together in a trustworthy and respectful way, then you are more likely to be successful.\u201d", "description": "Bayern are considering Ralf Rangnick as an option should performances not improve under Kovac with United also monitoring the situation", "authors": ["Marcus Christenson", "Christian Falk"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4309ac5021e1923da7f2f344097995c371a8c78/704_13_2296_1377/master/2296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=717e8963c10c23877d3a5ae43ffd8e2f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
