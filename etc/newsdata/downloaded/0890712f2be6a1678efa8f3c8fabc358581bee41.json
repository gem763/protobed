Women in South Africa were historically powerful and greatly respected. Men couldn\u2019t go to war or pick up a spear without the permission of their wives. Women were considered the spiritual superior to men and even the most autocratic kings consulted females in their community before making important decisions. This isn\u2019t taught in schools.\n\nEducation is fundamental to improving the future for black people because you have to know who you are to know where you\u2019re going. I\u2019ve had the resources and mentors to re-educate myself as an adult, so I finally understand my identity. I have felt the pain of rejection. The pain of being silenced and the pain of being let down \u2013 these feelings made me realise who I am and I found my truth, which is why I now feel capable of sharing it.\n\nBecause history books are written from a majority white perspective, children grow up with no knowledge of black people\u2019s history before slavery and apartheid. I wish teachers had taught me that the richest person in history was a black emperor named Mansa Musa. We have a rich heritage, we were industrious, we built cities, we created economies. I was shocked to see so many artefacts in the London Museum carrying the staggering history of South Africa before the colonial period, considering the British pillaged the land and erased our identity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

For example, 90 per cent of music played on the radio has to be by local artists. So I was surprised to learn that, until two years ago, London authorities could ban artists from sharing their craft based on the ethnicity of their fans, thanks to Form 696. And that, while Notting Hill Carnival is supposed to be a celebration of black culture, it is still measured based on the level of crime that takes place there. It seems that misinformation continues to fuel a negative portrayal of black culture.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Since educating and accepting myself, I make sure I spend the same amount of energy understanding, nurturing and celebrating my identity. Not only has this positively impacted my mental health, but it\u2019s freed me creatively which is what I\u2019m conveying in \u201cFunani\u201d. Be yourself. Afro-Rave is a sound which finally, authentically reflects my beautifully complex being, such as mixing the sounds of Southern Africa and grimey UK garage beats. It\u2019s my biography in musical form.\n\nBlack History Month is an opportunity to educate everyone, regardless of their race. We must unapologetically, relentlessly champion black culture and expose systematic discrimination. We are in this together.\n\nToya Delazy is a multi-award winning artist and an ambassador for Unicef.
