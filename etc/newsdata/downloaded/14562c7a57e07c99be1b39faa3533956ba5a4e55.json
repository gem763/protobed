Cedar Fair shares were trading at around $58 right before Reuters broke news of Six Flags\u2019 bid on Wednesday.\n\nCedar Fair responded that Six Flags\u2019 bid was too low, not least because it did not compensate Cedar Fair shareholders for giving up on the company\u2019s tax-advantageous publicly traded partnership. This allows the company to pay out the majority of its earnings to shareholders without first paying U.S. federal or state income taxes.\n\nSix Flags Chief Executive James Reid-Anderson is preparing to retire by the end of February, and the company had offered Cedar Fair executives roles in the management of the combined company, though this was not enough to persuade them, the sources added.\n\nReactions from stock market investors, as well as amusement park fans concerned about the impact of the potential deal on how Cedar Fair parks will be run, have been negative, and there is no indication that Six Flags will counter with a new offer, the sources said.\n\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Cedar Fair and Six Flags did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBased in Grand Prairie, Texas, Six Flags has 26 parks across the United States, Mexico and Canada. Headquartered in Sandusky, Ohio, Cedar Fair owns and operates 11 amusement parks, four outdoor water parks and an indoor water park in several U.S. states and in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nDealmaking in the leisure and entertainment sector has been heating up. Earlier this week, private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N) said it had agreed to acquire a 65% stake in U.S. resort operator Great Wolf Resorts Inc in a $2.9 billion deal. Great Wolf\u2019s owner, Centerbridge Partners LP, will remain an investor in the company.", "description": "U.S. amusement park operator Cedar Fair LP has rejected a $4 billion cash-and-stock offer from larger peer Six Flags Entertainment Corp as inadequate, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.", "authors": ["Greg Roumeliotis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
