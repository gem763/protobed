This is a significant problem that has been overlooked for too long.\n\nCalifornia has one of the most expansive sanctuary state laws in the nation. As Breitbart News has reported, California law enforcement officials have refused to turn at least 5,600 criminal illegal aliens over to ICE agents for arrest and deportation. Instead, these illegal aliens were released back into communities.\n\nIn one case last year, a 47-year-old illegal alien from El Salvador sought sanctuary in California after being deported from the U.S. six times. In September 2018, the illegal alien was charged with murdering three men \u2014 including 39-year-old Steven Cruze Jr. \u2014 by beating them to death with a baseball bat.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
