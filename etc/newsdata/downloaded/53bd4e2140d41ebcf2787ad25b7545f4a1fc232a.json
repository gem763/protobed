REUTERS/Gary He/File Photo\n\nThe so-called MCAS system, which relied on one sensor, has been linked in part to crashes of 737 MAX jets flown by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, which triggered a worldwide grounding and a corporate crisis at the world\u2019s largest planemaker.\n\nThe potential redesign discussed during 737 MAX development was ultimately ruled out, based in part on the assumption pilots would react in time to any malfunction, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report to Indonesian investigators.\n\nAlthough not formally part of the required analysis, the Boeing staff discussed the scenario of repeated activation of MCAS due to erroneously high Angle-of-Attack data and considered whether a redesign was necessary, the NTSB report said, citing a 2019 presentation by Boeing to the agency.\n\n\u201cAs part of this discussion they discussed the combined flight deck effects ... but determined that no redesign was necessary,\u201d the NTSB said of the Boeing discussion, referring to alerts that could be potentially distracting to pilots.\n\nLater, in a review after the Lion Air 737 MAX crash last October which killed all 189 people on board, Boeing also found that presenting the scenario to regulators would not have led it to classify the anti-stall system as a bigger hazard at the time.\n\nBoeing has redesigned the system to rely on more than one sensor and help reduce pilot workload as it strives to return the model to the air.\n\nThe fresh details of the design of the MCAS system from the NTSB are included in a final report by Indonesian officials into the Lion Air crash. The NTSB has been supporting the Indonesian-led probe.\n\nReuters obtained a copy of the overall report, due to be released publicly later on Friday or on Saturday.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Boeing said it had redesigned the system so MCAS would in future compare information from both Angle-of-Attack sensors before activating and would be easier for pilots to over-ride.\n\n\u201cThese software changes will prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again,\u201d it said, declining further comment.\n\nRELATIVELY SIMPLE\n\nBoeing had assumed pilots would recognise the plane\u2019s uncommanded nose-down movement within the three seconds required by regulators, making it relatively simple to restore the aircraft to a normal position, according to the final report.\n\nThe manufacturer did not consider what would happen if a pilot reacted more slowly, leaving MCAS able to move the nose down by the system\u2019s maximum allowable amount. In the Lion Air crash, it took the pilot 11 seconds to respond to the first movement, during which the system reached the maximum authority.\n\nIndonesian authorities recommended Boeing make more allowance in the design of its jets for the reactions of normal pilots, rather than its exceptionally skilled test pilots.\n\nBoeing, which did not describe the MCAS system in pilot manuals, thought pilots would quickly perform a checklist to deal with a problem called \u201crunaway stabilizer\u201d, for which they were already trained and which resembled the impact of MCAS.\n\nHowever, the report found that MCAS did not behave in the same manner as a typical runaway, as the movement was not continuous and pilots were able to counter it multiple times by pulling back on their control columns.\n\nAt the same time as the aircraft was moving nose-down, making it difficult to control, the pilots were faced with a cascade of alerts as they tried to diagnose the situation.\n\n\u201cThe flight crew were running out of time to find a solution before the repetitive MCAS activations placed the aircraft in an extreme nose-down attitude that they were unable to recover from,\u201d the report said.", "description": "Boeing engineers and test pilots considered before two fatal 737 MAX crashes whether an anti-stall system should be redesigned after discussing how flawed data from a single sensor could trigger it repeatedly, U.S. investigators have found.", "authors": ["Jamie Freed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444911162&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1CF", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
