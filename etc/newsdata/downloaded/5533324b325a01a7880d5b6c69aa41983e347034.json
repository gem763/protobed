And there\u2019s even a Hillary Clinton angle.\n\nThe Weinstein and Lauer sagas are, bizarrely, connected, according to the forthcoming book \u201cCatch and Kill: Lies, Spies and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators.\u201d\n\nWHY CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS AND POLS ARE DENOUNCING TRUMP\u2019S SYRIA MOVE\n\nNBC drew substantial criticism for refusing to publish Farrow\u2019s allegations against Weinstein \u2014 the network claimed the story lacked sufficient proof \u2014 before he took the story to the New Yorker and, with more reporting, won a Pulitzer for his work.\n\nLauer was fired, in late 2017, during the #MeToo movement triggered by Weinstein.\n\nFarrow writes, according to the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cWeinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer\u2019s behavior and capable of revealing it.\u201d Citing unnamed sources at NBC and tabloid company American Media, Farrow says Weinstein was using dirt unearthed by the National Enquirer on the \u201cToday\u201d co-host to pressure NBC executives to kill the Farrow expose.\n\nAccording to Farrow, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told Weinstein lawyer David Boies: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve told Harvey we\u2019re not doing a story. If we decide to do a story, we\u2019ll tell him.\u2019 Weinstein was ecstatic, boasting in his offices that he would also quash the rumored [New York] Times piece: \u2018If I can get a network to kill a story, how hard can a newspaper be?\u2019\u201d\n\nLater, Weinstein emailed NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, who responded: \u2018Thanks Harvey, appreciate the well-wishes!\u2019 Weinstein then sent Oppenheim a bottle of Grey Goose vodka.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s this fascinating tidbit, with the backdrop that Weinstein was a big donor to Hillary and other Democrats. Farrow, who had worked for Clinton at the State Department, was also trying to land an interview with her for a foreign policy book.\n\nClinton\u2019s spokesman, Nick Merrill, called him to say that the \u201cbig story\u201d Farrow was working on was \u201ca concern for us,\u201d the book explains. That is, to say the least, disturbing.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nWeinstein, meanwhile, emailed another NBC executive, Deborah Turness, to propose a Hillary documentary for NBC. \u201cYour Hillary doc sounds absolutely stunning,\u201d she replied.\n\n(Not so cooperative was Farrow\u2019s estranged father. When Weinstein called Woody Allen for advice on dealing with his son, the director declined: \u201cJeez. I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck.\u201d\n\nNow to the Lauer mess.\n\nA previously anonymous accuser, Brooke Nevils, goes public with Farrow, alleging that Lauer raped her in his hotel room at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, after she\u2019d had six shots.\n\nIn passages quoted by Variety, Nevils says Lauer \u201cpushed her against the door and kissed her. He then pushed her onto the bed, \u2018flipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex.\u2019 \u201cShe said that she declined several times,\u201d and \u201cwept silently into a pillow\u201d as he did it.\n\nNevils says: \u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nLauer, who I\u2019ve interviewed many times over the years, is vehemently disputing Nevils\u2019 account:\n\n\u201cIt is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d\n\nHe says the extramarital affair that began in Sochi was \u201cthe first of many sexual encounters between us over the next several months.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry. She was a fully enthusiastic and willing partner,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cAt no time did she behave in a way that made it appear she was incapable of consent. She seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do. The only concern she expressed was that someone might see her leaving my room. She embraced me at the door as she left.\u201d\n\nFinally, Lauer alleges that Nevils once shopped a book deal and is now \u201cmaking outrageous and false accusations to help sell a different book and stepping into the spotlight to cause as much damage as she can.\u201d\n\nAfter saying virtually nothing for nearly two years, Lauer now says \u201cmy silence has been a mistake.\u201d\n\nNBC, for its part, said in a statement that Lauer\u2019s conduct was \u201cappalling, horrific and reprehensible,\u201d and that\u2019s why he was fired 24 hours after Nevils\u2019 accusation. \u201cOur hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nIn a memo to colleagues, Lack also said that Farrow paints \"a fundamentally untrue picture\" of NBC's handling of his Weinstein reporting.\n\n\"After seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn't have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any other major news organization,\" Lack wrote, adding that Farrow's New Yorker piece \"bore little resemblance\" to what he had at NBC.\n\nOn \u201cToday,\u201d Savannah Guthrie called the accusations \u201cshocking\u201d and added: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it.\u201d\n\nAs serious as these allegations are, the Lauer battle is largely over, as he\u2019s gone from network television. But NBC is gearing up for a major battle as Farrow prepares the make the rounds on his book, which portrays the network as caving to pressure from a man now regarded as a monster.", "description": "The latest accusation against Matt Lauer is making huge headlines, but an equally big shocker is how NBC handled the Harvey Weinstein story.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/09/694940094001_6093533260001_6093528942001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
