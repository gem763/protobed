This lets you read along with media playing on sources like YouTube, Twitter, and more.\n\nAs Android Police recently discovered, audio transcriptions even work when your Pixel 4's volume is turned down\u2014or an app is muted. This is because live transcriptions are created from audio data, and not from sounds picked up by the phone\u2019s microphone. If you prefer to mute autoplaying videos (or if your browser doesn\u2019t mute them by default), but don\u2019t want to miss the important information you might get from an occasional video, this combination of muting and Live Caption is for you.\n\nTo turn on your Pixel 4's live captioning, go to Settings > Sound > Live Caption, and then tap the slider to toggle the feature on. Your phone will automatically notify you and start captioning when it recognises internal audio is being played.\n\nThis is a great accessibility option for those with hearing impairments, but all users will benefit from live captioning\u2014including Pixel 3 and 3a users, who will receive the feature in an upcoming update. As for the muting aspect, that part\u2019s easy: just turn your phone\u2019s volume all the way down when you\u2019re using your web browser. You could also keep it cranked and tap on the lock icon to the right of Chrome\u2019s address bar (for example), tap on Site settings, and block sound across an entire domain.", "description": "One of the coolest  parts of Google\u2019s Pixel 4 is its AI-assisted Live Caption feature, which allows your smartphone to automatically caption any audio being played in your apps.
