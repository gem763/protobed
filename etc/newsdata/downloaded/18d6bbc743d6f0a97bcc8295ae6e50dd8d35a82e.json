The tune, which has been performed by Dean Martin, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and even Will Ferrell and Zoey Deschanel in \"Elf\" has become a Christmas staple -- even though there are zero references to the season, and nothing is even vaguely sacred about the ditty.\n\nBroadway composer Frank Loesser wrote the tune in 1944 as a duet to perform with his wife at parties. It is a wintry, romantic sparring set to music. And while generations of music fans saw it as a flirty song about two people trying to find an excuse to spend the night together, some contemporary listeners hear only a \u201cdate rape\u201d song.\n\nThese lyrics are the ones often cited as offensive:\n\n'BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE' CHRISTMAS SONG CONTROVERSY ISN'T NEW: A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LYRICS DEBATE\n\nThe neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)\n\nSay what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)\n\nNow the lady in the song might simply be inquiring about the ingredients of her cocktail. But in the wake of the Bill Cosby drugging scandal, listeners imagined the male character as a predator and demanded that the song be pulled from radio playlists during Christmas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFrank Loesser\u2019s daughter, Susan, told NBC News last year that her father wouldn't appreciate the radio stations that have banned his song. \"I think my father would be furious at that. People used to say 'what\u2019s in this drink' as a joke. You know, this drink is going straight to my head so what\u2019s in this drink? Back then it didn\u2019t mean you drugged me.\"\n\nNo matter. Enter John Legend to clean up and repair Frank Loesser for a new generation with a \u201cnewfound sensitivity\u201d (according to a gushing Vanity Fair cover story). On his soon to be released Christmas album, he and Kelly Clarkson sing Legend\u2019s #MeTooed lyrics, changing the following from the original:\n\nI really can't stay (But baby it's cold outside)\n\nI've got to away (But baby it's cold outside)\n\nTo this:\n\nI really can\u2019t stay (Baby it\u2019s cold outside)\n\nI\u2019ve gotta go away (I can call you a ride)\n\nAnd the original song's:\n\nMy mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what\u2019s your hurry)\n\nThe neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)\n\nSay what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)\n\nHave become in the Legend rewrite:\n\nMy mother will start to worry (I\u2019ll call a car and tell \u2019em to hurry)\n\nWhat will my friends think (I think they should rejoice)\n\nIf I have one more drink? (It\u2019s your body and your choice)\n\nNot only do the rewrites totally cut against the character\u2019s intentions and the whole thrust of the song, but they\u2019re also clunky and out of meter. (And isn\u2019t the word \"baby\" derogatory?) Whatever the case, the Loesser estate should sue for disfigurement of a classic. Unfortunately, the song, this year, fell out of copyright and entered the public domain.\n\nAs for Legend\u2019s heavy-handed attempt to protect women with his lyrics, one wishes he were equally as respectful with his words. The same Vanity Fair article that reported the song rewrite described Legend commenting on first lady Melania Trump: \"'Hasn\u2019t Melania opened the door for anyone to be a first lady?' says Legend, with his low chuckle. 'The biggest issue about this presidency is how they\u2019ve just lowered standards for everything.'\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThank goodness Legend has come along to raise the standards for rewriting classic songs. One only hopes he doesn\u2019t discover other Frank Loesser tunes to maim with his politically correct pen. Those include \"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,\" \"Standing on the Corner Watching All The Girls Go By,\" and the \"Guys and Dolls\" classic: \"Sue me, sue me, shoot bullets through me, I love you.\"\n\nSong lyrics should be evaluated and performed sensitive to the era of their creation, not distorted through the lens of contemporary political correctness or morays. And if Legend finds Loesser\u2019s lyrics are so offensive, why not cast them aside and write all original Christmas songs for his upcoming album? We\u2019ll see if they attract audiences, or have any of the \"heart and soul\" or staying power of Loesser\u2019s canon.", "description": "This Christmas, John Legend is draining the romance and edge from a Christmas chestnut.", "authors": ["Raymond Arroyo", "Raymond Arroyo Is A Fox News Contributor", "Author Of", "Will Wilder", "The Amulet Of Power", "Random House Crown", "Publishing February"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/John-Legend-REUTERS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
