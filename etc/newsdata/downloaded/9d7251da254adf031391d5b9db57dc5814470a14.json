Awake for the procedure, Schardt spoke throughout the process, smiling and helping doctors map her brain by answering their questions.\n\nThe procedure was narrated by a spokesman for the hospital alongside its chief of neurosurgery, Dr Nimesh Patel. Patel said when Schardt was approached by the hospital about the idea, she \u201cwas eager to have us broadcast this\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe struggled with the idea of doing a Facebook Live brain surgery, but because Jenna was so forthcoming and she wanted to show the rest of the community if you have this problem you can fix it, she was a role model for us and we supported her because of that,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors were removing a mass that had been affecting Schardt\u2019s speech and could have caused seizures.\n\nSchardt\u2019s neurological issues began while she was studying to become an occupational therapist. One day at work, she suddenly lost her ability to speak. After she was rushed to a local hospital, a mass of blood vessels was found in her brain.\n\nLike many brain surgeries, the procedure was done while Schardt remained awake so surgeons could test brain function in the area surrounding the lesion they were removing, in order to avoid harming her cognitive abilities.\n\nWhen removing the mass, cutting just one millimeter to the left or the right could affect her speech or other abilities, so Schardt looked at a screen shown to her by a medical technician and identified various numbers, colors, and animals to ensure she could maintain brain function throughout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so impressed with how she is handling this,\u201d Patel said during the stream.\n\nWhile the brain surgery appears to be the first of its kind to be streamed, broadcasting medical procedures is becoming increasingly common. In 2018, a Texas woman allowed her breast cancer surgery to be streamed live on Facebook to raise awareness about the disease, and a police officer in Texas streamed his lung surgery on the platform. Michael Salzhauer, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Florida, has gained thousands of followers and a number of new patients from streaming surgeries on Instagram and Snapchat.\n\nThe video of Schardt\u2019s surgery had more than 45,000 views and 1,000 comments by the time it ended. The hospital said it did not show the bloody details of the surgery because it did not think Facebook would allow it. Instead it showed Schardt\u2019s head surrounded by blue sheets while two doctors worked behind them.\n\nMany people tuning in thanked Schardt and the doctors for allowing them to watch the procedure. Others asked questions about what kind of anesthetic was used and how long her recovery time would be.\n\n\u201cWatching this surgery has given me hope about my future similar left temporal lobe surgery,\u201d one viewer wrote.\n\n\u201cI have the same mass of blood vessels but mine is on my brainstem and I tuned in because I want to get at least a little bit of an idea of what this surgery is like,\u201d another said.\n\nThe doctor described the procedure as \u201cclose to perfection\u201d as the stream came to an end and doctors prepared to reattach her skull. Schardt will recover in the hospital before being released in several days.", "description": "Jenna Schardt was awake during procedure at Texas hospital as she helped doctors map her brain by answering their questions", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9256f17291fbef740d1e787cd6880ab4445f427/21_0_622_373/master/622.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fefaee2179a917782e56253580a98df1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
