Alliance defence ministers would be keen to discuss the matter when they meet in Brussels next week, he says.\n\n\u2013 No expulsion mechanism \u2013\n\nUS Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said he will use the meeting to press allies to take \u201ccollective and individual diplomatic and economic measures\u201d to punish Turkey for its \u201cegregious\u201d actions.\n\nBut calls from some quarters for Turkey to be suspended or even kicked out of NATO will lead nowhere, experts say, because no such mechanism exists in the alliance.\n\n\u201cNATO is limited by what it can do formally to punish Turkey because all NATO decisions have to be made unanimously, thus Turkey can block any decisions that criticise or sanction it,\u201d Jorge Benitez, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told AFP.\n\nEven if it were practically possible, it is doubtful whether on balance NATO allies would want to eject Turkey, given its vital strategic location on the edge of the Middle East, bordering Iran and across the Black Sea from Russia \u2014 and given Erdogan\u2019s recent drift towards Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\n\u201cBut the other allies can still punish Turkey by individually withholding information from Ankara and choosing to informally meet together without Turkey at the table,\u201d Benitez added.\n\nOff-the-book measures of this sort were taken privately against Portugal at NATO following a coup in 1974, Benitez said, while the US imposed a three-year arms embargo on Turkey following its intervention in Cyprus the same year.\n\nEuropean countries including Germany, France, Britain and the Netherlands have announced they will suspend new arms sales to Turkey in response to the Syria operation.\n\nBut there are already doubts about how much practical effect this will have. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn has pointed out that \u201cErdogan is not waiting for Europe to provide him with weapons\u201d.\n\nSome observers have suggested that if Europe is serious about putting pressure on Erdogan, a more effective tactic would be to tell citizens not to take holidays in Turkey, hitting the country\u2019s vital tourism industry.\n\n\u2013 Russian orbit \u2013\n\nBut with Erdogan already seemingly disengaging with the West and drifting ever closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin, NATO countries will want to balance their desire to take a stand over Syria with Turkey\u2019s longer-term value to the alliance.\n\n\u201cOn balance it\u2019s still better to have Turkey as a nominal ally than as a potential adversary, probably teaming up with Russia \u2014 that\u2019s the unpalatable situation that NATO finds itself in now,\u201d Elisabeth Braw, a senior research fellow at the RUSI think tank in London, told AFP.\n\nAs a military alliance with a clear mission \u2014 the defence of its members\u2019 territory \u2014 rather than a political project like the EU, NATO can take a more pragmatic, hard-headed view of crises like the present one, Braw said.\n\n\u201cThroughout its history NATO has had to put up with a lot of unattractive behaviour by its different member states and has still remained this successful military alliance,\u201d she said.\n\nBut with NATO already struggling with internal divisions \u2014 not least Trump\u2019s repeated goading of allies for not living up to defence spending commitments \u2014 the latest crisis sets the stage for a dramatic summit in London in December.", "description": "Turkey's Syria offensive has created fresh divisions within NATO as the crisis adds to pressures on the alliance", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/army-turkey-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
