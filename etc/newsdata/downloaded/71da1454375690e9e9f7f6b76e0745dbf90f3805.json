The OSC report called Conway a \u201crepeat offender\u201d who shows \u201cdisregard for the law\u201d by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates in her White House role on TV and in social media.\n\nBut President Donald Trump refused to take action. Instead, the White House pressured OSC to retract the recommendation to fire Conway. Special Counsel Henry Kerner, a Trump appointee, responded that such a request was \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d and argued that allowing Conway to continue to violate the Hatch Act \u201cerodes\u201d the rule of law.", "description": "", "authors": ["Huffpost.Com Entry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
