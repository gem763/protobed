He bloodied Kadestam (12-5) and produced a well-rounded effort to take the title in the main event bout, which took place at Istora Senayan in Jakarta, Indonesia, and streamed on B/R Live.\n\nAbbasov did what challengers are meant to do in a title fight by coming out of the gate strong. He had some good moments in the first round, including a near-submission attempt that could\u2019ve ended the bout quickly.\n\nKadestam showed his champions spirit, though, and got himself back into the fight in the second round. He put in a hard effort to sap away Abbasov\u2019s energy, who looked like he was starting to fatigue badly going into the second half of the fight.\n\nAbbasov found his second win, though, and tuned up the volume in the latter rounds. He worked over Kadestam in the striking and grappling, even opening some cuts on the face of his opponent to make the fight even more definitive in his favor.\n\nWhen 25 minutes were complete it was obvious Abbasov had won. The judges agreed and the Kyrgyzstan-born fighter left with the gold after his 14th win his past 15 fights.\n\nJohn Lineker edges out win in debut\n\nOne of the most consistently entertaining fighters in MMA made his ONE Championship debut in successful fashion when John Lineker completed his crossover from the UFC with a unanimous decision victory over Muin Gafurov.\n\nLineker (32-9), who was among the top contenders at bantamweight and flyweight during his 16-fight UFC tenure, was able to put his aggressive pressure game and borderline recklessness to good use as he outworked Gafurov (16-3) over the course of three rounds.\n\nThe first round of the fight was big for the Brazilian, because he managed to hurt Gafurov to the body and deliver effective offense. Lineker somewhat slowed as the second and third rounds came, and that\u2019s when Gafurov got himself back in it and made the fight highly competitive. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to take the win away from Lineker.\n\nDespite nine wins in his final 10 UFC fights, Lineker split from the promotion. He seems to have landed well on his feet, though, because he got off to a solid start with his new home at ONE Championship.\n\nComplete ONE Championship 101 results included:\n\nKiamrian Abbasov def.
