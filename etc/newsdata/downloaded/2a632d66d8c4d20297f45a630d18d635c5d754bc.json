But tonight we all got the job done, we got the stick around.\n\n\u201cI take my hat off to my team-mates, for being brave, and not feeling that stigma of Team USA always dropping the stick, or not finishing, or something always happening or going wrong.\n\n\u201cThey broke that curse tonight. And I\u2019m grateful for these guys to give me that gift tonight.\u201d\n\nThe USA victory came after they were given an almighty scare in Friday\u2019s semi-finals, when they came within a whisker of disqualification after a botched final handover.\n\nA Canadian appeal against the USA\u2019s inclusion in the final was dismissed.\n\nGatlin, the 2017 world champion, said the relay squad had met earlier Saturday to discuss the race.\n\n\u201cWe are a brotherhood,\u201d said Gatlin. \u201cWe had a talk this morning and we said we are going to go out there and do this.\u201d\n\nVeteran Michael Rodgers said they had been motivated by one thing.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do this for Justin.\u201d\n\nDefending champions Britain took silver as Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake ran a superb anchor leg to overhaul Japan\u2019s Abdul Hakim Sani Brown.\n\nBoth the British and the Japanese set new European and Asian records with times of 37.36sec and 37.43sec respectively.", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Justin Gatlin celebrated his first relay gold medal on Saturday as the United States lifted their 4 x 100 metres curse with victory at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/d04fbb_justin-gatlin-finally-got-his-global-4x100-metres-relay-gold-as-united-states-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
