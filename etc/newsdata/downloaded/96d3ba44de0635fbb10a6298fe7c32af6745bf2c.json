Getty Images 6/21 Neal Maupay (Brighton & Hove Albion) Brighton's \u00a316m summer signing is still working to consolidate his place in Graham Potter's preferred starting XI. A goal against Burnley on Saturday would certainly help his cause. CameraSport via Getty Images 7/21 Lewis Cook (Bournemouth) The midfielder is yet to feature this season as he continues his comeback from knee ligament damage. But he did play sixty minutes for the club in a behind-closed-doors friendly against QPR and could yet make the first-team squad this weekend. AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images 8/21 Matty Longstaff (Newcastle United) Newcastle have something of an injury crisis on their hands for their trip to Liverpool, with as many as seven first-team players absent. An injury to Sean Longstaff could meanwhile see his younger brother, Matty, make Steve Bruce's travelling squad. Getty Images 9/21 Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Southampton) All eyes will be on the 24-year-old this weekend after he was challenged by manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to sign a new Southampton contract. \u201cWe are always in contact with his agent and Pierre knows about his important role for this club,\" the Southampton boss said. Getty Images 10/21 Ashley Barnes (Burnley) Ashley Barnes is up against his former club, Brighton, this weekend, having made a strong start to the new season. He has scored four goals in four appearances for Burnley. CameraSport via Getty Images 11/21 Willian (Chelsea) Willian is yet to start a competitive match under Frank Lampard but is in line to start against Wolves on Saturday. Chelsea desperate need him to hit the ground running, which will be difficult considering his lack of pre-season. Getty 12/21 Lys Mousset (Sheffield United) There are question marks over the fitness of David McGoldrick and Callum Robinson, who were both withdrawn from international duty recently, meaning Lys Mousset could be handed a start. REUTERS 13/21 Christian Eriksen (Tottenham Hotspur) Christian Eriksen failed to secure a move away from Spurs ahead of the European transfer deadline and will stay on in north London, although he has yet to sign a new deal with the club. \"He never said he was not happy here - he always was,\" Mauricio Pochettino said this weekend. \"I said before the Arsenal game that he was in the right mind - that's why I selected him for that game and I will continue to select him. He has always been such an important player for us and he will continue to be.\" Getty Images 14/21 Juan Mata (Manchester United) Manchester United's injury crisis means that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is likely to turn to the 31-year-old for the visit of Leicester City this weekend. Getty Images 15/21 Manuel Lanzini (West Ham United) Manuel Lanzini is set to start for West Ham against Aston Villa - although only rejoined his team-mates on Friday, having undertaken a 10,000-mile round trip to make a 13-minute substitute appearance for Argentina in their 4-0 win against Mexico in Texas on Wednesday. West Ham United FC via Getty Ima 16/21 Michael Keane (Everton) Michael Keane is another player who will hope to shrug off the international break when he returns to domestic duty this weekend.

He will hope to continue his scoring streak when Palace play Spurs, and given Tottenham's recent form, will surely find himself with ample opportunities on the counter-attack. Getty Images 19/21 James Maddison (Manchester United) Manchester United sniffed around James Maddison this summer, ultimately deciding against bidding for the 22-year-old. But the speculation has persisted and all eyes will be on the midfielder at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.
