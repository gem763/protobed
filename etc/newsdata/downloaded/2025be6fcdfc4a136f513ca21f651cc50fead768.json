We are using equity funding to support business, and it is important that we are investing in local entrepreneurs,\" she said.\n\nIn June, Naspers Foundry announced a R30m investment in SweepSouth, a tech start-up which provides cleaning services. Mahanyele-Dabengwa hailed the online service, which was co-founded in 2014 by Aisha Pandor and Alen Ribicas, as a solution not only applicable in South Africa but also the rest of the world.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk emphasised the media and e-commerce group's commitment to South Africa, following the listing of new company Prosus on the Euronext bourse in Amsterdam. Prosus now owns all of Naspers\u2019 international internet assets.\n\nVan Dijk described the move as necessary for growth.\n\n* Fin24 is part of 24.com, a division of Media24, which is a subsidiary of Naspers", "description": "Naspers Foundry is set to unveil new investments before the end of the year, in what is a drive to support entrepreneurs in the local tech sector,", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3953/6ef4ce3de2ec42cebac74c0cfedde234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
