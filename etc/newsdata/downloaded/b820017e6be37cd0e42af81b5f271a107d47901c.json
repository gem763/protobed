I\u2019m a longtime comic book reader, and since Wednesdays are when new comics come out, I\u2019m always a little excited \u2014 but this has been different. There\u2019s something special going on in the world of X-Men comics, and I need to tell you about it.\n\nHouse of X and Powers of X are two intertwining miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman, with art by Pepe Larraz and R.B Silva, respectively. Over the last eleven weeks, the two series have taken turns telling complimentary stories establishing a brand-new status quo for the X-Men, each issue complicating the others and hinting at audacious new developments.\n\nHouse of X just ended this week with its sixth issue, and Powers of X No. 6 will end this whole prelude, kicking off a new line of X-Men books under a banner called Dawn of X. Describing it logistically like that makes it sound like any old comics event, and in some ways, it is \u2014 only the story being told here is incredible and feels relevant in a way the X-Men haven\u2019t felt in ages.\n\n(Light spoilers only.)\n\nIn House of X/Powers of X (often abbreviated HoX/PoX), Charles Xavier, leader of the X-Men, realises his dream of human/mutant coexistence just hasn\u2019t been working out. Mankind has not accepted mutants, no matter how much mutants work to save them. So he tries something new. Working with his best frenemy Magneto, Xavier unites all mutants around the world, inviting them to the living island of Krakoa and declaring it a sovereign nation where mutants can find sanctuary and amnesty. That includes villains, like Apocalypse.\n\nThe actual mechanics of how this is all pulled off are dazzling, with some of the most audacious retcons and twists I\u2019ve read in a superhero comic. They\u2019re best discovered as you read, and I won\u2019t spoil them here. I\u2019m more interested in talking about how the HoX/PoX comics make the X-Men feel vital again.\n\nImage: Marvel Comics\n\nOne of the most important things about X-Men, and X-Men stories, is the mutant metaphor. Initially understood to be a stand-in for the Civil Rights struggle in America, mutants were hated and feared, constantly oppressed for being born different even as they fought for humanity.\n\nOver time, mutantkind has been a comic book stand-in for all sorts of marginalised people \u2014 stories have both implicitly and explicitly drawn connections to queer experiences (consider Iceman \u201ccoming out\u201d as a mutant in the film X2, or literally coming out as queer in recent comics), or Jewish ones (Like this Brian Michael Bendis-written speech from Kitty Pryde).\n\nSometimes, the malleability of this metaphor is a weakness. If you take it seriously as a text on race, for example, it starts to fall apart, ill-equipped to engage with ideas like institutional discrimination because it needs to be a superhero story first. In a lot of ways, most X-Men stories just let you decide who the X-Men stand for, and that\u2019s worked pretty well in broad strokes even if it fails when you dig deep.\n\nHoX/PoX both sidesteps and amplifies the metaphor by fundamentally shifting the fantasy of the X-Men: What if marginalised people \u2014 queer people, people of colour, Jewish people \u2014 didn\u2019t have to appeal to those in power? What if they could, overnight, declare themselves a power in their own right and demand the respect they should\u2019ve gotten from the start? What if they were free to build a culture without the meddling of colonists, the rich, the powerful?\n\nTo the marginalised, it would be incredible. To the rest of the world, it would be uncomfortable. Terrifying, even. And that\u2019s my favourite trick in HoX/PoX \u2014 the books make you complicit in that unease. It is not comfortable to watch mutants declare themselves sovereign and build a society. Something about it feels wrong. Dangerous. Radical.\n\nPerhaps that discomfort stems from living in a world that labors so hard to keep power where it is, and the marginalised in line. Perhaps it\u2019s because this world has decided that its rules are not supposed to be written by queer leaders or people of colour.\n\nIt\u2019s apt that the central metaphor of the X-Men, mutation, is something that\u2019s driven by evolution. It is inevitable. You cannot stop it. For decades, the X-Men were heroes to readers who felt different, or cast out, for a multitude of reasons. X-Men comics, while not perfect, strove to represent those people in their stories: It was a team with a roster from all over the world, with people who looked \u201cnormal\u201d and people who did not.\n\nHoX/PoX takes that metaphor and refuses to make it palatable. It is bold and uncompromising. It looks at the marginalised people its characters have long stood in for and says they are inevitable. That they cannot be stopped.", "description": "For the past 11 weeks, I have eagerly awaited Wednesday mornings in a way I haven\u2019t in a very long time.
