Louie Douvis\n\nBut there\u2019s a sharper edge behind the predictably polite welcoming rhetoric from Canberra. Long-standing BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott is actually pretty popular with the Morrison government given her willingness to argue her case anywhere and everywhere in a down-to-earth fashion.\n\nBut the Morrison government has still been critical of much of big business for focusing more on fashionable social issues beyond their core responsibilities to customers and shareholders.\n\nThis view was bluntly expressed by Ben Morton, assistant minister to the Prime Minister and a close personal ally.\n\n\u201cToo often big businesses have been in the frontline on social issues, but missing in action when arguing for policies which would grow jobs and the economy,\" he said.\n\nOvercoming the tensions\n\nThe common example cited by Liberal politicians is the failure of corporate Australia to come out in sufficient force to generate support for the government\u2019s now abandoned corporate tax cuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch criticism has to make an exception for Westacott\u2019s strong advocacy for tax cuts. It\u2019s also dubious how much impact individual bank chief executives, for example, would have given the opprobrium for their industry at the time.\n\nMorton still argues individual businesses should contribute more to industry associations like the BCA to allow them to spread their message more widely. The government acknowledges the BCA\u2019s \u201cStrong Australia\u201d campaign, for instance, aimed at talking up the benefits of a strong business sector to Morrison\u2019s quiet Australians, particularly in regional areas.\n\nBut Frydenberg has also admonished businesses about the need to spend more money on investing rather than on special dividends and share buybacks in order to stimulate better economic growth.\n\nYet many business leaders remain unimpressed with the government\u2019s agenda and resent being lectured by politicians with little experience of the pressures they are facing.\n\nReed, who has been on the board of the BCA for two years, is familiar with the tensions as well as sounding determined to overcome them.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister's been very clear that business needs to prosecute the case for business. Right. And I couldn't agree with him more,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the key thing for the BCA is to continue to prosecute the case that a competitive economy is what allows all Australians to prosper.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of commentary at the moment about the economy slowing down and whether the government should be reactive to that. We actually think that what the government needs to be doing is taking a medium-term approach to making sure that the policy settings are right to lift investment in our nation, and in particular business investment in our nation.\u201d\n\nKeen advocate of skilled immigration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in his view, the policy focus should be on issues like improving regulation, the tax system and skills development to ensure Australia remains competitive and Australians have the skills to fill the high-value jobs of the future.\n\n\u201cI don't think Australians are anti business,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Australians like to go to work and feel secure in their jobs. They want to believe that there are going to be jobs for their children \u2026 high-paying jobs. And overwhelmingly, they believe that that is going to come from a business, not from government.\u201d\n\nBut he says the old days where there could be a distinction between what went on inside a business and what was known outside are long gone. He used to tell his workforce that they should imagine there was always a video camera in the room with customers watching their conversations and conduct.\n\nHis experience at MYOB has also made him a passionate supporter of skilled immigration, both permanent and temporary, despite the increasing political sensitivity about numbers.\n\nMYOB\u2019s software development team went from about 100 to 600 over a decade only because the company was able to bring in developers with the necessary decade-plus of experience to complement every team of 10 or so.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot find those couple of people that have a decade-plus experience, you can't hire the other eight [locals],\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so the idea that giving two visas stops two Australians getting a job is just absurd.\n\n\u201cSo stories like that I will absolutely continue to tell because they are important ones that people actually understand about the way business works.\u201d", "description": "New BCA president Tim Reed wants to persuade the public and politicians that business has a very good story to tell and sell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/07036c9b42fca694039c763ac8d0e63f72c52d22", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
