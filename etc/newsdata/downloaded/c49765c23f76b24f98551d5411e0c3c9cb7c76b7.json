Yes we want to deliver Brexit.\u201d\n\nMrs May added: \u201cIf this Parliament did not mean it, then it is guilty of the most egregious con trick on the British people.\u201d\n\nMrs May said there could not be a second referendum \u201csimply because some people did not agree\u201d with the result of the first one.\n\nAddressing fears of a no-deal Brexit, Mrs May said: \u201cI\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ve said it many times, I hope this is the last time I have to say it.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want no-deal, you have to vote for a deal. Businesses are crying out for certainty, people want certainty in their lives, our investors to be able to able to invest and want the uncertainty to got rid of.\n\n\u201cThey want to know that this country is moving forward.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer (House of Commons/PA)\n\n\u201cIf you want to deliver Brexit, if you want to keep faith with British people, if you want this country to move forward then vote for the deal today.\u201d\n\nDUP MP Jim Shannon (Strangford) earlier voiced concerns over Mr Johnson\u2019s deal and warned Unionists in Northern Ireland have been \u201ctreated as second-class citizens, and our opinion, I say, means nothing\u201d.\n\nBut Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois added: \u201cThe ERG (European Research Group) met this morning. And normally our meetings are private.\n\n\u201cBut under the circumstances there are three things I thought I should share with the House.\n\n\u201cOne, the officers overwhelmingly recommended backing the Prime Minister\u2019s deal. The ERG overwhelmingly recommended the same, and no member of the ERG spoke against it.\n\n\u201cThirdly, and most importantly, we agreed that if you vote for the deal, you vote for the Bill.\n\n\u201cAnd if the deal is passed today, we will faithfully vote the Bill through to the end, so we can leave the European Union. You have our word.\u201d\n\nFor Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: \u201cSome colleagues are tempted to vote for the deal because they believe it prevents or removes the possibility of crashing out on WTO terms.\n\n\u201cIt does not.\n\n\u201cUnder the previous deal, if the future relationship was not ready by the end of transition, the backstop kicked in. That prevented WTO terms.\n\n\u201cThat has gone. This is a trap door to no-deal.\u201d", "description": "The former prime minister, who was unsuccessful to get her agreement through the Commons, joked she had a sense of deja vu.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/14/wire-19923850-1571490633-538_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
