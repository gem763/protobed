You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAs of 31 August, a total of 188,600 people, 14 per cent of those who have applied, were still waiting for an outcome on their applications.\n\nThe data also showed an increase in the proportion of applicants getting pre-settled status, which grants them five years\u2019 residency in the UK before they have to re-apply, raising concerns people may have been wrongly denied permanent immigration status.\n\nMaike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, said: \u201cThe worrying increase in grants of pre-settled status and the rapidly-expanding backlog of undecided cases are a time-bomb for the next government.\n\n\u201cIt is not unreasonable to suspect that the growing backlog is hiding decisions that will tarnish the government\u2019s \u2018no refusal\u2019 mantra. The government needs to engage with this worrying trend and tackle the underlying causes.\u201d\n\nChai Patel, legal director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the government was \u201cusing fear\u201d against EU citizens.\n\nHe added: \u201cFear of losing their houses, their jobs, their right to live in the country that is their home. Those fears will become a reality for those most vulnerable EU citizens who will not have applied by December 2020, like children in care.\n\n\u201cWe need automatic settled status for all EEA nationals and their family members, so no one needs to be afraid.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
