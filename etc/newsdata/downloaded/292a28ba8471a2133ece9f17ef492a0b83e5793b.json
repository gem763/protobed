The petite pop princess is furiously scrolling through her phone, trying to gauge the reaction to her brand new record, Charli, which dropped just over 12 hours ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in and out of the internet, honestly, I haven\u2019t done a full, deep dive, but\u2026\u201d she pauses, before showing me an Instagram video of someone giving a lap dance to \u201cClick,\u201d one of the tracks from her first proper release in five years.\n\n\u201cLike great, good for them right now,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cI think the reaction has been good.\u201d\n\nThe 27-year-old Brit, who first strutted her stuff in raves across London 10 years ago\u2014and rose to stardom after providing the infectious hooks on Icona Pop\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Care\u201d and Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy\u201d\u2014is a far cry from the woman on 2014\u2019s Sucker. She began working with different producers to find her sound, which blossomed into her relationship with her now-creative director A.G. Cook. Their two mixtapes that dropped in 2017, Number 1 Angel and Pop 2, changed the course of her artistic trajectory into all things synthetic and shiny, influencing the freedom and independence she explored on Charli.\n\n\u201cI was just so free on those mixtapes\u2014I didn\u2019t care,\u201d she says. \u201cI was learning this new language, so to speak, and I think just becoming more and more confident being who I truly am as an artist\u2014not worrying about commercial success or streams or stats of any kind, and just truly making the music I wanted to make.\u201d\n\nA handful of tracks from Pop 2 ended up inspiring those on Charli. \u201cTrack 10\u201d from Pop 2 reappears as \u201cBlame It On Your Love,\u201d a more polished gem with a bouncing beat that features a verse from the almighty Lizzo. And the reimagining worked\u2014to the tune of nearly 35 million streams.\n\nThe album is studded with collaborators on nearly every song, and features longtime friends like Brooke Candy (who appeared on Charli\u2019s debut True Romance), established names like HAIM and Sky Ferreira, and some of 2019\u2019s rising stars, such as Lizzo and Clairo.\n\nDespite all the features, Charli teased that the record was her most personal yet when she announced the album in June. She tells The Daily Beast that she didn\u2019t realize that the album would become so intimate during the creative process.\n\n\u201cIt was just that I was recording on days where I felt really emotional sometimes, and that was captured in the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cBut looking at it as a body of work, I\u2019m actually really happy that it went down this road because it feels very special to me now. It really does feel like I\u2019ve been able to capture a snapshot of who I am right now.\u201d\n\nThe most eclectic track on the record, \u201cShake It,\u201d features the familiar quartet of Brooke Candy, Pabllo Vittar, CupcakKe, and XCX, which created Pop 2\u2019s highlight \u201cI Got It.\u201d Charli says that she wanted to do an \u201cI Got It Part Two,\u201d but with someone else in particular: Big Freedia. And while she appears on the track to introduce each artist, she vanishes just as quickly.\n\n\u201cI wanted \u2018Shake It\u2019 to be this next step up. We wanted to do this song where I would kind of, not really be on it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe thought that would be funny and annoying to do a song that I wasn\u2019t really on, on the album, so this was the perfect moment.\u201d\n\nAnother set of related tracks, \u201c1999\u201d and \u201c2099,\u201d both feature Troye Sivan. \u201c1999,\u201d which was released nearly a year ago, is a keenly aware self-own, where XCX and Sivan sing about wishing they could go back to the \u201890s\u2014even though Sivan would have been 5 and XCX 8 in \u201899. Charli was keen on reteaming with Sivan, only this time do something entirely different.\n\n\u201cI made this really nostalgic pop song, so I kind of wanted to do the exact opposite,\u201d she offers. \u201cI knew that he was into Pop 2, and I know when we did \u20181999\u2019 it was very cool for us, like we made the fun video, but we both wanted to get a little weirder. So \u20182099\u2019 was a way for us to do that.\u201d\n\nNot all the tracks on Charli are hard-hitting, mega-produced pop bangers. Standout track \u201cOfficial\u201d features just keys in the beginning, while Charli lists off intimate moments between her on-and-off partner that could make them an official couple. It\u2019s a track that is so personal, Charli has trouble finding the words to describe it. In fact, she didn\u2019t even want to include it on the record.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s hard for me because it is so emotional, it is so stripped back, it\u2019s like\u2026I mean you can tell I\u2019m even weird talking about it. It feels so vulnerable and so exposed, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m embarrassed of it. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason \u2018Official\u2019 is on the album is because of A.G. [Cook],\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me because it is so emotional, it is so stripped back, it\u2019s like\u2026 I mean you can tell I\u2019m even weird talking about it. It feels so vulnerable and so exposed, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m embarrassed of it.\u201d\n\nBut she commended Cook\u2019s insistence, as it had stuck out as a frontrunner for fan-favorite track within hours of the album\u2019s release. Charli continued to dive deeper on the record, examining her relationship with partying and romance on tracks like \u201cThoughts\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d\u2014ideas that she previously threw around as filler material for her self-indulgent bangers.\n\nThe singer and songwriter\u2019s unprecedented moves have defined her in this new era, leading multiple outlets to brand her the pop star of the future. While she is producing music unlike anyone else in pop right now, she finds the notion ironic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve been releasing music for 10 years,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt still makes me feel like I\u2019m in the wrong time. But I don\u2019t know that there will ever be a right time for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of the reason people like me is because I\u2019m on the fringes of pop. I\u2019m never, like, fully in it, and when I am, sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of out here on my own little spaceship doing my thing. And when people get it and like it, that will be cool. But the second that people who don\u2019t get it catch up with me, I\u2019ll be onto another thing anyways.\u201d\n\nAnd as our interview winds down, she\u2019s already on to what\u2019s next. She hints at the source of bubbling drama\u2014one that\u2019s caused fandoms to collide after The 1975\u2019s frontman Matty Healy tweeted that she is a \u201cfucking force,\u201d and that he sent her a beat that she wrote on.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you anything too concrete, but there\u2019s a song, and we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt might come out, it might never come out, I don\u2019t fucking know, but I really respect The 1975.\u201d\n\nHer eyes widen as she continues, \u201cI am working on so much stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019m supposed to have my head in this and be excited that my album came out,\u201d she says in a sarcastic tone. \u201cWhich I am, but my brain is just itching to move on. I wanna make the next album now.\u201d", "description": "The British pop star returns with her most personal record yet, a dazzling force of next-level sounds combined with serious self-examination.", "authors": ["Anna Kaplan", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568614064/unnamed_17_bkartp", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
