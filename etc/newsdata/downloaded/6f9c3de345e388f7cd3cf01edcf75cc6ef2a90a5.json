Thousands of game, shopping, utility and selfie-editing apps are just a click away. But if you remember the FaceApp challenge from earlier this summer, we were all reminded that some of these seemingly harmless apps can present security dangers.\n\nOf course, you might not be concerned about whether Russian developers have boundless access to your goofy selfies. Maybe you still download apps and grant permissions without much thought. If so, you should know that there\u2019s a much more immediate and serious threat lurking: apps that can steal your banking information.\n\nHow mobile apps steal your financial data\n\nApps with hidden malware are becoming increasingly common, according to Jason Glassberg, an \u201cethical hacker\u201d and co-founder of Casaba Security. These apps infect legitimate app stores, as well as con people into downloading them from third parties via smishing schemes.\n\nLast year, for instance, the technology company ESET found 29 malicious apps in the Google Play store that were capable of intercepting texts, bypassing SMS two-factor authentication, installing additional malicious software onto devices and more. Google removed all these apps from the Play store once the company was notified, but more than 30,000 users had already downloaded them.\n\nAlthough rare, Apple has also dealt with periodic malware outbreaks. In 2015, for example, the notorious \u201cXcodeGhost\u201d malware was found embedded in several otherwise legitimate apps.\n\nOften, these fraudulent apps employ what are known as Trojans to steal your information. Just as the Trojan horse was used to sneak soldiers past the wall of Troy, \u201ca Trojan is an application that is malicious in nature, but disguised as something benign,\u201d said William Keppler, senior security specialist for cybersecurity company CyZen. \u201cThe malicious nature depends on the attacker\u2019s goals.\u201d\n\nFor example, a gaming app might have some sort of pay feature that allows players to buy additional game assets. When a user makes a purchase, the embedded Trojan can steal the banking information provided and then conduct unauthorized transactions, Keppler said.\n\n\u201cTrojans can do multiple things, but are often aimed at stealing your credentials from financial apps, such as banking, payment and cryptocurrency apps,\u201d Glassberg said. Once installed, the Trojan lies dormant until you open a legitimate banking or payment app on your phone. This is when the Trojan performs an \u201coverlay attack\u201d to secretly steal your information, he explained.\n\nThough there have been instances of fraudulent apps masquerading as legitimate financial institutions, most scammers that end up stealing your info do so by hiding malware in other seemingly innocuous apps such as games, calculators and photo editors. \u201cIt\u2019s not the banking apps themselves, but these other silly, what you think are harmless, apps that you then run with outlandish permissions,\u201d Glassberg said.\n\n\u201cThere's absolutely no reason for a solitaire card game to want to access data connections or your photos.\u201d - Jason Glassberg, co-founder of Casaba Security\n\nIn fact, he said that one major red flag of a malicious app is asking for strange permissions, such as access to your photos, files and network. \u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t think twice about just clicking OK. But with those certain sets of permissions ... they\u2019re able to run in the background and wait for a banking website or app to be run, and that\u2019s when they go into action,\u201d Glassberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason for a solitaire card game to want to access data connections or your photos.\u201d\n\nThough Trojans can make their way into any app store, the Google Play store has been particularly vulnerable. The Android open-source community that fosters innovation also, unfortunately, makes it easier for scammers to hide their malware in apps.\n\nGlassberg said over the last year, a number of well-known Trojans have made their way in. \u201cCerberus, Anubis and BianLian are three big ones that have successfully been introduced into the Play store and sit there, waiting for a very specific connection to a bank, and a very specific logon screen, to then go and start stealing information as it\u2019s being entered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very specific kind of attack that has been, unfortunately, fairly successful.\u201d He noted that hackers are increasingly using droppers \u2015 Trojans that download additional malware once the app is installed \u2015 to bypass various app stores\u2019 security.\n\nDon\u2019t get duped\n\nWith so many fake apps and malevolent Trojans lurking in app stores, how can you protect your phone and financial information?\n\n\u201cI get hired by these really big companies to do all sorts of very technical, specific, complicated kinds of testing, but I can share with you a secret: It\u2019s always the human element that gives up the goods,\u201d Glassberg said. People click on a link, or run software, or hand over credentials to a website and inadvertently download malicious software, which he said can often be avoided.\n\nAvoid downloading apps from sketchy sources: Though plenty of Trojans have made their way into legitimate app stores, you open yourself up to a lot less risk by sticking with the Google Play store for Android and the Apple Store for Apple devices. \u201cApps from these sources are typically vetted for malware,\u201d Keppler said. Avoid downloading anything from unknown third parties, which might not employ as strict security measures.\n\nKeep a careful eye on permissions: When installing an app, make sure the permissions it asks you to grant make sense. \u201cIf a gaming app is asking for permission to access your contacts, microphone and photos, you should ask yourself why a game needs this type of access,\u201d Keppler said. Chances are, it only does in order to run hidden, malicious software in the background.\n\nLimit the number of apps you download: Scammers often cast a wide net in hopes of reaching as many unsuspecting users as possible. That means the more apps you download, the more vulnerable you become. \u201cNot only will this eat up your drive\u2019s space, but it increases the risk of downloading malware,\u201d Keppler said. It\u2019s a good idea to keep the number of apps you download to a minimum and stick with your tried and true favorites.\n\nNever \u201cjailbreak\u201d your phone: Keppler said that when you \u201cjailbreak\u201d a phone, you bypass the restrictions put on the phone by the vendor to protect consumers. This gives you more privileges on the device than necessary. \u201cThis would allow any application that the consumer runs to have elevated privileges, which malware can exploit to perform unauthorized transactions or access sensitive information without the user\u2019s knowledge or permission,\u201d he said.\n\nTrust but verify: Finally, Glassberg explained that many people need to break their habit of granting permissions or clicking links with abandon. For example, if you receive a message on social media from one of your friends with a strange link, call or text them and ask if they really sent it before clicking. If you get an email from the bank saying that your account needs attention and you must click a link to log in, just call the bank instead. \u201cSo many of these attacks are preventable with just a little common sense,\u201d he said.", "description": "It's time to start paying much closer attention to permissions.", "authors": ["Money", "Home", "Living Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db0b2da210000ae2534adb0.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
