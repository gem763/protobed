Congressman Elijah Cummings was a fearless leader, a protector of democracy, and a fighter for the people of Maryland. Our world is dimmer without him in it.\u201d\n\nCummings was the son of sharecroppers, and rose to become one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress. He was born in 1951 to parents from South Carolina who moved north as part of the Great Migration, hoping to improve their lives and provide better opportunities for their family.\n\nCummings, who was told in high school that he would not succeed academically, defied expectations from an early age. He ultimately earned a political science degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he was student government president. He then earned a law degree from the University of Maryland and was a practicing attorney.\n\nHe entered politics in 1983 and served 14 years in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he was the first African American in the state\u2019s history to be named speaker pro-tem.\n\nSince he won a House seat in a special election in 1996, he has been a leading voice in Congress, and has never been seriously challenged in either a primary or general election.\n\nCummings represented his district in Baltimore tirelessly, and campaigned for stricter gun control and help for those addicted to drugs.\n\nHe rose to national prominence in 2015, in the wake of the death in police custody of Freddie Gray. As people rioted in the hours after Gray\u2019s funeral, Cummings walked through the streets of Baltimore with a bullhorn, calling for calm.\n\nSince 2016, Cummings has been using his position in Congress to focus attention on Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing while in office. In July, he vehemently defended his hometown after the president called it \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess.\u201d\n\nCover: Rep.
