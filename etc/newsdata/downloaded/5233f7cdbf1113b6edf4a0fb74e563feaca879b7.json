While the Tesla Model S can already play video games using the 17-inch dashboard screen, Lee used a separate dock to secure his Nintendo Switch to the windshield so he could get his \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" fix.\n\nTo be clear, drivers should not try to replicate Lee's setup. Lee admitted that his mother was upset when he sent her the video of himself playing games from behind the wheel. Every Tesla model now supports autopilot mode, which uses an array of sensors to detect other cars and obstacles on the road. However, Tesla says the cars still require \"active driver supervision\" and are not fully autonomous.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk revealed his favorite character in 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is a fan of \"Super Smash Bros\" and he hasn't been shy about his desire to make video games a standard part of Tesla's offerings. Tesla's are currently capable of playing at least nine games, and last year Musk put out a recruiting call for video game developers to consider joining Tesla.\n\nImportantly, the built-in games are only playable when the Tesla is parked.\n\nLee certainly isn't the only gamer to dream of playing \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" on the road. Last week \"Super Smash Bros.\" tournament organizer and illustrator Sydnie Ortiz showed off a \"Super Smash Bros.\" setup she installed in the dashboard of her stick-shift Honda.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch is currently the best-selling video game system on the market, and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" is one its most popular titles.", "description": "The Tesla Model S can already play games on its 17-inch screen, but Lee found a way to play his Nintendo Switch with the car in self-driving mode.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80f3ad2e22af4ab6440a32-480-240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
