The signatories are members of that group, Checks and Balances.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig, who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Department on Homeland Security, said he personally would have gone further than the group\u2019s comments, which are stern, but measured in tone.\n\n\u201cIt strikes me that no reasonable attorney can doubt that there was a quid pro quo here,\u201d said Rosenzweig, referring to Trump\u2019s holding back military aid to Ukraine while requesting the country investigate a political foe.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would vote for impeachment, and I would vote for conviction and removal in the Senate as well,\u201d Rosenzweig said.\n\nAD\n\nFor Stuart M. Gerson, who worked on President George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign and in his administration, the joint statement adds a conservative perspective to the cacophony of people on the left backing impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s important there be a loyal opposition from the conservative side in defense of the rule of law,\u201d Gerson said. \u201cWe feel duty-bound to be able to do it. What\u2019s at risk here is more than our country should stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere comes a tipping point where you look at this and say my country first, the party comes second,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nDon Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, said he found it \u201cinexplicable\u201d that other Republicans were sticking by Trump.\n\n\u201cI am disgusted by the conduct of Republican senators who pose as reputable people, but shamelessly hide under rocks instead of calling out the president\u2019s horrendous behavior as the gross misconduct that they know it to be,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t that many people defending [Trump] in an affirmative way,\u201d Ayer added. \u201cThere are a lot of people who put their heads down and don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\n\nRosenzweig said the goal of the joint statement is to give Republicans \u201cintellectual cover\u201d to stand up with other conservatives and say, \u201cthe emperor has no clothes\u201d and \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Republicans in Congress have \u201cbeen a greater disappointment to me than Trump himself,\u201d Rosenzweig said. So far, not one has come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cTrump is Trump. His nature is his nature. He\u2019s not any different than the person I knew he was going to be three years ago,\u201d Rosenzweig said.\n\n\u201cBut the people who I cannot hold any honor for are the Republicans. There\u2019s lots of really smart Republicans who understand what\u2019s at stake here. They are not stepping up and throwing a flag,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey all know it\u2019s wrong. They\u2019re not idiots. They just need the courage, so if others say it first, perhaps that helps.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The 16 attorneys, many of whom worked in Republican administrations, lay out why they believe Trump violated his oath of office.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M3_tul0yDuK4R-YGbDONGw-Ctg4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PUEXAIHLMII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
