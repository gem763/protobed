I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in. On Oct. 21, the candidate you vote for will SHAPE CLIMATE POLICY.\n\n\"I'm proud of the climate progress made the last 4 years.\"\n\nMany have taken this to mean that the Hollywood super couple have had another girl.\n\nThey already have two daughters, James, four, and Inez, two.\n\n(Image: SartorialPhoto / SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nBlake first let the world know she was expecting back in May, when she showed off her bump at the LA premiere of Ryan's film, Detective Pikachu.\n\nTheir marriage is the subject of a jealousy - the two conduct themselves with utmost love and respect for each other, but also some pretty savage humour.\n\nBlake has previously dished about the secret to their wedded bliss - treat Ryan like one of her pals.\n\nShe explained: \"In other relationships, if something came up I would call my girlfriends or my sister, and say, 'Hey, this is what he did - what should I do?'\n\n\"Whereas with him [Ryan], we were friends for two years before we were ever dating. And I treat him like my girlfriend.\"", "description": "Ryan was posting about the impact of climate policy in his native British Columbia and accompanied his words with a snap of him, wife Blake and their new baby", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Sartorialphoto", "Splashnews.Com", "Rex Features"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article15025625.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Ryan-Reynolds.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
