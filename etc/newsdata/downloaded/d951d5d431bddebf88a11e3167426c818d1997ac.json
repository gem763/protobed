REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nDuring recent holidays, tens of thousands of protesters staged demonstrations, including in downtown Seoul on Wednesday. The capital saw more candle-lit gatherings on Saturday.\n\nAn investigation into corruption allegations involving the family of justice minister Cho Kuk, who was appointed only in September, has led to major counter-demonstrations from the liberal end of the political spectrum.\n\nThese demonstrators see the investigation into Cho as politically motivated and are calling on the Moon administration to follow through with promised reforms. Many participated in the 2016-2017 candle-lit protests against Park, a conservative.\n\nThe reforms include improving oversight of prosecutors\u2019 investigations, barring overly prolonged or late interrogations, and limiting investigations from spilling over into other probes, according to the Justice Ministry.\n\n\u201cThe reason I am here to support minister Cho Kuk is that previous prosecution reform has failed,\u201d said Kim Hyeon-jung, 61, who joined a demonstration in support of Cho near the public prosecutor\u2019s office on Saturday.\n\nOn the other side, critics of liberal President Moon Jae-in routinely stage demonstrations in downtown Seoul. The corruption scandal involving Cho has further galvanised conservative groups after the political disaster of Park\u2019s impeachment over bribery allegations.\n\nCho\u2019s family is facing probes into irregular investments and his children\u2019s\u2019 favourable treatment in university admission.\n\nProsecutors summoned Cho\u2019s wife for questioning for the fourth time on Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\nCho has not denied the allegations against his family members but has apologised for disappointing the people. He said on Tuesday that he was still committed to reforming the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI will carry out my duty until the last moment I am in this position,\u201d he told a news briefing.\n\nBoth conservative and liberal groups have staged large demonstrations, with each side trading competing claims over the size of their crowds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never been to a protest before last Thursday,\u201d 34-year-old Lee Soo-min, a mother of one from eastern Seoul, told Reuters while attending an opposition rally on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBut I got so angry over what a hypocrite Cho is,\u201d she said while holding a sign calling for Cho to resign. \u201cMoon is not listening to anyone except his supporters.\u201d\n\nDIFFERING VIEWS\n\nThe scandal has broadened into a wider political clash, said Shin Jin-wook, a professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul.\n\n\u201cThe Minister Cho and prosecution reform issue became a catalyst for people to take collective action because it overlapped with older issues, such as differing views on national security, the economy, and politics,\u201d Shin said.\n\n\u201cBut because of the diverse views even within each camp, it\u2019s still unclear what direction national opinion will take going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nMoon already faces public discontent over a sluggish economy and stalled diplomacy with North Korea. These, and the Cho scandal, have helped keep his approval numbers near historic lows.\n\nHis approval rating stood at 43%, according to a Gallup Korea survey conducted on Oct. 8 and 10.\n\nAnother survey conducted earlier this week by Realmeter put Moon\u2019s approval rating at 42.5 percent, the lowest the pollster had registered since Moon became president.\n\nMoon has continued to back Cho and told senior aides on Monday that although \u201cpublic opinion can be divided on political issues, I do not think that means that national opinion is divided\u201d.", "description": "A growing corruption scandal involving a newly-appointed justice minister is bringing South Koreans from both ends of the political spectrum into the streets in numbers rarely seen since protests helped bring down former leader Park Geun-hye in 2017.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439941280&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B060", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
