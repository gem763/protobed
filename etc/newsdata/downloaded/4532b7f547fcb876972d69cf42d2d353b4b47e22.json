Her organisation provides training courses to businesses, students and community groups on how to be open to other political views and change people\u2019s opinions.\n\nThe awards are being funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, and nominations open this weekend.\n\nA shortlist will be announced in January, with an award ceremony in March 2020, and there will be a \u00a33,000 prize donated to the winning politician of the year\u2019s charity of choice.\n\nThe judges come from across the political spectrum and include the Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb; Gawain Towler, the Brexit party\u2019s director of communications; the Tory peers David Willetts and Sayeeda Warsi; and Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of the Spectator.", "description": "Annual prizes to honour politicians for courtesy and decency amid anger over Brexit", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b32bb0de1c485a57d3a3778ddd286ca5e1bcc3/40_43_3431_2059/master/3431.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d06a54435aa9563fb5b6309adcc5790", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
