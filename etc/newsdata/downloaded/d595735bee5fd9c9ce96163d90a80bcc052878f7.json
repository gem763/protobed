Tulsi Gabbard became the 12th Democratic candidate Tuesday to qualify for the fourth presidential debate in October.\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman received 2% support in a Monmouth University poll Tuesday, meeting the threshold to join 11 other candidates on Oct. 15 for a CNN/New York Times hosted debate near Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCandidates were required to obtain 130,000 unique donors and at least 2% in Democratic National Committee-endorsed polls to qualify for the third and fourth debates.\n\nWhile Ms. Gabbard had met the donor requirement several weeks ago, her lack of qualifying polls prevented her from attending the third debate earlier this September.\n\nShe called out the DNC at the end of August for lacking \u201ctransparency\u201d in its selection of \u201ccertified\u201d polls.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no explanation or transparency around why certain polls are qualifying, while other very credible, recognized polls are somehow not qualifying,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cFrankly, the DNC has not provided any transparency to voters about how they\u2019re making these decisions.\u201d\n\nMs. Gabbard\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to comment.\n\nThe only candidate within striking distance of joining the debate is author Marianne Williamson, who has met the donor threshold but needs three more qualifying polls at 2% or higher.\n\nCandidates have until Oct. 1 to qualify for the debates, after which the DNC says it will decide whether the debate will be held on one night or bridged into a two-night event on Oct. 16, according to The Hill.\n\nThe current lineup includes all 10 candidates who appeared in the September debate, plus billionaire investor Tom Steyer, who qualified earlier this month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
