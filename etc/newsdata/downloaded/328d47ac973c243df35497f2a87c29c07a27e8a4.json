It would also ensure that we stabilize the region so that rebuilding civilian life is once again possible, and so that those who have fled can also return voluntarily.\"\n\nShe did not offer more detail on how such a zone would be secured and whether German troops would be involved. The German parliament would have to approve such a deployment.\n\n\"My recommendation is that we establish an internationally controlled security zone in cooperation with Turkey and Russia.\" \u2014 German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\n\nNortheastern Syria, previously one of the war-torn country's most stable regions, has become a battleground after Turkey launched a military operation aimed at driving Syrian Kurdish fighters away from the border.\n\nAmid the fighting, several hundred Islamic State members reportedly escaped from Kurdish custody. More than 100,000 people have become displaced since the start of Turkey's incursion, according to the United Nations.\n\nA controversial ceasefire, announced by the United States last week, is due to expire on Tuesday evening. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan will meet with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Sochi Tuesday afternoon.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer's comments mark the first time Germany has proposed a military initiative in the Middle East.\n\nYet while her announcement was reportedly coordinated with Merkel, it had apparently not been discussed with the CDU's coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), prompting some disquiet within their ranks.\n\nIn another interview with public broadcaster ZDF on Monday, Kramp-Karrenbauer said she had informed Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, a Social Democrat, via text message that she would \"come up with a proposal.\" The foreign ministry on Tuesday told the German press agency DPA it saw a need for further discussion.\n\nSocial Democrat lawmaker and defense expert Fritz Felgentreu told Deutschlandfunk radio on Tuesday the plan had not been discussed with the SPD at all and that he had \"a lot of questions in that context,\" adding: \"That we're skeptical is obvious.\"\n\nDer Spiegel reported that Kramp-Karrenbauer's push had also taken the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, by surprise.\n\nCriticism also came from the opposition, with Greens lawmaker Omid Nouripour saying: \"The fear of refugees seems to have obscured the view of reality in parts of the CDU.\" He added that the proposal would \"reinforce Erdo\u011fan's impression that he can blackmail us with refugees.\"\n\nErdo\u011fan, who says Ankara wants to resettle some of the 3.5 million Syrians currently living in Turkey in a \"safe zone\" in northern Syria, frequently threatens to \"open the floodgates\" and send refugees to Europe. The Turkish safe zone proposal has been criticized by humanitarian organisations.\n\nMichael Link, a lawmaker from the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) said that Kramp-Karrenbauer's announcement had been \"clumsy,\" adding: \"The proposal hasn't been mentioned to their own coalition partner. One doesn't win approval in Europe if the first stumbling block lies in Berlin and the coalition partner doesn't go along.\"\n\nPraise for Kramp-Karrenbauer's proposal came from the Kurdish Community in Germany, an umbrella organization, which wrote on Twitter: \"Germany must take responsibility. It's right for [Kramp-Karrenbauer] to take initiative within NATO.\"\n\nNorbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee, told POLITICO that if nothing changed regarding Europe's \"paralysis\" over Syria, \"the total foreign policy failure of Europe will continue and quickly expand into a genuine crisis of legitimacy of the EU.\"\n\nHe added: \"Europe must act in regards to foreign and security policy, as we realize that others \u2014 the U.S., Russia or also Iran \u2014 do not act in our interest.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Hans von der Burchard and Joshua Posaner.
