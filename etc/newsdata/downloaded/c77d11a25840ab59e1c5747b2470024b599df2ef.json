In their plight to create awareness, Wavescape is teaming up with partners to host the beach co-op, taking place on 16 November 2019.\n\nHelp clean up the beach and trade the trash for some valuables like books and pre-loved clothing. Learn a bit more about marine pollution at the ocean filmmaker's master class, oceanic panel discussions and themed conservation evenings. Several South African films will be screened, all part of the effort to create community upliftment.\n\nFilms to look out for\n\nWhat is an ocean festival without huge waves?\n\nWavescape will treat visitors to a screening of the surf movie, White Rhino, featuring gigantic waves in Hawaii, Tahiti, and Fiji. On a more personal note, the tragic story of Andy Irons Kissed by God will hit Cape Town shores. The film talks about the world champion's life, struggle with mental illness and addiction and his death.\n\nIf the festival ignited a surfing spark in you, you are in luck. South Africa has some of the best beaches in the world, perfect for an avid surfer and those taking on a new hobby. From Muizenburg Beach here in Cape Town to Dolphin's Beach in Jeffereys Bay.\n\nAll proceeds from the event are donated to beneficiaries such as the NSRI, Shark Spotters, the 9 Miles Project, Ocean Pledge, Beach Co-op, South African Adaptive Surfing and Sentinel Ocean Alliance. Last year\u2019s art auction raised over R700 000 - this year Wavescape hopes to raise more money with your help. There is nothing better than having fun for a good cause.\n\nREAD: #ItsAllStillHere: Cape Town dropping into surf tourism + best waves in SA\n\n*Compiled by Thutolore Tsatsane\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
