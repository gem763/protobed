(pictured: A sheep drinks from a water trough in 'Barber's Lagoon' on the outskirts of the north-western New South Wales)\n\nMr Williams' generosity comes just months after he sparked outrage over an astonishing rant in which he recalled the moment he saw a Muslim man praying at a truck stop.\n\nIn his two minute video to Twitter from the Marulan BP on the Hume Highway, two hours from Sydney, he share how the Muslim man laid out his prayer mat in the trucker's lounge next to where he was eating.\n\n'I don't know what goes through these people's heads, I don't care what particularity care what sky fairy you pray to, you don't do it in a truckers driver's dinning room,' he said.\n\nA Gofundme page has been set up to support the cause for farmers.", "description": "Mike Williams launched a fundraiser for farmers in New South Wales and Queensland after becoming frustrated with the inaction from the governments.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie", "Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/01/19971874-0-image-a-11_1571617895214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
