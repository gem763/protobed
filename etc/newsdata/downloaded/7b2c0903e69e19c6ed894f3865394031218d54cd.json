His two windfalls total \u00a3198,750.\n\nBut the biggest cause for celebration was that he had just sold his first win for about \u00a390,000 last Sunday to use as a deposit on a new house with his partner \u2013 two days before learning he had won his second dream car.\n\nCommenting on his good fortune, Tom, from Dartford, Kent, admitted that he was \u2018gobsmacked\u2019 by the win.\n\nMr Harvey (pictured wearing a khaki coat and cracking open a bottle to celebrate) won a \u00a350k Porsche Macan S model and \u00a320k cash prize in an online spot-the-ball competition last week\n\n\u2018I must be one of the luckiest men on the planet at the moment,\u2019 he said.\n\nTom, who was attending a plumbing course in Essex with his father Bill when he received news of the latest win, added: \u2018I just ditched the course and went straight to Porsche in East London.\n\n\u2018I seriously never thought I\u2019d win once, let alone twice, so I\u2019m properly gobsmacked.\u2019\n\nMr Harvey (pictured in blue top) has been left 'gobsmacked' after having just sold his first prize, a Porsche 911 Carrera 4 GTS worth \u00a3110k, from the competition in 2017 (pictured with the Porsche two years ago).
