(She borrowed the term from her friend Gretchen Rubin, who wrote a best-selling book and now runs a blog with that name.)\n\nIt\u2019s time to embrace a national happiness project. As a daughter of Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson and the university he founded, I grew up with the Declaration of Independence in my blood. Last I checked, he did not declare American independence in the name of life, liberty, and professional success. Let us rediscover the pursuit of happiness, and let us start at home.\n\nInnovation Nation\n\nAs I write this, I can hear the reaction of some readers to many of the proposals in this essay: It\u2019s all fine and well for a tenured professor to write about flexible working hours, investment intervals, and family-comes-first management. But what about the real world? Most American women cannot demand these things, particularly in a bad economy, and their employers have little incentive to grant them voluntarily. Indeed, the most frequent reaction I get in putting forth these ideas is that when the choice is whether to hire a man who will work whenever and wherever needed, or a woman who needs more flexibility, choosing the man will add more value to the company.\n\nIn fact, while many of these issues are hard to quantify and measure precisely, the statistics seem to tell a different story. A seminal study of 527 U.S. companies, published in the Academy of Management Journal in 2000, suggests that \u201corganizations with more extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance\u201d among their industry peers. These findings accorded with a 2003 study conducted by Michelle Arthur at the University of New Mexico. Examining 130 announcements of family-friendly policies in The Wall Street Journal, Arthur found that the announcements alone significantly improved share prices. In 2011, a study on flexibility in the workplace by Ellen Galinsky, Kelly Sakai, and Tyler Wigton of the Families and Work Institute showed that increased flexibility correlates positively with job engagement, job satisfaction, employee retention, and employee health.\n\nThis is only a small sampling from a large and growing literature trying to pin down the relationship between family-friendly policies and economic performance. Other scholars have concluded that good family policies attract better talent, which in turn raises productivity, but that the policies themselves have no impact on productivity. Still others argue that results attributed to these policies are actually a function of good management overall. What is evident, however, is that many firms that recruit and train well-educated professional women are aware that when a woman leaves because of bad work-family balance, they are losing the money and time they invested in her.\n\nEven the legal industry, built around the billable hour, is taking notice. Deborah Epstein Henry, a former big-firm litigator, is now the president of Flex-Time Lawyers, a national consulting firm focused partly on strategies for the retention of female attorneys. In her book Law and Reorder, published by the American Bar Association in 2010, she describes a legal profession \u201cwhere the billable hour no longer works\u201d; where attorneys, judges, recruiters, and academics all agree that this system of compensation has perverted the industry, leading to brutal work hours, massive inefficiency, and highly inflated costs. The answer\u2014already being deployed in different corners of the industry\u2014is a combination of alternative fee structures, virtual firms, women-owned firms, and the outsourcing of discrete legal jobs to other jurisdictions. Women, and Generation X and Y lawyers more generally, are pushing for these changes on the supply side; clients determined to reduce legal fees and increase flexible service are pulling on the demand side. Slowly, change is happening.\n\nAt the core of all this is self-interest. Losing smart and motivated women not only diminishes a company\u2019s talent pool; it also reduces the return on its investment in training and mentoring. In trying to address these issues, some firms are finding out that women\u2019s ways of working may just be better ways of working, for employees and clients alike.\n\nExperts on creativity and innovation emphasize the value of encouraging nonlinear thinking and cultivating randomness by taking long walks or looking at your environment from unusual angles. In their new book, A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change, the innovation gurus John Seely Brown and Douglas Thomas write, \u201cWe believe that connecting play and imagination may be the single most important step in unleashing the new culture of learning.\u201d\n\nSpace for play and imagination is exactly what emerges when rigid work schedules and hierarchies loosen up. Skeptics should consider the \u201cCalifornia effect.\u201d California is the cradle of American innovation\u2014in technology, entertainment, sports, food, and lifestyles. It is also a place where people take leisure as seriously as they take work; where companies like Google deliberately encourage play, with Ping-Pong tables, light sabers, and policies that require employees to spend one day a week working on whatever they wish. Charles Baudelaire wrote: \u201cGenius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will.\u201d Google apparently has taken note.\n\nNo parent would mistake child care for childhood. Still, seeing the world anew through a child\u2019s eyes can be a powerful source of stimulation. When the Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote The Strategy of Conflict, a classic text applying game theory to conflicts among nations, he frequently drew on child-rearing for examples of when deterrence might succeed or fail. \u201cIt may be easier to articulate the peculiar difficulty of constraining [a ruler] by the use of threats,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhen one is fresh from a vain attempt at using threats to keep a small child from hurting a dog or a small dog from hurting a child.\u201d\n\nThe books I\u2019ve read with my children, the silly movies I\u2019ve watched, the games I\u2019ve played, questions I\u2019ve answered, and people I\u2019ve met while parenting have broadened my world. Another axiom of the literature on innovation is that the more often people with different perspectives come together, the more likely creative ideas are to emerge. Giving workers the ability to integrate their non-work lives with their work\u2014whether they spend that time mothering or marathoning\u2014will open the door to a much wider range of influences and ideas.\n\nEnlisting Men\n\nPerhaps the most encouraging news of all for achieving the sorts of changes that I have proposed is that men are joining the cause. In commenting on a draft of this article, Martha Minow, the dean of the Harvard Law School, wrote me that one change she has observed during 30 years of teaching law at Harvard is that today many young men are asking questions about how they can manage a work-life balance. And more systematic research on Generation Y confirms that many more men than in the past are asking questions about how they are going to integrate active parenthood with their professional lives.\n\nAbstract aspirations are easier than concrete trade-offs, of course. These young men have not yet faced the question of whether they are prepared to give up that more prestigious clerkship or fellowship, decline a promotion, or delay their professional goals to spend more time with their children and to support their partner\u2019s career.\n\nYet once work practices and work culture begin to evolve, those changes are likely to carry their own momentum. Kara Owen, the British foreign-service officer who worked a London job from Dublin, wrote me in an e-mail:\n\nI think the culture on flexible working started to change the minute the Board of Management (who were all men at the time) started to work flexibly\u2014quite a few of them started working one day a week from home.\n\nMen have, of course, become much more involved parents over the past couple of decades, and that, too, suggests broad support for big changes in the way we balance work and family. It is noteworthy that both James Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and William Lynn, deputy secretary of defense, stepped down two years into the Obama administration so that they could spend more time with their children (for real).\n\nGoing forward, women would do well to frame work-family balance in terms of the broader social and economic issues that affect both women and men. After all, we have a new generation of young men who have been raised by full-time working mothers. Let us presume, as I do with my sons, that they will understand \u201csupporting their families\u201d to mean more than earning money.\n\nI have been blessed to work with and be mentored by some extraordinary women. Watching Hillary Clinton in action makes me incredibly proud\u2014of her intelligence, expertise, professionalism, charisma, and command of any audience. I get a similar rush when I see a front-page picture of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, deep in conversation about some of the most important issues on the world stage; or of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, standing up forcefully for the Syrian people in the Security Council.\n\nThese women are extraordinary role models. If I had a daughter, I would encourage her to look to them, and I want a world in which they are extraordinary but not unusual. Yet I also want a world in which, in Lisa Jackson\u2019s words, \u201cto be a strong woman, you don\u2019t have to give up on the things that define you as a woman.\u201d That means respecting, enabling, and indeed celebrating the full range of women\u2019s choices. \u201cEmpowering yourself,\u201d Jackson said in her speech at Princeton, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to mean rejecting motherhood, or eliminating the nurturing or feminine aspects of who you are.\u201d\n\nI gave a speech at Vassar last November and arrived in time to wander the campus on a lovely fall afternoon. It is a place infused with a spirit of community and generosity, filled with benches, walkways, public art, and quiet places donated by alumnae seeking to encourage contemplation and connection. Turning the pages of the alumni magazine (Vassar is now coed), I was struck by the entries of older alumnae, who greeted their classmates with Salve (Latin for \u201chello\u201d) and wrote witty remembrances sprinkled with literary allusions. Theirs was a world in which women wore their learning lightly; their news is mostly of their children\u2019s accomplishments. Many of us look back on that earlier era as a time when it was fine to joke that women went to college to get an \u201cM.R.S.\u201d And many women of my generation abandoned the Seven Sisters as soon as the formerly all-male Ivy League universities became coed. I would never return to the world of segregated sexes and rampant discrimination. But now is the time to revisit the assumption that women must rush to adapt to the \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d that our mothers and mentors warned us about.\n\nI continually push the young women in my classes to speak more. They must gain the confidence to value their own insights and questions, and to present them readily. My husband agrees, but he actually tries to get the young men in his classes to act more like the women\u2014to speak less and listen more. If women are ever to achieve real equality as leaders, then we have to stop accepting male behavior and male choices as the default and the ideal. We must insist on changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices, too. We have the power to do it if we decide to, and we have many men standing beside us.\n\nWe\u2019ll create a better society in the process, for all women. We may need to put a woman in the White House before we are able to change the conditions of the women working at Walmart. But when we do, we will stop talking about whether women can have it all. We will properly focus on how we can help all Americans have healthy, happy, productive lives, valuing the people they love as much as the success they seek.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
