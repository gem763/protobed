Later, in the second quarter, security guards ejected Wachs and his wife after they yelled 'free Hong Kong.'\n\nWachs, who was wearing a surgical mask during the game, told Philadelphia's NBC affiliate that he previously lived in Hong Kong for two years.

'Ultimately, the decision was made by Wells Fargo Center personnel to remove the guests from the premises, which was accomplished without incident.'\n\nIn a statement, a Wells Fargo Center spokesperson claimed the couple was warned three times.\n\nWachs has denied being disruptive.\n\n'We were saying, \"Free Hong Kong,\"' Wachs told NBC10. 'What's wrong with that?'\n\nWachs's ejection came as the NBA is embroiled in an ongoing dispute with China after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey recently tweeted his support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nHouston Rockets GM Daryl Morey apologized on Monday for the now-deleted tweet in support of the Hong Kong protests\n\nAlthough Morey has since deleted it, the tweet caused the NBA a barrage of negative publicity within the prized Chinese market.\n\nChinese broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they are reviewing their ties with the NBA, which has had a presence in China since 1992.\n\nThe NBA initially described the anger over Morey's post as 'regrettable,' drawing criticism from U.S. politicians, who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver, speaking in Japan before a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.\n\nSilver said on Tuesday the league supported Morey's right to exercise his freedom of expression, further angering authorities and some fans in China and threatening the NBA's business there, which is worth an estimated $4 billion.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver (standing), speaking in Japan before a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.

Outside the team hotel, workers tore down massive banners advertising the game, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nOn Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of 'brazenly endorsing Morey's secessionist-supporting tweet' and giving 'a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.'\n\n'If Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again,' it said.\n\nThe protests were 'a bid to liberate the city' and 'a secessionist pipe-dream' peddled by demonstrators 'to justify their summer hooliganism,' the newspaper added.\n\nThe protests were sparked by opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China, but have evolved into broader calls for democracy. The protesters are not demanding secession or independence, however.\n\nSome fans expressed dismay at the way the controversy had spread, while voicing their support for Beijing's view.\n\n'I'm patriotic of course. I support that Hong Kong is part of China, but I just don't understand this,' said Yu Jie, a fan waiting to see the players in Shanghai.\n\nThe basketball furore also comes against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with disregard.\n\n'Tweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,' it said.\n\nBasketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 500 million people consuming NBA content. The league has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014.\n\nNBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league's business, is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe NBA had planned media events in Shanghai ahead of the Nets-Lakers game, but Chinese organizers canceled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday and an open training session with the Nets on Wednesday.\n\nWorkers in multiple spots around Shanghai removed large roadside NBA promotional signs that were advertising a preseason game between the Lakers and Nets scheduled for Thursday\n\nA worker removes a large poster from a building ahead of NBA Shanghai Game 2019 between Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers at the Lujiazui Zhengda Plaza\n\nState television dropped plans to air the NBA exhibition games in China this week, saying a country's sovereignty and social stability were 'not within the scope of freedom of speech.' China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong.\n\nSome Chinese fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent, which halted broadcast of Rockets games after the Morey tweet.\n\nTencent isn't the only company distancing itself from dealings with the NBA.\n\nOnline travel agency Ctrip said on Tuesday it had stopped selling tickets to NBA games and NBA-related tour packages. Smartphone maker Vivo and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) have also stopped working with the NBA.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms Alibaba and JD.com appeared to have taken Houston Rockets merchandise including sneakers off their sales platforms including mobile apps as of Wednesday night.\n\nBut the escalating row did not seem to bother some waiting outside Shanghai's Ritz Carlton hotel to catch a glimpse of the NBA players.\n\n'Personal opinions belong to them.
