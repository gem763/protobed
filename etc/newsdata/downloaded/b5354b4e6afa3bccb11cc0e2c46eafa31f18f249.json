You see the Doc\u2019s legendary rude ways have led to some poison-pen activity on his patch in Cornwall, and he has been reported to the General Medical Council for the crime of being sarky to the sick. So the GMC have sent another doctor up from London to \u201cmonitor\u201d him and see how the doctor deals with his patients, which is to say without much patience. To Doc Martin\u2019s credit \u2013 and he is played with the usual assurance by Martin Clunes \u2013 he makes no concessions to the rather officious and severe Dr Rebecca Hedden (Hermione Gulliford), and carries on talking in dense medical terminology and tells them to \u201cshut up\u201d if they start asking any awkward questions, or indeed any questions at all.\n\nYet, despite the element of tension, we all know that Dr Martin Ellingham is not going to be struck off by the GMC, because if he was, the other seven instalments of his rural adventures would have to be re-titled Ex-Doc Martin, and, presumably, reflect his efforts to find alternative employment in the depressed southwest economy post-Brexit. This wouldn\u2019t be much fun to watch (or live through, as we may soon discover). We know, in advance, that he is going to control his fear of blood most of the time, because otherwise, he would have to throw the towel in as a GP, and that he is going to give his patients the right medicines and precisely the right level of care, as Doc Martin always does. Also, his patients rather like the way he refuses to talk down to them and makes sure that they do exactly as he says \u2013 and they tell the nosey Dr Hedden precisely that.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 27 films and TV shows that were forced to change their title Show all 27 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

But the title Annie Hall was eventually settled on, inspired by actress Diane Keaton's real name, Diane Hall, and her nickname, Annie. United Artists 2/27 Dynasty (1981-89) Original title: Oil Oil The hit series, which revolves around the family of an oil magnate, was originally supposed to be titled\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Oil. But it was then changed to Dynasty to compete with rival soap Dallas. CBS Television Distribution 3/27 Back to the Future (1985) Original title: Spaceman from Pluto Spaceman from Pluto Steven Spielberg genuinely thought the title Spaceman from Pluto was a joke suggestion, so it didn\u2019t last long, and was soon replaced by the now iconic name Back to the Future. He contacted the Universal Studios head Sid Sheinberg who had suggested the Pluto title, with a message thanking him for sending his wonderful \"joke\" name, saying the office \"got a kick out of it\". Ouch. Universal Pictures 4/27 The Breakfast Club (1985) Original title: The Lunch Bunch The Lunch Bunch The original script for this classic high-school movie went by the very naff name The Lunch Bunch, but thanks to the son of one of director John Hughes's friends, who had a school detention class called The Breakfast Club, the title was changed. Universal Pictures 5/27 Fatal Attraction (1987) Original title: Affairs of the Heart Affairs of the Heart The much friendlier sounding Affairs of the Heart wasn\u2019t a great match for the psychological thriller that brought us the bunny boiler, and after it received a poor reception from audiences, the film\u2019s title was changed to Fatal Attraction. Paramount Pictures 6/27 Licence to Kill (1989) Original title: Licence Revoked Licence Revoked This Bond film was, at one time, called Licence Revoked, but test audiences associated the title too much with driving, so thankfully it was changed to something far punchier. United Artists 7/27 Saved by the Bell (1989-93) Original title: Good Morning, Miss Bliss Good Morning, Miss Bliss NBC\u2019s Good Morning Miss Bliss centred on Hayley Mills as the eponymous teacher but, after the comedy briefly moved to the Disney Channel and then back to NBC, it was re-tooled to focus on the teenage students instead, therefore taking on a new name: Saved By The Bell. CBS Studios International 8/27 Goodfellas (1990) Original title: Wiseguy Wiseguy The Scorsese classic is an adaptation of a mobster novel called Wiseguy, which was originally also the title of the film, but the name had to be changed because it had already been taken for an 80s TV series. Warner Bros 9/27 Pretty Woman (1990) Original title: 3000 3000 Originally a dark drama about class and sex work, Pretty Woman\u2019s first title was 3,000 \u2013 the amount of money that Richard Gere's character Edward spends on a week of Vivian's (Julia Roberts) time. Disney changed the name as it came across as \u201ctoo science-fictiony\u201d, as well as the tone of the movie which was turned into a rom-com fairytale. Buena Vista Pictures 10/27 Friends (1994-2004) Original title: Six of One Six of One The beloved sitcom went through many different name changes, with all the following titles considered: Friends Like Us, Six of One, Across the Hall, Once Upon a Time in the West Village, and Insomnia Cafe. It\u2019s now hard to imagine the show becoming such a monumental hit with any of those names. Warner Bros Television Distribution 11/27 Pulp Fiction (1994) Original title: Black Mask Black Mask Pulp Fiction was initially inspired by the detective crime stories in the seminal magazine Black Mask, hence its first name. The publication was a pulp magazine, which goes some way to explaining the new title. Miramax Films 12/27 Titanic (1997) Original title: The Ship of Dreams The Ship of Dreams In a line from the classic 1997 film, the older version of Rose says: \"Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was.\" It was also the original title of the film, before the simpler name of Titanic was chosen. 20th Century Fox 13/27 That '70s Show (1998-2006) Original title: Teenage Wasteland Teenage Wasteland Early ideas for the 70s sitcom\u2019s name included Teenage Wasteland and The Kids Are Alright, but because the creators couldn\u2019t get song title rights from The Who, they were forced to change the name of the show. Carsey-Werner Distribution 14/27 American Pie (1999) Original title: Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate It was a bold move from screenwriter Adam Herz when he submitted his spec script to studios under the title Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But The Executive Will Hate. But the risk paid off, with the film, eventually named American Pie, grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide. Universal Pictures 15/27 Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) Original title: Dairy Queens Dairy Queens The black comedy was originally supposed to be called Dairy Queens. However, the company that owns fast food chain Dairy Queen apparently didn't love the idea of being associated with the movie, so they filed a lawsuit and, lo and behold, Drop Dead Gorgeous was born. New Line Cinema 16/27 8 Simple Rules (2002-03) Original title: 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter This family sitcom originally had a longer name, but when star John Ritter \u2013 who played the concerned father in the show \u2013 suddenly died after filming the third episode of the second series, the show changed its format and name to 8 Simple Rules and Ritter\u2019s death was written into the plot. Buena Vista International Television 17/27 Cars (2006) Original title: Route 66 Route 66 The animated hit was initially called Route 66 after the iconic road in America, but the title was changed to Cars to avoid confusion with a 60s TV show of the same name. Buena Vista Pictures 18/27 Hannah Montana (2006-11) Original title: Alexis Texas Alexis Texas Miley Cyrus\u2019s Disney comedy was originally called Alexis Texas but, because a porn actor shares the same name, it had to be changed in case children looked up the show\u2019s title and accidentally found pornography. Disney-ABC Domestic Television 19/27 The Big Bang Theory (2007-19) Original title: Lenny, Penny and Kenny Lenny, Penny and Kenny The Big Bang Theory\u2019s original rhyming title was forced to change after the character Kenny\u2019s name switched to Sheldon, who was then brought to life by Jim Parsons. Warner Bros Television Distribution 20/27 Samantha Who? (2007-09) Original title: Sam I Am Sam I Am Clearance issues with the estate of Dr Seuss led ABC to change the name of its Christina Applegate-led show, as the original title, Sam I Am, drew on the first lines of Dr Seuss\u2019s classic Green Eggs and Ham. Disney \u2013 ABC Domestic Television 21/27 The Good Wife (2009-16) Original title: Leave the Bastard Leave the Bastard The Good Wife\u2019s creators got a call from CBS pushing them to change the title just as it went into production. The network did actually consider Leave the Bastard, but ultimately decided to play it safe with The Good Wife. CBS Television Distribution 22/27 Shutter Island (2010) Original title: Ashecliffe Ashecliffe Ashecliffe, the name of the hospital in Martin Scorcese\u2019s thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was originally going to be the film\u2019s title before it was changed to Shutter Island. Paramount Pictures 23/27 New Girl (2011-18) Original title: Chicks and Dicks Chicks and Dicks New Girl was initially pitched as \"a young ensemble comedy about the sexual politics of men and women\u201d, hence its original, provocative title: Chicks and Dicks. Not only did this name attract the wrong kind of attention, but New Girl better reflected the content of the sitcom, which ended up revolving around Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Jess. 20th Television 24/27 Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Original title: All You Need Is Kill All You Need Is Kill The Tom Cruise action movie was originally known as All You Need Is Kill, the title of the book on which the movie is based, but filmmakers changed the title because they felt the word \"kill\" was too problematic. \"I think the word 'kill' in a title is very tricky in today's world\u2026\" producer Edwin Stoff said. \u201cWe see it enough in real newspaper headlines, and I don't think we need to see it when we're looking at a movie.\" After a lucklustre box office opening, the film's name was changed once again, in marketing and for home release, to Live, Die, Repeat. Warner Bros Pictures 25/27 Lovesick (2014-18) Original title: Scrotal Recall Scrotal Recall The relationship comedy drama starring Johnny Flynn was renamed after one series because, perhaps unsurprisingly, it was suffering from a lack of word of mouth, with people reluctant to say the word \u201cscrotal\u201d. Clerkenwell Films 26/27 Stranger Things (2016-) Original title: Montauk Montauk The original title of the Netflix hit was Montauk, as the plan had been for it to be set in a village of the same name in New York. However, when creators the Duffer brothers later relocated the show\u2019s action to the fictional town of Hawkins in Indiana, the name changed to Stranger Things. Intriguingly, Montauk also happens to be the title of a short film which the Duffer brothers were accused of plagiarising. Netflix 27/27 Arrival (2017) Original title: Story of Your Life Story of Your Life The sci-fi film starring Amy Adams originally went by the title of the novella it was based on, Story of Your Life, but because producer Shawn Levy thought it \"sounds a bit like a One Direction song\u201d and \"multiword titles can be really problematic\u201d, the movie changed its name to Arrival.

Paramount Pictures\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYes, I suppose there is some interest, in a meta-sense, in trying to anticipate exactly how it could be that Doc Martin is going to avoid being struck off as a GP, and the writer, Jack Lothian, gives us the answer, but in a slightly over-elaborate way. First, the slightly odd village pharmacist/widow Sally Tishell (Selina Cadell) is asked out on a date by the rather wet Donald Abbott (Simon Chandler). The date involves them going for a day out at an offshore lighthouse. She falls down the stairs, then she accidentally impels her forearm on a screwdriver. They get Doc Martin out, but the idiot local copper manages to run the boat aground. Then the nosey doc form London gets electrocuted, the idiot copper gets electrocuted and virtually everyone is vomiting.\n\nFinally, Doc Martin saves the nosey doc\u2019s life by thumping her on the chest because her heart stops when she gets electrocuted. There\u2019s blood and sick everywhere, but the strange scene has a jolly sort of farcical quality to it. To say it is unconvincing is, in a way, to miss the point, but that is exactly what it is. Even by the standards of undemanding ITV viewing on a wet Wednesday evening in early autumn, it is not quite good enough.\n\nOverall, the whole thing is like an advert for Ginsters pasties, and just a bit too twee and Cornish, like Poldark with a stethoscope. There\u2019s even a sequence where they start chucking crates of whisky off their sinking boat, a rather contrived, and pointless reference, I presume, to the classic 1949 Ealing comedy Whisky Galore! There\u2019s such a sickly saccharine superfluity of yokel fishermen and sweet girls, cute dogs and pretty scenery that the viewer is in danger of contracting type 2 diabetes just from watching it. Doc Martin might be a grumpy so-and-so, with an inconvenient phobia about blood, but we know he has a beating heart of gold, and we don\u2019t need a CT scan to see that.\n\nThe reason, I think, that the series has run for quite so long and with such undeniable success is the consummate performance of Clunes in the lead. Doc Martin, the man and the show, is ridiculous in every sense. It has a fairly weak pulse and is getting a bit arthritic, but somehow Clunes just keeps resuscitating it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want a repeat prescription myself, though.", "description": "I suppose the problem with this first episode in the ninth \u2013 ninth! \u2013 series of Doc Martin (ITV) is that we know how it isn\u2019t going to end.
