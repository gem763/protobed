As an adult, she was dismissed by members of the boys' club, told that she was only booking gigs because she's cute, not because she's talented.\n\nBut the 33-year-old didn't let it stop her from playing music, and now she's entertaining clubs packed to capacity, with fans that line up outside before the doors even open \u2014 and she's catering to the women who show up, not men.\n\nEvery month, she hosts a female-focused dance party called Bounce Dat, where women can dance and let loose without worrying about aggressive guys \u2014 in fact, guys can only get in if they're invited by women.\n\nRising to the top! DJ Ohso has earned success and popularity \u2014 despite being told as a teen that 'girls don't DJ\n\nThat's talent! The 33-year-old Toronto native quit her job at 26 to peruse her dream, and within weeks of landing in Miami she was booking gigs\n\nLadies' night! She now hosts a popular dance party in Atlanta called Bounce Dat, where she caters to a female crowd \u2014 and men can only get in with an invite\n\nOne could say Ohso's girl power event is decades in the making, given that she was nearly excluded from the DJ scene because she's female.\n\nWhen she was 13, she snuck out to see a concert and saw a DJ for the first time \u2014 and was hooked. She came home and told her mother that that's what she wanted to do.\n\n'Girls don\u2019t DJ,' her mom told her.\n\n'I'm African, so I'm super obedient,' Ohso told DailyMail.com. 'Our parents came from Canada to the US to give us a better life \u2014 so you naturally suppress your wants as a kid to live this dream for your parents.\n\n'So I suppressed it and never thought about it again until I was in my 20s and sat next to a DJ who showed me how to use turntable. He showed me how to mix two songs together and I fell in love.\n\n'I never turned back,' she went on. 'I went and got my own equipment and practiced every day.'\n\nOne day when she was 26, she was watching a compilation of Will Smith videos and was struck by something the star said about not having a Plan B, because 'it distracts from plan A.'\n\nAt that, she quit her job to focus on DJing full time.\n\n'I like to call my life a beautiful accident. I had no idea what I was doing, I just knew I wanted to DJ for a living,' she said.\n\nDouble threat: Ohso told DailyMail.com that she's faced sexism in her career, including from guys who insist that she's only found work because she's pretty\n\n'It's not like only men can do this because they have a special part of the brain that can do it,' she said\n\nIn her hometown of Toronto, she was told she'd have to pay her dues and perform without pay for three years Instead. she packed her bags, booked an Airbnb, and moved to Miami.\n\n'I said, this is gonna be my one shot. If this doesn\u2019t work out, this isn\u2019t for me,' she said.\n\nA week after she moved, she met someone who booked her for a party \u2014 and everything changed.\n\nI felt like a circus act at the beginning. People would have their phones out, like, 'Look at this girl who DJs!'\n\n'I'm thinking I'm gonna open up because he's never seen me play before, and he's like no, I'll let you go at 1am. I had all this anxiety, like, there's gonna be people there! I was so scared, oh my god,' she said.\n\nMore nerve-racking, she learned Will Smith was there \u2014 the very star who set her on this path.\n\n'I damn near blacked out,' she said. 'But during my set I played Motown Philly and he was in the middle of the dance floor jamming.'\n\nShe took it as a sign that she was on the right path.\n\n'Of all the places he could be, he was in Miami at the club I was DJing for the first time,' she said.\n\n'After that I got a lot of opportunities. A lot of celebrities and their wives, basketball players\u2019 wives, were at that party. For that whole year, I got a lot of cool opportunities from that first gig.'\n\nBut there were obstacles \u2014 namely, men who tried to make her feel like she didn't belong.\n\nSuccess story: Ohso says Will Smith was at the first gig she booked in Miami \u2014 a dream come true, since he inspired her to go after her dream\n\nLiving it up! Her Bounce Dat parties are n incredibly popular, with women lining up before the club even opens \u2014 and dancing as soon as they walk in the door\n\n'I would have people come up to me at the DJ booth and be like, \"Hey, this area is only for the DJ,\" she said. 'I felt like a circus act at the beginning. People would have their phones out, like, \"Look at this girl who DJs!\"'\n\nBut she stuck to it, adamant that there was no reason men should keep her out.\n\n'It's not like only men can do this because they have a special part of the brain that can do it,' she said.\n\nChill: The party is a place where women can dance and let loose without worrying about getting hit on or making guys angry\n\nEven now, sexist men tell her that she only gets opportunities because she's a girl, saying, 'You\u2019re only getting booked because you\u2019re cute.'\n\n'I've been in group conversations with male DJs that have made me feel small,' she said. 'It's so offensive and insulting.'\n\nShe's kept going, though, and now hosts a monthly club night called Bounce Dat. Women are the guests of honor, and men can only get in with an invite.\n\nOhso plays music that caters to the female crowd, and there's even a beauty bar with a nail station, a baby hair station, and a temporary face tattoo station.\n\nMost importantly, though, it's a place for women to go and unwind where they don't have to worry about their safety or men who can't take a hint.\n\n'If you have a long day and you want to go out, you don\u2019t want to then deal with men trying to grab you, trying to dance with you,' she said.\n\n'I would have girls' nights [with friends] at the house and we would be listening to music and dancing and have it not be this sexual thing and I was like, \"Why can\u2019t we have this anywhere?\" I don't want to feel like I can only do this in my house.\n\nGirl power: Ohso plays music that caters to the female crowd, and there's even a beauty bar with a nail station, a baby hair station, and a temporary face tattoo station\n\nMark your calendar! On November 7 she'll host a special Bounce Dat party at MJQ nightclub as part of the Red Bull Music Festival Atlanta\n\n'I should be able to go out and feel comfortable and safe, and not encounter men who are gonna be upset if I don't wanna dance with them.\n\nThe idea has proven incredibly popular, with women lining up before the club even opens \u2014 and dancing as soon as they walk in the door. Ohso says her first event hit capacity in just a half hour, with another 100 people waiting outside.\n\nSchedule: Other acts at the festival, which will run from November 1-15, include Teyana Taylor, Ari Lennox, and Yung Baby Tate.

Ohso said some men are upset about her party, accusing her of discriminating against men while attacking her online.\n\n'[They're] literally proving why we have to have a space like that,' she said. 'We're just trying to have one night a month for women to celebrate themselves, why does it have to be about you?'\n\nNext up for Ohso is the Red Bull Music Festival Atlanta, where she'll host a special Bounce Dat party at MJQ nightclub on November 7 \u2014 with special guests like Princess and Diamond of Crime Mob, Molly Brazy, Queen Key, and pineappleCITI.\n\nShe has big plans for the night, including a photobooth where models will feel guests grapes and fan them.\n\nThere'll be a beauty bar, of course, and Ohso wants to create Bounce Dat survival kit fanny packs with scrunchies, nail polish, lip gloss, and fans.\n\nOther acts at the festival, which will run from November 1-15, include Teyana Taylor, Ari Lennox, and Yung Baby Tate.\n\nThe Atlanta festival will be followed by another one in Chicago from November 17-30 with acts like Lupe Fiasco, Tierra Whack, and Smino\u2019s Zero Fatigue.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: DJ Ohso, 33, wanted to DJ at age 13, but her mother told her girls don't DJ.
