The GOP Plans to Use Him to Undo Abortion Rights.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The name Ulrich Klopfer doesn\u2019t mean much to most Americans. But congressional Republicans are hoping to change that.\n\nKlopfer was an abortion provider in Indiana. When he died last month, more than 2,200 medically preserved fetuses were discovered at his home across the border in Illinois, quickly making Klopfer a villain of the anti-abortion movement.\n\nNow, Republicans are latching onto that villainy in a push to pass a federal law that experts say could advance the fetal personhood argument and maybe even move toward a repeal of Roe. v. Wade.\n\n\u201cThis was heinous,\u201d said Rep. Jackie Walorski, a Republican who represents an Indiana district where Klopfer once operated a clinic. \u201cWhen these babies died during abortions, what happens to their bodies?\u201d\n\nWalorski is leading Republicans\u2019 effort to leverage Klopfer\u2019s story, which made national headlines. Last week, she and 66 of her colleagues sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr asking that the Department of Justice assist Indiana and Illinois in their investigation into Klopfer.\n\nREAD: Google Maps is still directing women seeking abortions to pro-life clinics\n\nBut the letter also makes a bigger ask: to review state laws that govern the disposal of aborted fetuses. According to the letter, a federal review would help Congress decide whether to push for a federal law to mandate that fetal remains are always buried or cremated.\n\nIn truth, conservatives have already decided a federal \u201cfetal burial\u201d law is the next front in the fight against abortion. A state law already exists in Indiana. States like Arkansas and Georgia have similar laws on the books, and others are still in the process of moving legislation.\n\nLast month, after the grisly discovery on Klopfer\u2019s property in Will County, Illinois, Indiana Sens. Mike Braun and Todd Young, both Republicans, introduced a federal version in the U.S. Senate including a federal reporting requirement for clinics and fines or even jail time for failure to comply.\n\n\u201cI think it's right on with where Indiana's law is: cremation or some kind of burial. I think it's a dignity issue,\u201d Walorski said. \u201cIt goes to the issue of oversight. I think it goes to the issue that this kind of stuff can happen, does happen. And I think we should make sure it never happens again.\u201d\n\nWalorski presented the issue to her colleagues two weeks ago at a private meeting of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of Republicans in the House. Still, the bill has little chance of gaining traction in a Democrat-controlled House, and Congress and the Justice Department may be tied up with the impeachment inquiry for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut Republicans are probably playing the long game, said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor and expert in abortion law.\n\nThe shocking nature of the discovery of so many fetal remains preserved in bags could make the public sympathetic to the idea of common standards for disposal, she said.\n\nREAD: Small clinics are fighting for their lives under Trump's abortion rules\n\nIn advocating solely for burial or cremation, proponents of the law are making a deeper argument: A fetus deserves the same treatment as a fully formed human being. That reignites the debate about fetal personhood \u2014 creating a legal definition of a fetus as a living being \u2014 which could undercut Roe v. Wade. That decision established a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion, but if more states, or even the federal government, pass laws that treat fetuses like people, advocates could build a case that a fetus\u2019 rights counterbalance the rights of a woman.\n\n\u201cThis is just an example of how this issue is so sharply polarized that you can\u2019t have a sensible conversation to agree on both sides that this was a bad thing and shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Ziegler said of the Klopfer case. \u201cIt becomes a brick in the wall to get rid of Roe.\u201d\n\nZiegler added that laws regulating disposal could be designed to create an added cost or hurdle for abortion clinics \u2014 even those operating aboveboard.\n\n\u201cAbortion providers may face much higher expenses for dealing with fetal remains,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cost of a cremation or burial is obviously going to be higher than whatever contract they have with medical waste disposal facilities.\u201d\n\nREAD: The Supreme Court just agreed to hear the first major abortion case since Kavanaugh\n\nAmericans United for Life, the influential anti-abortion group, has drawn up model legislation dealing with the disposal of fetal remains. The group\u2019s senior counsel, Clarke Forsythe, insisted that the issue is not about personhood, but also said his group would not be satisfied if laws mandate that fetal remains were dealt with as medical waste rather than buried or cremated.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you technically establish personhood,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThese are human remains. They should not be thrown out. \u2026 They shouldn\u2019t be treated like medical waste.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the Indiana law but upheld the right of the state to mandate burial or cremation. A similar Texas law was struck down by a federal court last year. Forsythe said even just an attempt at federal legislation could create another opportunity for the judiciary to weigh in.\n\n\u201cI think having some congressional attention to this is a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could likely spark a test case in the courts about this specific application of congressional authority and whether Congress has the authority to legislate in this area.\u201d\n\nCover: This September 2014 file photo shows Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, who performed abortions for decades in Indiana, and allegedly preserved 2,200 fetal remains in his office and home.
