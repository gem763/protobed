His office said he died of \u201ccomplications concerning long-standing health challenges.\u201d Cummings was 68.\n\nCummings, a Democrat, was first elected to Congress in 1996. His district encompasses much of Baltimore, and throughout his career Cummings was a passionate advocate for its inner-city residents. In 2015, when riots broke out in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man who died in police custody, Cummings took to the streets with a bullhorn, calling for calm and urging crowds to go home. Cummings had spoken at Gray\u2019s funeral hours earlier, asking lawmakers to stand up and promise to seek justice for his killing.\n\nCummings\u2019s initial efforts to work with the Trump administration on bipartisan measures were ignored by the White House, and as the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee he eventually became one of Trump\u2019s biggest foils in the House. He led multiple investigations into the president, and called Trump\u2019s obstruction of these efforts \u201cfar worse than Watergate.\u201d This led to Trump lashing out at the congressman on Twitter in July, calling Baltimore \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess\u201d and \u201cthe worst run and most dangerous\u201d city in the United States. Cummings vigorously defended his city, and continued probing the administration in his final months as he battled health issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on. Because if you want to have a democracy intact for your children, and your children\u2019s children, and generations yet unborn, we\u2019ve got to guard this moment \u2026 This is our watch,\u201d Cummings said in July, after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not about liking the president, it\u2019s about loving democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted his condolences on Thursday morning, as did House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows, who shared an unlikely friendship with Cummings.\n\nThere was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings. I am heartbroken for his wonderful family and staff\u2014please pray for them.\n\n\n\nI will miss him dearly. \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) October 17, 2019\n\nIn a statement, the representative\u2019s widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, chairwoman of Maryland\u2019s Democratic Party, said, \u201cCongressman Cummings was an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion, and humility. He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation\u2019s diversity was our promise, not our problem.\u201d", "description": "Democrat Elijah Cummings was a passionate advocate for civil rights and his Baltimore constituents.
