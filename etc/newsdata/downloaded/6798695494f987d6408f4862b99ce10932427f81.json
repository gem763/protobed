Hunt Transport Services\u2019 JBHT third-quarter 2019 earnings of $1.4 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44. However, total operating revenues of $2,363.7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,348.2 million and also increased 7% year over year. The top line benefited from the strong performance of the Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) segment.\n\n\n\nQuarterly operating income (on a reported basis) rose 21% to $212.1 million. Also, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) improved to 91% from 92.1% in the prior-year quarter despite operating expenses rising 5.7% year over year. Notably, effective tax rate increased to 24.3% from 20.4% recorded in the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\n\nSegmental Performance\n\n\n\nThe Intermodal (JBI) division generated quarterly revenues of $1.24 billion, up 2% year over year.

Also, operating income increased 10% year over year.\n\n\n\nRevenues at DCS rose 28% year over year to $696 million, courtesy of a 9% increase in truck productivity. Excluding fuel surcharges, productivity increased roughly 11% owing to the Cory 1st Choice Home Delivery acquisition and higher customer rates among other factors. Further, operating income soared more than 100% year over year to $78.3 million owing to the addition of trucks and ramped up productivity.\n\n\n\nIntegrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) revenues dipped 3% year over year to $337 million with volumes contracting 4%. Revenue per load, however, inched up 2% year over year owing to competitive pricing among other factors.\n\n\n\nTruck (JBT) revenues declined 11% year over year to $94 million. At the end of the third quarter, total tractors were 1,896 (of which 859 were company-owned) compared with 1,972 in the year-ago quarter. Trailers increased to 6826 in the period compared with 6818 a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, operating income dropped 28% to $6.6 million due to decreased truck loads.\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
