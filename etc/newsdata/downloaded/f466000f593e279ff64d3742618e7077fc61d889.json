I\u2019m ripped!\u2019 That was probably the peak of it. I\u2019m getting to a place now where I\u2019m rivaling that. I\u2019m pretty happy with what I\u2019ve got going now.\u201d\n\nToday, the musician's workouts largely focus on rotation and mobility, emphasizing shoulder work, targeting the posterior chain and strengthening the core.\n\nFITNESS BLOGGER CELEBRATES 3 YEARS WITHOUT ADDERALL AFTER DRUG 'RUINED' HER LIFE\n\nOne example of Weir\u2019s intense commitment to training is the metal cart of workout equipment that \u201caccompanies him on every tour\u201d with Dead and Company. In the months ahead, the cart will follow him to shows in New York City, Virginia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Cancun, Mexico through the end of 2019 \u2013 all the more reason to stay energized.\n\nWeir, who founded the Grateful Dead at age 16 with the late Jerry Garcia, told Men\u2019s Health that he fell in love with football around the same time, when he played linebacker and defensive end in high school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most complicated sport there is. You\u2019ve got people with virtually every kind of body type who specialize in doing what that body type can do,\u201d he said of the game. \u201cAll that comes together, and if the team moves as one, it\u2019s really pretty awesome.\n\n\u201cI can still throw a ball that you can hear comin\u2019,\u201d Weir claimed, as he tossed a 20-pound medicine ball with a staffer.\n\nIn a larger sense, Weir agreed that he was something of the \u201cquarterback\u201d for his legendary band back in the day.\n\n\u201cI might have been [like a quarterback,] come to think of it. Organizational stuff is one of my strong suits, and a quarterback is an organizational kind of guy,\u201d he mused. \u201cJerry was something of an elusive yet powerful running back. He could do it all. But I was cueing the up and down because Jerry was f------ busy.\u201d\n\nBeyond their differences, the musician said that his and Garcia\u2019s personalities truly complimented each other in many ways.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cI admired Jerry because he didn\u2019t give a s--- about any of that, and I think he admired me because I did,\u201d Weir recalled. \u201cI admired his ability to just say, \u2018F--- it. I\u2019m going to suck down a couple of cheeseburgers and a pizza and a couple of White Russians, and I\u2019m going to be fine about that.\u2019 Working out was just too much effort and too much pain.\u201d\n\nDespite his lifelong love for strength training and conditioning \u2013 and his recent habit of sharing workout videos to Instagram \u2013 the septuagenarian said he never forced his interest on his Grateful Dead bandmates.\n\n\u201cI never pushed it, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my right. It\u2019s a lot like pushing religion. I don\u2019t think any human has a right to do that,\u201d Weir said.\n\nAs for his own wellness philosophy, with over 50 years of performing under his belt, the rocker said that he needs three things to be happy \u2013 a feeling of dedication to \u201cthe pursuit of a sense of purpose,\u201d meditation, and of course, exercise \u2013 wherever in the world his adventures may lead him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMoving forward, Weir said he\u2019s eager to break up his usual fitness routine by experimenting with yoga trapeze and underwater workouts.\n\n\u201cI [recently] saw a video clip of a guy working out underwater; he took a kettlebell from the bottom of a squat position and powered into a backflip and came back around to the squat. I wanna do stuff like that,\u201d the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member told Men\u2019s Health.\n\nPerhaps, Weir says, he\u2019ll find a penchant for something new, like he did with one of his favorite drills of the moment \u2013 beating a tire with a gada mace \u2013 which he picked up after embracing CrossFit a few years ago.\n\n\u201cThe practice goes back thousands of years. The old original martial art was learning how to swing a big heavy thing and keep your balance and keep yourself collected,\u201d he said of the practice. \u201cYou can feel when you\u2019re slipping from the proper form; there\u2019s a timelessness about it.\u201d", "description": "Age is nothing but a number for the legendary rocker.", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
