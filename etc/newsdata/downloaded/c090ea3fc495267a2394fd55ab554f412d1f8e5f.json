Treasuries climbed with gold and the yen on demand for haven assets.\n\nThe S&P 500 suffered its first back-to-back drops of more than 1% this year, pushing its two-day slump to the most in two months, as private payrolls fell short of estimates a day after a manufacturing gauge slumped to the lowest in a decade. The index plunged below 2,900 and took out its average price for the past 100 days, levels it hadn\u2019t breached in a month.\n\nCarmakers sank after quarterly sales reports from Ford and General Motors added to concern over thinning profit margins in the industry. All S&P 500 sectors but one sank more than 1%, with industries most sensitive to economic growth dropping the most. Tech and industrials plunged 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 500 points.\n\nThe hiring numbers pushed the 10-year Treasury yield lower for a fifth straight day as it pushed below 1.6%. The yen rose versus the dollar and gold spiked above $1,500. The equity rout spread to Europe, where the Stoxx 600 saw its biggest slide in 10 months and the FTSE 100 dropped the most since 2016. Oil fell below $53 a barrel after a report showed U.S. crude inventories increased.\n\nThe disappointing data out of the U.S. and Europe, as well as weak earnings reports from automakers this week, is forcing investors to reconsider their strategies. The most recent economic numbers are driving concerns that a slowdown, which had been mostly confined to manufacturing, may be spreading to the consumer as the U.S.-China trade war drags on. Those fears increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month. Focus now turns to services PMI data on Thursday and the nonfarm payrolls data on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn addition to ISM yesterday, you had auto sales data. You had Honda, Toyota, Nissan with double-digit declines. Much worse than expected,\u201d Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird, said by phone. \u201cIt raises enough questions about how resilient is the consumer at this point.
