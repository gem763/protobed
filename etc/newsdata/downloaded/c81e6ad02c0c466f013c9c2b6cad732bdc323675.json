The simple packaging is indistinguishable for each phone, with no labeling anywhere on the box for which device the protector is made for.\n\nThe glass screen protector is $25, which is reasonable for a glass protector. The protector was easy to apply, has no bubbles anywhere, and fits well. At first, I found the touchscreen to be less responsive, but realized that running the included microfiber cloth over it a few times helps the protector adhere tightly to the display so that everything works perfectly.\n\nTotallee also offers sleek case options for the Pixel 3 that I have enjoyed using.", "description": "As expensive as phones are today, it's worth spending $25 to add a tempered glass protector to act as a sacrificial anode for your display.
