He had agreed with the party leadership that he would move on after wrapping up the election campaign.\n\nThe DA were the biggest losers of the 2019 general elections, dropping to 21% from the 22% the party had garnered in 2014. A significant share of the more than 400 000 votes lost by the party appears to have gone to the Freedom Front Plus, who experienced significant growth.\n\nThis election was party leader Mmusi Maimane\u2019s first election at the helm after he succeeded former party leader Helen Zille.\n\nAlthough Moakes would have left the party regardless of the outcomes of the elections, in his resignation letter he states that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the party\u2019s performance at the polls.\n\nMoakes says that he is busy compiling a review of the party\u2019s performance but does point out in the letter a number of issues the party must grapple with.\n\nIt is with great sadness that I have witnessed this sense of care being slowly eroded by some over the past number of years\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our party has been at a crossroads for some time now with some pretty fundamental disagreement as to who we are, who we are fighting for and what we want to achieve. It is my hope that the party engages in the necessary processes to resolve these questions so that we can move forward decisively and with clear purpose. The fact that we have delayed the resolution of these key questions is undoubtedly a key factor as to why we went backwards in election 2019,\u201d Moakes writes.\n\nThe culture and ethos we once had and protected is in peril right now with care for and support of our colleagues often deprioritised by a toxic, abnormal environment\n\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that I have witnessed this sense of care being slowly eroded by some over the past number of years. I am enough of a realist to know that a political party will always be an environment of vigorous debate and contestation where internal politics will often rival the intensity of external political contests. The culture and ethos we once had and protected is in peril right now with care for and support of our colleagues often deprioritised by a toxic, abnormal environment. Internal fights, breaking of trust, disunity and inability to manage internal issues inside the party have become the norm.\u201d\n\nMoakes says that in order to rebuild the party needs to align itself around a shared vision, to do away with internal fighting, and\u201d firm and decisive leadership.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant amount of work to be done and it needs to start as soon as possible. Despite our current electoral situation, we have a great opportunity to retain existing governments in 2021 and win more municipalities. But this will require unity of purpose and a strong external focus. It is my sincere belief that if the party focuses as it should, momentum can be reclaimed and a path towards national government can begin to be forged again with positive results in the next local government elections. We still have a solid and stable foundation for future growth. And if we retain what makes us successful, discard what holds us back and continue to improve and embrace the value of innovation, we can only grow from strength to strength.\u201d", "description": "The DA\u2019s head of elections Jonathan Moakes has formally announced his resignation from the party.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8914/f7cc64102cfc42b6b33735cec48e656d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-24"}
