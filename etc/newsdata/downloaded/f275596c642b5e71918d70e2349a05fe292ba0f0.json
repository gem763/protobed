This could encourage more loans in the future.\n\nThe report added, however, that the United States also has a desire to maintain a presence in Venezuela's oil industry in case of a political transition.\n\nChevron has been present in Venezuela for nearly 100 years. It opened its Caracas office in 1923, and first struck oil at the Boscan field in 1946.\n\nThe Trump administration has several times imposed sanctions on Venezuela and sought to limit PDVSA's transactions to largely cut off Maduro's access to oil revenues, which account for most of the South American country's hard currency income.\n\nChevron and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment late on Friday.\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "description": "(Reuters) - The United States is considering extending Chevron Corp's <CVX.N> waiver to operate in Venezuela with more limitations by granting the company a 90-day sanctions reprieve, Bloomberg reported late on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
