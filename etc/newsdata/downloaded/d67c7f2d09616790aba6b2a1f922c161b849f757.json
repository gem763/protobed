Judging by the response to the film at the Toronto International Film Festival, the wait was worth it.\n\n\u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d drew some of the best reviews of Murphy\u2019s career, following the film\u2019s premiere over the weekend in Toronto.\n\nIt had been a while. Murphy\u2019s last two leading performances - 2016\u2019s \u201cMr. Church\u201d and 2012\u2019s \u201cA Thousand Words\u201d - were little seen and little loved.\n\nBut \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d was a passion project for the 58-year-old comedian. He long ago met with Moore, who died in 2008 at the age of 81, to discuss making a movie about the comedian. Moore\u2019s famous character - the straight-talking, kung fu-fighting pimp Dolemite - was his stand-up persona and star of the 1975 Blaxploitation classic \u201cDolemite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never let go of the idea. It was always something I thought could be a great movie. I had been sitting on the couch. I took some time to do nothing,\u201d Murphy said in an interview. \u201cIt goes back to when Rudy was alive. I literally went to see him at a club. It just didn\u2019t come together. And there was no Netflix back then.\u201d\n\n\u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d directed by Craig Brewer (\u201cHustle & Flow\u201d), will be released by Netflix in theaters Oct. 4 and begin streaming on Oct. 25. It\u2019s penned by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who memorably wrote another tale about an inexpert filmmaker: \u201cEd Wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d chronicles the ramshackle, threadbare making of \u201cDolemite\u201d with Wesley Snipes playing director D\u2019Urville Martin. It\u2019s a paean to low-budget moviemaking and a celebration of creating something out of nothing, outside a movie system that made scant room for African-American stories.\n\nFor Brewer, a Memphis, Tennessee, native, it\u2019s a testament to the independent filmmaking of his youth.\n\n\u201cI came up in my career as a guerrilla filmmaker. You show up and you shoot. You don\u2019t have permits. You don\u2019t have professionals help you. You just have a bunch of other people like you who have a blind passion,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cSometimes those passion projects turn into something wonderful even though they\u2019re terrible.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cMy Name Is Dolemite,\u201d the reception in Toronto was electric - especially for a performance that for many recalled Murphy\u2019s performances of the \u201880s. During the standing ovation that followed the film\u2019s premiere, cast member Keegan-Michael Key suggested the lengthy applause shouldn\u2019t stop for Murphy. \u201c\n\nWe should just stand all night and clap for him,\u201d Key said.\n\nThe film has helped kick off a comeback for Murphy. After years of working seldom if at all, Murphy is currently shooting a sequel to \u201cComing to America,\u201d also with Brewer directing and Snipes co-starring. Later this year, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmember will host the show for the first time since 1984. And after years away from the stage, he\u2019s plotting a return to stand-up, with a tour planned for next summer.\n\nBut before all that, Murphy was again performing stand-up, only as Rudy Ray Moore and outfitted in the costumes designed by Oscar-winner Ruth Carter for \u201cMy Name Is Dolemite.\u201d The filmmakers recognized what a privileged sight they were watching.\n\n\u201cEddie comes in as Rudy and he starts telling jokes. And like Eddie does, he goes completely off book. If something comes, he just rolls into it,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cThen he left and I turned to the audience and said, \u2018Y\u2019all, do you realize what just happened? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done that in like years! Decades!\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It took Eddie Murphy more than a decade to get a movie made about Rudy Ray Moore.
