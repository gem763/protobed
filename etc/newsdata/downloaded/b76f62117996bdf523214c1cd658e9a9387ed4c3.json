But he never let financial troubles stand in the way of his dream of winning an Olympic medal.\n\nBlack, now 53, has made more money in retirement than he ever did as an athlete.\n\nAlong with fellow Olympian Steve Backley, he has put money in property and created an investment training brand called Perform in Property.\n\nHe lives in a \u00a31.6million five-bedroom house in Guildford, Surrey, with his wife Jules, 51, and their twins Max and George, 13, as well as his daughter Isabelle, 19.\n\nRoger Black, now 53, lives in a \u00a31.6million five-bedroom house in Guildford, Surrey\n\nWhat did your parents teach you about money?\n\nI don't know if my parents ever sat down and talked to me about money. My father was a GP while mother was a nurse and receptionist at my father's practice.\n\nEven though we were comfortably off, my father always worried about money. Apparently, when my parents bought their house for \u00a39,000, he lay in bed that night and worried he would never be able to pay off the mortgage.\n\nThey lived within their means and encouraged me to save regularly. As a result, I've always saved and I've never been in debt.\n\nWhat was the first paid work you ever did?\n\nI was a chorister in my local church from the age of seven. I did the service on a Sunday and went to rehearsals twice a week. I got paid \u00a32.50 a month plus a bit extra when we sang at weddings. I spent it on sweets and comics.\n\nHave you ever struggled to make ends meet?\n\nYes, when I broke my foot in 1989. I had success in athletics quite quickly after I left school at 18. By the time I was 20 I had won the European Championships and was earning \u00a360,000 a year. So I bought a house for \u00a3150,000 \u2013 and then I broke my foot.\n\nI was out of the sport for over a year, and the interest rate on my mortgage was 13 per cent. I ran out of money and had to borrow \u00a310,000 from an anonymous benefactor who helped athletes. I managed to come back and win the European Championships in 1990. I got a \u00a310,000 bonus and paid my benefactor back even though he didn't want me to.\n\nGolden years: Roger after his World Championship 400m relay win in 1991\n\nDid your financial troubles end there?\n\nNo. A few years later I got glandular fever and had to sell my house for \u00a3130,000 \u2013 some \u00a320,000 less than I had bought it for. Unfortunately, you can't make any money as a runner if you can't run.\n\nIt was a stressful time, but what pushed me through was that I never let go of my dream of one day standing on an Olympic rostrum. It did not matter that I had to sell my house or get into debt. I would have done whatever it took financially to fulfil that dream \u2013 and I did.\n\nHave you ever been paid silly money?\n\nNo. I've earned good money for TV adverts, but I wouldn't call it silly because you're being paid for the use of your Olympic medal and your image.\n\nThe most memorable was a dog food advert at the height of my fame in 1996 when I won a silver medal in the Olympics. They paid me thousands of pounds \u2013 and took up little of my time. They filmed me with my dog and there was one shot that was supposed to be me and my dog running, but in the end they used stunt doubles for both of us. They said my actual dog wasn't fast enough to be in the advert.\n\nWhat was the best year of your financial life?\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt 2012. I made more money in retirement than I ever did as an athlete. I built up a business doing corporate speaking and development work with Steve Backley, the javelin thrower.\n\nBlack built up a business doing corporate speaking and development work with Steve Backley, the javelin thrower (pictured)\n\nIn 2012 we were able to work with some major sponsors of the London Olympics at events for their clients. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because the Olympics were in this country. We would speak at Olympic-themed events and interview young athletes on stage or attend dinners with their clients and chat to them about the Olympics. We were busy and I made a six-figure sum that year.\n\nWhat is the most expensive thing you bought for fun?\n\nIt was a special limited edition Olympic watch that Omega brought out in 2012. It cost \u00a33,000. I've worn it every day of my life since and I enjoy doing so.\n\nWhat is your biggest money mistake?\n\nInvesting in dotcom stocks in the run-up to 2000. I didn't get out quickly enough when the bubble burst and lost about \u00a3100,000. Since then, I have invested in the stock market, but more sensibly.\n\nThe best money decision you have made?\n\nGrowing and diversifying my businesses. As well as doing corporate speaking and television work, I have a licensing deal with Argos for a range of bikes and treadmills. Along with Steve, I am involved with a big global company that trains people to be property investors.\n\nDo you save into a pension?\n\nYes. The best financial advice I was ever given was to put \u00a35,000 into a pension when I was 20 years old. My accountant told me to do it. I haven't religiously invested into it over the years so it's not huge but it is better than not having anything. I buy managed investment funds or vehicles that track specific stock markets. I don't think picking stocks is a good use of my time. I would rather pay someone else to make those decisions, good or bad.\n\nBlack likes going away for weekends in Cornwall three or four times a year\n\nDo you own any property?\n\nYes. Home is a five-bedroom house in Guildford, Surrey which I bought a year and a half ago. It cost \u00a31.6million. Steve and I also have a little property investment portfolio which I see as part of my pension. Some are in Manchester and Leeds and there's one down in Folkestone, Kent.\n\nWhat little luxury do you treat yourself to?\n\nGoing away for weekends in Cornwall three or four times a year. The kids go surfing and we stay in a nice hotel.\n\nIf you were Chancellor what would you do?\n\nI would introduce a rule so that everyone who pays income tax would have a say over where a small share of that money \u2013 say 5 per cent \u2013 is spent.\n\nI think that would make people feel they have a degree of control. But I would be careful to offer people quite a narrow choice. I would want to make sure that everything essential was adequately funded.\n\nDo you donate money to charity?\n\nYes, I think it's important. I support Cystic Fibrosis Trust because I have a nephew with cystic fibrosis and also the British Heart Foundation because I have heart disease.\n\nI was born with a leaking heart valve. I see a specialist every year and have done since I was 11.", "description": "Former sprinter Roger Black struggled to pay his mortgage.
