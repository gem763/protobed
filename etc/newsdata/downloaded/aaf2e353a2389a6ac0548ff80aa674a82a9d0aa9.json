Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair, who pushed the invasion.\n\nBut Blair hailed Chirac on Thursday as \"a towering figure in French and European politics over many decades\".\n\nHis death was announced by his son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux, who told AFP he had died on Thursday morning at his home in Paris \"surrounded by his family, peacefully\".\n\nThe presidency said well-wishers will also be able to offer condolences at the Elysee Palace on Thursday until Sunday.\n\nMixed legacy\n\nChirac's death prompted intense discussions about Chirac's legacy to France, with commentators united in admiration of his wily political skills and homely style, but divided on what he achieved.\n\nAs a student he had been a Communist party activist, and as a right-leaning politician he was known for his ideological flexibility, with economic policies that fluctuated - as did his views on European integration.\n\nWhile he was hailed for standing up to the far right - he defeated the National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen for his 2002 re-election - he was also capable of fuelling France's deep-rooted racial tensions.\n\n\"Having Spaniards, Poles and Portuguese people working here creates fewer problems than having Muslims and blacks,\" he said in a speech in 1991.\n\nHis legacy is also overshadowed by a conviction for graft dating to his time as mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.\n\nAfter losing his presidential immunity, he become the first former head of state to go on trial in 2011 and was given a suspended jail term.\n\n\"He's someone with a mixed record,\" political historian and author Jean Garrigues told AFP, adding that there was \"a large reserve of goodwill towards him from the French people\".\n\nThe beer-loving charmer, whose extramarital affairs were an open secret, had barely been seen in public in recent years. He suffered a stroke in 2005 and underwent kidney surgery in December 2013.\n\n'Embodied France'\n\nChirac's 12 years in the Elysee Palace made him France's second longest-serving postwar president, after his Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand.\n\n\"Jacques Chirac is part of the history of France,\" said parliament speaker Richard Ferrand from Macron's centrist party as he announced Chirac's death to parliament.\n\nMacron's Socialist predecessor Francois Hollande praised Chirac as a \"fighter\" who had \"known how to establish a personal link with the French\".\n\nPutin heaped praise on Chirac as a \"wise and far-sighted statesman\" and also singled out \"his intellect and huge knowledge\", the Kremlin said.\n\nMerkel said he was \"an outstanding partner and friend to us Germans\" while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Chirac had \"shaped the destiny of his nation\".\n\n'Honest man'\n\nIt was Chirac's time at the helm of the French capital that resulted in his conviction in December 2011 for embezzlement and misuse of public funds.\n\nHe contested the ruling but did not appeal it, saying the French people \"know who I am: an honest man\" who worked only for \"the grandeur of France and for peace\".\n\nA politician with a popular touch who loved the company of farmers, Chirac also deployed his charm and acid tongue on supporters and foes.\n\nCaught on an open mic discussing Britain with his German and Russian counterparts in 2005, he was famously overheard saying that \"one cannot trust people whose cuisine is so bad\".\n\nDespite his long marriage to Bernadette, he was also known for dalliances with other women which were an open secret to many.\n\nHe said just before leaving office: \"There have been women I have loved a lot, as discreetly as possible.\"", "description": "Former French president Jacques Chirac died on Thursday at the age of 86 after a long battle with ill-health, his family said, prompting tributes from across the political spectrum for a charismatic statesman who famously said \"non\" to the 2003 Iraq war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9406/8d7aedbb192d487aa04849eb0de88e37.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
