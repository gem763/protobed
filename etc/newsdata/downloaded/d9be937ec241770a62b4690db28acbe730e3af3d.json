The stricken vessel has been named as the Sabity, according to the state-run IRNA news agency, citing Iran\u2019s National Iranian Tanker Co.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX19, +2.00% climbed $1.07, or 2%, to $54.60 a barrel, while the global benchmark, December Brent crude BRNZ19, +2.06% jumped 98 cents, or 1.7%, to $60.10 a barrel.\n\nPotential for renewed conflict in the Middle East was clearly a fresh driver for investors Friday. Reports of the Iran tanker blast come amid allegations that the country has been behind attacks in recent months on oil tankers close to the Strait of Hormuz.
