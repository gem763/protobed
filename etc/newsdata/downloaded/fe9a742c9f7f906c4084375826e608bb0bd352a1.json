The Sun initially did not accept the article, from a freelance reporter, was inaccurate and said it was a faithful report of concerns raised by staff.\n\nIt said the article quoted sources saying the parking changes were not attributable to the royal couple. But following complaints from the duke and duchess, the article was removed from its website.\n\nThe newspaper offered to publish an apology on page two of the paper and online that referenced the article, and said: \u201cWe now accept that the parking changes were not requested by the duke and duchess. We are happy to correct the record and apologise for any distress caused.\u201d\n\nThe royal couple rejected this measure, saying the apology should feature on the Sun\u2019s front page.\n\nIpso must be UK\u2019s de facto press regulator Read more\n\nIn its ruling, the Ipso complaints committee said that, while it was not in dispute an area of the car park was no longer available for staff parking after 1 April, the Sun\u2019s story had relied on staff sources speculating on the role of the royal couple in the changes.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cThe publication had not provided any direct evidence of the complainants\u2019 involvement in the decision.\n\n\u201cIn these circumstances, and where the complainants\u2019 position had been made clear to the publication in advance of the article being published, there was a failure to take care over the presentation as fact of the claim that they had \u2018imposed\u2019 the ban.\u201d\n\nThe committee also said the article front page headline was a \u201cplay on words\u201d which, in isolation, did not suggest the royal couple were behind the parking changes.\n\nIt noted it was \u201cnot misleading\u201d for the article to report a \u201cban\u201d by an employee of the royal household and that the royal couple\u2019s denial of involvement had been included.\n\nIt therefore deemed a front page correction was not necessary and that the newspaper\u2019s previous page two clarification and apology offer was sufficient.", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have received an apology from the paper after press regulator ruling", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc12227f924d8ccf3e4be1ade65ebd1ac387924/0_56_3290_1975/master/3290.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a8234a24ee061874f21f53de338bf12", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
