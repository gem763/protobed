There wasn\u2019t even a joke,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"The punchline was just dead naming her and then the bit ended. It was super uncomfortable for the audience.\"\n\n\"@nbcsnl Michael Che, I\u2019m disappointed in your comparison of Kanye West, a cis man, to Caitlyn Jenner, a trans woman. Your comparison implies that trans women are just men who change their names. You also misgendered and deadnamed her,\" another user wrote. \"Both of these things are extremely harmful, widespread practices that contribute to the oppression of trans women, and the trans community at large. I want you to apologize for this behavior. You are better than this.\"\n\nCaitlyn Jenner was deadnamed and misgendered as a punchline. There wasn\u2019t even a joke.
