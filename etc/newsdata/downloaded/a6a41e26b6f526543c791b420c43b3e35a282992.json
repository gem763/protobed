As revealed in the film, which was released today in the U.S., Smith\u2019s character admits to her granddaughter Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) that she\u2019s quite ill, with little time to live, but who knows how accurate that is \u2014 a London doctor diagnosed her, after all. (Her words, not ours.) Should we ever witness the grand spectacle of a Violet Crawley funeral, though, Downton creator Julian Fellowes knows exactly how he\u2019d like to see it unfold, and he filled Vulture in with his ideas at the film\u2019s NYC premiere earlier this week. \u201cThere was funeral about five years ago for the Duchess of Devonshire, and they had all of the workers of the Chatsworth Estate walking along behind her coffin,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was all quite powerful and moving, particularly in 2014. I loved that they felt that loyalty to her to make that procession. I suppose we would do something like that.\u201d\n\nFellowes also told Vulture that the idea of a Dowager Countess funeral was floated around for the current Downton film, but only if Smith chose not to reprise her role. Luckily, it was an easy yes from her, so that poignant conversation between her and Dockery\u2019s characters was written as the focal point instead. \u201cI don\u2019t think we thought in terms of a death scene. When I wondered if Maggie would do the film, we thought in terms of a very grand funeral, because that would be another way of writing her out,\u201d Fellowes added. \u201cI was very, very pleased she said she would do it.\u201d As are we.", "description": "Julian Fellowes revealed how he would film the funeral of one of Downton Abbey\u2019s most beloved characters, should it happen on-screen.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-julian-fellowes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
