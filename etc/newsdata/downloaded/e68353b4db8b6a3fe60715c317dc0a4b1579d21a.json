Revenue was slightly below forecasts, but Delta's bottom line was helped by strong demand growth which prompted it to hire more pilots, flight attendants, and airport workers.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2013 The housewares retailer named Target Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton as its new chief executive officer, succeeding interim CEO Mary Winston. His appointment is effective November 4.\n\nCostco \u2013 The retailer reported September comparable-store sales of 4.2%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 3.8%.\n\nPG&E \u2013 The utility's shares are under pressure after a judge ruled that a rival bankruptcy plan from Elliott Management and other bondholders could be considered. The ruling stripped PG&E of an exclusive right to propose a chapter 11 recovery plan.\n\nGeneral Motors \u2013 GM reported a 17.5% decline in third-quarter China vehicle sales, hurt by the ongoing trade war, a slower economy, and increased competition.\n\nT-Mobile US, Sprint \u2013 Mississippi dropped its legal challenge to the proposed $26.5 billion merger between the wireless carriers. That follows an agreement between the two sides which, among other things, will expand high-speed internet access to the state's rural areas.", "description": "These are the stocks posting the largest moves before the bell.", "authors": ["Peter Schacknow", "Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106086204-1566231340188rtx71ykr.jpg?v=1566231402", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
