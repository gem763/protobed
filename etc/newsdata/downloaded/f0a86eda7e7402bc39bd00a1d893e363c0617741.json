Police had earlier spoken to the man using a drone.\n\n\"Recent works have been undertaken on the chimney building by a specialist contractor working on our behalf. The maintenance work was completed prior to the incident,\" a council spokesman told Mail Online .\n\n\"The site is secure and is surrounded by a walled and gated compound.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"There is no direct access to the chimney from ground level. The ladders which are currently attached to the structure are temporary and were installed by the contractor to facilitate access to complete the maintenance repairs.\n\n\"These start from a height of 15 foot above the ground. We are working with our specialist contractor to remove the ladders.\n\n\"We are continuing to support the Police with their investigations and our thoughts are with those affected by the incident at this sad time.\"\n\nThe man was finally retrieved from the chimney after 14 hours, but police tragically confirmed he was pronounced dead at 4.45pm.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA police officer remained by the scene of the incident this morning as well-wishers left flowers and cards in memory of the man.\n\nMeanwhile, officers have launched an investigation into how and why the man climbed up the listed structure.\n\nResults of their inquiry will be passed on to the Coroner, the force said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA spokesman from Carlisle East fire station said: \"Thank you to the people of Carlisle, for their patience and understanding, whilst our crews were working as part of an extremely complex and challenging incident at Dixon\u2019s Chimney, Carlisle.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with the gentleman\u2019s family and friends at this sad time.\"\n\nA Cumbria Police spokesman said: \"The thoughts of all the emergency services and partners are with the family and friends of the man.\n\n\"Specialist welfare police officers are supporting his family at this difficult time.\"", "description": "The man, who was in his 50s, got stuck dangling upside down on Dixons Chimney in Carlisle, Cumbria", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Pa", "News", "Star", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750327.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chimney-rescue.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
