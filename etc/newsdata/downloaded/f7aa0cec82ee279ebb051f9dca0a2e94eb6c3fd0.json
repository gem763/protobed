Now as we see the end-markets slow, we are reducing the dealer inventories by $400 million in the quarter,\" Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfie said.\n\nChief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said demand in the fourth quarter is expected to be flat. Total sales and revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 5.6% to $12.76 billion.\n\n\"Sales in Asia/Pacific were lower across most of the region primarily due to lower demand in China, including unfavorable changes in dealer inventories, amid continued competitive pressures,\" the company said.\n\nCaterpillar sales have improved since the company managed to halt a four-year slide in 2016, but Wall Street analysts have been warning that demand in more than half of its end markets had peaked and Wednesday's numbers also showed sales in North America fell 3%.\n\nThe company is seen as one of Wall Street's clearer gauges of the state of Chinese demand, and its impact on big western multinationals.\n\nCaterpillar said the impact of tariffs imposed on its goods as a result of President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing would now be lower than the $250 million to $350 million range it gave earlier this year.\n\nBut it also cut its 2019 expectations for profit to between $10.90 and $11.40 per share, compared with a previous estimate of $12.06 to $13.06.\n\nProfit attributable to common stockholders fell to $1.49 billion, or $2.66 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $1.73 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected Caterpillar to earn $2.88 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "Caterpillar cuts profit outlook as China sales slump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M0UU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
