Pyongyang also urged Tokyo to take steps to prevent a recurrence.\n\nJapan termed the claims \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\nA Japanese Coast Guard patrol ship that arrived following the incident did not question North Korean crew members about the collision, prompting both ruling and opposition parties to demand release of the footage.\n\nThe Japanese government was initially reluctant to release it but shifted the policy aiming to show the Okuni's actions were appropriate.\n\nThe original four-hour footage was edited to show just 13 minutes of the incident.\n\nThe collision occurred some 350 kilometers northwest of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture, an area near fertile fishing waters, especially for squid.\n\nThe area has seen a rise in illegal fishing by North Korean and Chinese ships, and Japanese authorities have been stepping up their patrols.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "The government released video footage Friday showing last week's collision between a Japanese patrol ship and a North Korean fishing vessel in an effort to demonstrate that Japan took appropriate action.
