It is believed that Johnson could win the first vote but lose the second, because MPs want more time to scrutinize it.\n\nBut Johnson told the Commons this afternoon: \u201cI will in no way allow months more of this.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this. And with great regret I must say that the bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward \u2026 to a general election.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street official confirmed that the government will pull the bill if MPs vote the timetable down and the EU accepts the delay that Johnson requested on Saturday night.\n\nJohnson will push for an election before Christmas. But he would need opposition MPs to vote for it, either in a motion in the Commons or through a no-confidence vote.", "description": "Boris Johnson is expected to lose a crucial vote in the House of Commons.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176827789-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
