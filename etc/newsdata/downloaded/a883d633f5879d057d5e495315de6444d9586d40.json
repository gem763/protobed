No wonder such a high proportion of issues go unreported.\"\n\nHer experience echoes that of Lily Allen, who recently told the BBC her record label had failed to act on accusations of sexual assault by an industry figure.\n\nThe Musicians' Union said many artists affected by harassment end up leaving the industry while the perpetrators face little recrimination.\n\nIt asked its 30,000 members whether they had experienced discrimination or abuse at work. Of the 725 who responded, nearly half (48%) said they had.\n\n\"It ranges from things like a professional musician turning up for a gig and being given hot pants to wear, to backstage facilities that are only really designed for men, to abuse and rape,\" said Pohl.\n\nShe added that harassment was rife in the music industry because it presented a \"very informal working environment, with late nights and alcohol consumption at gigs\" as well as \"working one-on-one in a studio environment, and places with no windows\".\n\n\"Survivors are often unable to speak out because the consequences for their career or personal life are devastating,\" said Pohl.\n\nMore than half of the surveyed musicians felt the culture of the industry was the greatest barrier to reporting abuse, with other factors including fear of losing work and expectations the issue would not be handled appropriately.\n\nThe Union says its members are particularly vulnerable because they tend to work on a freelance basis, meaning they have fewer protections than those in fixed employment.\n\nIt is calling on the government to extend the Equality Act's provisions on discrimination and harassment so that they cover self-employed workers; and is asking the public to sign a petition calling for freelancers to be given \"an equal level of protection to those in fixed employment\".\n\nIn response, a Government Equalities Office spokeswoman said: \"Sexual harassment is appalling and it must be stopped.\n\n\"Our consultation on how the current laws can be improved closed at the beginning of this month and we are carefully considering all of the responses we received.\n\n\"We proposed a number of measures to strengthen and clarify the law so that we can provide explicit protections to anyone who experiences this vile behaviour in the workplace.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
