The designation is nothing more than \u201can attempt to stop our activities,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD\n\nNavalny, who has become the most prominent Russian critic of President Vladimir Putin, himself tweeted, \u201cFBK has never received a kopeck of foreign money. All of FBK\u2019s money comes from your donations (from citizens of the Russian Federation). The actions of the Ministry of Justice are absolutely illegal and, obviously, by direct order of Putin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn another tweet, he demanded that the Justice Ministry make public any evidence of foreign donations it might have.\n\nThe foundation and its staff members were subjected to repeated police raids during the summer, at the height of the street protests over Moscow\u2019s city elections, over allegations that it was engaged in money laundering. Yarmish and Navalny categorically deny that charge as well.\n\nAD\n\nNavalny was a leader of those protests \u2014 except for the many weeks he spent in detention as Moscow authorities repeatedly had him and many of his allies held on administrative charges.\n\nHis political work is separate from the Anti-Corruption Foundation, but Russian officials have not paid much attention to that distinction.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Interior Ministry announced that the Moscow police department is suing Navalny and other protest organizers for leading unsanctioned protests on July 27 and Aug. 3. The police are seeking $278,000 in damages, as compensation for the costs they incurred.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe claimant requests compensation for the damage inflicted by deploying forces and equipment to ensure public order during unauthorized mass events,\u201d a police spokesperson told the Tass news agency.\n\nAD\n\nThose protest rallies were marked by some of the most brutal police crackdowns Moscow has experienced in many years, and thousands were detained. The police response was seen by many as a signal that protest would no longer be tolerated by Putin\u2019s government.\n\nPublic reaction to the crackdown, however, was negative according to polls and by the end of the summer the police had mostly backed off.\n\nThe criminal case, the damage-seeking lawsuit and now the \u201cforeign agent\u201d designation seem to suggest that the Kremlin is now moving to stymie the opposition by less physical means.\n\nSeventy-one organizations have been listed as foreign agents since the law was enacted, and it has largely made it impossible for them to keep working in any effective manner.\n\nAD", "description": "An official designation as \u201cforeign agent\u201d for Alexei Navalny\u2019s group will likely hobble it.", "authors": ["Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IwwfIoXC0y1cgKXA9OpWhgm3jJg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZZRQI5HKQQI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
