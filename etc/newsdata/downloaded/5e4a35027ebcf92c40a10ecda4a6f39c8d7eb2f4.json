Nazanin Tabatabaee/ WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nA U.S. payrolls report on the private sector showed a lower-than-expected figure for September, but market participants were relieved the data was not as bad as many initially feared especially in the wake of poor U.S. manufacturing numbers.\n\nData from the U.S. payrolls processor ADP showed that U.S. private sector jobs totaled 135,000 last month, lower than the 140,000 consensus forecast.\n\nThe dollar initially trimmed losses against the yen and euro after the U.S. jobs data.\n\n\u201cWith the ADP report, the initial reaction was mild relief that the numbers weren\u2019t worse because yesterday the horrible ISM (manufacturing) data had a pretty weak employment component,\u201d said Erik Bregar, director and head of FX strategy at Exchange Bank of Canada in Toronto.\n\n\u201cBut that initial move is fading now. Arguably, something is not right here. The U.S. ISM report proved that and I really wonder when the Fed\u2019s going to stop pretending that everything is okay,\u201d he added.\n\nU.S. manufacturing contracted at the fastest pace in more than a decade in September, making the United States the latest country to suffer a manufacturing downturn amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nMany analysts, however, say the dollar\u2019s higher yield and the relative strength of the U.S. economy should make its setback temporary. Non-farm payrolls data due on Friday should give more insight into the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn morning trading, the dollar fell 0.3% against the yen to 107.39 yen JPY=, reflecting investor demand for safer assets after the manufacturing data heightened concerns about the health of the global economy.\n\nThe euro rose 0.1% against the dollar to $1.0944 EUR= but was above Tuesday's two-year low of $1.0879.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback\u2019s value against a basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 99.13 .DXY after reaching 99.667 on Tuesday, a 29-month peak, before the manufacturing data was released.\n\nMichael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets in London said weakness in U.S. manufacturing would have to spill over into services before it had much impact on monetary policy and the outlook for the dollar.\n\nElsewhere, the Australian dollar fell 0.2% to US$0.6696 AUD=D3, its weakest since early 2009, as investors sold currencies linked to the outlook of the global economy. The Aussie fell to a fresh 10-year trough on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates to a record low on Tuesday.\n\nThe pound was down 0.1% at $1.2290 GBP=D3 amid doubt over whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's final Brexit offer to the European Union would be well-received by Brussels.", "description": "The dollar dropped against the euro and yen on Wednesday, in line with falls in equities and Treasury yields, amid worries about global growth following data a day earlier that showed a sharp decline in U.S. manufacturing activity.", "authors": ["Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436286010&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9117E"}
