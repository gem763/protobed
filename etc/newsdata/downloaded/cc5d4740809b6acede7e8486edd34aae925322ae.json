Hundreds of homes had been flooded. And thousands were without power Friday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s emotionally draining,\u201d said Rebecca Gay, 41, who had been caring for a friend who was displaced for more than a year after Harvey, before getting stranded again this week. Her friend had not been able to return home to see whether her rebuilt house had survived.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to see me crying,\u201d Gay said, tearing up. \u201cShe\u2019s still got some trauma from Harvey. She\u2019s very fragile. We\u2019re just trying to take it easy and keep it light.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, officials in the Houston area were scrambling to control barges that broke loose and struck a bridge that carries traffic across the San Jacinto River. Concerned about possible structural damage to the bridge, officials shut down Interstate 10 in both directions.\n\nHouston public schools were closed Friday, but the district was facing a blowback for not canceling classes a day earlier.\n\nAs the worst from Imelda blew through on Thursday, parents complained that they were forced to commute in dangerous flooding conditions, even as the mayor was urging people to stay off the roads. They took to the district\u2019s Facebook page to describe chaotic after-school conditions: children wandering the flooded streets, parents wading through thigh-high water with pre-schoolers on their backs, students and administrators sleeping overnight at school. \u201cTotal disaster,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nBy Friday, roads were still closed, routines were disrupted and people were struggling to get to work across southeast Texas. Some, like Charlotte Kinsey, were sick with worry over missing family members.\n\nRead more\n\nPeople warned to stay indoors as storm Imelda brings \u2018extreme\u2019 floods\n\nKinsey fled her three-bedroom trailer home in Winnie, Texas, on Thursday afternoon as the floodwaters rose around her and her 3-week-old daughter, Niomi Grace Galley. But she had not heard from her 17-year-old son, Trevor Coffey, who had not been seen since he returned from a job interview late Wednesday. Adding to her concerns, Trevor has a mental health diagnosis that requires medication, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he can\u2019t swim.\u201d\n\nEven being at the shelter reminded her of Trevor: They had evacuated together to the same shelter in the same event center in Anahuac, Texas, two years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is Harvey all over again and we barely made it out the last time,\u201d Kinsey said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about going to my mother\u2019s in Colorado. I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m not putting my kids through this anymore.\u201d", "description": "As the remnants of the former Tropical Storm Imelda moved north on Friday, residents in southeast Texas awoke to shut down roads, scattered thunderstorms and the possibility of more flooding from a storm that became one the top 10 wettest in U.S. history.The storm that had barely earned a name \u2014 it briefly", "authors": ["Manny Fernandez", "Sarah Mervosh", "Mitchell Ferman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TVJZsWwM4DI70_TW2zgNIg--~B/aD0zMzk7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/95d71ab06e9e455a48441197ed647e8c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
