Others have obtained letters from doctors and submitted them under seal,' reports The New York Times.\n\n'Some have pointed to the losses they have already suffered \u2014 of high-paying or fulfilling jobs, of once-sterling reputations \u2014 to make a case for lesser punishments.'\n\nReal special: Devin Sloane (above last month) came with a proposal for a new program where private school children would play games with their disabled peers at his hearing last month\n\nDevin Sloane came equipped with a proposal for a new program where private school children would play games with their disabled peers at his hearing last month.\n\nHe told the court that his program was promoting ' the values of inclusion, anti-bullying and diversity directly to the independent school children, who are the focus of this case.'\n\nOnce he had finished speaking, Mr Sloane was informed that his remarks were 'about as tone-deaf as I\u2019ve heard' by Judge Indira Talwani.\n\nShe then sentenced him to four months behind bars.\n\nAnother attempt at this backfired when Stephen Semprevivo brought in his very own criminologist, a move that is compelled legal.\n\nIt was during this appearance that Judge Talwani made it clear just how little shwe cared for the practice.\n\n'I maybe should say to you, before I get nine more of these: I don\u2019t feel I need an expert report from a criminologist to tell me how to rule here, particularly where it\u2019s the same criminologist that\u2019s going to be probably presenting for everybody in L.A ,' said Judge Talwani.\n\n'Prosecutors in the admissions case have tried their best to turn the defendants\u2019 sentencing presentations against them, suggesting that they point to a lack of contrition and a determination to avoid punishment,' reports the Times.\n\n'It appeared that some parents were getting the message that introducing extensive consultants\u2019 reports could backfire. Materials submitted by defendants scheduled to be sentenced in the coming days appeared more restrained than those handed in for earlier parents.\n\n'In some cases, the defendants and their lawyers even underscored their decision to reject expert help.'\n\nTalwani-ing like it is: Judge Indira Talwani (above) waited until one parent had finished speaking, and then said his idea was 'about as tone-deaf as I\u2019ve heard'\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors are continuing to move forward with new cases.\n\nXiaoning Sui, 48, a Chinese national who lives in British Columbia, was charged just last month.\n\nShe is accused of paying $400,000 to gain her son admission to UCLA as a soccer player with the help of Laura Janke.\n\nThe former soccer coach at USC was previously charged for helping write fake profiles for the children of defendants including Lori Loughlin.\n\nThe complaint, which was obtained by DailyMail.com, reveals that the young man was accepted to UCLA last year, and that his mother paid $100,000 in late 2018 and another $300,000 in February of this year - just weeks before the scandal made headlines around the world.\n\nThose payments all went to the Key Worldwide Foundation according to the complaint, but the second was later funneled to a soccer club controlled by Janke and Ali Khosroshahian.\n\nThis case does present one major hurdle for federal prosecutors however, because the defendant does not speak English.\n\nThe complaint states that her conversations with the scam's mastermind William Rick Singer and others always took place with a translator on the phone,\n\nIt is unclear if Sui's son had started at the institution this year, especially since this story was revealed months before the indictment by the Los Angeles Times, though the family was not named in that report.\n\nSui was arrested in Spain and officials are in the process for getting her extradited to Boston, where she was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in a federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday.\n\n'On or about October 24, 2018, Singer had a conference call with SUI, Recruiter 1 and a Chinese translator. In the conference call, Singer explained in English that he needed SUI to wire $100,000 to Singer's bank account, which would be \"paid to the coach at UCLA\" in exchange for a letter of intent from the coach recruiting Applicant 1 onto his soccer team,' states the complaint.\n\n'Singer further explained that the $100,000 would be paid to \"the UCLA men's soccer coach directly.\" The translator translated what Singer said into Chinese, telling SUI: \"Your son is admitted to this school through UCLA's soccer team. That $100,000 is directly transferred to that soccer coach. So, although your son is a tennis player, because there is a place in soccer team, so it is the soccer team that takes your son.\"'\n\nThe court filing then states: 'SUI responded, \"OK.\"'", "description": "A number of parents have reportedly hired consultants to help them draft the community service proposals and reference letters they are presenting in court at their sentencing hearings.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19314714-0-image-a-33_1570221730822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
