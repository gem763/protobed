He may get his wish. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan, has been negotiating with the Taliban for a nearly a year and is hopeful that the next round of talks will produce a \u201clasting and honorable\u201d peace agreement.\n\nWhile peace would be wonderful, the United States should not be too hasty in reaching a deal. Two of the Trump administration\u2019s top counterterrorism priorities\u2014defeating ISIS and preventing Afghanistan from once more becoming a hub of global terror\u2014are sometimes viewed as separate objectives. In fact, they are part of the same fight\u2014and that fight is complicated.\n\nFor starters, Al Qaeda and the Taliban aren\u2019t the only extremist groups operating in Afghanistan. More than twenty foreign terrorist organizations or organizations that have provided support to terrorists are active there. One of the worst is the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K), which is an Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State.\n\nWhen the organization was formed in January 2015, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi hand-pickedHafiz Saeed Khan to lead it. Khan was joined by Abdul Rauf, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee and member of the Taliban, who defected to al-Baghdadi\u2019s cause.\n\nThis leadership team did not last long. Both Rauf and Khan were killed in drone strikes; Rauf died in February 2015 and Khan died in July 2016. Yet the group was able to expand nonetheless. According to the United Nations, ISIS-K has the largest foreign fighter component of all the ISIS affiliates. Its troops, drawn from North Africa and Europe, the North Caucasus and South and Central Asia, now number between 2,500 and 5,000.\n\nISIS-K\u2019s targets have included NATO personnel, Shia worshippers, and the Taliban. According to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the group is responsible for one fifth of all civilian casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nISIS-K largely operates in eastern Afghanistan, primarily in the Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, which are close to the border of Pakistan. Yet it also reportedly has a presence in neighboring provinces of Nuristan and Laghman, as well as the capital city of Kabul, where it has launched attacks.\n\nNow, there are fears ISIS-K has broadened its ambitions. It has claimed attacks in neighboring Pakistan, and Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, recently stated that ISIS-K \u201chas aspirations to attack the United States.\u201d A U.S. intelligence official based in Afghanistan characterized this summer\u2019s attacks in Kabul as \u201cpractice runs\u201d for operations in the United States and Europe, which this official described as \u201cjust a matter of time.\u201d He also called ISIS-K \u201cthe most near-term threat to our homelands from Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThat threat may have already turned to action in Europe. In April 2017, an Uzbek called Rakhmat Akilov began mowing down civilians on the streets of Stockholm, Sweden. Akilov said he carried out his attack in order to \u201cbuild a caliphate according to Prophet Muhammad's prophecies.\u201d\n\nPrior to his attack, Akliov was in contact with a fellow Tajik called Abu Osama Noraki. Akilov identified Noraki as an ISIS emir. Noraki is suspected of recruiting Tajiks to the cause via the smartphone walkie-talkie app Zello.\n\nTrue, it has not all been smooth sailing for ISIS-K. A UN assessment this July concluded that, \u201cin 2019, ISIL-K suffered military setbacks and the intensity of its attacks lessened compared with previous periods.\u201d ISIS was also weakened by a military skirmish with the Taliban in the summer of 2018 in the province of Jowzjan in the country\u2019s north. This was erroneously claimed by the Pentagon to be a victory for Afghan security forces.\n\nThe good guys, too, have recorded some victories over ISIS-K. According to the Long War Journal, the United States has successfully targeted four ISIS-K emirs since July 2016. The latest was Abu Saad Orakzai, who was killed during an August 2018 airstrike in the Nangarhar Province.\n\nDespite this, ISIS-K presents an ongoing regional and, potentially, transnational threat. As it has grown in manpower (from hundreds at its founding to thousands today), it has expanded the territory it controls in Kunar. It operates in rugged, highly advantageous terrain and is aggressively recruiting from university campuses.\n\nPerhaps, once the United States withdraws, the Taliban will crush ISIS-K as part of a campaign to expand its influence in Afghanistan even further. When speaking as head of U.S. Central Command, Army Gen. Joseph L. Votel noted that \u201cISIS-K is not a popular insurgency in Afghanistan. Everybody is against them.\u201d Perhaps its presence in Afghanistan will prove to be fleeting.\n\nYet several observers have pointed out that if the United States does negotiate a durable peace settlement in Afghanistan, then it is possible that some of the most hardcore Taliban elements that want to carry on fighting may be drawn to the transnational jihadism of ISIS-K.\n\nEither way, any deal negotiated in Afghanistan must allow the United States to retain the ability to carry out counterterrorism operations there. After almost two decades of fighting, America\u2019s desire to wind down its efforts is understandable. Yet, as it does so, it cannot ignore the emergence of a group that aspires to inflict the kind of suffering on the United States that led it into Afghanistan in the first place.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u00a0wants out\u00a0of Afghanistan by 2020.
