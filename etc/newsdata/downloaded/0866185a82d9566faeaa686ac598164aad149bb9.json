Teaching his daughters where their eyes were and seeing the girls point to them for the first time was big.\n\nFallon is giving other parents the opportunity to craft their own educational moments with their children with his new book, \"This Is Baby.\" It follows two other children's books written by Fallon, \"Everything Is Mama\" and \"Your First Word Will Be Dada.\"\n\n\"This Is Baby,\" which goes on sale Tuesday, completes the family.\n\nThis Is Baby (Photo: Feiwel & Friends)\n\nFallon and his illustrator, Miguel Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, decided that for their third book, they would use illustrations of humans as opposed to illustrations of baby animals, which they'd used in the previous books.\n\nThat decision ignited an idea.\n\nFallon said he likes things that rhyme, such as \"eyes, nose, fingers, toes.\" So he thought it would be good to do a book that showed babies their body parts.\n\nAfter reading with your kids constantly, you start to see a lot of the same kinds of books, Fallon explained. He's always looking to do something different: \"This Is Baby\" is interactive. The book is formatted so parents can read it and interact with their child in whatever manner they choose.\n\n\"You can read it as fast as you want and as long as you want,\" he said. \"Sometimes as a tired parent, you just want to get through a book in 20 seconds.\"\n\nAnd as a parent, the exhaustion factor is very real, Fallon said. \"The bags under your eyes start taking up your whole face,\" he chuckled.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, you can spend an hour on one page of the book, if you want, asking your child such questions as \"How many arms do you have? Can you count them?\" Fallon explained.\n\n\"It's colorful and fun,\" Fallon said. \"You can add as many separate stories as you want to to each page to pass the time.\"\n\nThe payoff that comes with writing children's books, Fallon said, is huge.\n\n\"I did the first one as a joke, kind of a goof,\" he said. Then parents started sending in videos of their children reading the book back to them.\n\n\"People come up to me and they're like, 'My kid has been chewing on your book for the last four months.' They're not reading it but they're eating it,\" he chuckled again. \"I really love it, and I think you can get as creative as you want.\"\n\nThe process to create the books is quite long. Fallon said this book took about a year. This time, he had some assistance in his creative process.\n\nFallon left a copy of the book on his coffee table to see how his daughters, ages 4 and 6, would react to the book. If they didn't like it, he would make changes.\n\n\"I left it out on the table and was like, 'Oh, look at this book,' and they kind of read it to me,\" he said.\n\nThey loved it.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/07/jimmy-fallon-childrens-book-this-is-baby-interview/3824300002/", "description": "Jimmy Fallon, father of two and host of \"The Tonight Show,\" publishes his third children's book, \"This Is Baby.\"", "authors": ["Morgan Hines", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Vince Flynn", "Kyle Mills", "Rick Riordan", "Demi Moore", "Bill O'Reilly", "Published A.M.
