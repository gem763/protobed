Their drive was extended by a pair of third-down penalties on the Chiefs, one for a facemask personal foul and another for defensive holding. The Broncos, after an offside penalty on Kansas City, opted to try a two-point conversion but failed. (Broncos 6, Chiefs 0 with 9:06 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPreview:\n\nThe scrutiny of the Kansas City Chiefs and of the officiating will be intense when Week 7 of the NFL season gets underway Thursday night in Denver.\n\nThe Chiefs will face the Broncos and attempt to end a two-game losing streak that followed their 4-0 start to the season.\n\nIt was only a few weeks ago that it seemed relatively certain that the Chiefs were headed to an AFC title game rematch with the New England Patriots. Those teams appeared to be, by a fairly wide margin, the class of not only the AFC, but of the entire NFL. But while the Patriots remain unbeaten, the Chiefs have stumbled with consecutive home losses to the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans.\n\nAD\n\nQuarterback Patrick Mahomes is having another MVP-worthy season and the Chiefs benefited from speedster Tyreek Hill\u2019s return to the lineup against the Texans. He gives the Kansas City offense the biggest of big-play threats at wide receiver. But there are issues on defense. Opponents increasingly have been able to run the ball against the Kansas City defense to control the game and the clock and limit Mahomes\u2019s opportunities.\n\nAD\n\nChiefs at Broncos\n\nWhen: Thursday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Empower Field at Mile High in Denver\n\nTV: Fox, NFL Network\n\nStreaming: Amazon Prime, Yahoo Sports\n\nThe Chiefs are ranked 30th in the league in run defense and 27th in total defense. They don\u2019t need to have an overpowering defense, not with the exploits of their fast-break offense and the playmaking mastery of Mahomes, who has 14 touchdown passes, one interception and a passer rating of 111.9. But the Chiefs probably do need their defense to be closer to adequate than it has been through six weeks.\n\nAD\n\nWhether the Broncos can take advantage remains to be seen. They\u2019ve had two straight wins following their 0-4 beginning under their first-year head coach, Vic Fangio. The rough start was a bit deceiving, given that two of the four defeats came on field goals as time expired. That left Fangio talking about the need to pay attention to the tiny details that go along with finishing games properly.\n\nAD\n\nBroncos running back Phillip Lindsay totaled 184 rushing yards in the victories over the Los Angeles Chargers and Tennessee Titans. He should be the focal point of the Denver offense Thursday night, given the struggles of the Chiefs against the run. The Broncos need more from quarterback Joe Flacco. The former Super Bowl MVP for the Baltimore Ravens has five interceptions to go with six touchdown passes and has a passer rating of 87.4 through six games of his first season with the Broncos.\n\nThe Denver defense ranks fourth in the league against the pass and fourth overall. The Broncos probably need a big pass-rushing night by standout linebacker Von Miller to have a chance to pull off an upset. He\u2019s off to a slow start, with only 2.5 sacks this season. But he gets to work against an injury-depleted offensive line for the Chiefs while attempting to chase down Mahomes, who has been playing on a bad ankle.\n\nAD\n\nMany eyes will be on the officiating crew headed by referee Shawn Smith. It has been an NFL season in which officiating controversies have remained prominent. Coaches have griped about the league\u2019s application of the new rule making pass interference reviewable by instant replay. And the on-field officials have had issues with other calls, as with the two crucial illegal-hands-to-the-face penalties called on Detroit\u2019s Trey Flowers during the Lions\u2019 last-second loss Monday night at Green Bay.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL acknowledged Tuesday that the second of those calls against Flowers, which extended the Packers\u2019 drive to a winning field goal as time expired, was erroneous. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day owners\u2019 meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that the league must be vigilant about trying to improve the quality and consistency of its officiating.\n\nThat gets put to the test Thursday as the NFL returns to the field for the first time since the Lions-Packers game with another nationally televised affair.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Week 7 of the NFL season gets going with the Chiefs-Broncos matchup, as Kansas City looks to avoid a three-game losing streak.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hvBv-GFfxpTl7tY9zK2I0WzwAwc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DIVUTQHRHUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
