One motivation for spinning off Prosus is to narrow that value gap.\n\nOne reason for the discount is Naspers' heavy weighting on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\n\nThe stock currently represents around a quarter of the value of the shareholder-weighted top 40 index, which makes it difficult for index investors attempting to limit their exposure to a single share.\n\nThe Prosus listing should see about a quarter of Naspers' value move to Amsterdam.\n\n\"We believe Prosus will present a new and attractive opportunity for global tech investors to access our unique portfolio of internet businesses, providing a strong foundation for our future growth plans,\" said CEO Bob van Dijk.\n\n\"The listing is also designed to reduce our weighting on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which we believe will maximise shareholder value over time.\"\n\nNaspers will retain a stake of about 25% in Prosus, with the other 25% distributed to Naspers shareholders and making up the free float.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOD DELIVERY FIRMS\n\nProsus also has stakes in fast-growing food delivery, social media, and payments companies in China, India, Brazil and Russia. See Factbox: [uL5N26118H]\n\nIn the food and delivery sector, it owns stakes in Delivery Hero, Takeaway.com, Latin America's iFood, and India's Swiggy.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended in March 2019, Prosus posted a 15% rise in revenue to $2.65 billion, and its operating loss narrowed to $418 million from $615 million.\n\nProsus accounts for its Tencent stake as an \"equity accounted investment\", which added $3.41 billion euros to 2019 pre-tax profit.\n\nProsus' net profit ended up being $4.25 billion, thanks to a $1.6 billion windfall on its sale of a 10% stake in Flipkart to Walmart.\n\nJasper Jansen, an analyst at the Dutch shareholders rights group VEB, said he applauded the arrival of Prosus.\n\n\"We love the fresh blood - finally there's a real company listing here that\u2019s active in the new economy,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he criticized Naspers' decision to maintain a two-class share structure system which gives its biggest shareholders extra voting rights in some circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Pravin Char and Jan Harvey)", "description": "South African e-commerce group Naspers is listing its global empire of consumer internet assets under the name of Prosus on Wednesday - and the jewel in the crown is a 31% stake in Chinese tech titan Tencent.
