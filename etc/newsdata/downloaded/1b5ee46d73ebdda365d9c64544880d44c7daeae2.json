In verse after verse, rappers are claiming that they no longer make use of professional clothes-pickers, implying that they are more than capable of going to the shops without special assistance.\n\nThe most notable entry in the anti-stylist movement is French Montana and Drake\u2019s No Stylist, in which the pair claim that they have such sartorial wherewithal that they can wear \u201cnew Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag\u201d without any need from outside advisers. The song, released in September last year, went platinum on the Billboard charts and has been streamed almost 150m times on YouTube.\n\nThey are far from the only ones, though: 21 Savage (\u201cI ain\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 round with no stylist, I got too much drip\u201d), Tyler, the Creator (\u201cThese fucking rappers got stylists, it\u2019s cause they can\u2019t think for themselves\u201d), Kanye West (\u201cI don\u2019t see why I need a stylist, when I shop so much I can speak Italian\u201d), Migos (\u201cFlyin\u2019 autopilot \u2013 woah! Don\u2019t need no stylist \u2013 no!\u201d) among others. A$AP Rocky perhaps takes it furthest on his track Shoot Your Stylist where he raps: \u201cMan, I need a chain, Supreme and the Palace / Just a young nigga that will shoot your favourite stylist.\u201d\n\nIn each case, the rapper boasts they are so knowledgable about high-end fashion it would be absurd that someone else could give them better advice than they give themselves. But are they right to avoid outside counsel in this way?\n\nStylists have been a critical part of hip-hop culture since the 90s, following the rise of figures such as June Ambrose, who styled Missy Elliott\u2019s famous vinyl suit in the video for The Rain, and P Diddy and Mase\u2019s tinfoil jackets in the Feel So Good promo.\n\nYet it wasn\u2019t always made easy for rappers. The stylist Rachel Johnson has alleged that when she was working for Ja Rule in 2002, Burberry refused to dress him for the Always on Time video. She bought him a Burberry hat anyway, and the brand became something of a hip-hop style trend, bringing the company a huge new stream of customers and revenue. It\u2019s reported that, eventually, they sent him a thank you card.\n\nThings have moved along a lot since then. The past decade has seen a close and symbiotic relationship between hip-hop and the big fashion houses, with A$AP Rocky the face of Dior, while Gucci partnered with Dapper Dan, arguably the original hip-hop stylist, to create a new line for the brand that was inspired by the bootleg clothing Dan made in the 80s, before the fashion houses shut him down for infringement.\n\nSome rappers are making their no-stylist creed central to their brand. Lil Uzi Vert recently added \u201cNO STYLIST\u201d to his Instagram display name, telling GQ: \u201cI got a manager that books my tours,\u201d he says. \u201cI got an accountant that watches my accountant. Even though I handle my day-to-day, I got someone that makes sure everything\u2019s organised. Why would I ever need a stylist?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Young Thug.

He\u2019s pushing the look, the stylist is just a tool.\u201d She namechecks Tyler, the Creator and A$AP Mob as others who have a big say in their own look, but claims there are some rappers who have stylists deciding their every outfit.\n\nSearch \u201c#NoStylist\u201d on Instagram and you\u2019ll see young lads posting selfies in their loudest shirts and teens mugging to the camera to show their latest Forever 21 looks: the fact they don\u2019t have a stylist is evident, but hip-hop has made \u201cno stylist\u201d less a statement of fact, more a state of mind. Now ordinary people boast of it, not because they\u2019ve turned down fashion advice from a professional, but because they have the mindset of someone who knows exactly how they want to look. So when 12-year-old Timmy from Idaho boasts that \u201cno stylist\u201d got him his SpongeBob bandana, you know he\u2019s 100% legit.", "description": "From Kanye to A$AP Rocky, the hip-hop world is turning its back on clothing advisers \u2013 but some believe it\u2019s just a front", "authors": ["Sam Wolfson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c70b2d859f09849aeff84411717c4fe921a02a8d/0_14_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=236e0cb5eee711be3f799149ce60a0a7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
