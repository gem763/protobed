He chocked [sic], and looks weak and pathetic. Don\u2019t want him at the White House!\u201d tweeted Mr. Trump on Friday.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s critics mocked him for misspelling \u201cchoked,\u201d those on the right were stunned by what Mr. Kerr did say: He drew parallels between U.S. mass shootings and Chinese state-sponsored human-rights abuses.\n\nAsked about such abuses, Mr. Kerr told reporters that the issue \u201chas not come up in terms of people asking about it,\u201d then added, \u201cNor has our record of human-rights abuses come up, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have different issues we have to get to. Saying that is my right as an American. It doesn\u2019t mean that I hate my country. It means I want to address the issue,\u201d Mr. Kerr said at a Thursday press availability. \u201cBut people in China didn\u2019t ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall. I wasn\u2019t asked that question.\u201d\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s David Harsanyi responded, \u201cWhat an immense idiot. The Chinese communist state has murdered tens of millions of people. It has concentration camps open right now. People who shoot ARs in American malls are criminals.\u201d\n\nTurning Point USA\u2019s Benny Johnson tweeted that \u201cSteve Kerr really just compared China\u2019s Concentration Camps to Americans owning AR-15s in the United States.\u201d\n\nWhat an immense idiot. The Chinese communist state has murdered tens of millions of people. It has concentration camps open right now. People who shoot ARs in American malls are criminals. https://t.co/vFumkVVdlM \u2014 David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) October 11, 2019\n\nWhat the what\n\n\n\nProbably because they know such awful occurrences are rare and you know, not carried out by our government like in communist China, Kerr https://t.co/XngZhXIpqT \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 11, 2019\n\nThe NBA has been accused of kowtowing to China after the communist nation canceled a television deal and sponsorships for the Houston Rockets in response to the team\u2019s general manager Daryl Morey tweeting his support for the Hong Kong activists.\n\nThe league canceled media availabilities for the rest of its preseason games in China under pressure from the Chinese government, which also mandated that NBA commissioner Adam Silver cancel his pregame press conference, ESPN reported.\n\n\u201cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u201d the NBA announced in a statement Friday. \u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time.\u201d\n\nMr. Silver said last week the NBA was \u201cnot apologizing\u201d for Mr. Morey\u2019s tweet, and that the league would \u201clive with those consequences,\u201d while critics have accused the NBA of bowing to China to protect a business and fan relationship worth billions.\n\nLast week, the president said that Mr. Kerr, a longtime Trump critic, \u201cwas like a little boy, he was so scared to be even answering the question.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was shaking, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Trump, adding, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to answer the question, and yet he\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly.\u201d\n\nAt the press conference, Mr. Kerr said he had met with five U.S. presidents, including a 1984 visit with President Ronald Reagan, who invited the teenage Kerr and his family after his father was killed in Beirut while serving as president of American University.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, this was my experience \u2014 wow, has the office sunken low,\u201d Mr. Kerr said. \u201cMy hope is we can find a mature, unifier from either party to sit in that chair and try to restore some dignity to the Oval Office again.\u201d\n\nThere was no post-championship trip to the White House for the Warriors in 2017 or 2018 after star player Steph Curry said he didn\u2019t want to attend in 2017, prompting Mr. Trump to withdraw his invitation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
