NO YOU ARE NOT CLOSING WITH AN ELLEN QUESTION.\u201d Margaret Sullivan, a media critic for The Washington Post, called it both \u201ccringe-inducing\u201d and \u201cflat-out embarrassing.\u201d\n\nEven one of the candidates got in on the criticism.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe keep leaving some of these huge issues that impact families off of the question agenda at these debates,\u201d former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes. \u201cAnd really, it\u2019s journalistic malpractice to do that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRepresentatives for CNN and the New York Times, the debate\u2019s co-hosts, did not respond to inquiries about how or why they chose a question that sounds more like a college essay prompt than presidential debate fodder.\n\nBut moderators are generally given wide latitude to determine what candidates will be asked. And the \u201cunexpected personal question\u201d is starting to become a debate staple, said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and author of \u201cPresidential Debates: Fifty Years of High-Risk TV.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe idea is to come up with a topic for which the candidates do not have a prepared response, something that throws them off their stump speeches and requires them to respond spontaneously,\u201d Schroeder wrote in an email. \u201cThat would have been the reasoning behind the \u2018unexpected friend\u2019 question last night.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSimilar inquiries include an infamous example from 2016 in which Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were asked to \u201cname one positive thing\u201d about each other. Over the years, this type of question has occasionally elicited \u201cfascinating responses,\u201d Schroeder said. He cited the \u201cinsightful\u201d answers that George W. Bush and John Kerry provided in 2004, when a moderator pointed out that both Bush and Kerry had strong wives and daughters and asked what they\u2019d learned from the women in their lives.\n\nIn another example, Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen were asked during the 1988 vice presidential debate to name a book or film that had influenced them. Quayle\u2019s response, Schroder said, \u201cseemed particularly contrived and, therefore, unbelievable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes debaters are asked questions that seem to come out of left field but that end up revealing valuable info about the candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case this time, experts agreed. It came too late in the three-hour debate, said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, and because all 12 candidates were asked the same thing, it opened the door for repetition.\n\nUltimately, several candidates didn\u2019t name anyone. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang talked about a trucker and former Trump supporter named Fred. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden all had the same answer: the late senator John McCain.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think that the question could have been improved if the moderators would have said in advance, \u2018No candidates are allowed to use the same answer,\u2019\u201d Kall said. \u201cThat would have forced a variety of people to go deeper into it, not repeat McCain.\u201d\n\nMuch of the criticism centered on the idea that friendship talk took up time that could have been devoted to more important topics.\n\nAD\n\nDebate questions on Ellen DeGeneres: 1\n\n\n\nDebate questions on decimated abortion access: 1\n\n\n\nDebate questions on LGBTQ rights, which are currently up for debate at the Supreme Court: 0\n\n\n\nDebate questions on climate change: 0 \u2014 Emmy Bengtson (@EmmyA2) October 16, 2019\n\nMy answer to this Ellen question is that Republicans are trying to take your health care away. \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) October 16, 2019\n\nmy name is anderson cooper of cnn and you are running to be the leader of the world, please name a pet that changed your life and a hero \u2014 Lupus Haas (@Mobute) October 16, 2019\n\nYet, as The Post reported Wednesday, analysis suggests this year\u2019s Democratic debates have for the most part focused on topics that matter to voters, such as health care.\n\nKall said unexpected, personality-type inquiries can hold value for some voters, who might be interested to see how candidates react to a question they haven\u2019t practiced for in their hours of debate prep. Others might want to know that a candidate is willing to reach across the aisle. The Ellen question, had it been more successful, could have done both.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s value, but also there\u2019s an opportunity cost,\u201d Kall said. \u201cThis was 15 minutes that could have been spent somewhere else. Would that have been more valuable and informative to the viewers? I guess we don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The \u201cunexpected personal question\u201d is starting to become a debate staple.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cG50uVPf17vpD7_jM5-D7b0sXI8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RJLTEHXQHUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
