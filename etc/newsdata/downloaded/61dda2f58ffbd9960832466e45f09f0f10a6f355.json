In the last years they just defend, that\u2019s how it is, it\u2019s no criticism, it\u2019s just a fact,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you think United v Liverpool you think both teams attacking, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\nSolskjaer rejected the suggestion his team were defensive saying they had been set up to pressure and attack and he received some support from his predecessor, who was more than once accused of \u2018parking the bus\u2019 at Anfield.\n\nMourinho said Klopp had clearly not enjoyed the way United made the game difficult for Liverpool.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t like the menu. He likes meat and he got fish. so he was not happy,\u201d said Mourinho, who noted that Solskjaer\u2019s tactics had worked.\n\n\u201cThey are of course much stronger against opponents who give them a chance of transitions and counter-attacks. United didn\u2019t do that. And he didn\u2019t like the menu.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were organised, they had a plan. You can agree or disagree, but they had a game plan, they stuck to it.\n\n\u201cIf I was Ole I would be proud, and a little bit frustrated, because I think the boys, they gave everything,\u201d said Mourinho who had heard his name sung by United fans in the Stretford end.\n\nKlopp was also upset that referee Martin Atkinson had not seen what he considered a foul by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi at the start of the move that led to United\u2019s goal.\n\nThe German was annoyed that VAR had not overturned the goal but Solskjaer, unsurprisingly perhaps, felt the referee was correct in his verdict.\n\n\u201cFoul? No chance, we\u2019re not playing basketball. He touched him but it\u2019s not a clear and obvious error,\u201d he said.", "description": "The journey from the bench to the pundit's studio is so quick in the modern game that some could be forgiven for thinking Manchester United had two managers after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Liverpool at Old Trafford.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443099412&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0NL", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
