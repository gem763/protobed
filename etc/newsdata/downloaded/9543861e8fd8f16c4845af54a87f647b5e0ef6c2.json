Bitcoin crashed and the entire market turned bloody. You know, the usual. Until it's not usual and Bitcoin makes one of the biggest move in its history. We found out that Bakkt aims to lure institutional investors with a new product, that Killers are coming for Ethereum, and Adam Back said there's another way to safeguard BTC. In South Korea, eleven giants are teaming up for a government-backed \u201cconsortium-type\u201d blockchain network, Binance joined Kakao\u2019s Klaytn blockchain project in its governance council, more than 800 companies are doing business in crypto, and Samsung added twelve more dapps to it Blockchain Keystore.\n\nWhile regulators join forces to tackle global crypto challenges, Ukraine wants to push through crypto regulation \u2018till the end of 2019, Venezuela authorized Petro-to-fiat trading, and Russia may block Facebook. Speaking of Facebook: Twitter CEO dismissed it as a gimmick, its Libra alternative may be on a collision course with Binance's Venus project, Pentagon agrees with Libra over China - while China makes a major push for blockchain - and Facebook's CEO contradicted himself again, but as the hearing started, Facebook's shares soared, while BTC was nearing a death cross. Meanwhile, Justin Sun is not buying Poloniex, and poorly rated exchanges outperformed the industry\u2019s stars. We learned how Brexit might affect BTC, what BTC investing in 2020 will look like, but also about ways and benefits of running your own BTC node. You can also run a full node on your phone, store your seed in a capsule, and earn BTC while playing games, while some of the Ethereum-based gaming is actually gambling.\n\nNow, check out these 20 jokes we\u2019ve gathered for you, neatly in one place.
