We\u2019re coming up on Week 5, and the star cornerback is still with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nThe Jaguars\u2019 owner wants to keep it that way.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nShad Khan, speaking with the Associated Press, said he does not plan to trade Ramsey.\n\n\u201cObviously, football is a team sport and I\u2019m sensitive to what individual insight or viewpoint or requests (there) might be,\u201d Khan told Mark Long of the AP. \u201cBut we have to do the right thing for the team. We value the values Jalen adds to us, to the Jaguars. I think we value him highly. We\u2019re still looking at what is the right thing for the Jaguars, and I think right now the best thing is to have him be part of the team.\u201d\n\nShad Khan wants Jalen Ramsey on Jaguars\n\nKhan saying they\u2019re \u201cstill looking at what is the right thing for the Jaguars\u201d gives him an out. If this becomes an untenable situation with Ramsey, there\u2019s still time to deal him before the deadline.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time Khan has indicated he wants Ramsey to remain a Jaguar. He also said he was willing to give Ramsey a record contract extension for a cornerback.\n\nRamsey said after a Week 2 game, in which he got in a sideline confrontation with coach Doug Marrone, that he had a problem with the team\u2019s front office. He felt disrespected by unspecified things said after the game. He told his agent after the game he wanted a trade. He has not backed off on that request.\n\nRamsey wants to be traded. The owner doesn\u2019t want to deal him. So what happens next?\n\nRamsey didn\u2019t play last week\n\nLast week was an odd one for Ramsey. He dealt with the flu, then back and hamstring injuries. He left the team to see the birth of his chid. Then he was inactive for Sunday\u2019s game due to the injuries. Plenty wondered if Ramsey\u2019s trade request and the injuries that kept him out of practice and last week\u2019s game were connected.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason the Jaguars wouldn\u2019t want to move Ramsey. He is a top player at a premium position. The Jaguars could deal him for picks, but at 2-2 they don\u2019t feel this season is over and Ramsey is a building block for their franchise.\n\nKhan doesn\u2019t want to trade Ramsey. It will be interesting to find out what Ramsey thinks about that.\n\nCornerback Jalen Ramsey has requested a trade, but the Jaguars haven't moved him.
