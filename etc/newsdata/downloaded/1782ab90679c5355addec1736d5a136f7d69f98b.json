Until this year, everything ran well, though the wines that were sold for me showed a loss. My last transaction was a year ago, since when I have had great difficulty in making contact with them to get my wine portfolio released to the bonded warehouse where I have an account.\n\nSince you first contacted me, you will have seen my report last Sunday about the disgraceful state of affairs at BWC \u2013 a business which has not only kept its real name secret, but has also hidden from its investors the name of the man who pulls the strings.\n\nOn paper, the business is run by Boington Anthony Grant, but the true boss is Freddie Achom. Not that it makes much difference. Both have criminal records for fraud. Both were banned for years from acting as company directors.\n\nBut even while breaking the law year after year, Achom has raised his profile to the point where he appears on lists of Britain\u2019s most successful and influential black business personalities.\n\nOn paper, the business is run by Boington Anthony Grant, but the true boss is Freddie Achom. Not that it makes much difference. Both have criminal records for fraud...\n\nLast week, I published a picture of him chatting with then Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street. And today, here he is hobnobbing with Royalty at a reception at St James\u2019s Palace. I ask again \u2013 does nobody vet the guests at these events?\n\nLeaving aside the wines you sold at a loss, you invested over \u00a370,000 with BWC. But despite all your requests, wine worth only about \u00a310,000 has been released by BWC to the bonded warehouse. The rest is unaccounted for. I asked BWC to explain. It did not. I also asked BWC for the full legal name of the business. Again, it failed to comment.\n\nAnd this is important, because it has traded under a variety of names, all without identifying the person, persons, or company using those names. This is illegal.\n\nMisleadingly, anyone who checked with Companies House would have found that there really was a Bordeaux Wine Company Limited. It was owned by its sole director Arlene King. She told me: \u2018I was an employee of Bordeaux Wine Company who was asked to become a director in January 2005, although it was only ever in a nominal sense as I remained an employee and had no operational control.\u2019\n\nShe added that shortly afterwards, her employers \u2013 who she fails to name \u2013 \u2018transferred all of the assets of the Bordeaux Wine Company to the partnership called BWC Management and Consulting Partners and that became the operative entity for all of their wine dealings.\u2019 Who were those partners? King does not say.\n\nBordeaux Wine Company Limited was compulsorily struck off by officials at Companies House last February. But for years it filed accounts and was listed as an unblemished business.\n\nLast week, I published a picture of him chatting with then Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street. And today, here he is hobnobbing with Royalty at a reception at St James\u2019s Palace. I ask again \u2013 does nobody vet the guests at these events?\n\nCustomers of the mysterious business that called itself simply \u2018BWC\u2019, and sold wine as an investment, and had Arlene King as manager, might well have checked with Companies House and seen that all was well, not knowing that the business they poured their money into was secretly run by Freddie Achom and Boington Grant.\n\nKing is now director of yet another wine company, Our Sommelier Limited, which she set up while she was still employed as general manager of BWC.\n\nBut her role at BWC is not the first time she has been working for a company where the real boss was hiding in the background.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, King was company secretary of Australian Portfolio Wines UK Limited and for three of those years she was a director as well. After a Government investigation, the High Court ordered in 2015 that the company be shut down. Liquidators found that the company had \u2018lent\u2019 \u00a31.2 million to its real boss Freddie Achom. They counted themselves lucky to recover \u00a3700,000 from him.\n\nBut Achom had been banned as a company director after the collapse of an even earlier wine investment business. So in 2016, he appeared at Southwark Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to breaching that ban.\n\nThe court heard that from 2004 to 2013, no major decision at Australian Portfolio Wines was made without his say-so. He was the secret boss, hiding behind Arlene King and others. For this, he was given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay a cash penalty of \u00a3945,000 or face five years in jail.\n\nSo where does all this leave you? At some point BWC became the trading name of a company called Management & Consulting Partners Unlimited, registered to Achom\u2019s business partner Boington Grant. And last Monday, that company transferred its registered office to the address of a firm of insolvency experts.\n\nThis is very unlikely to be good news for you. Does your wine exist? BWC will not say. If it exists, is it in your name? BWC will not say. Arlene King, who distances herself from BWC, told me: \u2018I had no real authority whatsoever to make any meaningful decisions.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I abhor some of the practices of this trade, which is why my company is totally transparent in the way it is run\u2019, which is not something that could be said about BWC. This cries out for an Insolvency Service investigation \u2013 and soon.", "description": "Tony Hetherington is Financial Mail on Sunday's ace investigator, fighting readers' corners, revealing the truth that lies behind closed doors and winning victories for the ripped-off.", "authors": ["Tony Hetherington", "Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
