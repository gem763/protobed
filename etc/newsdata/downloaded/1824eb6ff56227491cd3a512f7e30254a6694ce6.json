When his 1995 debut album, Maxinquaye, went No 3 and made him a media darling, his horrified reaction was to dismiss the \u201ccoffee-table\u201d record and the trip-hop movement it birthed, and to move his music firmly left field to evade unwanted critical hyperbole.\n\nTricky: \u2018I\u2019ve lost people before and bounced back. This is different\u2019 Read more\n\nThis aversion to the limelight was best illustrated when he was an unlikely guest during Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s headline set at Glastonbury in 2011. Trapped in the spotlights before roughly 100,000 people and a TV audience of millions, he froze, unable to deliver his verse. \u201cI told the press my mic wasn\u2019t working,\u201d he later admitted. \u201cIt was working fine.\u201d\n\nHe made a recent return to the hated spotlight with the publication of an autobiography, Hell Is Round the Corner. It\u2019s a frequently harrowing read, from his revelation that his first memory, aged four, was viewing his mother in her coffin after she killed herself, to the tragic death of his daughter Mazy, aged 24, this year.\n\nTonight though, more than two decades and 12 albums on from Maxinquaye, Tricky is back in the shadows he loves, figuratively and literally. As is his wont, the show takes place in near-darkness: he is a whispering half-presence, a phantom wraith, slipping in and out of the on-stage murk.\n\nIt is a mesmerising set. Essentially a left-field producer, Tricky weaves hypnotic webs of electro twitches, grunge guitar and husky, half-heard murmurs. The opening track, You Don\u2019t Wanna, both samples Eurythmics\u2019 Sweet Dreams and is on the verge of slipping into a warped, barbed take on Nirvana\u2019s Smells Like Teen Spirit.\n\nCo-vocalist Marta Z\u0142akowska is an ethereal foil to Tricky\u2019s antic intensity. On the ominous I\u2019m Not Going, she whispers, \u201cI\u2019m not really into it\u201d, as if succumbing to a wily predator. As he does all night, Tricky paces the stage and performs a nervous-tic mime, wrestling his black T-shirt as if trying to peel off a second skin.\n\nEvery song sounds like a jagged inner monologue that has been externalised. It is claustrophobic, foreboding music, and yet you long to dive into it. On Armor, from Tricky\u2019s latest album, 2017\u2019s underrated Ununiform, he pause his restless pacing to muse, \u201cHow strange it is to love!\u201d \u2013 as if it\u2019s the first time the concept has occurred to him.\n\nFor the agitated, narcotic Here My Dear, performed twice, he flails at the air as if battling an invisible assailant. It is a violent contrast to his cover of Sia\u2019s Breathe Me, which he reduces to a skeletal, glacial reverie. Virtually nothing happens, and it does so intensely and beautifully.\n\nThe show is erratic and unpredictable. Halfway through, the musicians abruptly quit the stage. When they return five minutes later, Tricky signals his disinterest during the luscious Overcome, the sole offering from Maxinquaye, by again vanishing into the wings until it is over.\n\nHe is a genius fractured auteur, an enigma wrapped in a Rizla. He and Z\u0142akowska perform brilliant reconstructive surgery on Hole\u2019s Doll Parts, replacing the original\u2019s inchoate ire with oceanic melancholy. For the encore, he is joined by tonight\u2019s support act, bearded soul tyro Murkage Dave, to mumble through the latter\u2019s I Pay My Taxes (You Can\u2019t Talk to Me Like I\u2019m a Dickhead). \u201cWe just learned that backstage, then we come out and done it!\u201d divulges Tricky happily.\n\nIt is a confounding night \u2013 and all the better for it. Almost a quarter century after being cursed with unwanted celebrity, Tricky remains an uncompromising maverick; a bizarre, bafflingly brilliant musician.", "description": "After a year of tragedy, the spotlight-shy producer stays in the shadows during this erratic yet utterly mesmerising set", "authors": ["Ian Gittins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/237ac38d7ebab0e76d10c761230a5191511436a0/0_356_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4504d22fc9e852e1b63e7d6a1bcf3af2", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
