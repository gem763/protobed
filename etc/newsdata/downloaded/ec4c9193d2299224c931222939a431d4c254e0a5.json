(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nEarlier this week, President Trump announced proudly to the world (via Twitter, of course) that his approval rating had hit 53 percent. If that number surprises you, it should. It\u2019s from a notoriously Trump-friendly pollster that reflects only people it determines are \u201clikely voters\u201d \u2014 and which shows 48 percent approval for Trump, even with those caveats. Nearly every time Trump tweets one of these frequent \u201clook at my approval numbers!\u201d tweets, he\u2019s sharing a number from Rasmussen.\n\nThat said, though, Trump\u2019s low approval rating may not be the albatross it seems. As journalist Josh Jordan points out, Trump\u2019s approval in Gallup polling is fairly close to what the past three presidents have seen at this point in their presidencies, and each of them won reelection.\n\nGraphed, it looks like this. Trump\u2019s about where Barack Obama was in September 2011, according to Gallup, for example, and even passed him for a bit.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThose current numbers, though, don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nCommentator Liam Donovan responded to Jordan by emphasizing a key point that isolating this moment doesn\u2019t capture.\n\nWould like to see this put in context of range over first term and approval in November. The problem for Trump isn't that he's that far out from being in range, it's that his numbers are intractible, thanks largely to the intensity of the opposition. https://t.co/ywRgwknAdo \u2014 Liam Donovan (@LPDonovan) September 27, 2019\n\nYou can see it on the graph above. There\u2019s a lot more movement for George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and even Obama than there is for Trump.\n\nWe can visualize that by looking at each Gallup poll over the course of the presidents\u2019 terms in office. Among all Americans, Clinton\u2019s approval ranged over 37 percentage points. Bush\u2019s spanned 66 points \u2014 a function of the surge he saw after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Obama\u2019s approval ranged over 26.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval has spanned 10 points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nGranted, those spreads are over the entirety of each president\u2019s terms in office. Looking only at the period through September of the year before the election, things don\u2019t change much. Clinton\u2019s approval ranged over 23 points (he hit his high after reelection), and Bush\u2019s ranged 41 points (his low came after reelection). Obama\u2019s range to this point was the same as his overall range.\n\nThe point is that while Trump\u2019s approval may mirror Clinton\u2019s, Bush\u2019s and Obama\u2019s, all of them had, at some point before this point in the cycle, approval ratings that were significantly higher. Notice the top edges of the boxes in the graph above: Their highs were much higher than Trump\u2019s. One reason to think their approval ratings might rebound is that they had been higher before.\n\nYou can see that this is what happened. The vertical dashed lines on the graph above mark each president\u2019s reelection date. Clinton and Obama noticeably improved; Bush did, as well, though it\u2019s hard to see, crossing 50 percent right before the election.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t we assume that Trump\u2019s approval rating would also spike as the election approaches? Well, it could. But there\u2019s a structural difference to his approval.\n\nConsider approval ratings for each president among members of his own party. We see a similar narrowing of approval ranges, with Trump\u2019s approval among Republicans staying high but only within a 12-point range.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nMore important, among the opposing party, Trump has seen far less movement. Granted, after about 2010, Obama\u2019s approval rating among Republicans never moved a lot, but Trump never got even a minor honeymoon period from Democrats.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nFor Obama, the calcification of his approval among Democrats and Republicans as president meant that most of the movement he saw in polling was a function of increasing or dropping support from independents. Here, too, Trump is unusually stable: His approval rating among independents has ranged over 13 points in Gallup polling.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTo this point in each president\u2019s term, Trump is an outlier on that metric. Independent approval of Clinton ranged over 31 points through September of the year before his reelection. For Bush it was 46 points, and for Obama, 29. Each had, at some point before now, been more popular with independents and members of the opposing party, allowing them to gain ground before reelection.\n\nTrump is right now about where he has been since inauguration. A few points can make a big difference in presidential elections, but there\u2019s no reason to think that Trump\u2019s going to get more than a few points.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word for it. Even in the polls Trump himself has tweeted, his approval has barely moved.", "description": "Trump's poll ratings are unusually stable.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WX1Gk4HXS9tewcGtgZrFE9dbs0s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JCBQIBXAUQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
