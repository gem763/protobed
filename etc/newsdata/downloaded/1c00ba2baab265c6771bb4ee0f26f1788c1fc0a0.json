Places that offer residency-for-investment visas\u2014as well as the U.K., in part because of its colonial ties to the city\u2014stand to gain from growing interest in emigration from Hong Kong.\n\nMore: Amid Political Changes, Buyers Would Be Wise to Consider Prime Central London\n\nFour high-profile Hong Kong families have retained immigration lawyer Reaz H. Jafri to help them relocate since mid-June, when protests erupted over a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed people charged with certain crimes in semi-autonomous Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial.\n\n\u201cMost of my clients are very, very wealthy, and Hong Kong is a good tax jurisdiction that has maintained its identity from its days as a British colony,\u201d said Mr. Jafri, a New York-based partner with international firm Withers Worldwide. \u201cSo for four influential families to decide this in six to eight weeks is quite significant.\u201d\n\nThree of those families intend to acquire European passports, including one who\u2019s purchased a large villa in Italy with plans to apply for residency there, and another who wants to do the same in Switzerland, Mr. Jafri said. He added that the fourth family intends to acquire U.S. residency.\n\nIn August, Mr. Jafri was in Hong Kong to meet with clients and was caught in the protests twice, one time at the airport and another when police fired tear gas while he was at a nearby cafe.\n\nIn the weeks since then, tension has intensified further. Violence crescendoed a week ago as clashes between police, armed with water cannons and tear gas, and brick-throwing protesters erupted in the first real gunshot fired\u2014a warning from a police officer.\n\nThe number of inquiries from Hong Kong flooding Henley & Partners, one of the largest immigration investment law firms in the world, more than doubled in June and July of this year compared to a year ago, said the firm\u2019s CEO, Dr. Juerg Steffen in an email last month.\n\n\u201cWe have recently seen a significant spike in interest and inquiries from Hong Kong, as the protests in the city escalate,\u201d Mr. Steffen said. He also attributed the surge in queries to a broader interest in acquiring multiple residencies among the world\u2019s wealthy.\n\n\u201cOur best bet would be that domestic unrest in Hong Kong is only part of the story,\u201d Mr. Steffen said. \u201cHigh-net-worth individuals all over the world are increasingly looking to new avenues of value and security beyond the traditional sense of wealth: They want a safeguard and an insurance policy for the 21st century.\u201d\n\nFor now, many Hong Kong clients eager to pick up homes and residency abroad don\u2019t actually intend to physically relocate, Mr. Steffen said. \u201cFor many clients, the appeal of alternative residence or citizenship lies in the fact that it represents a \u2018plan B\u2019 should they require it.\u201d\n\nThe unrest is fueling demand for so-called \u201cgolden visas,\u201d which offer residency in exchange for a large investment, primarily in Europe and to some extent in Malaysia, multiple lawyers and real estate brokers said. Applicants from Hong Kong residents for Malaysia\u2019s residency scheme are up by around 30% compared to those approved last year, Reuters reported last month.\n\nIn particular, Portugal\u2019s visa program\u2014which grants residency in exchange for a minimum property investment of \u20ac350,000\u2014has seen a marked increase in interest from Hong Kong, said Charles Roberts, a Lisbon-based managing partner at Fine & Country Estate Agents.\n\nPortugal\u2019s investment visa was initially very popular with mainland Chinese but drew little demand from Hong Kong \u201cbecause they felt they were living in a pretty stable economic, political and religious environment,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cSince the current troubles started, that has changed.\u201d\n\nThough interest from Hongkongers in Lisbon is very high, he added, converting inquiries into actual sales has been slow.\n\nLuxury Portfolio International agents in Hong Kong have said that some potential emigres may be holding out hope that political tensions will subside, Ms. Anton said. Others also need to sell off property in Hong Kong first in order to free up cash to make investments abroad.\n\n\u201cMany have assets tied to Hong Kong property, which has gotten less liquid\u2014that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Ms. Anton said.\n\nOver the past couple of years, formerly frenzied price growth for houses has cooled in Hong Kong\u2014one of the least affordable real estate markets in the world. Luxury sales prices were flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, according to a quarterly index from global brokerage Knight Frank. Meanwhile, local agents are reporting a dropoff in viewings as demonstrations disrupt transportation across Hong Kong on the weekends.\n\nThis is not the first time residents, fearing the encroachment of Beijing, have looked abroad for peace of mind.\n\nBritain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 under an agreement for \u201cone state, two systems,\u201d whereby China would allow the city\u2019s capitalist economy to remain until at least 2047. Ahead of the handover, the U.K. made a special status passport\u2014called a BN(O), or British National (Overseas) passport\u2014available to anyone who was a Hong Kong permanent resident before 1997.\n\nIn 2015-16, amid an increased encroachment of Beijing in Hong Kong's affairs, foreign visa and passport applications spiked. The U.K. recorded a surge in applications for BN(O) passports, which don\u2019t grant residency but do allow for easy travel to the U.K., Reuters reported at the time.\n\nNow, Hongkongers again are turning to London to make a back-up plan, even as Britain grapples with its own political turmoil over its impending exit from the European Union.\n\nTwo London-based real estate agencies and one developer said they\u2019ve seen a spike in activity from wealthy Hong Kong house hunters in prime central London.\n\nMore: Los Angeles Has the World\u2019s Highest Luxury Rental Yield\n\n\"In the past two weeks alone, we have had four serious high-end inquiries from prospective purchasers looking at homes here with many citing the political unrest in Hong Kong as being the primary motive to buy,\" said Mark Pollack, director of U.K. brokerage Aston Chase, in a mid-August statement.\n\nOne such buyer has agreed to buy a \u201csubstantial\u201d prime central London apartment, which is intended as a second home but will help \u201cpreserve the Hong Kong nationals\u2019 assets and wealth\u201d in case the political situation deteriorates further, the agency said.\n\nLondon looks particularly attractive to property investors at the moment since home prices in the British capital have fallen roughly 20% from their 2014-15 peak and the pound has broadly weakened against other currencies.\n\n\u201cOverseas buyers are taking advantage of the weak sterling right now, especially those from China and Hong Kong,\u201d said Jonathan Roberts, senior sales manager at Strawberry Star.\n\nJamie Read, director of London estate agency Tavistock Bow, said the firm has also noted an uptick in Hong Kong buyers who are thinking long-term.\n\n\u201cThe change I\u2019ve noticed with buyers I\u2019ve registered recently is that they are less focused on yield or potential for capital growth, and more focused on the idea of London as a safe bet that will hold value for the longer term,\u201d Mr. Read said.\n\nFrom Penta: A Lamborghini Veneno Could Fetch US$6.3 Million at Bonhams\n\nActivists have shown little sign of backing down despite attempts from mainland China to quell the unrest and warnings about the potential economic consequences.\n\nEven if demonstrations do fizzle out, an underlying anxiety over the future of Hong Kong existed before the protests started and will likely remain, said Tony Saich, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nMr. Saich, who\u2019s also the director of the university's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, said he\u2019s surprised at the duration of the protests and the very wide range of people who\u2019ve participated in them.\n\n\u201cWhat it shows is how many people in Hong Kong who do not identify with Beijing\u2019s aims and policies, and don\u2019t really see themselves as being Chinese,\u201c Mr. Saich said. When the protests do die down, \u201cthe underlying sentiment of concern and sense that the Hong Kong identity is being eroded will not go away.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Mansion Global .", "description": "Countries offering visas in exchange for property investment are among the places residents are considering", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103823/social"}
