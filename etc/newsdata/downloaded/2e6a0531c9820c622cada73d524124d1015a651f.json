But, he added, \u201cI sure as hell believe that it would work in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all going to come down to.\u201d\n\nThe church-state divide shouldn\u2019t dissuade the candidates, McCurry told me. \u201cThat\u2019s such a misreading of what the political DNA of America is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had religion woven into our political structures and our political debate from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nBesides, he added, a Democrat who speaks persuasively about religion has a potentially huge tactical advantage: \u201cThink ahead to the general election. If you\u2019re talking about faith in an authentic, genuine way, imagine the contrast if you\u2019re running against Donald Trump, who has absolutely none of that vocabulary.\u201d While the president may have the farthest reaches of the religious right locked down, many Americans of faith are appalled by him.\n\nAnd he\u2019s vulnerable not just because of his personal history and public demeanor, which amount to a raging bonfire of the pieties. He also has governed in ways that contradict the principles of charity and mercy that are central to many religions.\n\nPete Buttigieg took gorgeously effective note of this in the Democrats\u2019 first debate, in June, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of migrants at the border.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut we should call out hypocrisy when we see it.\u201d And any political party that suggests that \u201cGod would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents \u2014 that God would condone putting children in cages \u2014 has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, a churchgoing Episcopalian, refuses to cede religion to Republicans or let them use it as some crude moral cudgel. He weaves it into discussions of his marriage to another man. \u201cNothing has made me feel more connected, more able to be true, however imperfectly, to my faith than the experience of putting myself second,\u201d he said at a CNN town hall this month. \u201cThat came with committing my life to my husband, Chasten.\u201d", "description": "The candidates\u2019 reticence about religion is excessive and unwise.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22bruniWeb/22bruniWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
