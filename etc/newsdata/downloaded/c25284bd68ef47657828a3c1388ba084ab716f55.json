Victor Robles followed with a sacrifice fly that tied the game. Difo, who was making his first start since May 16, followed with a single to right-center off reliever Mike Morin (1-3) that scored Gomes.\n\nHowie Kendrick and Brian Dozier homered for the Nationals, who have won four straight.\n\nSanchez (11-8) allowed two runs and six hits, striking out seven without a walk. Sean Doolittle earned his first save since a stint on the injured list. He pitched a scoreless ninth for his 29th save in 35 attempts and first since Aug. 16.\n\nBrad Miller hit a solo homer in the seventh, his third in two games, and Bryce Harper had two hits for the Phillies, who have lost five straight.\n\nPhillies starter Drew Smyly allowed two runs in 6 1/3 and struck out a season-high 10 batters.\n\nTAKING TURNS\n\nWhile Anthony Rendon and Trea Turner rested, Kendrick, Juan Soto, Adam Eaton and Victor Robles were in the lineup.\n\n\u201cI still want to play these games to win,\u201d Nationals manager Davey Martinez said. \u201cBut we got to be smart about giving guys some days off. Today is no Anthony, no Trea. Both deserve days off, obviously. We\u2019ll see how it goes, and hopefully get Juan a couple of days off in the near future.\u201d\n\nKAPLER\u2019S FUTURE\n\nWith the Phillies eliminated from playoff contention Tuesday, Kapler was asked about his future with the club. He is 159-161 with the Phillies, who spent heavily in free agency in the offseason but will miss the postseason for the eighth consecutive year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be time to reflect on my future when we get to the end of the season,\u201d Kapler said. \u201cRight now, my job is to continue to stay focused on managing the major league club and devoting myself to the organization, and I\u2019m going to continue to do that through the end.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPhillies: C J.T. Realmuto will miss the remainder of the season with a right knee injury. Kapler said Realmuto has returned to Philadelphia and will undergo a \u201cmeniscus cleanup\u201d on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s no long-term concerns about this for J.T.,\u201d Kapler said.\n\nNationals: C Kurt Suzuki (elbow) was working on throws to the bases before the game. He hasn\u2019t started a game since Sept. 5. \u201cHe threw about 90 percent, feels good,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cSo we will do it again tomorrow, see how he feels. I\u2019m shooting for maybe Friday and Saturday to get him in the game.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: LHP Jason Vargas (7-8, 4.40 ERA) makes his final start of the season as the five-game series concludes.\n\nNationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (17-6, 3.37) is 13-2 with a 2.62 ERA in 26 career starts versus the Phillies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wilmer Difo drove in the go-ahead run with an RBI single in the seventh inning and Anibal Sanchez pitched seven solid innings as the Washington Nationals beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Harvey Valentine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/phillies_nationals_baseball_05462_c0-0-3852-2245_s1770x1032.jpg?759f28f35c1332e429d8ae62defb30a63a0f0e00", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
