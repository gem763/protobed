The protest was expected to continue through 9 a.m.\n\n\u201cSince we Shut Down DC on Monday, the U.S. Government has shown no indication that it will act on climate,\u201d organizers said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, the Coalition to Shut Down DC will disrupt business-as-usual in the nation\u2019s capital again.\u201d\n\nKaela Bamberger, a spokeswoman for the coalition, said protesters would target four sites in downtown Washington: the Trump International Hotel, the Environmental Protection Agency, investment firm BlackRock and Wells Fargo Bank.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe said the Trump hotel and the EPA were chosen because of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201crampant climate skepticism,\u201d and the financial institutions because of their investments in fossil fuels. Organizers earlier this week said sites for Monday\u2019s protests were chosen because of traffic volume and their proximity to the offices of \u201cclimate criminals\u201d such as petroleum companies and lobbyists for the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe group released a march route, which roughly includes streets in an area between 15th and 12th streets NW, and I Street and Constitution Avenue NW.
