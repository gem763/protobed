It\u2019s proved unacceptable to the government south of the border. Here is why the idea is so controversial.\n\n1. What is Stormont?\n\nIt is Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing assembly, effectively a devolved parliament for the region. Created after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 ended decades of sectarian violence known as the Troubles, it returned political decision-making to Belfast for the first time since the British imposed direct rule in 1972. Unlike its unionist-dominated predecessor, the assembly requires the consent of both the mostly Protestant parties which want Northern Ireland to remain part of the U.K. and mainly Catholic parties which want the region to become part of the Irish Republic to meet. But it has been suspended since 2017 after the nationalist Sinn Fein grouping, the second-biggest after the Democratic Unionist Party, pulled its support amid a row tied to a renewable energy scandal. Despite intermittent talks since, the assembly is still some way from returning.\n\n2. Why does it matter for Brexit?\n\nUnder Johnson\u2019s latest proposals, Northern Ireland would keep the same rules as the European Union for all goods after Brexit. In theory, this would help to prevent the return of border infrastructure on the frontier with the Republic of Ireland, one of the EU\u2019s key requirements of any Brexit deal. However, this so-called rule alignment would depend on the consent of Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly and executive: They would have to back it before the end of 2020, and every four years after that.\n\n3. Why does this worry Ireland?\n\nUnder its current rules, just a third of the assembly\u2019s 90 members can block a measure they don\u2019t like using a tool known as a petition of concern. This amounts to an \u201copen veto to be played like a joker at any time,\u201d according to Mark Durkan, a former member of the assembly. The fear in Dublin is that the DUP could use this mechanism to block a vote on rule alignment with the EU. In the most recent election, in 2017, the DUP took 28 seats -- but with the help of other unionists it could get the 30 votes required.\n\n4. What would happen if the DUP exercised that veto?\n\nIt could put the integrity of the EU\u2019s single market in jeopardy. Northern Ireland could end up with standards for products like food that differ from those in the south, something that would almost certainly lead the EU to introduce checks at or close to the border to ensure sub-standard goods don\u2019t make their way into the bloc via the Irish frontier.\n\n5. But what happens if Stormont doesn\u2019t form in time?\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear. Indeed, giving Stormont a veto could actually hinder efforts to restart the assembly because other parties won\u2019t want to hand the DUP a veto, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney warned on Thursday. And to drive his point home, Coveney said Ireland couldn\u2019t possibly accept a situation where a minority could frustrate the majority\u2019s wishes in the region.\n\nSo the U.K. looks to be on a collision course with Ireland and the EU on the issue. The problem for Johnson is that he needs the support of the DUP\u2019s Members of Parliament to get his deal through Westminster. Either Brussels or the DUP will have to give -- and neither shows any sign of doing so.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Peter Flanagan in Dublin at pflanagan23@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ambereen Choudhury at achoudhury@bloomberg.net, Edward Evans, Flavia Krause-Jackson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The \u201cStormont lock\u201d is fast becoming one of the biggest threats to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s increasingly hard-to-grasp Brexit deal.The British proposal would give the unionist side of Northern Ireland\u2019s sectarian divide an effective veto over whether to stay in Europe\u2019s single", "authors": ["Peter Flanagan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s03ZBgw7vw_KzoT4zJG_xQ--~B/aD05NjI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/480ca7377d224120638963717ace8bb3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
