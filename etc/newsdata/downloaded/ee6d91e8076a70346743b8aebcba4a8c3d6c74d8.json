Since the tweet, several Chinese sponsors have suspended ties with the league.\n\nThe NBA has also faced heat from U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle after issuing a statement in which they called Morey\u2019s comments \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Pence huddles with GOP allies on Syria Lawmakers come together to honor Cummings: 'One of the greats in our country's history' MORE on Thursday blasted the NBA for their handling of the controversy, accusing the league of being accommodating to China.\n\n\"Some of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\" Pence said at an event in Washington.\n\nBut Gingrich suggested that the U.S. government should stepped in instead of letting the league face the brunt of the backlash.\n\n\u201cIf we had stepped in and said, \u2018Look you can go ahead and hurt the NBA \u2014 here are the six Chinese companies that we\u2019re going to wipe out, so just understand you want to play this game, we\u2019ll play the game too\u2019, \u201d he said. \u201cWhat you can\u2019t do is have a totally one-sided deal.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) defended the National Basketball Association (NBA) following backlash over comments made by an executive of the Houston Rockets, who expressed solidarity with protestors in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/newtgingrich2-27-15getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
