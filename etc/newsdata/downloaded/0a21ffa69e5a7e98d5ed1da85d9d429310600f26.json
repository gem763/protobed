He was on the third floor, near the US defence secretary and the boss of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa).\n\nArpa had been founded early in 1958 but was quickly eclipsed by Nasa, leading Aviation Week magazine to dismiss it as \"a dead cat hanging in the fruit closet\".\n\nNevertheless, Arpa muddled on - and in 1966, Taylor and Arpa were about to plant the seed of something big.\n\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\n\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

You've got $1m more in your budget right now. Go.\"\n\nThe meeting had taken 20 minutes.\n\nMIT's Larry Roberts had already managed to get one of his mainframes to share data with the Q-32 - two supercomputers chatting on the phone.\n\nIt had been slow, fragile, and fussy to make it work.\n\nBut Taylor, Roberts and their fellow networking visionaries had something much more ambitious in mind - a network to which any computer could connect.\n\nAs Roberts put it at the time, \"almost every conceivable item of computer hardware and software will be in the network\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Larry Roberts's hand-drawn 1969 diagram of the potential Arpanet\n\nThat was an enormous opportunity - it was also a formidable challenge.\n\nComputers were rare, expensive, and puny by modern standards.\n\nThey were typically programmed by hand by the researchers who used them.\n\nWho would persuade these privileged few to set aside their projects to write code in the service of someone else's data sharing project?\n\nIt was like asking a Ferrari owner to idle the engine in order to heat up a fillet steak, before feeding it to someone else's dog.\n\nThe solution was proposed by another computing pioneer, physicist Wesley Clark.\n\nClark had been following the emergence of a new breed of computer.\n\nThe minicomputer was modest and inexpensive compared with the room-sized mainframes installed in universities across the United States.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nClark suggested installing a minicomputer at every site on this new network.\n\nThe local mainframe - the hulking Q-32, for example - would talk to the minicomputer sitting close beside it.\n\nThe minicomputer would then take responsibility for talking to all the other minicomputers on the network - and for the new-and-interesting problem of moving packets of data reliably around the network until they reached their destination.\n\nAll the minicomputers would run in the same way - and if you wrote a networking program for one of them, it would work on them all.\n\nMore things that made the modern economy:\n\nAdam Smith, the father of economics, would have been proud of the way Clark was taking advantage of specialisation and the division of labour - perhaps his defining idea.\n\nThe existing mainframes would keep on doing what they already did well.\n\nThe new minicomputers would be optimised to reliably handle the networking without breaking down.\n\nAnd it surely wouldn't hurt that Arpa could simply pay for them all.\n\nIn one episode of the television comedy series The IT Crowd, the geek heroes convince their technologically clueless boss, Jen, they have \"the Internet\" - a small box with a winking light.\n\nThey offer to lend it to her as long as she promises not to break it.\n\nThe beauty of Clark's idea was that, as far as any particular computer was concerned, this was pretty much how the network would appear.\n\nEach local mainframe had to be programmed merely to talk to the little black box beside it - the local minicomputer.\n\nIf you could do that, you could talk to the entire network that stood behind it.\n\nThe little black boxes were actually large and battleship grey.\n\nThey were called Interface Message Processors (IMPs).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption UCLA professor of computer science Leonard Kleinrock with the first IMP, in 2009\n\nThe IMPs were customised versions of Honeywell minicomputers, which were the size of refrigerators and weighed more than 400kg (63 stone) apiece.\n\nThey cost $80,000 each, more than $500,000 (\u00a3405,000) in today's money.\n\nThe network designers wanted message processors that would sit quietly, with minimal supervision, and just keep on working, come heat or cold, vibration or power surge, mildew, mice, or - most dangerous of all - curious graduate students with screwdrivers.\n\nMilitary-grade Honeywell computers seemed like the ideal starting point, although their armour plating may have been overkill.\n\nThe prototype, IMP 0, emerged early in 1969. It did not work.\n\nA young engineer worked on fixing it for months, manually unwrapping and rewrapping wires on pins about 1mm apart.\n\nIt wasn't until October that year that IMP 1 and IMP 2 were in position at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Stanford Research Institute, more than 500km up the coast.\n\nOn 29 October 1969, two mainframe computers exchanged their first word through their companion IMPs.\n\nIt was, somewhat biblically: \"Lo\".\n\nThe operator had been trying to type: \"Login\" and the network had collapsed after two letters.\n\nA stuttering start - but the Arpanet had been switched on.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A map of nodes and destinations on the early Arpanet\n\nOther networks followed, as did a decade-long project to interconnect these into a network of networks - or simply, \"the internet\".\n\nEventually, the IMPs were supplanted by more modern devices called routers. By the late 1980s, they were museum pieces.\n\nBut the world Roberts had predicted, in which \"almost every conceivable item of computer hardware and software will be in the network\", was becoming a reality.\n\nAnd the IMPs had shown the way.\n\nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
