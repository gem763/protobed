Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open- September 23, 2019 Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open-September 23, 2018 Nagpur, Sept 23 (Reuters) \u2013 Soyabean and cottonseed oil today declined in Vidarbha region of Western Maharashtra on stockists selling looking towards month ending, driven by higher imports amid weak global cues. Fall in demand from millers and retailers also put pressure on soyabean oil. Besides, sufficient stocks, sharp fall on NCDEX and easy condition in Malaysian palm oil also affected sentiment in thin trading activity, sources said Monday. ***** VIDARBHA MARKETS OILS * Groundnut loose, groundnut refined, sunflower refined, linseed, rapeseed, castor and coconut KP oil ruled steady here in sluggish trading activity. * Traders expect weak trend in soyabean oil here. SOYMEAL * Soymeal prices today reported strong here on renewed buying support from South-based traders. SOYABEAN * Soyabean prices recovered strongly in Nagpur Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) on good demand from local crushing plants amid thin supply from producing belts. Fresh hike in soymeal, healthy rise in Madhya Pradesh soyabean prices and enquiries from South-based plants also jacked up prices. About 150 soyabean bags reported for auction in Nagpur APMC, according to sources.
