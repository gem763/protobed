Going to college, according to the survey conducted Sept. 20-24 by RealClear Opinion Research.\n\nThe poll of 2,014 likely voters also found that \u201cAmerican history,\u201d \u201cthe workforce\u201d and staying safe are ranked high as priorities of a good K-12 education \u2014 but are rarely, if ever, talked about on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, the pollsters said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting thing. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an inverse relationship exactly to what\u2019s being talked about in the 2020 campaign, but it does show us that Twitter is not real America,\u201d said Carl M. Cannon, the Washington bureau chief with RealClearPolitics. \u201cAnd what\u2019s being talked about in Washington is not always what people are thinking.\u201d\n\nThe pollsters noted the relatively high rank of \u201cworkforce\u201d among voters. While 72% of those surveyed ranked \u201cworkforce\u201d as \u201cimportant or very important,\u201d only 48% of Americans viewed college preparation with similar importance.\n\nMr. Cannon said Democratic candidates sparring over plans for free college tuition could be missing bigger concerns among voters.\n\n\u201cHow you pay for higher ed is a big part of what\u2019s being discussed on the Democratic side in 2020,\u201d Mr. Cannon said. \u201cBut if no one\u2019s talking vocational education, they\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d\n\nPressed on what \u201cworkforce\u201d means to voters, the pollsters suggested a variety of meanings, including earning a business degree to work on Wall Street and getting a two-year degree to be a welder.\n\n\u201cBut it does suggest that, you know, a Ph.D. in Chaucer is not what people are thinking about,\u201d said Mr. Cannon.\n\nThe survey\u2019s top priorities: \u201cRead and Write\u201d (84%), \u201cBe Good Citizens\u201d (76%), \u201cStay Safe from Violence and Physical Harm\u201d (75%), \u201cThink Critically\u201d (70%) and \u201cHave Knowledge of American History\u201d (70%). Among the lowest ranked priorities: \u201cEngage in Civil Discourse\u201d (41%) and \u201cChallenge the Status Quo\u201d (46%).\n\nHowever, the poll found majority \u2014 even bipartisan \u2014 support for increases to post-secondary tuition assistance. Fifty-nine percent of voters support free college and tuition, the RealClearPolitics found. That figure rises to 63% for free tuition for only middle- or low-income students, and to 71% for free two-year schools.\n\nThe pollsters said parents\u2019 concerns about school safety extend beyond mass shootings and include drugs, cyberbullying and gun violence, especially in places like Chicago, where 60 children were gunned down in the first six months of 2019.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s literally not a partisan gap on this,\u201d said Jonathan Chavez, co-founder of SocialSphere Inc.\n\nSome generational divides emerged in the survey, especially on the importance of \u201cAmerican history\u201d: 73% of Gen X and 79% of baby boomers called it \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important,\u201d but only 58% of Gen Z and millennials said the same.\n\nAlso, more Democrats (52%) than Republicans (39%) said \u201cChange the Status Quo\u201d is important, while 82% of Republicans said \u201cRespect America\u201d should be a top goal, compared to 58% of Democrats.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans largely agreed on a variety of educational items, including the direction of public schools. Overall, only about 1 in 10 voters feels U.S. public schools would be a \u201cmodel of excellence\u201d in 2040.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead on education, few people are optimistic about the future,\u201d said John Della Volpe, the poll\u2019s designer and director.\n\nBut Americans are looking to other models, either. Thirty percent of voters say they prefer public schools, 18% prefer religious schools and 13% prefer charter schools.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
