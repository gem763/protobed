While there appears to have been a test of a Pukguksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), it\u2019s unclear whether it was fired from an underwater submarine or just some kind of platform.\n\n\u201cThe missile, believed to be a type of Pukkuksong, a North Korean SLBM, was fired from off the east coast near Wonsan in an easterly direction at 7:11 a.m. and flew around 280 miles at a maximum altitude of about 565 miles,\u201d said American news agency UPI, citing South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\u201cThe high altitude means the missile was fired at a high angle, and if it had been fired at a normal angle, it would have flown a much longer distance.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fox News is reporting that unidentified American sources believe the missile was fired from a surface barge or an underwater platform. That would be a much less technically demanding achievement than launching a missile from a submarine beneath the waves.\n\nFor its part, North Korea\u2019s Korea Central News Agency merely reported that the missile was fired in \u201cvertical mode,\u201d and that \u201cthe test-firing scientifically and technically confirmed the key tactical and technical indexes of the newly-designed ballistic missile and had no adverse impact on the security of neighboring countries.\u201d\n\nYet another North Korean missile launch is almost a yawner. What\u2019s more troubling is that the missile landed in Japanese waters.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "From land? From sea? From a submarine?
