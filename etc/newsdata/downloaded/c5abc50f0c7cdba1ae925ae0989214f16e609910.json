Two years ago, Bo Bigelow and I weren\u2019t entirely sure. We are both fathers to children with rare diseases, USP7 and Menkes disease. We both had short documentaries about our kids we wanted the world to see. We met at the Global Genes conference in 2015 and had kept in touch. One conversation dealt with the best places to show films like these. My film had done the film festival circuit, and I had learned that in many ways, the best audiences were not to be found at a mainstream festival, but instead at medical conferences. So I set about screening my film \u201cMenkes Disease: Finding Help and Hope\u201d to those audiences. Still, Bo and I lamented that while the audience of researchers, doctors and bio pharma industry might be ideal, the conferences were often difficult and expensive for patients and advocates to attend.\n\nRelated:\u200b Your Child Might Have a Rare Disease When...\n\nWas there a way to combine the ease and appeal of a mainstream film festival with the targeted audience of the conferences?\n\nWe had more than a few doubts. Chiefly, was this too niche?\n\nWould we even find enough films?\n\nView photos The filmmaker with their son, near the video camera More\n\nRelated:\u200b What Not to Do When You See a Sick Person in Public\n\nI had experience founding and running another film festival. It was a general interest festival of short films. As I was beginning that festival, I received some advice that I should probably narrow my focus to give the festival a unique identity and let it stand apart from the thousands of other film festivals \u2014 maybe a Victorian Steampunk film festival. I didn\u2019t take the advice then, and that festival did pretty well, running for 10 years. But I obviously never forgot that advice either. And it kept coming to mind as we embarked on Disorder: The Rare Disease Film Festival.\n\nMany moments of doubt had me thinking our new festival would suffer from the opposite extreme \u2014 having too narrow a focus.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say now, in hindsight of our successful 2017 festival in Boston, but we need not have worried. We received a lot of films. And interest from the audience and sponsors was great enough that we expanded our plan from a one-day event to two days. This meant we could screen 30 films, all telling stories of life with rare diseases like Niemann Pick type C, SMA, Morquio A, EB, dup15q, NGLY1, cystic fibrosis and dozens more.\n\nRelated:\u200b What Happened After We Were Told Our Daughter's Rare Condition Had No Cure\n\nWe had tapped into a pent up need for the rare disease community.
