And he seems to be facing off with the State Department what may turn into a messy finger-pointing showdown.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Giuliani reportedly had multiple phone calls with CNN from a room at Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. As far as the actual content of the whistleblower complaint that was made public this morning, he said that he has \"no knowledge of any of that crap.\" In the memo of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Giuliani is mentioned specifically by both presidents, notably in reference to investigating the business connections of former president Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nGiuliani maintains that he reached out to Ukrainian officials on behalf of the State Department\u2014a claim that the State Department has denied. In a statement, a spokesman said,\"Mr. Giuliani is a private citizen and acts in a personal capacity as a lawyer for President Trump. He does not speak on behalf of the U.S. Government.\" But Giuliani told CNN that he has a \"nice little trail\" of text messages between him and Kurt Volker, the top U.S. diplomat with Ukraine, that he says backs up his own version of events.\n\nHe read one of these messages over the phone to CNN: \"Mr Mayor\u2014really enjoyed breakfast this morning. As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky. I suggest we schedule a call together on Monday\u2014maybe 10am or 11am Washington time? Kurt.\"\n\nGiuliani eventually met Yermak in person in Madrid on August 1, a meeting that the whistleblower complaint characterizes as a \"direct follow up\" to Trump's phone call with Zelensky. Giuliani claims that he had no indication he was following up on a call and that he reported everything he discussed back to the State Department. He told CNN, \"I don't think they'd thank me if I was interfering in foreign relations. And I don't think they'd call me and put me together with Yermak, which they indisputably did, even admitted it, if they weren't happy with what I did. But I can't imagine why they'd be unhappy. I told them everything that I did. There's nothing I did that they don't know.\"\n\nHe was less measured in a phone call to Elaina Plott at The Atlantic. Reportedly sounding out of breath, Giuliani nearly shouted into the phone, \"It is impossible that the whistleblower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero!\" He added, \"I\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government. Anything I did should be praised.\"\n\nHe went on to talk about the \"Deep State\" and the Clintons, before adding that he couldn't wait to see the State Department \"sink themselves.\" Unfortunately for Giuliani, Trump doesn't have the best track record of engaging in behavior that keeps his lawyers out of prison.\n\nChief Keith\n\nHow Dateline correspondent Keith Morrison became\u2014and stayed\u2014the granddaddy of true crime.\n\nOriginally Appeared on GQ\n\n", "description": "And he says he has a \"nice little trail\" of text messages that back him up.", "authors": ["Luke Darby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nng09Bhazrc9IcWVXYtHxQ--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gq_402/4b5210be99186f03b51b7835050dba39", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
