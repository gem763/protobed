(Lauren Pelley/CBC News)\n\nEven though she loves having cats around, Archambault says fewer are better in the wild.\n\n\"They suffer greatly,\" she explains. \"They can get into cat fights, there's disease... it's not a happy life for a cat living outside.\"\n\nPenny Cookson, who's been working with feral cats for the last decade, agrees.\n\n\"The life for a cat on the street is very difficult,\" says Cookson, the director of volunteer group Community Cats Toronto.\n\nStatistics show 75 per cent of feral kittens die within six months, she says, while the life expectancy for cats who reach adulthood is only two years.\n\n\"We have new colonies added every day,\" she adds. \"We're up to about 700, with 80 per cent of those in Toronto.\"\n\nNearby in Mississauga, some have dubbed the feral cat numbers an \"epidemic,\" while Cornwall in eastern Ontario is making strides to curb population growth after the city's residents complained about the number of cats strutting in the streets and wreaking havoc to private property.\n\nPenny Cookson, the director of volunteer group Community Cats Toronto, seen here with a small colony site in Toronto's west end. 'The life for a cat on the street is very difficult,' she says. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)\n\nGiven the high numbers of cats still on the streets, Cookson stresses the need for more data.\n\n\"It's very hard to measure how many cats there were when we started ... We didn't start with numbers, and we don't have solid numbers right now, but we do have indicators the number of feral cats are going down,\" she says.\n\nIn the new THS report, the team suggests further tracking feral cat populations through both stray intake numbers and data from neutering programs.\n\nPrevious studies have shown if those neutering programs are used, feral cat populations could drop by 10 to 40 per cent within a decade \u2014 which could mean the city's colony count could one day sit between 10 and 15 thousand, the report notes.\n\n\"These studies cannot just be a one-time thing,\" the report concludes.", "description": "It's a stat that might give you paws: A whopping 17,000 feral cats could be roaming the streets of Toronto.
