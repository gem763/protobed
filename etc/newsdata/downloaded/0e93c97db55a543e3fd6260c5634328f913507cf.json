I think it's clear he makes the decisions. And I think he feels very comfortable in that role.\"\n\nBolton said he was sure \"the leadership of North Korea is delighted I'm here today in a private capacity,\" rather than in the White House.\n\nThe big picture: Bolton argued that the U.S. should be more deeply engaged around the world and must strengthen ties with allies \u2014 views that runs contrary to Trump's.\n\nGo deeper: Bolton's chaotic White House departure", "description": "He said a military option should be on the table.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/KYMMp0hpOmG02c4J1-4y_cl-rZI=/0x381:4060x2662/1920x1080/2019/09/30/1569853965120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
