The future of humanity and indeed all life on earth now depends on us.\"\n\nDespite measures being put in place to reduce the impact it has on wildlife, tragic stories of its effects are unfortunately still commonplace.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nGumbo Limbo Nature Centre this week posted the heartbreaking tale of a small turtle which is one of many to wash up on the coastline needing help.\n\n\"Not such a happy Turtle Tuesday this week,\" said the centre based in Florida.\n\n\"It's washback season at Gumbo Limbo (which is when young sea turtles wash ashore). Unfortunately, not every washback survives.\"\n\n\"100% of our washbacks that didn't make it had plastic in their intestinal tracts.\n\n\"This turtle, which would fit in the palm of your hand, had eaten 104 pieces of plastic.\n\n\"This is a sad reminder that we all need to do our part to keep our oceans plastic free.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nPeople replying to the post expressed their sadness but thanked the centre for its valuable work.\n\nOne said: \"This breaks my heart! Have been trying to reduce the amount of plastic we use for years now.\"\n\nAnother added: \"So sad. Thank you for taking care of these beautiful creatures.\"\n\nReplying to one comment, Gumbo Limbo added: \"Many of these young turtles are dying from plastic impaction.\n\n\"The plastic plugs them up and causes them to go into septic shock. We perform necropsies on all turtles that die in our care which is how we determine cause of death.\n\n\"Plastic pollution is the sad world we live in now. We must do better.\"", "description": "A nature centre has said the case is 'a sad reminder that we all need to do our part to keep our oceans plastic free'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20449386.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_041019Slug_6721JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
