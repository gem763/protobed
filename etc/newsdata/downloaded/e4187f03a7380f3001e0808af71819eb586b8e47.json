Will he get Russia to do more dirty work? Instruct the justice department to arrest his opponent? Issue an executive order banning anyone not born in the US from voting? Start another war?\n\nBy the time the courts order him to cease whatever unconstitutional effort he\u2019s making to remain in office, the election may be over. Or he\u2019ll just ignore the courts.\n\nIt\u2019s almost too late for an impeachment. Besides, no president has ever been sent packing. Nixon resigned because he saw it coming. Trump would sooner start a civil war.\n\nAlso, being unstable is not an impeachable offense.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Reich", "Theguardian.Com Commentisfree Sep"], "top_image": ""}
