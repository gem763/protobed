He holds a lifetime deal valued at $1 billion with sports retail giant Nike, which saw its sales in China surge 27 percent to nearly $1.7 billion in its most recent fiscal quarter alone. James\u2019 signature sneaker line is one of Nike\u2019s most prominent offerings.\n\nJames\u2019 standing in China could also impact the future efforts of his media production company, SpringHill Entertainment. The firm is producing \u201cSpace Jam 2,\u201d the highly anticipated sequel to NBA legend Michael Jordan\u2019s original film, which will seek a massive return from Chinese audiences.\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d James told reporters on Monday night. \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and we say and what we do even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nNike earned more than $6 billion in revenue from China during its 2019 fiscal year. While the company has yet to publicly address the NBA\u2019s lingering issues in China, Nike stores in the country pulled Rockets merchandise from shelves in response to Morey\u2019s tweet, according to Reuters.\n\nStocks in this Article NKE NIKE INC. $94.79 -0.09 (-0.09%)\n\nJames\u2019 assertion that Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on Hong Kong drew widespread criticism among U.S. politicians and demonstrators on the ground in the city, some of whom were seen burning James\u2019 jersey in protest. The remarks were also seen as a reversal of course for James, who has emerged as a prominent community activist and one of the NBA\u2019s most outspoken voices for social justice causes in the United States, but opted not to weigh in on the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\u201cThis statement is unbelievable. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d? By Daryl Morey daring to express sympathy for democracy? News flash: people ARE being harmed - shot, beaten, gassed - right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote on Twitter.\n\nJames has repeatedly expressed support for former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who led national anthem protests against social injustice and police brutality. Later, Kaepernick sued the NFL\u2019s owners for allegedly colluding to keep him off the field.\n\n\u201cKap stood for something that was bigger than him,\u201d James said on his HBO series \u201cThe Shop\u201d in March after Kaepernick settled his lawsuit against the NFL. \u201cHe sacrificed. How many people can wake up and say \u2018You know what, I\u2019ll give up everything that I\u2019ve worked for my whole life, for the better of the conversation? I\u2019m gonna lose everything I\u2019ve got personally to better the conversation?'\u201d\n\nA prominent critic of the Trump administration, James famously called the president a \u201cbum\u201d after he engaged in a war of words with Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry. More recently, James hosted California Gov. Gavin Newsom on \u201cThe Shop\u201d for a discussion on his decision to sign a bill allowing the state\u2019s college athletes to sign endorsement deals without penalty.\n\nSocial media users pointed out that James tweeted a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. in January 2018, which said \u201cour lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\u201d James remarks drew widespread praise on Chinese social media platform Weibo, with one video amassing nearly 100 million views, according to Variety.\n\nJames later sought to clarify his remarks on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Lakers and Brooklyn Nets participated in the NBA\u2019s promotional tour in China earlier this month, which took place just days after Morey\u2019s tweet. The Chinese government mandated that the NBA cancel media availability for its two preseason games there, including Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s scheduled press conference.\n\nNearly all of the NBA\u2019s Chinese sponsors suspended ties with the league over Morey\u2019s tweet, including the league\u2019s exclusive streaming partner, Tencent Sports. The media firm briefly stopped airing NBA games, but has since resumed broadcasts.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "As the NBA\u2019s Chinese sponsors and fans closely watch the league\u2019s ongoing response to Morey\u2019s remark, James has a clear financial incentive to maintain a positive image in the region.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201910/2886/0/0/854081161001_6095087196001_6095090330001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
