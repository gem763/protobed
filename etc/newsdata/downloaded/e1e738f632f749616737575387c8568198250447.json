The graph shows the so-called 'nine-dash line', which is used by China to lay claims to most of the resource-rich sea, part of which is also claimed by Hanoi\n\nThe movie tells a story of how a Chinese teenager helps a yeti return to his home. The film is a joint production from DreamWorks and China's Pearl Studio and debuted in Vietnam on Oct. 4\n\nWhat is China's 'nine-dash line' in the South China Sea? The nine-dash line is a maritime boundary in the South China Sea drawn up by China, which claims to own the territory inside the line. However, this is disputed by many Asian countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. The U-shaped line was initially claimed by the government of the Republic of China in 1947. In 1992, the Communist Party of China adopted the boundary while updating its law on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone, according to book Strategic Regions in 21st Century Power Politics. Chinese passports issued from 2012 onwards feature the Chinese map printed with the nine-dash line on three pages. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that there was no legal basis for much of China's claims to the area. The Chinese government has strongly objected to the ruling.\n\nThe U-shaped line appears on a map of the South China Sea in a scene in the film - released in Vietnam as 'Everest: The Little Snowman' - which is about a Chinese teenager helping a yeti return to his home.\n\nThe movie is a joint production from DreamWorks and China's Pearl Studio and was released in Vietnam on October 4, but the country's main cinema franchise CGV said it would no longer show the film after it was notified about the map.\n\n'CGV seriously admit our mistake due to negligence... this is a serious issue,' the South Korean-owned firm said.\n\nAll films in communist Vietnam must be approved by censors who screen for gratuitous violence, suggestive sex scenes or politically-sensitive material.\n\nState media earlier quoted the head of the censorship body saying she was sorry for letting the error slip through.\n\n'I will claim responsibility' for the mistake, said Nguyen Thu Ha, the head of Vietnam's Cinema Department, quoted by Thanh Nien newspaper.\n\nHa said she would remind her department 'to be very vigilant... to be more prudent' in the future.\n\nThe head of Vietnam's censorship body has said sorry for 'letting the error slip through'. 'I will claim responsibility' for the mistake, said Nguyen Thu Ha, quoted by Thanh Nien newspaper\n\nVietnam and Beijing have competing territorial claims in the flashpoint South China Sea\n\nPhotos of the faux pas circulated on social media Monday, showing the scene featuring the nine-dash line crossed out with a red 'X' along with angry comments.\n\n'Please sack the person in charge of censorship for this movie,' said Facebook user Pham Tan Phong.\n\nAnother said: 'We cannot accept these blatant acts, especially regarding sensitive things like the current sea disputes'.\n\nVietnam's censorship department refused to comment on the issue Monday, and DreamWorks did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina claims the majority of the South China Sea.

One of the cut scenes featured a designer bag with a map of the world showing disputed South China Sea islands under Beijing's control.\n\nThis year's hit 'Joker', starring Joaquin Phoenix, was also trimmed to exclude a scene of supporters rallying around the DC Comics villain -- possibly to avoid any suggestion of a popular uprising or personality cult.", "description": "Vietnam has pulled the animated film 'Abominable' from theatres over a scene featuring a map of the South China Sea showing Beijing's claims in the flash-point waterway.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19695198-0-image-a-103_1571062261545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
