Let me know if you appreciate this or have suggestions, and I\u2019ll make sure it evolves as needed to be useful resource.\n\nThis week, there was an abundance of spacesuit news, and signs from multiple operators that there\u2019s going to be an orbital traffic boom in the immediate future. Also, we\u2019re heading into the annual International Astronautical Congress (IAC) this coming week, so expect a lot more news starting tomorrow.\n\nNASA showed off a brand new generation of spacesuit, including the one that the first American woman and next American man to set foot on the Moon will don for that historic moment. The new Artemis suits are designed to scale from essentially the smallest to the largest possible adult human frame, which NASA touts as a way to make the astronaut program more accessible to a wider range of Americans. The agency should be going out of its way to fix that, because of what happened that led to item #2 this week.\n\nFor the first time, NASA is looking to outsource the full production of these Artemis-generation spacesuits (including the Orion survival suit, which was also revealed today and will be worn only during flight aboard the Orion capsule). To that end, it has put out a request for input from industry about their design and development ahead of setting up a proper RFP.\n\nAs I alluded above, there was a very good reason that NASA really emphasized how inclusive its Artemis suit designs are: The agency had to cancel a first all-woman spacewalk earlier this year because it didn\u2019t have the right amount of properly sized spacesuits on board the International Space Station. It sent one up in June, however, and that historic moment happened this past week, with Koch and Meir performing a roughly seven-hour spacewalk to repair a power controller.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of the 12,000 it\u2019s already had cleared, which makes for a total potential constellation size of 42,000. That\u2019s about 8x the number of satellites currently in orbit, across all orbital zones. It\u2019s a move that is definitely raising the ire of both industry and space researchers, because it\u2019ll make it a lot more complicated to ensure orbital spacecraft avoid collisions, and it could potentially obscure the view of the stars from Earth. SpaceX says it has taken steps to ensure it can avoid both problems, but not everyone is convinced.\n\nMeanwhile, startup Swarm has been granted FCC approval to deploy its own, much-smaller constellation of 150 satellites. Swarm isn\u2019t competing directly with SpaceX\u2019s Starlink \u2013 it wants to provide low-bandwidth IoT connectivity. And while it isn\u2019t looking to put up a huge volume of spacecraft, there was some concern that its toaster-sized satellites might be too small to track and present a risk that way.\n\nNew Zealand-born and lately U.S.-headquartered Rocket Lab was successful in launching its fifth Electron rocket this year. The startup\u2019s success was more a proof point for its business model than its technology, however, since the payload that flew aboard this mission was actually one that wasn\u2019t slated to go up until much later in the queue. Rocket Lab\u2019s original client for this one had to drop out due to unfortunate circumstances, and Rocket Lab was able to get client Astro Digital an earlier ride. This kind of late-stage payload swap has not typically been a strength of the established commercial space launch industry.\n\nRichard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic will begin ferrying wealthy paying tourists to the very edge of space next year, if all goes to plan, and now we know what they\u2019ll be wearing when they do: Under Armour. The sportswear company and Branson\u2019s space enterprise unveiled the new suits at a flashy special event featuring the first tourists who have reserved $250,000 tickets aboard Virgin Galactic\u2019s atmosphere-skimming spacecraft.\n\nLockheed Martin has been in the commercial space business since there has been a commercial space business to be in, and around a decade ago it established a corporate venture fund to make strategic bets on startups. I sat down with the fund\u2019s GM and Executive Director J. Christopher Moran to talk about what the fund looks for in startups \u2013 and the industry giant is a lot more interested in early stage companies that you might have thought.
