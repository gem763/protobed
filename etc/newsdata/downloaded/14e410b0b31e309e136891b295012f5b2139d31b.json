Elijah E. Cumming, who died Thursday at age 68, was remembered as a moral voice of conscience in a divisive era \u2014 a leader who fought for civil rights and took on the White House as a prominent figure in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nBorn to a family of Southern sharecroppers, Cummings was a formidable orator who advocated for the poor in his black-majority district of Baltimore: \u201cSteely yet compassionate, principled yet open to new perspectives,\u201d former President Barack Obama said.\n\nIn a testament to Cummings\u2019 ability to forge friendships across the aisle during a time of intense political polarization, tributes poured in from across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted his \u201ccondolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see firsthand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader.\u201d He also ordered flags at the White House and other federal buildings to be flown at half-staff through Friday to honor Cummings.\n\nEarlier this year, Cummings defended his city against Trump, who criticized the Democrat\u2019s district as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d Cummings replied that government officials must stop making \u201chateful, incendiary comments\u201d that distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\n\u201cThose in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led investigations of the president\u2019s government dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to Trump\u2019s family members serving in the White House.\n\nObama, whose 2008 presidential bid counted Cummings as an early supporter, said he and his wife, Michelle, were \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the loss of their friend.\n\n\u201cHe showed us all not only the importance of checks and balances within our democracy, but also the necessity of good people stewarding it,\u201d Obama said.\n\nWith Cummings\u2019 death, Americans \u201chave lost a great leader at a time of crisis in our democracy,\u201d civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis said.\n\n\u201cWhen this nation needed him most, he became a moral voice \u2018crying in the wilderness,\u2019 and his words and actions called a reluctant nation to conscience,\u201d the Georgia Democrat said in a statement.\n\nWords of praise also came from Cummings\u2019 Republican admirers.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Cummings as \u201ca living legend in his native Baltimore\u201d and said he \u201ccounted close friends and admirers from all across the political spectrum.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called Cummings \u201ca respected adversary\u201d who was tough but fair.\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, a veteran Democrat from New York, will for now take over leadership of the House oversight committee, according to a senior Democratic leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the decision publicly.\n\nThe committee, authorized to investigate virtually any part of the federal government, is one of three conducting the House impeachment probe of Trump. Cummings was among the three chairmen to sign a letter seeking documents into whether Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate the family of Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden. The committees have issued subpoenas of witnesses after the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the impeachment probe and have jointly been meeting behind closed doors to hear testimony.\n\nSeparately, Cummings led an effort to gain access to Trump\u2019s financial records. His committee subpoenaed records from Mazars USA, an accounting firm that provided services to Trump. The panel demanded documents from 2011 to 2018 as it probed Trump\u2019s reporting of his finances and potential conflicts of interest. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled the records must be turned over.\n\nCummings died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications of longstanding health problems, according to his office. He had hoped to return to Congress within about a week after a medical procedure for which he hadn\u2019t offered details. He\u2019d previously been treated for heart and knee issues.\n\nHis widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, chairwoman of Maryland\u2019s Democratic Party, said in a statement: \u201cHe worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation\u2019s diversity was our promise, not our problem.\u201d\n\nCummings was born Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told him he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d Cummings told The Associated Press in 1996, shortly before winning his seat in Congress. \u201cMy whole life changed. I became very determined.\u201d\n\nIt steeled Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer, but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland statehouse, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become the first black House speaker pro tem, the member who presides in the speaker\u2019s absence. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.\n\nCummings began his long push for civil rights at age 11, when he helped integrate a swimming pool in Baltimore. This year, during a speech to the American Bar Association in April, Cummings recalled how he and other black children organized protests with help from their recreation leader and the NAACP.\n\nEvery day for a week, when the children tried to get into the pool, they were spit upon, threatened and called names, Cummings said; he said he was cut by a bottle thrown from an angry crowd.\n\n\u201cThe experience transformed my entire life,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He believed in much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\nCummings then chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nIn 2015, when the death of black Baltimore resident Freddie Gray sparked the city\u2019s worst riots in decades, Cummings carried a bullhorn in the streets and urged crowds to go home and respect a curfew. He spoke at Gray\u2019s funeral, asking lawmakers in the church to stand up to show Gray\u2019s mother they would seek justice.\n\n\u201cI want justice, oceans of it. I want fairness, rivers of it. That\u2019s what I want. That\u2019s all I want,\u201d Cummings said, quoting from the Bible.\n\n___\n\nWitte reported from Annapolis.
