Even racing pigeons have been banned.\n\nMedia censorship - always stringent in China - has been tightened even further, with broadcasters given a set list of programmes to play and internet censors removing any online criticism of the Communist Party or its leaders.\n\nIn the footsteps of Mao\n\nBy Robin Brant, BBC News, Beijing\n\nStanding in the exact spot where Mao declared the foundation of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping was the only one among the country's senior leaders wearing the Mao-like suit.\n\nPresident Xi made absolutely no secret of his desire to evoke memories of the country's revolutionary founding father.\n\nHis brief speech touched on familiar themes: unity, on-going struggle, China's inexorable progress.\n\nThen he was carried along, standing, in a car for a lengthy review of the military parade. He waved occasionally, they replied with shouts of loyalty.\n\nMilitary leaders have said this isn't \"muscle flexing\" but note that this key moment, this celebration of 70 years of communist control, is focused overwhelmingly on military might.\n\nWhat is China celebrating?\n\nSeventy years ago, Chairman Mao announced the birth of the PRC after the Communist Party of China defeated the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) - or National Party.\n\nThe two sides had been locked in a costly civil war since the 1920s, after the collapse of the imperial system.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I was so proud and excited to join the parade'\n\nThe events would show that China had \"stood up, grown rich and become stronger over the past decades\", officials said.\n\n\"The main theme is to tell Chinese stories and express the Chinese people's confidence in the party and the country,\" said Zhang Ge, one of the officials responsible for the anniversary celebrations.\n\nChina has said it is developing an entirely new political system - \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" - and that it has raised millions out of poverty.\n\nGetty Timeline of modern China 1949 Mao declares the founding of the People's Republic of China\n\n1966-76 Cultural Revolution brings social and political upheaval\n\n1977 Deng Xiaoping initiates major reforms of China's economy\n\n1989 Army crushes Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests\n\n2010 China becomes the world's second-largest economy\n\n2018Xi Jinping is cleared to be president for life\n\nTo its critics though, China is a deeply oppressive country turning back progress on global human rights. It has been widely criticised for its lack of democracy, suppression of rights and any sign of dissent, an unfair justice system with a 99% conviction rate, and in recent years the mass detention of ethnic Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, among other groups.\n\nWhat is happening in Hong Kong?\n\nPolice said they had received credible intelligence that activists were planning a major violent escalation in the city, setting fire to shops and train stations.\n\nHong Kong was in lockdown in the early hours of Tuesday, and some 6,000 officers were deployed in the territory. Several metro stations and shopping centres were closed. An annual fireworks display had previously been cancelled.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam is currently attending the festivities in Beijing.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Carrie Lam is seen with other Chinese leaders\n\nHong Kong has been a part of China since 1997 but has its own system of law and government - known as One Country Two Systems.\n\nIn a speech given on the eve of the 70th anniversary celebrations, President Xi maintained to \"fully and faithfully implement\" the principles of this system.\n\nBut in recent years, there has been increasing opposition to what has been seen as the growing influence of Beijing on Hong Kong's society and politics.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A surge of protests in Hong Kong could overshadow the celebrations in Beijing\n\nHong Kong always sees anti-Beijing protests on 1 October, and this year they are expected to be larger than ever, because of the months of unrest triggered by proposed changes to the extradition law.\n\nThe changes would have made it possible for China to extradite people to the mainland from Hong Kong, something opponents felt put Hong Kongers at risk of persecution in unfair trials.\n\nFor nearly four months, protesters have taken to the streets - at times in the millions.\n\nThe proposed changes to the extradition law have officially been scrapped but that has failed to quell the unrest which has now evolved into an existential battle over Hong Kong's future.\n\nThe protesters are now demanding full democracy for the territory and for police to be held accountable over the use of force, among other issues.", "description": "A huge parade is taking place in Beijing, but risks being overshadowed by unrest in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07prq68.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
