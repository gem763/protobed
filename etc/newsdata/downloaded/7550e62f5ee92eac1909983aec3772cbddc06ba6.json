To celebrate the milestone, Vulture combed through Saul Austerlitz\u2019s new tell-all book, Generation Friends, to discover some tidbits about the Central Perk sextet that have remained pretty elusive since 1994, as well as behind-the-scenes gossip and alternate-universe moments that could\u2019ve altered the show\u2019s DNA as we know it. There\u2019s still no talk about a reunion (duh), so here\u2019s a baker\u2019s dozen of fun facts to tide us over instead.\n\n1. NBC was mostly hands-off after ordering Friends\u2019 pilot, but it was insistent on one major suggestion: the addition of an older secondary character who could run into the six pals at the coffeehouse and give them \u201cadvice about their lives.\u201d Showrunners David Crane and Marta Kauffman, while not thrilled about this tweak, made a good-faith attempt to incorporate the new character into the show, and Pat the Cop \u2014 an older NYPD officer who frequented Central Perk \u2014 was born. An actor was even cast in the role, but Crane and Kauffman hated the resulting script so much that they \u201cpleaded with NBC to drop the idea.\u201d The network eventually relented, and Pat the Cop was permanently scrubbed.\n\n2. When writing the pilot, Crane and Kauffman initially envisioned Joey (then conceived as a Chicago city slicker) and Monica as the show\u2019s central romantic couple, as opposed to Ross and Rachel. It would\u2019ve unfolded like this: Joey, a \u201cperpetual horndog,\u201d would\u2019ve eventually been lured and \u201ctamed\u201d by Monica as he continued to climb up in the world of acting. Crane, however, found himself \u201cbored\u201d by this version of Joey; he retooled Joey to be a funnier and warmer character within the friend group, and dropped the romance with Monica altogether.\n\n3. Before Friends settled on the now-iconic theme song \u201cI\u2019ll Be There for You\u201d by the Rembrandts, R.E.M.\u2019s Michael Stipe was approached numerous times to record a theme, but he politely declined every offer. In fact, R.E.M.\u2019s \u201cShiny Happy People\u201d served as the original pilot theme, but the Rembrandts\u2019s ditty was ultimately deemed more suitable.\n\n4. Anita Barone, who was originally cast as Ross\u2019s ex-wife, Carol \u2014 and appeared in one episode of the show \u2014 demanded her role to be larger. Barone\u2019s behavior got her quickly replaced with Jane Sibbett.\n\n5. Crane tried to stop season five\u2019s \u201cThe One Where Rachel Smokes\u201d from airing, due to an exceedingly poor run-through with all of the plotlines (which included Rachel taking up smoking to impress her new boss at Ralph Lauren, and Ross\u2019s son and Joey auditioning for the same commercial). The network refused, and the episode aired in the shape it was in. Crane considers it to be the show\u2019s weakest episode.\n\n6. Crane\u2019s other biggest Friends regret was encouraging the cast to do multiple commercials for Diet Coke after the massive success of the first season. The commercials \u2014 which were crafted by the show\u2019s writers and involved the characters being interrogated by police about a missing Diet Coke \u2014 were brought on by an enormous payday, but Crane later argued that it \u201cput the show at risk\u201d for commercialization.\n\n7. While it happened infrequently, the six main actors were allowed to nix plotlines that they didn\u2019t like or \u201ccouldn\u2019t stomach\u201d for their characters. For instance, Matthew Perry said no to a story where Chandler would sneak into a gay bar because he loved the chef\u2019s tuna melts.\n\n8. Friends was keen on recruiting Owen Wilson as a guest star (the role wasn\u2019t specified), but owing to a subsequent interview Wilson did where he admitted that his \u201cbiggest fault was giving writers a hard time,\u201d the offer was revoked to avoid unnecessary drama.\n\n9. The writers\u2019 room was consistently divided over the character of Paolo, who had a purely sexual relationship with Rachel throughout Friends\u2019 first season. Some of the writers believed \u201cthe Latin lover\u201d was a tired trope, while others believed it was fun and realistic. Before he was written as an Italian Lothario, though, there were serious discussions about giving Paolo an Inuit background. \u201cThe prospect of a stud in mukluks,\u201d apparently, \u201cwas ultimately deemed to be a bridge too far for audiences.\u201d\n\n10. Although guest stars rarely caused trouble for the show, Jon Favreau, who portrayed Monica\u2019s tech-billionaire boyfriend Pete in a season-three arc, was annoyed at how the writers crafted his character as a \u201csweet but geeky overgrown kid.\u201d (Favreau also auditioned for the role of Chandler years prior.) He began to push back at these nerd-chic aspects, and demanded that the writers make him \u201ccooler\u201d than they originally intended. Because of Favreau\u2019s persistence, the writers ended up incorporating a plotline about Pete wanting to become an ultimate fighting champion.\n\n11. Charlie Sheen, years before his bizarre public downfall, had a memorable guest-star role as Phoebe\u2019s Navy sailor boyfriend who willingly gets the chicken pox from her in an act of love. Sheen was so terrified to be on Friends that the episode\u2019s director had to pause one of his scenes due to Sheen\u2019s legs shaking uncontrollably. His brother, Emilio Estevez, also had to be taken out of the audience to calm him down, \u201crub his back,\u201d and encourage him to return to the stage.\n\n12. Chris Isaak appeared in the coveted post\u2013Super Bowl episode alongside Julia Roberts in season two, with the show believing they secured massive star power by casting Isaak as a musician love interest for Phoebe. However, when he was instructed to pause for a roar of excitement from the audience upon his first scene, he was met with dead silence \u2014 they had no idea who he was. The showrunners, to this day, consider Isaak to be the biggest casting \u201cmiscalculation.\u201d\n\n13. The show took a notable season-four trip to London, where they filmed in front of a live British studio audience as well as exterior shots around Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London. The visit might not have happened, though, without the cunning generosity of Richard Branson: He agreed to provide nearly 100 first-class tickets for the cast and crew on his Virgin Atlantic airline, but only if Friends gave him a small role. The showrunners agreed to his terms, and the writers were able to cast him as a souvenir salesman who cajoles Joey into buying a silly hat. Branson\u2019s poor acting abilities ended up becoming one of the biggest challenges of the London shoot, as he couldn\u2019t \u201ccredibly\u201d deliver his lines without help.", "description": "\u201cGeneration Friends,\u201d a new book by Saul Austerlitz about \u201cFriends,\u201d gives insight into new facts, gossip, and alternate-universe moments.
