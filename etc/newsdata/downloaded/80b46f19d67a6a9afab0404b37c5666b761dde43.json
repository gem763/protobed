But it has not been independently scientifically shown to be non-toxic, and the company selling it is now under investigation.\n\nThe 2mm-long polyphagous shothole borer, which is native to South-east Asia, bores into the trees and deposits a fungus, which - depending on the tree species and its health - can kill the tree. It has been in eight provinces so far, with only Limpopo in the clear at the moment.\n\nA Parys-based company, Pan African Farms, claims to have a cure for the beetle and its fungus. CEO Piet Meyer says he stumbled across the solution when he was trying to find a remedy for his psoriasis, a skin condition, which is now in remission. Since media interest last month, he says, his company has been \u201cinundated\u201d with interest. One arborist is treating 200 trees a day with Pan African's cure, he says.\n\nMeyer told Business Insider South Africa that the product was registered in July under legislation which governs remedies in agriculture.\n\nHowever, scientists have concerns that the \"cure\" had not undergone rigorous scientific testing in a real-world setting. Wilhelm de Beer, a fungal biologist at the Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, warned the idea that a cure exists could also hamper the funding needed to fight the beetle.\n\nMeyer says that the constituent ingredients in his product are not toxic, and so neither is the final fungicide \u2013 but this has not been tested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking here about an emergency,\u201d he says. \u201c[The law] has an emergency protocol which allows you to get approval on the basic proof that the stuff works and, thereafter, you have two or three years time in which to submit conclusive evidence of toxicity.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe law in question governs agricultural crops, but not necessarily trees grown in residential areas.\n\nWhen asked for details of who within the department signed off on the product, whether Pan African Farms had in fact been granted an emergency waiver, and whether the product had been tested for safety, the department of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries responded only: \u201cPlease note that the department is still busy investigating the false claims made by the applicant.\u201d\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\n\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "A tiny beetle, which carries a fungus with it, is threatening thousands of trees around the country.
