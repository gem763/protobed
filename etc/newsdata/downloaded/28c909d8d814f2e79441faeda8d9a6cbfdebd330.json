That about-face came after Unizo had earlier welcomed the \u201cwhite knight\u201d bid from SoftBank-backed (9984.T) Fortress Investment Group.\n\nPreviously a relatively obscure hotelier, Unizo is now being seen by foreign investors as a prominent battleground for corporate governance and whether Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push for greater transparency and reform has taken root.\n\n\u201cWe are highly concerned about the lack of disclosure and the risk of conflicts of interest that have appeared in Unizo\u2019s handling to date of the tender offer bids,\u201d Elliott, which owns 13.14% of Unizo, said. It was referring to both the Fortress offer, and an earlier, hostile bid from H.I.S. Co (9603.T), which has since been withdrawn.\n\n\u201cNo answers, or answers that do not directly address shareholders\u2019 concerns, will only deepen the misgivings that shareholders are starting to have,\u201d Elliott said.", "description": "The top shareholder in Japan's Unizo Holdings <3258.T> on Wednesday pressed the hotel operator to explain its abrupt change of heart toward a takeover offer, citing concern about a lack of disclosure and the risk of conflicts of interest.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
