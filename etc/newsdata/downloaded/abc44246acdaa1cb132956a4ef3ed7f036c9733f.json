He left Syria in 2012 and arrived in Germany in July 2014.\n\nThe second suspect, Eyad A., is charged with facilitating the torture of at least 30 opposition activists arrested after intelligence agents opened fire on an anti-Assad demonstration in Douma near Damascus in Autumn of 2011.\n\nEyad A., who left Syria in 2013 and arrived in Germany in April 2018, worked for an intelligence unit led by Anwar R. Both suspects had applied for asylum in Germany.\n\n\u201cEyad A. knew before the arrest of demonstrators of the systematic and brutal torture methods practiced at the facility,\u201d the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office (GBA) said in a statement.\n\nNo date was set for a trial and no comment was available from the two Syrians.\n\nEfforts to prosecute members of Assad\u2019s government have repeatedly failed, as Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Russia and China have also vetoed attempts to give the ICC a mandate to set up a special tribunal for Syria.\n\nBut human rights lawyers in Europe have been collecting testimonies from survivors among the hundreds of thousand of Syrians who have sought refuge, mainly in Germany and Sweden, to prosecute members of Assad\u2019s government.\n\nGerman prosecutors last year issued an international arrest warrant for the head of Syrian Air force Intelligence on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nSyrian human rights lawyers in Germany say their goal is to collect enough evidence from survivors of torture and sexual violence, as well as from the families of victims to convince German prosecutors to issue an arrest warrant for Assad.", "description": "German prosecutors have charged two Syrians with crimes against humanity that include torturing and killing opposition activists, setting the stage for the first trial of suspected members of President Bashar al-Assad's feared security service.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
