Kellyanne Conway shots back to reporter", "language": "en", "text": "Kellyanne Conway argued on Friday she never threatened a reporter who wrote an article that mentioned her husband was a critic of Donald Trump, adding that if she threatened someone, they'd know it.\n\n'I never threatened anyone. Don't use those words,' Conway told reporters in the White House driveway.\n\n'It's not a threat. I never threatened her,' she said. 'Don't use that word if it's not true ... Do not.'\n\n'If I threaten somebody, you'll know it. If I threaten someone you'll know it,' she added. 'OK? And so don't do that.'\n\nConway also was asked what she meant by threatening to investigate the reporter's personal life. She did not answer.\n\n'Don't use the word threaten. Don't use the word investigate and stop being so silly. Honestly stop being so silly,' Conway said.\n\nThe White House counselor also argued she said nothing on the call she hasn't said publicly before.\n\n'That is not reporting. I have said many times there is not one thing on that call I have not said publicly including here in the driveway to all of you,' Conway said.\n\nShe called a Washington Examiner reporter on Thursday to scold her about an article she wrote that mentioned Conway's husband George is a critic of President Trump.\n\nKellyanne Conway shrugged off her phone call with a reporter who she berated and said it's nothing she hasn't said in public before\n\nGeorge Conway frequently tweets criticism of President Trump\n\nConway also said she didn't think the call was off the record - a term used between reporters and sources to designate that the information given cannot be used in the journalist's story.\n\n'I didn't say the call was off the record. She must have thought it was off the record because she asked if I wanted to say anything on the record,' Conway said.\n\nShe was citing a section of the call where, after she criticized reporter Caitlin Yilek for the story, Yilek offered to let Conway 'dispute that on the record.'\n\n'Would you like to dispute that on the record? I would be happy to put that in my story,' Yilek told her, according to a transcript released by the Washington Examiner.\n\n'Nobody read your story. I'm just making the point - I'm just asking you how you do your job, and you're telling me you don't have to explain yourself to me? And that this is what your editor asks you to do? I'm trying to decide what that is. Does your editor ask you to characterize other people's feelings? Because that's weird,' Conway told her in response.\n\nConway argued the main purpose of the call to the reporter was to complain about the Examiner characterized her feelings.\n\n'Don't impugn things to me. I asked her about how she is familiar with my feelings without her ever having met me,' she told reporters at the White House Friday morning.\n\nThe Examiner article Conway complained about wrote: 'Conway has been in the middle of Trump's barbs with her husband, George, a conservative lawyer who frequently makes headlines for his criticism of the president. George Conway said earlier this month that White House aides should resign unless they can 'have some moderating or blunting effect' on Trump. He refused to discuss his wife, who has worked for Trump since the 2016 presidential campaign.'\n\nAfter it was published, Conway ranted against Yilek for the piece.\n\nThe recording of the call was released Thursday afternoon as the Examiner's Editor in Chief Hugo Gurdon defended his writer and accused Conway of 'abusing, bullying, and threatening' the reporter.\n\nConway also appeared on Fox News Friday morning where she denied bullying the reporter and said 'old school reporters' agreed with her.\n\n'Of course not,' she said. 'What I said is there for everybody to listen to. A lot of reporters - particularly old school reporters - read it and contacted me and they have a very different opinion.'\n\n'I know I got 15 minutes of fame and gets clicks and kicks,' she added.\n\nShe also said reporters that write about her husband and hers relationship are 'lazy.'\n\n'George and I agree on many big things. We disagree on many big things. None of that affects my job here and exactly none of that is anybody's business. There is my message again. I think people constantly covering that is lazy and it doesn't add to the conversation. That's all I asked her,' Conway said.\n\nGeorge Conway frequently takes to Twitter to criticize the president.\n\nHe was active on the social media platform in the past 24 hours, commenting on tweets and retweets that mentioned the president.\n\n'Unless the term were used to describe an evil, remorseless, sadistic, pathologically lying narcissistic sociopath. In that case, the term would actually fit,' he wrote about a tweet that mentioned Trump criticized fellow Republicans.\n\nKellyanne Conway ripped into Washington Examiner reporter Cailtin Yilek in a seven-minute phone rant that was released Thursday, attacking her for writing about her husband George Conway's strained relationship with Donald Trump\n\nThe phone call recording was released Thursday. The Examiner's Editor in Chief Hugo Gurdon defended his writer and accused Conway of 'abusing, bullying, and threatening' the reporter\n\nAnd he retweeted a tweet with unsupported speculation that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell will tell the president he can't be assured of acquittal in the Senate during an impeachment trial.\n\n'This is absolutely correct, and @realDonaldTrump's going to turn into an even bigger freak show than he already is. By orders of magnitude. And that may seal his fate,' Conway wrote.\n\nConway also wrote an 11,500-word essay for The Atlantic earlier this month, arguing Trump is 'dangerously psychotic' and that makes him unfit for office.\n\nThe Washington Examiner article in question was about a Bloomberg report that suggested Trump was considering making Conway his White House Chief of Staff. In the story Yilek mentioned that George Conway has repeatedly criticized Trump and the president has attacked him in turn.\n\nTrump disputed this claim that he was making Kellyanne Conway his chief of staff, which she also disputed to reporters at the White House Friday morning.\n\n'I just am wondering why in God's earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway's tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff,' Kellyanne Conway said in the call.\n\n'Other than it looks to me like there's no original reporting here, you just read Twitter and other people's stuff, which I guess is why you don't pick up the phone when people call from the White House because if it's not on Twitter or it's not on cable TV, it's not real,' she added.\n\nHowever, Yilek defended her story arguing that mentioning George was relevant to the story.\n\n'In terms of mentioning George Conway, it's relevant context,' Yilek said.\n\n'I know it's just for clicks, but you're going to have to give me, like, a journalistic reason here, especially if you admit that you just are repeating what another news source said and the president disputed that anyway. So, it's sort of, like, doubly embarrassing. There's no original reporting,' Conway fired back.\n\n'If you're going to call yourself a reporter, let's see some reporting. There's no original reporting, and then, it's just lazy,' she continued.\n\nThe article in question was about a Bloomberg report that suggested Trump was considering making Conway his White House Chief of Staff. In the story Yilek mentioned that George Conway has repeatedly criticized Trump and the president has attacked him in turn\n\nGeorge tweets after the storm: An hour after that audio was released, George Conway tweeted 'I've learned a lot about narcissism over the past couple of years that I didn't know previously. In fact, I didn't know it had a label, although I had seen it without knowing it'\n\n'Do you talk about other people's spouses in your pieces. I'm looking around and I haven't learned a single thing from any one of your pieces,' Conway charged, leading Yilek to reply, 'Yes, my editor requires us to put in context about people's spouse and families when relevant.'\n\n'You're really going places. Let me tell you from something, from a powerful woman. Don't pull the crap where you're trying to undercut another woman based on who she's married to. He gets his power through me, if you haven't noticed. Not the other way around,' Conway said.\n\n'And if these are the quote standards unquote at the Washington Examiner, then yes I'd be happy to talk to your editor. But I've known your editor since before you were born,' she added.\n\nThen she accused Yilek of replying on men and one again boasted she was wields the power in her marriage.\n\nIn August 2018 Kellyanne told the Post that, 'I feel there's a part of [George Conway] that thinks I chose Donald Trump over him. Which is ridiculous. One is my work and one is my marriage.'\n\n'You can answer that question without your editors. You don't have to rely upon the men in your life and pretend somehow by way of reporting that I rely on the men in my life, which clearly isn't the case,' she said.\n\nLess than an hour after the audio was released, George Conway tweeted, 'I've learned a lot about narcissism over the past couple of years that I didn't know previously. In fact, I didn't know it had a label, although I had seen it without knowing it.In August 2018 Kellyanne told the Post that, 'I feel there's a part of him that thinks I chose Donald Trump over him.
