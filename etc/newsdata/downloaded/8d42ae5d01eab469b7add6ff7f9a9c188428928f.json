Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg \u2014 rolled out their plans to fight the threat of climate change. On Wednesday night, CNN held a marathon town hall where they discussed and debated their proposals.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump calls climate change a \u201choax\u201d and Hurricane Dorian, a storm that was likely intensified by the effects of climate change, rages on, the candidates are trying to meet our global calamity head-on \u2014 some with more ambitious plans than others.\n\nAhead, what the major 2020 contenders have said they would do about climate change if elected.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nThe Massachusetts senator, who has been edging her way to the top of the field all summer, has been focused on the connection between climate change and trade and manufacturing. In June, she introduced a $2 trillion green-manufacturing plan, which has three parts: the Green Apollo Program, which would allocate $400 billion over 10 years for clean-energy research and development and create a National Institutes of Clean Energy; a $1.5 trillion federal-procurement commitment to U.S.-made renewable-energy products; and a $100 billion \u201cGreen Marshall Plan\u201d that would encourage foreign investment in U.S. clean-energy products.\n\nOn Tuesday, Warren issued a plan that echoed the Green New Deal \u2014 adopting the proposal of \u201cclimate change candidate\u201d Gov. Jay Inslee, who dropped out of the race in August \u2014 calling for an additional $1 trillion investment over 10 years in the transition to 100% clean energy and to help workers in fossil fuel industries find green jobs. The \u201cI have a plan\u201d candidate has pledged to do away with carbon energy and wean the U.S. off nuclear power by 2035. At the CNN town hall, she warned Democrats not to get bogged down debating things like plastic vs. paper straws (important as they may be!), but to look at the bigger picture. \u201cThis is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we\u2019re all talking about,\u201d Warren said.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nOn Wednesday, the California senator unveiled her plan pledging $10 trillion to clean-energy transition. The goal is 100% of carbon-neutral electricity by 2030 and a 100% clean economy by 2045. She also proposed a progressively increasing carbon-pollution fee and putting an end to fossil fuel subsidies. At the CNN town hall, Harris promised to flex her prosecutorial muscle and urge the Department of Justice to go after oil and gas companies. She also said she will get rid of the Senate filibuster (read an explainer on that here) if Republicans don\u2019t cooperate on the Green New Deal.\n\nIn July, Harris teamed up with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Climate Equity Act, the goal of which is to ensure that any measure to fight climate change and its results benefits low-income and marginalized communities.\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nThe Minnesota senator announced a plan on Sunday that puts executive action front-and-center. In her first 100 days, she vowed to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and reenact the Obama-era policies rolled back by President Trump on car fuel efficiency standards and limits on carbon pollution. Her plan also includes a $1 trillion infrastructure package, through which she aims to make buildings more energy-efficient and climate-friendly. And, she wants to issue bonds to support clean-energy projects that she says could raise up to $50 billion and create over 1 million jobs. Like many of the other candidates, she wants to end fossil fuel subsidies and wean the U.S. off carbon by 2050.\n\nShe is also much more eager to compromise with Republicans, most of whom do not support spending money on these climate change proposals. At the CNN town hall, she warned Democrats that if they don\u2019t pay attention to how new climate policies may affect workers, \u201cit\u2019s going to be really hard to bring along those people who we need to win in the middle of the country.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden\n\nThe former vice president promised a $1.7 trillion investment in clean energy over 10 years, $400 billion of which would be dedicated to research and development. His goal is to achieve a clean-energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050. But his proposal has been criticized for not going far enough and relying on controversial \u201ccarbon capture\u201d technology, as well as investments in nuclear energy.", "description": "Mandatory Credit: Photo by Matt Baron/Shutterstock (10350880bj) Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke Second 2020 Democratic Party Presidential Debate, Day 1, Detroit, USA \u2013 30 Jul 2019This past week, six 2020 Democratic presidential candidates \u2014\u00a0Sen.
