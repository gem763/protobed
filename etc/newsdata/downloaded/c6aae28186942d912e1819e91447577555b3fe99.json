He then accused Vindman of being a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d, or a dyed-in-the-wool Trump critic, but the claim was quickly debunked in multiple reports.\n\nThat did not stop Trump\u2019s defenders in the media from attacking Vindman as disloyal.\n\n\u201cHere we have a US national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d said Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\nHer guest, John Yoo, a former George W Bush administration lawyer infamous for drafting a framework for torture, agreed. \u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d Yoo said.\n\nBut the backlash in the Republican ranks, rare where Trump is involved, was unusually harsh.\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a Purple Heart. I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,\u201d John Thune, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, told Politico. \u201cYou can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t go after him personally. He\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\nCongresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former vice-presidentDick Cheney, and a member of the House Republican leadership, echoed Thune in a press conference.", "description": "Lt Col Vindman reportedly said omissions included references to Joe Biden and BurismaLt Col Alexander Vindman arrives for a closed-door deposition at the US Capitol in Washington DC on Tuesday.
