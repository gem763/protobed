According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time that two brothers have faced each other as batter and pitcher while one was making his debut.\n\nBrian's first pitch went wildly into the dirt, but he calmed down and worked his brother until the count was full, then struck him out with a gutsy slider that nipped the low part of the zone.\n\nBrian intimated that some brotherly knowledge went into his decision to throw an off-speed pitch on the full count.\n\n\"It was pretty cool to say my first strikeout was my brother,\" he said, according to The Athletic. \"I had a feeling that if I could land a slider, he might not be expecting it. If I threw a ball, it might look like I was afraid of him. But I landed it.\"\n\nBrian's feeling was correct.\n\n\"He made a good pitch,\" Colin said of his older brother. \"I was looking heater, figured he'd come after me.\"\n\nWhile a professional baseball player likely never truly enjoys striking out, the smile on Colin's face indicated he didn't seem to mind that his brother had bested him on this occasion.\n\nColin Moran couldn't help but smile. @FoxSportsFL / Twitter\n\nAfter the at-bat, Colin joked with the home-plate umpire, Angel Hernandez.\n\n\"I said, 'Give me the ball. Maybe I could hold it for ransom or something,'\" Colin said, per The Athletic. \"I was messing around. I'm pretty sure it will be on his mantle every time I walk into Brian's house.\"\n\nThanks to a big inning at the plate from the Marlins, Brian would leave the night with the first win of his major-league career as well.\n\nHis stint in the majors might not last long \u2014 this is the final year that major-league rosters will expand to 40 players for September, a rule that in many cases allows for stories such as Moran's to unfold.\n\nBut regardless of what happens next, Moran's night on Thursday was one to remember \u2014 and one he can hold over his little brother for the rest of his life.", "description": "Brian Moran got a storybook moment in his baseball career on Thursday night, striking out his brother in his first major-league appearance.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d727be42e22af47df1fa3b8-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
