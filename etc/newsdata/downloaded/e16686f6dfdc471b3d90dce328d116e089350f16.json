We ran seminars for workers and spouses on topics like retirement income, insurance, lifestyle, relocation and more. I think it\u2019s fair to say that, if someone took advantage of the programs offered, they would have been well prepared financially and emotionally for retirement.\n\nSadly, relatively few workers utilized all that was available to them\u2014this despite the support and urging of the unions that represented them. I retired in 2010, suffering in part from banging-your-head-against-the-wall syndrome.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve learned a great deal more about retirement, both from my own experience and from others. Here are my top 10 lessons:\n\n1. No matter how well you\u2019ve prepared and how generous your sources of retirement income, money is always on your mind. For some reason, I\u2019ve found the financial \u201cwhat ifs\u201d still stare us in the face. Perhaps it\u2019s because we know there are no do-overs and hence our financial resources are finite.\n\nRead: The first year of early retirement has been one of the hardest of my life\n\n2. I am convinced that, once retired, the ability to rebuild savings remains essential. You cannot handle a significant, unexpected expense from your main retirement savings without jeopardizing your financial future. That means you need emergency money, outside of your regular retirement plan, and you need to replenish that fund if it\u2019s used.\n\n3. In the old days, we used to tell employees about the three-legged stool of retirement income: company pension, Social Security and personal savings. Today, the stool has different legs. For most Americans in the private sector, there\u2019s no company pension and instead only a 401(k) plan. The new legs are now employer plan savings, Social Security and other savings. Since retiring, I better appreciate the value of having substantial savings, beyond what you accumulate in your employer\u2019s plan.\n\n4. Maintaining your lifestyle isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. After nine years, I\u2019ve maintained mine. But that\u2019s only been possible because of a measure of frugality, coupled with my goal of retiring with enough income to replicate 100% of my base salary, rather than the standard advice to aim for 80%.\n\n5. Inflation is real. For many people, health care spending, property taxes and rent will be the big inflation concerns. There\u2019s no escaping inflation, so you need to plan. I would suggest having a pool of money that you leave untouched and allow to grow, until you need it later in retirement to offset increasing expenses.\n\n6. The transition to retirement isn\u2019t easy. I found it very hard to let go of my professional life. For instance, I used to be invited to speak at conferences around the country, staying in top resorts. In a blink of an eye, that was gone.\n\n7. Busy or bored? It\u2019s your choice. When I asked folks\u2014who were about to retire\u2014what they planned to do, typical answers included \u201cplay golf,\u201d \u201cfish\u201d and \u201ctinker around the house.\u201d Those aren\u2019t enough. But take heart: You\u2019ll soon be busy. The question is, will you be busy doing what you want to do?\n\n8. Where did all the \u201cfriends\u201d go? When you work with people for many years, your relationship with them might seem like it\u2019s about more than just business. But when you retire, and you lose your authority and influence, it can feel like you dropped off the planet. Your true friends will remain. But your value to others will be gone\u2014and so will they. Don\u2019t be surprised.\n\n9. There is an old saying, \u201cI married you for better or worse, but not for lunch.\u201d When I announced I was planning to retire, my wife said, \u201cFine, but I\u2019m not changing my activities.\u201d She hasn\u2019t and nor should she. When you add eight to 12 hours a day to the time you spend with a person, there\u2019s an adjustment. Talk about it.\n\n10. There is an end to retirement. I don\u2019t want to be maudlin. But before graduating school or college, we look forward to a career. During our career, we look forward to retirement. Once retired, we look forward to waking up.\n\nOK, it isn\u2019t that bad and it isn\u2019t like the end of the movie is a big secret. Still, when you receive notices of former co-workers passing, it\u2019s a little depressing. Keep calm and carry on.\n\nRichard Quinn blogs at QuinnsCommentary.com.
