The extra administrative work for your accountant of sorting out excess amounts should ease, but you may need help to make the application to use this new rule.\n\nBy way of background for other readers, all of us now have an annual limit of $25,000 we can receive in \u201cconcessional\u201d tax-deductible contributions. Such contributions are taxed at 15 per cent in a super fund, although this tax can be offset by tax credits such as dividend imputation entitlements.\n\nIncluded in this limit is the mandatory or compulsory 9.5 per cent of salary in SG payments that employers must contribute.\n\nBut there is an interesting quirk in the SG contribution rules that higher income contributors should be aware of. This arises from the way maximum SG contributions are required to be calculated by employers under the super rules.\n\nMaximum contribution base\n\nWhen determining how much SG an employer must pay, the current rules state there is a maximum level of SG that employers are liable for and it must be calculated on an employee\u2019s quarterly taxable earnings to a maximum $55,270 \u2013 known as the maximum contribution base \u2013 with 9.5 per cent of this amounting to $5250.65 a quarter.\n\nThis equates to annual SG of about $21,003 and while suspiciously close to the annual contribution limit, that\u2019s not by design.\n\nWhy the maximum SG employer calculation might be less than $25,000, says Cole, is because of the way employer contributions were originally required to be calculated in 1992-93 when the contribution base was introduced at $80,000 a year, or $20,000 a quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder this, the maximum contribution base was legislated to help employers avoid having to pay what were viewed as overly generous super contributions.\n\nEach year since then, it has been indexed according to a special formula.\n\nBut for higher earners, this might result in a total SG of $21,003 being contributed on their behalf this year even if their earnings are greater than $55,270 a quarter. This could be $4000 less than the SG to which they're entitled.\n\nCole says that while this is the current arrangement. there is a new formula included in the SG legislation in 2017-18 that could be introduced that reflects the true percentage of SG payable as well as the latest contributions cap.\n\nImplications\n\nThe current system has worked well for individuals with one employer. But if you have more than one employer paying you SG on a high salary, you can quickly breach the annual contribution limit. As SG is scheduled to increase, it makes it important for high income earners and those with multiple employers to understand the implications.\n\nRegarding the new laws that permit you to opt out of SG payments because they will exceed the $25,000 limit, Cole says this applies only if you have more than one employer and your quarterly income exceeds $55,270, The opt-out rules allow you to apply to the Australian Taxation Office for a certificate that will allow some of your employers to skip paying the SG for that quarter without incurring penalties.\n\nOne important consideration when applying for the SG exemption is what happens to the income that isn\u2019t contributed to super. While the preferred approach is to have this paid as extra salary, if this can\u2019t be negotiated it opens up a new chapter in salary negotiation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA summary of the new SG contribution rules on the Heffron SMSF Solutions blog states that if a certificate is issued, the employer won't have to make a contribution on your behalf. That gives them protection from breaching the SG rules.\n\nImportantly, says Heffron, the certificate process is silent on whether the individual and their employer have negotiated some form of alternative compensation for the loss of the super contributions. This is left to the two parties to resolve and may sometimes mean it is better not to use the exemption.\n\nFor example, if you are unable to reach an agreement with your employer to provide additional wages in lieu of compulsory contributions, you may choose not to apply for the notice. Without it, the employer is still legally obliged to provide the normal compulsory contributions.\n\nAs a final consideration, the first time these employer exemption certificates can be applied is for the quarter starting on January 1, 2020.\n\nTo achieve this, the ATO will need a completed form by November 18. You\u2019ll also need to talk to your employers to see if their super contribution systems will allow this to occur.\n\nFurther, you will need to be aware they don\u2019t have to comply with your request.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, says Cole, is that at least one of your jobs must still pay the SG, and that an exemption certificate may be issued for multiple quarters within a financial year but cannot cover more than one financial year. There is a lot to the new rules to be aware of.\n\nEmail journalist John Wasiliev with your questions at superquestions@afr.com.", "description": "A new rule can help you avoid penalty tax but there may be a compensation issue, writes John Wasiliev who answers your questions on super.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3566%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_158%2C$y_27/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/95f80160d32f6306b740115f9f16fff0cc601599", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
