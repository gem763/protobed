Another 16-year-old had a Sig Sauer P238 handgun tucked into his waistband.\n\nInvestigators say the video showed the three boys clutching two handguns and then racking the slides inside a Wesley Chapel branch of the store (above), prompting an emergency response from the Pasco County Sherriff's Office who were forwarded the clip\n\nThe first teen reportedly try to tell officers he got the gun from a 'friend', admitting he thought about throwing the gun away and running from law enforcement as they approached.\n\nHe has prior convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer, grand theft, and grand theft motor vehicle, and was arrested Tuesday for carrying a concealed firearm and delinquent in possession of a fire arm.\n\nThe second of the two 16-year-olds is accused of stealing his handgun after breaking into an unlocked vehicle in Saddlebrook and taking it from the glove box.\n\nThe boy was also found in possession of two stolen credit cards, a passport, driver's licence and other items linking back to the auto robbery, police said.\n\nHe was arrested on two counts of auto burglary, theft of a firearm, theft of a credit card, delinquent in possession of a firearm, and carrying a concealed firearm.\n\nThe third boy, aged 15, who initially refused to give officers his name, had a black backpack with a single round of ammunition inside it.\n\nHe had a prior conviction for an aggravated assault charge with a firearm and was charged with delinquent in possession of ammunition as well as resisting an officer and obstructing without violence.\n\nOne boy, 16, had a loaded Sig Sauer P228 handgun (shown in file photo above) hidden in his shorts, a police report released Wednesday alleges.

They were taken to the county jail in Land O'Lakes.\n\nTheir stunt came just over a month after Publix banned customers from openly carrying firearms in their stores, joining the likes of Walmart and Target in doing so.\n\nThe move came in response to a spate of mass shootings, including the El Paso Walmart shooting and the Dayton Ohio shooting which killed 31 and injured dozens more.\n\n'Publix respectfully requests that only law enforcement officials openly carry firearms in our stores,' the Florida-based grocery chain said in a statement in September.", "description": "Investigators say the boys filmed themselves clutching two handguns and then racking the slides inside a Wesley Chapel branch of the store.
