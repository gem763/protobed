The firm produced six investigative reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThobani Mnyandu, an expert at MNS Attorneys in construction law and tenders, was testifying on Thursday about the group's probe of R1.25 billion in relocation costs billed to Transnet after the site for the assembly of locomotives was changed from Pretoria to Durban.\n\nThe locomotives were part of a controversial contract for 1 064 new engines meant to upgrade and modernise Transnet's fleet. But the tender has been dogged by allegations of kickbacks, fraud and irregularities after prices increased from R38.9bn to R56bn.\n\nMnyandu said that, in initial talks between locomotive manufacturers China North Rail, Bombardier Transportation and Transnet, the location for the assembly of the locomotives was Koedoespoort in Pretoria. This was then changed to Durban.\n\nThe inquiry already heard last week from a minority shareholder in the China North Rail consortium that the cost for the relocation was \"simply unjustifiable\".\n\nOn Thursday, Mnyandu said \"there was no relocation\" in the strict sense of the word as the two locomotive manufacturer had not yet established themselves in Johannesburg.\n\nBased on internal emails that MNS had access to as part of its probe, Mnyandu said the change in the assembly point was even initially expected to produce savings on some items, so as to be closer to the harbour where the locomotive parts would be shipped to SA from abroad.\n\nThe initial cost of the CNR relocation was estimated at R9.7 million, he said. This amount was later raised to R318 million and then again to over R647 million.\n\nMnyandu said, based on emails, Transnet staff did not appear to try and negotiate these costs down. He will continue his testimony on Friday, including his findings.", "description": "Negotiators at Transnet appear to have done little to try and reduce ballooning costs for the relocation of assembly points for locomotives.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5145/276a9e94e9f64a039d310199065ccadb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
