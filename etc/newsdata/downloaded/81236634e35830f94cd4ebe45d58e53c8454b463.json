Make the sponge for the bottom tier by mixing all the dry ingredients together in a big bowl and whisk all the wet ingredients together in another. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and whisk until smooth and just combined.\n\nPour equal amounts of mixture into the three larger tins and bake for 15-20 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the centres comes out clean. Turn out the sponges onto a wire rack, peel off the baking paper and leave to cool.\n\nKim-Joy\u2019s vegan celebration cake from Series 9 requires skill, but is sure to impress\n\nMix together the sponge ingredients for the smaller, top-tier cakes, as before, and bake for 15-20 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centres comes out clean. Cool.\n\nFor the lemon curd\n\nMeanwhile, make the lemon curd. Whisk together the cornflour and 100ml water to a paste. Place in a small pan and stir in the sugar and lemon juice.\n\nCook on a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Keep stirring until the mixture has thickened and you can no longer taste the cornflour.\n\nTurn the heat to low and add the soya milk and oil.\n\nStir briskly until the oil has melted and the mixture is smooth, then pour into the shallow metal tray, cover with cling film and freeze for about 45 minutes.\n\nFor the biscuits\n\nPut all the dry ingredients and vanilla in a bowl, then rub in the coconut oil. Add 20-25ml of water and combine to make a dough.\n\nRoll out the dough on a floured worktop to about 6mm thick. Cut out three mushroom shapes and three fox shapes.\n\nPlace on the lined baking tray and bake for 8-10 minutes, until slightly browned at the edges. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nFor the royal icing\n\nMeanwhile, beat 75ml of the aquafaba in a stand mixer fitted with a beater, on medium-high speed until frothy, then add half the icing sugar and mix until smooth.\n\nAdd the remaining icing sugar and mix until the icing leaves a ribbon trail when you lift the beater. Add more icing sugar if too runny.\n\nPut about two-thirds of the royal icing in a medium bowl, then divide into three portions \u2014 one slightly larger than the other two.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have time for the whole creation, try making just the biscuits to enjoy with a cup of tea. Decorate the cake with the fox and mushroom biscuits\n\nColour the larger portion with orange colouring and a tiny amount of the honey-gold to make orange with a tinge of golden brown. Add the brown colouring and cocoa powder to one smaller portion for a deep brown colour.\n\nLeave the remaining portion white. Divide the icing colours into the small piping bags as follows, and set aside:\n\nOrange: 1/4 into 1 piping bag and 3/4 into another.\n\nBrown: Place all in 1 piping bag.\n\nWhite: 1/4 into 1 piping bag and 3/4 into another.\n\nAdd enough orange colouring to give a bright orange colour to the remaining icing in the mixer bowl, and stir in 1 tablespoon of aquafaba at a time, until the icing is runny enough for a controlled \u2018drip\u2019. Cover with cling film and set aside.\n\nFor the buttercream\n\nPut the spread into the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater and mix on a low-medium speed until smooth. Mix in the vegetable shortening until smooth and combined.\n\nMix in one-third of the icing sugar until combined, then add the remaining icing sugar, gradually increasing the speed each time, until the buttercream is white and smooth.\n\nPut half the buttercream into the large disposable piping bag.\n\nHow to melt chocolate Break the chocolate into small, even-sized pieces and place these in a heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a pan that is one-third full of gently simmering or steaming water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Turn the heat to low, or turn it off completely, and just let the chocolate melt, occasionally giving it a stir to help it, if you like. When the chocolate is melted, carefully lift the bowl off the pan. Set the bowl over a pan that is one-third full of gently simmering or steaming water\n\nDivide and colour the remainder as follows, and set aside: About 150g buttercream coloured pink.\n\nAbout 150g buttercream coloured dark green. About 2 tablespoons of buttercream coloured light green. Leave the remainder in the bowl.\n\nTo assemble the base\n\nPlace the larger cake board on the icing turntable. Snip a large tip on the piping bag containing white buttercream and pipe a blob on the board. Top with a large sponge.\n\nSpread a little buttercream from the bowl over the surface of the cake and, from the piping bag, pipe a white buttercream \u2018dam\u2019 around the top edge of the cake (this is to stop the lemon curd seeping out).\n\nSpoon 2-3 tablespoons of the lemon curd on top and spread evenly. Repeat with a second large sponge and then top with the third large sponge.\n\nSpread the white buttercream from the bowl on top of the cake and around the sides. Spread a few smears of pink buttercream here and there on the sides.\n\nSmooth the top, then smooth the sides using the icing scraper. Aim for a thin crumb coat (see right). Insert dowels into the cake and transfer to the fridge to keep chilled.\n\nTo assemble the top tier\n\nHow to temper chocolate Tempering chocolate is a process of heating and cooling chocolate to a particular temperature to produce chocolate that is shiny and has a good snap. Firstly, follow the process for melting chocolate (above). Melt two-thirds of the chocolate until a sugar thermometer shows 45c/113f for dark chocolate or 43c/109f for milk or white. Remove from the heat, then stir in the remaining third of chocolate until melted. Leave to cool, continuing to stir, until the temperature reaches 27c/80f. Tempering chocolate is a process of heating and cooling chocolate to a particular temperature to produce chocolate that is shiny and has a good snap\n\nPlace the smaller cake board onto the turntable and stack and ice the smaller sponge layers just as you did for the base tier, except this time using dark green icing on the top and a combination of white and dark green buttercream on the sides.\n\nMark the outline of a fox shape on the top of the uppermost cake using the cocktail stick.\n\nSnip a very small hole in the piping bag containing the smaller amount of orange royal icing, and snip a small-medium tip on the bag containing the larger amount of orange royal icing.\n\nRepeat for the white royal icing. Snip a small tip on the brown royal icing.\n\nUse the small-tipped piping bags of orange and white royal icing to pipe the outline of the fox. Use the larger tipped bags to \u2018flood\u2019 the orange and white areas.\n\nWorking quickly, use the cocktail stick to blend the white and orange by the tip of the tail. Leave to set, then add the legs, nose and mouth.\n\nNow start piping the biscuits, piping the foxes in the same way you did for the cake. Pipe orange over the mushroom biscuits (outline first, then flooding), and pipe on white dots while the orange icing is wet.\n\nRemove the first cake tier from the fridge and place the second tier on top. Using a large spoon, pour the thinned orange icing in carefully controlled drips down the side of the bottom cake tier.\n\nFor the roses and swirls\n\nMarble the pink buttercream with a little of the remaining white buttercream, but don\u2019t over mix, then divide it in half and place each half in a large piping bag \u2014 one fitted with the closed-star nozzle and the other with the petal nozzle.\n\nPipe swirls around the base of each tier and pipe roses on top.\n\nColour any remaining white buttercream with lime green, place this in the remaining small piping bag. Snip the end into a V-shape and pipe tiny green leaves between the roses.\n\nDecorate the cake with the fox and mushroom biscuits.\n\nPineapple and coconut sandwich cake\n\nIn Series 8, Sophie made this tropical-tasting sandwich cake, topped with a pineapple flower made of baked pineapple \u2018leather\u2019.\n\nHands-on: 1\u00bd hours\n\nBake: 1\u00bd hours\n\nServes 12\n\nYou will need:\n\n20cm sandwich tins x 2, greased, then base-lined with baking paper\n\nBaking sheet lined with baking paper\n\nMini-muffin tray\n\nSugar thermometer\n\n1 large piping bag fitted with a medium, plain nozzle.\n\nFor the sponge\n\n1 pineapple, peeled, cut into 3 x 5mm-thick rounds, then the remainder cored and cut into small chunks\n\n170g unsalted butter, softened\n\n225g caster sugar\n\n5 large eggs, beaten\n\n240g self-raising flour, sifted\n\n100g fresh coconut chunks, peeled and blitzed to a gravel texture\n\n15g coconut flakes, toasted, to decorate\n\nFor the buttercream\n\n300g caster sugar\n\n3 egg whites\n\n250g unsalted butter, diced and softened\n\n\u00bd tsp coconut flavouring, plus extra to taste, if necessary\n\nPlace the pineapple flower in the centre of the cake and decorate with toasted coconut flakes and the reserved 50g of pineapple, chopped into 1cm pieces\n\nHeat the oven to 180c/fan 160c/350f/gas 4. Weigh out 150g of the pineapple chunks for the cake mixture, drain thoroughly and pat dry with kitchen paper. Set aside 50g for decoration (eat the rest).\n\nCombine the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a beater attachment, on medium speed for 3-5 minutes, until pale and creamy. Gradually add the eggs, little by little, beating well after each addition.\n\nAdd 1 tablespoon of the flour with the last three additions of egg, then sift in the remaining flour and fold to combine. Mix in the coconut \u2018gravel\u2019 and pineapple chunks.\n\nDivide the mixture equally between the prepared tins. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centres comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 2 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Reduce the oven to 140c/fan 120c/275f/gas 1.\n\nPrepare the pineapple flower. Put the 3 pineapple slices on the lined baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, then turn over and bake for a further 15-20 minutes, until they are dry but flexible, with golden edges.\n\nIn Series 8, Sophie made this tropical-tasting sandwich cake, topped with a pineapple flower made of baked pineapple \u2018leather\u2019\n\nPress each slice into a hole in the muffin tray. Return to the oven for a further 20 minutes or so, until dry and golden. Cool in the tray, then stack the slices into each other to make a flower. Set aside.\n\nNow make the buttercream by dissolving the sugar in 90ml of water in a medium pan over a low heat (about 3-5 minutes). While the sugar is dissolving, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.\n\nOnce the sugar has completely dissolved, increase the heat under the pan to a rapid boil until the syrup reaches 121c/250f on a sugar thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat.\n\nWith the whisk at full speed, pour the hot syrup onto the egg whites in a thin stream. Continue whisking until the meringue is very thick and glossy and has cooled to room temperature.\n\nGradually add the butter, whisking after each addition until the buttercream is smooth and thick. Incorporate the coconut flavouring, adding more to taste, if you prefer. Cover the bowl and chill until firm enough to pipe.\n\nTo assemble, place one sponge, top-side down, on a cake stand. Spoon the buttercream into the large piping bag fitted with the plain nozzle.\n\nPipe large \u2018kisses\u2019 on top of the sponge, saving half the buttercream for the next layer. Top with the second sponge, top-side upwards, and pipe more kisses.\n\nPlace the pineapple flower in the centre of the cake and decorate with toasted coconut flakes and the reserved 50g of pineapple, chopped into 1cm pieces.\n\nHow to ice a semi-naked cake\n\nNaked cakes are bare or un-iced on the side, while semi-naked cakes have a very thin covering of buttercream icing that allows the cake layers to peak through.\n\nUse the following instructions for creating semi-naked cakes or for crumb-coating cakes you will later decorate fully.\n\nYou will need: Cake-decorating turntable or cake stand or board l Palette knife l Tall side scraper.\n\n1. Assemble your layer cake as instructed in the recipe, spreading a generous layer of your chosen buttercream between the layers of cake and making sure the sponges are even and flat.\n\nFill and smooth any gaps at the side of the cake, between the layers. Once you have a smooth surface, you\u2019re ready for the semi-naked coating.\n\nAssemble your layer cake as instructed in the recipe, spreading a generous layer of your chosen buttercream between the layers of cake and making sure the sponges are even and flat\n\n2. Generously spread some additional buttercream around the sides of the cake with a palette knife using gentle pressure and with one hand on top of the cake to secure it.\n\nOccasionally, revolve the turntable or cake plate or board while you work around the cake, to make sure it is evenly coated.\n\nGenerously spread some additional buttercream around the sides of the cake with a palette knife\n\nOnce you have covered the side in a single coating of buttercream, spread an even layer over the top of the cake\n\n3. Once you have covered the side in a single coating of buttercream, spread an even layer over the top of the cake, spreading it out smoothly with the palette knife.\n\n4. Once the whole cake is covered, use a side scraper to smooth off any excess covering on the sides.\n\nSpread and remove the buttercream until you are happy with the finish and coverage \u2013 expose some areas of the cake and leave others more covered.\n\n5. Put the cake in the fridge to chill and firm up for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. If chilling for more than 2 hours, cover loosely with cling film after the first hour.\n\nOnce the whole cake is covered, use a side scraper to smooth off any excess covering on the sides. Spread and remove the buttercream until you are happy with the finish and coverage\n\nGrandma's fruit cake\n\nThis is a recipe passed down from Steph\u2019s great-grandmother via her mum. A rich Christmas cake, soaked in brandy, it is best baked at least five weeks before eating. These quantities will also make a single 30cm cake, baked for 4-4\u00bd hours.\n\nHands-on: 20 mins\n\nBake: 4 hours\n\nServes 60\n\nYou will need:\n\n23cm and 15cm round, deep cake tins, greased then double lined (base and sides) with baking paper, then double wrapped in strips of brown paper around the outsides of the tins (tie with string)\n\nSpoon 2 tablespoons of extra brandy into each cake, then cover the cakes with baking paper and wrap them in foil. Place them in a tin or box, to store\n\nFor the fruit cake\n\n475g salted butter, softened\u25cf 475g dark muscovado sugar\n\n8 eggs, beaten\n\n475g self-raising flour, sifted\n\n1\u00bd tsp mixed spice\n\n\u00bc tsp nutmeg\n\nPinch of salt\n\n500g raisins\n\n500g currants\n\n500g sultanas\n\n75g each of green and red glac\u00e9 cherries, quartered\n\n125g candied peel, chopped\n\n50g angelica, chopped\n\nFinely grated zest of1\u00bd unwaxed lemons\n\n2 tbsp brandy, plus extra for feeding the cake\n\nFor the almond paste\n\n800g ground almonds\n\n400g caster sugar\n\n400g icing sugar, sifted\n\n2 tbsp vanilla essence\n\nJuice of 2 lemons\n\n3 eggs, beaten\n\n6 tbsp apricot jam\n\nFor the royal icing\n\n4 egg whites\n\n1kg icing sugar, sifted\n\n4 tsp lemon juice\n\n2 tsp glycerine\n\nHeat the oven to 150c/fan 130c/300f/gas 2. Beat the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment, on medium speed for 5 minutes, until pale and creamy.\n\nWith the mixer on a low speed, add the eggs, a little at a time, beating well between each addition.\n\nPlace the flour, spices, salt, raisins, currants, sultanas, glace cherries, candied peel, angelica and lemon zest into a very large mixing bowl and stir together.\n\nAdd the 2 tablespoons of brandy, then add the creamed mixture to the fruit and stir well with a large metal spoon until everything is evenly combined.\n\nThis is a recipe passed down from Steph\u2019s great-grandmother via her mum. Her cake featured in series 10\n\nDivide the mixture proportionately between the two tins. Level the tops, then bake: the 23cm cake will take 3\u00bd-4 hours and the 15cm will take about 2\u00bd hours \u2014 or until the cakes feel firm to the touch, are a rich, golden brown, and a skewer inserted into centres comes out clean.\n\nIf they are colouring too much, cover them with foil for the remaining baking time.\n\nOnce the cakes are baked, leave them to cool completely in the tins, then transfer to a plate or board, leaving the baking paper attached to the sides and bottom to keep them moist.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if there\u2019s a little dip in the top of each cake. Use a skewer to pierce the cakes all over, taking care not to pierce all the way to the bottom.\n\nSpoon 2 tablespoons of extra brandy into each cake, then cover the cakes with baking paper and wrap them in foil. Place them in a tin or box, to store.\n\nUncover the cakes once a week for the next 4 weeks, each time feeding with 1 tablespoon of brandy each.\n\nAbout 1 week before you intend to serve the cakes, make the almond paste. In a bowl, using a wooden spoon, mix together the almonds, caster sugar and icing sugar.\n\nA rich Christmas cake, soaked in brandy, it is best baked at least five weeks before eating. These quantities will also make a single 30cm cake, baked for 4-4\u00bd hours\n\nAdd the vanilla, lemon juice and enough of the beaten eggs to give a stiff paste (you may not need all the egg). Chill the paste for 30 minutes to firm up.\n\nFor the 15cm cake, you will need about 550g paste; for the 23cm cake about 950g.\n\nOn a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll out one half of each weighed portion of almond paste to a circle large enough to cover the top of each cake and about 1-1.5cm thick.\n\nWith the remaining paste, roll out two long strips, one each to cover the sides of the cakes.\n\nHeat the apricot jam in a small pan over a low heat to loosen. Brush the top and side of each cake with the warm jam, then place the appropriate circle of almond paste on top and wrap the appropriate strip around the side, trimming any excess and pressing the seam together where the pieces of paste meet.\n\nLoosely cover the cakes with baking paper and leave for at least 24 hours before spreading over the royal icing.\n\nTo make the royal icing, whisk the egg whites with an electric hand whisk for about 1-2 minutes, until frothy.\n\nWhisk in the icing sugar and stir in the lemon juice and glycerine. Whisk together until the icing is thick enough to hold stiff peaks.\n\nUsing a palette knife, spread the tops and sides of the cakes with royal icing.\n\nSmooth it around the sides and rough up the tops to create the effect of snow.\n\nTip: Leave the cakes overnight at room temperature to allow the icing to harden, then store in a tin until needed.
