According to ESPN sources, Hill suffered a posterior SC joint (where the collarbone meets the sternum) dislocation and will \u201cmiss a few weeks.\u201d\n\nChiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder explained why a visit to the hospital was needed for Hill.\n\n\u201cThose can be injured coming out the front, up top or in the back,\u201d Burkholder said. \u201cIf it goes posteriorly or back it becomes a medical issue for us so that we worry that there\u2019s more problems. His came back posteriorly and he didn\u2019t have any medical issues, but we still transported him to Baptist Medical Center and we turned his care over to Brett Frykberg, who is an ortho-trauma physician.\u201d\n\nHill, who has 25 touchdown catches in three seasons in the NFL, is an explosive playmaker and will be sorely missed for the Chiefs. Luckily for Kansas City, they also have Sammy Watkins on their roster, and he stepped up in Hill\u2019s absence on Sunday to the tune of a career-high 198 receiving yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe question is, can Watkins, who has never played a full season outside of his rookie year and missed six games last season due to injury, continue to fill Hill\u2019s cleats going forward?\n\nLas Vegas seems to think he at least has a shot to do so, as the Chiefs are 9.5-point favorites over the Raiders next week despite the game being in Oakland. The Chiefs are also one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl at +500, trailing only the Patriots (+280). The Eagles (+1000), Rams (+1200+ and Saints (+1200) have the next-best odds to win it all.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
