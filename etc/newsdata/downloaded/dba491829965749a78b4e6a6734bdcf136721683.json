Both touchdowns, as part of seven passes for 130 yards, went to Minnesota wide receiver Adam Thielen, to whom Cousins apologized earlier in the week for a lack of involvement in the offense.\n\nAD\n\nCousins\u2019s performance Sunday was anything but sorry, which might have quelled the ire of Minnesota fans, at least for the time being. Signed as a 2018 free agent to an unprecedented contract \u2014 a fully guaranteed $84 million over three years \u2014 the eighth-year veteran has been viewed by many as a disappointment, getting off to a low-wattage start this year after failing to lead a highly touted Vikings squad to the playoffs last season.\n\nAD\n\nCousins has previous ties to Trump: In 2017, he had an opportunity to play a round of golf with him.\n\n\u201cGreat experience,\u201d Cousins, then the Redskins\u2019 starting quarterback, said at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever think that would happen.\"\n\nKirk Cousins played golf w/ President Trump this past weekend.

I thought somebody was pranking me,\u201d Cousins said of the outing to Sports Illustrated later in the year. \u201c\u2026 Look, if it had been any president \u2014 far left, far right, middle \u2014 I was gonna go. That\u2019s the President of the United States. If any other former president would love to play golf, I\u2019m open to it. Let me know.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was \u2014 how do you say it? \u2014 just a normal guy,\u201d the quarterback continued. \u201cHe was pretty easy to talk to. He was friendly and, frankly, he asked a lot of questions, about the Redskins and my situation. How long have you been there? How long are you under contract?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs it turned out, Cousins would not be under contract with the Redskins for much longer. But while his move to Minnesota involved huge money, his passing statistics this season had not been quite as eye-popping.\n\nThat changed Sunday, and apparently, Trump took note.\n\nRead more:\n\nAnother Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nMason Rudolph back at Steelers\u2019 facility after being knocked out by scary hit\n\nNBA under fire from all directions after response to Rockets-China incident\n\nAD", "description": "The call came just ahead of a Trump rally in Minneapolis, though the Minnesota quarterback, who played golf with the president in 2017, was reported to not be planning on attending.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mlE6fbfvKFw-rdJaTMBQnWZ9f50=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QBAJP4HIPEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
