Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nChina's communist government didn't like that very much, however, and has since pulled Rockets' merchandise off its shelves and some NBA games off of state TV. Morey's tweet also prompted many Chinese corporations to end their sponsorships with the league.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NBA, instead of standing up for free speech, initially called Morey's comment \u201cregrettable\u201d in an effort to contain the economic damage.\n\nCue Barkley who spoke out during an NBA pregame show on TNT, a time when many fans were likely watching to escape the non-stop drumbeat of politics that dominates our news cycle.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up,\u201d Barkley said \u201cAll American companies are doing business in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why these holier than thou politicians \u2014 if they\u2019re so worried about China, then why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China?\u201d Sir Charles added.\n\nBarkley was responding to Pence's tough comments on Thursday, when the former Indiana governor said it is \"un-American\u201d for American companies to \u201cembrace censorship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\" Pence said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBarkley is telling the vice president to do the political version of \u201cshut up and dribble.\u201d It's never a good look when a prominent American sides with a communist country over the U.S. But that's the team Barkley plays on now, to the point he might have to change his name to Comrade Charles.\n\nKnow this: Barkley has made himself into a huge star in his post-basketball career doing exactly what Mike Pence did yesterday \u2014 exercising his right to free speech.\n\nBut now Charles wants Pence and presumably all Americans to keep their collective mouths shut when it comes to criticizing China, the NBA and specifically the way the league has handled this entire sordid situation in an effort to protect its billion-plus-dollar investment in the country.\n\nOf course the 11-time all-star and the league had no problem injecting themselves into a dicey situation regarding the North Carolina bathroom bill controversy in 2016. The law mandated that people use restrooms based on their legal gender on their birth certificate.\n\nThe NBA quickly took a side in the debate in an effort to show how woke it was and pulled its All-Star game out of Charlotte as a result, thereby punishing the state economically.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job, with the position of power that I\u2019m in and being able to be on television, I\u2019m supposed to stand up for the people who can\u2019t stand up for themselves,\u201d Barkley said in his opposition to the bathroom bill three years ago.\n\n\n\nIn a related story, an estimated one million Muslim Uighurs are detained in Chinese concentration camps, which likely don't have much in the way of acceptable bathroom facilities. Not a peep out of Barkley on standing up for people who can't stand up for themselves on that one.\n\n\n\nFact is, many in our media don't care about China either and that's shown through their bias of omission.\n\nCNN and the New York Times recently sponsored a three-hour-plus Democratic presidential debate that contained dozens of questions but not a single one on what is one of the most important foreign policy issues facing this country \u2014 China and its myriad attempts to silence American companies as outlined above.\n\nPerhaps neither outlet considered the topic sexy or sizzling enough when compared to hearing about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush, a topic which ate up nearly 20 minutes at the end of the debate.\n\n\u201cIf you are willing to abandon your principles for convenience, or social acceptability, they are not your principles, they are your costume,\u201d the old anonymous quote goes.\n\nCharles Barkley was a great basketball player. He's also a great commentator \u2014 just not a very principled one.\n\nJoe Concha is a media reporter for The Hill and co-host of \"WOR Tonight with Joe Concha\" weeknights on 710-WOR in New York.
