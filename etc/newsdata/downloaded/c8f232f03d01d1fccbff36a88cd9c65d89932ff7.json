The court uses this term because it is the term used by the Supreme Court in its latest pronouncement pertaining to this area of the law. See Arizona v. U.S., 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012).\n\nFederal immigration laws, such as 8 U.S.C. \u00a71365, which deals with a reimbursement program the federal government has for states that are incarcerating illegal aliens, uses the term \u201cillegal aliens\u201d in its title and within the statute itself. An illegal alien is defined as anyone \u201cwho is in the United States unlawfully.\u201d\n\nIn fact, last year, the Department of Justice reminded its attorneys to use proper legal language in their briefs, which means using the term \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d Among the problem phrases it told its lawyers to purge from their lexicon was the term \u201cundocumented immigrant.\u201d\n\nSo what is the city of New York going to do? Attempt to punish anyone who uses the correct legal terminology of federal law and court decisions?\n\nThis action by New York is so far outside the bounds of what it can legally do, and such a fundamental violation of the First Amendment and common sense, that it is hard to imagine it\u2019s anything other than a fictional plot in a book like \u201c1984.\u201d Unfortunately, it is not fiction.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission supposedly limits the reach of this ban by saying it is only a violation when the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d is used with the \u201cintent to demean, humiliate, or offend a person.\u201d\n\nBut this supposed limitation is not really a limitation since at the very same time, the commission says the very use of the word alien or alienage is \u201coffensive\u201d and may \u201ccarry negative connotations and dehumanize immigrants, marking them as \u2018other.\u2019\u201d\n\nDoes anyone really believe that there are any circumstances under which the Human Rights Commission would not find the use of the term \u201cillegal aliens\u201d to be demeaning, humiliating, or offensive?\n\nAnyone who believes that probably also believes that you can easily find affordable, up-scale housing in New York.\n\nThe commission has also made it illegal harassment to call federal immigration authorities about the \u201cactual\u201d immigration status of individuals. So if an employer finds out that an employee is in the country unlawfully by contacting the Feds, he may be found in violation of the city ordinance.\n\nMoreover, an illegal alien can file a complaint with the Human Rights Commission over violations. According to the guidance, remedies, including \u201ceconomic and emotional distress damages, are available under the [ordinance] regardless of an employee\u2019s immigration status.\u201d\n\nIn other words, an illegal alien can sue if his employer or his landlord uses the correct legal terminology in referring to his legal (sorry, illegal) status.\n\nNew York City makes it unlawful to refuse to provide housing to illegal aliens. It even has a provision on \u201cassociational discrimination\u201d that makes it illegal for a landlord to refuse to rent an apartment to a U.S. citizen that the landlord knows will have illegal aliens living in the apartment.\n\nSo if you are a human trafficker housing illegal aliens you\u2019ve smuggled across the border in an apartment you\u2019re renting, don\u2019t worry. If the landlord finds out about it he will be barred from doing anything about it.\n\nUnder federal law, any individual in this country who is not a citizen is an alien. And any alien who is here without permission is here illegally. This should be the end of the story. But it is not in New York.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia once said that \u201c[d]ay by day, case by case, the Supreme Court is busy designing a Constitution for a country I do not recognize.\u201d The city of New York\u2019s Commission on Human Rights is busy doing the same thing.", "description": "The propaganda, surveillance, and censorship of Big Brother in George Orwell\u2019s novel \u201c1984\u201d has now arrived in New York.\u00a0\n\nThe city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights recently released new legal enforcement\u00a0guidelines\u00a0that ban the use of the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d by employers, housing providers (including hotels), and law enforcement as \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d Violators can be punished with exorbitant and punitive fines\u2014up to $250,000 per offense.", "authors": ["Hans Von Spakovsky", "Commentary By", "Election Law Reform Initiative", "Senior Legal Fellow", "Fall Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-1148127304.jpg?itok=U5Kp-KwY", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
