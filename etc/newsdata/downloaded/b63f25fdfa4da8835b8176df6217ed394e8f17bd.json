Chris Connett, travelling foreman for Ispolini\u2019s handler Charlie Appleby, both insisted the horses were fit.\n\nMarmelo was runner-up to Cross Counter last year, while Ispolini was touted as his Godolphin stablemate\u2019s possible successor.\n\nThose hopes have been dashed after Racing Victoria stewards ruled neither horse would be allowed to start in Tuesday\u2019s $8 million Cup.\n\nIspolini has come under increasing scrutiny from RV vets and stewards after undergoing two separate scans at the weekend.\n\nStewards decided to order the horse\u2019s withdrawal after results of a standing CT scan indicated \u201cpre-fracture pathology\u201d in the stayer\u2019s right front cannon bone.\n\nMarmelo was referred to the University of Melbourne Equine Clinic to undergo a scan after showing signs upon soreness by RV vets.\n\nRV said the results of the scan indicated \u201can incomplete fracture of the near fore cannon bone and an incomplete fracture in its off hind cannon bone\u201d.\n\nStewards said the decision to withdraw both horses was made to \u201censure the safety and wellbeing\u201d of all horses and riders in the race.\n\nThe orders came as Saeed bin Suroor\u2019s veteran Red Galileo faces an uncertain future with a leg fracture sustained in trackwork on Wednesday.\n\nTwo other internationals \u2014 Red Verdon and Gold Mount \u2014 were last week ruled out through injury.\n\nDesperate to avoid another Cup fatality after those involving The Cliffsofmoher and Red Cadeaux in recent years, RV has been using a new scanning device which has detected injury issues in several internationals.\n\nAppleby\u2019s travelling foreman Chris Connett said on Tuesday that Ispolini had thrived in Australia, but no risks would be taken.\n\n\u201cRegards to Ispolini, when he arrived here RV vet Grace Forbes was not exactly happy with his action and invited us to go for a standing CT (scan),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose results have come back and the team back home are looking at those.\n\n\u201cWhen we get the results back from there the team back home and the vets here will have a discussion and decide what we want to do.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t missed a day of training while they have been here, their gallops have been good and at the moment we are full steam ahead.\u201d\n\nMarmelo was one of four Cup hopefuls inspected on Monday after showing signs of soreness.\n\nBowman was booked to ride Marmelo again this year after a fast-finishing second behind Cross Counter in last year\u2019s Cup.\n\nThe hoop sensationally weighed in one kilogram over the allotted 55kg after the race.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, I weighed in heavy last year so essentially he\u2019s going to have the same weight as last year and meets Cross Counter (57.5kg) a lot better,\u201d Bowman said.\n\n\u201cThe race sets up well for him \u2026 he\u2019ll make his presence felt.\u201d\n\nMORE NEWS\n\nMelbourne Cup: Everything you need to
