Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has faced mounting questions and critiques on how she would pay for Medicare for All, told a crowd at a town hall event in Iowa on Sunday those details are forthcoming.\n\nWarren has established herself as a fierce proponent of a single-payer health care system, but she has not gone as far as her ideological counterpart, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in admitting that the plan will result in taxes going up for middle class Americans.\n\nThe presidential hopeful told a crowd at a town hall event in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday that she will soon release an outline detailing the plan to fund the system, which by some estimates could cost over $60 trillion in the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and specifically how we pay for it,\u201d Warren told the crowd.\n\n\u201cI think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I\u2019ve been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,\u201d she told reporters:\n\nWarren adviser on Friday: \"[Warren\u2019s] taxes as they currently exist are NOT enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance.\u201d Warren today: \"I've been working for a long time on this question about what the cost will be and how to pay for it.\" pic.twitter.com/quq7e0GjVF \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) October 20, 2019\n\nModerators \u2013 in more than one Democrat debate \u2013 have asked Warren if she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for Medicare for All. Each time, the Massachusetts senator has offered notoriously evasive responses, talking about overall \u201ccost\u201d rather than directly explaining if taxes will go up for the middle class.\n\nModerators presented her with the same question during last week\u2019s Democrat debate, and Warren went to her go-to talking point, arguing that overcall costs will go up for the \u201cwealthy and big corporations\u201d and go down for middle-class families.\n\nThat answer sparked criticism from Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who slammed Warren for repeatedly dodging the question.\n\n\u201cWell, you heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\u201d he continued. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this.\u201d\n\nWarren would not budge in the spin room following the debate, telling the panel, \u201cMy commitment is I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families.\u201d\n\nSanders, on the other hand, has been very open about the cost of his plan. While he also believes that it is about overall \u201ccosts,\u201d \u2013 arguing that middle class Americans will ultimately save money due to health care costs supposedly going down \u2013 he admitted last month that health care is not free.\n\n\u201cNow having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,\u201d Sanders told late-night host Stephen Colbert last month. \u201cSo what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person\u2019s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbove that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if I say to you, that right now you\u2019re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That\u2019s gone.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
