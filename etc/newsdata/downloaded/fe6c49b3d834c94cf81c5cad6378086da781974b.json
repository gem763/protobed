In fact, this past weekend the central bank of Argentina restricted civilians to buying only $200 in USD per month, down from the previous $10,000.\n\n\u201cIn Argentina, if you receive a bank transference in USD they convert it immediately to ARS (Argentinian Nuevo peso), and you lose money,\u201d Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO\u2019s head of business development in Latin America, told CoinDesk. \u201cWe know BTC hodlers don\u2019t want to sell their BTC, but they need liquidity, for their daily expenses. That is why we think this is relevant for Latin America.\u201d\n\nLedn isn\u2019t the first company to notice that bitcoiners are eager for access to the ethereum community\u2019s experimental loan products. Silicon Valley startups in the Cross-Chain Working Group are also working on a different solution to allow wrapped bitcoin tokens directly on the ethereum blockchain.\n\nPlus, later this month Maker token holders, who govern the stablecoin ecosystem, will vote on whether to include bitcoin among the upcoming multi-collateral version of DAI. (Currently, DAI tokens are only made by locking up ether tokens in smart contracts that monitor ether prices and automatically liquidate the ether collateral if the price plummets.)\n\nIn the meantime, Ledn will buy ethereum-backed DAI from over-the-counter traders and manage bitcoin custody for loan clients. Di Bartolomeo said clients across Latin American have reported banking issues comparable to Argentina, although unique for each context, which is why they are turning to DAI. He added Colombians make up 16 percent of Ledn\u2019s user base, the largest demographic in Latin America, followed by Venezuelans at 12 percent.\n\n\u201cSeveral users have expressed that they would like to use stablecoins like DAI to purchase additional digital assets and others to access more financial services,\u201d he said.\n\nDeFi boom\n\nLedn users will soon be able to lock up their bitcoin and spend DAI at 750 merchants across Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, according to MakerDAO\u2019s Alvarez.\n\nSeparate from the loan startup, MakerDAO is partnering with product-provider Pundi X, and planning to install point-of-sale devices across Latin America so that DAI users can spend crypto directly on goods and services. In addition, brick-and-mortar locations will enable a user in Argentina to send fiat or DAI to Venezuela, for example, with Pundi X\u2019s debit card\u2013esque Xcard.\n\n\u201cThe [Ledn] DAI loan gives bitcoiners the opportunity to enter into the DeFi world, and all the projects inside the ecosystem,\u201d Alvarez said.\n\nDi Bartolomeo told CoinDesk he\u2019s excited to work with MakerDAO precisely because they have \u201cboots on the ground\u201d where his customer base lives. Dozens of people have attended DAI meetups in Mexico City, Bogota and Buenos Aires over the past year. Globally, MakerDAO records currently show more than 60,000 DAI wallet addresses in October 2019.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t yet explicitly hear from our users that they are spending DAI for their day-to-day expenses like they do with dollars,\u201d Di Bartolomeo said, \u201cwe expect stablecoin adoption to increase in the region because they solve important problems for users.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk contributor Diana Aguilar is Ledn\u2019s digital content director.
