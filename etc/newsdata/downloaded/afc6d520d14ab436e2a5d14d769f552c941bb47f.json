He said taking the role was perhaps in \u201cpoor judgement,\u201d but not improper. Nonetheless, President Trump has hammered Hunter Biden with corruption allegations and has even pressed Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family, a move that is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s sons Eric and Don Jr. say their success differs from Hunter\u2019s because they adjusted their business dealings \u2014 they\u2019re both executives for the Trump Organization \u2014 after their father was elected president in 2016. They also note that they were involved in overseas deals before their father became a politician. Trump Jr. acknowledged Wednesday that it\u2019d be \u201cfoolish\u201d to say \u201cI am not part of who I am because of my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference between us and Hunter is when my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business, right?\u201d Eric Trump said in an interview on Fox News Tuesday. \u201cWhen his father became vice president of the United States, he got into international business.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ve cut ties with foreign deals entirely, as they\u2019ve claimed, and they\u2019ve also been widely accused of profiting off their father\u2019s presidency. Hunter Biden, meanwhile, said he\u2019ll stop working with foreign companies if his dad ultimately becomes president. He stopped working with Burisma in April.\n\nCover: Donald Trump Jr. greets supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump before he speaks at a Make America Great Again rally on April 27, 2019 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
