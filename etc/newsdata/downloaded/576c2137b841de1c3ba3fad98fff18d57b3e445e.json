Love Island sparked concerns over the psychological strain put on contestants. Big Brother received complaints over bullying and racism. I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! has been accused of animal cruelty.\n\nBut back in the early noughties, there was one reality series that attracted almost universal backlash and was named Entertainment Weekly\u2019s worst reality series ever.\n\nThat show was The Swan \u2013 a reality show that somehow ran for two seasons in 2004. US network Fox premiered The Swan in April that year, with 16 women all hoping to make it to the grand pageant final. And how would they get there?\n\nBy undergoing a complete plastic surgery overhaul.\n\nAs explained in the show\u2019s voiceover: \u2018A group of ordinary women hand over their lives to a team of cosmetic and plastic surgeons. They will be put through a brutal three month makeover all for the chance to become beauty queens. Each week, two contestants will be transformed, but only will be judged beautiful enough to move on to the pageant.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresented by Irish host Amanda Byram, The Swan \u2013 so-called based on the fairytale The Ugly Duckling \u2013 chose a cast of women deemed to be unattractive and suffering from low self-esteem and gave them extreme makeovers, not just with a box of hair dye and a make-up artist, but with specially selected plastic surgeons.\n\nThe doctors included Dr Randal Haworth and Dr Terry Dubrow, who are both board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery \u2013 you\u2019ll recognise Dr Dubrow from going on to star on E!\u2019s Botched.\n\nHeartbreaking clips of each woman were shown on the show as they discussed their lack of self-worth and self-esteem, with season two contestant Marsha Meddleburg saying: \u2018I feel completely unbearably disgusted with myself. My biggest fear is being alone. I\u2019d give anything to not want to be invisible.\u2019 Season one\u2019s eventual winner Rachel Love-Frazier cried as she said: \u2018When you\u2019re a person who doesn\u2019t have a great deal of self-esteem, sometimes you feel like why do I bother.\u2019\n\nEach contestant was reviewed by the panel, including surgeons, a personal trainer, a cosmetic dentist and therapist Dr Lynn Ianni, who attempted to get to the bottom of what was going on inside. Critics of the show noted that Dr Ianni\u2019s PhD in Clinical Psychology came from an online accreditation program.\n\nAfter Rachel\u2019s raw introduction video, the surgeons decided that she needed an eye lift, liposuction, breast lift, nose job, lip enhancement, chin implants, endobrow lift and veneers, while a trainer prescribed a 1,200 calorie diet and two cardio sessions a day.\n\nRachel was given a nose job, lip enhancement and chin implants (Picture: YouTube)\n\nDr Terry Dubrow said: \u2018I think she\u2019s a difficult physical transformation. What do you want to do with that nose?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Ianni pledged to delve into the insecurity transferred to her by her husband and father \u2013 with Rachel\u2019s husband Mike saying in a VT: \u2018She\u2019s a little average. But when she\u2019s happy she\u2019s a very beautiful person.\u2019\n\nA writer for the show Rebecca Hertz later told Entertainment Weekly: \u2018In a pre-interview, I led her husband to say Rachel looks average, but he thought she looked beautiful.\n\n\u2018I cut it down to him saying she looks average, so he sounded like a mean, horrible a**hole. He was furious when he saw the show.\u2019 (Rachel and Mike later divorced, much like many of the other couples featured on the show.)\n\nAfter the three-month period, in which they underwent gruelling, invasive surgeries rendering them unrecognisable and \u2019emotional transformations\u2019, the women were debuted to the team in a glamorous reveal, with the doctors and show hosts fawning over them as they entered a ballroom.\n\nEach women \u2013 who had been banned from looking in the mirror for their journey \u2013 pulled back a curtain to look in the mirror for the first time, to see their transformation from \u2018ugly duckling\u2019 to a \u2018swan\u2019. The women usually reacted tearfully, commenting on how beautiful they were now their entire appearance has been changed.\n\nEach week, one contestant was eliminated, leaving room for eight of them to compete in a pageant at the end of the series, consisting of an evening gown round, swimsuit round, lingerie round and a Q&A, to decide who was the winner of The Swan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show was cancelled after two series, both of which aired in the same year, but the first series pulled in 9.1 million viewers on average. Pretty good for a show that was universally abhorred by critics \u2013 although perhaps the phrase \u2018all publicity is good publicity\u2019 came good in this instance.\n\nIn her book Reality Bites Back, Jennifer Pozner called The Swan \u2018the most sadistic reality series of the decade\u2019, while the show gained a resurgence of hatred and international attention in 2009 and 2010 when it aired for the first time on Channel 4 \u2013 with Charlie Brooker discussing The Swan on his show You Have Been Watching.\n\nMany contestants on the show have spoken out against it \u2013 most notably season one contestant Lorrie Arias, who was 34 when she went on the series and was given a tummy tuck, buttock lift, inner thigh lift, dual facelift, upper lip lift, upper and lower eye lift, endoscopic brow lift, rhinoplasty, breast augmentation and breast lift, the most procedures of any swan.\n\nIn 2010, Lorrie \u2013 who had lost 150 pounds herself in 1995- said she regained all the weight she lost in the aftermath of the series, and that she was depressed, bipolar, agoraphobic and suffering from body dysmorphic disorder.\n\nThe swans were allowed to see the new them after three months (Picture: YouTube)\n\nShe told the New York Post: \u2018I am agoraphobic, on meds and unable to enjoy life.\u2019\n\nAlleging that there was no aftercare from the show, she added: \u2018\u201cI had the most surgeries of any Swan in the history of the show and it has all gone to absolute s***. I am a 300-pound mess of a person who is afraid to go outside.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, not everybody on the show was as negative, with Rachel Love saying: \u2018Some of the girls have had problems with their surgeries, and I would have thought [the producers] would have helped a little more with that. But what can you expect from them?\n\n\u2018Reality shows aren\u2019t there to guide you for the rest of your life.\u2019\n\nAnd the show\u2019s creator Nely Galan defended The Swan \u2013 claiming getting a nip tuck is the same as getting your car a new paint job.\n\n\u2018People in America spend a lot of money,\u2019 she told the New York Post.\n\nCaroline will host The Surjury (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018If your wall in your house is falling apart and chipping, you fix it. If your car is messed up, you get a new paint job. Why would you walk around, after having three kids, with a stomach or boobs that are bothering you, when you can fix them?\u2019\n\nConsidering how bad The Swan was when it was on, it\u2019s remarkable that it has aged even worse. So it\u2019s no surprise that people are rather baffled that the series has seemingly been reincarnated in the form of The Surjury.\n\nChannel 4 has confirmed that Caroline Flack will present the new show, which will see people who want plastic surgery pitching their stories and requests to a group of strangers.\n\nThe jury will then decide who is granted their wishes to go under the knife.\n\nChannel 4 defended the premise amidst the controversy, saying: \u2018Rather than wag a disapproving finger, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 and allows those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice.\n\n\u2018The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities. All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord.\u2019\n\nFlack has also defended the series in a row with Jameela Jamil, noting that nobody has watched it yet \u2013 although one cosmetic doctor asked to be on the series told Metro.co.uk why he turned it down.\n\n\u2018I got approached ages ago to do the show and I was pitched an idea from their team about what potentially the programme could be\u2019, he explained.\n\n\u2018My initial understanding was that the people involved would be ones who were already thinking about getting surgery and then they would talk about why they wanted it done to a studio audience.\u2019\n\nHowever, when a press release was sent out, Dr Esho raised some concerns and realised it wouldn\u2019t be ethical to take part. \u2018I tried to get more information about the show and in the end, I couldn\u2019t get any more so it got to the point where I told my management that I couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u2018I had to look at it from an ethical point of view and to be responsible for the millennial generation.\u2019\n\nNone of us have seen The Surjury, expected to air in 2020, so it remains to be seen whether it will be different to the dangerous and exploitative premise that many are imagining. However, in The Swan, we\u2019ve already seen how a show offering people a life transformation via plastic surgery can go.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
