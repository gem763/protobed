These quotes should please Trump supporters, considering that Obama\u2019s narcissistic, antagonistic, partisan style got him reelected:\n\n\u201cLike a good salesman, Obama cannot stop selling his product \u2014 himself \u2014 long after the sale is finalized. It\u2019s as if he knows his God-given talents are more suited to \u2018campaigner in chief\u2019 than the expected chief executive/commander in chief.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Obama will continue to do up until November 6, 2012, is recite the same old red-meat rhetoric about how those scary Republicans messed things up so bad; thus, why on earth would you let them back into the White House?\u201d\n\n\u201cObama will have the trappings of power, the White House and Air Force One, all harnessed to raise more money than any political campaign in the history of the world, while on \u2018official business\u2019 by day and as \u2018fundraiser in chief\u2019 at night \u2014 usually in the same town, of course.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Myra Adams", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
