Since then, it\u2019s population has grown from 167 pairs to about 2,300 pairs as of the latest census.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action by the U.S Department of the Interior marks the latest chapter in a remarkable wildlife success story,\u201d Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Dan Eichinger said.\n\n\u201cThe bird\u2019s recovery provides dramatic testimony to what conservation organizations, governments and businesses can accomplish when they come together for the good of the resource.\u201d\n\nThe Kirtland\u2019s warbler population was edged out of northern Michigan by cowbirds, which lay their eggs in warbler nests. Cowbird chicks are much larger than the songbirds and are able to outcompete their smaller nest mates for food from warbler parents.\n\nState and federal wildlife officials ensured a more robust breeding habitat for Kirtland\u2019s warblers through large-scale timber harvesting. The birds build their nests in smaller jack pine trees, but modern wildfire suppression meant the trees grew too large for the birds.\n\n\u201cPrivate forest owners are proud partners in this major milestone and committed to the long-term health of the Kirtland\u2019s warbler,\u201d said Dave Tenny, founding president and CEO of the National Alliance of Forest Owners.\n\n\u201cPrivate forest owners are an essential part of conservation success \u2014 360 million acres of working forests across the country are privately owned. We proudly work with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and conservation partners to develop and implement smart management decisions that support a wide range of wildlife across the country.\u201d\n\nThe FWS announcement comes two months after the Interior Department said it planned to overhaul the ESA to limit which animals are allowed on the endangered species list and allow the government to consider economic factors when deciding threats to wildlife.\n\nIn September, a coalition of 17 states, Washington, D.C., and the city of New York filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the rollbacks of the ESA.\n\nThe lawsuit states that the changes are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, unauthorized under the Endangered Species Act and unlawful under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nIt specifically cites the actions to \u201cinject economic considerations\u201d into the act\u2019s analyses, restrict the circumstances under which species can be listed as threatened and reduce consultation and analyses required before taking federal action, among other aspects.\n\n\u201cAs we face the unprecedented threat of a climate emergency now is the time to strengthen our planet\u2019s biodiversity, not destroy it,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. \u201cThe only thing we want to see extinct are the beastly policies of the Trump administration putting our ecosystems in critical danger.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service removed federal protection Tuesday for a songbird that calls northern Michigan home after the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
