It\u2019s going to be easy.\u201d\n\nAntetokounmpo figures to again play solo lead in Milwaukee, where he\u2019ll be fueled by the Bucks\u2019 inability to get the job done against the Raptors in the Eastern Conference finals last season.\n\nThe \u201cGreek Freak,\u201d still just 24, heads into his seventh NBA season a bona fide superstar \u2014 leading a team that many consider the top pick in the East.\n\nThat\u2019s a status 19-year-old Zion Williamson is expected to attain almost immediately.\n\nWilliamson, the high school standout who became a collegiate star before he was drafted number one overall by the Pelicans, burned through the pre-season, averaging 23.3 points in 27.3 minutes per game.\n\nOnly Antetokounmpo, Harden and Curry \u2014 MVPs all \u2014 scored at a higher clip during the exhibition season.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 It\u2019s a whole new ballgame in the NBA, where a seismic shift in star talent has flung the door wide open to an array of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/62280e_star-power-los-angeles-lakers-set-contend-in-upcoming-nba-season-lebron-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
