A party that permits anti-Jewish racism to flourish cannot be called anti-racist.\"\n\n(Image: Chris J Ratcliffe)\n\nDame Louise went on to claim that Jeremy Corbyn had spent three decades on the back benches of the House of Commons \"consorting with, and never confronting, antisemitism, Holocaust deniers and terrorist\".\n\nThe 73-year-old was born in Manchester into an observant Jewish family.\n\nMike Katz, chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement, claimed Dame Louise had been \"bullied and hounded out of her party\".\n\nHe added that it was heartbreaking the MP had been 'driven out' of her party after 55 years of membership - and more than 20 years as the MP for Liverpool Riverside.\n\nMr Katz said she was pushed out by 'a leader and leadership unwilling and unable to get a grip on the institutional anti-Jewish racism infecting the party'.\n\nHe said: \"We salute Louise's bravery in standing up to the racists and bullies in her local party and beyond, and for her service to the Jewish community.\n\n\"She's the second female Jewish MP to be hounded out of the Labour Party. What clearer signal can there be that, as Dame Louise says, Labour is currently not a safe space for Jews.\n\n\"This is a day of great shame for the Labour Party.\"\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said that the Labour Party was 'finished as a serious force' if there was no place for Dame Louise in its ranks.\n\nAs a teenager, the politician was involved in the Labour Zionist Habonim Dror - a socialist Zionist movement - before spending a year in Israel studying Hebrew, the Jewish Chronicle reported.\n\nThe motion moved by her constituency members last week read: \u201cWe have no confidence that our MP Louise Ellman will carry out the wishes of our CLP (Constituency Labour Party) and our Riverside constituency or that she will follow Labour Party policy.\n\n\"This branch therefore call on our Riverside MP, Louise Ellman, to resign.\"\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: \"Jeremy Corbyn thanks Louise Ellman for her service to the Labour Party over many years.\n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and continue to take robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party and wider society.\n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn has consistently supported struggles for human rights and justice around the world and made the right calls in the interests of security and peace.\"", "description": "Dame Louise Ellman \naccused the Labour Party's leader Jeremy Corbyn of 'consorting' with Holocaust deniers and terrorists", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Splashnews.Com", "Chris J Ratcliffe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637866.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JHP_MDM_080617LIVERPOOL_46.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
