It culminated in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s funeral march calling for the event to end in its current form, with the group criticising the clothing industry as a major offender in the climate crisis.\n\nExtinction Rebellion kept to the drama of which fashion is so fond. Starting at Trafalgar Square, a group of about 200 people \u2013 some in funereal outfits complete with black veils \u2013 gathered around two black coffins. \u201cRIP LFW 1983-2019\u201d read one, while the other simply said \u201cOur Future\u201d. They were accompanied by a live band as they made their way up to 180 The Strand, a venue that hosted fashion week shows.\n\n'It's finding something new in the old': how fashion can confront the climate crisis Read more\n\nHere they laid the coffin down, with participants throwing flowers on it. A speech urging the industry to bring an end to a system where each season means new clothes was perhaps less well received.\n\nThe crowd also stopped outside the flagship store of H&M, a giant of fast fashion. Safia Minney, the founder of Fair Trade clothing company People Tree made an impassioned speech about how fashion needed to change its ways. \u201cI\u2019m calling on London fashion week to have the courage and the strength to change everything it does,\u201d she said, while behind her, standing hands outstretched, several young people dressed in red robes.\n\nThe protesters were mainly young. Mohan Keryk, 17, said the action was the start of things to come: \u201cWe have to continuously be active. We need the change.\u201d Tolmeia Gregory, 19, who described herself as an environmental activist and sustainable fashion blogger, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a big mindset shift that needs to happen. It\u2019s an emergency, but a lot of people aren\u2019t there yet.\u201d\n\nThe group maintains that it appreciates the creativity of fashion. This was certainly clear by the outfits on display \u2013 one young male protester wore a police officer\u2019s helmet, high heels and gloves with crystals, and another had a picture hat and floor-length black cape covering their face, decorated with only sunglasses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An Extinction Rebellion protester on The Strand in London.

The event was standing room only. Experts including the journalist Tamsin Blanchard, the model and environmentalist Arizona Muse, Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Bel Jacobs and the designer Phoebe English discussed issues around the climate emergency.\n\nThe panel discussed how fast fashion was the biggest polluter, with Jacobs commenting she would \u201clove to give the Heading for Extinction talk at Boohoo\u201d. A rental model, growing in scope within high fashion, was mooted as an alternative option for the sector.\n\nEighteen months ago, English took a two-season hiatus from fashion shows to reboot. \u201cThe more you read, the more horrendous the realisation becomes. For a time I was waking up and saying: \u2018Why am I doing this? What is the actual point of what I do?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was an experiment \u2013 I was like: \u2018I\u2019ll try this thing, and maybe I\u2019ll have to close down.\u2019 But then, I found hunting for the solutions really exciting and reinvigorating.\u201d English argued that the most important objective was \u201cmaking excess unfashionable\u201d.\n\nThe funeral is the culmination of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s actions at London fashion week. They also staged a die-in outside one of the show venues on Friday and a swarm outside Victoria Beckham\u2019s show on Sunday, with protesters holding placards reading \u201cfashion = ecocide\u201d and \u201cthe ugly truth about fashion\u201d.\n\nThe group is targeting the fashion industry for its actual environmental impact. The United Nations has said it uses more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined, with a projected 63% increase in the global consumption of apparel by 2030. Extinction Rebellion says the industry also gives the impression that the world is not in a climate emergency.\n\n\u201cCulture is complicit in our destruction, when it should be taking responsibility for people getting their heads around this existential problem,\u201d said Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Sara Arnold .", "description": "The activist group focused on fast fashion as a major factor in the climate crisis and called for drastic reform", "authors": ["Lauren Cochrane"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a57cf77cd338ee63a72b7344083113cecabac4c/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c34d50ad7d257de1eb9ac0fb7f801ce", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
