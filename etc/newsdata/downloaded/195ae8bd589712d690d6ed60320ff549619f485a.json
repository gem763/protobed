USA TODAY\n\nAustralian airline Qantas is testing its first nearly 20-hour nonstop flight from New York to Sydney Friday night, with 50 passengers and crew members along for the \"research\" ride.\n\nQantas is using this flight as an opportunity to see how passengers and crew fair with a flight that's close to a full day long. The airline wants to help minimize jet leg, figure out the best rest and work periods for the crew and overall health and wellness of those aboard.\n\nThis will mark the first flight of Qantas' Project Sunrise project, which if approved, would see commercial flights begin in 2022 or 2023. The airline is expected make a decision about Project Sunrise by the end of the year.\n\nFour pilots will rotate throughout the 19-and-a-half-hour flight, with two other pilots also in the cabin.

According to the airline's press release at the time, its test marks the first-ever direct commercial flight between New York and Sydney and only the second between London and Sydney.\n\nThe Boeing 787-9 aircraft used for the research flight was not specifically made for this 10,200-mile trip, but will fly with maximum fuel and a smaller passenger and baggage load \u2014 plus no cargo \u2014 so it can travel non-stop.\n\n\"Ultra-long haul flying presents a lot of common sense questions about the comfort and well being of passengers and crew. These flights are going to provide invaluable data to help answer them,\" CEO Alan Joyce said in the August press release.\n\nJoyce said the airline would make a decision about whether to pursue the ultra-long-haul flights by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, business agreements and other economic factors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of enthusiasm for Sunrise, but it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion,\" Joyce added. \"This is ultimately a business decision and the economics have to stack up.\"\n\nRemember this?: Pop stars The Veronicas at the center of Qantas flight drama, escorted off plane\n\nYikes: Qantas flight attendant was left shaking after \u2019body slam\u2019 from passenger, witness says\n\nContributing: Jayme Deerwester\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/18/qantas-airways-20-hour-flight-new-york-sydney-debuts/4021349002/", "description": "Australian airline Qantas is testing its first nearly 20-hour nonstop flight from New York to Sydney Friday night.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Published A.M.
