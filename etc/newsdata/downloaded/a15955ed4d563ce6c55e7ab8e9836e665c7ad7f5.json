Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nHappy Friday,\n\nWelcome to another edition of Cultivated. I spent much of the week chatting with folks from all over the cannabis industry at the Arcview Investor Forum, which has handily located seven floors below Business Insider's headquarters.\n\nI interviewed Trulieve CEO Kim Rivers on the main stage on Wednesday where our discussion touched on what it's like to be one of the few female CEOs of a publicly-traded cannabis company, how she's working to \"inject diversity\" into her board and throughout the company, as well as some more nuts-and-bolts stuff about the business.\n\nCheck out my top cannabis stories from this week below, including an exclusive report on dangerous chemicals in illicit vapes, Square jumping into the CBD industry, and a rundown of the key lessons startup CEOs learned while raising venture capital in the crazy cannabis industry.\n\n-Jeremy\n\nHere's what we wrote about this week:\n\nIn a new report shared exclusively with Business Insider, California cannabis-testing lab CannaSafe found that out of 12 illicit vape cartridges tested, nine contained dangerously high levels of Vitamin E acetate. All of them contained pesticides.\n\nOut of 104 legal vapes tested, none contained vitamin E acetate or banned pesticides, and all matched their THC label claims.\n\nCannabis startup founders share 4 critical lessons they learned while raising money in the unique industry Cannabis startups \u2014 both cannabis-tech and 'plant-touching' \u2014 have to get creative to raise money since THC is federally illegal in the US. Most large venture funds still won't touch the industry, so there's a dearth of growth-stage capital, founders say. Cannabis startup founders shared four key lessons for raising money in the unique industry with Business Insider. Square's top lawyer explains what's behind the company's push into the trendy CBD space Square is rolling out its full payment-processing platform to all CBD sellers in the US. The company is opening up its platform to CBD sellers after it conducted a three-month \"invite-only\" beta program, which started in May, for a small group of CBD startups. Square is solving one of the biggest issues for CBD merchants, which often have to use high-risk payroll processors and pay exorbitantly high fees.\n\nCapital raises, M&A activity, partnerships, and launches\n\nPathogenDx, a DNA-based testing technology for the cannabis and hemp industries, closed a $7.5 million Series B round led by Entourage Effect Capital, Altitude Investment Management, and more.\n\nCresco Capital Partners announced its name change to Entourage Effect Capital. The firm is launching a new fund with an initial target of $150 million, managing partner Matt Hawkins told me on the sidelines of the Arcview conference.\n\nCanopy Growth purchased a 72% stake in Biosteel Sports, with a path to complete ownership. As part of the deal, Canopy and Biosteel will produce a CBD-infused beverage as soon as regulations permit.\n\nCannabis website Leafly has launched a super-cool new tool: The Leafly Cannabis Guide. Built by Harvard Neuroscience Ph.D. and Leafly data scientist Nick Jikomes, the tool breaks down the active compounds in cannabis \u2014 including the terpenes and cannabinoids \u2014 and puts it into a handy visualization tool so you can see exactly what's in your strain.\n\nVape company Dosist is launching a dose-controlled sublingual THC tablet. CEO Gunner Winston told me he saw a need in the market for micro-dosable, non-vape consumption methods.\n\nExecutive moves\n\nEllen Deutsch, a former Haines executive, is joining Stem Holdings as COO.\n\nEx-NBA player Jamal Mashburn is joining Revolution Enterprises as an advisor to the board.\n\nFormer Aphria president Jakob Ripshtein is joining the Israel-based Seedo's advisory board.\n\nNina Simosko, previously the CEO of NTT Innovation Institute Inc is joining the NASDAQ-listed Akerna Corp as Chief Revenue Officer.\n\nStories from around the web\n\nDid I miss anything?
