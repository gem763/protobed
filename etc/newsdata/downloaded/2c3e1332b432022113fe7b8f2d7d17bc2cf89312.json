In April, it said it would close at least 159 underperforming and unprofitable stores, or nearly 30% of its total outlets.\n\n\"Despite our team's best efforts, we were not able to avoid this outcome,\" Chief Executive Officer Joe Anto said.\n\nThe company has begun promotion and discounts at its retail locations which are expected to close over the next 60 days as it liquidates its business.\n\nFred's said it would continue to fulfill prescriptions at most of its pharmacy locations and would continue to pursue the sale of the business as part of court supervised proceedings.\n\nIt has also filed a motion seeking approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to enter into a proposed debtor-in-possession financing agreement with some of its existing lenders, which would provide for up to $35 million in new funding, the company said.\n\nShares of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company, which have lost nearly all their value since the company was forced to scrap its bid for 1,200 Rite Aid Corp stores in June 2017, plunged to 15 cents in early trading.
