Trump claimed that he has \"good relationship with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un,\" and added, \"There's been no nuclear testing at all.\"\n\nProdded about North Korea's frantic short-range missile launches in recent months, Trump reiterated that they are insignificant. \"We didn't have an agreement on short-range missiles. And a lot of people and a lot of countries test short-range missiles,\" he said. \"There's nothing spectacular about that.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of another meeting with Kim, Trump said, \"Right now people like to see that happen. I want to know what is going to be coming out of it. We can know a lot before the summit takes place.\"\n\n", "description": "Trump Boasts He Prevented War with N.Korea", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/09/24/2019092401131_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
