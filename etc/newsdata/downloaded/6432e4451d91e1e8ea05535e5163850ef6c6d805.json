RSPCA ACT /via REUTERS\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian sheep who made headlines in 2015 for the record-breaking weight of his fleece has died, according to the carers of the Merino named Chris.\n\nThe animal, believed to be aged about 10, was found dead on Tuesday morning by his minders, having died of old age, said Kate Luke, co-founder and vice president of the Canberra-based Little Oak Sanctuary, a charity that shelters over 180 farm animals.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken at the loss of this sweet, wise, friendly soul. Chris is known as the world record holder for having grown the heaviest fleece on record,\u201d the sanctuary said in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cHe was so much more than this, so very much more, and we will remember him for all that he was - someone, not something.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Chris the sheep was discovered on the northern outskirts of Australian capital Canberra, struggling to walk under the weight of his wool, which had not be shorn in more than five years.
