It was really fun,\u201d Ihus said.\n\nPRO ATHLETES UNITE TO BRING WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL AND HEALING TO THOSE TRAPPED IN WAR\n\nThe next thing she knew, Smith went to the register and then \u201chanded me this huge bag of clothes,\" Ihus said.\n\n\u201cShe gave me a hug and started to cry,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI wanted to cry. Honestly, I was just happy to do something nice for her because she was having a rough day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was amazing, I was like, \u2018Are you serious?\u2019 I didn\u2019t expect anything at all. I just needed to tell someone what was going on, and there she is -- She just showed up and offered to buy clothing. It was amazing,\u201d Ihus said. \u201cIt definitely brightened my day because I was definitely not in the mood to go shopping, and she made it fun.\u201d\n\nSmith and Ihus hugged and exchanged contact information.\n\nIhus introduced Smith to John Henry on Wednesday after she came to visit them in the hospital.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith is optimistic that John Henry will be \u201crunning circles around his mother in no time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be her superhero,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn Henry is expected to stay in the hospital for at least another three months, Ihus said.\n\nSmith said the newfound friends are already planning a trip to go to Disney World when Ihus returns to Florida with John Henry in the future.\n\n\u201cThis is a lifetime friendship. We\u2019re bonded, we are bound together,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cAt least I know there are good people out there,\u201d Ihus said.\n\n\u201cI just really feel that a lot of people need to have a little more warmness in their hearts and stop being so caught up in everything and look at people around you because you never know what they are going through,\u201d Smith added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A Florida Uber driver picked up a new mother\u00a0from a children\u2019s hospital and bought her clothing for her sick baby, telling Fox News on Thursday, \u201cI was just happy to do something nice for her because she was having a rough day.\u201d", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
