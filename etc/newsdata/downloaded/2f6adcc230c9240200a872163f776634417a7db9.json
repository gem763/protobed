It argues that Trump overstepped his authority when he issued the declaration to gain access to additional funds for his border wall, despite receiving $1.375 billion from Congress.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Judge-Trump-Border-Wall-Funds Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
