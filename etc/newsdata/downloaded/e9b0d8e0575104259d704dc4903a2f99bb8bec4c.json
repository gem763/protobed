He certainly has no interest in the Terrapins wallowing in back-to-back losses, including a record-setting defeat against Penn State.\n\n\u201cPlays within a game have a shelf life, which means when the play is over, you have to get to get to the next play,\u201d the first-year coach said Tuesday. \u201cWell, so do games. Whether it\u2019s games where we have great success or games like the most recent one against Penn State where we weren\u2019t very good, we need to move on.\u201d\n\nAfter a burst featuring 142 points in the first two games and the program\u2019s first national ranking since 2013, the Terrapins (2-2, 0-1 Big Ten) have sputtered in their last two outings. On Sept. 14, there was a series of red zone problems in a 20-17 loss at Temple .\n\nThen, in front of the sixth-largest crowd in school history, Maryland absorbed a 59-0 drubbing against Penn State. It was the Terps\u2019 most lopsided home shutout loss ever, breaking a 111-year-old record.\n\n\u201cWe think as a team, we think a lot about each other and what we can do,\u201d safety Antoine Brooks Jr. said. \u201cWe think we can do better, and we are going to do better.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks into the season, the Terps led the country in scoring offense (71.0 points a game) and ranked fourth in both total offense (636.5 yards) and rushing offense (335.6). In its last two games, Maryland is averaging 8.5 points, 234 total yards and 110.5 rushing yards.\n\nMaryland\u2019s setbacks aren\u2019t confined to game results, either. The Terps entered the season with enviable running back depth, but injuries have already eroded it. Junior Jake Funk suffered a torn ACL against Temple, and Lorenzo Harrison III will undergo surgery after tearing an MCL and partially tearing an ACL against Penn State.\n\nBut Maryland also needs better play from quarterback Josh Jackson if it is to stabilize its season against the Scarlet Knights (1-3, 0-2). Jackson threw for 541 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception in the Terps\u2019 two victories, but has just 248 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions in his last two outings.\n\nThe Terps have also allowed eight sacks in their two losses, compared to just one over the season\u2019s first two weeks.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had trouble in protections in first and second downs,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cIt\u2019s been third down that\u2019s been our Achilles\u2019 heel the last two games. We\u2019ve been in some terrible third-down situations which aren\u2019t favorable for anybody.\u201d\n\nLocksley has preached concentrating on matters inside the program rather than fretting about opponents since arriving in December, an attitude especially pertinent this week since Rutgers just fired coach Chris Ash on Sunday. The Scarlet Knights elevated Nunzio Campanile to interim coach.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of how Rutgers will respond to its coaching shuffle, there\u2019s an even greater onus on the Terps to simply handle their own fundamentals better while they look to revive their season.\n\n\u201cAlignment, assignment, effort, execution and finish - when we do those five things, we\u2019re the team that beat Howard and beat Syracuse,\u201d tight end Tyler Mabry said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t do the things we\u2019re supposed to do, (we\u2019re what) you saw against Temple and you saw against Penn State.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Maryland coach Mike Locksley wants the Terrapins focusing on only one thing: their Big Ten matchup at Rutgers.
