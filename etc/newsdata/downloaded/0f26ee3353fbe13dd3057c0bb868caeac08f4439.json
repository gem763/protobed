Georgie enthused as her co-star placed the entire marshmallow inside his mouth.\n\n'Here we go! All in one!' she cheered as a wincing Tom chewed away.\n\nIs this what it takes to beat Sunrise? Today's Tom Steinfort gagged in disgust as he ate an entire marshmallow full of insects on live television this Wednesday morning\n\nTom momentarily pretended to gag by dramatically lurching forward, prompting Georgie to ask him: Is there a bit of crunch to it?'\n\n'It's a weird crunch, but it taste like a marshmallow and an insect,' Tom replied confidently as he effortlessly gulped down the remainder of the snack.\n\nHowever, the journalist simply couldn't keep his cool and ended up gagging moments later.\n\nWould YOU eat this? 'This marshmallow has a ginormous bug on it,' Tom told co-host Georgie Garnder as he gingerly picked up the spongy snack\n\n'There it is.... oh...', Tom groaned, turning away from the camera.\n\n'Watch out for the wings in your throat! laughed the brand owner.\n\nIt's unclear whether eating insects on live television will help to boost Today's dwindling ratings however.\n\nAccording to TV Tonight, the breakfast program delivered some of its lowest ratings all year, with just 169,000 metro viewers tuning in on September 23.", "description": "He's proven himself to be a formidable member of the Today team.", "authors": ["Monique Friedlander For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/01/20063558-0-image-a-30_1571792282147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
