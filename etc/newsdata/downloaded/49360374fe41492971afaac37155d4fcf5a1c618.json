CHEAP!\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better than humiliating your friends\u2026 in a heated PlayStation showdown. But if you wanna wreck your buds online (because what else is gaming good for), then you\u2019re gonna need a PlayStation Plus subscription. Especially if you don\u2019t want them to swing by your dirty crib for an IRL multiplayer session.\n\nWorry no more, we\u2019ve got you covered. There\u2019s currently some handy discounts on one-year Plus subscriptions out there. You can grab one for $39,99 \u2014 $20 bucks cheaper than from the official PlayStation store. That means $20 more you can spend on games, or chips, or whatever. Hell yeah, my dude(ss).\n\n\u201cFuck, I\u2019ve got no friends to play with,\u201d I hear your concerns, dog. The good thing about Plus is there\u2019s tons of other losers like you out there to interact with. They say your best friends are the ones most comfortable with insulting you. If that\u2019s true, you\u2019d be happy to know that with Plus, you\u2019ll have thousands of best friends. Trust me, I know from experience.\n\nGod, I love friendship. But if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s cool. There\u2019s more benefits to Plus than that, ya know. A Plus sub gives you 100GB of cloud storage and two free games each month.\n\nAnyways, you get the point: why feed Sony $20 extra when you don\u2019t have to? Feed yourself, get the Plus for $39,99 (instead of $59.99) by clicking here.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
