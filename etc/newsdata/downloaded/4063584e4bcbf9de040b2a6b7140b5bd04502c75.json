The fading stimulus from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year.\n\nThere are concerns that the slump in business investment will eventually spill over to consumer spending and significantly restrain economic growth. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank did not see that risk, citing a strong labor market.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t see it,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cThe consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report that consumers are doing well and are focused on the good jobs market and rising incomes.\u201d\n\nGross domestic product increased at a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter, also as businesses maintained a steady pace of inventory accumulation, exports rose and the housing market rebounded after contracting for six straight quarters, the government said in its advance estimate of GDP.\n\nThe economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP increasing at a 1.6% rate in the July-September quarter. Third-quarter growth marked a further slowdown from the brisk 3.1% rate notched in the first three months of the year. Still, the economy is expanding at its potential, estimated between 1.7% and 2.0%.\n\nThe GDP report showed the overall trend in inflation remaining moderate last quarter.\n\nThe dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.\n\nRECESSION FEARS EBBING\n\nRecession fears have subsided in recent months mainly on hopes of a resolution to the 15-month trade war. President Donald Trump this month announced a truce, delaying additional tariffs that were due in October. But a trade deal is far from certain. Sources close to the negotiations say Trump\u2019s demand that Beijing commit to big purchases of American farm products has become a major sticking point in talks.\n\nDespite last quarter\u2019s better-than-expected performance, the economy is expected to again miss the White House\u2019s ambitious goal of 3.0% annual growth this year. It grew 2.9% last year.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An assembly line worker works on the production line at Midwest Automotive Designs in Bristol, Indiana, U.S., April 16, 2019.

But moderating job growth, ebbing consumer confidence and stalling wage gains are raising doubts about the consumer\u2019s resilience.\n\nIncome at the disposal of households rose at a 4.5% rate in the third quarter compared to a 4.8% pace in the prior period.\n\nA separate report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased by 125,000 jobs in October after rising 93,000 in September. Job gains have been slowing this year because of slowing demand and worker shortages.\n\n\u201cIf hiring weakens any further, unemployment will begin to rise,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nTrade tensions are undercutting capital expenditure. Business investment dropped at a 3.0% rate in the third quarter, the sharpest contraction in more than 3-1/2 years, after falling at a 1.0% rate in the second quarter. It was pulled down by declines in spending on equipment and nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells.\n\nDesign problems at aerospace giant Boeing (BA.N) have also hurt business investment. The world\u2019s largest planemaker last week reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit because of the grounding in March of its best-selling 737 MAX jets following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nWhile that undermined investment, the planes rolling from the production lines contributed to the $69.0 billion pace of increase in inventories last quarter. Inventories rose at a $69.4 billion rate in the April-June period. They trimmed GDP growth by only 0.05 percentage point in the third quarter compared to 0.91 percentage point in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cIt appears as though aircraft, including the 737 MAX, accounted for at most one-fourth of the increase in private inventories in third quarter,\u201d said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\n\nThe rebound in exports blunted a surge in imports, leading to a narrowing in the trade deficit. Trade subtracted a negligible 0.08 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter after cutting 0.68 percentage point in the prior period.\n\nGovernment spending cooled after rising at its fastest pace in 10 years in the second quarter. Spending on homebuilding increased at a 5.1% rate, rising for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2017, thanks to lower interest rates.", "description": "U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a further contraction in business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446533541&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T13U", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
