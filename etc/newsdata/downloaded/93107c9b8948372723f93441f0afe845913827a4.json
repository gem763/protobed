GeoBeats\n\nTalk about a tight squeeze: You can practically hear the 900-plus passengers of the MS Braemar holding their breath as the 74-foot-wide (22.5 meters) Fred. Olsen Cruise Line ship squeezed through the narrowest stretch of Greece's Corinth Canal, where it measures about 79 feet (24 meters) across.\n\nAccording to a press release from Fred. Olsen, the Braemar became the largest vessel to pass through the canal, which separates the Greek mainland from the Peloponnese peninsula, on Oct. 9.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting sailing and tremendous milestone in Fred. Olsen\u2019s 171-year history, and we are thrilled to have been able to share it with our guests,\" said Clare Ward, the cruise line's product and customer service director in a press release commemorating the record.\n\nThe MS Braemar is about 74 feet wide; the Corinth Canal is about 79 feet wide at its narrowest point. (Photo: Fred Olsen Cruise Line)\n\nWard continued, \"At Fred. Olsen, we strive to create memories that last a lifetime, and with guests onboard Braemar able to get so close to the edges of the Corinth Canal that they could almost touch the sides, we know that this will be a holiday that they will never forget.\"\n\nThe Bahamian-flagged Braemar, which departed Southampton, England, on Sept. 27, is 18 days into a 25-night cruise through the Greek islands, Spain and Portugal.\n\nOn Monday, commercial ship tracker VesselFinder reported it passed through another narrow waterway, the Strait of Messina, which separates the Italian mainland from Sicily. The boat had a lot more breathing room this time since the Strait of Messina is nearly two miles wide at its narrowest point.\n\nThe passengers paid a pretty penny to witness the record: According to Fred. Olsen, Prices for the 25-day sailing start at more than $5,500 (\u00a34399) per person.\n\nWoah: Norwegian Cruise Line passengers demand refunds after ship skips several scheduled stops\n\nUh oh: Carnival passenger critically injured after falling onto lower cruise ship deck\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2019/10/14/cruise-ship-passes-through-greek-canal-5-feet-breathing-room/3973369002/", "description": "Fred Olsen Cruise Lines says its MS Braemar set a record for the biggest ship to pass through Greece's narrow Corinth Canal on Oct. 9.", "authors": ["Jayme Deerwester", "Published A.M.
