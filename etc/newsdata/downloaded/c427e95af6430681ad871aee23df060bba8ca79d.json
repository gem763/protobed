Sign up here.\n\nChina signaled it would hit back after the Trump administration placed eight of the country\u2019s technology giants on a blacklist over alleged human rights violations against Muslim minorities.\n\nAsked Tuesday whether China would retaliate over the blacklist, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters \u201cstay tuned.\u201d He also denied that the government abused human rights in the far west region of Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cWe urge the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistake, withdraw the relevant decision and stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Geng said in Beijing. \u201cChina will continue to take firm and forceful measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move, which was announced after U.S. markets closed, came on the same day negotiators from the two sides began working-level preparations for high-level talks due to begin Thursday in Washington. A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said the \u201caction is unrelated to the trade negotiations,\u201d and China confirmed Vice Premier Liu He would lead the delegation as planned.\n\nThe blacklist, first reported by Reuters, still takes President Donald Trump\u2019s economic war against China in a new direction, marking the first time his administration has cited human rights as a reason for action. Past moves to blacklist companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. have been taken on national security grounds.\n\nThe companies on the blacklist include two video surveillance companies -- Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. -- that by some accounts control as much as a third of the global market for video surveillance and have cameras all over the world.\n\nAlso targeted were SenseTime Group Ltd. -- the world\u2019s most valuable artificial intelligence startup -- and fellow AI giant Megvii Technology Ltd., which is said to be aiming to raise up to $1 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering. Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the pair are at the forefront of China\u2019s ambition to dominate AI in coming years.\n\nEntities on the list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without being granted a U.S. government license, although some have maintained relationships with banned companies through international subsidiaries. Hikvision and Dahua were suspended from trading Tuesday, but iFlytek Co. -- one of the eight singled out -- slid 2.7% in Shenzhen.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\u201d in Xinjiang, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a federal register notice published Monday.\n\nThe foreign ministry\u2019s Geng accused the U.S. of having \u201csinister intentions.\u201d \u201cThe measures taken by China to eliminate extremism from the roots are fully in line with Chinese law and international practice,\u201d he said.\n\nSenseTime and Dahua weren\u2019t immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours.\n\n\u201cHikvision strongly opposes today\u2019s decision by the U.S. government and it will hamper efforts by global companies to improve human rights around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cPunishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision\u2019s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nMegvii said the U.S. had \u201cno grounds\u201d to put it on the list, and noted that Human Rights Watch had corrected a report that implicated the company. It added that it hadn\u2019t earned revenue from Xinjiang in the first part of the year, and the impact on its business from the designation was minimal.\n\nThe blacklist comes as Trump faces growing pressure at home to support pro-democracy protests in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong. On Monday, Trump said he was hoping for a \u201chumane solution\u201d in a city where protests have grown increasingly violent.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say:\n\n\u201cWith growth fading, the U.S. and China could both use at least a reprieve from trade tensions. A mini-deal was mooted. It now looks less likely.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China signaled it would hit back after the Trump administration placed eight of the country\u2019s technology giants on a blacklist over alleged human rights violations against Muslim minorities.Asked Tuesday whether China would retaliate over the blacklist, foreign ministry spokesman Geng", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wcBe3nN6Q.Df8Wz6NuEPmg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/244cea462aa359218be833e23c524b7d", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
