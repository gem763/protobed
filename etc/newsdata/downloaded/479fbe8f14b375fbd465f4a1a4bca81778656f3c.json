And it was highly maneuverable, so it could out fly its likely adversary in the Foxbat and other MiG jets.\n\nBut McDonnell Douglas and the US Air Force wanted to prove that the F-15 was superior to anything Russia had before pilots clashed in actual combat. After all, if your enemy knows their likely to lose in a real battle, they'll hopefully just stay home.\n\nSo they took a pre-production version of the F-15 and stripped everything unnecessary off of it, to include the bulk of its paint. It had an Air Force graphic on the fuselage, but the standard gray, anti-corrosion paint was removed to save even that little bit of weight. Their goal was to set all of the major time-to-climb records for planes.\n\nThe McDonnell Douglas F-15 Streak Eagle is currently in storage at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. US Air Force/Ken LaRock\n\nIf time-to-climb sounds like a niche record to compete on, it's actually super important to air combat. Speed, max altitude, and acceleration are all important as well.\n\nBut speed in a climb determines which plane in a dogfight is likely to get above the other while they're maneuvering. And altitude equates to extra energy and speed in a fight, because the higher pilot works with gravity instead of against it while attacking.\n\nAnd so, in just two weeks in late January to February 1975, Air Force pilots took the \"Streak Eagle\" on a series of flights where they broke eight world time-to-climb records. Five of the records had been held by another McDonnell Douglas aircraft, the F-4 Phantom. But three of them had been held by the Russian MiG-25 Foxbat until the Eagle came calling for them.\n\nThe first record was shattered on January 16, 1975. Maj. Robert Smith took off from North Dakota in freezing weather. Smith conducted a 5G pull-up and rocketed up past 3,000 meters, over 9,840 feet. He hit his mark in 27.57 seconds, shattering the old 34.5 record.\n\nThe McDonnell Douglas F-15 Streak Eagle is currently in storage at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

Another pilot destroyed the 15,000-meter record by 37.5 seconds, breaching the altitude in just 77.05 seconds.\n\nAnd yes, all three pilots were flying the same Streak Eagle. They went on to beat the Foxbat's records for 20,000 meters, 25,000 meters, and 30,000 meters in the following two weeks. The 30,000-meter record was beaten in just under 3.5 minutes. That 30,000 meters number equates to 98,425 feet, and the pilot coasted to 103,000 feet before beginning his descent.\n\nThe Streak Eagle used in all of these record-setting flights is now in the National Museum of the US Air Force.", "description": "In the 1970s, the US Air Force and McDonnell Douglas wanted to prove the F-15 was the best fighter out there.", "authors": ["We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cde852e22af63072c8ede-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
