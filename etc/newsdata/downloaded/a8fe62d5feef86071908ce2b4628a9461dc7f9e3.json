Lou Carroll via REUTERS\n\n(Reuters) - Hurricane Dorian, which battered the Bahamas early on Monday, could cause insurance industry losses of up to $25 billion, according to analysts at UBS.\n\nDorian, the second-strongest Atlantic storm on record, was forecast to pound the archipelago through the day, then move slowly toward the east U.S. coast, where authorities ordered more than a million people evacuated in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nUBS analysts updated their model to reflect a wider potential industry insured loss range of $5 billion to $40 billion and raised their base case to $25 billion from $15 billion, with solvency capital at risk.\n\nThe analysts estimate about $70 billion of natural catastrophe losses for 2019 and added this could erode excess capital and raise prices.\n\nInsurers faced record bills from hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires of over $135 billion in 2017 and got some relief in 2018.\n\nUBS named Swiss Re (SRENH.S) as its least preferred stock and said its second buy-back was unlikely, with Lancashire (LRE.L), Beazley BEZG.L and SCOR (SCOR.PA) set to gain most from an uptick in prices.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian, which battered the Bahamas early on Monday, could cause insurance industry losses of up to $25 billion, according to analysts at UBS.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425413397&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF81112"}
