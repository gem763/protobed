In search of the just-firm-enough side sleeper pillow. Photo: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the estimated 70 percent of people who sleep on their sides, you\u2019re likely familiar with the toss-fluff-repeat cycle of a fitful rest. Unlike stomach and back sleepers, side sleepers need extra support, making it near impossible for basic pillows to get the job done. \u201cBecause of the greater distance between their heads and the mattress, side sleepers often need a thicker pillow to keep their head and neck in a neutral position,\u201d says Heather Turgeon, the author of The Happy Sleeper. As someone who\u2019s needed at least two pillows my entire life (lately a rigid Tempur-Pedic padded by a rotation of filling-challenged Ikea pillows), I\u2019ve consulted Turgeon for her august opinion on better side sleeper pillows. After testing each for a night \u2014 it\u2019s like One Thousand and One Nights around my apartment \u2014 I\u2019ve come away with a few favorites. Spoiler: Price has (in most cases) very little to do with what I ended up liking.\n\nMy absolute favorite\n\nThe runner-up\n\nTempur-Pedic Contour Side to Side Breeze $101 (was $169, now 40% off) A caveat up front: If you don\u2019t like the sensation of sleeping on a spongy piece of Styrofoam, you won\u2019t like this pillow. Maybe because I\u2019ve gotten used to my old Tempur-Pedic, but I really loved the hardness of the Side to Side Breeze, which is just like the regular Side to Side, only with a cooling gel layer for hot-headed sleepers (yes, please). Like Tempur-Pedic pillows you may be familiar with, this one features the brand\u2019s signature viscoelastic \u2014 which I\u2019m guessing means viscous and elastic \u2014 foam, but it wasn\u2019t sink-y the way Tempur-Pedic beds can be. There are different curves on the top and bottom of the Breeze, one that slopes more for higher neck support and one that slopes less for lower. The pillow feels expensive \u2014 sleeping on the higher-sloping side was like a cushy, luxe embrace. I\u2019m not a fan of regular Tempur-Pedic pillows because they\u2019re too squishy and the angles aren\u2019t right, but this one feels tailored for side sleepers. My only complaint is that it was a little too wide for the bed (even the queen size), and that, unless you\u2019re Blue Ivy or Larry Ellison, it\u2019s almost unjustifiably expensive. $101 at Amazon Buy $101 at Amazon Buy\n\nVery worth considering\n\nSnowe Down Alternative Pillow At first appraisal, the alternative down pillow from the direct-to-consumer houseware brand looked fluffier than I thought I would like, but once I rested my head on it, it settled to a nice thickness that \u201cheld.\u201d I\u2019ve found actually that for side sleepers who crave firmness, a polyester filling (like the kind that down alternative pillows use) generally outperforms real down \u2014 actual feathers tend to be too soft (pesky nature!) and don\u2019t lift and prop my head the way it really needs to be cradled. The Snowe regular down pillow had that problem for me; side by side, it was less billowy than the down alternative, and less supportive, too. $38 at Snowe Buy\n\nParachute Down Alternative Pillow (Firm) Off the bat (and as you can see in the photos), the loft on these pillows is insane \u2014 they\u2019re probably seven inches high just resting on your mattress. The pillows are filled with microfiber (which is a fancier way to describe a blend of polyester and various other man-made poly-prefixed materials) that didn\u2019t collapse the way that something like cotton or down would, but didn\u2019t provide the stiff support of the Wamsutta Extra Firm or Tempur-Contour either. Interestingly, the Parachute was one of the only pillows that didn\u2019t have a gusset \u2014 that two-to-three inch panel along the perimeter of the pillow that, according to Turgeon, creates extra height for side sleepers. I didn\u2019t notice a huge difference because of it (the Parachute was actually firmer than a few gusseted pillows), but that may be why the pillow seems almost overfilled. Much of that fill is air, though. Sleeping on it felt like sleeping on a solider, more permanently fluffed hotel pillow \u2014 nice, but not my, er, dream scenario. If you\u2019re in the market for a plush mattress topper, though, my colleague Lauren slept like a baby on Parachute\u2019s. $79 at Parachute Buy\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more options in the side-sleeper-pillow category, here are some highly reviewed options from Amazon, according to hyperenthusiastic sleepers.\n\nBest bamboo pillow\n\n\n\n\n\nCoop Home Goods Premium Adjustable Loft Pillow Not only is this the best-rated pillow on Amazon, it\u2019s also the best-rated bamboo pillow, according to reviewers. While it\u2019s great for sleepers of all preferences, side sleepers especially like it for how \u201csoft and supportive\u201d it is, with one reviewer writing that \u201cit was very comfortable and my neck stayed in correct alignment all night.\u201d Customers also appreciate that it\u2019s filled with shredded memory foam that can be adjusted (either taken out or added, depending on preference), with one saying that the pillow \u201cprovides perfect support for my neck and doesn\u2019t have the lumpy feel of cut up foam pieces, which makes for a much more comfortable sleeping experience.\u201d $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest gel pillow\n\n\n\n\n\nDreamNorth PREMIUM Gel Pillow Loft (Pack of 2) This gel-filled fiber pillow with over 2,600 five-star reviews \u201cprovides great comfort as it is not too hard or too soft,\u201d according to one side-sleeping reviewer who says it was \u201clike sleeping on a cloud.\u201d Others agree, with one saying that \u201cmy neck feels supported and I feel refreshed waking up,\u201d and another who writes that the pillows \u201cdon\u2019t \u2018smush\u2019 down while I sleep like other pillows, but are still soft enough to be comfortable.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest down alternative pillow\n\n\n\n\n\nSable Registered FDA Goose Down Alternative Bed Pillow (2 Pack) $37 (was $40, now 8% off) \u201cIt\u2019s softer than a standard down pillow but still firm enough for me, a side sleeper. They are perfectly fluffy and soft with not too much give,\u201d writes a reviewer. Other side sleepers agree, like this one who writes that it\u2019s \u201csoft, yet firm and supports my neck where I don\u2019t wake with a pain in my neck or have headaches anymore,\u201d and another who says that \u201cthese give me the support I need without compromising my shoulders.\u201d $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest cooling-memory-foam pillow\n\nThe Scrumptious Side Sleeper Pillow $100 (was $150, now 33% off) Filled with copper-infused foam, this cooling pillow features a slight curve designed to help maintain alignment while you sleep, as this reviewer attests: \u201cThe slight curve of the pillow makes it perfect to fit into me while I\u2019m sleeping. I\u2019ve never slept better.\u201d Another side sleeper agrees, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly comfortable. Not overfilled, but it doesn\u2019t go flat after a few hours of laying your head on it. I\u2019m comfortable all night, my neck and shoulders aren\u2019t sore when I wake up and I get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d $100 at Amazon Buy $100 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest contour pillow\n\n\n\n\n\nAERIS Contour Pillow,Premium Side Sleeper This contour pillow is a favorite among Amazon reviewers, one of whom writes that \u201cthis pillow has improved my comfort\u201d because \u201cit is firm enough to keep my head up on my side.\u201d Another says that they are \u201csleeping like a baby\u201d with this pillow, calling it the \u201cbest pillow I\u2019ve used, and I\u2019ve used a lot: down, foam, you name it. The contour is perfect for side sleeping,\u201d though they do warn that it\u2019s \u201cfairly hard.\u201d Another side sleeper calls sleeping on these pillows \u201ca dream,\u201d writing, \u201cMy head formed a shape to the pillow and it was so comfortable. The last few nights I have slept on it, I did not want to get up it is so comfortable.\u201d $43 at Amazon Buy $43 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest L-shaped pillow\n\nDMI U Shaped Contour Body Pillow Reviewers say that this polyester-filled L-shaped pillow is \u201cperfect for side sleepers.\u201d One side sleeper says that \u201cthe filling is a higher quality and it made the pillow soft enough to sink in, but firm enough to keep from sinking in too deeply.\u201d Another writes that it \u201cis just full/stuffed enough to keep my neck supported, and the shape allows my shoulder and arm to lay flat on the bed without being compressed.\u201d This reviewer agrees, too, saying that it \u201cshapes around my neck perfectly and leaves room for my crazy shoulder. It\u2019s like my very own little neck cocoon.\u201d $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest pillow for ear and neck pain\n\n\n\n\n\nPureComfort \u2013 Side Sleeping Pillow (Soft) If you\u2019re a side sleeper who also has ear sensitivity, you might want to consider this pillow with nearly 300 five-star reviews. \u201cIt has been a never-ending search for a pillow as a side sleeper until I found this alternative to the traditional pillow,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cThe contour of this pillow nestles my shoulder comfortably, and the ear holes provide added sleep comfort by preventing my head from sinking into the pillow.\u201d Others agree, with one saying that it\u2019s \u201cthe most comfortable pillow I have ever used,\u201d explaining that \u201cit supports my neck, relieving pressure on my cervical spine.\u201d Another writes that \u201csince I have been using the PureComfort pillow, the ear pain has vanished.\u201d As this reviewer concludes, \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect firmness.
