(She called it \u201cYou-Know-Who vs. China: Facing America\u2019s Greatest Threat.\u201d)\n\nGoldberg began the conversation with Trump\u2019s latest tweet on impeachment. Instead of calling it a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d the president is now referring to the official inquiry as a \u201clynching.\u201d As the audience groaned, Goldberg shook her head and said, \u201cIt's a word that nobody, you know, wants to hear. This was not a good choice of words for him, do you think?\u201d\n\nWithout missing a beat, Gingrich replied, \u201cWell, it's exactly the same term that Clarance Thomas used when he said he was guilty of a white-collar lynching.\u201d No one bothered to correct him that the Supreme Court justice actually used the term \u201chigh-tech lynching\u201d to describe the sexual harassment allegations leveled against him by Anita Hill during his confirmation hearings.\n\nAsked by Goldberg if it was \u201cright then,\u201d Gingrich said, \u201cI think it was right, sure.\u201d Then he urged the co-hosts to \u201cput yourself for a second in Trump\u2019s shoes,\u201d painting the president as an upstanding do-gooder who just can\u2019t catch a break. \u201cI think part of what you have is a guy here who's just really deeply frustrated that no matter where he turns, you know, the fight keeps going on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conversation drifted away from the \u201clynching\u201d comment for a few moments, but then Goldberg brought it back. \u201cListen, Newt, you and I have known each other a long time,\u201d she said, \u201cand when a giant six-foot white guy says I'm being lynched here, you understand why it's a little bit like, listen man, you're not being lynched here, you are being held to the standard we\u2019re supposed to be holding every president to.\u201d\n\nIn response, Gingrich announced that he was going to be \u201cvery politically incorrect\u201d before arguing that \u201cmost of the early American movies on lynching were about lynching white people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, it may not be a totally black experience,\u201d Goldberg allowed, \u201cbut we're kind of the only folks that didn't come out from under the experience that was put on us, as you well know.\u201d\n\nAfter some further pressing, Gingrich ultimately admitted that he did not actually think it was appropriate for Trump to use the word \u201clynching\u201d but was instead reflexively defending his team. \u201cNo, look, I've been comfortable just calling it a witch hunt and a kangaroo court and things like that, I haven't gone up to that next level.\u201d", "description": "The former Republican House Speaker co-hosted \u201cThe View\u201d on Tuesday.
