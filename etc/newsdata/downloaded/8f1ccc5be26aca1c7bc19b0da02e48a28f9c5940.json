The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the Short-Term IDR at 'F1' and removed it from Under Criteria Observation. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed the Viability Rating at 'bbb'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.The rating actions on the IDRs follow similar affirmations taken on its parent, Standard Chartered Bank (SCB: A+/Stable/a), and its ultimate parent, Standard Chartered PLC (A/Stable/a), on 2 September 2019.

The ratings mainly consider SCBK's role as a key part of SCB's international transaction banking operation within export-oriented South Korea, in which corporate trade volumes are substantial. SCBK is the parent's third-largest operation in Asia following Hong Kong and Singapore, accounting for about 8% of Standard Chartered PLC's consolidated assets at end-2018.Fitch believes SCBK's default on its obligations would have a huge impact on the reputation of SCB, which fully owns SCBK through the interim holding company Standard Chartered NEA Limited. The parent has consistently demonstrated commitment to its Korean subsidiary since the acquisition in 2006 even though SCBK has faced challenges to compete effectively with major local banks as a foreign-owned and medium-sized player. The Long-Term IDR is equalised with the Viability Rating of SCB. The use of SCB's Viability Rating as the anchor rating reflects Fitch's view that there is significant uncertainty whether SCBK would benefit from SCB's significant junior debt buffer, which uplifts the parent's Long-Term IDRs by one notch from the Viability Rating. The Stable Outlook on SCBK's Long-Term IDR mirrors that on SCB and reflects Fitch's expectation that SCB's credit profile would remain steady in the near term.The Short-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'F1'. It is the lower of two possible choices at the 'A' Long-Term IDR level but is the same as that of its parent SCB, reflecting the potential for extraordinary support if needed. VIABILITY RATINGSCBK's 'bbb' Viability Rating mainly reflects its below-local-peer profitability and less stable business model than local peers, in part due to weak profitability from its retail banking operation. These are countered by strong ordinary support from SCB, especially in geographically diversified corporate networks, risk management and foreign-currency funding, which have allowed SCBK to maintain sound asset quality, and broadly stable capitalisation and funding. SCBK's operating income/risk-weighted assets has stabilised at around a low 1% from 2017, but has lagged the local commercial bank average over the past decade due to its high cost structure. Low profits from the retail banking operation results in a significant reliance on its foreign-currency and transaction-banking operations, which can be susceptible to capital market dislocation. Fitch believes management will find it challenging to achieve its target of return on equity of 10% by 2022 (versus 7% in 1H19) because of the Korean banking sector's intense competition, tight local regulation and the bank's limited pricing power. Fitch expects SCBK to maintain solid capital buffers over the regulatory minimums in the next two years, supported by modest asset growth and the parent's ordinary support. The bank's Fitch Core Capital ratio fell to 13.5% by end-1H19 from 16.1% at end-2018 mainly due to significant dividend payments of KRW612 billion in 1Q19. The large dividends were followed by SCB's non-core capital injection of KRW600 billion in January 2019 via the acquisition of SCBK's Tier 2 capital instrument, which does not have a feature to absorb losses prior to SCBK becoming insolvent.The loans-to-customer-deposits ratio (119% at end-2018; adjusted for loans and deposits to and from financial institutions) is likely to remain broadly steady in the next two years, in light of its modest appetite for asset growth and low interest rates in Korea. SCB and its affiliates provide a significant portion of SCBK's foreign-currency funding to support the latter's relatively sizeable foreign-currency and transaction-banking operations.Local authorities' accommodative policy measures and a broadly steady local property market over the next two years will help SCBK maintain a modest impaired loan ratio (0.7% at end-1H19), although Fitch forecasts Korea's GDP growth to soften to 2% in 2019 and 2.3% in 2020 from 2.7% in 2018 due to sluggish exports. The bank's high loan concentration in residential mortgages (48% of loans at end-1H19) is mitigated by the large proportion of prime-quality borrowers and modest loan-to-value ratio of about 40% on average, based on our estimate, at end-2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SUPPORT RATINGAny change in SCB's Viability Rating is likely to lead to a similar rating action on SCBK's ratings. Moreover, any material change in our assumptions around the parent's ability or propensity to extend support would prompt a ratings review. For example, negative rating action could be prompted by a reduction in Fitch's assessment of SCBK's importance to SCB's strategy. SCBK's IDRs could be upgraded and equalised with its parent's IDRs if there is tangible evidence suggesting that the subsidiary's senior creditors would benefit from the parent's junior debt buffers. For instance, the parent's pre-positioning or specific allotment of large qualifying junior debt to SCBK could prompt an upgrade.VIABILITY RATINGThe bank's Viability Rating is primarily sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions regarding SCBK's profitability, company profile and capitalisation.Fitch may upgrade the Viability Rating if SCBK noticeably improves its underlying profitability and overall stability of business model closer to that of higher-rated local peers without a material deterioration in capitalisation or risk appetite. Conversely, downward pressure in the Viability Rating could arise from a material increase in the bank's risk appetite, if it leads to a noticeable deterioration in asset quality or capitalisation. Noticeable erosion in its capital buffers, either due to an unexpected external shock or an excessive dividend payout, could also result in a downgrade. The probability of either happening in the next two years is low, in our view. Public Ratings with Credit Linkage to other ratings SCBK's Long-Term IDR is directly linked to SCB's Viability Rating.
