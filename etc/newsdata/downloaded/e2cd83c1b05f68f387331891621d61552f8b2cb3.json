Three percent of Democrats surveyed by Quinnipiac said they support Mr. Yang\u2019s candidacy, effectively placing him in the poll behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden (32%); Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat (19%); Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent (15%); Sen. Kamala Harris, California Democrat (7%); and Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana (5%).\n\nCNN aired a graphic of six leading Democratic candidates while reporting on the poll but left out Mr. Yang. The image showed the top five contenders, per Quinnipiac\u2019s latest polling, followed by Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman for Texas who placed lower in the survey due to receiving the support of only 1% of respondents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never been a politician before, but the treatment of our rising national poll results has been odd and confusing,\u201d Mr. Yang said in the campaign email.\n\n\u201cThe trend of this campaign is already very positive \u2014 think where we could be if we received the same level of coverage as folks like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden,\u201d Mr. Yang said.\n\nA spokesperson for CNN did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nRandy Jones, Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign spokesman, told Business Insider on Thursday that the network has apologized and said it would no longer use the image, the website reported.\n\n\u201cWhen the inexcusable graphics were brought to our attention we immediately reached out to CNN. They responded quickly, pledged to remove the incorrect graphics and offered a sincere apology. We have had a productive working relationship with the network thus far and expect that to continue,\u201d Mr. Jones said in a statement, the outlet reported.\n\nMr. Yang, 44, and nine other presidential hopefuls are set to participate in the next two debates organized by the Democratic National Committee after meeting a Wednesday deadline to satisfy requirements set by the DNC. Candidates needed to receive contributions from 130,000 individual donors and poll at or above 2% percent in four DNC-approved polls to reserve a spot in the next debates.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
