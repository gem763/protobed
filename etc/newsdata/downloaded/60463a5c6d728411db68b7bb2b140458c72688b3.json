Did you cut off your friends and family or sacrifice your mental health?\"\n\n\"Make time for what matters,\" he added. \"Take care of yourself. Mind, Body, and Spirit. #NoExcuses.\"\n\nBurke also shared a post that raised eyebrows... a photo of herself in her trailer, looking into the distance. \"Hair courtesy of @kelseygusto, glam courtesy of @crabichuk, deep thought courtesy of the upcoming live show. #DWTS,\" she captioned it.\n\nThe news comes a week after Lewis and Burke found themselves in danger of elimination. After being announced as one of the two bottom couples, the dancing duo was saved by the judges, who sent Mary Wilson and pro Brandon Armstrong home.\n\n\"I think I peed myself just a little bit,\" Burke joked at the time. \"I've always wanted to see what happens if I did that on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"You know how it's never really the bottom two and it's, like, so wishy-washy? Now it is what it is and the judges are gonna choose,\" she added of the new judges' save. \"Hopefully the audience is either/or. You need to get the audience on your side so you're not in the bottom two or the judges. And the dancing, the quality's gotta come up a level.\"\n\nLewis said he's had plenty of \"terrible games\" when he was playing professional football, but said his time in the ballroom last week wasn't \"a bad day\" whatsoever.\n\n\"Look, I'm confident in my partner, man!\" he exclaimed. \"It's how you can get back up, go back in the gym and go back to work.\"\n\nHear more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nLeah Remini Returning to 'Dancing With the Stars' as Guest Judge\n\nCharlie Sheen Says He Was Almost on Season 28 of 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\n'Dancing With the Stars': A Complete Guide to the New Ballroom Rules\n\n'DWTS': Mary Wilson and Brandon Armstrong React to Being First Eliminated Couple (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "A source tells ET the former NFL star sustained an injury.", "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9Ow17lJBjT9EJENrNICtsg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/95a0cc54e7d393d2e0d70215a4a85062", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
