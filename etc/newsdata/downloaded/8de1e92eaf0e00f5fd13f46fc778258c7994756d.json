Pokphand Co (0043.HK), one of China\u2019s top five pig producers, is speeding up expansion of its business, said the company\u2019s chief executive, after a year-long outbreak of disease devastated an industry worth $140 billion (112.6 billion pounds)last year.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An employee works on a production line at a pork processing factory of Beijing Resource Group on the outskirts of Beijing July 19, 2011. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe company, part of Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, plans to raise 10 million pigs a year by 2021, up from 4 million currently, Bai Shanlin told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThat comes after an epidemic of African swine fever broke out in China in mid-2018, decimating the world\u2019s largest hog herd and reducing its breeding population by 37% since the first cases were discovered, according to official data.\n\nThe virus infected several of C.P\u2019s farms, with some of its smaller, older farms susceptible to the virus because they did not have adequate biosecurity, such as truck washing facilities, or were located in areas ravaged by the disease, said Bai.\n\nBai\u2019s comments were a rare admission by a listed farming company in China that the virus has entered its herds.\n\nThe company, which started out as a feed supplier in China, moved into pig production about 10 years ago after an outbreak of a disease known as \u201cblue ear\u201d.\n\nBlue ear hit China\u2019s pig herd hard and sent a strong signal that China\u2019s traditional farms need to be replaced by intensive systems, Bai said.\n\nC.P. is China\u2019s fourth- or fifth-largest producer but accounts for only a tiny share of the 700 million pigs slaughtered every year.\n\nMore than 90% of China\u2019s farms still need to be upgraded, Bai believes.\n\nC.P. lost \u201cless than 10%\u201d of its sows to African swine fever, leaving it with 250,000 productive sows, he said.\n\nThe infected farms will be repopulated soon, starting with a farm in Shenyang in northeast Liaoning next month, followed by another in Dongying in northern Shandong province, he said.\n\nBoth of the farms previously had 2,400 breeding sows.\n\nRepopulating infected farms is a hot topic in the industry, with Beijing urging producers to rebuild their herds as pork prices soar on a shortage of supplies.\n\nBut putting pigs back into farms touched by the disease is \u201ca risky investment\u201d, Bai said.\n\nAfrican swine fever, which spreads through blood, faeces, and other fluids, can last for months on farm surfaces or equipment that has not been properly cleaned.\n\nDespite now being endemic in the country, the virus can be prevented, and could be less risky than some airborne diseases such as Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus that are more contagious, said Bai.\n\nLosses of only 4% among 200 sow farmers that breed pigs for C.P. under contract prove the disease is preventable, he said.\n\nThat is important, given that a vaccine against the disease could still be years away.\n\nC.P. has been approached by government researchers to participate in tests of a vaccine prototype, but it is reluctant to join in until there is more evidence, said Bai.\n\nThe company has already secured the land and budget to feed, raise and slaughter another 6 million pigs a year, he said.\n\n\u201cWe build our own sow units, finisher units, dedicated transport and slaughter systems, and include crop land,\u201d he said, giving the company oversight of the whole supply chain to counter the continued threat of African swine fever.\n\nThe company operates three large slaughterhouses and is building three more. It is leasing space in other facilities as well, Bai said, to lift its slaughter rate from just half of its pigs currently.\n\n\u201cWe have been transforming the system but this disease has really pushed us to move faster,\u201d he said.\n\nInteractive graphic: China's pig industry crisis: here", "description": "C.P.
