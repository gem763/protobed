They (security forces) fired tear gas, rubber and live bullets and there were injuries,\u201d a man who took part in the demonstration but declined to be named told AFP.\n\nAnother resident, who also preferred to remain anonymous, said the tear gas was so thick it had reached her apartment block a few kilometres away from the turbulent downtown area.\n\nHassan Hassan (@hxhassan) A demonstration in #Suez against El-Sisi. pic.twitter.com/uUy7TBLZGc\n\n\u201cMy nose started burning up. The smell was seeping through the balcony. I also saw some youth run and hide in our street\u201d, the woman said.\n\nOn late Friday, hundreds of Egyptians poured through the streets of Cairo, chanting slogans including \u201cLeave, Sisi!\u201d and demanding the \u201cfall of the regime\u201d.\n\nAt least 74 people were arrested after clashes between the crowds and police in the capital, a security source told AFP.\n\nThe protests came after Mohamed Aly, an exiled businessman and opponent of Sisi posted calls online for demonstrations.\n\nHe upped the pressure on Saturday in an expletive-filled video, imploring Egyptians to join a \u201cmillion-man march\u201d next Friday and to fill all \u201cmajor squares\u201d of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a people\u2019s revolution...
