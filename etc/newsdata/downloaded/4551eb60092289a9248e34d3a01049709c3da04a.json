Apple's new iPhone 11 goes on sale today at the grand re-opening of the 5th Avenue store.\n\nShares of Apple jumped as much as 1.7% in early trading on Friday after the Nikkei Asian Review reported the company is increasing production of the iPhone 11 models by as much as 10%.\n\nThe surge in production is being driven by better-than-expected demand for the new handsets, Nikkei reported, citing sources close to the situation. Apple bumped up orders for the $699 iPhone 11 and the $999 iPhone 11 Pro, while the company is cutting back on orders for the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which starts at $1,099.\n\nSuppliers said demand is strong \"for now,\" but warned that the surge might not last, the Nikkei said.\n\nIn a note to clients on Friday, Deutsche Bank analysts said they couldn't confirm the Nikkei report, but they continue to see upside to current iPhone unit sales. The analysts said there's also a strong chance that Apple could report year-over-year growth in iPhone revenues \"if the report proves to be true.\"\n\nIt comes as Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with German newspaper Bild that iPhone 11 sales appear to be off to a \"very strong start.\" While he didn't share any specific sales figures, Cook said he \"could not be happier\" with the iPhone 11 launch.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts also voiced optimism about sales of the new iPhones. In a note on Monday, J.P. Morgan projected Apple could sell 1 million more iPhones than it previously expected in the current quarter.", "description": "The Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple has asked suppliers to increase production of its iPhone 11 models, sending AAPL shares up more than 2%", "authors": ["Annie Palmer"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106140832-1568985934997gettyimages-1169791638.jpg?v=1568986008", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
