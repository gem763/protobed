It was tough for us, but we corrected what needed to be corrected,\u201d Spain coach Robert Moreno told reporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that have achieved this, there\u2019s a lot less pressure and now in three weeks we play Malta. We must focus on playing well in the remaining matches,\u201d he added.\n\nSweden coach Janne Andersson said he was happy with his players, despite them conceding a late goal.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s football, it happens sometimes. I can\u2019t sit here and be annoyed with players who have given everything,\u201d he told a reporters.\n\nElsewhere in the group, the Faroe Islands secured their first win of the campaign with a 1-0 home win over Malta, while Romania drew 1-1 at home to Norway.\n\nThe battle to join Spain at Euro 2020 could be decided when Sweden visit Romania on Nov. 15. Norway, who are fourth in the group on 11 points, still retain a remote chance of making the tournament.", "description": "A stuttering Spain qualified for Euro 2020 as a stoppage-time strike by substitute Rodrigo cancelled out Marcus Berg's opener for Sweden in a 1-1 draw in Group F on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Philip O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441241974&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1W4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
