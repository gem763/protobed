Some carried babies and small children; others clutched small bags of possessions snatched hastily from the rubble of their ruined homes; most had just the clothes they stood in.\n\nFor the 1,435 weary Hurricane Dorian evacuees from the Bahamas who disembarked the Grand Celebration liner and stepped on to the dockside at the weekend there were the pressing concerns of where they would find immediate shelter.\n\nBut while the Red Cross spoke of how they had received offers from across Florida to help accommodate them, their longer-term situations, and the willingness of the US to offer shelter to more of the tens of thousands of homeless survivors have quickly became politically sensitive questions.\n\nHow you can help Hurricane Dorian disaster relief Read more\n\nOn Monday, Donald Trump weighed in, claiming without evidence that \u201cvery bad people\u201d including gang members and drug dealers were probably among evacuees seeking entry to the US.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments also followed an episode on Sunday in Freeport, the capital of the island of Grand Bahama that was torn apart by the category 5 hurricane just days earlier, in which dozens of Bahamians without US visas were ordered off a boat to Fort Lauderdale even though they were admissible on humanitarian grounds without one.\n\nThe majority of those newly arrived from Freeport on Saturday to the Port of Palm Beach on the cruise liner slipped quietly away, collected by family members already in Florida, or to hotels or private accommodation that friends, relatives and benefactors had secured for them.\n\nOf the 857 Bahamian nationals aboard, barely 60 got on buses for a Red Cross shelter set up at a recreation center in nearby Lake Worth on Saturday.\n\nRed Cross officials spoke of how they were focused on their immediate needs.\n\n\u201cThe county asked us to open the shelter temporarily for the people who are coming on this ship, but there is no rolling process, no ongoing process for additional people to be processed this way,\u201d Craig Cooper, national spokesman for the American Red Cross, told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to dispel any belief or assumption there is going to be an ongoing situation or absorbing people who are coming over from the Bahamas.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not looking for handouts\u2019\n\nThe humanitarian evacuation to Florida so far has involved just a few thousand of the estimated 70,000 islanders made homeless by the most powerful storm ever to strike the Bahamas.\n\nThose who have made it to Florida, however, have little time for politics.\n\nSome, like Areesha Marshall, 24, have more important concerns as they start to think about how to reconstruct their lives, such as caring for her three- and four-year-old children in a new country. \u201cNo one really knows when it\u2019s going to be OK to go back home,\u201d she told the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cThe situation is dire.\u201d\n\nCooper, of the Red Cross, said the common theme among those at the shelter was a desire to rebuild. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for handouts,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost the first thing out of many of these people\u2019s mouths was, \u2018I need to get to work, I need to find a way to find a job here in the US. My family needs the money, I need the money, I don\u2019t want to sit in the shelter.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmazing response\n\nHe pointed to \u201cthe amazing response\u201d to the crisis by the residents of Florida, itself still recovering from two major hurricane strikes in two years, Irma in 2017 and Michael last year.\n\n\u201cWe had a call from someone in Jacksonville, a property owner with 150 available places for people to stay, and other calls, individual homeowners who say they\u2019re not going to be in their house for the next three months, that type of thing,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nSupport for the evacuees, who have arrived in Florida every day since the hurricane on relief flights, and on an armada of smaller private boats whose captains ferry supplies in and take victims out, has come from many quarters.\n\nFor example, the Mastroianni Foundation, established by a family of prominent south Florida hoteliers, has provided rooms for dozens of displaced Bahamians in two hotels in Jupiter. \u201cThese people have been through the absolute worst days of their lives and have lost everything,\u201d chief executive Nick Mastroianni said in a Facebook post. \u201cThey will have a place to rest their head until they get their feet on the ground.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian relief and support sites have also popped up on social media, with Floridians posting offers of accommodation in private houses or on Airbnb.\n\nStrong bonds\n\nMostly, however, those who have arrived in Florida from the Bahamas have joined family members already living here, proof of the strong bonds and history between the Sunshine State and the Caribbean island nation. An estimated 20,000 Bahamians live in Miami and its suburbs.\n\n\u201cBahamians practically helped build Miami and Broward county back in the 1930s and 40s, so they have a deep connection,\u201d said Shevrin Jones, a Democratic state congressman of Bahamian descent.\n\n\u201cOutside of just being a vacation spot, Florida is a place where the Bahamian community migrated years ago for a better life for their families. They found that and now they call Florida their home. They\u2019re now looking for Florida to help build the Bahamas.\u201d\n\nJones has been lobbying the Trump administration to waive visa requirements and open an easier path to admission for hurricane refugees. \u201cI\u2019m almost sure if we would do our research the amount of people who would want to come here is not as many as probably going through the mind of so many,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamian people do not want to come to Florida to stay, it\u2019s like your nextdoor neighbor helping you after an ordeal with a place to sleep for a while. I\u2019ll keep saying it until I\u2019m blue in the face, this is a humanitarian effort and we have to think about if it was us, what would we want?\u201d", "description": "Thousands forced to flee their homes by Hurricane Dorian found refuge in the Sunshine State but Trump has cast aspersions", "authors": ["Richard Luscombe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78c6990008f40aabd71767b38dd51f8f548f1f0d/0_36_5661_3397/master/5661.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc209df47b8ff034c9e9a8cdfff7f671", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
