It also contained a brief but memorable moment of comedy: A shot of a traveler to the moon contemplating the lengthy instructions on how to use a \"zero gravity toilet.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to Elvis, or at least to Graceland, where visitors for the next three months will encounter an unusual photo op: a replica zero gravity space toilet.\n\n\"Visitors can sit on the toilet in this full-size mockup,\" a brochure for Graceland's \"Journey to Space\" exhibit states. \"On a near-by video, astronauts explain the ins and outs of answering the call of nature in space.\" The mockup comes complete with \"urine funnel\" and \"thigh holders\" that in space keep the user from floating off the seat, like the fold-down security bars on a roller coaster.\n\n\"Journey to Space,\" which opens Friday, is the latest large-scale show to occupy one of the 10,000-square-foot exhibit spaces in the 80,000-square-foot Graceland Exhibition Center, the most recent addition to a Graceland campus that increasingly is diversifying its attractions to reach beyond the Elvis fan base.\n\nCLOSE A meteorite. A Neil Armstrong helmet. A replica zero gravity space toilet. New Graceland exhibit lets visitors \"Journey to Space.\" Memphis Commercial Appeal\n\nOrganized by the Science Museum of Minnesota, the exhibit \u2014 like a space capsule \u2014 packs a great deal of science, technology, hands-on activities and artifacts (including a Neil Armstrong helmet and pair of gloves) into the amount of room available.\n\nVisitors can activate experiments that demonstrate the effects of weightlessness. They can fit their hands into pressurized gloves. They can manipulate a robot arm, and marvel at a genuine meteorite.\n\nThe centerpiece is a pair of full-size walk-in replicas of the U.S Destiny lab aboard the International Space Station. The lab rotates around its central walkway, in an approximation of the effect of weightlessness that can leave a visitor dizzy.\n\nEven amid such marvels, \"The basic question everybody asks is, 'What's it like to go to the bathroom in space?'\" said Christian Ross, Graceland public relations specialist, who admitted that the subject is not irrelevant to an exhibition devoted to exploring \"what's it like to live and work and travel in space.\"\n\nThe exhibition also asks: What's it like to die in space? \"Space Can Kill You\" is the theme of one section of the show, which examines the deadly perils of an environment with no air, high levels of radiation and bullet-swift meteoroids.\n\nLocated across the street from the Elvis Presley mansion, just behind the Elvis Presley's Memphis complex of shops, restaurants and museums, the $20 million Graceland Exhibition Center opened in May, with a Jungle Room Bar in the lobby and exhibits devoted to \"Muhammad Ali: Greatest of All Time,\" \"A Century of the American Motorcycle\" and \"National Geographic: Earth Explorers\" occupying most of the rest of its large, rectangular, warehouse-like dimensions.\n\nArchivists Dewana Oliver and Brian Johnson set up the full-size walk-in replica of the U.S Destiny lab aboard the International Space Station. The labs will be the centerpiece in Graceland's 10,000-square-foot space exhibit \"Journey to Space.\" (Photo: Ariel Cobbert, The Commercial Appeal )\n\nThe first exhibitions have now run their course. \"Journey to Space\" begins a second wave of shows; the next to arrive will be \"Expedition: Dinosaur,\" which opens Oct. 25 with a display of animatronic prehistoric animals and such activities as a paleontological \"dig site.\"\n\nWhat's conspicuously missing from this picture? Elvis.\n\nRoss said about 600,000 people visit Graceland annually; the center provides an incentive for them to make a repeat trip to Memphis.\n\nGraceland's 10,000-square-foot space exhibit \"Journey to Space\" features artifacts including Neil Armstrong helmet and pair of gloves. (Photo: Ariel Cobbert, The Commercial Appeal )\n\n\"Journey to Space\" is one of six current traveling shows organized by St. Paul's Science Museum of Minnesota, which \u2014 like such other prominent institutions as the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago \u2014 has developed a thriving business in designing and installing touring exhibitions that are both entertaining and educational.\n\nTravis Dickinson, manager of traveling exhibits for the Science Museum, said eight 53-foot-long tractor-trailer rigs were required to tote the contents of \"Journey to Space\" to Graceland. Dickinson and two other Science Museum employees are in Memphis this week, to make sure every ion engine and outer-space compression suit is in place.\n\nWith diplomatic understatement, Dickinson said he was \"surprised\" when he saw that \"Journey to Space\" was traveling to Graceland, a place where the jumpsuits are notable for their rhinestones rather than their life-support systems. He said the exhibition more typically finds itself at such locations as Space Center Houston, the visitor center of NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\n'Journey to Space: An Unparalleled Adventure of Space Exploration'\n\nOct. 11-Jan. 5, Graceland Exhibition Center.\n\nAdmission: $16 (adults); $14.40 (ages 62 and older); $8 (ages 13-17); $5 (ages 3-12). Group rates and ticket packages with other Graceland locations available.\n\nCall 901-332-3322 or visit graceland.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/10/graceland-elvis-presley-exhibit-hall-journey-to-space/3939020002/", "description": "A meteorite.
