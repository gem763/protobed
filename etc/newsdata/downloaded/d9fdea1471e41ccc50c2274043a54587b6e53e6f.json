Golfers also will play from sunup until sundown Sunday, getting in as many holes as possible before finishing the tournament Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe did this at Congressional one year,\u201d Woods told reporters, referring to playing in front of empty galleries, \u201cand it was a ghost town. This was a little bit different. When you make a putt and you kind of put your hand up, you\u2019re like, \u2018Hmm, don\u2019t really need to put your hand up because there\u2019s no one clapping.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2012 for the third round of the AT&T National at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, officials barred spectators from attending the now-defunct regular PGA Tour stop in the D.C. area after a powerful storm called a derecho ripped through the nation\u2019s capital and its suburbs.\n\nOn Saturday, Woods birdied five of nine inward holes in his first tournament since undergoing left knee surgery. He\u2019s making his tour debut for the 2019-20 season after participating in a Skins event Monday, and will be in the final group with Woodland and Hideki Matsuyama for the closing 36 holes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWoods and Woodland had shared the first-round lead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that I\u2019ve been able to score as well as I have,\u201d Woods said. \u201cUsually that takes a little bit of time, but this golf course is a little bit on the softer side. I\u2019ve been able to strike my irons pretty well this week so far, and that\u2019s been nice.\u201d\n\nWoods\u2019s 16 birdies, including two in a row to finish the second round, lead the tournament that features an all-star field, with the likes of Rory McIlory, Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas.\n\nIn his pursuit of matching Sam Snead\u2019s record for career PGA Tour victories, Woods made birdies of 15 feet on the 11th hole and from 10 feet at No. 13. His 25-footer for birdie dropped at the seventh, and he had a tap-in for birdie to start his second round.\n\nAD\n\nWoods added another birdie at the 10th, shortened to a 140-yard par-4 because of standing water on the regular tee box.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good about it today,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI hit the ball a little better than I did yesterday, which is nice, and I had the speed of the greens again. The greens are soft. They\u2019re a little bit slower today, and we could give it a little bit extra rap on it.\u201d\n\nThe third round is scheduled to begin at 6:30 a.m. local time Sunday, and players will not be re-paired, regardless of their positioning on the leader board entering the final round. There is expected to be a break of approximately 20 minutes between the end of the third round and the start of the fourth.\n\nAD\n\nWood has the additional task of considering which players he may select to join the U.S. Presidents Cup team, for which he is serving as captain. There are four captain\u2019s selections in addition to the automatic qualifiers, and Woodland\u2019s performance in part has elevated the reigning U.S. Open champion into the conversation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a grind all day,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cI had some opportunities to post a pretty good number, but all in all, I\u2019m happy to not have my best stuff and shoot 4 under.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "With spectators barred for safety reasons, 15-time major champion fires a second-straight round of 6-under-par 64 in his quest to match PGA Tour record for career wins.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E2np0y94wK2ACPbMncYQFFTidbI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HFEXT3XX4YI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
