And for nearly five months, investors haven\u2019t blinked.\n\nFear of a looming recession could change all that. But for now, expect more of the same when the four companies under scrutiny report their quarterly results over the next two weeks.\n\nShares of the principal targets \u2014 Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +1.12% GOOG, +1.07% Google, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.05% , Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.14% and Facebook Inc. FB, +1.54% \u2014 have improved since early June, when news leaked of separate Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission probes into their business practices.\n\nRead more: Feds target four of the biggest tech companies in U.S., and their stocks are getting slammed\n\nEach companies\u2019 stock gains \u2014 Alphabet (up 17% through Monday\u2019s close), Amazon (flat), Apple (up 39%), and Facebook (up 13%) \u2014 belie a doomsday narrative of tech behemoths being split up or spun off, as the companies continue to rack up record revenue. Wall Street analysts\u2019 sentiment is best summed up by Wedbush Securities\u2019 Daniel Ives, who looks upon the government threat as nothing more than a series of fines that will lead to modest business reforms at the Big Four.\n\nMakan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, told MarketWatch on Tuesday it is uncertain what actions, if any, will be taken against Big Tech.\n\n\u201cWe just want to serve the consumer in a tech world,\u201d he said in a one-on-one interview on the sidelines of the WSJ Tech Live conference in Southern California.\n\nWhat Big Tech has to say is anyone\u2019s guess because the companies have stayed relatively silent on the topic. Indeed, finding references to anti-competitive investigations in company filings can be like panning for gold even as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet face a Oct. 21 deadline to reply to House investigators\u2019 requests for information about their business practices.\n\nThe antitrust suspects: Facebook and Apple appear to be most at risk\n\nIf anything, events of the past week underscore where investors place their true priority. When the Trump administration inched toward an interim trade deal with China, forestalling a tariff increase scheduled for this week, tech stocks soared.\n\nHere is what the companies are saying about the investigations, as well as what is expected when they report calendar third-quarter results in the days ahead.\n\nAmazon (reports Oct. 24)\n\nE-commerce sales. Amazon Prime subscribers. Amazon Web Services. It\u2019s all clicking for Amazon.\n\nAnalysts on average expect Amazon to report earnings of nearly $2.3 billion on revenue of $68.8 billion during its third quarter, according to FactSet. And that does not include the anticipated award of a $10 billion cloud-computing contract from the Pentagon.\n\nFull earnings preview: One-day shipping and AWS slowdown could squeeze Amazon results\n\n\u201cWe are still big believers in Amazon\u2019s long-term prospects, as faster growth at higher-margin businesses (AWS, Advertising) drives profit upside in forward years,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in an Oct. 15 research note.\n\nAWS, in particular, has been a catalyst. It is projected to haul in $35.27 billion this year, up 37% from $25.66 billion in 2018. AWS would account for 13% of all revenue, compared with 11% a year earlier. Thill rates Amazon stock as Buy, with a price target of $2,300.\n\nThe global public cloud services market is projected to grow to $221.6 billion in 2019 and reach $344.9 billion by 2022, according to market researcher Gartner. The fastest-growing segment, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), is expected to reach $74.1 billion by 2022. AWS is the largest IaaS provider, accounting for 48% of the market in 2018, Gartner analyst Sid Nag told MarketWatch.\n\nSome 47 analysts polled by FactSet have a consensus price target of $2,289.46, which represents a 32% upside to Amazon\u2019s closing price of $1,736.43 on Monday.\n\nAs for the impact of a far-reaching regulatory investigation? Amazon has been mum in filings and executives\u2019 public statements about any inquiries.\n\nAlphabet (Oct. 28)\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Google has been notoriously stingy with financial details even when reporting earnings, so its relative silence on antitrust issues isn\u2019t surprising.\n\nAlphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat in July did share that sales for cloud and YouTube during the previous quarter were particularly strong, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai disclosed the company\u2019s cloud division reached an annual run rate of over $8 billion, the first financial update on Google Cloud since February 2018. (Google\u2019s advertising, driven by mobile search and YouTube, rose 16% to $32.6 billion, though Porat warned Google expected foreign-exchange headwinds in the third quarter.)\n\nPichai briefly addressed the \u201cR\u201d word when pressed on the regulatory climate during a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe understand there will be scrutiny,\u201d Pichai said. Questions about competition and copyright protection is \u201cnot new to us,\u201d he added. The company did not disclose any investigation in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission after last quarter\u2019s report.\n\nGovernment probe or not, Google is well positioned in the second half of 2019 because of \u201chealthy core advertising (innovating around YouTube and Maps, incl. for travel and local), momentum in Google Cloud, and expanded hardware line-up ahead of holidays,\u201d Thill said in a research note on Oct. 15. He gives the stock at Buy rating and price target of $1,500.\n\nGoogle Cloud can compound revenue at 55% between 2018 and 2022, reaching $17 billion, concluded Deutsche Bank in an Oct. 2 note. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley raised his price target to $1,600 from $1,475.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet expect earnings of $12.31 per share on revenue of $40.3 billion in Alphabet\u2019s third quarter.\n\nFacebook (Oct. 30)\n\nTo date, Facebook has been the only member of tech\u2019s Big Four to disclose in a company filing that it is under federal investigation.\n\n\u201cThe online technology industry and our company have received increased regulatory scrutiny in the past quarter,\u201d Facebook said in its second-quarter earnings release after the market closed July 24. \u201cIn June 2019, we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. In addition, in July 2019, the Department of Justice announced that it will begin an antitrust review of market-leading online platforms.\u201d\n\nRead more: Facebook earnings include admission of two antitrust probes and billions in fines, but stock barely hurt\n\nNone of it seems to faze Facebook investors. The social-networking leviathan has been the poster child for tech\u2019s Teflon-like immunity to federal investigations. Last week, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies, began running a text ad on Facebook blasting Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook\u2019s chief executive, it said, has \u201cgiven Donald Trump free rein to lie\u201d on Facebook.\n\nDespite a series of embarrassing disclosures around how it collects and handles data, prompting another scheduled appearance before Congress by Zuckerberg on Wednesday, it continues to rack up healthy revenue and membership numbers. Analysts polled by FactSet anticipate a year-over-year 27% hike in revenue to $17.37 billion, and 8% rise in monthly active users, to 2.45 billion.\n\nStill, a MarketWatch analysis of FactSet data found that Facebook was one of five large companies that were the biggest contributors to the earnings recession in the first half of the year. In addition to forking over a $5 billion fine to the FTC for privacy violations this summer, it faces escalating costs to beef up security of its platform.\n\nFor more: Five prominent U.S. companies are most at fault for the earnings recession\n\nRegulatory headaches aren\u2019t Facebook\u2019s only woes.\n\nOf mounting concern is the fragility of Libra, its cryptocurrency platform that is crumbling after key partners eBay Inc. EBAY, +0.26% , Visa Inc. VISA, -2.40% , Mastercard Inc. MA, +0.35% , IPO candidate Stripe, and Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG, +0.20% withdrew from a coalition backing the effort. A week earlier, PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -1.41% dropped out.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg speaks before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, he is expected to tell lawmakers that the company won\u2019t be a part of launching its Libra digital currency anywhere in the world until U.S. regulators approve it.\n\nApple (Oct. 30)\n\nApple is on a roll. Its iPhone 11 announcement in September underwhelmed pundits and analysts, but the company\u2019s stock is at an all-time high on projections for a spike in iPhone sales and a brisk start for Apple TV+, its streaming service that debuts Nov. 1.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives on Oct. 11 raised his price target on Apple shares to $265 from $245 and maintained an Outperform rating. \u201cIn our opinion the lower [iPhone 11] price points, potential content arsenal (through organic and M&A), and massive installed base could enable Apple to disrupt roughly 10% of Netflix\u2019s target customer base within the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Ives wrote. (UBS and Credit Suisse on Oct. 14 became the latest Wall Street firms to express confidence in iPhone sales.)\n\nThe only hitch, analysts agree, is that Apple remains vulnerable to a trade war with China because nearly 20% of its total revenue comes from the region.\n\nApple, which has been quiet about the regulatory climate, also made MarketWatch\u2019s top-5 list of large companies contributing to the earnings recession. The company\u2019s earnings dropped nearly 15% in the first half of 2019 because of declining iPhone sales, as well as geopolitical tensions with China, where it gleans about 20% of total sales.\n\nFactSet has forecast earnings of $2.83 per share and revenue of $62.9 billion for Apple\u2019s fourth quarter.", "description": "For nearly five months, the predominant story line in Big Tech has been its skirmishes with antitrust regulators and their escalating investigations.
