(Image: Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities)\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities has announced new archaeological discoveries in Luxor, highlighted by a remarkable \u201cindustrial zone\u201d in which workers manufactured items for royal tombs.\n\nEgyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass, who headed the excavations, made the announcement on Thursday at a press conference in Luxor, reports Ahram Online. Khaled El-Enan, Egypt\u2019s antiquities minister, along with Mostafa Wazir, the secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, attended Thursday\u2019s press briefing.\n\nSection of the site in the East Valley. (Image: Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities)\n\nThe discoveries were made in the West Valley, commonly known as the Valley of the Monkeys, and in the East Valley, also known as the Valley of Kings\u2014the final resting place of King Tutankhamun.\n\nExcavations in West Valley, which started back in 2017, have yielded an ancient Egyptian industrial zone in which funerary ornaments were produced on a mass scale. It\u2019s the first of its kind to ever be found in the area.\n\n\u201cEach workshop had a different purpose,\u201d Hawass told CNN. \u201cSome were used to make pottery, others to produce gold artifacts and others still to manufacture furniture.\u201d\n\nA limestone fragment discovered at a new excavation site at the Valley of the Monkeys.

The 18th Dynasty\u2014from circa 1549 BCE to 1292 BCE\u2014marked the period in which Egypt emerged as a world power.\n\nWithin this area, the archaeologists also discovered an oven used to burn clay and metal and a \u201ctank\u201d\u2014or more accurately, a pit\u2014that once held drinking water for the workers, according to an Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities statement published at its Facebook page. Accordingly, the discovery could shed light on the working conditions at the time.\n\nThis hole once held drinking water for ancient Egyptian workers.

The team is also hoping to uncover the tombs of three prominent pharaohs: King Amenhotep I, King Tuthmose II and Ramses VIII, reports CNN.\n\nAn assortment of artifacts found in Luxor.

Excavations in the Valley of Kings were described as being the largest since the time of Howard Carter, the famous discoverer of King Tut\u2019s tomb. These digs are happening near the tombs of Ramses VII, Hatshepsut, and Ramses III, according to Ahram Online.\n\nExcitingly, the excavations in the East Valley near King Tut\u2019s tomb resulted in the discovery of other artifacts, including 42 small huts used to store tools, noted the antiquities ministry. Here, the archaeologists also found some hieroglyphic paintings, fragments of carved tombs, and rings from the Ramesside period, which kickstarted the 19th Dynasty (1292 BCE to 1189 BCE).\n\nIt\u2019s unreal how, after so many years of digging, Egyptian archaeologists are still able to uncover new tombs, structures, and artifacts. It\u2019s testament to the massive cultural footprint left behind by the ancient Egyptians.", "description": "The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities has announced new archaeological discoveries in Luxor, highlighted by a remarkable \u201cindustrial zone\u201d in which workers manufactured items for royal tombs....", "authors": ["Hudson Hongo", "Victoria Song"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/yf4fgf1q6m6sgyy5vtm9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
