It involves automated plucking, eviscerating and slicing carcasses at rapid intervals. In the US, it also involves washing the finished product in a chlorine solution. And it\u2019s this final step that has caused an increasingly fractious debate on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s Felicity Lawrence has investigated global food production in a series of expos\u00e9s and tells Anushka Asthana what is really at stake in this debate. There are concerns about the specific health effects of consuming chicken washed in chlorine. But there are also fears that it could mask other problems with the meat \u2013 and rather than disinfecting chicken at the final stage, welfare issues should be addressed much earlier in the process. It\u2019s a symbolic issue that cuts across much of the two countries\u2019 attitudes to food production and one that could ultimately prevent a post-Brexit trade deal.\n\nAlso today: Israelis go to the polls for their second election of the year.
