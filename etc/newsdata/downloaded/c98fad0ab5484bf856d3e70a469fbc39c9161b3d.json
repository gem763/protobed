I shouldn't have done it.\n\n\"I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognise it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Justin Trudeau told reporters: \"I should have known better, but I didn't\"\n\nWhen asked if there had been other occasions, Mr Trudeau told reporters he had also worn make-up when he was a student performing at a talent show in high school.\n\nAn image from that incident has since been posted to Twitter.\n\nA source has confirmed to the BBC that the image is indeed from the second incident Mr Trudeau referred to.\n\nHe wore \"blackface\" and sang Day-O, a Jamaican folk song popularised by American civil rights activist Harry Belafonte.\n\nWhat is 'brownface'?\n\nLike \"blackface\", \"brownface\" typically refers to when someone paints their face darker to appear like someone with a different skin colour.\n\nThe practice is associated with minstrel performances - in past centuries, white actors could be seen with their faces painted black, caricaturing African-Americans, and perpetuating offensive and racist stereotypes.\n\nIn recent years, there have been several controversies involving politicians, celebrities and brands accused of \"blackface\", \"brownface\" or \"yellowface\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Trudeau said \"brownface\" was \"a significant thing that is very hurtful\" to \"communities and people who live with intersectionalities and face discrimination\".\n\nMustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said: \"Seeing the prime minister in brownface/blackface is deeply saddening. The wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology which is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe council added that it recognised \"people can change and evolve over two decades\". Later, the council issued a tweet thanking Mr Trudeau for apologising promptly.\n\nWhat's the political reaction been?\n\nThe picture was racist in 2001 and is racist now, said Andrew Scheer, leader of the opposition Conservatives.\n\n\"What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a total lack of judgement and integrity and someone who is not fit to govern this country,\" he said.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh, said the image was \"troubling\" and \"insulting\".\n\n\"Any time we hear examples of brownface or blackface, it's making a mockery of someone for what they live and what their lived experiences are,\" Mr Singh told journalists on the campaign trail in Toronto.\n\nThe image was also criticised in a tweet by Green Party leader Elizabeth May.\n\nContradicting his brand\n\nAnalysis by Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto\n\nIt is still too early to say how damaging this will be for Justin Trudeau but there is no doubt his tough fight for re-election just got tougher.\n\nCanadians have made clear that they pay attention when Mr Trudeau does something that contradicts his progressive political brand.\n\nHe will also have to explain himself further to the many Canadians from diverse backgrounds who may feel deeply hurt by the image.\n\nJagmeet Singh - who has spoken openly about the racism he faced in Canada growing up - wrote online that this is \"not about the prime minister\".\n\n\"This is about every young person mocked for the colour of their skin, the child who had the turban ripped from their head.\"\n\n'Hypocrite' - Canadian media react\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Four years of Justin Trudeau in two minutes\n\nBrian Lilley, a political columnist for the tabloid Toronto Sun, said it was a \"shocking photo\" and that Mr Trudeau was \"a hypocrite\".\n\n\"Trudeau isn't resigning over this even though he would demand that any other party fire any candidate caught in the same situation,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, political scientist Max Cameron told the Vancouver Sun that Mr Trudeau's apology \"hit all the right notes\", but had still caused \"a real dent in the strongest part of his armour\" as he had built himself up as a defender of multiculturalism and tolerance.\n\nAnalysing the fallout, weekly news magazine Maclean's said, \"Blackface has a long, troubling history in Canada.\"\n\nHowever, Dr Cheryl Thompson, who has researched the phenomenon in Canada, told the magazine it \"was not nearly so widely denounced in 2001 as it is now\".\n\nShe credited Mr Trudeau for apologising unequivocally but said she hoped his colleagues would not \"let him off easily\".\n\nMr Trudeau has taken a pro-immigration stance as prime minister, and worked to appeal to ethnic minority voters.\n\nHowever, his costume choices have attracted criticism in the past - including during a 2018 official visit to India, when his extensive range of traditional Indian outfits were mocked as \"ridiculously overdressed\".\n\nOpinion polls indicate October's election will be a tough race for Mr Trudeau who is seeking a second term in office.\n\nHis campaign got off to a bad start after his plane was grounded by a scraped wing on the first day. A bus ferrying journalists collided with the wing of the Liberal party's chartered Boeing last week.\n\nEarlier this year, in the US, Virginia governor Ralph Northam faced calls to resign over a photo in his 1984 yearbook.\n\nThe photo showed a person in blackface beside another in Ku Klux Klan robes.\n\nMr Northam initially apologised for the photo - but later said he was neither of the men pictured.\n\nHowever, he said he had worn blackface on a separate occasion that year while dressing up as Michael Jackson.", "description": "Canada's PM says he deeply regrets wearing skin-darkening make-up at an Arabian Nights-themed gala.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CB9E/production/_108862125_justin_trudeau_yearbook_05.jpg"}
