( AIMT ) .\n\n\"This is speculative, but it's a good story,\" said Cramer.\n\nLet's see if the good story has good charts. AIMT is a bio pharmaceutical company developing proprietary product candidates and is advancing a therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergies to peanuts and other foods.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of AIMT, below, we can see that prices are trying to stabilize after a decline. Prices are sitting between the declining 200-day moving average line and the flat 50-day moving average line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line unfortunately shows a decline from January to September so prices are trending sideways despite a sign of more aggressive selling. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been improving since early May, which is the earliest sign that prices were trying to stabilize.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of AIMT, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices have been testing the underside of the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line shows improvement over the past two months and is stronger looking than the daily OBV line. The MACD oscillator has turned up to a cover-shorts, buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AIMT, below, we can see a potential upside price target of close to $30.\n\nBottom line strategy: AIMT does not have a strong and developed base, and it is a speculative name according to Cramer, so only small long positions should be considered. Go long above $23 looking for $30 and risking to $18.", "description": "AIMT lacks a strong and developed base, so only small long positions should be considered....AIMT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "If You'Re Not Allergic To Risk", "Consider Aimmune Therapeutics On Strength", "Aimt Lacks A Strong", "Developed Base", "So Only Small Long Positions Should Be Bought.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Dave Butler", "James", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1bcbcbb7-6442-11e8-9389-9f414d75b9ba.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
