Yet there is drama, of a sort, because resorting to these kinds of tactics for a major policy matter signals a profound breakdown somewhere else in the political system. Normally, in matters of great import, people find some more reasonable way of getting things done than by trawling for loopholes in \u201cRobert\u2019s Rules of Order.\u201d\n\nBut then, it\u2019s hard to find a reasonable solution when your voters seem set on the impossible. A majority of Britons may oppose a no-deal Brexit, but one can find the same poll also showing majorities opposing a second referendum \u2014 and earlier polls showed that they weren\u2019t any fonder of the only real alternative to those two options, the \u201csoft Brexit\u201d deal May negotiated with the E.U.\n\nDepending on the outcome of Wednesday\u2019s vote, we\u2019re probably in for even more of this technical procedural maneuvering \u2014 Johnson threatening to call a snap election, Labour threatening to block it. Everyone searching for a loophole that will obscure the choice unreasoning voters have left them: between indefinite years of economically and politically corrosive indecision, or an immediate separation that will at least be definite, but also definitely very painful for everyone involved.", "description": "", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Global-Opinions Boris-Johnson-Is-Presiding-Over-Britains-Stupidest-Hour"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
