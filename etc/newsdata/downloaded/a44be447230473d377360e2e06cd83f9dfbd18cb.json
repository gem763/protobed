Very interesting and secure perspective on life. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nWe all know she has experience. As President George W. Bush's national security adviser, she was tested to the limits during the September 11 terror attacks, which occurred 18 years ago today.\n\nYet, asked by NBC's Savannah Guthrie Wednesday morning if she'd consider serving in that capacity again, she was quick to say no thanks.\n\n\u201cWould you want to be the national security adviser in this administration?\u201d @savannahguthrie asks @CondoleezzaRice pic.twitter.com/puJgmIFyW8 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 11, 2019\n\n\"Oh thank you I\u2019ve done that job,\" Rice answered. \"I think I won\u2019t try to catch lightning in a bottle again.\"\n\nRice may not want the job, but she offered the president some advice as he begins his search. She predicts he\u2019ll find someone \"who suits his style.\" But, more importantly, she hopes he\u2019ll find someone \"who can bring the security team together, because,\" she explained, \"you really have to have the secretary of state, secretary of defense, national security adviser, secretary of the treasury pulling in the same direction.\"\n\nThe members of Trump's national security team weren't exactly singing \"kumbaya.\" The president said he fired Bolton on Monday night because he disagreed with many of his suggestions. Bolton, who insists he resigned, is a war hawk who was a major architect of the 2003 Iraq War. By contrast, 45 has often expressed his wish to get the U.S. out of expensive wars and let these regimes fight their own battles. Bolton was reportedly at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well, and they likely disagreed over a planned peace talk with the Taliban that was scheduled to be at Camp David. Trump said those negotiations had been cancelled once the Taliban admitted to having orchestrated an attack in Kabul, Afghanistan last week that killed civilians and a U.S. serviceman. Just a few days after the failed talks, Bolton was out.\n\nRice weighed in on the cancelled Taliban talks and suggested nothing good could have come out of them.\n\n\u201cNothing about this seemed to be going in the right direction\u2026 We cannot allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven again. There is nothing to suggest that the Taliban would prevent that from happening.\u201d @CondoleezzaRice on Camp David/Taliban meeting pic.twitter.com/70Y6zEYhJD \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 11, 2019\n\nTim rounded up a few more likely contenders in the running to replace Bolton.", "description": ".09/12/2019 3:12:46AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/289/37f2830a-334d-4c6c-9396-b5b47fa26259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
