But, as ever, New Zealand remain the bookies' favourites, but will it be captain Kieran Reid making it three victories in a row for the All Blacks on Saturday November 2?\n\nNew Zealand 13/10\n\nDespite a more temperate year by their own standards, New Zealand still possess ample class, and count some of the world's very best performers among their squad. The pool stage win against South Africa will have settled any pre-tournament doubts, despite giving them a tougher route through the knockout stages. Some reward.\n\nSouth Africa 7/2\n\nRugby Championship winners for the first time since 2009, South Africa's squad is fearsome. They have strong depth in their rampaging forward pack; measured, pragmatic half-backs, and a punishing back-three. A pool-stage loss to New Zealand, has given them a slightly easier draw, too, with Japan and then Wales or France lying in wait. Following the Cherry Blossoms' all-conquering performance against Scotland, however, they will be no pushover for South Africa.", "description": "With the 2019 Rugby World Cup hurtling towards the knockout stages, Telegraph Sport takes a look at how the contenders are shaping up with the bookmakers.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/09/17/TELEMMGLPICT000128217451-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPuL-8ex6Wxr3HGFUi6PIc45tImKey5x700iKis9lGeo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
