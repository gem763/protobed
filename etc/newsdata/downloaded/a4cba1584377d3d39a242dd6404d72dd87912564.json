The Straits Times\n\nThe chief executive of House of Seafood has apologised after its Punggol restaurant was flagged by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) for causing unnecessary harm to crabs by placing them in an arcade claw machine.\n\nIn a statement posted on Facebook on Thursday (Oct 24) morning, Francis Ng said the gimmick was meant to \u201ceducate\u201d children at The Punggol Settlement about marine life.\n\n\u201cWe did not intend to use animals as play things,\u201d Ng said in the post, adding that the company had wanted to \u201cencourage (children) to release the crabs back into the ocean after catching them\u201d.\n\nLifestyle website Shout had reported on Tuesday that the restaurant was charging S$5 per play on the machine, and would cook the crabs for free if diners could successfully catch them.\n\nThe restaurant had also posted a video of customers playing with the machine in early October. It had said then that people who successfully catch a crab with its claw machine could either keep it at the restaurant or have it cooked with chilli sauce, salted egg gravy or black pepper sauce.\n\nA video posted by Shout on Facebook soon caught the attention of the SPCA, who decried the gimmick on its own Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThe game causes unnecessary harm to the animals and it also encourages people to see animals as nothing more than objects to play with and goes against our vision of a kinder society,\u201d the group wrote.\n\n\u201cCrabs are living creatures, not toys,\u201d SPCA said, adding that it had reported the restaurant to the Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) \u201cto ask them to shut this down\u201d.\n\nIn less than 24 hours, SPCA\u2019s post had been shared more than 2,000 times, with netizens slamming the restaurant\u2019s unconventional idea.\n\n\u201cCome on! Can we be a little thoughtful for other living creatures. Imagine yourself being used in a claw machine. It is just sick,\u201d Facebook user Kristin Tan wrote.\n\nAnother Facebook user, Jas Ren\u00e9e Teo, said: \u201cYes, we eat crabs and seafood but this machine is totally unnecessary and only for the added \u2018fun\u2019 for humans.\u201d\n\nA number of users also said they would be boycotting the restaurant as a result.\n\nIn his response on Thursday, Ng said that his team had spent a month thinking of a way to design the game so that it would not harm the crabs in the machine.\n\n\u201cWe have \u2018gloves\u2019 put onto the claws in the machine and we thought about this during the designing stage, to make sure that the claws will not injure or be painful to the crabs.\n\n\u201cWe also clean the game machine every day and let them survive in a good environment,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDue to public feedback, House of Seafood has decided to temporarily stop the use of the claw machine at its restaurant, he added.\n\nHouse of Seafood said it took a month to ensure the design of the machine would not hurt the crabs. The Straits Times\n\nPromising to \u201ccarefully review our system\u201d, Ng wrote: \u201cOnce again, we are deeply sorry and apologise for any inconvenience and unhappiness caused.\u201d\n\nAccording to the House of Seafood website, the Punggol restaurant is its only store in Singapore. It also has another two restaurants in Cambodia and Malaysia.\n\nThe restaurant had gained fame in 2018 after a video of one of its staff doing a \u201cchicken dance\u201d went viral and garnered more than a million views.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"We have \u2018gloves\u2019 put onto the claws in the machine... to make sure that the claws will not injure or be painful to the crabs,\" House of Seafood said..
