Sheppard explained.\n\nThere are several clusters of moons surrounding Saturn which are banded into groups whose names are inspired by various mythologies including the ancient stories of Norse, Gallic or Inuit cultures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outer group is made up of Norse-named objects and includes a newly discovered satellite which is the furthest moon ever discovered around Saturn.\n\n\u2018This kind of grouping of outer moons is also seen around Jupiter, indicating violent collisions occurred between moons in the Saturnian system or with outside objects such as passing asteroids or comets,\u2019 Sheppard added.\n\n\u2018In the Solar System\u2019s youth, the Sun was surrounded by a rotating disk of gas and dust from which the planets were born.\n\n\u2018It is believed that a similar gas-and-dust disk surrounded Saturn during its formation.\n\n\u2018The fact that these newly discovered moons were able to continue orbiting Saturn after their parent moons broke apart indicates that these collisions occurred after the planet-formation process was mostly complete and the disks were no longer a factor.\u2019\n\nA view of the tiny moons captured by a telescope here on Earth (Image: Scott Sheppard)\n\nThe new moons were discovered using the Subaru telescope which sits on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\n\u2018Using some of the largest telescopes in the world, we are now completing the inventory of small moons around the giant planets,\u2019 Sheppard continued.\n\n\u2018They play a crucial role in helping us determine how our Solar System\u2019s planets formed and evolved.\u2019\n\nLast year, Sheppard discovered 12 new moons orbiting Jupiter and Carnegie and launched an online contest to name five of them.\n\nHowever, Moony McMoonFace was definitely not on the list of possible monikers.\n\n\u2018I was so thrilled with the amount of public engagement over the Jupiter moon-naming contest that we\u2019ve decided to do another one to name these newly discovered Saturnian moons,\u2019 Sheppard said.\n\n\u2018This time, the moons must be named after giants from Norse, Gallic, or Inuit mythology.\u2019", "description": "The famous ringed world has more satellites than any other world in humanity's cosmic neighbourhood, new research reveals.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-08-at-11.39.04-4f47_1570531411.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
