When one comes, they all come,\u201d said Callan, who endured six seconds before finally hitting the board.\n\n\u201cHopefully the tide has turned for me and it\u2019s a big wave that I can stay on the crest of for a long time.\u201d\n\nCallan was one of five active jockeys to enter the 11th meeting of the season without a winner and he wasn\u2019t hiding his delight at leaving Umberto Rispoli, Lyle Hewitson, Ben So Tik-hung and Alex Lai Hoi-wing in his wake.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of relief because you don\u2019t want to be the last,\u201d Callan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the position before so I\u2019m not going to let it affect me but in the back of your mind you\u2019re always thinking \u2018I don\u2019t want to be the last, I don\u2019t want to be the last\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t affecting my riding, I feel like I\u2019ve been riding quite well and doing everything right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Callan has experienced a dry spell since first riding here during the 2010-11 season and he has used that experience to his advantage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said numerous times that I\u2019ve been here before and things have gone tough,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I arrived here it wasn\u2019t easy, so it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been there and done it.\n\nYou wait 11 weeks for your first win... then they come along like London buses. Well done, @neilcallan78! 2\u20e3 #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/DPN5dW5Xa2 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI was just relaxed and riding as well as I ever have. I\u2019ve never changed and it just comes down to opportunities.\n\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t getting that many good rides but I was keeping my head down and working away, just trying to get another ride and another ride.\n\n\u201cI was getting dropped off a couple that I was riding that were running well and that kind of put me on the back foot, but then it made me a little bit more determined.\u201d\n\nCallan\u2019s win on Owners\u2019 Star in the Class Three American Club Challenge Cup (1,800m) was especially sweet after he beat $3.10 shot Xiang Bai Qi, a horse he rode in its last start before being replaced by Joao Moreira for Wednesday night\u2019s race.\n\nAfter sitting behind the leaders in the run, the Danny Shum Chap-shing-trained Owners\u2019 Star found enough in the straight to reel in Crown Avenue and salute at $20.25.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for Neil, I am quite friendly with him. He rode a good race and the horse is improving,\u201d Shum said, before explaining the turn of events that led to Callan riding Owners\u2019 Star for the first time.\n\n\u201cHis trial was very good [last week] but Dylan [Mo Hin-tung] was worried about his leg, he said he pulled up no good. So I said \u2018if you don\u2019t think he\u2019s any good, then don\u2019t ride him\u2019. So Neil rode him.\u201d\n\nHappy Warrior was even less popular with punters and was sent out at $28.85, but Callan wasn\u2019t surprised as the John Moore-trained six-year-old produced an electric burst to come from last and win.\n\nIron Man! @neilcallan78 ends a frustrating run of seconds to secure his first win this season! #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/MbIoGM8abt \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been riding him every day and I said to John \u2018I might be mad but he\u2019s jumping out of himself, he\u2019ll run a race.\u2019 He proved me right,\u201d Callan said. \u201cHe showed a nice turn of foot and won well. It\u2019s good that John\u2019s horses are running well and I hope I can get more opportunities.\u201d\n\nMoore finished the night with a double after also saluting with G Unit, while jockey Karis Teetan also enjoyed a fruitful evening, piloting Righteous Mate and Shining Ace to victory.", "description": "It took Neil Callan 46 days and the same amount of rides to notch his first winner of the season but only another 30 minutes to complete a 583-1 double as the Irishman kick-started his campaign at Happy Valley on Wednesday night....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/17/6ac52812-f028-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_034003.JPG?itok=BnsIKxVL&v=1571254810", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
