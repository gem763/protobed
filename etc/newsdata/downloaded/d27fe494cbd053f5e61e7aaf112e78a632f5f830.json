This has stopped me fulfilling that promise.\n\n\u201cLast week the Chairman admitted that she is \u201csupposed\u201d to report to the Leader, but requested that this responsibility be removed.\n\n\"Several NEC members and non-members agreed to this. Even if this request were legitimate, UKIP\u2019s Constitution states clearly that the Leader appoints the Chairman, not the NEC.\n\n\u201cI did not join UKIP in order to waste time on internal conflict, but I have found myself powerless to prevent a purge of good members from the Party. I had believed that UKIP was a highly democratic party, but I have not been able to stop political interference in UKIP ballots. I can not therefore stand publicly for UKIP with a clear conscience.\"", "description": "Richard Braine was leader of his party for less than three months", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653391.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT-UKIP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
