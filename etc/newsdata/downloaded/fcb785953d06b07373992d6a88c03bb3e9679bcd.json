Worryingly, that could still be the situation in three to four months\u2019 time.\n\nIt is another headache for Bruce who is fighting against perceptions he does not have the tactical flexibility to keep Newcastle out of relegation danger.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe has won just one out of his seven games since replacing Rafa Benitez as manager just three weeks before the start of the Premier League season.\n\nSean Longstaff could feature again at the weekend Credit: Action Images via Reuters\n\nNewcastle spent \u00a340m on Brazilian striker Joelinton in the summer but he is still adapting to English football and has managed just one goal so far. The former Hoffenheim player has missed chances and has struggled with being so isolated in attack in recent games, but Bruce is confident he will get better as the campaign progresses.\n\nTime, though, is not on anybody\u2019s side. The Magpies are fourth from bottom in the table and have scored only four goals in the league.\n\nBruce is a huge admirer of Carroll and would love to be able to make him the focal point of the team\u2019s offensive play but knows he must be patient and will not do anything that puts his centre forward at risk.\n\nThat will increase the chances of Newcastle trying to sign another attacking player in the January transfer window, although Dwight Gayle is set to return to training this week, in the hope he can be available for selection for the first time, sometime next month, following a calf injury.\n\nOn the plus side, midfielder Sean Longstaff will be able to play against Leicester at the weekend after recovering from an ankle injury picked up in training. Newcastle\u2019s midfield was over run in the first half against Brighton and there are serious question marks surrounding Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s mobility as he is playing with a long-standing thigh problem.", "description": "Newcastle United\u2019s medical staff fear Andy Carroll will not be able to start a game until after Christmas at the earliest as he continues his rehabilitation from a career-threatening ankle injury.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZFbs1oPWX5nDKgwBK1lLWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pzmRQrj4ii0FeVPF_1bA_Q--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/a456a2ea3188fedb8c7c61b8603c8e3b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
