Although nearly half (48%) of corporate data is stored in the cloud, only a third (32%) of organizations admit they employ a security-first approach to data storage in the cloud.\n\nSurveying over 3,000 IT and IT security practitioners in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, the research found that only one in three (31%) organizations believe that protecting data in the cloud is their own responsibility.\n\nIncreased multi-cloud cloud use, but with risks\n\nWith the proliferation of cloud-based services, businesses and other organizations are increasingly dependent on cloud providers. In fact, nearly half (48%) of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and IBM being the top three. The study found that, on average, organizations use three different cloud service providers and over a quarter (28%) are using four or more.\n\nDespite storing sensitive data in the cloud, nearly half (46%) surveyed revealed that storing consumer data in the cloud makes them more of a security risk. Over half (56%) also noted that it posed a compliance risk. In addition, organizations believe that cloud service providers bear the most responsibility for sensitive data in the cloud (35%), ahead of shared responsibility (33%) and themselves (31%). Even though businesses are pushing the responsibility to cloud providers, only 23% say security is a factor in selecting them.\n\n\u201cWith businesses increasingly looking to use multiple cloud platforms and providers, it\u2019s vital they understand what data is being stored and where,\u201d said Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute. \u201cNot knowing this information makes it essentially impossible to protect the most sensitive data \u2013ultimately leaving these organizations at risk. We\u2019d encourage all companies to take responsibility for understanding where their data sits to ensure it\u2019s safe and secure.\u201d\n\nEncryption increasing, but organizations handing over keys to cloud providers\n\nRoughly half (51%) of businesses and other organizations still do not use encryption or tokenization to protect sensitive data in the cloud. The study uncovered regional disparities in terms of data security, with German organizations being the most advanced in their use of encryption at 66%.\n\nOrganizations are handing over the keys to their encrypted data to cloud providers. Nearly half of cloud companies (44%) provide the encryption keys when data is encrypted in the cloud, ahead of in-house teams (36%) and third parties (19%). On top of this, 53% are controlling these encryption keys themselves, despite 78% saying it\u2019s important their organization retains control of the keys.\n\nOver half of businesses (54%) think cloud storage makes it more difficult to protect sensitive data, up from 49% last year. More than 70% believe that data in a cloud environment is harder to protect due to the complexity of managing privacy and data protection regulations, while an additional two-thirds (67%) cited the difficulty of applying conventional security methods in the cloud.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that businesses today are taking advantage of the opportunities that new cloud options offer, but aren\u2019t adequately addressing data security,\u201d said Tina Stewart, vice president of market strategy for cloud protection and licensing activity at Thales. \u201cHaving pushed the responsibility towards cloud providers, it is surprising to see that security is not a primary factor during the selection process. It doesn\u2019t matter what model or provider you choose, the security of your business\u2019 data in the cloud has to be your responsibility. Your organization\u2019s reputation is on the line when a data breach occurs, so it is critical to ensure in-house teams keep a close eye on your security posture and always retain control of encryption keys.\u201d\n\nFor more information, attend our \u201cGlobal Trends in Cloud Security: Gaps in Security Persist in a Multi-Cloud World\u201d webinar taking place on November 7 or visit the 2019 Thales Cloud Security Study website.\n\nResearch methodology\n\nThis research was conducted by the Ponemon Institute on behalf of Thales with 3,667 IT and IT security practitioners surveyed across the Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIndustry insight and views on the latest data security trends can be found on the Thales blog at blog.thalesesecurity.com.\n\nFollow Thales on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAbout Thales\n\nThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global technology leader shaping the world of tomorrow today.
