What we DO have are commonplace mass shootings with automatic and semi-automatic high powered firearms,\u201d the guitarist tweeted Sunday. \u201cTHAT cannot be disputed. Tell me what we and our government must do. Prayers and sympathy are not enough.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nOn Saturday, the shooter \u2013 described in news reports as a white male in his mid-30s with \u201can AR-type weapon\u201d \u2013 went on a shooting rampage in Odessa, a Texas city less than 300 miles east of El Paso, which also recently witnessed a mass shooting.

Anyone who thinks I should \u2018stay in my lane\u2019 should leave now,\u201d Stanley responded.\n\n\u201cThis is MY house. If you DO have opinions why shouldn\u2019t I? In this case I will leave up some of those dopey comments for your enjoyment. Not again.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have more \u201ccrazy \u201c or \u201cmentally unstable \u201c people in the US.
