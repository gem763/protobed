Manager Gareth Southgate is watching closely, and if Grealish produces more performances like this, it will not be long before he earns a senior cap.\n\nCompetition is fierce in his attacking midfield role, and Grealish was candid enough to say he had little chance of making the squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria after a frustrating start to the season. Yet the Birmingham-born Aston Villa captain has qualities that would enhance most teams.\n\nJack Grealish will surely win an England call-up if he repeats his performance against Norwich\n\nGrealish capped a display full of craft and graft with a well taken second half goal\n\nHe is menacing with the ball and imaginative when releasing it. He can find space between the opposition\u2019s defence and midfield and is happy using both feet.\n\nIn this game, he had more touches and made more passes in the Norwich half than any other Villa player.\n\nThe third goal summed up the best of Grealish: a fluent run from left to right, a simple ball to Anwar El Ghazi and a calm first-time finish with his weaker left foot from the return pass.\n\nGrealish was involved in everything Aston Villa did well in a box-to-box performance\n\n\u2018I know for a fact if I play to the best of my ability then I can get in the England squad,\u2019 he said. \u2018This time, truthfully, I did not expect to get in. If I keep on performing to the way I know I can, hopefully this will give me a big lift and hopefully I will get in soon.\u2019\n\nGrealish \u2018hates\u2019 playing from the left of the attack, his starting position at Carrow Road, but perhaps boss Dean Smith has found the way to bring the best out of him.\n\nThe 24-year-old was given a free role and Norwich had no idea how to mark him.\n\nVilla rode their luck a little in the first half \u2014 full-backs Frederic Guilbert and Matt Targett look exceptionally vulnerable \u2014 but the simple fact is that they have better players than Norwich.\n\nHome manager Daniel Farke will, legitimately, point to his 10 injury absentees, yet the sense here was of two promoted teams heading in opposite directions.\n\nGrealish dislikes playing on the left of the Villa attack but he flourishes when put there\n\nTodd Cantwell was lively for Norwich, who desperately need Teemu Pukki to start scoring again.\n\nFarke revealed that centre back Ben Godfrey will have a hernia operation in Munich early next week.\n\nNorwich desperately need this period to regroup, while Grealish will have a couple of days off in the international break. He should make the most of them, as he may well be working during the next one.", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT CARROW ROAD: The time has surely come for Jack Grealish, Aston Villa's local hero to showcase his talent on the international  stage with England.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/22/19372316-0-image-a-84_1570397573082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
