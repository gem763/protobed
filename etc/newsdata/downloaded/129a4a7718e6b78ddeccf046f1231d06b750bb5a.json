Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), pointed to alarming polling from the Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, which showed that voters think the party is \u201cprioritizing impeachment over other issues,\u201d according to an internal summary obtained by POLITICO.\n\nPelosi responded by saying she was keenly aware of their concerns, and reiterated that the caucus does not have 218 votes for impeachment. And she stressed that only the full House has the power to launch proceedings \u2014 a statement that seems to conflict with the Judiciary Committee\u2019s position that it is currently engaged in an impeachment investigation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
