But Ms Najjar was left with swollen, lumpy lips and forced to pay a further \u00a3700 to have the filler dissolved after a terrible reaction\n\nA dentist who had 'cheap' \u00a3300 lip fillers was left with 'rock hard blue lumps' instead of the 'pillowed pout' she desired after the treatment went horribly wrong\n\nShe said: 'My lips swelled up after I had the filler injected, which I initially thought was normal \u2013 but after a week you could see all these huge blue lumps and they felt rock hard.\n\n'You could see them when I was talking. I was so self-conscious. I was in shock at what I ended up going through for what I'd thought was a simple procedure.\n\n'As a result, I decided to train in facial aesthetics to understand what had gone wrong \u2013 but now, I also want to help other people looking to get fillers done to make sure they understand the risks.\n\n'I get so many women coming in for corrective work after getting botched fillers, and they always say the same thing, 'I went somewhere cheap.' But you have to think, it's cheap for a reason, and it ends up costing you far more to fix it.'\n\nMs Najjar said she had her first cosmetic procedure in 2016 after worrying her natural pout was becoming deflated, believing it to be a simple procedure.\n\nShe continued: 'I admit I didn't research it much which really isn't like me at all. But I never got told about the risks or complications that could arise.'\n\nAfter her appointment \u2013 during which one millilitre of filler was injected into her lips \u2013 she experienced some swelling, which she assumed was normal.\n\nA week later, though, it became clear that something had gone terribly wrong.\n\nMs Najjar was so traumatised by her experience that she decided to train in facial aesthetics, so she could safely perform the procedure and spare others from suffering her fate\n\nNow, after becoming officially trained and qualified to perform injectable filler procedures, she works at The Dental Surgery in Clifton Village, Bristol, where she uses her own experience to make sure patients fully understand the potential risks\n\nShe said: 'My lips were very lumpy and uneven, so I went back to the injector who had done them, and they suggested that even more filler would even them out.\n\n'Looking back, I know that's not right now, but at the time, I trusted what I was being told and just wanted it fixed. So, I had another one millilitre injected \u2013 meaning I'd had two millilitres in just two weeks.\n\n'I woke up and my lips were more swollen than ever \u2013 literally about two centimetres in front of my face \u2013 and rock hard.\n\n'I had to go into work and my practice manager was really shocked, asking me what on earth had happened.'\n\nMs Najjar said she had her first cosmetic procedure in 2016 after worrying her natural pout was becoming deflated, believing it to be a simple procedure\n\nAfter researching extensively, she found a specialist who was able to inject her with hyaluronidase \u2013 a family of enzymes that can break down hyaluronic acid, the ingredient used in most lip fillers\n\nMs Najjar's swelling eventually eased, but she said that her lips were lumpier than ever. She added: 'I was having to massage my lips to break the filler down.'\n\nWith a family wedding approaching, which she wanted to ensure she looked presentable for, Sarah had no choice but to find a dermatologist who could help reverse the damage.\n\nAfter researching extensively, she found a specialist who was able to inject her with hyaluronidase \u2013 a family of enzymes that can break down hyaluronic acid, the ingredient used in most lip fillers.\n\n'That cost me \u00a3700 \u2013 more than double what I'd paid for the original fillers,' she said.\n\n'I did have a slight allergic reaction to the hyaluronidase and my mouth swelled, but I was given antihistamines.\n\n'I actually had the appointment on Christmas Eve, so it was amazing they could see me, as I assumed the doctor would be closed or very busy.\n\n'I was under review for two days after that and, thankfully, my lips began returning to normal.'\n\nShaken by her experience, Ms Najjar decided to take a course in facial aesthetics herself on London's renowned Harley Street.\n\nNow, after becoming officially trained and qualified to perform injectable filler procedures, she works at The Dental Surgery in Clifton Village, Bristol, where she uses her own experience to make sure patients fully understand the potential risks.\n\nShe explained: 'I was never told about risks or complications, so I want to make sure that the patients who come to me understand exactly what will happen before I put that needle in.\n\n'If you don't explain to them that there may be complications, and that hyaluronidase, which they would need to dissolve the filler, is very expensive \u2013 plus there is currently a shortage in many parts of the world, so not every doctor has easy access to it \u2013 then you are leaving them vulnerable.\n\n'The NHS shouldn't have to be dealing with people going to A&E with complications like occlusions, when blood vessels get blocked, but the difficulty is that people aren't told the risks and so don't know what to do.\n\n'It's also really important to give people a cooling off period, so they have 24 hours to go away and think about whether, now they have all the information, they actually want to go ahead. It's not right to do it there and then, as they can feel pressured.'\n\nSarah has expressed concern about the rise in people with no medical training injecting filler into their clients.\n\nAccording to a 2017 statement by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), dermal fillers remain unregulated in Britain, meaning 'anyone wielding a syringe can order them off the internet' and the procedures are often performed in unsterile, non-clinical environments.\n\nAn internal survey by BAAPS of their membership \u2013 also conducted in 2017 \u2013 found that four out of five surgeons have recorded a rise in requests to fix botched procedures, with nearly a third stating that the original work had 'clearly been carried out by someone with dangerously inadequate training.'\n\nKeen to combat the amount of people turning to unqualified people for such cosmetic work, Save Face now provides a national register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical cosmetic treatments recognised by the Department of Health, NHS England and The Care Quality Commission.\n\nThis enables prospective patients to check whether their practitioners have specialist training and use licensed products from reputable suppliers.\n\nMs Najjar said: 'It's worrying the amount of unqualified people now doing dermal fillers. Beauticians don't necessarily go through proper medical training \u2013 they just learn from each other \u2013 and can't prescribe medication if needs be, or deal with complications.\n\n'Make sure ask to see to a practitioner's portfolio so you have an idea what their work is like and what to expect of the treatment.\n\n'Doctors and dentists train for years and years, yet there are people going on one day courses claiming to be able to do the same thing.\n\n'When they're charging low fees for work too, you have to ask yourself why. How cheap is the filler they're using?\n\n'You can easily buy it online for as little as \u00a335 a millilitre \u2013 and that's not something I'd put in my own face, let alone my patients.'", "description": "Noticing her lips looking 'deflated' once she had turned 30, in 2016 Sarah Najjar, now 34, of Bristol, paid \u00a3300 to have lip fillers after admiring the 'pillowed pouts' they had produced on other people.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20025372-0-image-a-19_1571730716134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
