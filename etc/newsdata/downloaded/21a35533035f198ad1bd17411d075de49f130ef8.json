Spicer joked that he is \u201cclearly not the most gifted dancer\u201d and does not tend to receive top scores from judges but noted that \u2013 despite that \u2013 he is never in the bottom two. He attributes that phenomenon to the broad coalition of support from conservatives across the nation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never in the bottom two. And what that means is that people throughout the country \u2013 a lot of your listeners and readers \u2013 are voting, and my votes from people out there in America is offsetting the score not being high,\u201d Spicer said.\n\n\u201cThat really speaks to the support that\u2019s out there,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cIt really shows that we\u2019re offsetting it.\u201d\n\nThe former White House official also noted the significance of DWTS\u2019 ratings and how it demonstrates that the boycotts are a bust.\n\n\u201cWe are the number one show on ABC right now,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd the reason I think that\u2019s interesting is, not because me or anything else, but because there was all this talk when I got on of \u2018boycott this, not watching this,'\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cFor all this talk about when I got announced on the show of people boycotting, what the message sends is, well look. Guess what. A lot of people are really tuning in, and I think that goes part and parcel with what you were talking about,\u201d Spicer continued.\n\nIf all of these people truly were boycotting like they said they were, people \u2013 whether they\u2019re listening to Breitbart or reading Breitbart or Trump supporters or fans of myself on Lindsay or whatever \u2013 are clearly engaged in watching the show in voting, in clicking, in texting, and I think that speaks volumes to your point of well, hopefully people are getting the message.\n\nBoyle mentioned last week\u2019s elimination of NBA star Lamar Odom and asked Spicer if he thought there was a significance to his departure, particularly given the ongoing tension between the NBA and China.\n\n\u201cLamar and I were not that far off in our judges scores, so clearly that meant more people were out there in some way, shape of form voting for me than him,\u201d Spicer said, noting that his supporters are virtually \u201coffsetting\u201d the judges scores and adding that conservatives want to see him advance because they \u201cfeel the cause.\u201d\n\nI think that they feel the cause. That one of their own, one of us, has an opportunity to be this and want to make sure that we show how engaged we are. The people know that, despite all these talks of boycotts and tuning and whatever, that there are groups of people throughout country \u2013 and largely what we call flyover country \u2013 that are engaged in the process and do watch television. And advertisers and programers should really think a lot more about engaging with us and being part of that national dialogue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the loudest voices on the left that get to dominate,\u201d Spicer added.\n\nSpicer will perform on DWTS Monday evening. Voting begins at 8 p.m. EST and runs through 10 p.m. EST.
