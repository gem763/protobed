October is the month of the Rosary.\n\nThe eRosary is an app-driven device that can be worn as a bracelet. To activate it, all you have to do is make the sign of the cross, similar to how Catholics begin praying the Rosary.\n\nOnce activated, the wearer can choose between three different options to pray. There is the standard rosary, a contemplative rosary or a thematic rosary, which will be updated every year. The device shows the users progress throughout each prayer and keeps track of each rosary completed.\n\nThe interactive device is a push from the church to reach tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z.", "description": "The Vatican announced the launch of the \"Click to Pray eRosary\" Wednesday, during the month of the Rosary.", "authors": ["Gabrielle Sorto"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016132207-vatican-click-to-pray-erosary-trnd-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
