Employees of Gates\u2019 namesake foundation reportedly also met with Epstein, in multiple visits to the disgraced financier\u2019s mansion.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gates declined to say how many times the pair had met\n\nPreviously, Gates had told The Wall Street Journal that he didn\u2019t have a \u201cbusiness relationship or friendship\u201d with Epstein. \u201cI met him,\u201d Gates told the Journal on September 10th. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any business relationship or friendship with him. I didn\u2019t go to New Mexico or Florida or Palm Beach or any of that. There were people around him who were saying, hey, if you want to raise money for global health and get more philanthropy, he knows a lot of rich people.\u201d\n\nIn The New York Times article, a spokeswoman for Gates declined to say how many times the pair had met. The paper\u2019s reporting shows that Gates met with Epstein \u201cnumerous times,\u201d including at least three times at Epstein\u2019s townhouse. \u201cHis lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me,\u201d Gates wrote in a 2011 email to colleagues. His spokeswoman says he was \u201creferring only to the unique d\u00e9cor of the Epstein residence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Gates regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so,\u201d his spokeswoman told The New York Times. \u201cGates recognizes that entertaining Epstein\u2019s ideas related to philanthropy gave Epstein an undeserved platform that was at odds with Gates\u2019s personal values and the values of his foundation.\u201d\n\nEpstein told the people there that his conviction for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl was no worse than \u201cstealing a bagel\u201d\n\nThe Gates Foundation has committed $1 billion to gender equality. Melinda Gates, Bill\u2019s wife and co-chair of The Gates Foundation, has said $1 billion is \u201conly a small fraction of what\u2019s necessary.\u201d The foundation has often touted its commitments to women and girls.\n\nIn 2011, Gates instructed a team to meet Epstein at his townhouse to discuss philanthropic fundraising, The New York Times reports. Epstein told the people there that his conviction for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl was no worse than \u201cstealing a bagel,\u201d according to two people who were there.\n\nThe two remained in contact, and at one point in 2013, Gates flew on Epstein\u2019s jet from New Jersey to Palm Beach, Florida, according to a flight manifest. Gates\u2019 spokeswoman claims Gates, who owns his own private jet, didn\u2019t know it was Epstein\u2019s plane. Though the relationship between Gates and Epstein apparently cooled off after 2014, the Gates Foundation remained in contact with Epstein through 2017.\n\nAccording to today\u2019s reporting, two members of Gates\u2019 inner circle served as intermediaries between Gates and Epstein. One, Melanie Walker, met Epstein after she graduated from college in 1992; she moved to New York, where she stayed in a building owned by Epstein. She also worked for Epstein in 1998 as a science advisor, after graduating from medical school. She joined the Gates Foundation in 2006.\n\nThat was where she met Boris Nikolic, who was the Gates Foundation\u2019s science advisor. She introduced him to Epstein. Nikolic, who now runs a venture capital firm, was named as a fallback executor to Epstein\u2019s will. (He has declined to do so in court proceedings.) Gates is an investor in Nikolic\u2019s fund. According to The New York Times, Nikolic says: \u201cI deeply regret ever meeting Mr. Epstein.\u201d", "description": "Epstein was involved with Gates personally and with his namesake foundation", "authors": ["Elizabeth Lopatto", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yl_yg5GON36DRqxCJClxNOvfLY=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13752442/vrg_bill_gates_JD0A0280_crop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
