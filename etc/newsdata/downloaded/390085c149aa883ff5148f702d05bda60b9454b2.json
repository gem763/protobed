And I encourage those leaders to be mindful of their actions moving forward because their words have jeopardized the integrity of the city of Dallas as well as the Dallas Police Department.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPolice said the suspects \u2014 Jacquerious Mitchell, 20, Michael Mitchell, 32, and Thaddeous Green, 22 \u2014 met up with the 28-year-old Brown outside his home Friday evening. Green got out of the car to talk with Brown and the two began arguing.\n\nJacquerious Mitchell later told authorities that when he got out of the car too, Brown shot him in the chest. Green then returned fire, police said, hitting Brown twice in the lower body. Green grabbed Brown\u2019s gun and backpack and the three suspects took off, with Michael Mitchell at the wheel.\n\nAD\n\nHe dropped Green off at an unknown location, police said, and drove Jacquerious to a hospital, where he was later taken into custody. Michael Mitchell and Green are still at large, but police have issued warrants for their arrest. All three men will face capital murder charges.\n\nAD\n\nPolice searched Brown\u2019s apartment and said they confiscated 12 pounds of marijuana, 143 grams of THC cartridges and $4,000 in cash.\n\nThe Brown family lawyer, who also represents Jean\u2019s family, continued his calls for the Dallas department to recuse itself from the investigation. The attorney, Lee Merritt, has argued that the proximity of Brown\u2019s killing to the Guyger trial \u2014 which led to a 10-year sentence for the former officer and raised questions about the integrity of some current members \u2014 implicates the force and undermines its credibility.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is important for everyone involved that this case not only be solved but the conclusions arrived to by investigators be seen as authentic and reliable,\u201d Merritt said in a statement. \u201cA cloud of suspicion will rest over this case until steps are taken to ensure the trustworthiness of the process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMerritt, who previously said that law enforcement involvement shouldn\u2019t be ruled out,\u201d tweeted on Tuesday night that he\u2019s glad authorities believe they have identified suspects, but asked for another agency to take over the investigation, \u201cto make sure all the bases are covered due to the circumstances in this case.\u201d\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, agreed in a statement later that night.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is critical to public confidence in the administration of justice that witnesses who speak out against police violence are fully protected,\u201d she said. \u201cThe suspicious circumstances of Mr. Brown\u2019s killing should cause great alarm and demand an immediate and piercing inquiry.\u201d\n\nAs news of the police account of Brown\u2019s death spread, some advocates expressed doubts, particularly about the idea that the three men would make a 300-mile drive to purchase drugs.\n\nAD\n\nClint Smith, a writer and fellow at the think tank New America, called the explanation \u201cinsulting.\u201d Radio host and political analyst Zerlina Maxwell said it is \u201cpatently ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBrown took the stand on the second day of the Guyger trial and wept as he described the final seconds of Jean\u2019s life. Brown, who at the time lived in the apartment across from Jean\u2019s, told jurors he was walking toward his unit when he overheard what sounded like a surprise meeting between Jean and Guyger.\n\nAD\n\nBrown said he couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying but said he was sure he didn\u2019t hear Guyger shout at Jean, \u201cLet me see your hands!\u201d \u2014 a command Guyger said she repeated several times before shooting Jean. This testimony contradicted \u201ca key element of the defense,\u201d Merritt said the day after Brown was killed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmber claimed she shouted commands to Botham before shooting him,\u201d Merritt wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. No one heard that. No neighbors. No passerby\u2019s. Not Joshua as he walked down the corridor. No one.\u201d\n\nBrown ran when he heard two gunshots. Then, worried about his dog, he headed back toward his unit. Through the peephole in his door, he said, he watched Guyger pacing the hallway and talking on her phone.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe was crying,\u201d Brown testified during the trial. \u201cExplaining what happened, what she thought happened. Saying she came into the wrong apartment.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at his lap, wiped his eyes with his T-shirt and reached for a box of tissues. He said he only met Jean once, just hours before the September 2018 shooting. But Brown used to hear him across the hall, singing gospel songs and rapping Drake lyrics: \u201cI heard him singing every morning,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nOriginally from Jacksonville, Fla., Brown moved to Texas in 2008. After graduating high school, he returned to Florida for college and played defensive back on the University of South Florida football team. After graduating, he said he moved back to Dallas and ran a company that managed Airbnb properties.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis murder underscores the reality of the black experience in America,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cA former athlete turned entrepreneur \u2014 Brown lived in constant fear that he could be the next victim of gun violence, either state sanctioned or otherwise.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Police said the suspects traveled from Louisiana to buy drugs from Brown.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter", "Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dq37f7b5CvjgF-HcwzFFuurbUrY=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-07-2019/t_7f1832e353614a31bb07cba8baee01eb_name_guyger_jean.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
