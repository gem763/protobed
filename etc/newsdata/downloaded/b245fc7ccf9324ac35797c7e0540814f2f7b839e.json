But they aren\u2019t isolated. They are the latest in a series of supply shocks for the American and global economies.\n\nSome are idiosyncratic and acute, like the grounding of Boeing Co. \u2019s 737 MAX airliner\u2014which is nudging up airfares\u2014or an outbreak of African swine fever that has sent Chinese pork prices soaring. Others are more systemic and slower moving: A retreat from globalization is raising trade barriers; resistance to immigration could aggravate labor shortages in aging countries such as the U.S.; and geopolitical threats hang over the oil market.\n\nBy restricting the supply of a vital product or input, such shocks can undermine economic growth, push up inflation, or both.\n\nRight now, investors and economists see these supply shocks as a threat to growth, but not inflation. That\u2019s understandable: Recession risks have been uncomfortably high and inflation has been too low for the Federal Reserve\u2019s comfort.\n\nNonetheless, after a puzzling slide in the spring, inflation excluding food and energy in the past few months has bounced back to around 2%. The U.S. shows no sign of slipping into recession and the labor market\u2014judging by the unemployment rate\u2014is the tightest in half a century. This isn\u2019t necessarily a reason for the Fed to avoid cutting interest rates, as it plans to this week. It is a reason, however, to reject calls to slash them more deeply. The probability that inflation takes off isn\u2019t high, but in these circumstances it definitely isn\u2019t zero.\n\nOil shocks certainly matter less than they once did. In the late 1970s, the U.S. spent 4.5% of gross domestic product on crude oil, much of it imported. Last year it spent just 2.4% and the shale revolution could soon make the U.S. a net exporter.\n\nYet given its modest cushion of spare capacity, the oil market is always vulnerable to disruptions. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm, says spare capacity world-wide stood at 3% before the weekend\u2019s outages. Spare capacity was usually around 5% in the 1990s while geopolitical risks were lower than today, he says.\n\nRapidan estimates that as of August, 2.8 million barrels of the world\u2019s daily production capacity of 100 million were currently offline because of geopolitical disruptions like American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. It classifies another 17 million barrels in the Persian Gulf as being at risk of such disruption because of potential conflict with Iran, as the weekend attack illustrated.\n\nAs with oil shortages, labor strikes aren\u2019t the threat they used to be. General Motors accounted for 30% of auto sales in the late 1990s. That has dropped to 17% today. The United Auto Workers at present has about 400,000 members, down from 1.5 million in 1979.\n\nMore broadly, American workers\u2019 bargaining power has been eroded by decades of outsourcing, automation and weakening unions. Work stoppages averaged 300 a year from 1947 to 1979; that has fallen to just 20 in the last two decades.\n\nYet the tide may be turning. If the U.S. isn\u2019t at full employment, it is certainly close. Wage growth has accelerated. Workers battered by years of austerity and belt tightening are rediscovering their leverage. So far this year 329,000 workers were involved in strikes, more than in any full year since 2000, except last year when thousands of teachers walked off the job. And that doesn\u2019t count the UAW strike or a threatened work action by more than 80,000 employees at health-care giant Kaiser Permanente.\n\nHow the Saudi Oil Attack Could Ripple Through the Global Economy The recent attack on a Saudi oil facility could have long-lasting repercussions.

California is poised to reclassify many contract workers, like Uber and Lyft drivers, as employees eligible for the minimum wage and other benefits. And the Trump administration plans to make millions more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nGlobalization has been a counterweight to inflationary pressure. Competition from imports curbed companies\u2019 ability to raise prices and wages or prompted them to move production abroad. President Trump seeks to reverse that.\n\nFrom 2000 through 2017, the average U.S. tariff on imports was below 2%, according to the World Bank. Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates it will approach 6% by the end of the year if Mr. Trump\u2019s remaining tariffs go into effect as scheduled. This may not bring many jobs back, but it is already raising costs as companies relocate supply chains and pass tariffs along to customers.\n\nInflation has in recent decades failed to take off in large part because the public doesn\u2019t expect the Fed to let it, and such expectations are self-fulfilling. But if Mr. Trump\u2014or a Democratic successor\u2014pressures the Fed into keeping rates low to serve their political priorities, those expectations could change. Then, all the ingredients would be in place for inflation\u2019s return.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What impact will recent shocks like oil disruptions and strikes have on your job or your finances?
