Not all smog is from Indonesia,\u201d said Indonesia\u2019s environment minister, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, in a statement on Wednesday, in a rebuke of its neighbour.\n\nSiti Nurbaya accused Malaysia of a lack of transparency, saying the smog affecting Malaysia could have originated from Sarawak, peninsular Malaysia or Indonesian Borneo. \u201cThe Malaysian government should explain this objectively,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Malaysia\u2019s environment and climate change minister, Yeo Bee Yin, wrote on Facebook: \u201cLet the data speak for itself. Minister Siti Nurbaya should not be in denial.\u201d\n\nIn the post Yeo included data from the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which showed the total number of hotspots in Kalimantan was 474, with 387 in Sumatra. By comparison, only seven were recorded in Malaysia.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Disaster Mitigation Agency said more than 3,600 fires had been detected on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo by weather satellites, leading to very poor air quality in six provinces with a combined population of more than 23 million.\n\nMalaysia complains of smog from Indonesian forest fires Read more\n\nOn Friday, Malaysia sent a diplomatic note urging Indonesia to take immediate action to address the fires. Malaysia has shut more than 400 schools in the eastern state of Sarawak and sent half a million face masks to the area to combat poor air quality.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Map showing hotspot activities in Sumatra and Kalimantan which are likely to continue under the prevailing dry conditions.
