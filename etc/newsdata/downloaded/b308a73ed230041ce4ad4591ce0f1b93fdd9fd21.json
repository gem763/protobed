At the time it launched, the gap between the best interest-paying easy access account and easy access Isa had narrowed to just 0.01 per cent.\n\nSavers looking for tax-free accounts have for some time suffered from rates that are lower than on standard savings deals.\n\nAccording to Moneyfacts, over the last three years the difference between the top easy access Isa and easy access savings account has been around 0.15 per cent.\n\nHowever, in both May and June this year the best variable rate easy access Isa did at least match the best easy access savings account.\n\nVirgin Money recently lifted its cash Isa, which comes without a bonus rate but limits you to two withdrawals a year, to 1.45 per cent, which puts it at parity with the top interest-paying savings accounts.\n\nThe closing of the gap is more likely due to a fall in easy access rates rather than a real rise in Isa rates, though we did see some Isa competition earlier this year, with one major high street bank in Santander getting in on the act.\n\nMoneyfacts' Rachel Springall said: 'It's fantastic to see a market-leading Isa launched for customers who want a bit of flexibility with their cash, particularly with a trusted brand.\n\n'Savers who are looking for a decent return and who may not have utilised their Isa allowance yet may find this an appealing choice.\n\n'Savers must familiarise themselves with the terms of the account, as it poses withdrawal restrictions and carries a bonus.'", "description": "Coventry's Limited Access Isa now pays 1.46 per cent, 0.01 percentage points higher than the standard easy access savings options offered by Cynergy Bank, Marcus and Virgin Money.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
