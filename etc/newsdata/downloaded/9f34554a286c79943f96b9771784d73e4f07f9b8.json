Kamala Harris (D-CA), photoshopped his candidate in the now infamous photo of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi standing up and confronting President Trump during their tense meeting on Syria. He did this for reasons unbeknownst to us. We took a screen shot of the image before Sams deleted it.\n\nKamala Harris' national press secretary has deleted his attempt at a meme. pic.twitter.com/82cDRn2ndA \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 17, 2019\n\nTwitter had questions. Like, how exactly does this do Sen. Harris any favors?\n\nIs the 'upgrade' that Kamala ate a Mario mushroom and is nine feet tall? Or that she has the same cabinet as Trump and thinks it's good p.r. to photoshop herself getting taken to the cleaners by Pelosi? \u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) October 17, 2019\n\nSo you're saying Kamala will do a better job implementing Trump's agenda than Trump? You thought through this well. \u2014 sharia board ??????????? (@SirajAHashmi) October 17, 2019\n\nBut. The Most Savage Response award goes to Jesse Hunt.\n\nCan Kamala's staff photoshop her into this tweet? https://t.co/nC8y94LXNm \u2014 Jesse Hunt (@JJHunt10) October 17, 2019\n\nHarris needs to catch a break. As the above poll indicates, her support has been cratering, and her debate performances have become pandering, repetitive messes. That's according to a CNN focus group, not me.\n\nEven her fellow Democrats onstage can't help mocking her just a little bit. She's probably still smarting from the cold shoulder she got from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at Tuesday's debate. Harris tried to get Warren to support her quest to delete President Trump's Twitter account.\n\n\"Will you join me?\" Harris asked her.\n\n\"No,\" Warren replied, without looking at her.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:06:42PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/502723a6-7627-4299-9563-e156bae92961.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
