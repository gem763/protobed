Yet still she couldn\u2019t claim to be content.\n\nNow, six years on, Jane reveals she is expecting her first child \u2013 and finally says she has found genuine contentment.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cSeeing the positive pregnancy test was more exciting than seeing the winning numbers on my lottery ticket,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy time but I am so happy.\n\nJane, wise at 23, continued: \u201cPeople think \u00adwinning the lottery is the best thing that can happen to you but this is \u00adsomething that no amount of cash could buy.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks buying a flash car is exciting but in reality, for me, shopping for a pram is ten times more fulfilling.\n\n\u201cWhen you suddenly come into a lot of money you become isolated and desperate to build bonds and relationships.\n\n\u201cFor the first time I feel like I will have someone new in my life who loves me for me and not because of my bank balance. And that is such a comforting thing.\u201d\n\n(Image: MediaUse.co.uk)\n\nJane, who lives with her mum in Edinburgh, says she is not in a relationship with the father, a friend called Barry.\n\n\u201cI had imagined finding a boyfriend, settling down and then having a baby, but it just didn\u2019t work out that way,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBarry and I originally started talking over social media and grew into friends.\n\n\u201cWe became close and one night things naturally progressed. We are both \u00adcommitted to being parents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful he works full-time and is a good person.\u201d\n\nJane has struggled to find true love. Last November she even launched a website to offer a \u00a360,000-a-year \u00adsalary for Mr Right.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nA string of high-profile \u00adromances with X Factor star Sam Callahan in 2017 and Dundee FC\u2019s Jordan Piggott in 2018 crashed and burned.\n\nDiscovering her pregnancy initially made her head spin. \u201cIt was a mixture of \u00adexcitement and fear,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI called the father instantly while he was at work and, like me, he was really shocked.\n\n\u201cIt took him 24 hours to get his head around it but then he called and I could tell the shock grew to nervousness, followed by excitement.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt is all becoming more real and he\u2019s doing everything he can to be involved.\u201d\n\nThree months into her pregnancy, Jane reflected on how \u00adimpending motherhood has changed her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve all of a sudden felt like someone with responsibility and will have to be completely unselfish and look after this little person.\n\n\u201cNo amount of money can change the fact that my baby is coming in six months and that\u2019s helping me to mentally prepare.\u201d\n\nThe pregnancy \u00adfollows a \u00adturbulent six years since her 2013 win.\n\nThe new teenage millionaire quit her \u00a38-an-hour job, spent two months in Magaluf and bought a chihuahua and a three-bedroom home.\n\nShe splashed out on a \u00a325,000 BMW, a \u00a317,000 VW Beetle and a \u00adcustomised Range Rover for \u00a318,000.\n\n(Image: MediaUse.co.uk)\n\nJane had a Brazilian bum lift in Turkey \u2013 which was botched \u2013 and a \u00a350,000 makeover, including breast enhancement. She recalled: \u201cI \u00ad struggled with feeling isolated and scared.\n\nI wrongly publicised my win so as a 17-year-old girl living in a house alone for the first time it was terrifying knowing that everyone knew I was a millionaire.\n\n\u201cI moved back into my family home within a couple of months and rented out my properties. It made me different to everyone of my age. I felt like I lost my place in the world.\u201d\n\nIn May she revealed how she was selling \u00a350 topless photos online and donating proceeds to charity \u2013 but insisted she felt \u201cempowered\u201d and \u201clike Robin Hood\u201d.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nJane said: \u201cI have always been open about spending on cosmetic procedures. It came from wanting to be accepted and desirable in a way but also because I have had people be really unkind about my looks since I have been in the public eye.\n\n\u201cI know my body will change as I become a mum but suddenly superficial things like that don\u2019t seem as \u00adimportant to me now. As long as I have a happy and healthy baby I don\u2019t mind the way I look.\u201d\n\nJane \u2013 who has vowed to be a \u201cglam\u201d mum \u2013 went on: \u201cWinning the lottery sounds exciting but you don\u2019t have anything to break the year up because you have money and you\u2019re not working for anything.\n\n\u201cI used to get jealous when people would say, \u2018I can\u2019t wait till Friday.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll that a weekend meant for me is \u00adhaving people to socialise with while they weren\u2019t working. The rest of the time I was just waiting, feeling lost.\n\nHaving a child will change all of that. My days will become full of hard work and not empty like they have been. I will always have someone else \u00adrelying on me which will be a whole new purpose I have never had before.\n\n\u201cThe idea of being stood in a school playground in four years time chatting to other parents that I will have something in common with really excites me.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 Jane threatened to sue Euromillions for negligence, claiming her win ruined her life, before dropping the case. Organiser Camelot said at the time it had offered her \u201congoing support\u201d since her win.\n\nShe has called for the age for buying a ticket to be raised from 16 to 18.\n\nJane said: \u201cMy child won\u2019t be buying a lottery tickets until they are at least eighteen. I would never want them to have the experiences I have had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really sensible with my money, I\u2019ve bought properties and made long-term investments.\u201d\n\nJane even imagines going into business with her baby. \u201cI want my child to have a work ethic,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI want to build a business, \u00adeventually have my child working with me and I\u2019ll have peace of mind they have a work ethic and can eventually leave it to them.\n\n\u201cI now have a reason to plan for the future, something I never \u00adneeded to do before.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Jane Park failed to find happiness despite spending a fortune on luxury goods and cosmetic surgery - now she's hoping her baby will give her the contentment she always craved", "authors": ["Amy Sharpe", "Image", "Daily Record", "Mediause.Co.Uk", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729245.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IMG_0743.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
