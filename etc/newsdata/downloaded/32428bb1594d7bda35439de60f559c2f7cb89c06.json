The horse has long bolted.\u201d The senior official also referred to comments he had previously made in 2018, when he told BBC Newsnight that Bercow was prone to \u201cover-the-top anger\u201d.\n\nDavid Leakey alleged that the speaker created a climate of \u201cfear and intimidation\u201d in Parliament.\n\nMr Leakey told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cI doubt I will make a complaint via the new process. Bercow will soon be outside the jurisdiction of Parliament, and there would be no sanctions that could be applied against him by the time a complaints process was complete, if it found him to have behaved inappropriately.\u201d\n\nI did not call for this lightly but I believe the change in culture has to come from the top and I no longer believe that the Speaker can provide that leadership. I will continue to work with colleagues from across the house to ensure that we create a workplace to be proud of. https://t.co/Mzc63gk6u7 \u2014 Kevin Barron MP (@KevinBarronMP) October 16, 2018\n\nCalls for Bercow\u2019s resignation over the bullying scandal date back to 2018, when Sir Kevin Barron MP wrote in The Times: \u201cThe change in culture has to come from the top, and unfortunately I no longer believe that the speaker, John Bercow, is the correct person to provide that leadership, so he should step down.\u201d\n\nA Commons Commission said that MPs \u201ctoo often failed to honour the responsibility to provide a workplace free from bullying and harassment\u201d.\n\nThe statement came in response to a report by Dame Laura Cox, which detailed harassment and bullying in the House of Commons. The report recommended that allegations of bullying by the speaker should be investigated.\n\nLast week, the Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told Sky News that ousting Bercow over the alleged instances of bullying would be a \u201ccomplete cop-out\u201d and that all of Parliament must \u201ctake responsibility now, both for what\u2019s happened and how it can change\u201d.\n\nIn his interview with the Sunday Telegraph, David Leaky suggested going after the peerage that is typically afforded to former Speakers of the House of Commons. He said that Bercow did not deserve the honour as he \u201cset an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the Chamber and on TV\u201d.\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe icing on the cake of an Establishment stitch-up in the public perception would be for Mr Bercow to be given a peerage. It would be a scandal that Parliament would struggle to live down.\u201d", "description": "Two former officials have described Parliament\u2019s handling of accusations of bullying by John Bercow an \u201cestablishment stitch-up\".", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/John-Bercow-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
