How homeowners can stay alive", "language": "en", "text": "Extension cords are common household items that almost everyone takes for granted. During a recent safety meeting at our office, I was surprised to learn just how dangerous they can be. Inspired, I went home to check mine out. As I suspected, my cords were all ancient and ratty. It was time to head to our local \u201cbig box\u201d to get replacements.\n\nWhen I got there, I was confronted by a wall of products. So many that it stopped me in my tracks. The options were staggering. Adding to my confusion was heaps of mysterious and sometimes misleading information spread all over the packaging. I learned that my new cord could be had in versions with UL listing, 3-wire design, Multi-outlet, indoor only, outdoor weather resistant, 13amp, 1625 watt, 16/3, 125V, designer, basic, NEMA, reinforced blades, oil resistant, vinyl jacket and tangle-free. The cords were available in 3\u2019,6\u2019,10\u2019, 12\u2019, 15\u2019, 25\u2019, 50\u2019, and 100\u2019 lengths, and I could have them in white, brown, green, black, yellow, blue, pink, orange or red.\n\nI got to thinking that if I am having this much trouble buying an extension cord, how in the world is the average joe ever going to able to do it? So, in this post, I am going to take you through my learning process and explain a few important and surprising things I discovered about extension cords. Hopefully it will help you.\n\nConstruction sites are dangerous places, so the US government Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established regulations to help make them as safe as possible. One area of concern is working around electricity. After falls, electrical related injuries are the second leading cause of accidental death at work. Turns out, there are many ways to be electrocuted and every one of them can be prevented. For this reason, has developed electrical safety procedures that prevent electrocution on the jobsite.\n\nHomeowners can also benefit from these safety regulations. Let\u2019s start with some simple OSHA best practices around extension cords. Since we all use extension cords at some time or another, these simple rules will help provide a much safer household for you and your family.\n\nA lot of people consider extension cords as little more than objects of convenience. When we need one, most of us are in the habit of grabbing any cord available. An old Christmas tree cord stuffed in the junk drawer might get used for powering a coffee maker, a vacuum or a jackhammer. Think back and you will probably remember times you used a cord with bent or broken prongs, exposed wires, missing ground plugs, or frayed jackets.\n\nYou may not have even noticed that these were problems. But ignorance can get you killed so listen up. We all need to think differently about these products. Power cords are actually electrical devices that are used to provide a safe, flexible and extended high voltage electrical source for your power equipment.\n\nHere are five really important OSHA extension cord rules you must learn and teach your family to follow.\n\nRule 1\n\nOnly use extension cords with GFCI protection. GFCI stands for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter and it will disconnect power if a potentially dangerous situation occurs. A GFCI compares current flowing through the cord and disconnects the power of there is a \u201cleak\u201d or imbalance of 4-6mA. The GFCI\u2019s are not expensive and can be a real life-saver. If you do not have a \u201cbuilt-in\u201d GFCI cord, you may also plug your ordinary cord into a known GFCI outlet or a known GFCI protected circuit. Unfortunately, not every outlet or circuit in your home is GFCI protected. Unless you know for sure it is easier to just have a cord with the protection built in.\n\nRule 2\n\nUse only one cord per tool up to 100 feet in length. Do not exceed 100\u2019 feet. If a project requires more than 100 feet in distance, a temporary power distribution box will need to be installed. Never plug one extension cord into another. This mistake can lead to fires, equipment failures and electrocution. Power cord ratings are determined by length. Plugging two cords together reduces their current capacity in half which will result in voltage drop and overheating. To avoid having to calculate and worry about voltage drop problems, it is recommended that you only purchase cords made with 12-gauge wire. This gauge wire will handle any of your power tools without problems even over 100\u2019 lengths. Forget about cheaper cords made with smaller gauge wire.\n\nRule 3\n\nDo not use a damaged cord. Electrical or duct tape on the cord is an indicator that the cord was damaged and repaired. The cord may still work but it is a violation of the OSHA regulations. Extension cords may not be patched. The only acceptable repair to a damaged cord is to cut off the damaged area and install a new end. This may shorten the cord but is acceptable. Surface damage that penetrates through the outer protective jacket of the cord is considered permanent and unrepairable. Take care to protect you cords. It is easy to damage them by dropping tools or materials on them, by driving over them or pinching or kinking them.\n\nRule 4\n\nExtension cords cannot be attached to walls or ceilings using metal nails or staples. Cords are manufactured with a relatively soft flexible jacket which makes the vulnerable to damage. They are especially at risk when nails or staples are used to secure them or even if they are installed adjacent to the cord. Any impacts, pinching or bending can damage the cord. Even if the cord is undamaged during the installation any pulling on the cable can wear through the jacket accidentally.\n\nRule 5\n\nDo not run cords through doorways or under rugs. This rule helps avoid two causes of problems: trips/falls and traffic damage to the cord. Cords should be plugged into outlets in the same room where work is being performed. Lay the cords around the edges. Avoid laying cord across the room where it might become a trip hazard or get rolled over by something heavy.\n\nSummary\n\n1. Every extension cord needs a GFCI\n\n2. Never plug one extension cord into another\n\n3. Do not repair damaged extension cords between the ends\n\n4. Extension cords may not be held in place by metal nails or staples\n\n5. Extension cords may not be run through doorways\n\n6. Learn how to properly coil and store your cord\n\nHere are some references to the OSHA rules:\n\nRecommendations:\n\nFor work get a 50\u2019 or 100\u2019 12-gauge cord with a built in GFCI. Get one with an illuminated end. That way you can see instantly that it is powered up and save a 200\u2019 walk to and from the receptacle. Get a cord with high quality terminations (ends) and a heavy-duty protective jacket. Keep your cords safe. Don\u2019t allow heavy objects to run over them and store them properly when not in use. Forget clever and expensive coiling and storing products.
