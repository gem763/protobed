Erdo\u011fan is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Sochi on Tuesday, where it is expected more concrete talks on the size of Turkey\u2019s planned buffer zone will take place.\n\nThe initial plan was met with scepticism by many Syrian Kurds on Thursday night, as it gives the Turks what they had sought to achieve with the military operation in the first place: removal of Kurdish-led forces from the border.\n\nWhen asked, Pence remained silent on whether the agreement amounted to a second abandonment of the US\u2019s former Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nA statement released after the meeting reiterated the US understanding of Turkey\u2019s need for a safe zone which will be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces\u201d after the Kurdish withdrawal, implying that Ankara still intends to occupy the 270m (440km) stretch of land, which includes several important Kurdish towns and parts of a major highway.\n\nIt also made no mention of the presence of Syrian government and Russian troops, who were invited to the area by the SDF to help defend against the Turkish attack, and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement.\n\n\u201cOur people did not want this war. We welcome the ceasefire, but we will defend ourselves in the event of any attack \u2026 Ceasefire is one thing and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves. We will not accept the occupation of northern Syria,\u201d the Kurdish political leader Saleh Muslim told local television.\n\nWho is in control in north-eastern Syria?\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil Turkey launched its offensive there on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.\n\nSince the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by Turkey and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.\n\nThat leaves north-eastern Syria divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the SDF come to control the region?\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\n\nIn late 2014, the Kurds were struggling to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.", "description": "* Mike Pence strikes deal with Turkish president in Ankara  * Agreement appears to cement key Turkish objectivesThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has agreed with the US vice-president, Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation on Kurdish-led forces in north-east Syria for the next five days", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan In Istanbul", "Julian Borger In Washington"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qFvOwV6ZSzM7uudprI0.yA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/fee25a84576218553834f7b0963386ea", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
