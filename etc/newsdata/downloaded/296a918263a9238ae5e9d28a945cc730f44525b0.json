Uncertainty over who starts at fly-half is a concern, but Samu Kerevi has evolved from a one-track basher into a centre of the highest quality, and has rightly been rewarded with the vice captaincy.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Hooper will likely be reunited with David Pocock (if fit) after four years of injuries and sabbaticals that has seen the pair seldom deployed in tandem since the last World Cup. Australia are undoubtedly a better side with the pair dovetailing in the back row, but figuring out how exactly to fit them both without compromising the line out or leaving the side short of carriers remains a quandary.\n\nElsewhere, the \u2018Tongan Thor\u2019 Taniela Tupou will be sprung from the bench and provide destructive cameos on the tighthead, and look out for 19-year-old livewire Jordan Petaia \u2013 that Petaia, who has not yet made his Australia debut, has made this side after two injury hit seasons is a mark of how highly the Australian set-up regards the young wing, whose long-term home may be outside centre. With a wise head on extremely young shoulders and an ability to glide past and through tackles, Petaia could be a breakout star of the tournament if he gets an opportunity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That 47-26 win over New Zealand somewhat calmed troubled waters for Cheika, a divisive figure throughout his five-year tenure. It is a flawed side, and Cheika has done well to bring back seven or eight from Europe who will make a difference in Japan, but the nilling the Wallabies received as a measure of revenge from the All Blacks exposed all too easily Australia\u2019s flaws.\n\nWith selection decisions to be made at a number of positions, most prominently in the back row and at fly-half, Cheika will have to get his combinations right if Australia are to truly assemble themselves for a run at the trophy.\n\nKey Player\n\nMichael Hooper. There is a little bit of chatter that Hooper may find himself starting on the bench with David Pocock fit again, but the Australia captain is such a key cog to this side that he must start with his athleticism in the open field vital to the Wallabies\u2019 defensive structures, his breakdown business equally crucial in spoiling opposition ball and his leadership hugely important.\n\nHooper will have to figure out how he and Pocock can combine most effectively and integrate the third member of their back row triumvirate. There are plenty of older heads in the Australia squad to guide and assist Hooper, but he will need to take charge of his team and set standards to ensure consistency.\n\nPast Record\n\nAustralia/New Zealand 1987 \u2013 fourth place\n\nEurope 1991 \u2013 WINNERS\n\nSouth Africa 1995 \u2013 quarter-finalists\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 WINNERS\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 runners-up\n\nFrance 2007 \u2013 quarter-finalists\n\nNew Zealand 2011 - third place\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 runners-up\n\nPrediction\n\nA shock defeat to Fiji first up is followed by a tight loss to Wales, and Australia fail to make the quarter-finals of a Rugby World Cup for the first time.\n\nFixtures\n\nSaturday 21 September \u2013 Australia vs Fiji (5.45am), Sapporo\n\nSunday 29 September \u2013 Australia vs Wales (8.45am), Tokyo\n\nSaturday 5 October \u2013 Australia vs Uruguay (6.15am), Oita\n\nFriday 11 October \u2013 Australia vs Georgia (11.15am), Shizuoka\n\nOdds\n\nAustralia to win the World Cup: 14/1", "description": "Australia\u00a0have made the quarter-finals of every Rugby World Cup, but it is 20 years since they last lifted the Webb Ellis Cup.
