Yet an increase in high-price stocks and automated trading programs drove a surge in odd-lot exchanges. The proportion of trades in that size reached a record 48.9% on October 7 and has stayed above 40% since, according to WSJ.\n\nWhile no S&P 500 companies traded above $1,000 per share in 2012, five now do, including Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The record-long bull market has inflated the rest of the market, with the average price of stocks in the S&P 500 more than tripling since 2009, according to Strategas Research data cited by WSJ.\n\nThe move to higher prices leads investors to have to hand over more upfront for trades involving multiples of 100 shares, also known as \"round lot\" trades.\n\nRead more: 'A license to print money': A former chemical engineer and Ph.D. with no market experience now makes a living day-trading full time. Here's his 3-step process to finding that one successful trade that makes his day.\n\nThe influx of technology and programming into the once trader-dominated stock market has also driven up the popularity of odd-lot exchanges.\n\nAlgorithmic trading often divides large sales or purchases into smaller segments to spread out a trade and avoid a large price change that could alert other investors. Though banks used to cut large trades into round-lot exchanges, they're increasingly using odd-lot trades for segmented orders, according to WSJ.\n\n\"We now live in a world of algos and slicing and dicing,\" Cornell University finance professor Maureen O'Hara told WSJ.\n\nThe shift from round-lot trades presents a few issues in the slow-to-change world of market regulation. For instance, odd-lot quotes aren't shown on public data feeds, allowing the small trades to go hidden from many investors' fields of view.\n\nBrokers also face challenges born from the shift to odd-lots. The firms are obligated to execute trades at the best price posted on an exchange, but the prices are taken only by round-lot quotes. Best price quotes could become less accurate if the trend continues, as odd-lot trades would account for more of a stock's price movement.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nElizabeth Warren grilled Treasury Secretary Mnuchin about the billions the Fed has injected into the market \u2014 and warned him against easing bank regulations\n\nDel Taco trumpeted the 'unique appeal' of Beyond Meat products in May \u2014 but sales are under pressure\n\nA new McKinsey report says that it's a 'do or die moment' for many banks.
