Think about this. He went to Indiana with everyone knowing he was one-and-done. He took a huge gamble playing with that injury because it could have hurt his draft status more than it already did. Let's put it this way. He had a lot - a lot - more to lose by playing than gain. He didn't care. He wanted to be there for those guys because he knew he was gone after one year. The Celtics got a kid who is a lot tougher than people realize.\"\n\nSince getting the green light to resume full contact, Langford's teammates said he has made up for the lost time with some impressive play during pick-up games at the practice facility prior to the start of training camp.\n\nFellow rookie Carsen Edwards has been competing with Langford for years on the prep basketball scene in addition to last season when Edwards was at Purdue and Langford played for Indiana.\n\n\"He's a scorer, man,\" Edwards told NBC Sports Boston's Kyle Draper regarding Langford. \"He can score at all three levels, whether that's mid-range, the 3 or get to the rim. He's real athletic, long arms, can finish around big guys and take off from outside the paint and finish. He has a good feel for the game.\"\n\nAnd a good work ethic, evident by his longer-than-necessary hours spent following his first practice.\n\nMore than anything, he wants to be as ready as possible when his number is called.\n\n\"I'm a team player. I do whatever is called for me to do when I get out on the floor,\" Langford said. \"Whatever minutes I get, I'm going to give it all I got.\"\n\nIn the past, Langford's dynamic play has been in stark contrast to his low-key demeanor.\n\nHow much of a contrast we see this year, remains to be seen.\n\n\"I'm not the most \u2026 outgoing person,\" Langford said before breaking into a slight smile, \"but I'm definitely not quiet once you get to know me.\"\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
