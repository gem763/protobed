This discussion includes possibly blocking all U.S. financial investments in Chinese companies, the source said.\n\nIt's in the preliminary stages and nothing has been decided, the source said. There's also no time frame for their implementation, the source added.\n\nRestricting financial investments in Chinese entities would be meant to protect U.S. investors from excessive risk due to lack of regulatory supervision, the source said.\n\nThe deliberations come as the U.S. looks for additional levers of influence in trade talks, which resume on Oct. 10 in Washington. Both countries slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods. The discussions also come as the Chinese government is taking steps to increase foreign access to its markets.", "description": "The discussion is in its preliminary stages and nothing has been decided, CNBC's source says.", "authors": ["Eamon Javers Yun Li", "Eamon Javers", "Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105994815-1561767951107gettyimages-1152490658.jpeg?v=1561768017", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
