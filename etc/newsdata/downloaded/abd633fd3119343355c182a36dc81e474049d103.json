Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nWe just found out that U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr is doing some real legwork on probing the origins of the Russia investigation. The Washington Post reported Monday that he has traveled to Britain and Italy to secure help from those governments. He has also gotten President Trump to request similar cooperation from Australia.\n\nThe fact that Barr is going to such great lengths on this task is one thing. But what is he even after in those countries?\n\nThe answer suggests the investigation is chasing down some pretty bold conspiracy theories.\n\nBelow is a look at how each country could figure in to the investigation and what the prevailing theory might be inside Trump- and Barr-world.\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison shake hands during a visit to a Pratt Industries plant opening in Ohio in September. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThis is the most obvious one. The Mueller report states that the initial FBI investigation of potential collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was launched shortly after a tip from a \u201cforeign country\u201d \u2014 a country news reports have identified as Australia.\n\nBasically, a London-based Maltese professor with ties to Russia, Joseph Mifsud, told Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. Then Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in London, Alexander Downer, that he had received word that the Russian government could help the Trump campaign by releasing the information anonymously.\n\nThe conspiracy theory, which began with Papadopoulos but took some time to germinate even in conservative media circles, is that Mifsud was an agent of a Western government or even a CIA asset and that he set up Papadopoulos.\n\nPapadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to investigators, has alleged the whole thing amounted to a setup and that he had been \u201centrapped.\u201d Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has said it was a \u201ccounterintelligence trap.\u201d Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has said, \u201cWhen you look into Mifsud closer, you realize he\u2019s connected with all kinds of intelligence agencies, including our own FBI.\u201d\n\nIntelligence officials have rejected the idea as baseless and noted that the CIA is prohibited by law from targeting Americans.\n\nAustralia figures in this, too, because Papadopoulos has suggested Downer was part of the setup. \u201cWhat I believe he was doing was spying on me,\u201d Papadopoulos told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. in May. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I was there being interrogated and profiled by an intelligence officer \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what I left that meeting thinking.\u201d\n\nBy obtaining Australian cooperation, Barr could be probing this particular conspiracy theory.\n\nBritain\n\nBritain obviously figures into the above, given that the meetings took place there. Relatedly, it was also where another professor, Stefan A. Halper, reached out to three Trump campaign sources in 2016 to discuss foreign policy. Halper around the same time began serving as a source in the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nBut there\u2019s another major way in which it could play into theories about the Russia probe\u2019s origins: the Steele dossier.\n\nThe dossier was assembled by a former British intelligence operative, Christopher Steele, initially for conservative opponents of Trump and later for Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents. The Trump team has made dubious allegations that the dossier launched the Russia investigation \u2014 despite the government having been alerted to it months after the FBI probe got off the ground. The implication was that the Russia probe was based upon the dossier\u2019s largely unproved and unverified claims.\n\nNunes has also argued in his eponymous memo that the FBI used the dossier as a bogus pretext for surveilling another former Trump foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, and suggested the government obscured the dossier\u2019s partisan associations. (This claim doesn\u2019t exactly check out, though, given that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application to surveil Page included a lengthy footnote explaining that the information was funded by political interests.)\n\nInvolving Britain could be aimed at learning more about Steele and his work. Trump himself has also promoted the conspiracy theory that the United Kingdom was \u201cbaiting the United States into taking a hard line against\u201d Russia \u2014 apparently by falsifying information.\n\nHere\u2019s what he retweeted in March:\n\n\n\nScreenshot via Twitter (Screenshot/Twitter)\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether British officials are interested in entertaining such conspiracy theories about themselves.\n\nItaly\n\nOf the three countries, this is perhaps the least obviously tied to the Russia investigation. But it reinforces the apparent interest in the Mifsud conspiracy theory, and Barr has visited there twice.\n\nMifsud was born in Malta but educated in Italy. Giuliani has accused him of being a \u201ccounterintelligence operative, either Maltese or Italian.\u201d Papadopoulos has hailed Barr\u2019s travel to Italy, saying it holds the \u201ckeys to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nAG Barr has been on official travel in Italy for the past two days. As I explained months ago, on Fox and in my book, Mifsud was an Italian operative handled by the CIA. Italy holds the keys to the kingdom. Right government, right time. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 \u2014 George Papadopoulos (@GeorgePapa19) September 27, 2019\n\nMifsud was last seen working as a visiting professor in Rome in 2017, but he has since disappeared. Perhaps Barr is trying to find out what happened to him or to locate him for questioning related to the above theories.\n\nWhatever the case, the focus on the three countries above suggests Barr and the U.S. attorney in charge of the probe, John Durham, are very much checking into Giuliani\u2019s and Papadopoulos\u2019s conspiracy theories. You could also lump Ukraine in with the three, as Trump has pressed its president to pursue a separate investigation that suggests Russia might not be behind the 2016 election interference. But in that case, the Justice Department has denied Barr\u2019s involvement.\n\nWhatever the case, it\u2019s a remarkable shift from when Papadopoulos was shouting these ideas into the void not so long ago.", "description": "The three countries Barr is reportedly leaning on are united by one big conspiracy theory.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/46UgQ8YboH_Zyalck8Gyh9Pmx-4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QLKCK7HBDQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
