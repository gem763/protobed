The new Prime Minister, for example, recognised the importance of faster broadband speeds in his acceptance speech, and has pledged to deliver full-fibre broadband to every home in the UK by 2025.'\n\nThe Government has been focusing on the rollout of superfast broadband for nearly 10 years now, which, according to Ofcom, is now available in 95 per cent of the UK.\n\nHowever, only 7 per cent of the UK have access to full-fibre networks meaning most will be left without a reliable superfast broadband connection.\n\nThe Government is prioritising city centres, towns and businesses with a complete full-fibre rollout target of 2033.\n\nThis means, however, those in rural communities will likely have to wait much longer for reliable access to superfast broadband, potentially slowing down economic growth in these areas.\n\nPocock added: 'To protect the productivity of the UK workforce, it's vital that we continue to put pressure on councils and the Government to achieve this goal. Indeed, of the four hundred UK council websites and Ofcom reports we looked at, in many areas those councils have failed to meet their own targets and hit their deadlines.\n\n'All that said, households could make a significant impact on their speeds right now by shopping around for the best deals and knowing what speeds they are entitled to in the first place.'", "description": "Whilst the UK's average download speed is 54.2Mbps, Hull is working at an average of a massive 87Mbps, according to new data from Broadband Choices.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
