A frequently cited example is the recipe for Coca-Cola.\n\nOnce an invention is the subject of a patent, it is no longer considered a trade secret because patent applications are publicly available documents.\n\nA company with a cutting-edge technology will sometimes claim the invention is a trade secret rather than file for patent protection. Patents eventually expire and make the invention part of the public domain, but trade secret protection can last indefinitely, or at least as long as the information remains confidential.\n\nAre civil disputes over trade secrets common?\n\nIt is quite common for companies to sue rivals for alleged trade secrets theft. In 2017, there were more than 1,100 such civil cases filed in U.S. federal courts, according to litigation analytics company Lex Machina.\n\nFormer Google and Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski leaves the federal court after his arraignment hearing in San Jose, California, U.S. August 27, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nOccasionally, an alleged theft will be subject of both a civil lawsuit and a criminal prosecution.\n\nIn one such example, U.S. prosecutors earlier this year unsealed an indictment charging units of China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd with conspiring to steal T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) trade secrets. T-Mobile brought a civil lawsuit years earlier making identical claims.\n\nAre criminal trade secrets prosecutions also common?\n\nCriminal cases involving trade secrets theft are less common than civil ones, but have been increasing in recent years, legal experts said.\n\nThe FBI had 67 pending investigations relating to theft of trade secrets as of October 2018, according to a U.S. government report.\n\nCriminal prosecutions often focus on trade secrets that involve national security and recently have targeted Chinese nationals who worked in the United States. Prosecutors also feel pressure to act in high-profile domestic cases involving important technology, legal experts said.\n\nIn both civil and criminal cases, frequently companies or prosecutors claim that an employee was planning to leave and improperly downloaded documents containing trade secrets, later providing them to their new company.\n\nWhat are Levandowski\u2019s potential defenses?\n\nTo prevail, prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Waymo files at issue actually contained trade secrets. Prosecutors also need to show that these trade secrets were improperly acquired and disclosed by Levandowski.\n\nLevandowski could argue that the Waymo\u2019s designs did not qualify as trade secrets because the company did not take reasonable steps to safeguard them or because they were widely known.\n\nLevandowski could also argue that he lacked the intent to steal anything.\n\nLevandowski\u2019s lawyers foreshadowed such a defense in their statement, saying the downloads occurred when he was authorized to use the information and that \u201cnone of these supposedly secret files ever went to Uber or to any other company.\u201d\n\nFormer Google and Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski walks to an awaiting vehicle after his arraignment hearing at the federal court in San Jose, California, U.S. August 27, 2019.

Levandowski would likely face a shorter sentence if he agreed to plead guilty rather than defend himself at a trial.", "description": "U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday brought a criminal case against a former high-ranking Google engineer, alleging he stole confidential technology from the company's self-driving car unit before joining rival Uber Technologies Inc .", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190828&t=2&i=1423478422&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7R05B"}
