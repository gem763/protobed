AFP/Getty\n\nThe New York Times assembled a large body of evidence to analyse the hospital bombings on 5-6 May.\n\nSocial media posts from Syria, interviews with witnesses, and records from charities that supported the four hospitals provided the approximate time of each strike. The New York Times obtained logs kept by flight spotters on the ground who warn civilians about incoming airstrikes and cross-checked the time of each strike to confirm that Russian warplanes were overhead. The New York Times then listened to and deciphered thousands of Russian Air Force radio transmissions, which recorded months\u2019 worth of pilot activities in the skies above northwestern Syria. The recordings were provided by a network of observers who insisted on anonymity for their safety.\n\nSpotter logs from 5-6 May put Russian pilots above each hospital at the time they were struck, and Air Force audio recordings from that day feature Russian pilots confirming each bombing. Videos obtained from witnesses and verified by The New York Times confirmed three of the strikes.\n\nRecklessly or intentionally bombing hospitals is a war crime, but proving culpability amid a complex civil war is extremely difficult, and until now, Syrian medical workers and human rights groups lacked proof.\n\nRussia\u2019s position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shielded it from scrutiny and made UN agencies reluctant to accuse the Russian Air Force of responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on health in Syria, as well as the indiscriminate bombing of civilian facilities, are definitely war crimes, and they should be prosecuted at the level of the International Criminal Court in The Hague,\u201d said Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at Physicians for Human Rights. But Russia and China \u201cshamefully\u201d vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have referred those and other crimes in Syria to the court, she said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Instead, a Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed to past statements saying that the Russian Air Force carries out precision strikes only on \u201caccurately researched targets.\u201d\n\nThe UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, opened an investigation into the hospital bombings in August. The investigation, still ongoing, is meant in part to determine why hospitals that voluntarily added their locations to a UN-sponsored deconfliction list, which was provided to Russia and other combatants to prevent them from being attacked, nevertheless came under attack.\n\nSyrian health care workers said they believed the UN list actually became a target menu for Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nStephane Dujarric, a spokesman for the secretary-general, said in September that the investigation \u2014 an internal board of inquiry \u2014 would not produce a public report or identify \u201clegal responsibility.\u201d Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian permanent representative to the UN, cast doubt on the process shortly after it was announced, saying he hoped the inquiry would not investigate perpetrators but rather what he said was the UN\u2019s use of false information in its deconfliction process.\n\nFrom 29 April to mid-September, as Russian and Syrian government forces assaulted the last rebel pocket in the northwest, 54 hospitals and clinics in opposition territory were attacked, the UN human rights office said. At least seven had tried to protect themselves by adding their location to the deconfliction list, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nOn 5-6 May, Russia attacked four. All were on the list.\n\nThe first was Nabad al Hayat Surgical Hospital, a major underground trauma centre in southern Idlib province serving about 200,000 people. The hospital performed on average around 500 operations and saw more than 5,000 patients a month, according to Syria Relief and Development, the US-based charity that supported it.\n\nNabad al Hayat had been attacked three times since it opened in 2013 and had recently relocated to an underground complex on agricultural land, hoping to be protected from airstrikes.\n\nAt 2:32pm on 5 May, a Russian ground control officer can be heard in an Air Force transmission providing a pilot with a longitude and latitude that correspond to Nabad al Hayat\u2019s exact location.\n\nAt 2:38pm, the pilot reports that he can see the target and has the \u201ccorrection,\u201d code for locking the target on a screen in his cockpit. Ground control responds with the green light for the strike, saying, \u201cThree sevens.\u201d\n\nAt the same moment, a flight spotter on the ground logs a Russian jet circling in the area.\n\nAt 2:40pm, the same time the charity said that Nabad al Hayat was struck, the pilot confirms the release of his weapons, saying, \u201cWorked it.\u201d Seconds later, local journalists filming the hospital in anticipation of an attack record three precision bombs penetrating the roof of the hospital and blowing it out from the inside in geysers of dirt and concrete.\n\nThe staff of Nabad al Hayat had evacuated three days earlier after receiving warnings and anticipating a bombing, but Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital, 3 miles northwest, was not as lucky.\n\nA doctor who worked there said that the hospital was struck four times, beginning at 5:30pm. The strikes landed about five minutes apart, without warning, he said, killing a man who was standing outside and forcing patients and members of the medical staff to use oxygen tanks to breathe through the choking dust.\n\nA spotter logged a Russian jet circling above at the time of the strike, and in another Russian Air Force transmission, a pilot reports that he has \u201cworked\u201d his target at 5:30pm, the time of the strike. He then reports three more strikes, each about five minutes apart, matching the doctor\u2019s chronology.\n\nRussian pilots bombed two other hospitals in the same 12-hour span: Kafr Zita Cave Hospital and Al Amal Orthopedic Hospital. In both cases, spotters recorded Russian Air Force jets in the skies at the time of the strike, and Russian pilots can be heard in radio transmissions \u201cworking\u201d their targets at the times the strikes were reported.\n\nSince 5 May, at least two dozen hospitals and clinics in the rebel-held northwest have been hit by airstrikes. Syrian medical workers said they expected hospital bombings to continue, given the inability of the UN and other countries to find a way to hold Russia to account.\n\n\u201cThe argument by the Russians or the regime is always that hospitals are run by terrorists,\u201d said Nabad al Hayat\u2019s head nurse, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared being targeted. \u201cIs it really possible that all the people are terrorists?\n\n\u201cThe truth is that after hospitals are hit, and in areas like this where there is just one hospital, our houses have become hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar\u00a0al-Assad, according to an investigation by The New York Times.", "authors": ["Christiaan Triebert", "Evan Hill"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/09/syria-hospital-kafr-nabl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
