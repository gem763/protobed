Chappelle grew up outside Washington in Silver Spring, Maryland and attended Washington\u2019s Duke Ellington High School for the performing arts.\n\n\u201cGoing there was one of the great privileges of my life,\u201d he said on the red carpet as he headed in to accept his Mark Twain prize for lifetime achievement in American comedy. \u201cDC in the 80s was turbulent and I met a bunch of young black artists who taught me it was ok to be different. It was ok to be weird.\u201d\n\nRapper and actor Common paid tribute to Chappelle\u2019s bravery and sociological influence.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beacon for a lot of different progressive thought,\u201d he said as he entered the Kennedy Center Sunday night. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a leader in thought and culture. He says provocative things and I respect that. He brings uncomfortable things up and now we have to discuss it.
