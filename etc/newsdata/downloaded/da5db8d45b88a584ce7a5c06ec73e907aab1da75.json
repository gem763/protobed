Netanyahu is expected to receive 55.\n\nThose totals do not include ex-defence minister Avigdor Lieberman's nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, which won eight seats.\n\nLieberman, who could potentially play a kingmaker role, said Sunday he will not endorse either Netanyahu or Gantz for now.\n\nLieberman has insisted on a unity government between his party, Netanyahu's right-wing Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White.\n\nHe said he could not for now back Netanyahu because the premier is willing to form a coalition with Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, which he accuses of seeking to impose religious law on the secular population.\n\nLieberman also said he could not back Gantz for now because he may reach a deal with either the ultra-Orthodox or Israel's Arab parties, which he called \"enemies.\"\n\nFaced with disappointing results, Netanyahu last week acknowledged he was unable to form the right-wing coalition that he had hoped for and called on Gantz to join him in a unity government.\n\nBut Gantz, who has also called for a unity government, made his position clear: He must be prime minister under any such arrangement, since his party has the most seats.\n\nRivlin would \"make every effort to prevent a third set of elections,\" Harel Tubi, director general of the president's office, told Israel's army radio on Sunday.\n\n\"The consultations will include new offers that the public has yet to hear.\"\n\nThe end of the Netanyahu era would be an extraordinary moment in Israeli politics.\n\nHe has been prime minister for a record-breaking total of more than 13 years.\n\nBut the 69-year-old faces potential corruption charges in the weeks ahead, pending a hearing set for early October.\n\nGantz has in the past spoken of his refusal to serve in a government with an indicted prime minister.\n\nHe has not repeated that demand in recent days, beyond saying he should be premier himself.", "description": "Israeli Arab political parties broke with longstanding precedent Sunday and endorsed ex-military chief Benny Gantz for prime minister following last week's elections, seeking to keep the president from asking incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu to form the next government.
