According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the murder rate in the United States fell by 6.8 percent between 2017 and 2018, meaning that more than 1,000 fewer Americans died from homicide during the first full year of President Trump in office than in the last full year of President Obama in office.\n\nBut the sharp decline in murders is just part of this encouraging news. The destructive crime wave that first materialized in 2014 is finally receding, with the overall violent crime rate shrinking by 3.9 percent last year. Notably, the two categories with the largest decreases were robbery and burglary, indicating that the abundance of opportunity in the economy is likely making people safer as well as more prosperous.\n\nMake no mistake, this sizable reduction in crime is no coincidence. It is a result of the multifaceted approach this administration has taken on criminal justice, which involves empathetic efforts to tackle the root causes of crime and pragmatic measures to ensure that police officers are able to do their jobs safely and efficiently.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn stark contrast to his predecessor, for instance, President Trump has openly praised our brave men and women in blue, giving our nation\u2019s law enforcement officers the support and protection they need to keep American communities safe. That sort of presidential encouragement was sorely lacking under President Obama, who praised violent anti-police groups such as Black Lives Matter and even turned a blind eye to the spate of police killings that took place in the final years of his administration.\n\nPresident Trump pledged in 2017 \u201cto restore law and order and justice for all Americans, and we\u2019re going to do it quickly,\u201d adding that he firmly stands with the families of police officers killed in the line of duty. Since then, President Trump has faithfully kept his promise to law enforcement. Soon after taking office, he signed an executive order specifically designed to prevent violence \u201cagainst federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement officers\u201d by developing new strategies to combat crime against police and pursuing legislation to enhance the penalties for committing acts of violence against law enforcement officers.\n\nThe President has also issued several executive orders aimed at strengthening our immigration system by improving the screening and vetting protocols of the United States Refugee Admissions Program to ensure that we detect potential terrorists before they enter the country. More importantly, President Trump overcame Democrat obstruction in Congress to secure funding for construction of new physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a vital part of his ongoing strategy to combat the multinational human smuggling and drug trafficking operations that exploit our weak immigration laws, as well as the violent gangs that terrorize American communities. The Supreme Court has upheld that action, and we are now on pace to construct about 450 miles of new border wall by the end of next year.\n\nThose are all good reasons to expect further reductions in violent crime over the coming months and years, but they only represent one side of the coin. In addition to strengthening the capabilities of law enforcement, the President recently renovated our entire criminal justice system, correcting many long-standing inequities with the most ambitious prison reform package in generations.\n\nThe First Step Act \u2014 which was signed into law earlier this year \u2014 aims to reduce recidivism by better preparing non-violent inmates for life after prison through programs that teach the life and career skills to enable former inmates to provide for themselves without returning to a life of crime. At the same time, the legislation also reformed outdated federal sentencing guidelines that disproportionately affected minorities and created a pathway to earlier release for inmates who have demonstrated good behavior and a genuine desire to reform.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll of this has been a tremendous boon for the African American community. Historically, blacks have been disproportionately impacted by violent crime \u2014 in 2015, for instance, African Americans accounted for 51 percent of all homicide victims despite constituting just 13 percent of the population. By reducing the murder rate, the President is saving hundreds of black lives across America.\n\nWhen Donald Trump promised to be \u201cthe law and order\u201d candidate in 2016, he vowed to implement a strategy that would significantly reduce violence and crime across the country. By keeping that promise, he\u2019s been saving thousands of American lives, a trend that will continue under his leadership and with his ongoing support for law enforcement in America.\n\nMadison Gesiotto is an attorney and a commentator who serves with the advisory board of the Donald Trump campaign.
