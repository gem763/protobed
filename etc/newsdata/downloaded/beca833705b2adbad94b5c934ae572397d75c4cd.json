Luc Pettavino, president of the Association Mon\u00e9gasque contre les Myopathies, which supports scientific and medical research on DMD, and former organizer of the Monaco Yacht Show, founded the auction in 2005 after his late son Paul was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be angry or to feel like a victim when my wife and I discovered our son Paul had Duchenne muscular dystrophy,\u201d Pettavino said in a message on the Christie\u2019s website. \u201cI needed an idea through which we could raise a lot of money. I wanted to have what I hoped would be a consistent amount of money to plough into research.\u201d\n\nPettavino underscores that the pieces are auctioned without fees and that neither he nor the brands receive any financial compensation. As it embarks on its eighth edition, Only Watch and its supporting brands have raised almost $40 million with 100% of the funds going toward finding a cure.\n\nWith an estimate of about US$2.5 million to US$3 million, Lot 28 is by far the most valuable. Patek Philippe\u2019s super-complicated Grandmaster Chime reference 6300A-010 will be the first and only Grandmaster Chime ever produced in stainless steel, making it a coveted collector\u2019s piece.\n\nCreated to mark the brand\u2019s 175th anniversary in 2014, the Grandmaster Chime features a remarkable 20 complications, including the brand\u2019s first grande sonnerie in a wristwatch. Other chiming modes include a petite sonnerie, a minute repeater, and two patented world firsts: an acoustic alarm that strikes a preselected time and a date repeater that sounds the date on demand.\n\n\u201cThe steel case allow the grand-sonnerie to literally \u2018sing\u2019 in a way I have never heard a Patek before,\u201d says John Reardon, Senior International Consultant, Christie\u2019s Watches. \u201cThe metal and size of the watch allows magic to happen in terms of the sound.\u201d\n\nThe watch\u2019s special two-sided case swivels back and forth so you can choose to show the Time side in rose gold with a hand-guilloch\u00e9d hobnail center or the Calendar side in black ebony inscribed with the words: The Only One. \u201cWhat surprises me is the use of the words 'The Only One' on the dial,\u201d Reardon says. \u201cWe have never seen this before and will never see it again.\u201d\n\nDe Bethune and Urwerk have teamed up to create the Moon Satellite. Christie's\n\nCreative independent brands De Bethune and Urwerk have teamed up to create the Moon Satellite, merging signature mechanisms and aesthetic codes from each. The visionaries behind both brands collaborated on the one-off URDB01 caliber developed for the auction. The mirror-polished blued titanium case\u2019s floating lugs, crown positioned at 12 o\u2019clock, and high-precision spherical moon phase point to its De Bethune lineage, while the unorthodox case design and radical satellite time indication channel the sci-fi essence of Urwerk. Lot 15 is estimated to sell for about US$120,866 to US$151,083.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of collaboration between these two great independents can be felt when one holds the watch,\u201d Reardon says. \u201cIf you are a fan of innovation and technical prowess, this is the watch for you, and Only Watch is quite fortunate to be the catalyst of such a historical collaboration.\u201d\n\nOther highlights include F.P. Journe\u2019s Astronomic Blue with a prototype movement and tantalum case estimated to sell for about US$300,000 to US$400,000 and a mixed-metal version of Audemars Piguet\u2019s new Code 11.59 by Audemars Piguet Tourbillon Openworked in white and pink gold with an estimate of about US$190,000 to US$240,000.\n\nWhile most of the watches fall in the five- and six-figure range, Tudor\u2019s trendy Black Bay Ceramic One, Lot. 44, has an approachable estimate of about US$4,400 to US$5,500. The very first ceramic Black Bay looks particularly modern and stealthy in all matte black.\n\nFrom New York, the exhibition will move on to Asia\u2014Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taipei\u2014before returning to Geneva for the auction on Nov. 9 at the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues.", "description": "Leading the sale to benefit Duchenne muscular dystrophy research is a Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime, estimated at US$2.5 million to US$3 million", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-117747/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
