When SPCA staff take Waffles from the stall for treatment, Hemingway will display \"protective behaviors,\" she said.\n\n\"He'll honk and flap his wings and let you know, 'Hey leave my buddy alone,' or 'You better bring him back,'\" Kelly said. \"They really seem to have this bond.\"\n\nBecause of Waffles and Hemingway's close bond, Bucks County SPCA officials have decided to make them adoptable together only. Their adoption donation is $300 for the pair, according to Kelly.\n\nCourtesy Bucks County SPCA\n\nCourtesy Bucks County SPCA\n\n\"What's important with animals in a shelter setting is minimizing stress,\" she said. \"You don't want to separate animals like this because they really have a bond.\"\n\nWaffles and Hemingway came to the SPCA with their names. Officials do not know how long they have been farm friends, according to Kelly.\n\nOnce Waffles is cleared by doctors, he and Hemingway will go up for adoption. The Bucks County SPCA has already posted on its website the application to adopt the two animals because of the \"overwhelming\" response.\n\n\"We'll make appointments so potential adopters can come and meet the animals,\" said Kelly, noting they're looking for adopters who live in an area zoned for animals, are experienced with farm animals and are able to provide well for the animals. \"Hopefully we'll find someone soon so they have a permanent home.\"", "description": "The unlikely friends were rescued from property in Pennsylvania in July.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/waffles-hemingway-miniature-horse-goose-friends-01-ht-jc-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
