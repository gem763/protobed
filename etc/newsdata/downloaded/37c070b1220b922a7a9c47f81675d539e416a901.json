MacArthur Foundation\u2019s so-called \u201cgenius\u201d fellowship grants are awarded annually to individuals, not institutions, to \u201cpursue their own creative, intellectual, and professional inclinations,\u201d according to the foundation. Criteria for the awards include \u201cexceptional creativity\u201d the \u201cpromise for important future advances based on a track record of significant accomplishments,\u201d and a potential to produce new work. The foundation has named 1,040 geniuses since 1981.\n\nThe grants are not conditional or relative to specific projects, however; the quarterly stipend supports recipients\u2019 abilities to \u201cexercise their own creative instincts for the benefit of human society.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cFrom addressing the consequences of climate change to furthering our understanding of human behaviour to fusing forms of artistic expression, this year\u2019s 26 extraordinary MacArthur Fellows demonstrate the power of individual creativity to reframe old problems, spur reflection, create new knowledge, and better the world for everyone\", MacArthur president John Palfrey said in a statement. \u201cThey give us reason for hope, and they inspire us all to follow our own creative instincts.\u201d\n\nFellows include geochemist and paleoclimatologist Andrea Dutton and theoretical geophysicist Jerry X Mitrovica, whose works explore sea level rise, and marine scientist Stacy Jupiter, who studies conservation strategies to protect ecosystems and coastal communities.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Oceana is rebuilding abundant and biodiverse oceans by winning science-based policies in countries that control one-third of the world\u2019s wild fish catch. With over 200 victories that stop overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution and killing of threatened species like turtles and sharks, Oceana\u2019s campaigns are delivering results.

Reteti is part of the Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy and is the first community-owned and run elephant sanctuary in Africa. The Matthews Range where Namunyak is situated is home to Africa's second-largest elephant population. Community-based wildlife keepers there are working to rehabilitate abandoned and orphaned elephants in order to eventually return them to the nearby wild herds. Amy Vitale 7/14 PhotoVoice It is hard enough to be a Lesbian, Bisexual and Queer (LBQ) woman in Uganda, but to be HIV+ too, we face double discrimination. Many hide their pain in alcohol and drug abuse. Discrimination from the community leads to self-stigmatisation and we struggle to access the services and support we need. Even the LGBTI community see us as a problem, and turn us away so that we become someone else's problem. By understanding our mental health needs and providing effective support, HIV+ LBQ women can lead healthy lives.

This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. Reticulated giraffes themselves number fewer than 16,000 individuals. Scientists are now undertaking major studies to better understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done to stop it.

None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust community conservancies had been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use, grazing programs, and endangered species conservation. Indigenous communities are the frontlines of the poaching wars.
