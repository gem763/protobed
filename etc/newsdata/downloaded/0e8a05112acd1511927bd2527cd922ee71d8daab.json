Since Apple first released its smart assistant, Siri, in spring 2011, competitors like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have followed suit with their own virtual assistants.\n\nWhile there are a set of standard skills that you can safely find in nearly any smart assistant \u2014 such as searching the internet or setting a timer \u2014 not all smart assistants are the same.\n\nAnd recent additions to Google's assistant may just give it a competitive edge that other smart assistants lack.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nGoogle Assistant, explained\n\nThe latest evolution of the smart assistant Google originally launched in 2012, Google Assistant is the tech company's AI-powered smart assistant.\n\nIn a playful nod to their search engine, Google markets Google Assistant as a user's \"personal Google\" \u2014 built to help them navigate their own busy lives the way Google might help them navigate a busy web.\n\nNative to most Android phones, as well as Google Home devices, Google Assistant allows users to use both voice and text commands.\n\nWhere you can use Google Assistant\n\nFor users with an Android phone or a Google Home, all that's needed to summon Google Assistant is saying \"OK Google\" or \"Hey Google,\" and the assistant will pop up at the bottom of your screen. Or for Pixel phone users, simply squeezing the bottom of your phone will work as well.\n\nFor iPhone users, it's as simple as downloading the Google Assistant app. From there, users can connect the assistant with their primary Google account to give it access to their calendar and important emails \u2014 like restaurant or flight reservations.\n\nGoogle Assistant will give a few recommendations of things you can ask it. Sarah Wells/Business Insider\n\nThanks to its integration with Android devices and Google accounts, users can also use Google Assistant when away from their Google Home or even their phones.\n\nGoogle Assistant is compatible with Android Auto vehicles, wearables like Google's smartwatch and Pixel Buds, Nest security products, and a variety of non-Google smart displays. These devices also all respond to the standard \"OK Google\" or \"Hey Google\" call.\n\nWhat you can do with Google Assistant\n\nOnce Google Assistant is up and running, what exactly can you do with it?\n\nSimilar to other smart assistants, you can program Google Assistant to give you news briefings (on-demand or at scheduled times), answer questions like \"What's the weather like?\" or \"When does the sun set today?,\" and play music from Spotify, as well as YouTube Music. Users can also use Google Assistant to cast TV or movies to Chromecast TVs.\n\nGoogle Assistant will, in most cases, return its results in seconds. Sarah Wells/Business Insider\n\nWith its access to a user's Google calendar and emails, Google Assistant can also give the user a briefing on what their schedule for the day ahead looks like when asked \"Hey Google, what's my day look like?\"\n\nGoogle Assistant is also equipped with some cutting edge skills that competitors like Amazon's Alexa have yet to replicate, including its built-in interpreter.\n\nBy asking, \"Hey Google, be my Spanish interpreter\" Google Assistant can be used in real time to translate a conversation where both people are speaking a different language.\n\nFor example, if ordering a paella in Spain, Google Assistant could translate both your request to Spanish as well as the server's reply to English.\n\nUsers can also use Google Assistant to help screen calls and avoid potential scam calls.\n\nWhen receiving a phone call users can choose to answer or reject the call, like usual, or they can choose to have Google Assistant pickup the call the screen it.\n\nLike listening to someone leave a voicemail, the user can listen to Google Assistant ask why the person is calling and based on the response \u2014 genuine or seemingly from a script \u2014 can choose to pick up the call or not.\n\nYou can answer, decline, or screen the call right from your phone. Sarah Wells/Business Insider\n\nHow to optimize Google Assistant\n\nTo make sure you're getting the most out of your Google Assistant, try exploring its settings and toggling on and off extra options.\n\nFor example, in the \"My Day\" briefing on a phone running Google Assistant, you can select if you'd like to hear the weather, the news, and or a traffic report. You can also select what kind of news you'd like to hear to stop Google from playing others.\n\nAnd, as with any great assistant, part of utilizing Google Assistant is to let it take over tedious tasks to save you time.\n\nFor example, instead of fumbling to take a selfie yourself simply ask \"OK Google, take a selfie\" and the assistant will open the camera for you and set a 3-second time for the perfect picture.\n\nSimilarly, users can ask Google Assistant to turn on or off their phone's flashlight hands free.\n\nAnother unique feature to take advantage of with assistant on your smartphone is something called Lens.\n\nBy clicking the lens icon within the Google Assistant app the assistant will launch the phone's camera and help users learn more about what they're seeing.\n\nFor example, if the user points their camera at a plant or dog the assistant can pull up information on the species or breed.\n\nGoogle Lens will search the internet for whatever you focus your camera on.
