I'm terrified of it. I'm in awe of Waubgeshig for writing it. I thank him because it is the ultimate what-if novel.\"\n\nCherie Dimaline\n\n\n\nCherie Dimaline's latest book, Empire of Wild , draws inspiration from a M\u00e9tis legend. It follows Joan, a woman whose husband disappeared \u2014 only to return a year later with a new name and no memory of his past.\n\nAn essential read for Dimaline is Maria Campbell's Half-Breed \u2014 a memoir about her experience growing up on a road allowance and her challenges and triumphs along the way.\n\n\"She held all of us as a community \u2014 she protected the language and she came back home,\" Dimaline said.\n\nHarold Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson recommends The deaths of Tina Fontaine and Colten Boushie inspired former Crown prosecutor Harold Johnson to write about injustices Indigenous people have faced in the justice system, and its failure to deliver 'Peace and Good Order' to communities.Johnson recommends The Trickster Series by Eden Robinson, a thriller that follows Jared, a teen navigating adolescence with the occasional influence of magic, horror and comedy.\n\n\"It contains real magic,\" Johnson said.\n\nAlicia Elliott\n\n\n\n\n\nA \"phenomenal book\" that is top of mind for Elliott is Gwen Benaway's Mind Spread Out on the Ground is a collection of essays written by Alicia Elliott that address how colonialism and inherited legacies of trauma impact Indigenous people today.A \"phenomenal book\" that is top of mind for Elliott is Gwen Benaway's Holy Wild , a poetry collection that addresses how a trans Indigenous woman's life is impacted by dehumanization.\n\n\"[It looks at] how we can create love and beauty in those moments, despite everything,\" Elliott said.\n\nLooking for more book picks?
