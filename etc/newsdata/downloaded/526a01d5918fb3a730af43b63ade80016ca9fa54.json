And Who Nearly Did?", "language": "en", "text": "Click here to read the full article.\n\nDancing With the Stars went to the movies in its third Season 28 broadcast \u2014 and like any good film, Movie Night had its fair share of plot twists.\n\nThe episode\u2019s most notable surprise was the official withdrawal of Ray Lewis and Cheryl Burke, who were forced to drop out of Season 28 after Ray tore three tendons in his foot. (A doctor warned Ray that if he were to keep dancing, the tendon would eventually rupture, which, no thank you.)\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nBut there was a silver lining to Ray\u2019s departure: In order to even out the numbers, no one got eliminated on Monday\u2019s episode. Before you tell us who should go home next week, let\u2019s revisit the highs and lows of Movie Night:\n\nBEST OF THE NIGHT\n\nAlly Brooke and pro Sasha Farber (Rumba inspired by Selena) \u2014 Netflix has already cast Christian Serratos in their Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez bio-series\u2026 but if she needs a last-minute understudy, Ally would be the perfect fit. The Fifth Harmony singer \u2014 who has idolized Selena (and Jennifer Lopez, by extension) for years \u2014 brought so much emotion to this rumba, without ever sacrificing the passion and romance that should come with the style. (I imagine you gain a little confidence when you\u2019re wearing Selena\u2019s actual bedazzled hair clip, too.) Judges\u2019 Score: 24/30\n\nODDEST MUSICAL CHOICE\n\nHannah Brown and pro Alan Bersten (Rumba inspired by Bridesmaids) \u2014 If you\u2019re performing a Bridesmaids-inspired dance, I guess the only logical song choice is Wilson Phillips\u2019 \u201cHold On.\u201d But as Hannah said in rehearsals, the rumba is the dance of love and lust.. and all of that potential sizzle got squandered by a cheesy soundtrack, resulting in a dance that was lovely, but ultimately forgettable. Judges\u2019 Score: 21/30\n\nMOST ENTERTAINING\n\nSailor Brinkley-Cook and pro Val Chmerkovskiy (Tango) \u2014 Y\u2019all, I was totally enchanted by this tango. That opening sequence with the troupe\u2019s male dancers! That kick line! Sailor\u2019s dress! (No, seriously, where can I buy it?) I probably would have loved every second of this number, regardless of dance ability \u2014 but it sure didn\u2019t hurt that Sailor and Val also turned in season-best work. Judges\u2019 Score: 23/30\n\nMOST DISAPPOINTING\n\nKaramo Brown and pro Jenna Johnson (Jive) \u2014 Karamo has all the elements of a potential Mirrorball winner, but they have yet to align in the proper way during these live shows. On paper, Monday\u2019s jive should have been a slam dunk: It\u2019s fun! It\u2019s fast-paced! It\u2019s set to one of Elton John\u2019s best songs! In execution, though, Karamo literally could not find his footing, instead peppering the routine with missteps and wonky timing. Judges\u2019 Score: 16/30\n\nWORST OF THE NIGHT\n\nSean Spicer and pro Lindsay Arnold (Cha-Cha) \u2014 The Dancing pros are usually pretty subtle when they\u2019re giving notes to a celebrity during the performance \u2014 but Sean was so ahead of the music in the first third of this cha-cha that you could see Lindsay reminding him, \u201cSlow down! Slow down!\u201d (Amazingly, her smile never faltered during all of that.) But Sean didn\u2019t just struggle with pacing: His movements were also rigid and choppy, and that footwork was\u2026 messy. Judges\u2019 Score: 15/30 (I expected worse, to be honest! Bruno literally called this dance a \u201cdisaster blockbuster,\u201d so fives across the board actually seem\u2026 fantastic?)\n\nAs for the results, a Bottom Two was still revealed, even though no one got eliminated this time around. This week\u2019s unlucky couples were Kel and Witney and Lamar and Peta, though it\u2019s always hard to tell if those results are legit in a week when no one goes home. (That said, the hypothetical judges\u2019 save this week seems like it would have been a no-brainer.)\n\nOK, your turn!
