Jerry Nadler scheduled a House Judiciary Committee hearing designed to build support for a ban on semi-automatic firearms deemed to be \u201cassault weapons\u201d, I bet he didn\u2019t expect a 2nd Amendment activist, competitive shooter, and former law enforcement officer to end up as the star of the show. That\u2019s exactly what happened, however, when Dianna Muller of The DC Project told those on the committee that she will not comply with any future ban.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t legislate the 150 million people just like me into being criminals. It has happened. You\u2019ve already done it,\u201d Muller said, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s ban on bump stocks, the devices that use a semi-automatic weapon\u2019s recoil to make it rapidly fire like an automatic. \u201cI was a bump stock owner, and I had to make a decision: do I become a felon, or do I comply?\u201d Should the government pass an assault-weapons ban, Muller declared, \u201cI will not comply.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. As we\u2019ve pointed out here before, compliance rates for gun control laws like New Jersey\u2019s magazine ban, or New York\u2019s \u201cassault weapons\u201d registration are well below 10%, and there\u2019s no reason to believe that compliance with a federal ban on the most popular rifle in the United States would be any different.\n\nMuller\u2019s testimony was passionate, but it was also practical as well. She was simply telling lawmakers what they need to hear and don\u2019t want to admit; passing a gun control law is one thing, enforcing it is another.\n\nSadly, as is all too common when politicians get together to talk about guns, there was some stupid on display as well.\n\nSwearer also noted that some features like barrel shrouds enhance the safety of a weapon for its user. But David Chipman, senior policy adviser at the Giffords Law Center, raised a counterpoint noting that a barrel shroud could allow a shooter to get a better grip on a weapon \u201cin a way that would increase your ability to spray fire and kill more people\u201d without burning their hand.\n\nIronic to see a \u201cgun safety advocate\u201d arguing in favor of making a gun less safe, isn\u2019t it? Why do barrel shrouds exist? To keep people from burning their hand. But because a killer might benefit from that, in David Chipman\u2019s world they should be banned. Is the new definition of \u201cgun safety\u201d making guns less safe in the hopes killers won\u2019t use them? It\u2019s a dumb argument, particularly because Chipman doesn\u2019t want a barrel shroud ban, he wants a ban on semi-automatic firearms. He could have acknowledged why legal gun owners find a barrel shroud to be useful while still arguing in favor of banning the entire rifle, but he fell into the trap of focusing on features of semi-automatic rifles in an attempt to make them as scary as possible.\n\nThe decision by Democrats to focus on potentially impeaching Donald Trump has likely derailed any gun control package from getting votes in the Senate, at least in the immediate future, but House Democrats can and will continue to approve gun control laws and demand Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hold votes on every one. While the House Judiciary Committee didn\u2019t vote on the proposed gun and magazine ban today, it\u2019s likely the committee will send the ban to the full House for a vote in the not-to-distant future.\n\nIf you\u2019re a glutton for punishment (or are really interested in what happened today) you can watch the entire four-hour hearing below, but you might want to check your blood pressure beforehand.", "description": "Dianna Muller, a 2nd Amendment activist and former law enforcement officer, told lawmakers she would not comply with any future ban on semi-automatic rifles.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/muller1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
