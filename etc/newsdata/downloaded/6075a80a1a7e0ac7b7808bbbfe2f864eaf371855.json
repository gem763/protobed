There were signs of the budding tyrant already in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s dealings with revolutionary comrades during the liberation wars of the 1960s and \u201970s. And when Mr. Mugabe was finally overthrown by the military in November 2017, long after he had laid waste to his once-prosperous land and revealed his dictatorial face, the generals treated him with almost reverential deference. Announcing \u201cComrade\u201d Mugabe\u2019s death on Friday, his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, spoke only of the \u201cicon of liberation,\u201d with no mention of his ouster.\n\nThat reverence for the leaders of liberation struggles, however unfortunate their post-liberation rule, is not unique to Zimbabwe, or to Africa. The fight against colonial rule invariably becomes the founding narrative of a new nation: It was so in the United States, and even more so in developing nations that achieved independence after World War II. Mao Zedong\u2019s huge portrait still gazes down on Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, where the movement against the chairman\u2019s authoritarian legacy was so brutally crushed, and Fidel Castro is still revered across much of Latin America, though he drove Cuba into economic ruin and more than a million countrymen into exile.\n\nSome African nations have been especially loath to strip the halos off revolutionary heroes, given the instability of countries shaped more by the imperial designs of European rulers than by ethnic boundaries. Honorifics like \u201ccomrade\u201d still echo the romance of revolutionary Pan-African ideologies. As late as 2015, with Zimbabwe already in ruins and Mr. Mugabe unwelcome in much of the world, the African Union appointed him chairman for the year.", "description": "The \u201cicon of liberation\u201d who led Zimbabwe to independence also drove the nation into poverty.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/opinion/07-Mugabe-print/07-Mugabe-print-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
