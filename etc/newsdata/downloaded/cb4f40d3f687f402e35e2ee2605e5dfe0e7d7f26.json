Philippines officials previously said Talbot was from Ohio, and records indicate she has family connections there.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

People answering the door in Sandy, Utah, declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nWearing an orange detainee shirt and handcuffs, Talbot, 43, was presented to reporters in Manila on Thursday. She kept her head low and wiped her tears at times. When reporters asked her to comment, Talbot shook her head.\n\nTalbot had planned to board a Delta Air Lines flight to the United States with the baby, airport officials said.\n\n\u201cThere was really an intention to hide the baby,\u201d immigration official Grifton Medina said by telephone.\n\nAfter discovering the baby, airline staff called immigration personnel, who arrested Talbot at the airport. She was later handed over to the National Bureau of Investigation and the baby was turned over to government welfare personnel.\n\nThe NBI said Talbot presented an affidavit at the airport, allegedly from the baby\u2019s mother, identified as Maricris Dulap, giving consent for the baby to travel to the U.S., but it had not been signed by the mother.\n\nOfficials said no government travel approval had been issued for the baby, prompting them to file human trafficking charges against Talbot. The charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Talbot also violated at least two other laws on child abuse, kidnapping and illegal detention, the NBI said.\n\nU.S. Embassy officials were notified of Talbot\u2019s arrest and told Philippine authorities that she has no criminal record in the U.S., NBI official Manuel Dimaano said.\n\nDimaano said Dulap gave her baby to Talbot in southern Davao city. He said investigators will try to determine how Talbot brought the baby out of Davao, which requires a city clearance for infants to be transported by a foreigner.\n\nThe baby\u2019s parents have been charged under a child protection law but have not been placed under arrest, although the mother has been interviewed by social welfare officers, Dimaano said.\n\nHe said Dulap told the officers that she wanted to offer her baby for adoption, and there was no indication that she had sold the baby.\n\nDimaano said when he and other officials asked Talbot what she intended to do with the baby, she replied that she just wanted to give it \u201ca name and a church blessing.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "An American woman who attempted to carry a 6-day-old baby out of the Philippines hidden inside a sling bag has been arrested.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/american-arrested-philippines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
