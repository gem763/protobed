The university was still assessing how to \u201cprevent such mistakes in the future\u201d.\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s investigation cited former media lab employees who spoke about their concerns about the lab\u2019s years-long relationship with Epstein, as well as internal emails from Ito, who wrote of one Epstein donation: \u201cMake sure this gets accounted for as anonymous,\u201d and another from an employee who wrote: \u201cJeffrey money, needs to be anonymous.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, according to Signe Swenson, a former development associate at the lab who spoke to the New Yorker, Epstein himself visited the lab, accompanied by two young female \u201cassistants\u201d.\n\nSwenson said the visit, already uncomfortable, became more distressing at the sight of the young women who accompanied Epstein.\n\nAmong the lab\u2019s staff, \u201call of us women made it a point to be super nice to them. We literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they\u2019re not there by choice, we could maybe help them,\u201d Swenson told the New Yorker.\n\nThe lab\u2019s internal planning for the visit included ensuring Epstein\u2019s name was kept off Ito\u2019s public calendar, and strategizing about how to keep a member of the lab who disapproved of its association with Epstein from seeing the meeting in progress, Swenson told the New Yorker.\n\nIto, who led the influential university research center for eight years, emailed his resignation to university officials on Saturday, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cAfter giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately,\u201d Ito wrote in an email shared with the New York Times.\n\nIto did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe investor and author has been an influential figure in the world of American media, technology, and philanthropy. As well as having served on The New York Times board, he had been serving on the board of the Knight Foundation, one of the most prominent funders of media innovation in the United States; and the MacArthur Foundation, which has given out grants totalling nearly $70bn in the past decades.\n\nIn a tweet on Saturday, the MacArthur foundation announced that Ito had also resigned from its board.\n\n\u201cThe recent reports of Ito\u2019s behavior in The New Yorker, if true, would not be in keeping with the values of MacArthur. Most importantly, our hearts go out to the girls and women who survived the abuse of Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d the foundation tweeted.\n\nThe public revelations about Epstein\u2019s relationships with MIT\u2019s Media Lab had been divisive, with some Lab members and associates defending the center and others calling its ties to Epstein unacceptable. Before the New Yorker story was published, some of Ito\u2019s friends and associates publicly came to his defense.\n\nMIT\u2019s president said the university had taken about $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years. The New Yorker reported Epstein had arranged $7.5m in donations.\n\nEpstein killed himself in jail on 10 August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nJust days ago, a co-founder of the Media Lab had defended its decision to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from Epstein.\n\nPrivate jets, parties and eugenics: Jeffrey Epstein's bizarre world of scientists Read more\n\n\u201cIf you wind back the clock, I would still say \u2018take it\u2019,\u201d Nicholas Negroponte said at a town hall meeting on Wednesday.\n\nNegroponte, whose brother served as an assistant secretary of state under George W Bush, later defended his remarks to the Boston Globe.\n\n\u201cWe all knew he went to jail for soliciting underage prostitution,\u201d Negroponte told the Globe. \u201cBut we thought he served his term and repented.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, as part of a lenient deal with federal prosecutors in Florida. He served 13 months of an 18-month prison sentence, much of it on day release.\n\nThat plea deal came under renewed scrutiny in recent months following a series of articles published by the Miami Herald, leading to new charges being filed against Epstein by federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nAlex Acosta, who as US attorney in Miami oversaw the deal, resigned as US labor secretary.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Joi Ito exits after reports claim lab worked to hide extent of Epstein donations", "authors": ["Lois Beckett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e584e381df6f7d5dce2d3f828ce42e5250d404cf/0_71_4938_2963/master/4938.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c47aee91f6090a59dc65cbdbc9300e04", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
