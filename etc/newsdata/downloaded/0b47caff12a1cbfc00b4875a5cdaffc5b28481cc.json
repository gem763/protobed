Now Marilyn, a 61-year-old gran, must pay him \u00a340,000 in a court-ordered divorce settlement.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry/Sunday Mirror)\n\nPet sitter Marilyn, who has daughters aged 34 and 32 and a 21-year-old son, tells the Sunday Mirror: \u201cI feel sick. I\u2019m a kind and compassionate person and it horrifies me to realise my husband was only after my cash.\n\n\u201cBehind his charisma is a cold and calculating character. He never loved me \u2013 he loved what I could bring him.\n\n\u201cHe mentioned how lucky I was to live in the UK. I brought him here, now I\u2019m paying the price.\u201d\n\nMarilyn thought Amr was 28 when they met and admits being embarrassed after ignoring pleas not to make him husband No3.\n\nRevealing how her heart ruled her head, she says: \u201cIt might sound crazy but those first dates were the best days of my life.\n\n\u201cHe wooed me like a pro and I was flattered. I\u2019d never met anybody who made me laugh like that and was so romantic.\n\n\u201cIt was like a film. He took me to Cairo, he gave me camel rides and one night he stuck candles in the sand and arranged a musician to serenade us.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cI was embarrassed to be with a younger man, but he told me our souls were the same age.\n\n\u201cInitially Amr paid for everything but soon he told me he wanted a phone and then an iPad, which I bought. And I often wired him cash.\n\n\u201cI was happy to oblige him with the odd gift, but back in the UK he wanted more and more and I stupidly went with it. I was insecure being with a young, handsome man and was trying to recapture the good times.\n\n\u201cI even remortgaged my house to buy him stuff.\u201d\n\nMarilyn says warnings from family and friends only made her \u201cmore determined to do what I wanted\u201d.\n\nShe did insist on a pre-nup but never got it signed by a witness \u2013 so it was void.\n\nMarilyn realised things were unravelling after they returned to the UK in 2010, with Amr initially staying on a six-month visa.\n\nHer daughters moved out of the family home in Bexleyheath, South East London, in protest. Marilyn says: \u201cAmr changed almost instantly, becoming moody and more demanding.\n\n\u201cHe kept telling me I promised to take care of him.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cI spent thousands on a car and driving lessons for him so he could have a good life here.\n\n\u201cAfter a while I suspected him of messaging women on social media. He promised he wasn\u2019t but when he returned to Egypt the following February we briefly split.\u201d\n\nMarilyn claims that one woman in her 60s contacted her claiming to be owed \u00a36,000 by Amr.\n\nShe dismissed the woman as a bitter ex \u2013 but now regrets being so hasty. Marilyn says Amr returned to the UK in September 2011 and they rekindled their relationship.\n\nBut within months, Marilyn says she found he had messaged lovelorn women claiming to be an accountant.\n\n\u201cI felt utterly betrayed,\u201d she says. \u201cI confronted him and he swore he would have counselling. I insisted he moved out \u2013 but we remained a couple.\u201d\n\nShe finally dumped him after he persuaded her to buy him a \u00a34,000 second-hand Mercedes in March 2014, promising to pay her back \u00a3200 a month.\n\nMarilyn adds: \u201cWe had this blazing row in front of the salesman and eventually I agreed to buy it, but I felt a fool.\n\n\u201cHe only paid \u00a3400 over two months. Then the bailiffs came round and I found he had taken out two \u00a33,000 loans.\n\n\u201cI insisted he sold the Mercedes to pay off the debts and he was furious.\n\n\u201cI finally realised Amr had only wanted what I could give him. I was utterly humiliated.\n\n\u201cEveryone was thinking \u2018I told you so\u2019. My trust in people was completely destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe divorce was finalised in summer 2014, around the time Amr was granted leave to remain in the UK.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry/Sunday Mirror)\n\nThey did meet up occasionally and Marilyn learned Amr had jobs at fast-food chains and other girlfriends.\n\nThen, last year, came the financial bombshell \u2013 a \u00a3100,000 divorce claim. By the time it reached court last month the claim was down to \u00a350,000, which Marilyn rejected.\n\nBut eight days later she was ordered to pay \u00a340,000 in a judgment at Medway County Court, Kent. It was concluded Marilyn would likely be able to meet her own needs in the future, whereas Amr would need to \u201cestablish himself\u201d in the UK.\n\nMarilyn, who hopes to appeal, says: \u201cI am staggered, it\u2019s an outrage. I cannot see how this man is entitled to a penny.\u201d\n\nThe judge made an exemption on her home being sold to cover costs but recommended proceeds from selling her villa could be used. The holiday home is up for sale but Marilyn has to split proceeds with her second husband \u2013 then take out a loan to pay off Amr.\n\nHer daughters have set up a crowdunding page to help. Marilyn admits: \u201cI got myself into this mess by being too kind and compassionate. I was gullible.\u201d\n\nAmr told the Mirror: \u201cThis was a court order. They reviewed everything and I have been rewarded that sum.\n\n\u201cI did not lie. I believe the courts here are very fair.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Merry/Sunday Mirror)\n\nHe admitted accepting financial help during their marriage, saying: \u201cShe was financially better positioned than me and willing to pay for everything.\n\n\u201cI was impressed by her lifestyle and just wanted an adventure and to have a good time. That\u2019s it.\n\n\"She wanted me to stop working, said she had money and didn\u2019t care about it. All marriages have financial issues.\u201d\n\nHe is now 33 and denied lying about his age.\n\nBut he admitted he could \u201cnot remember\u201d if he used the cougar dating site to contact other women or not.\n\nAmr added: \u201cShe will try anything possible. She might be upset and be seeking revenge.\n\n\u201cI did love her. We travelled and had an amazing time. Anyway, we\u2019re here now.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Marilyn Lewis was flattered to be wooed by an Egyptian toyboy - but things soon turned sour when they moved back to the UK", "authors": ["Amy Sharpe", "Image", "Tim Merry Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466349.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Marilyn-Lewis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
