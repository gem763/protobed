You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt was, predictably, a foretaste of what is to come. And what is to come, I suspect, is the country coming to realise what\u2019s already long been known.\n\nThat Boris Johnson really, truly, isn\u2019t very good at this stuff. And though Jeremy Corbyn isn\u2019t either, he does have a certain knack for turning it on when an election comes round (and if you include Labour leadership elections, they tend to almost every year).\n\nPrivately, the Conservatives are worried that Jeremy Corbyn will turn the election into an election on anything but Brexit, and specifically the crisis in the NHS. And privately, the Conservatives are slightly concerned that they\u2019ve accidentally scheduled this election to take place slap bang in the middle of what NHS chiefs are confidently predicting will be the worst NHS winter crisis in decades.\n\nThat would explain why Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. But it doesn\u2019t explain the quite stunning lack of emotional intelligence he displayed over the despatch boxes at PMQs. (There are, of course, other things that explain that. Secret court cases to suppress knowledge of the existence of his own children, for example.)\n\nAt one point, Jeremy Corbyn read a letter he had been sent by a woman called Gillian, whose mother had died earlier this year, and in her final years of ill health had suffered as a direct result of shortages of doctors and nurses in the NHS and lengthy waiting time for treatment.\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s respectful pause among MPs, then Johnson rose.\n\n\u201cI can certainly say that we will deal with his constituent Gillian\u2019s concerns,\u201d he said, before switching directly into a wild pre-scripted rant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to be an Islingtonian protester, siding with Russia over what happened in Salisbury,\u201d he blithered, pointing his finger. \u201cFlip flopping one way, now the other. Leave one week, remain the next.\u201d Blah blah blah.\n\nGillian, we must assume, was watching. Gillian\u2019s concerns, that he had just promised to \u201cdeal with\u201d, were that her mother had died a harsh death in shocking circumstances.\n\nAnd here was the actual prime minister, wafting it all away with a lie so wearily quotidian he didn\u2019t even realise he was telling it. Yes yes, Gillian\u2019s mum. I\u2019ll sort that out, whatever it is. Dead is she? Oh right. Yes, We\u2019ll sort all that out. Anyway Salisbury. Hugo Chavez. Get Brexit Done.\n\nIt was risible stuff. Johnson is a walking gaffe machine. That\u2019s well known. That, indeed, is why his handlers in the Tory leadership campaign wisely placed him under house arrest almost for its entirety. (They would discover, of course, that he was more than capable of screwing it all up even from inside there, when the police were called to investigate reports of domestic abuse.)\n\nThe question is not if or even when he will hopelessly humiliate himself in the next six weeks. It\u2019s only the degree to which it matters.\n\nBut the early evidence is clear: he\u2019s hopelessly exposed, and not very good.", "description": "None of the campaigns has yet begun in earnest but already we\u2019re straight in to the Brexit but not Brexit election.
