On Monday, she announced the full House will vote to formally launch impeachment proceedings that will be out in the open, instead of in the dark.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to suggest they have the goods on Trump. But fact is, none of the witnesses they have called so far have any firsthand knowledge of presidential wrongdoing.\n\nBehind closed doors and with no media allowed, House Democrats have tried to put on the \u00adappearance of a legal proceeding. At the end of each session, they leak what they claim happened. The media are all too willing to play along, printing the Democratic pols\u2019 claims as if they were fact.\n\n\u201cPowerful testimony from multiple State and national \u00adsecurity officials,\u201d The Hill reports, adding up to a \u201cscathing picture of Trump and his allies withholding nearly $400 million in security aid from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPolitico called the testimony of Bill Taylor, the acting envoy to Kiev, \u201cexplosive\u201d \u2014 though Taylor\u2019s prepared statement merely \u00adregurgitated what other State \u00adDepartment bureaucrats had told him. His source was the rumor mill. It\u2019s called hearsay.\n\nThe New York Times reports \u201ca rapidly moving investigation securing damning testimony.\u201d That\u2019s hardly the case. But soon the jig will be up. No matter how many \u201cwitnesses\u201d Democrats parade into their hearings, it won\u2019t matter if they have no firsthand knowledge. Even the Times concedes that to \u00adimpeach a president, the House needs proof \u201ctying him directly\u201d to wrongdoing.\n\nBefore Pelosi\u2019s announcement on Monday, Adam Schiff, the House intelligence-committee chairman who is overseeing the secret hearings, gave up on calling witnesses who have firsthand knowledge of Trump\u2019s \u00adnegotiations with the Ukrainian president.\n\nSchiff caved after a key witness actually challenged the committee\u2019s subpoena as illegitimate and said see you in court. Charles Kupperman, former deputy \u00adnational-security adviser and one of the few people who was on Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, filed a lawsuit, arguing that the House committee can\u2019t compel testimony for an impeachment until the full House votes to authorize subpoenas for that purpose. That, of course, is the vote Pelosi was dodging.\n\nsee also Why the secrecy, Rep. Schiff? House Minority Whip Steve Scalise asks an excellent question: \u201cWhat...\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope with the courts,\u201d Schiff said. Translation: Democrats don\u2019t think they would win in the highest court.\n\nThey also don\u2019t want to risk dragging the inquiry on for months, as they did with the Mueller investigation. Better to ram anything through. After all, without evidence of grave wrongdoing, the Republican-controlled Senate won\u2019t remove this president from office. But Dems have one goal \u2014 to impeach Trump, damaging him sufficiently to tip the 2020 election.\n\nSchiff\u2019s cynical decision not to meet Kupperman in court indicates he also may not want to press for testimony from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or Energy Secretary Rick Perry, or former National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2014 men who actually know the facts about Trump\u2019s dealings with the Ukraine.\n\nAdditional witnesses are scheduled to appear before Schiff\u2019s committee later this week. But they will offer more of the same. \u201cIt\u2019s always people who talked to people who have talked to other people who think that he might have meant this,\u201d says Rep. Mark Meadows, an intelligence-committee member witnessing the charade.\n\nThe public isn\u2019t stupid, and Pelosi is a far better politician than Schiff. Polls show fewer than half of voters supporting impeachment in key swing states like Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These are states Trump won in 2016, and Pelosi has been reluctant to put Democratic members from these states on the spot. Trump called her bluff.\n\nNow the Democrats will have to put up or shut up.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York.", "description": "Democrats have been trying to suggest they have the goods on Trump.
