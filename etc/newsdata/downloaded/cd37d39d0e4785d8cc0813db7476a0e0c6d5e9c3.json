Winds this strong can lead to sporadic power outages.\n\nA general 25 to 75 millimeters of rain is forecast with an AccuWeather Local StormMax\u2122 of 100 millimeters predicted.\n\n\"Since the bulk of this rain is likely to fall in 12 hours, it is enough to trigger isolated incidents of flash and urban flooding,\" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson.\n\nWhere leaves have fallen or will be knocked down by the storm and accumulate on the roads, slick travel conditions can occur and blocked storm drains may lead to street flooding.\n\nCommuters should expect a stormy day on Thursday in Halifax, Nova Scotia; Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; and St. John, Fredericton and Moncton, New Brunswick, as well as locations far inland including Montreal and Quebec City.\n\nWhile the period of strong easterly to southeasterly winds will be brief, seas will quickly build. Conditions will be dangerous for small craft through Thursday night. Large waves will pound the east- and southeast-facing coastal areas with considerable overwash on roads along the immediate shoreline.\n\n\"Although the forward speed of the storm will slow substantially, rain and gusty winds will expand northward during Thursday night and Friday,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"However, since the storm will have matured already, the storm will be much less severe and more typical of average for this time of the year in Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as eastern Quebec,\" he added.\n\nUnsettled conditions with chilly winds and showers are forecast to linger over the Maritimes and southern Quebec to end the week.\n\nSome wet snow is likely to fall over the sparsely populated Laurentian Mountains in central and eastern Quebec. Several centimeters may fall over the higher terrain from the storm.\n\nThe weather is forecast to improve from southwest to northeast across southeastern Canada this weekend.\n\nDownload the free AccuWeather app to see the latest forecast for your region.
