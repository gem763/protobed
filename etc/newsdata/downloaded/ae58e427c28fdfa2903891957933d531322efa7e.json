We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone.\"\n\nMPs have passed a law requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October.\n\nDetailed plan\n\nWith the detailed proposals on the table, the UK side hopes that by the end of the week, both the EU and UK would be in a period of intense negotiations where both sides thrash out a final text.\n\nBut there is no certainty over whether the EU will accept the premise of the plans in order to move to the next phase of talks.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nThe policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs.\n\nSince becoming prime minister, Mr Johnson has stressed to EU leaders the backstop would have to be replaced if any deal was to be passed by Parliament.\n\nMr Johnson has argued that the backstop would keep the UK too closely aligned with EU rules after Brexit.\n\nThe EU Commission has said it is willing to look at new proposals but these must achieve the same aims as the backstop - and be legally enforceable.\n\nSources involved in the negotiations with the EU say the checks proposed would not be at the Irish border, and suggestions there would be a series of checkpoints along the border are a misunderstanding.\n\nTalks have continued between the UK and EU, at a technical level. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier met on Friday.\n\nThe BBC understands the proposals will accept the need for customs checks on the island of Ireland - but insist these checks, as the government previously pledged, would be conducted away from the border.\n\nCustoms formalities would be carried out mostly where goods originate or at their final destination.\n\nThe UK government maintains that any further customs inspections would be very limited - and these could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises.\n\nThe Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a \"string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier\" had been floated by the UK.\n\nHowever, government sources have denied that UK officials had proposed a series of inspection posts on either side of the Irish border.", "description": "It includes the legal text of an updated Brexit deal, including suggested \"customs clearance zones\" in Northern Ireland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/02C6/production/_109001700_9eb03bdb-554c-4117-bd9b-0c92a2edbcbb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
