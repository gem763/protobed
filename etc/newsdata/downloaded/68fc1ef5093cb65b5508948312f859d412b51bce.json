And all but one of them made their fortunes in the tech industry.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos tops the list with a net worth of $114 billion, followed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates ($106 billion), investor and Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett ($80.8 billion), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($69.6 billion), and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison ($65 billion), according to the Forbes ranking.\n\nTheir combined fortune comes out to more than 2% of the US GDP, which was $21.34 trillion in the second quarter of 2019. (Exactly 2% of $21.34 trillion would be $426.8 billion.)\n\nMark Zuckerberg is the fourth-richest person in the US.

And that's based on a net worth of just $2 billion, the median fortune of a Forbes list billionaire.\n\nWhile these five men are the richest in the US, one European billionaire knocks Ellison off the list of five richest men in the world. Bernard Arnault, the French businessman who controls LVMH, is worth $91.9 billion, making him the third-richest person in the world after Bezos and Gates, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Forbes estimates his net worth at a slightly lower $91.4 billion, still well above Zuckerberg and Ellison.\n\nRead more: Bernard Arnault just finalized his $219 million pledge to help rebuild the Notre-Dame in Paris.

New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have the highest concentration of billionaires in the country.\n\nChina comes in second place, with 285 billionaires, but it may be catching up to the US. According to a recent PBS report, China is producing billionaires at a faster rate than any other country.", "description": "Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Ellison are the richest people in the US.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c34f73cbd7730374e05f3fa?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
