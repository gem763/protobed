Michael Cisneros, one of the toddlers' father, shared the heart-melting footage last week after seeing the kids erupt in joy.\n\nCisneros posted the clip showing the children sprint toward one another, arms outstretched and smiling, after being apart for just a few days. \"It's Thursday,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"These two haven't seen each other since Tuesday. So many feels, it's beautiful. So thankful.\"\n\nThe 2-year-olds, Maxwell and Finnegan, live a block apart in Washington Heights, CBS New York reports. The two have been best friends for about a year and just started riding the bus together to day care since they live in the same neighborhood.\n\nCisneros, who is Maxwell's father, told New York station WPIX-TV \"it was just a lucky moment and I got it on camera.\" He explained why he chose to share it, even though he's normally a private person.\n\n\"With all the racism and hate going on, I just think it's a really beautiful video,\" he told WPIX. \"The reason that it's getting attention [is] because it is with a little black boy and a little white boy... But if it can change someone's mind, you know, or just change their view on things, then it's totally worth it.\"", "description": "The little boys have been best friends for about a year \u2014 and they seem to be inseparable", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/cf6786fa-1063-402f-be45-4b25984efb6b/thumbnail/1200x630/3e6b720f13e2c4a1555df81a16185a6f/screen-shot-2019-09-10-at-3-58-39-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
