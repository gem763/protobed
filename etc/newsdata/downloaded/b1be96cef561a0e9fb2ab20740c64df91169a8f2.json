Like a real-life version of Trump\u2019s favorite song.\n\nIf Sessions had stayed out of the primary he might never have been Attorney General. But he\u2019d still be a senator from Alabama and a figure beloved by Republican nationalists instead of unemployed and a perpetual whipping boy for their new favorite politician. You knew damn well he was a snake before you took him in, Jeff. How much sympathy can we really have?\n\nThere are two things that make these comments newsworthy.\n\nGORKA: Last two questions. How are we doing, Mr. President, in defeating the Deep State? TRUMP: Well, I think, if it all works out, I will consider it one of the greatest things I\u2019ve done. You look at what\u2019s happened to the absolute scum at the top of the FBI. You look at what\u2019s happening over at the Justice Department, now we have a great attorney general. Whereas before that, with Jeff Sessions, it was a disaster. Just a total disaster. He was an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama. And I put him there because he endorsed me, and he wanted it so badly. And I wish he\u2019d never endorsed me.\n\nI can think of at least one other person who wishes Sessions had never endorsed Trump. Anyway, that\u2019s newsworthy in the first place because Sessions himself recently had occasion to comment publicly on Trump \u2014 and was characteristically gracious, ignoring the many months of Twitter tirades he endured as AG:\n\nIn a speech to Alabama Republicans at a fundraiser Tuesday night, the former longtime senator said despite nearly two years of being publicly berated by Trump, \u201cI still do support him\u201d and his policies. Sessions said Trump continues \u201crelentlessly and actually honoring the promises he made to the American people,\u201d such as \u201cboldly\u201d asserting the principles of the Republican Party, despite being engulfed in scandal after scandal. Sessions praised Trump\u2019s trade maneuvers with China and his foreign policy and immigration moves\u2026 \u201cThere was one problem as attorney general, that\u2019s for sure, as you well know,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI like to say a lot of people get fired from their work, but mine was a little more public than most. You do the best you can. At least they don\u2019t shoot you when they fire you.\u201d\n\nMuch has been written (including by me) about Trump\u2019s transactional nature but his capacity to pursue a vendetta long after it\u2019s stopped being useful to him is constantly amazing. The most notorious example is him wandering off-script at official events occasionally to remind the audience how much he disliked the now long-dead John McCain but his Sessions grudge is almost as weird. We get it \u2014 he resents the fact that Sessions did something ethical by recusing himself from the Russiagate probe instead of acting like a southern-fried Roy Cohn. He\u2019s raged about it at length literally for years now. In the end Mueller didn\u2019t charge him and didn\u2019t even give Democrats enough to impeach him for obstruction, and Trump finally ended up replacing Sessions with a much more accommodating AG. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be ready to shift towards more conciliatory talking points about Sessions \u2014 \u201ca good man, didn\u2019t agree with his recusal decision, but I\u2019ll always be grateful for that endorsement,\u201d and so on. Nope.\n\nWhich brings us to the other reason this is newsworthy. Jeff Sessions has a lot of friends in Mitch McConnell\u2019s caucus, having spent 20 years in the Senate before being named AG. No doubt many of those friends are unhappy with how Sessions was demagogued by Trump during the Russiagate process. There\u2019s also no doubt that some will be annoyed to see Trump still flogging him, long after POTUS stopped getting any political mileage from it. Some might even draw a lesson in loyalty from it: Sessions, who stuck his neck out to become the only U.S. senator willing to formally support Trump in 2016, was rewarded in due time with endless abuse. His early, even singular loyalty earned him nothing from the president.\n\nThese are the people who\u2019ll soon be rendering a verdict on impeachment.\n\nYou would think Trump would be willing to make a few small concessions to their sensitivities even knowing how unlikely it is that that they\u2019d ever vote to remove him, but instead he seems willing to antagonize them repeatedly and gratuitously. There\u2019s today\u2019s pummeling of Sessions. There\u2019s his decision to step aside in northern Syria and let Turkey mash the Kurds, a decision seen by nearly every Republican in Congress as a grievous betrayal. There were the antics last week on the White House lawn when he called publicly on Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens, making it that much harder for Republicans to spin his phone call with Zelensky. It\u2019s not just right-wingers on the Hill whom he\u2019s feuding with either. He\u2019s decided to escalate his attacks on Fox News, a key messenger in his impeachment media strategy:\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nHe decided to make an enemy of John Bolton too by firing him just as the Ukraine matter was coming to a head behind closed doors, despite doubtless knowing of Bolton\u2019s willingness to settle scores with his enemies via leaks to the media. News broke just this morning that Bolton is already writing a book about his experiences with Trump; whether he\u2019s also been a source of the many damaging national-security scoops that have ended up in newspapers lately remains an open question.\n\nMeanwhile, rising support for impeachment is making it that much easier for Senate Republicans who are weary of the daily circus to give removal a second look.\n\nAll of this feels like a domestic version of Trump\u2019s trade-war policies. In each case he\u2019s facing a formidable adversary, China on the one hand and House Democrats on the other. The logical thing to do strategically would be to make nice with allies, offering concessions as needed in hopes of assembling a united front against the enemy. Instead Trump lashes out indiscriminately at everyone, slapping tariffs on allies in the trade-war context and slapping Jeff Sessions across the face today in print knowing that Senate Republicans won\u2019t like it. There\u2019s no eight-dimensional chess here; there\u2019s not even checkers. In both cases the \u201cstrategy\u201d is simply brute-force intimidation, believing in the case of trade that allies will have no choice but to acquiesce to the demands of the American superpower and believing in the case of impeachment that Senate Republicans will have no choice but to acquiesce to the will of his voters, which is to protect Trump at all costs. A little bit of honey would make his life easier but it\u2019s all vinegar:\n\nIn private, Trump is increasingly leaning on the Republican leader in the Senate. In a return to the President\u2019s panicked behavior during the height of the Mueller investigation, Trump is calling McConnell as often as three times a day, according to a person familiar with the conversations\u2026 Trump has been lashing out at GOP senators he sees as disloyal, according to the person familiar with the conversations, telling McConnell he will amplify attacks on those Republicans who criticize him.\n\nMaybe tomorrow he\u2019ll dump on Ronald Reagan during a press conference or call George W. Bush some names. See if he can alienate every last remaining Republican on the Hill who\u2019s kinda sorta well disposed to him.\n\nAs long as he has people like this in conservative media willing to treat him like an actual king, he may figure that intimidation on the Hill is destined to work. The cultier the party becomes, the greater the risk to anyone who tries to leave the cult. Why make concessions to get your way if you can get it with threats instead?", "description": "Vendetta.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ts.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
