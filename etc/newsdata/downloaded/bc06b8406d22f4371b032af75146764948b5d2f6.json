(Reuters)\n\nThis is what it\u2019s come to for Lonzo Ball.\n\nBall, a professional basketball player and former No. 2 pick in the NBA draft, hit some uncontested mid-range jump shots in a gym.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSomebody took video of it.\n\nHis new team, the New Orleans Pelicans, posted said video on its Twitter account with a fire emoji and the caption \u201cCookin.\u201d\n\nHere it is.\n\nLonzo Ball is \u2018cookin\u2019\n\nBall, a point guard, is a notoriously bad shooter. He\u2019s a good playmaker and an above-average rebounder for a guard. But his woeful shooting from everywhere on the court has prevented him from coming anywhere close to approaching his lofty draft status.\n\nIn two seasons, Ball has shot 38 percent from the field, 31.5 percent from 3-point distance and 44.9 percent from the free throw line. Again, he\u2019s a point guard. Not Shaq.\n\nHis form is different ... does it mean anything?\n\nHis form here with the Pelicans is different than the literal shoot-from-the-hip approach he displayed at UCLA and with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBut who knows what it means? This is a dude hitting open jumpers in a gym.\n\nEveryone knows that Ball desperately needs to work on his jump shot, and this video follows the now-tradition of struggling shooters posting videos of themselves doing moderately impressive things in situations that don\u2019t remotely resemble game action.\n\nWe\u2019ll refrain from any \u201cCookin\u201d assessment until Ball regularly does this in NBA games.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Pelicans are easily impressed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9MMVtp27PM2VnaJH.L6Upw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vHzg3S6kciwI6lRJM6H5NA--~B/aD0zMTg2O3c9NDU1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/62f0f030-e498-11e9-9ffe-8a4359030804"}
