Democrats, meanwhile, have said the production of such warheads, which can be placed on submarines, could increase the likelihood of a nuclear conflict.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, Washington state Democrat, has long been a critic of nuclear modernization and has vowed to reduce spending on the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. He has called for a review of the Trump administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review and a ban on low-yield nuclear warheads, among other weapons.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
