Nyemah was holding a bat and reportedly damaged his ex-girlfriend's vehicle before throwing rocks through the front door, which prompted Cox to arm himself with a shotgun and call police.\n\nNyemah fled the scene in his vehicle, but he was arrested late last week and then released on bond.\n\nFollowing Nyemah's release, he told 6 ABC Action News that \"most\" of what was written in the criminal complaint was true. He also said he was looking for his ex-girlfriend at the time because he believed they were \"rekindling their romance.\"\n\nNyemah's ex-girlfriend was reportedly granted a temporary restraining order against Nyemah, who is expected to appear in court later this month.\n\nThe 28-year-old Cox is in his eighth NFL season, all of which have been spent with the Eagles. Like the 3-4 Eagles as a whole, Cox is off to something of a slow start, with just 17 tackles and one sack through seven games.\n\nCox\u2014a four-time Pro Bowler and one-time first-team All-Pro\u2014set a career high last season with 10.5 sacks as he helped lead the Eagles to a wild-card berth.\n\nAll told, the No. 12 overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft has 45.5 career sacks, which is seventh on the franchise's all-time list and first among those who primarily played defensive tackle.", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles  defensive tackle  Fletcher Cox  used a shotgun to prevent a man from breaking into his home last week, according to court records...", "authors": ["Mike"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/834/628/hi-res-580330e39af417ba316b81ae2cdf010d_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
