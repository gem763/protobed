Boone Vandzura, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said the man was in the surf with another person near Flambeau Road in the Hatteras Village area when he went into distress about 5:25 p.m.\n\nThe other person brought the man closer to shore, where rescue workers pulled him in and performed CPR, but they were unsuccessful, Vandzura said. The state medical examiner will determine whether the man drowned or suffered an unrelated medical emergency.\n\nA high risk of rip currents was forecast for the Hatteras area Sunday, and rip currents were seen in the area, Vandzura said. The Park Service recommends that swimmers in the Atlantic Ocean swim with a friend, use a flotation device, be aware of tide conditions and swim near a beach with lifeguards. The man who died did not have a flotation device, Vandzura said.\n\nThe man\u2019s death was only the second water-related fatality off Cape Hatteras National Seashore this year, compared to five last year, seven in 2017 and eight in 2016.", "description": "Rip currents caused by Hurricane Dorian may have contributed to his death, authorities said.", "authors": ["Tom Jackman", "Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oZX5rStgSBn17ltlZF0YpzF3VIM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQLKJWGNTMI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
