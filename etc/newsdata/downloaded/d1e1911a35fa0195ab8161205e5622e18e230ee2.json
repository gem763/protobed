As he launches his own classical record label, the guitarist reveals how it all started with the humble recorder\n\nJonny Greenwood is looking well, all things considered. There\u2019s a thin triangle of stubble on his top lip that the morning razor has missed and a slight bleariness around the eyes, but it\u2019s unlikely anyone spotting Radiohead\u2019s lead guitarist in the corner of this London cafe at 10am would guess that he hasn\u2019t been to bed for 24 hours. \u201cNo, not really had any sleep,\u201d he mutters, running a hand through his shiny dark hair. \u201cHour, maybe?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s here to discuss his new classical music record label, Octatonic, but at midnight he was taking a bow at the Albert Hall following a meticulously curated Prom. It was the culmination of his second life as a composer, a 16-year career that has seen him write for the London Sinfonietta, work as composer-in-residence for BBC Concert Orchestra, collaborate with the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki and create remarkable scores for the films of Lynne Ramsay and Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nThe Prom included three of Greenwood\u2019s compositions, plus works by Penderecki, Steve Reich and Heinrich Biber (\u201cThat was well Radiohead!\u201d surmised two lads in the bar at the interval) and ended with the world premiere of Horror Vacui, his 36-minute piece for 68 strings and solo violin.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d he says, of hearing the work performed in public for the first time. \u201cTotally different from recording with Radiohead. You\u2019re planning for something that\u2019s going to happen just once. The focus is on 30 minutes of performance, and that focus lasts for nine months. There\u2019s maybe 20 bars I\u2019d happily take out, but unlike a lot of things I\u2019ve written this felt like there was more successful stuff in it than not.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018He is superhuman\u2019 \u2026 Greenwood with violinist Daniel Pioro at this year\u2019s Proms. Photograph: Mark Allan/BBC\n\nGreenwood is humble when talking about his music, and he\u2019ll happily change the subject from himself to the performers (\u201creal musicians\u201d) and his star violinist, Daniel Pioro. \u201cDaniel is superhuman. I first saw him when he was performing this Gerald Barry piece, Triorchic Blues, and it was the last time someone\u2019s played something that has given me this incredible physical response, this insane rush. It\u2019s a moment I\u2019m still chasing. I\u2019ve been obsessed with Daniel ever since.\u201d\n\nThat obsession is evident in Octatonic\u2019s first release. Although the series will mainly focus on contemporary classical music, Volume 1 features Pioro playing Bach\u2019s Partita No 2 in D minor, one of the most beautiful \u2013 but most performed \u2013 pieces of music ever. Greenwood agrees. \u201cIt has everything, and with Daniel it sounds like a fresh piece of music.\u201d\n\nNamed after his favourite eight-note musical scale (\u201cYeah, I know \u2013 nerdy\u201d) Octatonic also plans to focus on intimate works by soloists or small groups. Volume 2 features Oliver Coates performing Industry, Michael Gordon\u2019s work for cello and electronics, and pianist Katherine Tinker playing Greenwood\u2019s Three Miniatures from Water.\n\nThe idea for Octatonic, explains Greenwood, came after a late-night visit to Bleep, the hip online independent record shop. \u201cI was looking for the classical section,\u201d he says, \u201cand I realised there isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s not that I thought there\u2019d be a massive interest in new classical music on vinyl, but I thought there\u2019d be something.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Music bursting its banks \u2026 Radiohead play Sydney in 2012. Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty\n\nSomewhat controversially, given that classical music is one of the few genres keeping CD sales alive, Octatonic releases will only be available on vinyl and download. \u201cMost people I know stream their music,\u201d says Greenwood, \u201cand if they really like it, they might buy the vinyl. There is something about listening to it on vinyl \u2013 you feel compelled to hear the whole thing. It\u2019s an event in itself. We use old tube mics, looking for warmth and musicality above detail, but other than that it\u2019s all about the players.\u201d\n\nMica Levi is high on his list of new composers whose work he hopes to release. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing. In the rock world, there\u2019s lots of bluffers. It takes one to know one, right? But sometimes you see the real thing, and Mica is it. So is Edmund Finnis. Theirs is really good writing.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t running a classical music label less exciting than playing guitar in Radiohead? \u201cPeople assume it\u2019s this fuddy-duddy world,\u201d Greenwood says. \u201cBut a violinist can do more with their bow hair than anyone can with a guitar or synthesiser. Then their left hand, each of their fingers \u2026 a whole universe of sounds.\u201d\n\nHe insists this enthusiasm isn\u2019t only about the superiority of classical instruments to electronics: \u201cI\u2019ve seen bands set up by plugging a lightning cable into an iPad and that\u2019s the show. And modern electronic music can feel like that to me sometimes. Where\u2019s the effort? What\u2019s at stake? It seems to be lots of men, standing around watching another man, and no one\u2019s dancing and there\u2019s not much joy. I don\u2019t think classical music is old-fashioned at all, especially when 20-year-old kids are doing it. I haven\u2019t played with musicians like this since school days. It\u2019s so exciting.\u201d\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson sent me some film clips and I thought: 'It's going to be nice to be in a band with this person'\n\nLike so many children, Greenwood\u2019s first instrument was the recorder. Unlike many of us, however, he fell in love with his. He played baroque music in teenage recorder groups, then joined Thames Vale Youth Orchestra, where he developed a love for Sibelius and Messiaen. But the power of the humble recorder never left him.\n\n\u201cOh I could easily talk for an hour about the recorder!\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the great joys of playing American sports arenas with Radiohead is their amazing communal showers. I\u2019ll get to the venue early, seek out these rooms that smell of Deep Heat and jockstraps, get out my recorder, play one of Telemann\u2019s canonic sonatas and just be swamped in this flattering reverb. I have fantasies of putting demands on the rider. You know, instead of cocaine and call girls, hook me up with a really good amateur recorder group. It\u2019s sick, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nGreenwood joined Radiohead when he was 14, to play harmonica. He has subsequently been the group\u2019s guitarist, keyboardist and arranger, with a freedom to incorporate everything from banjo to harp into their sound. It is Greenwood\u2019s love of Penderecki that inspired the Mellotron on Exit Music for a Film, and his decision to employ Messiaen\u2019s favoured keyboard, the ondes Martenot, on How to Disappear Completely.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still my job,\u201d he says, \u201cturning up with some new and exciting instrument. The only difference between the guitar and the ondes Martenot is that you end up playing one more often because of touring.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unnerving \u2026 trailer for The Master, scored by Greenwood\n\nGreenwood also showcased his love of the ondes Martenot in 2005, when he premiered a 20-minute work, Popcorn Superhet Receiver, with the BBC Concert Orchestra. It caught the attention of director Paul Thomas Anderson, then working on There Will Be Blood. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen any of his films,\u201d says Greenwood in a stage whisper, \u201cbut he sent me some clips and I thought, it\u2019s going to be nice to be in a band with this person!\u201d\n\nHis music for Anderson\u2019s 2012 film The Master is brilliantly unnerving. He saw Anderson at the Prom, he says, \u201cthrowing out a hundred film ideas \u2026 A horror film was something we discussed.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut I suppose There Will Be Blood is horror in its own way. Even Phantom Thread: the innocent village girl brought to the evil old man\u2019s house at the top of the hill. But when you sit and watch PT\u2019s films with him, you realise they\u2019re all comedies. He\u2019s literally chuckling away through the whole thing.\u201d\n\nGreenwood\u2019s work as a composer has greatly benefited his working relationship with Radiohead. \u201cI\u2019m less fearful of getting strings in now,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Burn the Witch, I finally had the gall to say, let\u2019s leave this completely unfinished and let the strings finish it. In the past, I wouldn\u2019t have had the brass neck.\u201d\n\nAs for future Radiohead plans, there are none. Since June, when the group released MiniDiscs [Hacked] \u2013 18 hours of material from their OK Computer recording sessions \u2013 activities have been quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he says, with an apologetic smile. \u201cWe don\u2019t tour until we\u2019ve got new music and new music doesn\u2019t happen until we get together and that doesn\u2019t happen until everyone\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Returning music to intimate places \u2026 Greenwood. Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian\n\nThe group donated the profits from MiniDiscs [Hacked] to Extinction Rebellion. Greenwood agrees that environmental awareness has improved since the early 00s when Radiohead began campaigning for Greenpeace, but is reluctant to see the group as a standard-bearer. \u201cAre you saying our legacy will be, \u2018We warned you it was going to be terrible, and now it is?\u2019 Wow. Good times.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks criticisms of campaigners, such as Radiohead, who regularly use air travel to work, are often deployed to distract from the bigger picture. \u201cYes, this person is a hypocrite because they flew. But if picking holes in someone\u2019s green credentials is all you need to convince yourself there\u2019s no climate change problem then you\u2019re kind of an idiot.\u201d\n\nAs we leave, a Julia Holter track is playing over the cafe speakers amid the clatter of brunch. \u201cThere was something Alan Bennett said,\u201d says Greenwood, as he puts on his coat, \u201cabout music having burst its banks. It used to be in these little confined spaces where you\u2019d seek it out and have an experience. This music playing now was recorded by people concentrating on it. But we\u2019re just kind of talking over it. One of my hopes for Octatonic is that it\u2019s a way to hear people playing closely, create that little space, and the next time you\u2019re walking past a poster for a concert in a church, or some solo violin music, you might want to pop in and seek out the real thing.\u201d\n\nVolume 1: Partita No 2 in D minor and Volume 2: Industry, Water are out on Jonny Greenwood\u2019s Octatonic Records.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
