Bankrate surveyed 2,498 people.\n\nGen Xers had easier access to credit\n\nThe era of credit cards being handed out like candy on college campuses is over. \u201cI hear from so many Gen Xers oh I got my first credit card when I was in college. They set up a table on the quad, they gave me a lame giveaway like a t-shirt or something and I got this card and I ran up a ton of debt,\u201d says Bankrate credit card analyst Ted Rossman.\n\nIt has gotten harder for millennials to obtain their first credit card since the last recession. Right before the 2008 financial crisis, consumer debt rose to $12.68 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Credit Card Act of 2009, which took effect in 2010, aimed to address the factors that contributed to Americans\u2019 skyrocketing debt, including curtailing abusive practices by credit card issuers.\n\nGetty Images More\n\nRossman says an unintended consequence of the Credit Card Act was that it made it harder to get a credit card. \u201cOne of the key provisions of this law was to push credit card marketers off college campuses and to make it difficult to get a credit card before your 21st birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in practice is that even beyond 21, people are having trouble qualifying for their first card because it\u2019s like getting your first job. Everybody wants you to have experience but if you don\u2019t have experience then how do you get it?\u201d (Length of credit history makes up about 15% of your overall credit score).\n\nIndeed, banks tightened standards on credit card loans this year, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s quarterly survey of senior loan officers.\n\nThe Credit Card Act also allowed credit card issuers to raise interest rates, a major contributing factor to rising debt. Consumer debt has risen to $13.86 trillion as of the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to raise a rate on an existing balance is when you tie it to an underlying index like the prime rate. So what happened post-2010 is that almost all major issuers tied their rates in with the prime rate,\u201d says Rossman.\n\nThe four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2018 made matters worse for consumers by pushing these variable rates higher. \u201cIt\u2019s actually compounded\u2026 the [debt] problem we\u2019re talking about, which is, it\u2019s easy to get into credit card debt, it\u2019s hard to get out,\u201d says Rossman.\n\nOvercoming challenges to obtaining credit\n\nIt\u2019s important for consumers to check their credit reports and scores. While 54% of older generations are confident they know their credit score, only 43% of millennials feel the same. \u201cYou need to check your credit report and score and figure out where you stand. And if there are errors on there, get them corrected,\u201d says Rossman.\n\nMore from Sibile:\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s immunity to big market losses spells trouble for Wall Street\n\nThese people are most likely to lose their jobs first in a recession\n\nHow Fed Chair Powell can avoid a stock market nightmare\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s efforts to keep immigrants out hurts the U.S. economy\n\nTrump delays tariffs to appease Christmas shoppers\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit", "description": "More than half of millennials report being denied at least one financial product, such as credit cards and loans, because of their credit score.", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mxzDIOeUzptyXtKMNubGnw--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/27fa1f70-c99e-11e9-bae7-15fb7922809f", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
