The Broncos are unbeaten after wins over Florida State, Marshall and Portland State, while the Falcons are riding high following last week\u2019s 30-23 overtime win at Colorado. Air Force won three straight in the series from 2014-16 and the last two times the teams have met on a Friday night, the Falcons have come away with the win.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nThe Air Force run game vs. Boise State\u2019s run defense. The Falcons\u2019 option attack has given teams headaches for years. Just ask Colorado, which last week gave up 289 yards on the ground to Air Force. The Falcons are averaging 6.1 yards per carry. Boise State\u2019s run defense has been solid. The Broncos are allowing only 3.5 yards per carry and have not allowed any of their opponents to rush for more than 116 yards. The last two times the Falcons beat the Broncos they rushed for more than 300 yards.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nAir Force: QB Donald Hammond II. The Falcons do most of their damage on the ground, but Hammond was excellent through the air in the upset of Colorado. Hammond was 7 of 12 for 155 yards and a pair of touchdowns, including an 81-yarder to Ben Waters.\n\nBoise State: QB Hank Bachmeier. While the freshman has played well overall, he\u2019s been especially good on third downs. Bachmeier is 21 of 29 for 356 yards, 17 first downs and three touchdowns when facing third-down situations thus far. He\u2019s also added 33 yards rushing, three first downs and a TD on third downs as well.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nBoise State has won 19 straight conference openers with its last loss in 1999 to North Texas as a member of the Big West Conference. \u2026 Air Force is 13-7 in MWC openers dating to 1999. \u2026 The Broncos only home game between Friday\u2019s game and Nov. 9 is Oct. 12 against Hawaii. \u2026 Boise State has won 115 straight home games when leading after three quarters. \u2026 Air Force\u2019s last win over a ranked team was a 27-20 victory over Boise State in 2016.
