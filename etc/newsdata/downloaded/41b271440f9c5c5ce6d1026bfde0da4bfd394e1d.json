One restaurant was even accused of paying their entire wage bill from tips.\n\nSurveys at the time showed the public strongly believed firms should not take a cut of tips, building a strong case for action to finally resolve the issue.\n\n2009 \u2013 Loophole closed but union warns staff still won\u2019t get tips\n\nLord Mandelson, a former New Labour minister.
