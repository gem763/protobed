However, that is not its current assumption.\n\nAn industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters on Sunday that Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities.\n\nPlatts said, however, that \u201cany evidence of prolonged disruption of production would heavily impact OPEC spare capacity and the ability of the IEA to use Strategic Petroleum Reserves to shore up the market\u201d.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi group claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s attacks that knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output, or more than 5% of global supply. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the assault was the work of Iran, a Houthi ally. Iran rejected the accusations.\n\nState oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day. Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days\u201d.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on.wsj.com/2NgLwg9 on Sunday that Saudi Arabia is aiming to restore a third of lost oil output by Monday.\n\nPlatts said that higher oil prices will add to the headwinds faced by the global economy.", "description": "Attacks on Saudi oil plants have boosted concerns about supply security in the Middle East and should raise the risk premium in the global crude market, shifting focus from a gloomy economic backdrop, S&P Global Platts said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
