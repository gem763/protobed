(Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBritain\u2019s top opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, faced down a rebellion on Monday, winning enough support from his party members to continue his strategy of strategic ambiguity on whether to leave the European Union.\n\nIn chaotic show of hands in a packed hall at Labour\u2019s annual conference, delegates rejected a motion calling for the party to immediately declare itself against Brexit, as many grass-roots activists had rallied for.\n\nInstead, the party will follow Corbyn\u2019s cautious plan to try to win the next general election and only then decide \u2014 by a special party conference \u2014 whether it will campaign to remain in or leave the E.U. in a new referendum.\n\nThis could be awkward. Corbyn has promised that his government would try to strike a withdrawal deal with other E.U. leaders, but he would go into negotiations with the caveat that Labour might decide to campaign against that deal in a people\u2019s vote.\n\nIt also means that Corbyn, a 70-year-old socialist and longtime Euroskeptic who ultimately voted \u201cremain\u201d in the 2016 referendum, will continue to struggle with his own mind and his inner circle.\n\nLabour has held together in fierce opposition to the maneuverings of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But three days of debate in blustery, seaside Brighton have made clear that the party is riven by divisions over Brexit and Corbyn.\n\nEven as Labour heavies laid out ambitious, self-described \u201cradical\u201d proposals \u2014 for a 32-hour workweek; for shutting down elite private colleges like Eton; for putting workers on corporate boards; for nationalizing railroads again; for banning private automobiles and saving the planet \u2014 Brexit continued to dominate the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt would be a car crash to send Jeremy Corbyn into a general election saying that he could negotiate a credible deal when our position is one to reject that deal,\u201d Howard Beckett, a leader of the Unite trade union, argued on the floor of the conference.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s wobbling on Brexit has frustrated pro-Europe, moderate Labour leaders and their supporters. They warn that such a fuzzy stance will hurt the party in upcoming elections \u2014 elections that likely to take place before the end of the year, as Johnson\u2019s government is teetering, and his majority in Parliament has slipped away.\n\n\u201cIf this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive \u2018remain\u2019 voters away,\u201d Andrew Lewin, the founder of the group Remain Labour, told the BBC.\n\nRecent polling shows Labour competitive with Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party but losing center-left support to the surging Liberal Democrats, who soundly reject Brexit.\n\nMany Labour supporters believe the party should be in a far stronger position, given that the Conservative Party has failed to deliver Brexit \u2014 or much else in the past three years.\n\nOn Sunday, Corbyn told a BBC current affairs show that a Brexit deal negotiated by a Labour government could be much better than remaining in the E.U.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently put forward what I believe to be a credible option,\u201d Corbyn said, describing a very soft Brexit that would see Britain stay closely aligned with European rules and regulations, and remain in the customs union and single market.\n\nCorbyn said that \u201cwould be a credible offer to put before the British people.\u201d\n\nBut in the debate before Monday\u2019s vote, a local Labour member from Leeds, Hannah Patterson, warned the hall that the party \u201cneeds a clear stance.\u201d It is not good enough to wait until after the election before deciding to back remain, she said.\n\nRichard Corbett, a Labour Party lawmaker in the European Parliament, told delegates that Corbyn\u2019s policy of Brexit ambiguity hasn\u2019t worked. The strategy saw Labour stumble in recent European elections, hemorrhaging votes to the Green and Liberal Democrat parties, he said.\n\nTop Labour leaders, such as Emily Thornberry and Tom Watson, have both called for the party to oppose Brexit in a fresh referendum.\n\nBut many spoke to back Corbyn\u2019s flexible position, saying it would be wrong for Labour to unilaterally declare itself against Brexit when many Labour supporters voted to leave in the June 2016 referendum.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s second-in-command, John McDonnell, said he would campaign for a remain vote in the promised referendum. But he said Corbyn\u2019s wait-and-see approach made sense. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any war in the Labour Party\u201d over Brexit, McDonnell said, just a democratic difference of opinion.\n\nRead more\n\nThe \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 teamed up to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s plans.
