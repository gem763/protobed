USA TODAY\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2013 For the longest time Saturday afternoon, it was hard to tell if Auburn vs. Florida was a struggle between dominant defenses or futile matchup of anemic offenses. The answer might have been: Both.\n\nNo. 8 Florida edged No. 7 Auburn in a bizarre, back-and-forth slugfest that defies easy description: four turnover by Florida, four by Auburn, and neither team able to seize clinching momentum \u2013 at least, until Lamical Perine\u2019s 88-yard burst down the home sideline with just more than nine minutes left finally provided the Gators room to breathe.\n\nWith that, Florida advances to the next round of the little mini-tournament this month among Auburn, Florida and LSU. At 6-0, the Gators will meet unbeaten and No. 5 LSU next week in Baton Rouge.\n\nFlorida wide receiver Freddie Swain (16) makes a reception and runs the ball for a touchdown during the first quarter against the Auburn at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.

And it came against perhaps the best defense they\u2019ll face. But the offensive performance, while gutty, doesn\u2019t inspire confidence that Florida can stick with LSU. Along with Perine\u2019s long run, the Gators got an early touchdown on a 64-yard pass off a busted coverage. Florida had some success passing \u2013 credit quarterback Kyle Trask\u2019s solid play, especially after returning after he\u2019d suffered a minor knee injury \u2013 but hadn\u2019t been able to sustain any drives. Against LSU, the Gators will need much more from the offense.\n\nBefore Perine\u2019s touchdown run, the Gators had 27 rushing yards on 24 carries. That stat includes significant sack yardage, of course \u2013 but Florida hadn\u2019t been able to run the ball much at all. Florida started from its 35 while clinging to a 17-13 lead. Perine broke a tackle from linebacker K.J. Britt just beyond the line of scrimmage, then another from safety Daniel Thomas near the 35, and then sped alone the rest of the way into the end zone.\n\nWINNING UGLY: No. 18 Michigan gets needed defeat of No. 14 Iowa\n\nDOMINANT LIONS: Penn State tops Purdue as Big Ten showdowns await\n\n- Auburn freshman quarterback Bo Nix wasn\u2019t ready for the moment, or at least not for the Gators\u2019 defense. He was 11-26 for 145 yards, with three interceptions.\n\nNix has gotten credit this season for making plays, especially during two big wins against Oregon in a neutral-site game and at Texas A&M. He\u2019s seemingly growing through the season. But in the Swamp, against the best defense he\u2019s seen \u2013 and might see all season \u2013 Nix struggled.\n\nLate in the third quarter, when Auburn\u2019s running game finally got going, the Tigers moved from their 5 into position to score the go-ahead touchdown. But a long completion to a wide-open Seth Williams was actually overthrown, or Williams would have scored. Then Nix misfired badly on a slant. Moments later, Nix was intercepted in the end zone by free safety Donovan Stiner.\n\nOn Auburn\u2019s next possession, Nix threw behind an open receiver. And on third-and-8, his scramble backward turned into a disastrous 22-yard loss, ending a promising drive.\n\nHe didn\u2019t get much help. The Tigers had trouble running all day. At halftime, Auburn had 92 yards and two first downs. Nix was 5-of-14 for 57 yards, with an interception.\n\n- The first half wasn\u2019t great football, but it was rollicking good fun. Let\u2019s recount the mistakes: Florida lost three fumbles. Auburn muffed a punt and Nix threw an interception.\n\nOh, and Florida tried an ill-advised fake punt from its own 34; punter Tommy Townsend took the snap and tried to run directly up the middle \u2026 for a loss of 2. Nix connected with Williams for a touchdown on the next play. But all of the mistakes were largely forced by two very good defenses.", "description": "Florida's defense forced four turnovers and made just enough offensive plays to beat Auburn in critical matchup of top 10 teams in the SEC.", "authors": ["George Schroeder", "Published P.M.
