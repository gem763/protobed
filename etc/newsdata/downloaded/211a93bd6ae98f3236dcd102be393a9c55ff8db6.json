Australian shares ( ) were up 0.2%.\n\nIn early European trading, the futures for pan-region ( ) were up 0.65%, ( ) 0.6%, and London's ( ) 0.52%.\n\nChinese stocks rose and the yuan hit a three-week high after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to delay an additional increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks at the request of China's Vice Premier Liu He \"as a gesture of good will.\"\n\nU.S. stock futures ( ) rose 0.38% and safe-havens such as the yen, U.S. Treasuries, and gold weakened in a sign of improving appetite for risk.\n\n\"Trump's comments are likely to put a little juice in the market, but it could be gone tomorrow,\" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management in Sydney.\n\n\"Some in the market react to small changes in negotiating positions because Trump is negotiating in the open. I'm more concerned about Brexit, because there is some complacency in the EU about this.\"\n\nOil prices rose in Asia, rebounding from a tumble on Wednesday, on hopes OPEC members will cut output to support prices.\n\nAny easing of concerns about the bruising trade war is likely to help equities extend their rally this month after a tumultuous August.\n\nInvestors also await an ECB meeting later on Thursday to see how far policymakers will go to support a flagging economy, given the risks posed by Britain's divorce from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 ( ) ended 0.72% higher on Wednesday.\n\nThe dollar briefly rose to a six-week high of 108.175 yen before paring gains slightly to trade up 0.17% at 108.030 yen.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes ( ) rose to 1.7730%, the highest in five weeks, extending a sell-off in government bonds that started on Sept. 4.\n\nfell 0.14% to $1,495.00 per ounce.\n\n(Graphic: Treasury yields and gold link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6035/5969/tsy%20yields%20ang%20gold.png)\n\nTrump's delay of additional tariffs on Chinese goods comes one day after China said it would exempt 16 types of U.S. products from import tariffs.\n\nThe world's two largest economies have been locked in protracted battle over Beijing's trade practices that has raised the spectre of a global recession.\n\nThe gestures of goodwill raise hopes both sides can narrow their differences before working-level talks resume in mid-September and high-level trade negotiations that are expected in October.\n\nIn offshore trading, the yuan rose to a three-week high of 7.0739 per dollar, while Chinese shares ( ) rose 0.66% on renewed optimism about trade talks.\n\nThe euro ( ) held steady at $1.1014 but remained near a one-week low. The ECB is set to unveil fresh stimulus measures on Thursday but its exact moves are far from clear.\n\nGermany is at risk of slipping into recession and inflation expectations sliding, but ECB President Mario Draghi, who hands over the leadership of the central bank to Christine Lagarde at the end of October, will face resistance to aggressive easing from more conservative ECB members.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2328, little changed following a 0.24% decline on Wednesday after a Scottish court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of the British Parliament was unlawful.\n\nPolitical wrangling over the terms of the UK's exit from the EU has weighed on the outlook for the British pound.\n\nU.S. crude ( ) rose 0.93% to $56.27 in Asia on the day. Futures tumbled more than 2% on Wednesday following a report that Trump is considering easing sanctions on Iran, which could potentially boost oil supplies.\n\nAsian traders were likely focused on OPEC's decision on Wednesday to cut its forecast for global oil demand in 2020. OPEC also said all producers have a shared responsibility to support the oil market.", "description": "Asian stocks at six-week highs as trade war gloom lifts before ECB", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8B01G_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
