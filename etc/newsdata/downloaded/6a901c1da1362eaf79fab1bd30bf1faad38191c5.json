He said Tuesday he hoped to discuss the situation with Chinese officials.\n\nA group of young men playing a pick-up game in Beijing on Wednesday said they were disappointed by Morey\u2019s tweet and the NBA\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can continue to watch (NBA) games,\u201d said 26-year-old Fu Hao, sweating after playing in an outdoor court.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view, if he supports the independence of Hong Kong, I feel that we should pay more attention to the CBA and less attention to the NBA, because as a Chinese we have to support our country,\u201d Fu told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Foreign firms warned \u2013\n\nHong Kong has endured nearly four months of protests that were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to the mainland.\n\nThey snowballed into a movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability, in the biggest challenge to China\u2019s rule of Hong Kong since its handover from the British in 1997.\n\nChinese state media has repeatedly warned foreign firms against speaking out or taking any actions to support the protesters, warning it could cost them access to China\u2019s market of 1.4 billion people.\n\nTech giant Apple, which has a huge presence in China, on Wednesday became the latest target.\n\nAn opinion piece in the People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, slammed a transport app available on Apple\u2019s store that it alleged helped protesters identify police in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s approval for the app obviously helps rioters,\u201d the article said. \u201cDoes this mean Apple intended to be an accomplice to the rioters?\u201d\n\nThe article then cautioned that: \u201cThe map app is just the tip of the iceberg\u201d, alleging a song supporting Hong Kong independence had also appeared on its music store..\n\n\u201cNobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cApple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision.\u201d\n\nUS jewellery brand Tiffany and Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, have also been heavily criticised in China.\n\nIn an illustration of companies trying to stay onside with China, American shoemaker Vans removed some design submissions from a competition, including one apparently praising Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters.\n\nIn a Facebook post explaining its decision last week, the firm said it had \u201cnever taken a political position\u201d, without mentioning the Hong Kong protests or China.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 China on Wednesday slammed NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s defence of free speech, cancelling a basketball fan event and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/23cece_chinese-state-accused-nba-commissioner-adam-silver-handy-us-interference-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
