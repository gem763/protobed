Under current rules, the tech firms are required to remove illegal content once they are made aware of them.\n\nIt also highlights how Europe\u2019s top court is grappling with applying the region\u2019s digital rules across the global internet after the same judges ruled last month that France\u2019s privacy watchdog could not impose some of Europe\u2019s data protection rules, in most instances, across Google\u2019s global empire.\n\nWhile the Luxembourg-based court highlighted that such global takedowns from Facebook\u2019s networks could only be permitted under specific circumstances, including being linked to court decisions, policymakers in Brussels and Washington, DC are now working to tighten rules on how platforms police their content online.\n\n\u201cThis is an important ruling,\u201d said Sebastian Schwemer, a researcher at the Center for Information and Innovation Law at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cIt will play into the wider debates about companies\u2019 monitoring obligations of online content.\u201d\n\nTargeted monitoring\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in 2016 by Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, an Austrian lawmaker, who had requested that Facebook delete defamatory posts made about her by an anonymous user.\n\nWhen an Austrian court sided with her, the company initially only removed the content from being viewed in Austria, but subsequent appeals had focused on whether such takedowns should apply globally, and if Facebook should be required to remove similar content once it has been made aware of the defamatory material.\n\nFollowing the ruling by Europe\u2019s highest court, her case will now be referred back to Austrian judges, who will make the final ruling about how to apply Thursday\u2019s decision.\n\nDigital rights campaigners criticized the decision against Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision opens the door for serious restrictions on freedom of expression due to the takedown of legitimate speech. Extending removal to the vague concept of \u201cequivalent\u201d content is harmful because the context as well as motivation of users re-sharing content may significantly differ with each re-upload,\u201d said Eli\u0161ka P\u00edrkov\u00e1, Europe policy analyst at Access Now, a campaigning group.\n\nThe planned future legislation on illegal content online is described by the European Commission\u2019s Digital department as a way to bridge regulatory and enforcement gaps.\n\nThe Luxembourg-based judges said their ruling would not force companies to actively monitor all material that was posted on their platforms, as Europe's current rules specifically prevent \u201cgeneral monitoring obligations.\u201d\n\nInstead, any monitoring of potentially harmful material should be linked to existing rulings from courts and be limited to specific cases of harmful material like social media posts that defamed individuals. Those restrictions, the court said, would ensure people\u2019s freedom of expression was not hampered by the widespread monitoring of their online activities.\n\nThe court \"assumes that a hosting platform can technically perform all this in quite a straightforward fashion for any type of right, but it is likely that some issues will arise in practice,\u201d said Eleanora Rosati, an associate professor in intellectual property law at the Stockholm University.\n\nPaving the way for Digital Services Act\n\nThe incoming European Commission has outlined plans for a so-called Digital Services Act, which is expected to include new responsibilities for online platforms over the types of content that is posted and shared online. American lawmakers are similarly discussing new legislation as current rules in both Europe and the United States mostly allow tech firms to side step responsibility for such material.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s CJEU ruling has clarified that nothing in the e-commerce directive prevents the global application. It is limited to court orders and doesn't apply to other forms of notice by users alleging content are illegal,\u201d a spokesperson for the Commission said.\n\nThat follows widespread criticism that Facebook, Google and Twitter have allowed hateful, terrorist and false information to spread widely across their global networks.\n\nThe companies deny wrongdoing, but have been actively taking steps \u2013 through the use of content moderators and technology like machine learning \u2013 to clamp down on the worst online offenders.\n\nThe planned future legislation on illegal content online is described by the European Commission\u2019s digital department as a way to bridge regulatory and enforcement gaps.\n\nEurope\u2019s highest court also took aim at the region\u2019s implementation of existing rules that oversee how platforms like Facebook can be held responsible for online material.\n\n\u201cExisting and emerging divergences in the legislations and jurisprudence of member states in the field of intermediary liability hinder the good functioning of the single market,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
