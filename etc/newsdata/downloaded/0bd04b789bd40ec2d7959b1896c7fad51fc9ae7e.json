Joe Manchin said Wednesday that Beto O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t coming anywhere near his guns after the 2020 presidential hopeful announced his plan for a mandatory, federal assault weapons \u201cbuyback.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeto\u2019s one human being. He gave his own opinion, OK?\u201d the West Virginia senator told The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Lindsay Wise.\n\n\u201cI think it was very harmful to make it look like all the Democrats,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cI can tell you one thing: Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that, OK?\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke has proposed that, if elected president, he would use local law enforcement to ensure that all Americans turn their \u201cassault weapons\u201d over to the federal government.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d the former congressman declared during last week\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nThe proposal has troubled more moderate Democrats such as presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who said it plays into the hands of Republicans who want to paint the party as anti-Second Amendment. Other candidates, such as Sen. Kamala Harris, have called the buyback a good idea.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday called Mr. O\u2019Rourke a \u201cdummy\u201d for the proposal.\n\n\u201cDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cConvinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away.
