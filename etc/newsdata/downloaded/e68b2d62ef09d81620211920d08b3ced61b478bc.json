The documentary provides an immersive look at what happened that tumultuous summer when police raided an after hours party at the intersection of 12th Street and Clairmount. Directed by Brain Kaufman, \u201c12th and Clairmount\u201d utilizes more than 400 reels of Detroiters' home movies and other archival video and photos. It was produced by Kathy Kieliszewski and Bill McGraw of the Free Press in collaboration with Bridge Magazine and WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) and a group of metro Detroit cultural institutions, led by the Detroit Institute of Arts. The film premiered at the 2017 Freep Film Festival, where it sold out four screenings, and went on to play film festivals around the country.\n\n\"The Wall\" is part of the Arizona Republic and USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s Pulitzer-prize winning project that takes an in-depth look at the real-world implications of installing President Donald Trump's proposed border wall. Journalists from the Arizona Republic and across the USA TODAY NETWORK traveled the full length of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border to examine the possible effects of a wall on security, communities, commerce, the environment, immigrants and property rights. The feature-length film from the multiplatform report, which took home the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, features rare footage from some of the most remote reaches of the U.S. \u2013 from the canyons of Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park to the Southern Arizona desert as Border Patrol agents recover bodies from the desert. Directed by Brian Kaufman and produced by Kathy Kieliszewski, Emmanuel Lozano and Josh Susong, the film was screened on multiple dates in cities across the country last year.\n\n\u201cWe are so excited to be able to share this engaging and educational content with such a wide audience of viewers on Amazon\u2019s streaming platform,\u201d said Kate Gutman, Head of Content Ventures, Gannett. \u201cThis is a notable opportunity to expand our distribution reach with the goal of furthering the impact of our fantastic journalism.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/06/26/gannett-distributes-two-usa-today-network-documentaries-streaming-amazon-prime-video/1569245001/", "description": "\u201c12th and Clairmount\u201d and \u201cThe Wall\u201d are now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
