The U.S. and Japan have reached an initial trade agreement this week, according to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe numbers: The advance trade deficit in goods widened to $72.8 in August, up 0.5% from the prior month, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s advanced estimate released Thursday. That was smaller than the $74 billion estimate of economists polled by MarketWatch. The report is used by the government to better measure GDP.\n\nThe government\u2019s advance report on wholesale inventories showed a 0.4% gain in August. Advanced retail inventories were flat as were retail inventories excluding autos.\n\nWhat happened: Both imports and exports rose in August, but imports rose at a faster pace.\n\nThe gain in exports was led by vehicles and industrial supplies, which includes oil. This offset a drop in the capital goods component.\n\nAt the same time, the gain in imports were led by consumer goods. Imports may have risen slightly after President Donald Trump announced on Aug. 1 that the U.S. would slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods starting at the beginning of September.\n\nThe advance indicators are part of a flurry of data Thursday that could alter economists expectations of third quarter GDP growth. Prior to the data, economists projected that GDP would expand at a 2.1% annual rate in the third quarter, almost at the same pace as the 2% rate in the April-June quarter.\n\nThe recent trend shows the goods deficit has not been surging.\n\nWhat are they saying? \u201cThe data suggest a slight drag on third-quarter GDP from net exports after allowing for price changes,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\nBig picture: The trade deficit doesn\u2019t capture the fact that world trade volumes are falling thanks to the trade war with China and China\u2019s cyclical slowdown, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. This will ultimately slow U.S. export growth.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have to expect net trade to be a drag on GDP growth through the year-end and into 2020,\u201d Shepherdson said in a note to clients.\n\nMarket reaction: Stocks DJIA, -0.39% opened lower Thursday on signs that the U.S. and China may try to ease trade tensions.", "description": "The advanced trade deficit in goods widened 0.5% to $72.8 billion in August, the Commerce Department said Thursday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS069_japan__ZG_20190925163025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
