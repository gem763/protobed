A party sounds like fun, so let's check out the charts of PRTY.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of PRTY, below, we can see how prices have worked lower and lower the past 12 months. For much of that time, prices have been below the declining 50-day moving average line. The line is starting to bottom and prices are above the average line.\n\nThe slower 200-day moving average line is declining and intersects above $8. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is overall bearish, but it has improved a bit the past four weeks. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing the zero-line from below for an outright go-long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of PRTY, below, we can see a longer-term downtrend in effect that has taken prices from $18 down to around $4. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is weak and the MACD oscillator may signal a cover-shorts buy signal.\n\nThis Point and Figure chart of PRTY, below, shows a possible upside price target near $10, however, a base pattern is missing, in my opinion.\n\nBottom line strategy: Will Halloween give PRTY a lift? I don't know, but chart resistance in the $7-$9 area is likely to be a problem.", "description": "Chart resistance in the $7-$9 area and a lack of a base pattern are likely problems for the company Party City....MIK", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Charts Put A Damper On Party City", "Chart Resistance In The", "Area", "A Lack Of A Base Pattern Are Likely Problems For Investors.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Timothy Collins", "Jonathan Heller", "James", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/partycitynyse.jpg"}
