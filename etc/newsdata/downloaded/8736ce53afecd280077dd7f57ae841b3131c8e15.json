Yet the grievances that led them to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods remain largely unresolved.\n\nThe administration agreed to suspend a tariff hike on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports that was set to take effect Tuesday. And China agreed to buy up to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.\n\nThe de-escalation in tension between the world\u2019s two largest economies was welcomed by financial markets. The U.S.-China hostilities have alarmed investors and escalated costs and uncertainties for many businesses.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the cease-fire in a White House meeting with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. The news followed two days of talks in Washington, the 13th round of negotiations between the two countries\u2019 delegations.\n\n\u201cIt took us a long time to get here, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be great for China and great for the USA,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMany of the details, though, remained to be worked out. And some of the thorniest issues \u2014 such as U.S. allegations that China forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets \u2014 were dealt with only partially, or not at all, and will require further talks.\n\n\u201cThe president is acting as if a lot of Chinese concessions have been nailed down, and they just haven\u2019t,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe negotiators have so far reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed.\n\nAnd the threat of escalation still hangs over the two countries: Trump has yet to drop plans to impose tariffs that are set to take effect Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products \u2014 a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States.\n\nWhile providing scant details of what was agreed to Friday, the White House said Beijing pledged to be more transparent about how it sets the value of its currency, the yuan. The administration has long accused China of manipulating the yuan lower to give its exporters a competitive edge in foreign markets.\n\nChina has also agreed to open its markets to U.S. banks and other financial services providers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\n\nThe trade war has inflicted an economic toll on both countries. U.S. manufacturers have been deeply hurt by rising costs from the tariffs and by uncertainty over when and how the trade hostilities may end. Friday\u2019s truce at least opens the door to progress.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to de-escalate,\u201d said Timothy Keeler, a former chief of staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives. \u201cI think it serves both sides\u2019 interests because both sides were feeling pain.\u201d\n\nStock prices had been up substantially all day, mainly in anticipation of a significant trade agreement. But once the White House announced the contours of the tentative accord, the market shed some of its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 500 points at its high, closed up 319.\n\n\u201cThis is an encouraging first phase,\u201d said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. \u201cWe await word on how implementation will be measured and in what timeframe, as well as details on scheduling subsequent phases.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Chinese negotiators didn\u2019t deal this week with a major dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Huawei, saying it poses a threat to national security because its equipment can be used for espionage. Trump has said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in the trade talks.\n\nThe administration still has in place tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. What changed Friday was that Trump suspended plans to raise existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products from 25% to 30% next week.\n\nBeijing has lashed back by taxing about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on soybeans and other agricultural products in a shot at Trump supporters in rural America.\n\nLast year, U.S. farm exports to China plummeted 53% to less than $9.2 billion. The additional Chinese purchases that were promised Friday could provide an economic boost to hard-hit U.S. farmers.\n\nThe two sides were close to a more comprehensive deal in early May. But talks stalled after the administration accused China of reneging on earlier commitments. Trump acknowledged that Friday\u2019s deal has yet to be put down on paper but said that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\n\u201cChina wants it badly, and we want it also,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.\u201d\n\nMyron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, drew encouragement from Friday\u2019s developments.\n\n\u201cFinally, a ray of hope for the U.S.-China trade relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile there remains significant work ahead to address many of the most important U.S. trade and investment priorities, we will continue to lend our full support.\u201d\n\nStill, Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, suggested that the partial nature of the deal won\u2019t relieve much of the uncertainty surrounding trade policy that has discouraged many American companies from investing in new equipment and expanding.\n\n\u201cFor businesses this will mean less damage, not greater certainty \u2026 \u201cBeyond the promises and niceties, the deal doesn\u2019t address key underlying issues,\u201d Daco said in a research note.\n\nThe two countries are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration\u2019s assertions that China deploys predatory tactics \u2014 including outright theft \u2014 in a sharp-elbowed drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.\n\nBeijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China\u2019s aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Christopher Rugaber and Bani Sapra contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration and China declared a temporary truce Friday in their 15-month trade war.
