They limit North Korea's oil imports and impose bans linked to its exports of coal, fish and textiles.\n\nSince the US-North Korea talks began, Russia and China have been calling for the UN to start lifting sanctions so as to create momentum towards the North's denuclearisation. But the United States has refused.", "description": "North Korean and US officials on Saturday gathered for new nuclear talks in Stockholm after months of deadlock and Pyongyang's defiant test of a sea-launched ballistic missile this week.
