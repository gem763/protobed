He apparently thought wrong.\n\nWhile sitting in as the lone male guest-host of Outnumbered\u2014a woman-led daytime talk show\u2014Sexton joined forces with co-hosts Dagen McDowell and Melissa Francis in ridiculing NBC News for launching a \u201cclimate confessions\u201d section.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a religious belief for people who think they\u2019re too smart for religion,\u201d Sexton declared. \u201cThey\u2019re asking for forgiveness. Do you think there is a world where it makes a difference?\u201d\n\nAfter Francis took an additional shot at NBC for their climate-change section, asserting that people \u201creally don\u2019t love sanctimony,\u201d Sexton took the opportunity to take aim at Thunberg, who recently called on Congress to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d on climate change.\n\n\u201cThe biggest weakness this stuff always has is the spokespersons for this movement. They also have this young girl who is, what, 16? We gonna ask her about the Fed rate next?\u201d he snarked.\n\nImmediately, all three co-hosts, two of whom are overtly right-leaning, took Sexton to task for making fun of a teenager.\n\n\u201cNo picking on children,\u201d Francis exclaimed.\n\nDagen McDowell added: \u201cShe\u2019s a kid!\u201d\n\nSexton, meanwhile, insisted he was not picking on Thurnberg but just expressing that he felt it was ridiculous for her to testify about climate change in front of Congress, prompting more shout-downs from the panel.\n\n\u201cNo kid bashing,\u201d Francis declared.\n\nLiberal co-host Jessica Tarlov reiterated Francis\u2019 point, further noting that Sexton shouldn\u2019t be so cavalier to ridicule a \u201ckid who is more alert to the challenges facing our planet than a great number of people.\u201d", "description": "\u201cNo picking on children,\u201d Melissa Francis exclaimed, while Dagen McDowell added: \u201cShe\u2019s a kid!\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568915963/outnumbered_27_zq9fkx", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
