Beto O'Rourke is all-in on guns. And Sen. Bernie Sanders is starting to go at central questions of electability with former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, has emerged as a leading contender -- if not the favorite -- for the Democratic nomination. Plans and selfies have gotten her to this point, with a slow-but-steady rise that's made her the central figure in the primary race at the moment.\n\nScott Kowalchyk/CBS\n\nWith that comes new scrutiny that will gather around Warren this weekend in Iowa, where the major candidates are gathering for a series of events starting on Friday. Policy scrutiny of Warren is now coming from Stephen Colbert and some of her Democratic rivals, who are taking note of her non-answer when it comes to raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nThat scrutiny will stretch to her home state of Massachusetts, where a former student, Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, will announce a primary challenge on Saturday against Sen. Ed Markey, whose reelection Warren has endorsed. It will also be present in Warren's native Oklahoma, where Sanders will notably campaign Sunday.\n\nPolls and crowd sizes have converged to put Warren in the middle of the conversation. Now we'll see if she has a plan for that, too.\n\nBrian Cahn/Zuma Press\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nThousands of people from over 150 countries around the world are expected to participate in the \"Global Climate Strike\" on Friday. The list of co-sponsors for the domestic events alone is pages long and includes leading environmental advocacy organizations, faith-based organizations, for-profit business and political groups.\n\nAccording to the strike's organizers hundreds of businesses in the U.S. -- Patagonia, Lush, Seventh Generation and Kickstarter -- will also close their doors, set up stations to support protesters or turn their screens green in solidarity.\n\nNew York City announced that public school students could skip classes and join marches without fear of repercussions. At least three 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have said formally that they plan to attend local protests as well.\n\nSarah Silbiger/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe strike comes on the eve of a major U.N. Climate Summit in New York on Monday, following a brutal summer of extreme weather. Earlier this week, the Trump administration talked publicly about revoking California's regulatory waiver, which has allowed it to set separate, higher auto-emission and electric vehicle standards. The move is perhaps -- again -- a sign of this White House standing as an outlier on the global stage.\n\nThe TIP with Averi Harper\n\nAs Sanders hits the campaign trail in Iowa this weekend, he may be packing some sharper critiques for Biden. In an Instagram post on Thursday, the senator slammed the former vice president, who has consistently led in the polls.\n\n\"I like Joe, I've known him for many, many years. And the truth is he is against Trump, in my view, not a strong candidate,\" said Sanders. Later adding, \"To beat Trump you need energy, excitement, large voter turnout. I think it is very hard to make the case that Joe Biden can generate that kind of energy.\"\n\nSanders claims that Biden's platform doesn't speak to issues that people are concerned about, such as \"Medicare for All,\" racism, college affordability and climate change. In the past, Sanders has limited his criticism of Biden to policy. The social media post could indicate a shift in Sanders' strategy as he fights to stay near the top of the 2020 candidates in the polls.\n\nDavid J.
