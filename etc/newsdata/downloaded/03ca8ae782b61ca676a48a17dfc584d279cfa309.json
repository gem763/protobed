Who is she trying to kid?\n\nDespite the breathless commentary about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president and a whistleblower report based on second-hand accounts of uncertain credibility, we know little about what transpired, much less whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Democrats could have gone through the normal procedures to get the information from the White House rather than jump immediately to talk of impeachment.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 impeachment frenzy didn\u2019t result from this news. It\u2019s been in full flower since before Trump was even elected. Heck, there were calls for his impeachment before he\u2019d even secured the Republican nomination.\n\nHere\u2019s just a partial timeline of the many previous calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment that turned out to be frivolous:\n\nMarch 2016: After just 15 states had held their Republican primaries, The New York Daily News ran an editorial with the headline \u201cImpeach Trump.\u201d\n\nApril 2016: Politico ran a story headlined: \u201cCould Trump Be Impeached Shortly After He Takes Office?\u201d It starts by saying that, \u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t even the Republican nominee yet. But \u2026 \u2018impeachment\u2019 is already on the lips of pundits, newspaper editorials, constitutional scholars, and even a few members of Congress.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2017: The same day Trump was inaugurated, the Washington Post ran a story saying that the \u201ceffort to impeach Trump is already underway.\u201d\n\nFeb 2017: An impeach Trump online campaign already had attracted 650,000 signatures.\n\nApril 2017: Rep. Maxine Waters leads an \u201cimpeach Trump\u201d chant.\n\nNovember 2017: Six House members introduced articles of impeachment against Trump, claiming he obstructed justice, violated the Constitution\u2019s foreign emoluments clause, and undermined the federal judiciary process and the press.\n\nMay 2018: Rep. Al Green says \u201cthere\u2019s a good likelihood there will be articles of impeachment\u201d brought against Trump if Democrats reclaim the House.\n\nJune 2018: Five months before she was elected to the House, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Trump should be impeached, claiming, \u201cThere are serious grounds in violations of the Emoluments Clause from day one.\u201d\n\nJuly 2018: After Trump\u2019s Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin, Democrats declared that his conduct was grounds for impeachment. Former CIA Director John Brennan tweeted that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of \u2018high crimes & misdemeanors.'\u201d \u201cIt was nothing short of treasonous.\u201d\n\nDecember 2018: Rep. Jerry Nadler says Trump could be impeached for the alleged payoffs to porn star Stormy Daniels. \u201cCertainly they\u2019d be impeachable offenses because even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office,\u201d he asserted.\n\nAnd all this, of course, was before Special Counsel Robert Mueller released his findings on the Russia investigation, which took the wind out of the sails of the impeach Trump crowd. Now, conveniently enough, a new charge emerges.\n\nMore broadly, Democrats have a long history of rushing to impeach Republicans, as IBD editorials noted when impeachment frenzy was in the air in November 2017.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Pelosi\u2019s decision isn\u2019t significant; opening an impeachment investigation is a big deal, no matter what your political stripes. Nor is any of this to say that an investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian president isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nBut you will have to pardon us if we aren\u2019t swept up in the latest round of the Democrats\u2019 impeach Trump mania, before there\u2019s any actual evidence of wrongdoing or obstruction, only plenty of hopeful speculation from Trump\u2019s harshest critics \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 who\u2019ve never been able to accept the fact that he won the election.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
