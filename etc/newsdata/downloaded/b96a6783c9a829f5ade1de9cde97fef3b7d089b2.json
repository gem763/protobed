Choir! plans to stage a concert at the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday.\n\nA post on ticketing site Eventbrite says singers of all levels can participate in the show, which will take place in two locations at the same time \u2014 at Border Field State Park in San Diego, and in the nearby Mexican border town of Tijuana.\n\nCanadian artists Nobu Adilman and Daveed Goldman founded Choir! Choir! Choir!\n\nThe two invite strangers to gather at drop-in sessions around North America to learn harmonies and sing a designated song in concert together for free.\n\nUp to 500 participants will be able to gather at the event in San Diego and about 300 in Tijuana.\n\nTijuana Eventos, an event site for Tijuana, Mexico has tweeted about the gathering. (@tijuanaeventos/Twitter)\n\nAdilman, who is usually the group's conductor, says he'll be onstage leading the singers in Tijuana while Goldman does the same and plays an acoustic guitar with those in San Diego.\n\nThey'll all sing With a Little Help from My Friends by the Beatles.\n\n\"We're not trying to make this a political event,\" Adilman said in a phone interview.\n\n\"The event is about communication; it's about keeping doors open and keeping the conversation going. We're better when we come together to celebrate each other, and just the simple act of singing together is a jumping-off point for so many beautiful ways to connect, beyond the singing.\"\n\nAdilman said they plan to shoot video of the event with the organization ArtPower.\n\nI hope some of you on here, live close enough to San Diego or Tijuana, to be able attend what looks like what will be an amazing participatory event. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/choirchoirchoir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@choirchoirchoir</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZTjAj5Atzf\">https://t.co/ZTjAj5Atzf</a> \u2014@vanderDonkCarin\n\nThe Eventbrite invitation says online registration is required but does not guarantee admission.\n\nIt says the purpose is to \"celebrate the unique friendship, culture and community we share in the border region of San Diego and Tijuana.\"\n\n\"There are few places on earth so scenic where you can gather people from two countries at once to create beautiful music together and share in how special it is to be in this particular place in the world,\" says the Eventbrite post.\n\n\"While we will be divided by the physical border, music knows no boundaries and our voices together will transcend barriers.\"", "description": "The Canadian choral cover group Choir!
