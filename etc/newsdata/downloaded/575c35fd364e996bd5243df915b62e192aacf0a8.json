He attributed his loss to a concerted campaign by Quebec dairy farmers who were upset that he was proposing to end the supply management system that regulates the price of eggs, dairy and poultry.\n\nBernier founded his own party soon after, declaring the Conservatives to be \"intellectually and morally corrupt'' and lacking in true conservative principles.\n\nThe PPC leader campaigned against what he calls \"extreme multiculturalism,'' promising to cut immigration levels and ensure new arrivals respond to Canada's economic needs.\n\nThe 56-year-old faced criticism during the campaign for tweets describing 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg as mentally unstable, although he later softened his comments.\n\nPeople's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier lost his seat in the riding of Beauce. He gave a concession speech to supporters in Beauceville, Que. 5:11\n\nLate last week, The Globe and Mail reported that strategist Warren Kinsella and his firm Daisy Group were hired to \"seek and destroy'' Bernier's party and portray its supporters as racist.\n\nThe Globe has reported the client was the Conservatives, although Scheer has refused to confirm, deny or even acknowledge the report.\n\nBernier, who filed a complaint with Elections Canada over the affair, suggested that Kinsella's campaign might have had a hand in the satirical Rhinoceros Party's decision to field a candidate also named Maxime Bernier in the Beauce, in the hope of confusing voters. The Rhinos' Bernier won 1,063 votes, or 1.8 per cent of all votes cast in the riding.\n\nWhile the PPC ran candidates in almost every riding, the party struggled to break through, and it was polling below three per cent in most opinion surveys.\n\nLehoux, a former dairy farmer, said last week he was running against not just Bernier, but against the PPC leader's father, as well.\n\nGilles Bernier, who represented Beauce for the Progressive Conservatives from 1984 to 1993 and then as an Independent until 1997, continues to be a presence in the riding, Lehoux said.\n\nLehoux said voters felt pressure to stay loyal to the family.\n\n\"People have a lot of respect for Gilles,'' Lehoux said. \"But I tell them, 'I trust you \u2014 on voting day it will be just you in the booth. No one else will know.'\"", "description": "Conservative candidate Richard Lehoux, a former dairy farmer, trounced Bernier, who left the Conservatives to form his own right-wing party after losing last year's leadership race.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5329945.1571722235!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bernier.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
