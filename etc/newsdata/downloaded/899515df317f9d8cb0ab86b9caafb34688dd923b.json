Definitely the bank earnings have been terrific, relative to expectations,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\n\nAlso supporting sentiment was the Chinese Commerce Ministry saying it hoped to reach a phased agreement in a protracted trade dispute with the United States and cancel tariffs as soon as possible.\n\nRising uncertainties around the U.S.-China trade war, increasing geopolitical risks and weak domestic economic indicators have recently hit sentiment, with investors now focusing on third-quarter earnings for clarity on these factors impacting Corporate America.\n\nAnalysts are expecting S&P 500 third-quarter earnings to fall by 3%, which would mark the first year-on-year contraction since the earnings recession that ended in 2016.\n\nHowever, of the 43 S&P 500 companies to have posted quarterly results so far, 86% have beaten expectations.\n\nAt 8:34 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 64 points, or 0.24%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 8.25 points, or 0.28% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 30.5 points, or 0.38%.\n\nAmong other stocks, International Business Machines Corp slipped 6% after it missed quarterly revenue estimates due to weakness in its global technology services unit.\n\nInvestors also targeted industrial earnings, which have been a mixed bag so far.\n\nCSX Corp shares rose 2.5% after the railroad operator beat quarterly profit expectations, while peer Union Pacific Corp fell 2.8% on missing earning estimates.\n\nHoneywell International Inc cut its full-year sales forecast, as its customers limited spending amid a slowing global economy. Shares of the diversified manufacturer inched 0.3% higher.
