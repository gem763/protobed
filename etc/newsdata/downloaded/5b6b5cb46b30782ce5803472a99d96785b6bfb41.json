It is the largest and most complex royal commission ever undertaken in New Zealand, and has been plagued by issues since its inception, including the resignation of its chair, Sir Anand Satyanand, last month.\n\nNow, survivors say they feel re-traumatised after it was revealed they unwittingly ate, drank and shared a motel with a man convicted of historical sex crimes against a child. The man was the partner of one of the survivor advisory group members, and drove her to meetings, and socialised with survivors outside official meetings.\n\nData breach and delay: survivors lose faith in New Zealand's landmark child abuse inquiry Read more\n\nA spokesperson for the royal commission said commissioners were made aware of the man\u2019s criminal background on 22 August, but survivors who had unknowingly spent time with the offender were not informed until 24 September when media reports emerged.\n\n\u201cThat is probably one of the worst possible scenarios for people who\u2019ve been through abuse. I\u2019m horrified,\u201d said Jane Stevens, a survivor of abuse and an advisory group member.\n\nStevens told RNZ the revelation had left her feeling physically sick. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s good enough for it to be treated as a learning, because I do feel re-victimised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely shocked that we\u2019ve known nothing about this and I hear it on the radio. It\u2019s not good enough.\u201d\n\nThe royal commission spokesperson said that at no time did the man attend official survivors\u2019 meetings, although survivors have said he did eat with them, and spent a night in a motel with them.\n\nCommissioner Paul Gibson has said the nature of the inquiry meant many of the people it was dealing with had criminal convictions.\n\nA royal commission spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe acknowledge the distress that some survivors may feel about this but want to assure them that this won\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cWe have a new manager of the survivor advisory group who has begun the process of vetting the members.\u201d\n\nTracey Martin, the internal affairs and children\u2019s minister, has called an urgent meeting with the inquiry commissioners, and has refused to rule out sackings.\n\nJustice minister Andrew Little said he was \u201cstunned\u201d to hear of what happened. \u201cThe reality is when you\u2019re dealing with survivors of sexual abuse you don\u2019t mix them up with a sexual abuser.\u201d\n\nSimon Bridges, the leader of the opposition National party, said the fiasco was \u201c an abhorrent and gross breach of trust by government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the biggest inquiries in New Zealand history, it will cost $78m,\u201d said Bridges. \u201cThe highly respected chair has resigned, there have been a range of other issues, and now this. How can anyone now have confidence in this royal commission? The minister must explain.\u201d", "description": "Abuse victims shared meals and a motel with man convicted of historical crimes against children", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c250f722431bad300c7abe35b3b6e33973b155f/40_163_3314_1988/master/3314.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a54c78e2ac56648a9de3860299ddba6e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
