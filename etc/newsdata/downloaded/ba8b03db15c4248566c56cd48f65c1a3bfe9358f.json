Australia has a large Chinese diaspora.\n\n\u201cOur issue is not with the Chinese people, not with the amazing Chinese diaspora community we have here in Australia, my issue is with the Communist Party of China and their policies to the extent that they\u2019re inconsistent with our own values,\u201d Dutton said in the ABC report.\n\n\u201cWe have a very important trading relationship with China but we won\u2019t allow university students to be unduly influenced,\u201d Dutton said, adding he would name bad state actors to advance Australia\u2019s \u201cnational interest.\u201d\n\nABC reported that the Australian government has had a mixed response to Chinese threats:\n\nLast month Prime Minister Scott Morrison declined to confirm if China was behind a cyber attack on Canberra\u2019s Parliament House ahead of the May election, after reports emerged intelligence officials had concluded that was the case. The Federal Government has been more proactive in tackling foreign influence on university campuses, recently creating a task force to investigate it.\n\nThe Chinese have responded to Dutton\u2019s stance in a statement issued by its embassy, according to the ABC report.\n\n\u201cWe categorically reject Mr. Dutton\u2019s irrational accusations against China, which are shocking and baseless,\u201d the Chinese embassy said in a statement. \u201cWe strongly condemn his malicious slur on the Communist Party of China, which constitutes an outright provocation to the Chinese people.\n\n\u201cSuch ridiculous rhetoric severely harms the mutual trust between China and Australia and betrays the common interests of the two peoples,\u201d the statement said.\n\nImmigration Minister David Coleman and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg agreed that, in many cases, China\u2019s values were inconsistent with Australia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAustralia and China have very different political systems and that\u2019s abundantly clear,\u201d Frydenberg said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Australia\u2019s Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said he will \u201ccall out\u201d China for \u201cforeign interference in universities\u201d and cyber attacks.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1070877454-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
