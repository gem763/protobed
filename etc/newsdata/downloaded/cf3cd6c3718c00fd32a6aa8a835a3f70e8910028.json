The rally coincides with a flurry of short covering that comes a week before the record date for an exotic dividend the company unveiled to much fanfare and confusion last month.\n\nOverstock\u2019s flamboyant founder may be gone, having stepped down Aug. 22 after saying he got enmeshed in a government spy probe, but vestiges of his two-decade-long war with detractors linger. The latest twists have been manna for the stock\u2019s true-believer longs, kicking up Twitter skirmishes while pushing the envelope of another Byrne obsession, blockchain.\n\nData from S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm, show that about 6% of the 13.2 million shares borrowed by people betting against Overstock have been bought back in the past three business days. Shares fell for the first time in eight days Friday in volume that was three times the recent average.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a serious acceleration of short covering just recently,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3. \u201cTo have that much short covering in that amount of time is responding to an event that\u2019s changing people\u2019s trading strategies.\u201d\n\nIn a short sale, a bearish trader sells borrowed stock, hoping to buy it back at a lower price, return it and pocket the difference. Frantic buying to close such positions is termed a \u201csqueeze\u201d and can boost shares rapidly.\n\nWhile other reasons may exist for the rally, one explanation centers on a blockchain-based \u201cdigital security\u201d that Overstock said on July 30 it would grant to shareholders of record on Sept. 23 as a dividend. Because the security could prove hard for others to lay hands on, the potential exists for it to snarl the process by which shorts maintain positions.\n\nStocks all over America have been benefiting last week from rushed purchases by bears as equities marched back toward records. Overstock\u2019s case may be different. Its 65% rally since Sept. 3 stands out even in a market as volatile as this one.\n\nThe theory behind the squeeze is technical but comes down to the obligation a short seller faces to pass dividends back to whomever lent him shares. That may prove difficult in Overstock\u2019s case because the so-called \u201cDigital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock\u201d it promised in July is unregistered, will trade only on a blockchain exchange owned by a subsidiary, and may face restrictions on transfer.\n\n\u201cYou can expect a lot of buy-to-covers before the record day,\u201d said Dusaniwsky. The 764,000 shares bought back since Sept. 10 are \u201cthe tip of the iceberg if people are wary of how the dividend settles out,\u201d he said.\n\nPressure on shorts would conceivably ease if the firms that lent shares were to accept something else in lieu of Overstock\u2019s digital security -- cash, for instance. Dusaniwsky said brokerages he\u2019s spoken to \u201care trying to figure out\u201d how to handle it.\n\nA spokeswoman for Nasdaq, the exchange where Overstock shares trade, declined to comment. Overstock didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex situation and we\u2019re trying to help our clients figure out the best course of action,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. As for the rally, he said: \u201cIf you\u2019re short the stock, how are you going to deliver crypto? You have no way of delivering it, so you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, well I have to cover this stock because I can\u2019t deliver the dividend.\u201d\u2019\n\nWhatever\u2019s causing it, a rally this extreme puts anyone betting against a stock in difficult straits. That\u2019s unlikely to bother Byrne, the 56-year-old founder who over the years espoused conspiracy theories about Wall Street and the evil \u201cSith Lord\u201d hedge fund manager who conspired to take him down.\n\nUntil recently, parts of the bear case on Overstock were Byrne himself. Before stepping down, he claimed in a series of public announcements that entanglements with the \u201cdeep state\u201d that included cooperating with law enforcement agents he called \u201cMen in Black\u201d with their \u201cClinton Investigation\u201d and \u201cRussia Investigation.\u201d Byrne said he\u2019d been romantically involved with Maria Butina, a Russian operative jailed for failing to register as a foreign agent.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- One of Patrick Byrne\u2019s last acts at Overstock.com Inc. is making life difficult for the short sellers he was forever battling.Shares of the online merchant are on a tear, up about 60% in two weeks.
