(Image: Hulu)\n\nRunaways is one of the only live-action shows that\u2019s ever been bold enough to feature a CGI (but sometimes practically made) dinosaur that against all odds winds up looking pretty damned good on screen, even when it\u2019s interacting with living actors. The creative team behind the series obviously knows that Old Lace is one of its strengths, and from the looks of things, the deinonychus is going to have even more chances to shine in the upcoming season.\n\nRunaways\u2019 season two finale left both the heroic teens and their villainous parents at a crossroads, as Jonah revealed his true intentions were to give his alien family a means of possessing a number of unsuspecting humans.
