They told him to follow them to the police station, without giving him any explanation.\n\nSoon after, Niyazi was gone. He did not even get to say goodbye to his wife, Isarhan Ehmet, who returned home later that day and wondered why her husband had suddenly disappeared.\n\nNiyazi is among hundreds of thousands thought swept up in the mass detention of Turkic-speaking Muslims across China's westernmost territory.\n\nEven his \"elite\" status as a local communist official was no protection.\n\nOther exiled Uighurs who spoke to Al Jazeera also said that their relatives, who had been loyal to the Communist Party for years, met the same fate as Niyazi. Now they are calling on the international community to put more pressure of Beijing to release their family members.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, at least one million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are being held in detention. The number represents about 12.5 percent of the estimated eight million Uighurs in China.\n\nChina has denied that Uighurs are being held against their will. Beijing has described the facilities as \"training centres\" or \"re-education\" camps aimed at countering the \"terrorist threat\" and \"extremism\" in Xinjiang.\n\nUighurs work at a roadside in Shayar County east of the city of Aksu in Xinjiang last September [File: Hector Retamal/AFP]\n\nEinar Tangen, a political analyst who advises the Chinese government, also told Al Jazeera that Beijing considers the re-education and training a necessary measure to address poverty.\n\n\"This is not something that they are doing because they are trying to be mean to the Uighurs. They actually think that this is helping,\" he said.\n\n\"They [Beijing] cannot afford to have people who have no future. It is not just about terrorism. They are really anti-poverty.\"\n\n'I cannot stay silent'\n\nWhatever the government's motivations, Aiziheer Ainiwaer kept silent for months after he heard his father had gone missing. While he was in exile in Belgium he worried about what might happen to his father and other family members who were still living in China.\n\nA China expert said that Beijing sees the re-education policy in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle poverty in the region. [File: How Hwee Young/EPA]\n\n\"It was really difficult for me to not do anything about my father's situation,\" Ainiwaer told Al Jazeera, adding that he only learned about what happened through third party sources, as direct contact with his parents was cut off in early 2018, before his father was detained.\n\nBut has his despair over his father's situation grew, Ainiwaer decided to make public his father's detention, taking his campaign online and on social media, directly challenging official accounts about what was happening in Xinjiang.\n\nThen, last weekend, he received unexpected news. His father had been released after 18 months of what Ainiwaer describes as \"arbitrary imprisonment\".\n\n\"He seemed to be fine, although he looked 10 years older than when he was arrested,\" Ainiwaer said after speaking to his father in a video call. While his mother welcomed the release, she has developed health problems \"due to the stress and sadness\", he added.\n\nAiniwaer believes that speaking out helped in his father's cause, and he urged other Uighurs to do the same to put more pressure on the government of President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"I encourage every other Uighur to stand up for their loved ones. Stay strong and keep fighting until the end. Don't give up.\"\n\nIn July, Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang's Uighur governor, said that \"more than 90 percent\" of those in the \"training centres\" had been released.\n\nThe announcement prompted Uighurs outside China to start a campaign for the Chinese government to substantiate the claim, using the hashtag #provethe90% on social media.\n\nAnother Chinese official also said that Uighurs undergoing \"re-education\" were allowed to \"request time off\" and to \"regularly go home\".\n\nExiled Uighurs in Turkey demand the release of their relatives during a protest in 2018 in Istanbul [File: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP]\n\nAdiljan Abdurihim, secretary of the Norwegian Uyghur Committee, was sceptical about the Chinese claims.\n\n\"We heard similar histories, but we doubt that it is fully true,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It can be a new tactic to silence ongoing testimonies, which we are try to encourage people to submit.\"\n\nAmong the Uighur community in Norway, Abdurihim said they have collected statements from 80 families whose relatives had been detained.\n\n-- Beat 181: Rinat, USA (English) --\n\n\n\nRinat testifies for his aunt and uncle-in-law, Shadiye Zakir (https://t.co/y5GqOiOXtC) and Turahun Jorway (https://t.co/gdPl0GIgpn) - retired Party members having worked at an Ili power plant for 30 years.

That would be the surest way of making sure that they became radicalised. If the local people think that they have been unfairly singled out, their culture was being exterminated, and that they are being forced into one kind of cultural system, there would be resistance.\"\n\nBut he also said that \"only history can tell\" whether the policy towards the Uighurs would be \"beneficial or not.\"\n\nAs for Hemdulla, the Uighur exile in Norway, his decision to leave his homeland and his parents 10 years ago was an extremely difficult one.\n\nHe said that as only child, he bore even more pain with his father's disappearance, but is not giving up hope that his father, Abdurahman, will be released.\n\n\"God willing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Relatives of detained Muslim minorities urge international pressure on Beijing to release people being held in camps.", "authors": ["Ted Regencia"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/30/5c9314fbbbc9424dbf0c484914ac33e8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
