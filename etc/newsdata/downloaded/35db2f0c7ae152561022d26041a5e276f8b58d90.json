The Shield TV Pro ($199.99) and Shield TV ($149.99) are available for purchase immediately \u2014 and some retailers have already been stocking them in recent days.\n\nBoth new Shield TV products include a Tegra X1+ processor, which Nvidia says is \u201cup to 25 percent faster\u201d than the original X1. That\u2019s a pretty minor speed bump when you factor in how old the X1 silicon is getting, but the Shield TV has always been extremely fast and responsive all the same.\n\nThe main upgrades to the 2019 Shields is in software. Dolby Vision HDR is now finally supported. And Nvidia is using artificial intelligence to upscale 1080p and 720p video from your streaming apps so that it comes closer to 4K\u2019s clarity and sharpness.\n\nThe Shield TV Pro\u2019s design looks unchanged from the previous Shield TV, though it no longer ships with an included gamepad. What makes it \u201cPro,\u201d you ask? It\u2019s got more storage (16GB) and RAM (3GB) than the standard Shield TV (8GB/2GB) and is the only one between the two that can be a Plex Media Server. It also has two USB 3.0 ports.\n\nThe standard Shield TV is intended for a more mainstream audience. It\u2019s a long tube with ethernet connectivity and microSD expansion \u2014 no USB ports, though. The look is unconventional, but you\u2019re supposed to hide the Shield TV away somewhere (or even keep it on the floor).\n\nBoth come with a brand new remote that has power, volume, and fast forward/rewind buttons, plus the existing voice search, home, and back controls. There\u2019s also a customizable hardware button and a shortcut for Netflix on there.\n\nThese Shields run the latest version of Android TV, which is still 9/Oreo right now despite 10\u2019s launch on mobile. Google recently added the option to include Android TV in routines that you can set up in the Google Home app, allowing these new devices to be part of chained together flows that are activated with a chosen phrase.", "description": "Amazon and Newegg might\u2019ve spoiled the surprise, but Nvidia is officially launching two new Shield TV devices.
