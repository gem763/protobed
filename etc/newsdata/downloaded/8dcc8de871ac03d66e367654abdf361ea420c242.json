We already have people from all over the world,\u201d Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn proprietor Connie West said Wednesday from her bustling cafe and motel, where volunteers have arrived from Poland, Scotland, Australia, Florida, Idaho and Oklahoma.\n\nNeighbors, elected officials and event organizers said the craze sparked by an internet joke inviting people to \u201csee them aliens\u201d might become a cultural marker, a monumental dud or something in between.\n\nArea 51\u2019s secrecy has long fueled fascination about extraterrestrial life, UFOs and conspiracy theories, giving rise to the events this week and prompting military warnings not to approach the protected site.\n\n\u201cThis phenomenon is really a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity.\n\nThe result, Borer said, was \u201chope and fear\u201d for events that include the \u201cArea 51 Basecamp,\u201d featuring music, speakers and movies, and two festivals competing for the name \u201cAlienstock\u201d starting Thursday.\n\nSome neighbors and officials in two counties near Area 51 are nervous. The area of scenic mountains and rugged desert is home to a combined 50,000 people and compares in size with New England.\n\nElected officials signed emergency declarations after millions of people responded to the Facebook post this summer.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing for the worst,\u201d said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who could see from his home a makeshift stage and cluster of portable toilets in a dusty area recently scraped of brush surrounding West\u2019s little motel and cafe.\n\nArnu said he installed outdoor floodlights, fencing and \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on his 30-acre property. He\u2019s also organized a radio-equipped night watch of neighbors, fearing there won\u2019t be enough water, food, trash bins or toilets for visitors.\n\n\u201cThose that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,\u201d Arnu said. \u201cThose who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nHe predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,\u201d Arnu said. \u201cIt will get cold at night. They\u2019re not going to find what they\u2019re looking for, and they are going to get angry.\u201d\n\nOfficials expect cellular service to be overwhelmed. The nearest gas station is 45 miles (72 kilometers) away. Campers could encounter overnight temperatures as low as 41 degrees (5 degrees Celsius).\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t ask for this,\u201d said Varlin Higbee, a Lincoln County commissioner who voted to allocate $250,000 in scarce funds to handle anticipated crowds.\n\n\u201cWe have planned and staged enough to handle 30,000 to 40,000 people,\u201d Higbee said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many will come for sure.\u201d\n\nThough the creator of the Facebook event later called it a hoax, the overwhelming response sent local, state and military officials scrambling. Promoters began scouting sites. A beer company produced alien-themed cans. A Nevada brothel offered discounts to \u201cE.T. enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby air space this week.\n\n\u201cPeople desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,\u201d said Borer, the sociologist. \u201cArea 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u2019t go. When you tell people they can\u2019t do something, they just want to do it more.\u201d\n\nGeorge Harris, owner of the Alien Research Center souvenir store in Hiko, welcomed the attention and planned a cultural program focused on extraterrestrial lore Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d promises up to 60 food trucks and vendors, trash and electric service, and a robust security and medical staff.\n\nHarris said he was prepared for up to 15,000 people and expected they would appreciate taking selfies with a replica of Area 51\u2019s back gate without having to travel several miles to the real thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe just want people to be safe. As long as they don\u2019t go on the desert floor and destroy the ecosystem, everyone will have a good time.\u201d\n\nWest, the motel owner, is planning an \u201cAlienstock\u201d Thursday through Sunday in Rachel, a town of about 50 residents a more than two-hour drive north of Las Vegas on a normally lonely road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway. She plans 20 musical acts, plus food vendors and souvenir sellers.\n\nWest said she refunded some camping reservations after Matty Roberts, who created the Facebook post, broke ties with her event. Roberts, 20, of Bakersfield, California, is supporting an \u201cAlienstock\u201d festival scheduled for Thursday at an outdoor venue in downtown Las Vegas.\n\nRoberts\u2019 attorneys told West to stop using the \u201cAlienstock\u201d name, but she refused, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll just worry about the legalities later.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to approach the gates of the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.\n\nArea 51 tested aircraft ranging from the U-2 in the 1950s to the B-2 stealth bomber in the 1980s. The government spent decades refusing to acknowledge the site even existed, before releasing documents confirming it in 2013. Its secrecy still fuels speculation that it\u2019s where the government studies aliens.\n\nCounty lawmakers in Nye County, home to a conspicuously green establishment called the Area 51 Alien Center, are discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking precautions and checking the back roads,\u201d Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said.\n\nHer deputies last week arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by \u201cStorm Area 51.\u201d The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and promised to pay thousands in fines.\n\nArnu said the military added razor wire to barbed cattle fencing on the Area 51 boundary near his home, installed more cameras and battery-powered lighting, and erected an imposing spike barrier just inside a gate. He noted a new sign telling trespassers they\u2019ll be arrested and fined $1,000.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement officers and medics will be on hand, along with the Nevada National Guard.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"We have planned and staged enough to handle 30,000 to 40,000 people,\" Lincoln County Commissioner Varlin Higbee said. \"We don't know how many will come for sure.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/storm_area_51_events_62313_c0-123-3102-1931_s1770x1032.jpg?dbaac329f505183240390ef865b3b833c2f70585", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
