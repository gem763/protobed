The GDP data, however, reinforces expectations the Fed will seek to cool expectations for additional rate cuts.\n\nTraders have already scaled back bets for further reductions later this year and in 2020.\n\nRead: 3 things to watch from the Fed meeting\n\nAlso see: Meet the lonely economist who thinks the Fed might just leave interest rates unchanged\n\nFed monetary policy easing is seen as a positive for gold for a variety of reasons, including downward pressure on bond yields, which reduces the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like commodities. Lower interest rates can also put pressure on the U.S. dollar, making gold and other commodities priced in the product less expensive to users of other currencies.\n\n\u201cThe probability of another rate cut this year is seen as being below 30%. Thus the reaction from gold would be correspondingly positive if the Fed raises the rate cut expectations,\u201d said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. \u201cThough this shouldn\u2019t be all that difficult given how low expectations currently are.\u201d\n\nIn other metals trade, January platinum PLF20, -0.16% was off 0.1% at $924.40 an ounce, while December palladium PAZ19, +0.76% rose 0.4% to $1,762 an ounce.\n\nDecember copper HGZ19, -0.11% was off 0.2% at $2.6855 a pound.", "description": "Gold futures cling to a small gain Wednesday after data show third-quarter gross domestic product grew at a faster-than-expected pace, while investors await...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF603_gold_b_ZG_20180316055957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
