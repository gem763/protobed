In time, this display might earn more praise.\n\nBale\u2019s brilliant equaliser means victory in Wales\u2019 remaining games \u2013 away against Azerbaijan and home against Hungary \u2013 should be enough to see them through, providing Slovakia do not shock Croatia.\n\nIt is still a tough ask, but more \u00adencouraging than when Nikola Vlasic gave Croatia a lead within 10 minutes in Cardiff.
