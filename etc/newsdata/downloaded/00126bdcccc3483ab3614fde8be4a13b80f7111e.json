Glenn Hunt\n\n\u201cThe costs of maintaining cattle are incredibly high.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision had been made to exit the venture \u201crather than trying to tolerate another year of drought\u201d.\n\nMr Morison was a director of Blue Sky and oversaw its agribusiness-linked investments, typically regarded as the organisation's solid performers. Blue Sky collapsed earlier this year, after breaching a loan agreement, and Argyle was formed to keep running the agribusiness-linked funds.\n\nThe beef fund\u2019s aim was to create a commercial cattle company to exploit genetics. The fund would take up to 60 per cent of a joint venture with the remainder picked up by genetics and agricultural specialists.\n\nThe venture would \u201charness the value of Wagyu genetics to breed and produce an annual crop of high-quality Wagyu beef from Angus cows\u201d, prospective investors were told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWagyu, originating in Japan and known for its fatty marbling, was in demand in ultra-premium markets across Asia, Blue Sky said.\n\nThe fund began in May 2017 and was among a string of new investments that year, with Blue Sky annual results showing that assets under management had surpassed $3 billion.\n\nThe fund was raising $10.5 million but only 70 per cent was drawn down. The remaining 30 per cent was to be tapped when the business progressed.\n\nThe first 2000 Angus breeders were bought in 2017. But next year, a planned acquisition of another 2000 has been deferred \u201cbecause there was not enough feed in eastern Australia to justify the expansion\u201d, fund investors heard.\n\nCome mid this year, 239 older breeders were sold to a meatworks. But of offspring sold earlier to support cashflows, beef marbling scores resulted in great premiums for the feedlot and processor, an investor update said.\n\nYet by August, the venture partners decided to quit the project and return remaining capital, rather than risk further drought depleting cash reserves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointing outcome,\u201d Mr Morison said.\n\nHe bristled at criticisms raised by short-sellers Glaucus, which made money from share prices falling, that the beef fund was among investments charging \u201cexorbitant\u201d upfront fees to investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was among a string of criticisms, denied by Blue Sky at the time, including that the fund manager had been overstating performance of funds.\n\nThe information memorandum outlined that Blue Sky charged transaction fees of $750,000, including $500,000 on mergers and acquisitions advisory fees and $120,000 for an equity raising fee. The first two years of annual management fees, totalling $400,000, were also tapped at outset.\n\n\u201cYou want to do it for free?\u201d Mr Morison asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fully disclosed.\n\n\u201cThese are not unreasonable expenses.\n\n\u201cIf they [investors] don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t subscribe.\u201d\n\nHe argued Blue Sky had enabled ordinary investors to tap into a venture with highly credentialed sector operators.\n\nThe breeder herd has now been sold and remaining steers and calves, and joint venture, are to be offloaded too. The amount of remaining funds to be returned are yet to be determined but the fund's value has shrivelled from 79\u00a2 a security in December to 63\u00a2.\n\nIf things had gone well, Blue Sky predicted the whole venture could be sold in nine years for $62 million. It had targeted returns exceeding 17 per cent yearly on investor capital.", "description": "The aim was to have a 6000 genetically superior Angus beef for Asia's Wagyu markets.
