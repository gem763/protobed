Demonstrations that spiraled into violent clashes and the shooting of a teenager by a plain clothes police officer under attack.\n\nIn anticipation of more unrest, supermarkets closed their doors early on Saturday as residents rushed to stock up on dried and canned foods, emptying shelves. Early closures by the 7/11 convenience store chain, known to stay open during typhoons, was greeted by widespread surprise.\n\nHong Kong riot police walk past the shuttered underground MTR station in the Sheung Shui Credit: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP More\n\nAt Jason\u2019s, a normally bustling supermarket in downtown Kowloon, customers let out sighs of disappointment as they were denied entry.\n\nViews on the lockdown were mixed. One man named Francis, who had just stocked up on \u201cspam\u201d said he was angry that the protesters had turned into \u201crioters\u201d and said he did not believe the mask ban was an infringement on freedoms.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the shops will be open tomorrow. This is a very sad time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life. We just don\u2019t know what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gigi, 32, who also did not wish to use her full name, said she blamed the government, not the protesters for the inconvenience of shop closures.\n\n\"If I go out tonight, it's not the protesters that I would be afraid of, it's the riot police, if you look at the action they've been taking in the past,\u201d she said. \"I support the protesters, like many people around my age. I feel that these inconveniences aren't an issue.\"\n\nOn social media forums popular with the protesters, the broad consensus appeared to be in favour of a \u201crest day\u201d on Saturday ahead of a renewed, \u201crecord-breaking\u201d demonstration on Sunday.\n\nHowever, small wildcat protests broke out in Kowloon and Causeway Bay as hundreds came out to defy the ban in unsanctioned marches.\n\nIn Kowloon, young people, mainly dressed in black, formed a human chain as they marched for several miles chanting pro-democracy slogans. \u201cWe are fighting against this law because it is contravening our freedoms,\u201d said one young woman.\n\nThe police did not intervene to stop the acts of resistance or to enforce the face mask law, although in Causeway Bay reports emerged of two young people being stopped and questioned but not detained.\n\nAddressing the city in a mid-afternoon broadcast, Carrie Lam used Friday night\u2019s violence to justify her decision to invoke the emergency law for the first time since Hong Kong was ceded to China in 1997.\n\n\u201cThe extreme acts of the rioters brought dark hours to Hong Kong last night and half paralysed society today. Everyone is worried, anxious and even in fear,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe [Hong Kong] Government will curb the violence with the greatest determination. I appeal to everyone to support the [government] to stop the violence in accordance with the law and condemn violence together as well as dissociate from the rioters resolutely.\u201d", "description": "An eery calm hung over Hong Kong on Saturday after businesses and metro stations were torched during a violent Friday night protest against a government ban on pro-democracy protesters wearing face masks.
