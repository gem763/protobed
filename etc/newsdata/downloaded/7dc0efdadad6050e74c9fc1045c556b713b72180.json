Trump wants Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff out over Ukraine investigation", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump once again targeted House Democrats who are conducting a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine whistleblower scandal in tweets accusing them of treason on Sunday, calling for the impeachment of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\n\"This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\" Trump said.\n\nPelosi and Schiff are spearheading the Trump impeachment probe over concerns that he improperly pressured Ukraine's president to investigate political rival Joe Biden. Trump has also suggested that Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, face impeachment.\n\nBut can a member of Congress be impeached? According to law, no, but there are other steps that can be taken.\n\nMore: Donald Trump now accuses Nancy Pelosi of 'treason' (and wants to impeach her)\n\nWhat the law says about impeachment\n\nImpeachment is laid out by the Constitution as the first step in the process to remove an official from office. A president, vice president, or \"civil officer\" can be impeached.\n\nThe House of Representatives holds the authority to vote on and submit articles of impeachment to the Senate, which then has the power to preside over an impeachment trial and ultimately vote on removal from office.\n\nImpeachment is a step that can be taken against an official appointed by the president, including members of the president's cabinet and judges.\n\nMore: How does a Supreme Court justice get impeached?\n\nHouse Democrats are leading the impeachment probe into the president to uncover more details about his dealings with Ukraine, and whether he withheld financial aid to the country in exchange for an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has made the allegation without evidence that the former vice president pressed Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was looking into corruption in a company where his son once sat on the board.\n\nExplainer: What really happened when Biden forced out Ukraine's top prosecutor\n\nCan impeachment be used against members of Congress?\n\nTechnically, members of Congress do not go through impeachment proceedings. But they can be expelled from office and disciplined in other ways.\n\nAccording to a report by the Congressional Research Service, expulsion is a more simplified process than impeachment.\n\n\"A removal through an impeachment requires the action of both houses of Congress\u2014 impeachment in the House and trial and conviction in the Senate; while an expulsion is accomplished merely by the House or Senate acting alone concerning one of its own Members, and without the constitutional requirement of trial and conviction,\" the report states.\n\nHouse and Senate members can expel members with a two-thirds vote, as is laid out in Article I of the Constitution.\n\n....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nA Congressional recall, on the other hand, is not provided for by the Constitution. This consists of constituents voting to place an early limit on the term of their representative through a special election. Some states do provide for recalls for some other state officials, but Supreme Court decisions have opposed the right of states to impose a recall on members of Congress, according to the CRS report.\n\nAnother way to discipline a members of Congress, but that would not result in removal from office, is a censure, which is a formal reprimand of a member that requires a simple majority vote.\n\nA House Republican has also introduced a motion to censure Schiff over his exaggerated reenactment of a phone call between Trump and the Ukraine president.\n\nSo, Trump's call for the impeachment of his critics won't pan out for legal reasons, and it would also be difficult to expel them from office.\n\nI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY \u2014 Donald J.
