Additionally, more than 500 students and alumni had also signed a petition demanding that the university cancel the event.\n\nOn Tuesday, Perry World House released a statement responding to the controversy.\n\n\u201cPerry World House is committed to building an inclusive community on campus and to serving as a home for debate and dialogue on the important, and sometimes controversial, challenges that face the world,\u201d read the statement. \u201cWe are also committed to providing the Penn community access to a broad set of views \u2014 we engage them.\u201d\n\nThe university department also mentioned that it had previously hosted events offering perspectives differing from the views that would be expressed at its upcoming \u201cDetention and Deportation\u201d event.\n\n\u201cSince Perry World House opened our doors three years ago, we have been deeply engaged with the timely and sensitive issue of migration,\u201d continued the statement. \u201cIn the last year alone, Perry World House has hosted events on sanctuary cities, the migrant \u2018caravan\u2019 and international human rights law, media portrayal of refugees, refugee return movements, and more.\u201d\n\nAs with Perry World House\u2019s previous initiatives, our Borders and Boundaries program is hosting an event this week on \u201cDetention and Deportation from Obama to Trump,\u201d which features several speakers, including Thomas Homan, with very different perspectives. The conversation will continue next week when Perry World House hosts a program on \u201cCorruption, Caravans, and Cages: Asylum \u2013 Past, Present, Future.\u201d Members of the Penn community may disagree with a particular speaker at these events, but having conversations about those differences is part of what makes universities such as Penn essential locations for free expression, debate, and dialogue.\n\nPerry World House confirmed that the event would proceed as planned, but when Homan took the stage at around 5:00 p.m. \u2014 alongside former Philadelphia City Solicitor Sozi Tulante and former ICE Public Advocate Andrew Lorenzen-Strait \u2014 the chanting had reportedly gotten louder. Subsequently, the event was canceled fifteen minutes later.\n\nAccording to the Daily Pennsylvanian, the announcement of the event\u2019s cancellation elicited a response of cheering by the student protesters, who were then escorted out of the building.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Students at the University of Pennsylvania never got the chance to hear former director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Thomas Homan speak at an event scheduled at the school on Wednesday because the speaking engagement was canceled in response to student protesters who created a loud disturbance.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/illegal-aliens-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
