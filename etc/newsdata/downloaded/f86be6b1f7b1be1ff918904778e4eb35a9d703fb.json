Photo: Voss Events\n\nStatus can be a funny thing. Of course, it is most obviously expressed through shiny hardware and easily recognizable logos, but it gets far more interesting when you start to observe the more subtle signals \u2014 the way you tuck your shirt, or what you eat for breakfast, or your particular brand of notebook can mark you as in or out. And, of course, what counts as a status item varies wildly across human tribes. In our series \u201cInsider Goods,\u201d we\u2019re talking to members of different tribes (some with their real names, some anonymously) to learn about the niche status items among Broadway actors, ballerinas, or brain surgeons.\n\nToday, we hear from Yvie Oddly \u2014 winner of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season 11 and current performer on the upcoming Werq the World Tour, which comes to New York City on October 19 \u2014 on the tights, setting powder, and snacks that are popular among drag queens.\n\nProTapes Pro 50 Premium Vinyl Dance Floor Tape Lots and lots and lots of tape. I use a bunch of different types of tape for all the different things I do in drag. When I\u2019m tucking myself I use vinyl dance floor tape or boat tape because it\u2019s elastic. When I\u2019m just making an outfit, I either use gap seal tape or packing tape. And I use gap tape to embellish my costumes sometimes. I tape my extra head skin back with my tucking tape as well, and lots of queens tape their heads just to keep their wigs on. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nElmer's Glue Stick Lots and lots and lots of glue. Hot glue\u2019s really good for quick costume fixes or just odd crafting jobs. And superglue is super-essential for so many different things in drag, like keeping your nails on, or jewelry \u2014 even though it\u2019s not recommended to superglue things to your head. I use Elmer\u2019s glue sticks to glue down my eyebrows, and Spirit glue (a costume adhesive) to keep my wigs down, and hair bonding glue to keep my lashes on. All the adhesives, drag is sticky. $3 at Amazon Buy $3 at Amazon Buy\n\nEmergen-C, 60 Count $15 (was $19, now 21% off) I\u2019ve only been a Ru girl for eight months, and so far have spent six of them more away from home than not. I\u2019ve had to learn how to become way more organized and budget my time well, and still fit in time to take a bath or rest if need be. I actually take a whole slew of vitamins every single day, including Emergen-C. I always like to pack some kind of CBD oil to rub on my joints and sore bits \u2014 it helps with the pain. I don\u2019t have a favorite brand, I keep experimenting. I\u2019m still looking, I\u2019m on the search. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nZiploc Gallon Size Freezer Bags $12 (was $19, now 37% off) Now that I\u2019ve started touring quite a bit, I\u2019ve gotten to see what really works for me. I like to buy some of those tiny, collapsible, fabric travel bags that help you organize things, so I can put outfits in there. And gallon-size bags are so helpful to keep everything in order while I\u2019m on the road. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nApple iPhone Ear Pods With Lightning Connector for iPhone 7 / 7 Plus $21 (was $30, now 30% off) I use the standard iPhone headphones. I have different playlists for everything, but my getting ready playlist is mostly rap, because it\u2019s a really cool headspace to get in, it makes you feel confident, and makes you feel like you can do anything, which is a good energy to take into drag. $21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy\n\nCheetos Crunchy Flamin' Hot Cheese Flavored Snacks, Pack of 40 Backstage, we like lots of tiny little finger snacks and candy, because drag queens need to eat too, we\u2019re human beings. But when you\u2019re cinched, padded, tucked, and taped, there\u2019s not necessarily always space for real food. Personally, I like hot Cheetos and Red Bull. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nadidas Adilette Right after you\u2019re done wearing heels you still need to have something on your feet so that you don\u2019t get tetanus at every party. I\u2019ve got a pair of Adidas that have lasted forever, I wore them on Drag Race. And I wore them like years before that too \u2014 they\u2019re my go-to. They\u2019re black and white, but because we weren\u2019t allowed to have logos on the show they have a bunch of green tape splotched over with like, specks of glitter. $45 at Zappos Buy\n\nOnlymaker Women's High Heel Peep Toe Platform Stiletto Pleaser is really the biggest go-to heel brand. However, I\u2019ve started going to this brand called Onlymaker \u2014 they have a lot of really cute shoes for gigantic-footed women. From $32 at Amazon Buy From $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nHuy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 28 oz Sriracha, that\u2019s real. I just need it. I\u2019ve found that a lot of the places I go to have really good food, and it\u2019s super-enjoyable, but Sriracha just makes me feel at home. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nSilver Lilly Monkey Unisex Adult Onesie Pajamas Whether it\u2019s a monkey onesie or my old roommates giant coat \u2014 I need a security blanket that\u2019s big and fluffy. I get cold easily and I\u2019m also tired a lot, so I take impromptu mini naps whenever I\u2019m not super-busy. It\u2019s just nice to have something that I can use as a pillow or as a blanket. When I see a cute onesie anywhere in public I\u2019ll grab one, but all of the ones I have right now are Amazon buys. I know I\u2019m not the only queen who\u2019s done it, I\u2019ve seen Bob [the Drag Queen] in onesies, I believe. I just know I\u2019m for sure reppin\u2019 the onesie game strong, especially in the winter. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nFebreze AIR Effects Air Freshener Meadows & Rain, Pack of 6 As much beauty goes into drag, a bunch of ugly comes the fuck out of it. When you\u2019re up on stage, under these hot lights, in seven pairs of pantyhose and like, couch cushions strapped to your body, you\u2019re just sweating, and if you dance you\u2019re completely soaked. Often during traveling, you don\u2019t really have time to let your stuff air out, so you\u2019ll pack it up when it\u2019s still wet. And if you don\u2019t have a washer-dryer quick and handy, you still have to smell like a lady. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nCapezio Women's Studio Basics Tight, Light Suntan $11 (was $12, now 8% off) You need to get good dancer tights, because they\u2019re meant to last longer. I always get Capezio or Bloch. I buy mine in suntan, because my color doesn\u2019t shift a whole lot throughout the year. From $11 at Amazon Buy From $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nAirtex High Density Foam There are some queens who you can pay to make padding for you \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve had to do now because of lack of time \u2014 instead of actually sitting down and carving them out. However, something that anyone can do is get a little block of foam either from an old couch or from Hobby Lobby or Jo-Ann\u2019s. $20 at Joann Buy\n\nFenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation I use Fenty and Ben Nye for my foundation. I use Ben Nye to cover the parts of me that are super-manly, like my mustache and my jaw. And then for the parts of me that don\u2019t require such heavy makeup, I use Fenty. It\u2019s a half-and-half blend. $34 at Sephora Buy\n\nBen Nye Neutral Set Setting Powder To set everything, I do half with Ben Nye\u2019s bare setting powder and half with Coty Airspun powder. I started using Ben Nye because I used to paint like a theater clown, but a lot of the beauty queens I work with who look soft and Photoshopped turned me on to the Coty Airspun. $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nViva Naturals Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil For makeup remover, ideally I try and use oils, like coconut oil, but if I\u2019m in a pinch I always just use a makeup wipe. I don\u2019t like any of them, they all sting my skin. I haven\u2019t found one that really works for me, which is why I use an oil base first, then a wipe to clean the oil off. $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nAbsolutely Lush Lighted Makeup Mirror $23 (was $30, now 23% off) On tour, it\u2019s recommended to bring your own makeup mirror, especially if you\u2019re a makeup perfectionist, because there\u2019s always some crazy lighting situation. I brought one of the cheaper ones on Amazon, but I haven\u2019t used it for the past six months. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nJeffree Star Cosmetics Velour Liquid Lip, Drug Lord For lips, I usually go for Jeffree Star. I use one as a lip liner and then I use a different one as a lipstick. I use every color of the rainbow \u2014 that\u2019s also why I love Jeffree, he\u2019s got brilliant colors. But the white one is the best. I\u2019ll also use that as my eye makeup, we\u2019ll use it as a base. $18 at Morphe Buy\n\nWig Takeout Mandarin Calpernia With wigs, I know the brands that are popular for everyone, but I really don\u2019t have any obsession. I know right now 1-800 Wig Takeout is hot, there\u2019s Serving Lace out of Colorado, and there\u2019s Wigs and Grace. I just like to go down to the local hair store and see what the craziest colors or cuts of wigs they have. On tour, I don\u2019t like to wear a lot of heavy hair because I\u2019m a really theatrical, physical queen, and don\u2019t want it ruining my makeup. And I don\u2019t need to be any hotter. $95 at Wig Takeout Buy\n\nGot2b Glued Blasting Freeze Spray, Pack of 2 To style my wigs, I only use scissors, and maybe a little bit of Got2Be. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
