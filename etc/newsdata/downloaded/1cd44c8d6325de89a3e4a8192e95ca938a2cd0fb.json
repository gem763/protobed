Maxine Waters, California Democrat and the committee\u2019s chairwoman.\n\n\u201cPolitical speech is some of the most scrutinized speech already in the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg added.\n\nFacebook said last month that political ads are not subjected to the same fact-checking standards as other content paid to run on its platforms, raising concerns about candidates and campaigns potentially exploiting the policy to peddle misinformation.\n\nTaking aim at the policy near the start of the hearing, Ms. Waters said Facebook has effectively given politicians a \u201cplatform to lie, mislead and misinform the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn principle, I believe in giving people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg responded. \u201cI believe that ads can be an important part of voice. I think that, especially in the political process for challenger candidates and for local candidates and advocacy groups whose message might not otherwise be covered by the media, having ads can be an important way to inject your message into the political debate.\u201d\n\nFacebook previously acknowledged that Russian internet trolls used its platform to spread politically-charged posts and disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the company\u2019s critics have subsequently warned about similar tactics being used to muddy the 2020 race.\n\nIndeed, Facebook has recently received and rejected requests from Democrats to stop running a controversial ad purchased by President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee. Both the Democratic National Committee and the White House campaign for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a front-runner in the race for the party\u2019s nomination, have characterized the ad as misleading and unsuccessfully pressed Facebook to refuse it.\n\nRep. Andy Barr, Kentucky Republican, applauded Mr. Zuckerberg for Facebook refusing to balk and asked him to ensure that no ads for Mr. Trump are refused.\n\n\u201cI do find it highly troubling that politicians are trying to bully you to be a fact-checker and to be the speech police, especially in politics, at the core of the First Amendment,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cWill you commit that Facebook will not censor any political ad placed on your platform or in support of President Donald Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg responded. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t just go for Trump. That goes for any of the candidates for any of our national offices. People need to be able to see for themselves and be able to make judgments on what the candidates are saying and their character.\u201d\n\nMore than 2 billion people use Facebook\u2019s products on a daily basis, according to the company.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
