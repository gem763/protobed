I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d said Bianca Ferrari as she staggered out of Spillers Records in Cardiff after meeting a band she has loved all her life. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming to this record shop since I was seven and I adore it but that was just something else. Surreal \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m on another planet.\u201d\n\nThe sight of the alt-rock legends Pixies insouciantly strolling along a Victorian arcade in the Welsh capital and perching behind the counter at Spillers, which claims to be the oldest record shop in the world, to meet fans was an other-worldly one.\n\nIt was appropriate that the US band fastened on Friday the 13th for the launch of their seventh album, Beneath the Eyrie, with its tales of witchcraft, lost souls and graveyards.\n\nPixies: Beneath the Eyrie review \u2013 gothy, theatrical alt-rock fables and tall tales Read more\n\nBut the venue for the launch was surprising. Darren Floyd, another Spillers regular, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it when we found out they were coming here.\u201d\n\nThe appearance of Pixies at Spillers could be seen as rock music\u2019s recognition of a great Welsh institution, which is celebrating its 125th year.\n\nIn 2010 there was an outcry when the smartening up of Cardiff city centre sent rents soaring and threatened the existence of Spillers and other independent retailers.\n\nBob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen were among the global stars who signed a petition calling for it to be saved. The shop moved from the main drag into Morgan Arcade and continued to trade.\n\nThose waiting in the queue to meet Pixies said it was the personal touch that made Spillers special. Justin Shaer said he visited every Friday \u2013 record release day \u2013 and there was often a pile of records waiting for him. He said: \u201cThey know what I like. I don\u2019t have to ask for it. The records are there waiting for me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fans queue outside Spillers Records in Cardiff.

But their decision to sign LPs and posters for 100 fans on the day their new record was released seemed charmingly uncommercial.\n\nAshli Todd, the owner of Spillers, said: \u201cThey\u2019re lovely, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Meanwhile the band\u2019s frontman, Charles Thompson IV, AKA Black Francis, bobbed his head to the song On Graveyard Hill from the new album. His eyes were hidden by shades but he and the other band members seemed cheerful enough as they signed and chatted away.\n\nTodd said: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day we have living legends like this in our shop. I\u2019ve worked here for 23 years. This was the most nervous day for me. I\u2019m bowled over they chose an independent shop.\u201d\n\nThe majority of pre-orders for the album in Spillers were for the vinyl edition. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely a vinyl kind of band,\u201d said Todd. A limited edition in white vinyl was going down particularly well. The resurgence of interest in vinyl is helping Spillers.\n\nLast year, more than 4m chart-eligible LPs were sold in the UK alone compared with 3.2m records sold in 2016. This is expected to rise to about 4.5m in 2019.\n\nEarlier this month Rolling Stone reported that the revenue generated by record sales was likely to surpass that of CDs \u2013 though it also points out that streaming is by far the most popular way of listening to music.\n\nIt\u2019s still a struggle for shops like Spillers. Todd said: \u201cThe economy has been going through a bumpy time. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the UK \u2013 you can\u2019t turn on the radio without hearing about more dramatic downturns on the high street, which makes events like this one so important.\u201d\n\nThe signings done, the band ambled off. Pixies lead guitarist, Joey Santiago, a record shop enthusiast, paused to admire the scale (modest) of the store. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and personal,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve got a soft spot for this sort of mom-and-pop store. It\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joey Santiago (left) and Black Francis on stage at the Daydream festival, California, August 2019.

Before they made it big, Manic Street Preachers used to travel down from the valleys to busk in front of the shop.\n\nThe like of Cerys Matthews, of Catatonia and BBC 6 Music, and the Welsh indie darlings Super Furry Animals used to browse the racks in search of inspiration.\n\nIn 2010 when Spillers\u2019 future was threatened by soaring rents, more than 20,000 people \u2013 including Justin Timberlake and Beyonce \u2013 signed a petition to save it.\n\nThankfully for record fans everywhere the shop carried on \u2013 albeit in a new location \u2013 and partly thanks to the revived interest in vinyl collecting.\n\nSpillers has a rich tradition dating back to 1894 when Henry Spiller opened in the Queen\u2019s Arcade specialising in the sale of phonographs, wax phonograph cylinders and shellac phonograph discs.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Henry\u2019s son, Edward, took over and, with the aid of accordionist and band leader Joe Gregory, sold musical instruments alongside prerecorded music. In the late 1940s Henry moved the shop round the corner to a larger premises on the Hayes, where it remained until those rising rents put its very existence in doubt.\n\nIt closed for a month and reopened with a gig headlined by Gruff Rhys, of the Super Furry Animals (the band\u2019s Welsh-language album Mwng remains a perennial top seller).\n\nKnowledge and the personal touch are the keys to the shop\u2019s survival in the face of fierce competition from downloads and streaming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Spillers sign.

In these troubled times when the high street is struggling Spillers has become a rare success story.", "description": "Fans\u2019 delight as US group launch new album Beneath the Eyrie at Spillers Records", "authors": ["Steven Morris", "Rupert Morrison", "Barbara Ellen", "Nigel Kendall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72992f9a4d4fdfaf107f120fb277f269bd79025/0_0_5926_3556/master/5926.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c33e57c0b22f147d39da986a58cdc8e", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
