We experienced it a few years ago at Hull, and it is mightily difficult to get that mindset of playing Thursday because always (you have) to play on a Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe big teams who are used to playing repeatedly in Europe, they become accustomed to it, but it can be difficult.\n\n\u201cI hope we can benefit from it. Let\u2019s hope they are really tired and bruised and battered and the plane was delayed five hours!\n\nNewcastle head coach Steve Bruce is hoping Wolves\u00b4 European adventure has taken a toll (Nigel French/PA)\n\n\u201cBut look, they\u2019re a very, very good side, so if they are are a bit fatigued, then hopefully we can take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nWolves will arrive on Tyneside boasting a seven-game unbeaten run having initially enduring a difficult start to the Premier League campaign as they attempted to manage the dual demands of domestic and European football.\n\nBruce is expecting another stern test of his team\u2019s credentials.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey\u2019ve played a strong side since they\u2019ve gone into Europe. I think they\u2019ve made it a priority and you can only be quietly impressed with what they\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cThey romped the Championship a couple of years ago and what did they finish \u2013 seventh \u2013 in the Premier League last year? It\u2019s a wonderful return, and the one thing they have got is good players.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got good players and play in a certain system a bit similar to ours, bit do it very, very well, so they\u2019re a threat. They\u2019re a good, good side.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve already played 17, 18 games this year and only lost a few of those, so they are a good side.\u201d\n\nNewcastle will be without injured duo Fabian Schar and Andy Carroll, while Isaac Hayden completes a three-match ban.", "description": "Wanderers won in Bratislava on Thursday evening.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/09/wire-20211126-1572079511-782_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
