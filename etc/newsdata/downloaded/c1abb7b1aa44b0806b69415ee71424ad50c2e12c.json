There was later another stoppage moments before half-time, but the referees and players decided to play on for the rest of the half in spite of the ugly chanting.\n\nThe stadium announcer said: 'Because of racist behaviour which is interfering with the game the referee has indicated that he will suspend the match. Please be in no doubt that the game will be suspended and even abandoned. Let everyone enjoy the game. Say no to racism.'\n\nA UEFA official has revealed that a meeting was held with England players during half time and it was decided that if the racial abuse continued, the players would come off.\n\nFans do a Nazi salute despite repeated warnings about the match being stopped if that racist behaviour continued\n\nA fan holds up a No Respect jumper, rubbishing UEFA's Respect campaign for equality and an end to racism in football\n\nEngland's Raheem Sterling was a target for much of the abuse with reporters inside the stadium hearing monkey noises and jeers directed at him\n\nPlayers and manager Gareth Southgate gather around the match referees to alert them about the horrific abuse the black players were being subjected to\n\nUEFA'S THREE-STEP PROTOCOL 1 - The referee will speak to the stadium announcer and demand the halting of racist behaviour. 2 - If it continues, the referee can take the players off the field into the dressing rooms for a period of time and the stadium announcer will make another address. 3 - If it still continues, the match will be abandoned.\n\nThe abuse was directed towards Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and debutant Tyrone Mings, with jeers and monkey noises heard when they touched the ball.\n\nBut the players let their football do the talking with Sterling scoring twice, Rashford netting once and Mings helping keeping a clean sheet as England went on a six-goal rout.\n\nSouthgate said after the match: 'We have managed to make two statements by winning the game and also raising the situation to everybody.'\n\nHe told 5 Live: 'My entire focus had to be on protecting my players and staff and I think we have done that. They have been an absolute credit. I am very proud.'\n\nAlong with their chanting, Bulgaria fans were also seen making Nazi salutes and offensive gestures in the crowd.\n\nDuring the halts in play, the 3,400 England fans chanted at their Bulgarian counterparts: 'You know what you are, you know what you are. You racist b******s You know what you are.'\n\nFans in black wore clothes which had 'ultras' and 'hooligans' printed on them, before a mass walk-out before half-time\n\nRaheem Sterling, who has previously spoken out about racism in football, scored two of England's six goals in the comprehensive win, silencing the racist fans\n\nHordes of Bulgarian fans in black hoodies and shirts which said 'hooligans from Sofia' left the stadium after warnings over their behaviour\n\nGareth Southgate and his players spoke to the referee about the offensive chants they heard from the stands\n\nRaheem Sterling, who scored twice tonight, posted an Ainsley Harriott meme as he agreed with Piers Morgan that there is 'no sweeter way' to show up the Bulgarians than having a black England player 'destroy their team with his sublime talent'.

Big test for UEFA. Will be watching to see what action they take. Well done #England and #englandfans.'\n\nTyrone Mings, making his England debut, first raised concerns about the racism, with Gareth Southgate then made aware leading to step one of UEFA's protocol.\n\nMings said after the game: 'It was quite clear to hear on the pitch but I think we showed a great response and showed a great togetherness and hopefully let football do the talking.'\n\nA number of stickers appearing to condone racism were apparent outside the stadium including one which had 'Nazi Zone' emblazoned across it.\n\nIan Wright said on ITV: 'The fact is there are a set of people there who have got no respect, they have no respect. UEFA are not doing nearly enough. I am so proud at what we are doing at the moment.'\n\nRoy Keane added: 'You feel sick to your stomach when you witness it. It is horrible. I feel physically sick listening to that.'\n\nWright added: 'You can feel physically sick, but you have to continue playing through that and what we are seeing now is you don't have to do that.\n\n'It is a terrible day for Bulgarian people but it is a great day for tackling racism.\n\n'What we are seeing is a set of fans who do not care and need educating.\n\nTyrone Mings (centre) making his debut for England, was the first player to report the abuse which led to the first stoppage\n\nBulgarian fans with hoods and face masks, some of them with 'hooligans' printed on their shirts, head for the exits after the second stoppage\n\nEngland fans responded to the racism with loud cheers for their players and a rousing rendition of the national anthem\n\nEngland captain Harry Kane spoke to referee Ivan Bobek as game was stopped the first time\n\nThe game was stopped for a second time as Gareth Southgate reported more abuse from the stands\n\nEngland and Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard tweeted an image of a black and white Three Lions crest, calling it a 'shameful' night\n\nTyrone Mings thanked the England fans for their support at the end of the match after being on the end of the horrific abuse\n\n'We have heard it for many years about walking off and it is something you do not want to do.

This is despite monkey noises aimed at England forward Raheem Sterling being clearly heard at the ground and on television. Balakov told ITV: 'I personally did not hear the chanting you are most probably referring to. I saw that the referee stopped the game. 'But I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on behalf of the Bulgaria fans but also the England fans who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgaria national anthem and during the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.'\n\nThe game was stopped again but the players did not leave the pitch as a further announcement was made. It was later revealed that the players and referee decided to play on until half-time, then leave the field if they heard anything in the second half.\n\nIt is the first time that UEFA's protocols on tackling racist abuse have been implemented for an England game.\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke revealed that England players and backroom staff are providing witness statements so that UEFA and Bulgarian police can conduct a full investigation into the racist incidents at the match.\n\nMr Clarke blamed a group of around 50 Bulgarian fans, who were all dressed in black and gathered together in section of the home end.\n\nHe said: 'It was difficult to pick out individuals, but they were all doing it. It was terrible racism.\n\n'The players reported it to the referee, and they spoke with him and the manager. I told Gareth at half time that whatever he wanted to do, he had my full support. He's now with the team and wants to spend some time with them to make sure that they are OK.\n\n'He's concerned about their welfare and the impact that this could have on them. I'd like to say it is shocking but it is not.'\n\nMr Clarke added that he had spoken with the players affected and also some of England's backroom staff.\n\n'Some of the backroom staff in particular were visibly emotionally upset. It's not just about the players because we also have a very multi-racial backroom team.\n\n'UEFA now need to take time to collect all the evidence, look at the statements that we will be providing to examine the facts and take the appropriate action.'\n\nA hooded Bulgaria fan watches on before a large group walked out en masse after the second stoppage in play in the first half\n\nBefore the match Gareth Southgate said he had spoken to his players about how they would react to any potential racist abuse\n\nGary Lineker praised Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for pleading with the fans at half-time to stop with their abuse\n\nEngland's forward Harry Kane speaks with the referees during a temporary interruption in the first half of the qualifier\n\nBulgaria have previously been sanctioned by UEFA and they were ordered to leave 5,000 seats empty tonight as a punishment for previous abuse against Kosovo\n\nAt the end of the match after England's comfortable 6-0 win, manager Gareth Southgate headed to the England fans and applauded them\n\nBefore the match Gareth Southgate said he had spoken to his players about how they would react to any potential racist abuse and said he was prepared to walk his team off the pitch.\n\nBut Borislav Mihaylov, the President of the Bulgarian FA also wrote a letter of complaint to UEFA accusing England of 'offensive, unjust' and 'derogatory' comments about Bulgarian fans.\n\nThis is in spite of the fact they have previously been sanctioned by UEFA who ordered that 5,000 seats be left empty tonight as a punishment for previous abuse against Kosovo.
