Taylor, 28, is the taller, longer man, but this is a genuine 50/50 contest between two unbeaten world champions approaching the prime of their careers, both boxers having mastered every challenge presented them thus far in their careers.\n\nPrograis, 30, arguably, has the greater equalising power, yet Taylor has shown a pair of whiskers and an ability to counter attack with spite against every opponent.\n\nThere are huge spoils for the victor, notably the No 1 position in the 140lb division, the Ring Magazine belt, and moreover, the Muhammad Ali Trophy, as the winner of the World Boxing Super Series, which pulled the eight fighters together for this tournament.\n\nThat has been one of the mouth-watering prospects as the tournament played out, with both men expected to face each other in this final. Prograis - record 24-0 with twenty knockouts - from New Orleans, complete with his harrowing tale of escaping Hurricane Katrina as a teenager and Taylor - with an unblemished 15-0 career with twelve knockouts - have been in confrontational mode throughout the build-up before their clash at The O2 in London.", "description": "Josh Taylor claimed to be \"sick of the sight\" of opponent Regis Prograis as the Scotsman steps up for the test of his career and the opportunity to rubber-stamp his standing as the bona fide No 1 fighter in the light-welterweight division on Saturday night in a potentially thrilling contest against his equally strident opponent from the USA.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214106799-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
