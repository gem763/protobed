All 1953 examples were two-seat roadsters that had white exteriors with red interiors. Their fibreglass-reinforced plastic bodies set a precedent that GM would carry on through generations of Corvettes.\n\nThe introduction of the convertible edition comes relatively quickly after the July debut of the coupe. (It can take a year for car makers to pull the trigger on the \"spyder\" versions of their cars.) But considering the 66-year history of GM's most-collected model, it's an apt decision; when that first Corvette roadster debuted in 1953, it didn't even come in an optional coupe form. A fixed-roof coupe version didn't come until a decade later, when GM added it to the second generation of its wildly popular chrome-grilled, single-headlight cars.\n\nThe 2020 Corvette, with the first mid-engine placement of the line, is a huge risk.\n\nA necessary risk\n\nThe 2020 Corvette, with the first mid-engine placement of the line, is a huge risk for a company that has seen sales decline and has suffered recent labour disputes, because it plays such an important role. The Vette accounts for just 4.7 per cent of GM's total volume of cars sold, but it represents 11 per cent of GM's car retail revenue year-to-date, according to Kevin Tynan, lead automotive analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nCorvette has the highest retail revenue per unit for car nameplates at GM. With an average transaction price of $US76,057 ($112,270) in 2019, the Corvette is by far the most expensive car GM sells, second only to the Escalade SUV in the entire GM portfolio. The convertible starts production by the end of the first quarter of 2020, just three months after production begins of the coupe; it will certainly help augment early sales of the car.\n\nBut Corvette buyers are a notoriously ageing demographic, apt to be even more discouraged by the fact that the new model - in a bid to emulate its European counterparts, attract younger drivers, and conserve production costs - does not offer a manual transmission. Corvette sales in the US have declined in every quarter since 2016. In 2018, dealers sold just 18,791 of them, down 44 per cent from 2015. At peak sales in 2006, Corvette sold 37,000 total units in the US. The brand hasn't come near that number since.\n\nChristopher Bonelli, a spokesman for General Motors, says he expects the convertible's sales to account for more new Corvette sales in 2020 than it does currently - hopefully goosing the car's bottom line. He declined to specify an exact percentage, but in recent years, convertibles have made up fewer than 20 per cent of total Corvette sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollectors prefer the convertible\n\nA bigger question for those relative few who are still excited enough about Corvette to spend the roughly $US60,000 required to get one is how the open-top version will hold its value, long-term.\n\nAt the dealership, current models such as the Stingray, for example, come with deep discounts - never a good indicator for the strength of demand. The appetite for hot rods in general has shrunk to 2.3 per cent of the nation's total vehicle market, about half what it was a decade ago, according to Edmunds.\n\nThese are not nice realities for Chevrolet to face. But they won't matter to the true Vette enthusiast, who might liken driving this excellent car to celebrating Independence Day every time they get behind the wheel. It's difficult to overstate the amount of devotion the Corvette engenders, a feeling that, for many of its owners, mixes patriotic pride with personal freedom. And if you're asking, you're probably better served buying the convertible version. (That is, unless you can find a Stingray coupe that has never been driven.)\n\nCorvette \"convertibles have been worth, on average, 13 per cent more than their coupe versions\".\n\n\"Convertible Corvettes are typically worth more than their coupe counterparts,\" says Jonathan Klinger, a spokesman for Hagerty Insurance. \"Except for the 1963 split-window coupe, which has, on average, been worth 21 per cent more [than the convertible counterpart], convertibles have been worth, on average, 13 per cent more than their coupe versions.\"\n\nCorvette values at auction and in private sales vary widely, depending on the generation and model year. Generally, though, a convertible is a significantly better bet: For model years 1968-1975, the convertible premium has averaged 28 per cent over coupes; from convertibles from 1986-1996, the convertible premium is, on average, 29 per cent, according to Hagerty.\n\nAnd unless you choose that famed split-window coupe from 1963, which can cost from $US56,000 for entry-level versions in good condition to $US386,000 for the Z06 \"big tank\" version, according to Hagerty, you won't have to pay much for a good Vette at all. The values of the absolute best fifth-generation Vette in the world - the ones made from 1997 to 2004, for instance - don't surpass $US30,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose from more recent years have brought near bargain-basement levels, though the open-top options will bring in a little more dough: A base-level 2000 Corvette V8 is worth an average of $US16,300, according to Hagerty. (The car cost $US3498 when it first went on sale in 1953.) The convertible version of the same car is worth $US17,600, on average. And for the sixth-generation cars, those made from 2005 to 2013, the convertibles have averaged considerably higher values - 25 per cent better than the coupes.\n\nSerious collectors will tend to amass convertible examples of earlier models, Klinger says, since they have been more tested on the collecting market over time. But the most important thing for interested parties is to buy what they genuinely like. A car just gathering dust in a garage isn't fun for anybody.\n\nPricing on the entry-level 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Coupe starts at $US59,995. The starting price on the entry-level convertible is $US67,495. If you keep it long enough, odds are you'll more than recoup the difference.\n\nThis article is from Bloomberg.
