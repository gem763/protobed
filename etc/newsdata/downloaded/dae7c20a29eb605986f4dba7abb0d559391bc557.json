REUTERS/Feline Lim\n\nArdern apologised to the 19-year-old complainant last week and took control of the investigation, as the matter became a major embarrassment for the centre-left coalition government, led by Ardern\u2019s Labour Party, ahead of a general election next year.\n\nArdern told a news conference a party lawyer would finish a report on the Labour response to complaints, and it would then be handed to an independent third-party reviewer who would \u201cestablish a statement of facts on the party process and what complaints were received\u201d.\n\n\u201cMistakes have been made ... it\u2019s now my job to address it,\u201d Ardern told the news conference after a cabinet meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty of care and we failed in it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe woman who complained alleged that last year a party staffer assaulted her in a private residence, and she reported this to the Labour Party, including then party president Nigel Haworth.\n\nThe party investigated the matter and concluded that no further action was needed against the party staffer.\n\nBut Ardern ordered a review of the matter last month after other complaints came about the staffer, and media reports emerged giving details of the 19-year-old\u2019s account and the nature of the assault.\n\nArdern accepted Haworth\u2019s resignation and the man accused of the assault, who has not been identified, has also resigned.\n\nHaworth argued that the complainants never informed him about the seriousness of the assault. The man facing the accusations has denied them, media has reported.\n\nArdern has said she was never made aware that the complaints were sexual in nature. But critics say she acted late and tried to protect colleagues who mishandled the complaints.\n\nArdern said she was willing to meet the complainants but it would be best if the matter was kept out of the public domain.\n\nArdern has seen her ratings drop in recent months due to the coalition\u2019s handling of the economy and other issues.", "description": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday an independent reviewer will look into her party's handling of sexual assault complaints against a party staffer, amid mounting pressure and questions about her leadership on the matter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430380673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0IG", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
