Yet his productions typically went beyond country\u2019s standard sound to embrace aspects of pop and soul music.\n\nOn Urban\u2019s \u201cRipcord\u201d album, from 2016, he brought a slick disco groove to \u201cThe Fighter,\u201d a duet with Carrie Underwood, and helped arrange unlikely cameos by Pitbull and Chic\u2019s Nile Rodgers in \u201cSun Don\u2019t Let Me Down.\u201d Lady Antebellum\u2019s \u201cYou Look Good,\u201d which he co-wrote and produced, had taut horns and snappy funk drums.\n\nHis range was perhaps best captured on Morris\u2019s 2016 major-label debut, \u201cHero,\u201d which set the singer\u2019s low, bluesy voice against sparkling synth lines and throbbing hip-hop beats.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want my record to lull people into a comfortable vibe they\u2019d heard a million times,\u201d Morris told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. \u201cBusbee was never afraid to take it there and get weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cHero\u201d was nominated for best country album at the Grammys, while Morris\u2019s single \u201cMy Church,\u201d which Busbee co-wrote, was nominated for best country song; the two rejoined for Morris\u2019s follow-up record, this year\u2019s equally eclectic \u201cGirl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a purist,\u201d the producer said of his style. \u201cWhatever the song needs is what it needs. And if it feels right? It is.\u201d\n\nBusbee was born Michael James Ryan in Walnut Creek, Calif., on June 18, 1976. He played classical piano as a child; later, he studied jazz trombone at New Jersey\u2019s William Paterson University before returning home and working as a music pastor at a church.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and got a job assisting Eric Valentine, an in-demand rock producer; Busbee went on to establish himself as a songwriter with tunes for the Backstreet Boys and Toni Braxton, as well as for a number of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d contestants.\n\nHis professional path in Nashville was cleared by the veteran producer and songwriter Dann Huff, who signed Busbee to an early publishing deal around 2007. One of his first country hits was \u201cSummer Nights\u201d by Rascal Flatts, which Huff produced.\n\nDespite his success in country\u2019s capital, Busbee continued to live in L.A., where he often worked in a cozy, gear-stuffed studio in Glassell Park. His survivors include his wife and their three daughters.", "description": "With Morris, he worked on \u201cHero,\u201d \u201cMy Church\u201d and \u201cGirl.\u201d", "authors": ["Mikael Wood", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Taz7r1KFMBZkTFc6QdHfkhTrEVE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UQ5S3WXDVAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
