The smartphones feature a variety of improvements, including three all-new cameras on the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.\n\nBut one element missing from the announcement was something carriers and governments around the world have been talking about for years: 5G. Fifth-generation cellular technology, or 5G, is a far faster version of wireless data connectivity than the 4G LTE we currently have. We\u2019re talking websites loading in the blink of an eye, and movies and music downloading faster than ever before.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone will likely get that next year, which some analysts believe could hurt sales of the newly-unveiled iPhone 11 lineup.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect iPhone revenue to decline 1% y/y in FY20 as a result of few compelling updates to this year\u2019s devices and increasing awareness related to 5G that may result in consumers waiting to buy a new device,\u201d Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson wrote in his research note following Apple\u2019s event.\n\nThe iPhone 11 might not include 5G connectivity, but it's likely still worth the upgrade for many users.

So you won\u2019t be able to take advantage of those super-fast speeds. Instead you\u2019ll likely end up using current 4G LTE networks. And it\u2019s still unclear when 5G connections will be as ubiquitous as 4G LTE. Which means even without the high-speed connectivity of 5G, Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 line might still be worth the upgrade for many users.\n\nThe future is 5G\n\nRemember when 4G LTE technology was still rolling out in 2010? The world was still largely dependent on 3G, with web speeds that bordered on frustrating at best. 4G LTE, though, ushered in a new age of connectivity, drastically changing how we do everything from ordering food, getting a cab, and paying for goods. It sent shockwaves through the global economy that are still reverberating today.\n\nPeople try out the new iPhone 11 Pro during Apple's event on Tuesday, Sept. 10. (Image: Apple) More\n\n5G is expected to do that and more. We\u2019re talking about near-instantaneous connectivity. The fear for Apple, according to Olson, is that as more users become aware of 5G, they\u2019ll hold off on buying this year, and instead purchase what is expected to be next year\u2019s 5G iPhone. That could be especially troubling for Apple in China, where homegrown competitors like Huawei are already launching 5G-capable devices.\n\nThat all, however, assumes consumers understand what 5G has to offer.\n\n\u201cConsumers tend to have vague ideas about how tech benefits them,\u201d explained Gartner Research\u2019s Tuong Nguyen.\n\n\u201cFor 5G, I assume it\u2019s in the realm of \u2018more, better, faster\u2019 without knowing specific details or applications. While everyone wants more, better, faster, I think the most important point question is, are consumers willing to pay for whatever they will be getting, and how much?\u201d\n\nAccording to a Piper Jaffray survey the vast majority of 1,050 current iPhone owners, 77%, say they would pay a premium for a 5G-capable iPhone.\n\nApple likely had its reasons for leaving out 5G\n\nWhen Apple rolled out its first 3G and 4G iPhones, it was months, if not years, behind the launch of 3G and 4G phones by the company\u2019s competitors, explained Nguyen.\n\n\u201cWhen you look across their device portfolio, they\u2019re selling an experience, rather than the newest technology or feature. In other words, it\u2019s about how you use the tech, not the tech per se,\u201d Nguyen said.", "description": "Apple's iPhone 11 lineup doesn't include 5G connectivity, but that might not matter.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qdZyn5frWeMcl18_ifs0pA--~B/aD0zMjI0O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/56a3bca0-d597-11e9-acee-1855fb64c08b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
