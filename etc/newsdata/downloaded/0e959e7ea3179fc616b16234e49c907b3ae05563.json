Mark Sanford, a potential primary challenger to President Trump, said the U.S. is headed for an economic collapse on a greater scale than the 2008 downturn if things aren\u2019t corrected quickly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed for worse than [a recession], because the average recession out there is driven by inventory imbalances,\u201d Mr. Sanford told Iowa Public Television this week. \u201cThe really scary stuff goes to a balance sheet imbalance, and fundamentally that\u2019s what we have.\u201d\n\nHe said the Federal Reserve has exhausted its potential remedies if things take a turn for the worse.\n\n\u201cAnd on the financial side with the federal government, look at those trillion-plus dollar deficits [anticipated] over the next 10 years,\u201d Mr. Sanford said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of leeway there, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the most significant financial storm that we have seen, I would argue, since the Great Depression,\u201d Mr. Sanford said. \u201cI would argue that it [would] be greater than what we saw in 2008. It\u2019s going to diminish and destroy people\u2019s dreams and their hopes going forward if we don\u2019t get ahead of this curve.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the history \u2026 is if you don\u2019t proactively deal with these kinds of numbers and simply wait for the financial markets to do it for you, the process is bloody,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Mr. Sanford jumps in, he would join other long-shot GOP challengers to Mr. Trump, including former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois.\n\nMr. Trump has dismissed the trio as the \u201cThree Stooges\u201d and alluded to Mr. Sanford\u2019s extramarital affair when he was governor of South Carolina earlier this week.\n\n\u201cOne is \u2018Mr. Appalachian Trail\u2019 who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons\u2026Another is a one-time BAD Congressman from Illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide, then failed in radio. The third is a man who couldn\u2019t stand up straight while receiving an award. I should be able to take them!\u201d the president tweeted this week.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what incident Mr. Trump was referring to with respect to Mr. Weld, though the former governor\u2019s campaign pointed to this 1996 event when the governor collapsed and was briefly unconscious at a graduation ceremony as a possibility.\n\nHis campaign said he was able to speak at the ceremony and receive an honorary degree despite suffering from the flu and that Mr. Weld ended up in the hospital that night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
