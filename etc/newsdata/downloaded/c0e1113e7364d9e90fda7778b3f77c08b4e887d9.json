Frick 63) Subs not used: Brandle, Eberle, Frommelt, Kardesoglu, Lo Russo, Majer, Meier, Sele Booked: Rechsteiner Italy: Sirigu, Di Lorenzo, Mancini, Romanogli, Biraghi (Bonucci 88), Zaniolo (El Shaarawy 63), Cristante, Verratti, Bernadeschi (Tonali 73), Belotti, Grifo Subs not used: Acerbi, Bardella, Jorginho, Gollini, Immobile, Insigne, Izzo, Meret, Spinazzola Booked: Tonali Goals: Bernadeschi 2, Belotti 70, 90+2, Romagnoli 77, El Shaarawy 82 Ref: Andris Treimanis (Latvia)\n\nLiechtenstein were not cowed and shortly after the restart Sirigu denied Salanovic once again.\n\nNicolo Zaniolo was next to try his luck for Italy, the Roma youngster seeing his left-footed effort repelled by Benjamin Buchel.\n\nDespite dominating the space, Italy could not carve out another opening before the break and they were lucky to preserve their lead heading into half-time as Salanovic almost equalised, Sirigu reacting quickly to push his long-range drive behind for a corner.\n\nItaly returned to the field focused on turning up the pressure in pursuit of a second goal and Zaniolo went close to grabbing it in the 54th minute.\n\nBryan Cristante was next to threaten, with Inter Milan's Biraghi then trying his luck from distance.\n\nStill the potential for a Liechtenstein goal loomed over Italy and after the hour mark Sirigu had to keep FC Thun winger Salanovic out once again.\n\nStephan El Shaarawy gets in on the act as he fires into the corner for Italy's fourth of the night\n\nThose lingering fears finally faded when, in the 70th minute, Belotti made it two with a firm header from Vincenzo Grifo's corner.\n\nSuddenly Italy were off the leash and it took them only seven minutes to reach 3-0, Romagnoli connecting with El Shaarawy's short cross to nod the ball past Buchel.\n\nProvider turned scorer five minutes later as Shanghai Shenhua star El Shaarawy buried Cristante's through ball beyond an increasingly hapless Buchel.\n\nLiechtenstein's brave endeavours were forgotten by the time Belotti bagged his brace deep into stoppage time, the Toro hitman piercing Buchel's barricade one last time from a Giovanni Di Lorenzo assist.", "description": "The scoreline was perhaps flattering to Italy, as Group J basement boys Liechtenstein put up quite a fight, going perilously close to scoring several times through Dennis Salanovic.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758652-0-image-a-75_1571172328637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
