No decision was announced following the closed-door hearing, and it\u2019s unclear when a determination will be made.\n\nThere\u2019s no deadline for a decision, which is typically made in writing and won\u2019t require another appearance by Carter, according to Felix Browne, a spokesman for the state Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, which oversees the parole board.\n\nCarter, her lawyer and members of the family of Conrad Roy III didn\u2019t comment after the hearing.\n\nCarter was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter in 18-year-old Roy\u2019s death following a bench trial in which a judge - rather than a jury - decided her fate.\n\nThe judge found then-17-year-old Carter caused Roy\u2019s 2014 death when she ordered him in a phone call to get back in his carbon monoxide-filled truck that he\u2019d parked in a Kmart parking lot.\n\nThe phone call wasn\u2019t recorded, but the judge relied on a text Carter sent her friend in which she said she told Roy to get back in.\n\nCarter didn\u2019t take the stand at her trial.\n\nCarter\u2019s attorneys argued her texts were constitutionally protected free speech. The state Supreme Judicial Court, however, disagreed, upholding her conviction in February.\n\nCarter\u2019s lawyers have since appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the nation\u2019s highest court hasn\u2019t decided whether it will take up the case yet.\n\nCarter, meanwhile, began her sentence in February at the Bristol County House of Corrections in Dartmouth, the same jail where disgraced New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez served time for murder.\n\nCarter\u2019s case has garnered national attention and sparked legislative proposals to criminalize suicide coercion.\n\nThe case was the subject of a two-part HBO documentary that was released in July.\n\nLawmakers in Massachusetts have also proposed \u201cConrad\u2019s Law,\u201d which would make convincing or manipulating someone into committing suicide a crime punishable by up to five years in jail.\n\nA wrongful death suit filed by the Roy family against Carter was also dismissed with prejudice in April after being resolved privately.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Massachusetts officials are weighing whether to grant early jail release for Michelle Carter, the woman currently imprisoned for urging her suicidal boyfriend via text messages to take his own life.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Philip Marcelo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/texting_suicide_71620_c0-175-4196-2621_s1770x1032.jpg?83acd87eac7ee34952f9d579151e1594cb9142dc", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
