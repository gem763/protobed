New research is helping female athletes compete.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI always assumed that your period would doom your race,\u201d says the New Hampshire-based athlete and writer. \u201cI expected that fatigue and cramping would be detrimental to my performance.\u201d\n\nWhat Canney learned later, however, was that racing during a menstrual cycle is actually ideal because a woman\u2019s estrogen and progesterone levels are at their lowest, making their physiological impact minor. Turns out this can be an ideal time to go for that personal best.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s a good deal of urban myth and old wives\u2019 tales that surround a woman\u2019s cycle, and this extends into the athletic arena. \u201cThere\u2019s a dearth of information into the role hormonal fluctuations play with regard to athletic performance,\u201d says Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutrition scientist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. \u201cThe result is that women have not been equipped with tools to manage these cyclical ups and downs.\u201d\n\nThis speaks to the larger issue of scientific research that focuses more on males, particularly in regard to sport. A 2014 analysis found that only 3 percent of studies on sports performance between 2011 and 2013 even involved women. That\u2019s beginning to change, however, as a small group of researchers digs into the issues female athletes face because of their cycles.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing number of sports scientists who are including more women as their subject groups,\u201d says Clare Minahan, an associate professor at Griffith University\u2019s Sports Physiology and Performance School in Australia. \u201cThis leads to more consideration of cycles in response to exercise and training adaptations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnderstanding a cycle\n\nWhile there is still more to learn when it comes to the effect on each woman of her cycle and athletic performance, step one is to pay attention to each phase. \u201cTrack your cycle and overlay it with your training logs,\u201d says Sims, author of \u201cROAR: How to Match Your Food and Fitness to Your Unique Female Physiology for Optimum Performance, Great Health, and a Strong, Lean Body for Life.\u201d \u201cThen you can begin to work with how these phases affect your training and balance that with nutrition and hydration.\u201d\n\nFor instance, during ovulation, about 14 days before a period begins, estrogen will rise and hit its highest level. This may impact metabolism and the body\u2019s ability to store carbohydrates. which could negatively affect someone who is tackling a longer endurance event, Sims says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMinahan recommends, though, that before taking any steps, athletes get to know their bodies through each phase. Some women, for instance, \u201cduring ovulation . . . will also have elevated oxidated stress, or inflammation,\u201d so carbs would not be advised, she says. \u201cThe research is not quite there to make blanket statements, so each woman needs to work it out on an individual level\u201d based on her own experience.\n\nIn the early part of the luteal phase, which comes after ovulation but before your period starts, estrogen remains high and progesterone joins it. Bloating and fatigue tend to rule the day at this stage. Heart rate may increase, and performing in heat and humidity become more difficult because of an elevated core temperature. All are factors to consider when looking at racing calendars.\n\nWomen athletes can choose not to schedule big events during this phase, or as Sims recommends, manage it. \u201cThis is a phase where your central nervous system fatigue is high and progesterone levels contribute to sodium loss,\u201d Sims says. \u201cSo you can manage that by increasing electrolyte intake, for instance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMinahan says that she encourages women athletes to track their cycles and training and combine the two, then works to develop an individualized approach to nutrition and racing. \u201cA large number of athletes just don\u2019t do that,\u201d she says, but it provides a tool \u201cthat\u2019s very powerful.\u201d\n\nAfter her unexpectedly positive experience at the world championships, Canney went back and looked over past races and outcomes. She then tracked her cycles and could see correlations: Most of her best races lined up with times she was having her period. She has used this information to improve her training and performance, including adding a period track app to help with the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a mental shift for me,\u201d she says. \u201cNow that I\u2019m informed, I realize that I\u2019m in control.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne such app, FitrWoman, garnered a lot of media attention after the U.S. women\u2019s national soccer team revealed players had used it to help improve their training before their World Cup victory.\n\nAD\n\nDawn Scott, the team\u2019s high performance coach, told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d after the World Cup victory, that cycle tracking is \u201cone of many strategies that we deployed that helped us win. \u201d\n\nCreated by Georgie Bruinvels, an exercise physiologist with sports research company Orreco, the app uses information drawn from an extensive literature review to help women track and manage cycles. Scott had Bruinvels consult individually with the soccer team\u2019s players months before the World Cup began.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen women understand why they experience different symptoms at different phases in their cycles, they can adjust their approaches to nutrition and hydration,\u201d Bruinvels says. \u201cWe believe that female athletes can perform on any day of their cycles by making the right changes for those particular hormonal variations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe app provides both an explanation of the fluctuations occurring at any given phase of a woman\u2019s cycle as well as tips and recipes to help combat symptoms that might have negative impact on performance. There are several other period tracking apps on the market, though most aren\u2019t focused on athletic performance.\n\nSoccer players\n\nBruinvels says that like many athletes, the women\u2019s national soccer team members believed playing during their period would lead to poorer outcomes and were surprised \u2014 and pleased \u2014 to see how individualized sleep, hydration and nutrition strategies made a difference.\n\nAD\n\nMinahan says that information about hormonal fluctuations and their impact on performance is one of the most promising aspects of the emerging sports research involving women. \u201cSo many women have false perceptions about the impact of their periods and have never questioned those ideas,\u201d she says, and that affects their attitude about what happens to their bodies throughout their menstrual cycle and about what they can accomplish physically. \u201cGetting the correct information out is so important.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCanney says she is a better prepared athlete now, and the information has definitely changed how she thinks about her racing and training. Now, she says, \u201cIf I have a bad workout during ovulation or in the luteal phase, I know it was likely due to hormones and I cut myself some slack.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "There\u2019s a good deal of urban myth and old wives\u2019 tales surrounding a woman\u2019s cycle.
