REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\n\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and 35 cabinet ministers pledged their loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn at a ceremony at a Bangkok palace on July 16 but they left out the last sentence of the official oath, on upholding and complying with the constitution.\n\nThat caused uproar among opposition parties, who say it implies that Prayuth, who led a military junta for five years, may not feel bound by the rule of law.\n\nPrayuth was sworn in as a civilian prime minister in July, more than three months after a disputed election that opposition parties complained was skewed to all but guarantee victory for Prayuth\u2019s pro-army party.\n\nLast month, the independent Office of the Ombudsman said that Prayuth and his cabinet breached the constitution by failing to recite the full oath of allegiance in the ceremony, which was televised and showed the officials reading from a piece of paper.\n\nIt asked the Constitutional Court to rule on what needed to be done because an incomplete oath could mean that all of the government\u2019s actions could be seen as unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, the Constitutional Court issued a statement on Wednesday saying the swearing-in was between the king and the cabinet.\n\n\u201cThe oath to the king is therefore not under the review authority of any agencies under the constitution,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPrayuth scrapped the previous constitution when he seized power in a 2014 coup. He was army chief at the time.\n\nHe was not immediately available for reaction on Wednesday.\n\nThe current constitution was drawn up at his behest. It gives the military a significant role in politics, to the disappointment of pro-democracy activists.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Prayuth said he took full responsibility for the omission and apologised, while assuring the country that the government would function as normal. He did not specify how he would rectify the situation.", "description": "Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday declined to rule on a controversy over the new prime minister omitting a vow to uphold the constitution when he was sworn in as a civilian leader, five years after he toppled an elected government.", "authors": ["Panarat Thepgumpanat", "Panu Wongcha-Um", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428687169&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A10B", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
