Here\u2019s two answers", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: Week 6 had some stunning results but none bigger than the Cowboys loss to the winless New York Jets. As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 Dallas Cowboys safety Jeff Heath explained it plainly.\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Heath said, \u201cGuys are pissed off.\u201d\n\nCowboys players riding a three-game losing streak have more than one reason to be.\n\nThey\u2019re angry, even as they remain outwardly measured, that they\u2019ve started so slowly. In their last three games, the Cowboys have scored a combined nine points before the half while opponents have raced to 47.\n\n\u201cWe can play as well as we want to in the second half,\u201d Pro Bowl right guard Zack Martin said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re down, it\u2019s tough to come back. \u2026 We\u2019re built to get out and get off to a fast start and hold that league.\u201d\n\nCowboys players are angry \u2014 as they look to right their offense \u2014 that they\u2019re struggling to capitalize on big plays. Against the Packers, three interceptions derailed a 563-yard day on offense. Against the Jets, a passing attack without two starting receivers and both starting tackles looked to the run game to threaten. Instead, Ezekiel Elliott never gained more than 13 yards on any of his 28 carries. He was kicking himself about a 12-yarder he knew had potential for more. Ten times he advanced one yard or fewer.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Texans rocket into top five, Cowboys tumble from top half\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news and exclusive analysis delivered to your inbox\n\nNumber of Cowboys not expected to practice today.\n\n\n\nWRs Amari Cooper (thigh), Randall Cobb (back)\n\nOTs Tyron Smith (ankle), La'el Collins (back)\n\nCBs Byron Jones, Anthony Brown (hamstrings) \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIn your mind you start thinking like, \u2018OK, well, you got this guy, this guy out [so] tighten my game up that much more,\u2019\u201d Elliott said. \u201cBecause like that second run of mine, if I would have scored there, that\u2019s a different game. So, I mean, you can\u2019t press. You can\u2019t go out there tense. You can\u2019t go out there and force a big play.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to just executing our plays and not shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d\n\nCowboys players are angry, too, about shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the offense failing to convert in the red zone or the defense miscommunicating gaps on big plays, the units have struggled to emerge from the hole they\u2019ve dug in the three-game skid.\n\nAgainst divisional rival Philadelphia on \"Sunday Night Football\" this week, the Cowboys will look to channel that energy productively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always bad to be pissed and slam the table,\u201d said Heath, who doesn\u2019t describe himself as mad now or someone who feeds off negative emotions. But the defensive captain understands that teammates can channel frustration productively, he says, \u201cas long as you can do that and get back to just being normal.\u201d\n\nBeing normal is how the Cowboys hope to reverse course.\n\nElliott wants to keep running normally, or soundly, against the Eagles\u2019 No. 2-ranked run D that\u2019s allowed just 73.2 rushing yards per game. Sure it\u2019s tempting to chase an early touchdown when Elliott hasn\u2019t scored any of his five touchdowns this season in either the first or second quarter. But \u201cbad stuff happens,\u201d Elliott said, \u201cwhen you go out there and try to do too much.\u201d\n\nCowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott today.\n\n\n\nGetting ready to face Eagles, who bring league\u2019s No. 2 run D (72.8 ypg) pic.twitter.com/hY2c7kI5yh \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Cowboys defense also wants to hone in on that normality, or consistency, against Carson Wentz and Co. as they maintain a stinginess on third downs (25.35 percent conversion allowed) that ranks second only to the New England Patriots. The unit is irked by its infrequent takeaways, averaging less than one per contest. Their two interceptions in six games, like their 0.8 takeaway rate, rank among the worst five in the league.\n\nBut Heath says that urge to \u201cdo something special\u201d or make a big play to turn around a deficit is \u201cthe exact opposite\u201d of what his unit should do. He points to cornerback Jourdan Lewis\u2019 third-quarter interception of Sam Darnold as an example of Lewis simply doing his job well, following his instincts.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re down a couple scores and everything\u2019s going wrong, it\u2019s human nature to be like, \u2018All right, what can I do to change this game?\u2019\u201d Heath said. \u201cJust do your job and the ball hits you in the head.\u201d\n\nSo the Cowboys won\u2019t enter desperation mode as they fight the Eagles to claim first place atop the NFC East. Instead, the run game and secondary will seek consistency alone and leave any Hail Mary thoughts to the league\u2019s third-best passing attack.\n\n\u201cLast year, we were 3-5 before we really got stuff going,\u201d cornerback Chidobe Awuzie told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI feel like that kind of defined us as a team. Maybe somewhere along the way we kind of got comfortable or something. But I think it\u2019s always backs against the wall.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, it\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
