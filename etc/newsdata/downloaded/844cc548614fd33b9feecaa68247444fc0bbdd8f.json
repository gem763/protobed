Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), vice chair of House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, repeatedly and politely asked Homan to respect the time limits. Her requests, however \u2015 and banging the gavel \u2015 went ignored as Homan continued an anti-Democrat tirade, then loudly complained the hearing was \u201ca circus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a taxpayer! I\u2019m a taxpayer!\u201d said Homan, who retired from ICE in June 2018 and is now a Fox News contributor. \u201cYou work for me!\u201d\n\nFormer \u2066@ICEgov\u2069 Dir. Tom Homan shows no respect to \u2066@RepJayapal\u2069 during a House hearing today after going over his time, shouting out,\n\n\u201cI'm a taxpayer, you work for me!\u201d pic.twitter.com/kVK2VlWinG \u2014 Andrew Kimmel (@andrewkimmel) September 26, 2019\n\nJayapal said Friday that Homan\u2019s disorderly conduct offered insight into why ICE \u201chas become a rogue agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this is the way the ICE Director disrespects rules & Congressional oversight of his agency, it is no wonder that ICE has become a rogue agency,\u201d Jayapal said in a statement. \u201cHoman did a wonderful job of proving this point. P.S. Also clear he can\u2019t stand respecting brown immigrant woman\u2019s power over him.\u201d\n\nHoman, in an appearance Friday on Fox News, defended his behavior, saying he was just trying \u201cto set the record straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna sit there and let them tell lies about my president, tell lies about the men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE. ... At a certain point it\u2019s like, I\u2019m not gonna shut up,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because you have a gavel, doesn\u2019t make you queen of the day, it doesn\u2019t allow you to lie to the American people.\u201d\n\nRelated...\n\nTrump Hired A Cop To Run ICE.
