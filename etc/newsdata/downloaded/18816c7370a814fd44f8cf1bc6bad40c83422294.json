She became the first British woman to win a global sprint title with a dominant display in Doha, charging home in 21.88sec to take gold and break her own national record in the process. It was her second medal of these championships to go with her silver in the 100m. But when the 23-year-old was asked whether it meant she was the finished article, she shook her head.\n\nDina Asher-Smith wins world 200m gold to make history for Great Britain Read more\n\n\u201cThe Olympics is less than a year away so we\u2019ve already been thinking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my coach John Blackie and I still have some things to work on. In the 100m I didn\u2019t run the race I planned. I am still getting stronger and more experience physically and mentally. So hopefully there is more to come and it should be an exciting journey.\u201d\n\nAsher-Smith\u2019s victory has propelled her into the stratosphere of British sport but afterwards she promised global success would not change her.\n\n\u201cNot really because being an athlete is very humbling anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI train six days a week and I am still going to push myself to the limit. It\u2019s very unglamorous when you\u2019ve got lactic [acid], and you\u2019re on the floor. Ultimately you\u2019re only ever as good as your last performance.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nShe added: \u201cAthletics is a very unpredictable and at times unforgiving sport.\n\n\u201cI could run the same time next year and finish fifth in the Olympics \u2013 that\u2019s just how it goes. So I have to really keep my feet firmly on the ground and keep working hard.\u201d\n\nAsher-Smith also paid tribute to her parents and Blackie, who has guided her career since she began training at the age of eight. \u201cEven when I was little and I would try to jump over hurdles and do the long jump he said \u2018please watch yourself\u2019. He told me we could do some special things. He\u2019s been careful with my progression to hold me back. This medal is dedicated to his patience, intelligence and wisdom.\u201d", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith believes that her stunning world 200m victory can be a springboard to Olympic glory next year \u2013 and expects to get even stronger and faster for Tokyo", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/293f8ca3e33f36474fd453683ea57d982c2b44c3/306_144_3086_1852/master/3086.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=58cbf6944558e036b2a1d269c53d4716"}
