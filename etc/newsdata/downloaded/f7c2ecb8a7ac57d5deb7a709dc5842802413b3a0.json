That\u2019s an increase of 275 reported cases since last week.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned \u2014 with hundreds of new cases reported each week \u2014 that we\u2019re looking at a very concerning outbreak, very difficult to control,\u201d Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a press call today. \u201cThe data that we\u2019re getting does not suggest this has peaked. It doesn\u2019t suggest this is declining.\u201d\n\nThe CDC also announced that there have now been 18 deaths related to the outbreak. Researchers found that about 70 percent of individual injuries were to male patients, and 80 percent were to patients under age 35. The deaths were a different story \u2014 people who died in the outbreak were older, ranging in age from 20s to 70s, with an average age of 49.5. Women also make up a larger proportion of the fatal cases, but investigators cautioned that, with just 18 reported deaths, it was too early to draw conclusions from the data.\n\n\u201cI wish we had more answers\u201d\n\nThe vast majority \u2014 78 percent \u2014 of the injury cases used products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), while 17 percent only reported using nicotine-containing products. But beyond that, answers as to what was causing the outbreak remained sparse.\n\n\u201cI wish we had more answers regarding the specific harmful products or components that are causing these illnesses,\u201d Schuchat said.\n\nThe investigation into what is causing the injuries, which can leave lungs riddled with symptoms resembling chemical burns, is being led by the FDA.\n\n\u201cThis is a complex investigation, unlike any we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Judy McMeekin, the deputy associate commissioner for regulatory affairs at the FDA. She said that many of the samples that investigators have collected from patients haven\u2019t had much liquid in them, limiting both the number and types of tests that are possible.\n\n\u201cThe samples we are continuing to evaluate show a mix of results, and no one substance has been identified in all of the samples,\u201d McMeekin said.\n\nBecause of the continued uncertainty into what is causing the disease, the CDC has strengthened its warnings for people who use e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWith all the data that I\u2019ve been seeing, I don\u2019t know what is safe right now\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the continued occurrence of life-threatening new cases, the CDC recommends that people refrain from using e-cigarette or vaping products, particularly those containing THC,\u201d Schuchat said.\n\nInvestigators continue to especially warn against people buying products off the street or from friends. \u201cIt is pretty much impossible for you to know what is in the e-cigarette or the vaping product that you\u2019re getting,\u201d Schuchat said, \u201cparticularly THC-containing products bought off the street or bought from social sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all the data that I\u2019ve been seeing, I don\u2019t know what is safe right now,\u201d she continued.", "description": "More than 1,080 people have come down with a serious lung injury related to vaping, as government researchers continue to investigate the cause of the outbreak.
