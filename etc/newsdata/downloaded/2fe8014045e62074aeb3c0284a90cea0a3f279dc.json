It\u2019s a small, self-contained convection oven, there\u2019s no actual frying involved, not in the traditional sense, anyway. (Oh and what\u2019s a convection oven? Don\u2019t worry, I got ya: it\u2019s an oven with a fan that sends hot air circulating around to ensure even cooking.)\n\nSo why is it called an air fryer if it\u2019s just a countertop convection oven? Because the heat created by these appliances gives you food with a consistency much like fried foods meaning, in proper culinary lexicon, amazing. Foods come out crisped and well-roasted and, with the addition of a bit of oil to the cooking chamber, with that rich, oily (or fatty, depending on what you cook with \u2013 and it\u2019s OK to admit you like fried foods) flavor you crave in fries, chicken, eggplant, fish, and so much more.\n\nThere are a lot of great air fryers out there. They\u2019re having a moment, really. I\u2019ve tried four or five different models out myself, but the one that has the honor of a place in my pantry is a BELLA Air Fryer that I can teach you to use with fewer than 20 words. Here we go:\n\nSet the heat\n\nSet the timer\n\nWhen the blue heating indicator light turns off, put your food in\n\nActually, I could probably have done it in fewer than 10. Let\u2019s try it:\n\nSet heat\n\nSet time\n\nWait for heating, then put in food\n\nOK 11 words, close enough. To overstate my point, this air fryer is remarkably easy to use, and it works every bit as well as other options out there with fancy digital controls and programmable settings and whatnot. The bells and whistles aren\u2019t always worth it, my friends.\n\nWe\u2019ve used our trusty BELLA to cook fries from scratch, faux fried chicken (the chicken was real, to clarify), roasted tofu, baked eggplant, fish fillets, and so many other things that would usually require heaping cups of oil. With the air fryer, I simply drizzle a bit of oil over the foods or else toss them in a baggie beforehand.\n\nThen I set the heat, set the timer, and fry up some awesomeness. Or convection bake up some awesomeness, but you get it. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted selects products independently and prices reflect what was available at the time of publish.
