The main index added 0.2% by 0706 GMT. However, the more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 index shed 0.3%, ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament was unlawful. Mid-caps were dragged lower by a 4.7% drop in merchant bank Close Brothers after its annual profit fell and it said Chief Executive Officer Preben Prebensen would leave. Among smaller stocks, Metro Bank sank 12% as the troubled lender ditched a 250-million pound bond issue on Monday after failing to attract investors, while ad agency M&C Saatchi slid 8% after warning annual profit would fall 5%-10% below estimates.\n\nRebound in banks, trade sentiment boosts FTSE 100; Metro Bank plummets", "description": "Rebound in banks, trade sentiment boosts FTSE 100; Metro Bank plummets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/389da45fab1145bdde37c1802bd5980b_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
