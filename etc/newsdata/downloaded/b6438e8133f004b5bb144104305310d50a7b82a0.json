Mitt Romney on Twitter Saturday, calling the 2012 Republican presidential nominee \"pompous\" a day after Romney said Trump's apparent requests of Ukraine and China to investigate a political opponent were \"wrong and appalling.\"\n\n\"Mitt Romney never knew how to win,\" tweeted Trump, who has often slammed the Utah Republican for his failure to defeat President Barack Obama.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nTrump and his supporters have denied that his requests for foreign governments to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate were politically motivated. They have said Trump was instead focused on battling corruption.\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" Romney tweeted.\n\n\"By all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" he added.\n\nExplainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\n\"Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics,\" Trump tweeted in response on Saturday. \"If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\"\n\nThe president also repeated his claim that his conversation with Zelensky was a \"perfect phone call\" and that the whistleblower who helped spark the impeachment inquiry was \"way off\" in his characterization of that was said. Although many experts and commentators have said a rough transcript of the call that was released by Trump helps corroborate the allegations against him, the president also repeated his claim that the transcript exonerated him.\n\nSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\n\nRomney has been a fierce critic of Trump since the 2016 Republican primary campaign. Though Romney was not a candidate that year, he was a leading voice among Republicans who hoped to stop Trump from securing the nomination, calling him a \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" whose \"personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.\"", "description": "\"The President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\" Romney said on Friday.", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0iVlVlU2PwM7cG1jEjSQLQ--~B/aD0xMjc0O3c9MjMzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/c7b8bd0e681ee24055c50207b3964033", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
