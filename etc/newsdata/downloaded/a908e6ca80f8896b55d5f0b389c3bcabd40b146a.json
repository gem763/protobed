Joe Walsh of Illinois and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld \u2015 have already jumped into the primary race against Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s steadfast support from Republicans coupled with his massive campaign war chest has created a daunting path for those seeking to unseat him from within the GOP.\n\nA Gallup poll conducted last month showed Trump with a 39% approval rating across political parties, but an 88% approval rating from Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to know you basically have no chance of winning the Republican nomination,\u201d Wallace told Sanford on Sunday. \u201cSo why run for president?\u201d\n\nSanford responded that \u201cyou never know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce every four years, we have a chance to have a national debate on where we\u2019re going next as Republicans and Democrats and as Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the thing that has been lacking in this debate has been an earnest and real conversation on debt and deficits and government spending.\u201d\n\nMark Sanford discusses his up-hill challenge to President Trump in the GOP primary. #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/dgqBe4X6VJ \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 8, 2019\n\nSanford, 59, was first elected to the House in 1994 before serving as South Carolina governor from 2003 to 2011. His second gubernatorial term was plagued by scandal after he told his staff that he was going to hike the Appalachian Trail for a week but actually traveled to Argentina to engage in an extramarital affair.\n\nThough he faced bipartisan backlash over the incident, he was elected to the House again in 2013. He was an outspoken critic of Trump during his most recent congressional tenure, drawing the president\u2019s ire and likely causing him to lose reelection in 2018.\n\nAsked for a response to Sanford\u2019s decision to run, a Trump campaign spokesman provided ABC News with a one-word statement: \u201cIrrelevant.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with more details on Sanford\u2019s announcement and background as well as reaction to the decision.", "description": "The former South Carolina governor is the third Republican to announce a bid against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7508db2400002d2277c711.jpeg?cache=aesdjdubxi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
