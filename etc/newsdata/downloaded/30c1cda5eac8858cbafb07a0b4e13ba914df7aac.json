Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., isn\u2019t buying the legitimacy of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint against President Trump \u2013 calling the allegations leveled against the president for his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201call hearsay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis seems to me like a political setup,\u201d Graham said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation.\u201d \u201cIt's all hearsay. You can't get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistleblower didn't hear the phone call.\u201d\n\nINTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING\n\nGraham, who has adamantly defended the president amid the whistleblower\u2019s allegation, said that he had \u201czero problems\u201d with Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky as outlined in the transcript released by the White House.\n\nThe phone call \u2013 and the subsequent whistleblower complaint \u2013 is at the center of the impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced on Tuesday.\n\nTrump had urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board. Shokin himself had been separately and widely accused of corruption.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \"look into\" the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid -- millions of dollars of which had been frozen days earlier.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is a sham,\u201d Graham said on Sunday. \u201cWho is this whistleblower? What bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis thing stinks.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
