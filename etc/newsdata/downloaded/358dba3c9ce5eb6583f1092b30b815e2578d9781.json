There is no lack of beautiful words. But when it comes to our actual emissions and our ecological footprints per capita -- if we include our consumption, our imports as well as aviation and shipping -- then it's a whole other story.\"\n\nThunberg said it was a great honor to be recognized, but she will decline the award until Nordic countries take the action she sees as necessary to change the world. She said there is a large gap between what science says is necessary and the politics that run the Nordic countries, and she sees no signs of the changes required.\n\nRead More", "description": "Teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg was awarded the 2019 Nordic Council Environment Prize, but she won't be accepting it.", "authors": ["Maddie Capron", "Christina Zdanowicz"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191011042449-greta-thunberg-lead-image-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
