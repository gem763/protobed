How was this person able to get through the net? This is amateurism that needs to be sorted out.\n\n'We can't leave 1,000 intelligence officers at Paris police HQ continue living in such fear and uncertainty.'\n\nFrench Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who has faced calls to resign over his handling of the attack after initially saying it wasn't linked to terrorism, attends the ceremony in Paris\n\nFrench Police officers attend a ceremony to honour four police officers killed by an extremist knife attacker in Paris last week\n\nPolice officers carry the coffin of one of their fallen colleagues during a ceremony at The Prefecture de Police de Paris\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron stands at attention by the coffins of the four victims of the October 3 attack at Paris police headquarters\n\nHarpon was shot dead following the rampage inside the historic Paris Police Prefecture, next door to Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nHis wife, Iham, was arrested soon afterwards and told detectives that he had \u2018heard voices\u2019 and was \u2018incoherent and suffered a dementia attack\u2019 the night before.\n\nShe has since been released from custody, and has returned to the flat they shared in the Paris suburb of Gonesse.\n\nHarpon and his wife were both registered as profoundly deaf and have two children aged nine and three.\n\nHe originally came from the French overseas territory of Martinique, and is believed to have spent time planning the worst loss of French police lives in a single day since World War II.\n\nHarpon had converted to Islam 18 months ago, and his wife is also a Muslim who comes from an Arab background.\n\nThe nature of the attack corresponded with similar ones carried out by terrorists affiliated to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.\n\nAn investigation as now been launced to see if Harpon was in contact with other Islamists intent on death and destruction.\n\nColleagues described Harpon as a previously trusted employee who had full security clearance to work in the Prefecture\u2019s IT department.\n\nThere have been calls for the resignation of Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who assisted at today\u2019s ceremony, when the four dead officers received posthumous Legion of Honour medals.\n\nMichael Harpon, 45, was shot dead following the rampage inside the historic Paris Police Prefecture, next door to Notre Dame Cathedral\n\nMilitary personnel block the bridge near Paris Police headquarters after the knife rampage", "description": "Investigators searching the home of Paris knife attacker Mickael Harpon have discovered USB drives containing the details of several dozen of his colleagues at the Pr\u00e9fecture de Police.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline", "Peter Allen In Paris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19438756-0-image-a-13_1570534564626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
