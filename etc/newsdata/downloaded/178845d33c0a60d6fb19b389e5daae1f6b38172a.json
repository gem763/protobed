The protesters then launch into a song and dance of \u201cBaby Shark\u201d to calm the child. The video is both sweet and uplifting. It\u2019s also surprising, because a Lebanese crowd acting in unison is such a rarity.\n\nOn Thursday , Lebanese from all walks of life took to the streets to protest corruption, and as of this writing the crowds keep getting bigger, louder, and more united. The crowds on Sunday were estimated to be 1.3 million people, 20 percent of the population. What seems to have set off the protests was the government\u2019s announcement of a tax on calls made using WhatsApp and other free online applications, supposedly to raise revenue during a fiscal crisis.\n\nThe populace had protested a number of times before. In March 2005, in what became known as the Cedar Revolution, a huge protest erupted against the Syrian troops who, more than five years after the official end of the 15-year civil war, still occupied parts of Lebanon; that demonstration was followed by counterprotest by Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian groups. In 2015, people took to the street to protest the government\u2019s mishandling of garbage collection \u2014 huge heaps of trash were left on the streets for months because government factions were openly jockeying for a piece of the next contract with the private company that picks up refuse.\n\nAlthough the 2015 protests were the first in quite a while to attract people from all the religious sects of Lebanon, the outcry itself was directed at some of the leaders, not all. In this latest round, however, the demonstrations seem to cut across sectarian and class lines and they are happening all over the country, from Tripoli up north to Tyre way down south, in big cities, suburbs and villages. And all the leaders of Lebanon are being held to account.", "description": "A tax on WhatsApp calls opens the floodgates of anger over corruption and Lebanese from all sects pour into the streets.", "authors": ["Rabih Alameddine"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21Alameddine/21Alameddine-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
