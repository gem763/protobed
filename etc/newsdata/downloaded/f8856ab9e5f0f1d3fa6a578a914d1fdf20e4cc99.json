But before her son, now 14, was born in 2005, she didn't realize the extent of the nation's need for Braille educators and services for blind children.\n\nThere is a national shortage of educators who know and can teach braille, and it\u2019s leaving children who need their services in a dire predicament.\n\nThe importance of Braille as a code to access literacy\n\nBraille is an essential skill for those without the ability to read and write print due to visual impairment or loss and provides a way for them to access literacy. However, less than 10% of legally blind people in the U.S. read Braille, according to a 2009 report from the National Federation of the Blind.\n\nPHOTO: There is shortage of braille educators in the United States. (Braille Institute) More\n\nThe lack of Braille education dramatically affects a person with impaired vision's ability to find work. Over 70% of working-age adults with significant vision loss are not employed full time, according to Cornell University\u2019s disability statistics.\n\nAbout 90% of blind or severely visually impaired people who are employed use Braille, according to the 2012 Report of the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.\n\nCurrently, 84% of blind children attend public school and Braille instruction can be offered as little as an hour per week, reports the The National Braille Press.\n\n(MORE: Blind woman with autism singing 'Part of Your World' has us speechless)\n\nWhile technology is inching in the right direction by including services like speech-to-text, standard on some devices, there is still a long way to go to make all the features of the modern world accessible to those with vision impairment or loss.\n\n(MORE: Mom captures the magical moment when blind son visits Santa Claus)\n\nAnd misconceptions remain about the importance of Braille.\n\n\"Sometimes it\u2019s a misunderstanding on the part of sighted people who think why can\u2019t some people just listen to information? We have audiobooks, we have recorded information. But until we stop teaching print reading and writing to children who are sighted, we have no justification for stopping Braille reading and writing instruction for students who are blind or visually impaired,\" Cay Holbrook, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has been preparing teachers to instruct Braille for over 20 years, told \"GMA.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about creating people who can go to a book and find information -- it\u2019s about creating people who love to read, who love to read and write, who gather information as a part of their lives,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd certainly employment is dependent on a level of reading and writing and access to information that\u2019s only available if the child has been taught.\u201d\n\nPHOTO: There is shortage of braille educators in the United States. (Braille Institute) More\n\nTo be clear, Braille is not a language, it\u2019s described as a code to access literacy. By knowing Braille, many students can go on to achieve great things, according to Kateri Gullifor, who has been teaching Braille for a decade and recently won the 2019 Braille Teacher of The Year award from the Braille Institute.\n\n\u201cI have a student who is in AP chemistry and honors calculus ... and legally blind,\u201d Gullifor said, adding that another one of her former students is living in New York and studying law. \"To watch someone learn to read with their fingers is one of the most fascinating things you\u2019ll ever watch.\"", "description": "Coleman, 40, now works as a superintendent for the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, in Austin, and is an advocate for Braille education.
