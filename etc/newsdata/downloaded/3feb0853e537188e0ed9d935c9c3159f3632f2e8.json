In a direct listing, companies don't use banks to distribute and price new shares, but rather open up the public market to stock owned by existing stakeholders.\n\n\"I think Silicon Valley has been on the bad end of a bad joke for about four decades now, in terms of the way the traditional IPO process works,\" Gurley said. \"The more I study and contrast it with direct listings, the more I realize that.\"\n\nGurley pointed to research from Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and business professor at the University of Florida, which shows that top investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies continue to underprice IPOs, meaning companies are giving away upside to new investors. Based on Ritter's data, he estimates that Silicon Valley companies have handed over more than $170 billion as a result of underpricing.", "description": "Bill Gurley of venture firm Benchmark says there are significant discrepancies between IPOs and direct listings that start-ups shouldn't ignore.", "authors": ["Annie Palmer"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105152111-NUP_182671_1248.JPG?v=1524502254", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
