I really should do a lotto,' Mandy Maysey told The Sunday Project.\n\nJasmine said she regularly hurts herself as one of her tics involves her slapping herself in the face.\n\nShe also slaps her mother, which she says she 'hates every second of,' which has led younger sister Isabelle to develop the same tic.\n\nMandy says tics are suggestive and that if somebody else has a certain tic, it's quite easy for them to pick that up.\n\nOldest of the three Connor revealed his Tourrette's only appeared four years ago.\n\n'It first manifested when I was about 21 as a head nod and it's kind of escalated continuously from then. In adult life I've kind of had to learnt to navigate a whole new world,' he said.\n\nTourettes affects about 1 in 100 kids, yet the cause remains a mystery.\n\nMandy says that tics are suggestive and that if somebody else has a certain tic it's quite easy for them to pick that up\n\n'When you go out in public you really have to develop a thick skin,' Mandy says\n\nResearch indicates those under 21 are more commonly affected - as are boys generally more likely than girls to develop the condition.\n\nThe symptoms are thought to lessen with age, however, those with the condition must learn to manage it for a lifetime.\n\n'When you go out in public you really have to develop a thick skin. I can understand for some people it's confronting to hear the language that comes out of my beautiful children's mouths. But that's just part of life, they can't help it and they have no intent,' Mandy said.\n\nMandy says she allows herself to cry but then quickly finds her composure - realising that she is in a supporting role for her children and needs to be there for them.\n\n'I reserve myself a pity party two or three times a week if I need it I will have a cry,' she said.\n\n'I will drive in my car or listen to a sad song, I will bawl my eyes out or I'll sit in the shower 10 minutes... and then regroup and say ''right, OK, that's enough''.'", "description": "Australian mother Mandy Maysey's children Connor, 25, Jasmine, 12, and Isabelle, 6, are constantly plagued by involuntary body movement and verbal tics - involving obscene language.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/13/19653528-0-image-a-2_1570968084192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
