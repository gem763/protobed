Ashes fourth Test: England player ratings 1/11 Rory Burns - 6/10 Offered another example of his admirable application with a first-innings 81, confirming his status as the most prolific opener in the series, only to bag a three-ball duck in the second. AFP/Getty Images 2/11 Joe Denly - 5 Shuffled back up to the top of the order and showed the right kind of resolve as England searched for a draw, holding out for 123 balls. Will be on duty at the Oval but at 33, for how much longer? AFP/Getty Images 3/11 Joe Root - 5 Made a battling 71 on day three then became the first England captain to make three ducks in a series when Pat Cummins bowled him with a snorter on the fourth evening. A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jack Leach - 5 Will forever rue the front-foot no-ball that cost England the best part of 100 runs from Steve Smith's bat, but plugged away and turned in another diligent tail-end defence.

Action Images via Reuters\n\n\u201cA day that should have been very special for him was marred by people raking stuff up from 25 years ago.\n\n\u201cI am not denying there is a very serious issue behind all this, but he said he definitely didn\u2019t do it. I have spoken to him about the matter and I believe him when he said there was no way he would have done what he was accused of.\n\n\u201cIt is an unfortunate cloud that he will have to defend as well as he defended any new ball in his career.\u201d\n\nAsked if the knighthood should be rescinded, Gower, who played 31 Tests alongside Boycott for England, replied: \u201cOh God, no.\u201d\n\nGower is set to begin his final days working for Sky Sports when the concluding Ashes Test gets under way at the Oval on Thursday.\n\nThe 62-year-old\u2019s contract has not been renewed by the broadcaster.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave and that is the honest truth,\u201d added Gower. \u201cI will feel sad because it has been part of my life for 20 years.\n\n\u201cI was told by the Sky hierarchy that there is an evolution in how television works. One understands that things change, but one doesn\u2019t have to necessarily agree with the decision.\n\n\u201cIt is just hard to accept. That is perfectly natural. I would rather be carrying on than hanging up the mic.\u201d\n\nOnly Alastair Cook, Graham Gooch and Alex Stewart scored more runs than the 8,231 Gower managed during his 14-year international career.\n\nGower captained England during the historic 1985 Ashes triumph, but he also skippered the side in two 5-0 whitewashes against the West Indies, and was replaced as captain in 1986.\n\nJoe Root\u2019s leadership is under the spotlight after England\u2019s failure to regain the Ashes, but Gower has urged England\u2019s selectors to stick with the 28-year-old.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be changing it at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have invested in Joe. He might not be England\u2019s finest captain but that takes time to earn.\n\n\u201cSix months ago, everybody was saying Joe has got the hang of this after England beat Sri Lanka. Then England lose to the West Indies and don\u2019t regain the Ashes.\n\n\u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be determined on the absolute result as to how good you are as a captain. It depends who you play against and how your players play for you.\u201d\n\nPA\n\nDavid Gower is touring the UK theatres this autumn with On the Front Foot.
