In fact, the average person loses between two and five lashes every day.\n\nAnd although it's clear that we're a nation of false lash lovers in seeking an instant impact, can a quick slick of eyelash serum give you longer, fuller lashes? And what exactly does this treatment entail?\n\nThe results-driven RapidLash eyelash enhancing serum has over 3,000 reviews on Amazon\n\nOne eyelash serum that has a solid reputation for lengthening lashes and has subsequently won several awards is RapidLash Eye Lash Enhancing Serum (\u00a326.29).\n\nCelebrating its 10th anniversary this year, the lash enhancing serum claims to 'help boost the appearance of eyelashes, making them look stronger and longer in just 30 days'.\n\nApplication is straightforward. You simply apply RapidLash (daily in the evening) from the inner corner of the eye outwards to the base of the upper lash using the applicator brush.\n\nThe fan favourite eyelash serum is formulated with Hexatein 1 Complex, scientifically advanced blend of poly-peptides, amino acids, nourishing pumpkin seed extract, and highly beneficial biotin and panthenol, that helps hydrate, nurture lashes and stimulate the lash's hair follicle.\n\nThis exclusive blend is designed to do a whole host of good things for your eyelashes, but does it really work to help improve the overall appearance of eyelashes?\n\nWell, nearly 3,000 Amazon shoppers think so.\n\n'Really impressed with this serum.' writes one reviewer. 'After daily use for the past 8 to 10 weeks my lashes have improved hugely. Was feeling upset about my lashes being short, straight and sparse so was skeptical but thought I'd try this serum - so glad I did.\n\nAlthough RapidLash (left) is the brand's star product, their RapidBrow eyebrow enhancing serum has also notched up a slew of positive reviews on Amazon\n\n'Now they are so lovely and long and curl upwards. Will certainly continue to use this and hopefully they will thicken in volume too so I have a false lash effect. Definitely recommend this.'\n\nAnother agreed and even went as far to say it worked so well they had to stop using it: 'This product WORKS. After about 4 weeks I suddenly noticed my eyelashes were very long. It worked so well I had to stop using it.'\n\nMany Amazon customers who have awarded RapidLash an average of 3.8 stars also highlight that you have to be consistent and patient with the applications, as once you stop, so does the growth.\n\nIt's not just enthusiastic testimonials that are winning over more and more loyal customers, there's also impressive before and after photos.\n\nRumour has it, even Meghan Markle is a fan of the lash enhancing serum.\n\nLifetech, the brand that creates RapidLash, also makes a popular eyebrow enhancing serum named RapidBrow that helps improve the appearance of eyebrow density and has also notched up a slew of positive reviews on Amazon.\n\nCheck out our discount section for deals and offers.\n\nMailOnline may earn commissions on sales from the links on this page.", "description": "As well as framing our eyes, and creating the foundation for us to create a variety of different looks, eyelashes play a vital role in protecting our eyes from everything from dust, liquids and general debris.", "authors": ["Emily Knott For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20042334-0-image-a-212_1571761543626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
