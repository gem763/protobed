And while the premise might sound more silly than serious, the book - like the video series - is actually full of real meals and desserts that transcend their sometimes ridiculous fictional origins.\n\nThere are a few recipes you\u2019ll marvel at but probably never want to make, like Buddy the Elf\u2019s candy-laden pasta dish from the movie \u201cElf\u201d or Jake the Dog\u2019s bizarre \u201cperfect sandwich\u201d from the cartoon \u201cAdventure Time,\u201d which includes human tears as an ingredient. But even with these, Rea lays out the steps to recreate them in actual, edible form.\n\nMost of this beautiful hardcover book, though, is filled with dishes you\u2019d want to dig into even if they didn\u2019t have a pop-culture connection.\n\nRea\u2019s recipe for flavorful, yogurt-marinated Palestinian chicken really is as good as Larry David says it is during a season eight episode of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d And Rea\u2019s version of the mushroom soup recipe that Elaine is determined to get from the \u201cSoup Nazi\u201d on \u201cSeinfeld\u201d really is sublime, and not difficult to replicate.\n\nThough he points out in the book\u2019s surprisingly moving introduction that he\u2019s not a professional chef, Rea brings a remarkable professionalism to the authenticity of his recipes. His luscious strudel, inspired by the film \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d includes dough painstakingly made from scratch.\n\nFans might be a bit disappointed, in fact, by the shortage of explanation about how these recipes fit into the stories that inspired them. Beyond the name of the show or movie, Rea says little or nothing about that.\n\nThe focus is on the food. And the more tangential a recipe\u2019s connection to pop culture - like the beef Wellington only casually mentioned in a flirtatious riff delivered by John Slattery\u2019s Roger Sterling on an early episode of \u201cMad Men\u201d - the more determined Rea seems to be to offer the best and most authentic version possible.\n\nThe recipes are laid out with detailed instructions amid gorgeous photography, and Rea explains how he chose the ingredients and created the dishes. Each recipe includes his personal \u201cverdict\u201d on how good it really tastes.\n\nSome dishes, it seems, are better left on the screen, including Liz Lemon\u2019s Cheesy Blasters (an artery-clogging mix of hot dogs stuffed with Monterey jack cheese, wrapped in a frozen pizza, from \u201c30 Rock\u201d) and Dothraki Blood Pie from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which has as its primary ingredient a full pound of pork fat, finely diced.\n\nThe verdict on that one, according to Rea: \u201cDothraki Blood Pie is pretty gross.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cprison gravy\u201d from \u201cGoodfellas\u201d will elevate your next spaghetti dinner. And Rea swears by his recipe for confit byaldi (better known as ratatouille, and included here in honor of the animated movie of the same name).\n\nIn this much longer followup to his 2017 cookbook \u201cEat What You Watch: A Cookbook for Movie Lovers,\u201d Rea has included nods to just about every genre of film and TV. You\u2019ll find Lake Trout and Pit Beef from \u201cThe Wire,\u201d followed on the next page by Principal Skinner\u2019s favorite coconut-based seafood stew from \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted the secret recipe for Krabby Patties or thought about assembling your own \u201cFriends\u201d-inspired Moistmaker sandwich out of Thanksgiving leftovers, both recipes are here.\n\nAnd Marvel fans, remember that sandwich Simmons lovingly sent along with Fitz on his first real mission during season one of \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d? It\u2019s here, along with a recipe for chicken paprikash just like the one Vision attempts to whip up for Wanda Maximoff during \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d Even the chicken shawarma that the Avengers refueled on after the exhausting Battle of New York is included.\n\nWhatever your TV or movie preferences may be, Rea\u2019s appealing voice and creative recipes might just inspire you to start cooking.\n\nIn describing the joyful reaction of Aziz Ansari\u2019s character, Dev, at having made really good pasta from scratch during an episode of \u201cMaster of None,\u201d Rea offers this encouragement: \u201cThis sentiment of excited accomplishment is an accessible, tangible sensation that we can manifest from our favorite pieces of fiction. All you\u2019ve got to do is try.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE - Melissa Rayworth writes lifestyles stories for The Associated Press.
