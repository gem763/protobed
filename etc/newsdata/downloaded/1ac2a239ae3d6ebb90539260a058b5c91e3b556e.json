I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nNowhere in the statement does Morey outright apologize, but it is clearly meant to at least partially douse a fire that has already cost the Rockets a fortune in China.\n\nRockets star James Harden also issued a public apology during the team\u2019s exhibition tour in Japan. From AFP:\n\n\"We apologize. We love China,\" he said, standing alongside fellow Rockets guard Russell Westbrook. \"We love playing there. Both of us, we go there once or twice a year. They show us most support so we appreciate them.\"\n\nHow Daryl Morey and the Rockets got here\n\nStory continues\n\nThis situation began when Morey tweeted a graphic on Friday night reading \"Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\"\n\nPer The Ringer, Morey was concerned about the safety of his friends in Hong Kong as protests rage in the city, a special administrative region of China, over a proposed (and since pulled) bill that would have allowed for the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland. Conflicts between protesters and police have frequently become violent.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet, as well as some others of his, was instantly hit by a torrent of replies from Chinese users angry that the GM voiced any support for Hong Kong protesters.\n\nWith one tweet, Daryl Morey has created an overseas firestorm for the NBA. (AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)\n\nThe Rockets have been one of the most popular teams in China going back to the days of Yao Ming, so the negative reaction to Morey caused Fertitta to quickly insist the tweet wasn\u2019t a political statement from the team.\n\nThose efforts didn\u2019t stop what happened next.\n\nLike the country does with most political dissent, Chinese basketball and media organizations have responded to Morey\u2019s tweet by trying to erase the Rockets from the country. The Chinese Basketball Association and Tencent, the NBA\u2019s digital rights-holder in China, blocked Rockets broadcasts in the country, while the Rockets\u2019 Chinese sponsors have been cutting ties with the team en masse.\n\nNBA releases statement on Morey\n\nMinutes after Morey\u2019s statement, the NBA released its own statement denouncing any offense caused by Morey in China. Like with Fertitta and the Rockets, the league \u2014 which clearly fears losing its inroads with the very lucrative Chinese market \u2014 attempted to isolate the backlash to Morey.\n\nNBA spokesman Mike Bass releases statement from league on Rockets GM Daryl Morey\u2019s situation. pic.twitter.com/GQyi1k7Qk4 \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 7, 2019\n\nThe statement was later condemned by U.S. politicians on both sides of the aisle as a \u201cblatant prioritization of profits over human rights,\u201d according to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nFunnily enough, the league effectively released a different statement for Chinese ears, give Morey\u2019s tweet a much harsher treatment.\n\nThe NBA's original statement:\n\n\n\nRecognize that [Morey's views] have deeply offended many in China, which is regrettable.\n\n\n\nTranslation it posted on Chinese social media:\n\n\n\nExtremely disappointed in Morey's inappropriate statement. No doubt he's severely hurt the feelings of CN fans. pic.twitter.com/pi5PdQq3q9 \u2014 Yiqin Fu (@yiqinfu) October 7, 2019\n\nNBA spokesman Mike Bass later told The New York Times\u2019 Sopan Deb that there should be no discrepancy between the NBA\u2019s statements in English and Mandarin, and that the English statement is the league\u2019s official stance.\n\nIs Daryl Morey\u2019s job safe?\n\nConflicting reports have emerged about Morey possibly seeing discipline over the tweet.\n\nJohn Gonzalez of The Ringer reported that team ownership have debated replacing Morey as general manager, but that report was soon refuted by Sam Amick of The Athletic and Marc Stein of The New York Times, who tweeted there are no plans for the Rockets to discipline Morey. Shams Charania of The Athletic has also reported that the NBA will not discipline Morey.\n\nMorey has long been considered one of the most successful general managers in the game, well-known for overseeing a stats-focused run of contending teams with Harden running things on the floor. It\u2019s hard to part with an executive as well-respected as Morey, but all bets could be off if the Rockets think their bottom line is in significant danger.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Rockets have seen an enormous backlash in China over their general manager's now-deleted tweet in support of a free Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tB5Qp_CkBvW1G9JMj1IGbQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MzguNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rq8LhAVUcxbSa5JQ884piQ--~B/aD0yMzQ2O3c9MzU4MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/1885cab0-6dcf-11e9-a3c1-8e72ee74b7fd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
