I am happy, but need to check if there are any [loopholes] etc.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the United Democratic Movement said it was time South Africa \"lanced this boil\" and got to the bottom of the allegations.\n\nIt wished the commission, headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, the best of luck in the six months it has to carry out its work.\n\n\"The UDM wonders who else will go down on the sinking Zupta ship. Who also had their hands in the cookie jar? The nation might be in for a rude awakening. Let\u2019s hope for the best.\"\n\nCriminal prosecutions\n\nParliament's Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services also welcomed the release of the terms of reference.\n\nCommittee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said the committee was also pleased that criminal prosecutions, where warranted, can flow from the process.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the ANC said the commission must get going without further delay.\n\nOutgoing ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told News24 that the allegations have \"left a black spot on our government and our country\".\n\nREAD: ANC calls for speedy start to state capture inquiry\n\nThe Office of the Public Protector said it has not yet considered the full terms, but it was not necessary to comment on the process any further.\n\nThe commission has 180 days in which to carry out its work.\n\nIt must also probe if any member of the executive unlawfully, corruptly or improperly intervened in the closing of the Guptas' bank accounts.\n\n", "description": "The Democratic Alliance says President Jacob Zuma and his son Duduzane must testify at the state capture inquiry, now that the terms of references have been released.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5489/51f57dee7aed4e1e8610b54e18601d2a.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-25"}
