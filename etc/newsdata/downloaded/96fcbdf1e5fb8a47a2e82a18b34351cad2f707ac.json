A simple dough is pressed into a bottom crust and squeezed into crumbles for the top. You can arrange the topping into a lattice, stripes, or other decorative pattern if you\u2019d like. The whole pan easily serves 24 and can be cut into smaller bars if you want to serve an even-bigger crowd. These bars are best the day they are made, but they can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Or, they can be frozen immediately after cooling and kept in the freezer for up to 1 month. Just make sure to thaw them before serving.", "description": "This delivers all the pleasure of apple pie \u2014 a buttery crust and topping sandwiching juicy spiced apples \u2014 without the need to roll out a dough A simple dough is pressed into a bottom crust and squeezed into crumbles for the top You can arrange the topping into a lattice, stripes, or other decorative pattern if you\u2019d like", "authors": ["Genevieve Ko", "Yossy Arefi", "Melissa Clark", "Sam Sifton", "Margaux Laskey", "Sarah Copeland", "Julia Moskin", "Mark Bittman", "The New York Times", "Martha Rose Shulman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/04/dining/apple-pie-bars/apple-pie-bars-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-04"}
