If you think media coverage can alter the actual level of support for candidates, maybe it\u2019s worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat distinction is important, because if you had to quickly describe the presidential primary to a friend who didn\u2019t follow politics much, you could do it pretty easily: \u201cJoe Biden entered the race as frontrunner, he had a rough first debate, but remained in front, and while there\u2019s been some movement among other candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, Biden is still ahead and still the favorite.\u201d Check out that RealClearPolitics chart. Biden\u2019s green line is at the top and stays at the top, even if it moves up and down.\n\nIt is possible that by historical standards, this will be a pretty boring Democratic primary. The Democratic party, shocked, horrified, and some might even say traumatized by Donald Trump\u2019s election, examined a field of more candidates than any party had ever seen before; debated radical new ideas like banning private health insurance, ending immigration enforcement, and free college for everyone; and then . . . picked the old reliable guy whom they remembered from the Obama administration. Few things would outrage the Twitter Left more than the confirmation that the offline Democratic party had no interest in revolutionary change and just wanted a reset button to go to back to the Obama era.\n\nWhether you loved the outcome of the 2016 election or hated it, it was indisputably the most dramatic one since the 2000 recount and perhaps since Ross Perot\u2019s independent bid in 1992. A huge GOP field was upended by a reality show star; an avowed socialist nearly derailed the Democratic frontrunner; the FBI director made several dramatic announcements during the race; violent confrontations often occurred outside Trump rallies; the guy who came in second in the GOP primary told the convention \u201cvote your conscience\u201d; a Supreme Court seat hung in the balance . . . You had to follow the news just to see what once-unimaginable development was going to happen next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLes Moonves famously declared that the Trump campaign \u201cmay not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d For much of the news media, the 2016 campaign was practically cocaine: high ratings, endless drama and confrontation, their ideal villain, endless opportunities for high dudgeon, sex, allegations of crime, allegations of ties to Russian spies . . . if you had read it in a novel, you would have said it was unrealistic. Unpredictability generates interest.\n\nThe national news media wants that experience again \u2014 although obviously many members of the media desperately want their preferred candidate to win this time. They\u2019ve committed massive amounts of correspondents, staffers, airtime, print space, web pages, graphics departments, and other resources to covering the presidential race. Nobody wants to devote gobs of money, time, and people to covering a race where nothing really changes much from start to finish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic presidential primary race appeared unpredictable, and thus potentially dramatic, with 26 or so candidates; but the summer demonstrated that a lot of those candidates never belonged in the race in the first place. If Eric Swalwell, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, and Seth Moulton had never run, almost nothing would have changed. Listening to some little-known Democrat tell a questioner, \u201cback in my home state, we took bold steps to tackle the challenge of climate change\u201d for the millionth time is not dramatic. CNN ran town halls with Bill de Blasio and Steve Bullock Sunday night, and ratings were 25 percent lower than usual. Cable news networks want to be fair, but they also want to retain and build their viewing audiences.\n\nFor the Democratic primary to be dramatic, Joe Biden has to be perceived as faltering or on the verge of losing his lead. Again, if that consistent Biden lead, and the former vice president\u2019s ability to keep it after a pretty lousy first debate, tell us anything, it\u2019s that his current supporters aren\u2019t looking for an excuse to jump off the bandwagon. This doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll never abandon him, but that they have considerable patience for moments where Biden seems confused or mixes up his words or feels the need to assure the country, \u201cI\u2019m not going nuts.\u201d Biden\u2019s supporters will abandon him when they no longer believe he can beat Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesterday, the Monmouth University Polling Institute unveiled a national poll with a result that surprised many: \u201ca virtual three-way tie among Sanders (20 percent), Warren (20 percent), and Biden (19 percent).\u201d If that is indeed the state of the race, it would mean Sanders had rebounded dramatically and that Biden\u2019s problems \u2014 his age, his gaffes, his perceived boring centrism \u2014 had caught up with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you look deeper, you find: \u201cResults in this release are based on 298 registered voters who identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic party, which has a +/- 5.7 percentage point sampling margin of error.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty small sample and a pretty high margin of error for a national poll. But the Democratic political world took that poll fairly seriously \u2014 in part because the result was genuinely surprising, and in part because that result helped the narrative that this Democratic presidential primary is a dramatic and unpredictable battle that is worth watching.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this morning, the Politico/Morning Consult poll has some new numbers as well: Biden at 33 percent, Bernie Sanders at 20 percent, Elizabeth Warren at 15 percent, Kamala Harris at 8 percent, and everyone else at 5 percent or below. In other words, the Politico poll shows the status quo: Biden\u2019s ahead by a healthy but not insurmountable margin.\n\nSanders and Warren are friends, they both represent a further-left wing of the Democratic party, and noticeably didn\u2019t take shots at each other in the last debate. But at some point, Sanders supporters and Warren supporters will realize that one of the biggest obstacles to their preferred candidate is each other. If Sanders and Warren consolidated their supporters, they would overtake Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSave Us from Whining Candidate Supporters\n\nTulsi Gabbard\u2019s fans didn\u2019t like this Corner post, and yes, at minimum, the Democratic National Committee should spell out exactly why they deem some polls valid for calculating support and some polls invalid. But here are the percentages for Gabbard in the last 15 national surveys of the Democratic field: 1 percent, 1 percent, 2 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 1 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 1 percent, 3 percent, 1 percent, 0 percent, 1 percent, 1 percent, 1 percent.\n\nIf the DNC is being unfair, they\u2019re being unfair to a candidate who struggles to hit 2 percent in the polls.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Gabbard as a candidate \u2014 her youth, her military experience, her ability to verbally vivisect Kamala Harris\u2019s record as a prosecutor under pressure. But she\u2019s much closer to the bottom of the still-crowded field than to the top. The RCP average ranks her tenth, but everybody lower than eighth place is below 2 percent. The DNC had an extremely generous standard for participating in the first two debates. They\u2019re finally trimming the field of the least supported candidates, and that might include Gabbard. Welcome to the big leagues, Gabbard fans.\n\nIf I had to limit the Democratic debate to nine candidates, I\u2019d pick Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg (based on poll numbers or in Buttigieg\u2019s case, fundraising numbers), and then another four for being interesting and not just reciting talking points: Gabbard, Andrew Yang, John Delaney for his willingness to deviate from party orthodoxy, and Marianne Williamson for, er, spiritual guidance. We\u2019ve seen Julian Castro have two solid debates, and yet no one seemed to care, and I\u2019ve heard Cory Booker ask \u201cwhy are we fighting amongst ourselves when the real problem is the Republicans\u201d enough times.\n\nIf I had my druthers, I might put Joe Sestak on the stage, too. As a candidate, he\u2019s such a throwback to another era, he should appear in black and white like \u201c30s Guy\u201d in that old Haggar Black Label commercial.\n\nHe\u2019s Not Running for President, He\u2019s Running to Be a Celebrity\n\nI\u2019ve said my piece about Joe Walsh and didn\u2019t plan on spending too much more time writing about him. But it\u2019s pretty weird to hear a guy who believed he had been hired to be Walsh\u2019s campaign manager describe absolute inability to reach the candidate at all for eight days. If Walsh suddenly had second thoughts about hiring the guy, fine, but say so. Don\u2019t leave the guy hanging.\n\nIn his announcement video, Walsh declared, \u201cWhen I first started thinking about running for president, talking to my family, close friends, people I trust, I started hearing about all the things I needed to do to test the waters: Start an exploratory committee, hire a speechwriter, get an image consultant, all the practical steps that conventional campaigns take. But these are not conventional times. These are urgent times . . . So to hell with all those conventional things.\u201d\n\nAll of those things are not window-dressing; they\u2019re what makes a real presidential campaign work. This is akin to declaring, \u201cthese are urgent times, so to hell with doing my homework.\u201d As recent days have shown, Walsh didn\u2019t even feel compelled to go through his Twitter feed and delete tweets that he had to have known would cause headaches \u2014 vehement defenses of the president, attacks on NeverTrump pundits, and approvingly repeating the president\u2019s profane epithet for Haiti.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd once again, this is not the most striking contrast with President Trump.\n\nADDENDA: Yesterday, I joined Cam at BearingArms.com to chat about red flag laws and the 2020 presidential race. As I noted later in the Corner, some articles have pointed to a Long Beach hotel worker as an example of how \u201cred flag\u201d laws could prevent shootings, but that worker wasn\u2019t really a case of using a \u201cred flag\u201d law. Law enforcement didn\u2019t merely seize his weapons; they arrested him. He is facing four felony charges: two counts of criminal threats and one count each of dissuading a witness by force or threat and possession of an assault weapon.\n\nI\u2019m okay with red flag laws as long as there are safeguards for due process, and they don\u2019t become abused, but existing law permits people to report potential threats and to request involuntary confinement and psychological treatment; although state laws usually require clear and convincing evidence that someone is imminently dangerous to themselves or others.", "description": "If Sanders and Warren consolidated their supporters, they would overtake Biden.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
