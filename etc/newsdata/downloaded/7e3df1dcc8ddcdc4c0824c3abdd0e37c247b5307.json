Georgulas also wanted Younger to pay for their son\u2019s counseling with a therapist who will affirm his transgender identity and his need for transgender hormonal treatments, which may begin at age eight.\n\nGeorgulas had diagnosed James with \u201cgender dysphoria,\u201d a psychological disorder that is characterized by a child\u2019s \u201cpersistent, consistent, and insistent\u201d assertion of \u201ctheir cross-gender statements and behaviors.\u201d\n\nHowever, when James has been with his father, he reportedly acts and behaves as a boy by his own choice.\n\nThe court prohibited Younger from dressing him as a boy or from sharing faith-based or biologically-based scientific teachings on sexuality, even though family friends who have observed James when he is in his father\u2019s care reportedly affirm he dresses and behaves as a boy by his own choosing.\n\nJames\u2019 \u201ctransition therapist\u201d reportedly continued to identify him as \u201cLuna\u201d and to place him on track for gender transition.\n\nAccording to the Texan, Younger and Georgulas were married in 2010 and decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\u201cThey requested male children through the IVF process that was successful, and their twin boys were born in 2012,\u201d the Texas reported and added:\n\nBecause of a family tradition to name the male children with the initials \u201cJ.D.Y.,\u201d and because of the biblical reference to the brothers of Jesus, Younger and Georgulas decided to name the children James and Jude. At the time, both parents were members of the Orthodox Church.\n\nGeorgulas has reportedly said James began to imitate female characters from Disney\u2019s Frozen. He asked for a girls\u2019 toy at McDonald\u2019s and asked to wear dresses.\n\nThe mother reportedly said she contacted the GENecis clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Center. She was then referred o Rebekka Ouer for counseling, who recommended a process of \u201caffirmation\u201d and thought that a \u201csocial transition\u201d for James should begin with the young child going to school dressed as a girl named \u201cLuna.\u201d\n\nThe battle reportedly escalated between the two parents when Younger learned Georgulas was \u201csocially transitioning\u201d James.", "description": "A jury decided against a father seeking to block his ex-wife\u2019s plan to start their young son on puberty blockers in order to facilitate gender transition.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gender-transition-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
