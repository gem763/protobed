This woman is writing on her laptop in bed wearing her lipstick. She looks quite ridiculous. She is wishing the teenagers downstairs would make less noise and will go down periodically to shout at them and to get some biscuits, maybe some cheese, a small snack that she needs to sustain herself every other paragraph or so.\n\nThis woman wishes she was like the young people she sees writing in caf\u00e9s or on the bus, who seem to be able to write anywhere. She wishes she wasn\u2019t so precious about peace and quiet and remembers she didn\u2019t used to be. In fact, she used to sit next to a man in a newspaper office who was covered in nicotine patches, chewing nicotine gum and drinking double espressos until he vibrated. Still, she always met the deadline. He didn\u2019t, so was in a constant state of torture.\n\nThings changed, journalism changed and she no longer had to go to the office. Indeed, when working for a rightwing newspaper she told the editor that doing so was making her depressed as they were all fascists. She was vaguely hoping to be fired. Instead she was sent flowers and told she never had to come in any more. She had been managed successfully, she realised later, which was an entirely new experience for her.\n\nObviously this woman is me and the lipstick thing is just weird. What can I say? It\u2019s something to do with my mum and putting on a brave face. No one sees it. I am alone, but it is a sign I am moving between the inner and the outer world. That is what writing is, an oscillation between the internal and the external. (Tip 1: find your own equivalent of the lipstick. It\u2019s the beginning.)\n\nWhen we ask, \u201cWhat are the conditions necessary for women to write in?\u201d we are really asking, \u201cWhat are the conditions necessary for women to think in?\u201d It\u2019s that simple. And it\u2019s that complicated. We are asking if what we think may ever be taken seriously or even valued. \u201cWriting is really a way of thinking \u2013 not just feeling, but thinking about things that are disparate, unresolved, mysterious, problematic or just sweet\u201d: Toni Morrison. (Tip 2: take inspiration from the greats, but don\u2019t compare yourself to them. Compare yourself to the mediocre men who flourish everywhere.)\n\nOutspoken women are \u2018unlikable\u2019. I have always had hate mail\n\nI am a journalist, I don\u2019t write fiction, but what Morrison advises is also what good journalism can do. It is about listening and thinking through all the information that is thrown at us, finding a voice somehow in the cacophony. No wonder I need quiet.\n\n(Tip 3: I often give aspiring writers this tip if I am teaching a journalism class and it\u2019s the one thing they don\u2019t want to hear \u2013 take off your headphones. If you want to report the world, be in it.) I know more about how people think by listening to the chat on the bus than I ever do going to Westminster. I knew who would win the election, because I heard the mums in the school playground wavering. I informed a notorious spin doctor of this. \u201cThe mums in the school playground?\u201d he sneered at me, seemingly unaware that such women even had the vote. His side lost. Labour, actually.\n\nListening, instinct, these skills develop, but how can one make a living while they do? This, of course, is what is so terrific about Virginia Woolf\u2019s A Room of One\u2019s Own, published 90 years ago this year, and an essay in checking her own privilege, a brilliant linking of material conditions to actual thought. \u201cWoman have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves.\u201d She could write as she did because she had an inheritance. (Tip 4: have a private income. Not really\u2026 but have another skill that can support you besides writing. These skills may feed into the work, not take from it.)\n\nI can\u2019t lie about the current state of my industry. Newspapers are in decline. We give it all away for free online. It\u2019s not easy now to make a career as a hack.\n\nThis is the point at which I should say I have been extremely lucky\u2026 (Tip 5: no one from my background is that lucky. You have to be good. And you are only as good as the last piece you wrote. Women need to front it out. Panic inside? Impostor syndrome? Trust me, it never goes, so live with it.)\n\nIf you come from a place where the top ambition for you was to work in Boots, then don\u2019t expect anyone to understand. When I started writing for the Guardian, my mother\u2019s reaction was: \u201cWe don\u2019t have that in Ipswich.\u201d When I used to go across the road from my council flat to get paper \u2013 as in those days everything was faxed \u2013 the blokes in the shop would say, \u201cJust doing a bit of typing then love?\u201d Even now a neighbour will say, \u201cCan I come round for a coffee? I fancy being a columnist.\u201d Everyone has an opinion so they think they can do what I do. As with novels \u2013 everyone has one inside them and that\u2019s where they should stay \u2013 everyone may have a couple of columns. The skill is to sustain it. (Tip 6: this is what I mean by front. Develop it. And fast.)\n\nMore and more, I see that what holds women back \u2013 besides money and social class, which of course remain the biggest factor within a media dominated by privately educated men \u2013 is something we can do something about. And that is this dreadful need to be liked. I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone who wants to be liked to write for a living. Some may love you, but a woman with an opinion is deemed unlikable. And, bizarrely, a whore.\n\nUse your conditions \u2013 the anger, the despair. They are your fuel\n\nI have always had hate mail and even death threats. In the bad old days at least people had to get a postage stamp before they could threaten to kill you. One of my favourite things ever was a floral notelet \u2013 remember them? \u2013 sent to me at the Mail on Sunday. It read CUNT.\n\nNowadays, of course, the hate and the bile is public as it\u2019s on social media and in reader comments. Often I find myself comforting young, talented women who are devastated by it. Look at Twitter any time of the day and any \u201coutspoken\u201d woman will be being mauled. Outspoken now simply means a woman who speaks. What we are asking of young writers is impossible \u2013 both to be so thick-skinned that all the abuse can wash over you and yet remain attuned and sensitive. It\u2019s a balancing act to which I have no answer but friendship and gin. (Tip 7: you need to develop some way of navigating social media and finding support there. It is there, trust me.)\n\nBy now, you have become nomadic \u2013 have laptop, will travel \u2013 and will be reading every goddamned thing you can get hold of, connecting left, right and centre. You get a piece published and the editor likes it. This is a gift. (Tip 8: it\u2019s become ever more rare, but a good editor is a mentor. Listen to them. They will slice and dice your best sentences and cut out your jokes and you will one day learn that a good editor is everything.)\n\nJust as it\u2019s going swimmingly there is that other issue, so let\u2019s face it head on. Children. Is it possible to write and have children? Yes, of course it is. Is it possible to write as much as you would like and have children? I don\u2019t know. I had a child long before I became a journalist. Writing can wrap around childcare. Or, circumstances mean it doesn\u2019t happen, or that writing is more important than reproduction. All I would ask is, can mothers think? As well as fathers is all I know. (Tip 9: there is no right way to do this. We are all different.)\n\nI may yearn for peace and quiet, but I have often written out of personal chaos. Why? Because anyone who writes wants to change the world. Word by word. Sometimes I feel I am fighting the old battles still and we are going backwards. Everywhere, I see guys analysing politics and young women writing confessionals: the old \u201cmen think/women feel\u201d dichotomy chunters on. That must change. The world described to us by cloned men centring on old party politics is imploding, the old systems are breaking down.\n\n(Tip 10: love what you do. If you don\u2019t love it and find it all rather lonely because it is, find something else.) Most of all, use what is already there. You cannot reinvent the conditions you are in, but these conditions are your fuel \u2013 anger, frustration, despair, revenge, love, silliness, need\u2026 and writing is your way to clarity, to understanding what is important. That is its power.\n\nKnow this in your heart. No one gives you power freely. You have to take it. Then own it. And whatever fee they offer you, ask for more.\n\nSuzanne Moore is appearing at Durham Book Festival in an event to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Virginia Woolf\u2019s A Room of One\u2019s Own, on Saturday 12 October", "description": "Give up wanting to be liked, live with imposter syndrome and love what you do.
