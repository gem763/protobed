We\u2019ve just had our first holiday together, which was wonderful, but that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u2019\n\nNo one wants their relationship to be constantly critiqued by the public, so what better way to avoid the pressure than to expertly hide from paparazzi and questions about your relationship?\n\nChanning was previously married to Jenna Dewan \u2013 who he met on the set of Step Up in 2009 \u2013 but the two divorced in 2018, remaining dedicated co-parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJessie J, on the other hand, was linked to American singer Luke James in 2015.\n\nChanning was married to Jenna for nine years (Picture: LaVeris/FilmMagic)\n\nJessie J and Luke James were pictured together at many events (Picture: Instagram)\n\nFrom November, by the grace of everything that is good, Channing and Jessie J began appearing on each other\u2019s social media accounts.\n\nChanning made his first public post about her in November, applauding the Price Tag singer after her concert.\n\nHe said: \u2018This woman just poured her heart out on stage at the Royal Albert Hall. Whoever was there got to witness something special. Wow.\u2019\n\nSomebody was smitten.\n\nIt was at that show that Jessie opened up about her issues with fertility and revealed to her fans that she probably won\u2019t be able to conceive.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t tell you guys for sympathy because I\u2019m one of millions of women and men that have gone through this and will go through this,\u2019 the artist said.\n\n\u2018It can\u2019t be something that defines us but I wanted to write [Four Letter Word] for myself in my moment of pain and sadness but also to give myself joy, to give other people something that they can listen to in that moment when it gets really hard.\u2019\n\nChanning being the perfect boyfriend and filming his beau perform in Brazil (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nCaption: Channing Tatum and Jessie J are seen hand in hand in London (Picture: Neil Warner/MEGA)\n\nHe was probably praising her for her bravery in opening up, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being adorable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was also his second Jessie J show in two weeks.\n\nHow many times can one listen to Price Tag before their head explodes?\n\nThe two began spending as much time they could with each other despite how busy they are.\n\nChanning would attend a multitude of her concerts while Jessie was spotted attending the Magic Mike Live show at the Hippodrome Casino in London.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until March that they were photographed holding hands and we all squealed with joy.\n\nFor her 31st birthday that month, the Step Up actor wrote on Instagram: \u2018Wishing you the happiest day filled with all the love and all the light. You came into this world on this day and lit it on fire.\n\n\u2018You have blessed our eyes, our ears, our hearts and our lives. So thank you for just being you. You are so very special. Happy birthday Baby.\u2019\n\nNever forget (Picture: Channing Tatum/Instagram)\n\nThe singer responded with the same level of adoration for his birthday, but other than that the two remained low key.\n\nIn May, the power couple were spotted in Disney Land after spending months avoiding photos.\n\n\u2018The reason we kept it a secret for as long as we could was because we wanted to really enjoy it without it being magnified into something that it wasn\u2019t yet,\u2019 Jessie shared on The Dan Wootton Interview podcast in June.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t go on a date with a guy twice for a dinner then fall in love\u2014well maybe you can, but that\u2019s not me. That\u2019s not who I am. I need time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, let\u2019s not forget about the saucy photo Jessie posted of Channing in May.\n\nWe haven\u2019t forgotten.\n\nChanning explained the naked snap: \u2018I lost a game of Jenga to Jessica Cornish. The loser (me) had to post a picture the other person (Jessica Cornish) picked\u2026 Smh and fml\u2026 I\u2019m never playing Jenga with her ever again..\u2019\n\nHow adorable are these two? (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nWe\u2019re begging you to play Jenga with Jessie again.\n\nAlthough the two are fairly open with selfies and funny photos on Instagram, they\u2019ve kept any time spent with Channing\u2019s daughter Everly a secret.\n\nBecause why would you want to tell people about that?\n\nKeeping Everly\u2019s personal life personal is important to the two, and Jessie began opening up on the idea of trying to have children despite her fertility issues.\n\nShe once said: \u2018I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s open and honest. Four, four-and-a-half, five years ago, I was diagnosed with this disease, which is making it harder.\n\n\u2018I was told I can\u2019t have children, but I don\u2019t believe it. I believe in miracles. I haven\u2019t given up.\u2019\n\nThe talented singer may not have given up but the stars are a little too busy and have not reached that stage in their relationship.\n\nImagine going to watch your own strip show (Picture: Instagram)\n\nMost recently in August, Channing and Jessie both announced that they\u2019re taking breaks from social media.\n\nThe actor then explained that he hadn\u2019t felt \u2018very creative on social in the last couple years now\u2019 and was \u2018gonna go and just be in the real world for awhile.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u2018I\u2019ll probably come back at some point. But if i do i want to have a direction or a clear point of view of why I\u2019m on here and what I\u2019m putting out there. Love ya! See ya after awhile!\u2019\n\nHis loyal girlfriend joined him on the break on 24 August but has since returned.\n\nChanning, on the other hand, seems to be enjoying the \u2018real world\u2019 so much he\u2019s never coming back.\n\nWith their relationship being kept private, it\u2019s always exciting to get a glimpse into their very loving romance.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
