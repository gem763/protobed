It was this sense of injustice that came to a head in June 2015.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the March 11 jackpot draw remained unclaimed, but 170 days after the draw and just 10 days before the winning ticket was due to expire, Putman called Camelot claiming he held the winning ticket.\n\nOlympian's PA apologises after video proves driver she accused did not endanger cyclist\n\nThe prosecutor added: \u2018He was lying. He did not hold the winning tricked, but a forgery created by Mr Knibbs.\u2019\n\nPassing sentence, judge Philip Grey said the \u2018sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud\u2019 struck at the heart of the integrity of the National Lottery.\n\nHe said: \u2018You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy.\n\nPutman\u2019s \u2018winnings\u2019 have yet to be recovered (Picture: PA Wire)\n\n\u2018Whatever the exact monetary split you and Mr Knibbs had agreed, you did not pay him what split he felt he was owed. The two of you fell out spectacularly.\n\n\u2018This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public\u2019s trust in the lottery itself.\u2019\n\nBoy, 3, with autism thrown out of shop for having assistance dog\n\nDespite his windfall Putman would later be sentenced, in 2012, to nine months for benefit fraud after claiming \u00a313,000 welfare support, while splashing out on sports cars and a new house.\n\nHis previous convictions also include the rape of a teenager in the early 1990s, for which he was sentenced to seven years.\n\nA Camelot spokesman said the matter was a \u2018unique, one-off incident over a decade ago\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018There were some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we\u2019re very sorry for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
