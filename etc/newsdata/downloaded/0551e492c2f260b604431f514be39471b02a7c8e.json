ECB meeting minutes then showed similar. view on the currency story could be swinging here,\" said Saxo Bank's head of European currency strategy, John Hardy, \"And the market is sensing that euro-dollar is the pressure point.\"\n\nPerhaps the main mover overnight though was a rally in China's offshore yuan, which strengthened to its best levels in more than two weeks after a Bloomberg report said U.S. and Chinese officials were reviving a currency pact first mooted earlier this year that stops further tariff hikes in return for commitments to hold the yuan stable.\n\nAs well as the ECB resistance to Draghi's moves, that could also have a read-across for the euro, Saxo's Hardy said, with the United States expected to lay out sanctions next week in retaliation for Europe's past aid for planemaker Airbus.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly flagged how the euro has been weakened by extreme measures such as negative interest rates, so he may effectively issue a \"cease and desist\" along with the sanctions, Hardy said.\n\nThere also was the Brexit tangle. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was meeting his Irish counterpart in a last-ditch attempt to revive a British proposal for a deal that the EU said falls far short of what is needed. picture - the more severe that Brexit is, in the short term, it's likely to lead to a lower value of the pound, a higher level of inflation and slower growth in the economy,\" Bank of England chief Mark Carney told reporters.\n\n'DIRE' TRADE SITUATION\n\nS&P 500 mini futures traded down 0.2%, though losses had been trimmed by a New York Times report that Washington would soon issue licences allowing some U.S. firms to supply non-sensitive goods to China's Huawei Technologies.

The tariff will be hiked. The situation looks dire,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) Securities.\n\nChina is unlikely to be willing to make an easy compromise with a U.S. president who seems increasingly vulnerable to domestic political pressure as opposition Democrats seek to impeach him, analysts said.\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump for the first time in a deepening partisan fight over a congressional investigation of the Republican president.
