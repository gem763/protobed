He\u2019s flaky, he\u2019s rubbish at returning calls and he spends way too much time staring at his computer screen. Worst of all \u2013 and this is definitely something he shouldn\u2019t put on his Tinder profile \u2013 everyone he has a romantic entanglement with winds up dead. Unpleasantly dead.\n\nShayla, Elliot\u2019s neighbour-turned-girlfriend from season one met a heart-breaking and brutal end at the hands of crazed drug dealer Vera. And then his oldest friend Angela \u2013 who he shared a passionate kiss with in season three, potentially sparking the start of a much-anticipated relationship \u2013 was dispatched by the Dark Army at the start of this final chapter.\n\nSo, where does this leave Olivia Cortez (Dominik Garcia-Lorido), the single mum Elliot seduced in order to steal a security code that would give him access to Whiterose\u2019s Cyprus National Bank account?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first it seemed ice-cold Elliot would stay totally focused on his mission \u2013 to get the code and get out \u2013 but Olivia\u2019s moving bathroom confessional about her struggles with drugs and suicidal thoughts helped to create a connection with the lonely hacker and, boom, the pair suddenly went all gooey eyed on each other.\n\nOlivia\u2019s final comment that she\u2019d told Elliot enough about herself \u201cfor tonight\u201d, suggests this could be the beginning of something serious. But is her arrival on the scene a game-changer for Elliot? And where does it leave his urgent mission to destroy Whiterose?\n\nHere\u2019s what could happen next\u2026\n\nOlivia inspires him\n\nCan we trust Olivia? (Picture: Amazon Prime)\n\nAs Elliot knows, the clock is ticking. If he doesn\u2019t bring down Whiterose he\u2019s a dead man \u2013 and dead men make even worse boyfriends than flaky, call-screening, computer obsessives. Before meeting Olivia, his prime reason for defeating Whiterose was to save Darlene\u2019s life, but now he has the tiniest glimpse of a potentially happy future for himself, will that hope help inspire him when the going inevitably gets tough? Does the show\u2019s creator Sam Esmail, who\u2019s described this final season as \u2018sentimental\u2019, have a happy ending up his sleeve for Elliot?\n\nHe\u2019s thrown off course\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know what happens to people when they first start a new relationship \u2013 they disappear. Trapped in a love bubble, they get distracted and everything else gets left by the wayside. Elliot knows he\u2019s in a dramatic race against time to stop Whiterose, so it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019d lose sight of his objective \u2013 and Mr Robot and Darlene would surely never allow that. But in such an epic battle against such a powerful enemy, the smallest lack of focus could spell disaster.\n\nShe\u2019s an agent for Whiterose\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Whiterose understands, it\u2019s the benefit of knowing someone\u2019s weak spot. She easily manipulated Angela with the promise of somehow resurrecting her dead mother; she\u2019s long exploited Phillip Price\u2019s thirst for power and riches; and she\u2019s keeping poor Dom in line with good, old-fashioned threats towards her family.\n\nOlivia\u2019s past problems with addiction and the loss of one of her parents makes her a near mirror-image of Elliot. They also make her a near-perfect combination of both Shayla and Angela. It all sounds too good to be true, doesn\u2019t it? So, perhaps it is. Perhaps Olivia, to use hacker terminology, is a honeypot placed in Elliot\u2019s way by the all-seeing Whiterose, to distract him from his mission \u2013 or to take him down.\n\nIt all ends in tragedy\n\nWill there be a happy ending? Unlikely (Picture: Amazon Prime)\n\nAs mentioned, Elliot\u2019s love interests have a habit of coming to a sticky end. And with the equally menacing Whiterose and Vera circling around Elliot right now, Olivia would be putting her life in great danger by taking things further with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not sure we could handle another tragic death of someone close to Elliot, so hopefully he\u2019ll do the sensible thing and channel that natural flakiness and ghost Olivia until it all blows over.\n\nMr. Robot continues tonight on the USA Network and will follow a day later on Amazon Prime UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
