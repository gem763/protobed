That\u2019s clever for many reasons, starting with the fact that talking often about his faith is a way for Buttigieg to blunt attacks that a gay man can\u2019t properly govern a Christian country like the United States. It\u2019s also clever in appealing on a gut level to Democrats, who\u2019ve been lectured for decades by the religious right on their moral failings. Now here comes Mayor Pete to assure them that they, not Republicans, are the true followers of Christ\u2019s example. Imagine how gratifying that must be for them.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m not even religious and I find his sanctimony intensely irritating. \u201cRight,\u201d you can hear Democrats saying, \u201cso put yourself in our shoes from 1980 to 2016.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not going to be the nominee but he might end up carving out a niche as a surrogate next year in which he travels around reminding Democratic audiences that, as it happens, their policy preferences match up letter-perfectly with \u201ctrue Christianity\u201d the way Jesus wanted people to practice it. (Coincidentally, the climate-change crisis also appears to require solutions that align in every particular with the pre-crisis leftist agenda.) The most obvious obstacle to that claim is abortion, particularly in an era when Democrats long ago traded \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d for \u201cwhenever a woman g-ddamned well feels like it.\u201d But he\u2019s already anticipating that objection; as you\u2019re about to see, he has it on authority from Scripture that God might be okay not just with abortion but with late-late-late-term abortion.\n\nAgain, in exact alignment with the modern Democratic agenda.\n\nWhether and how often the Bible claims that life begins at \u201cbreath\u201d is a question above this atheist\u2019s pay grade but it\u2019s curious to me that this supposedly mainstream understanding has escaped the attention of, for instance, the Catholic Church. I expect Buttigieg would say that he\u2019s not claiming that he knows God\u2019s mind on this subject but rather that pro-lifers can\u2019t know it either. Passages of Scripture conflict, you see. And when that happens, the only conscientious thing to do is to interpret the material in the way that\u2019s most supportive of, uh, infanticide.\n\nSeems to me like you might want to default to the Golden Rule when the Bible is hazy on what God wants, but doing that in this case would force Buttigieg to line up with the right on the most sensitive social issue there is. It\u2019s one thing to ask him to kill infants, it\u2019s another thing to ask him to kill his career.", "description": "Great.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/b-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
