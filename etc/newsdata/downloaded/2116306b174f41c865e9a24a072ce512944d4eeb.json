Year?\u201d I replied. \u201cWhat year at HBS?\u201d H-B-what? \u201cWhat year did you graduate from Harvard Business School?\u201d Oh, I get it now. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to HBS,\u201d I told him. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t have an M.B.A.\u201d After a long pause and scrunched-up face, he asked, \u201cWell, then how the hell did you get a job here?\u201d As I walked away, I murmured under my breath, \u201cMaybe I earned it.\u201d\n\nSo should you get a master\u2019s in business administration? These days a lot of people are rethinking that question. Applications are down, even at HBS and GSB (that\u2019s Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business\u2014get with the lingo). The number of GMAT test scores sent to two-year, full-time M.B.A. programs has plummeted since 2015. Last year 70% of two-year M.B.A. programs saw declining enrollment; in 2014 it was only one-third. Rats deserting a sinking ship?\n\nBefore I really pile on, it\u2019s worth mentioning that there are a few decent reasons to go. The first is pedigree. If you want to get a job on Wall Street or in private equity, you pretty much need an M.B.A.\u2014a golden ticket. But although these jobs pay well, they entail long hours chained to giant monitors. It\u2019s basically the mushroom treatment: Higher-ups will keep you in a dark room and constantly throw, let\u2019s just say, manure on you.\n\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images\n\nAnother reason to go is the networking (it only takes a couple of drinks for most graduates to admit this was their main draw). Business school is a great place to meet other up-and-coming climbers to get pulled up by, or better yet, pass on your way to the executive floor, bathroom key included. I constantly meet people who studied with former Microsoft CEO and GSB dropout Steve Ballmer. The final reason to go to B-school is that you might actually learn something\u2014like how to do macros in Excel.\n\nBut\u2014you knew this was coming\u2014man oh man is it expensive. HBS tuition is now $73,440 a year. Total costs are estimated at $110,740 if you\u2019re single and more than 150 grand if you\u2019re married with two children. That excludes the cost of your MacBook, let alone forgone wages. You\u2019d better get that Wall Street job.\n\nI\u2019ve dug into the curricula at dozens of M.B.A. programs, from Booth to Kellogg to Fuqua. They\u2019re all more or less the same: The first year has introductory courses in finance, accounting, managerial skills\u2014my eyes are getting droopy, too\u2014along with modeling and organizational behavior, each no doubt chock full of case studies that are probably no longer relevant. And virtually every program now has a mandatory ethics class, which awkwardly suggests that students had no ethics coming in.\n\nThe second year is a supposedly deep dive into finance or marketing or strategic management. Finance majors learn how the stock market works and about private equity. Sadly, I\u2019ve suffered many dinner party conversations with Wharton M.B.A.s telling me how famed professor Jeremy Siegel taught them secret investing tips: low multiple, dividends, blah blah. They were almost always wrong.\n\nAny halfway-on-the-ball undergrad could construct a virtual M.B.A. himself by taking a finance course and some in marketing and psychology, plus any course that teaches how to use spreadsheets. Then get buzzword-compliant and, voil\u00e0, an M.B.A. in a box.\n\nI\u2019m often envious of the networking capabilities of M.B.A. students, and of hearing \u201cI went to B-school with that guy.\u201d But that\u2019s old school. Today everyone is great at networking. If you don\u2019t know how to connect with a business contact through social networks and the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon principle, you were probably born too long ago. Heck, the only reason LinkedIn exists is the way it helps users find and connect with business contacts. Sure, it hasn\u2019t replaced being in an intimate study group with future successful business-folk, but it\u2019s a reasonable facsimile for a lot less than $250,000 and two years.\n\nAs far as jobs go, how do you get to be a product manager at Facebook? An M.B.A. certainly doesn\u2019t hurt, but it isn\u2019t a prerequisite. And when I surfed through course catalogs I saw very few classes that would prepare you for that job. Or to manage a team of coders at Google. Or to do product launches at Uber\u2014let alone to join a hot young startup destined to become the Uber of dental care, pet delivery or floor wax.\n\nAll this leaves the impression that, beyond finance, M.B.A. programs are still geared toward an industrial America that is shrinking\u2014much like B-school enrollment.\n\nHere\u2019s a tip that no M.B.A. program teaches: My editor taught me that if you ask a question in a headline, the answer is usually no.\n\nWrite to kessler@wsj.com.", "description": "You\u2019d gain some neat tricks and well-heeled friends, but the cost is prohibitive.", "authors": ["Andy Kessler"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108773/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
