She was taken to hospital for her injuries such as a bloodied ear (left) and her false nails were also ripped off (right)\n\n'She's been kicked in the head a few times and has been very dizzy. She's frightened and she is only still a child.\n\n'She was crying afterwards and asked 'why have I been targeted?'. She is a pretty girl and feels targeted because of that.\n\n'Nobody knows what has happened but I think it is has been instigated through jealousy, it is completely unprovoked and it has to all be down to jealousy.'\n\nAmy believes the jealousy may have been down to her daughter's talent. Jacee can model and sing and one of her videos, for Breast Cancer UK, has had almost 20,000 YouTube views.\n\nJacee (above) had told her mother she was meeting friends for dinner but instead went out to a club\n\nPolice were brought in on Sunday in the aftermath of the incident, near Passion Nightclub, in Holmeside.\n\nThe venue said it is carrying out its own investigation but was unable to comment further.\n\nJacee's nails fell off in the attack (above) and since then the family has received abuse on social media\n\nHowever, the Sunderland family have shared pictures of the injuries suffered in what Amy claims was a 'horrible, nasty attack' on her daughter.\n\nAmy also said the family have now received abuse on social media.\n\n'There's been horrible Facebook messages sent to us and I've had men calling up threatening us,' said businesswoman Amy.\n\n'They were asking 'where do you f****** live' - but I just thought these people must be idiots.'\n\nShe claims Jacee had told her she was going out for a meal with friends on Saturday night.\n\nBut, the teenager had secretly been planning a night.\n\n'I'd done it myself when I was her age, I'd tell my dad I was going to Pizza Hut then I'd be in the pubs and clubs,' she added.\n\n'But normally she is good and responsible and I had no issue with what she's done, just what happened to her.\n\n'She doesn't deserve this and I hope the police charge someone for what has happened.'\n\nA spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: 'Shortly after 4pm Sunday, police received a report of an assault near Passion nightclub in Sunderland.\n\n'The assault is believed to have happened around midnight on Saturday and reported to police the following day.\n\n'It was reported that a woman assaulted a 16-year-old teenager who was then taken to hospital with a suspected concussion.\n\n'Anyone with any information is asked to contact police via 101 and quote reference number 663 20/10/19.'", "description": "Aspiring singer and model Jacee Pink (pictured) was partying with friends in Sunderland early on Sunday when violence is said to have erupted at the Passion nightclub.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/00/20012650-0-image-a-57_1571700217274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
