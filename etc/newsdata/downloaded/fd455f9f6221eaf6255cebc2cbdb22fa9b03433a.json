Out of the window went a plan to lift their jerseys to reveal the #EqualPay slogan emblazoned on shirts they had been selling and were wearing underneath. Four whipped off their match shirts and were booked.\n\nThe effect was electric. \u201cIt was spontaneous,\u201d says the 16-year-old Ruby Wool. \u201cWe had scored with three minutes left, we were so excited, our crowd was excited. The ref carded us, we kind of knew that was going to come with the excessive celebration, but we hoped that our intent was appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe team have received top-down support from the school district and the high school, to match the huge wave of support from below.\n\n\u201cWhen we got our yellow cards all the crowd started chanting \u2018equal pay\u2019,\u201d Wool says. \u201cIt was the same feeling [as they felt watching the World Cup]. I mean, on a smaller scale but it had the same kind of emotion and feeling behind it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are just inspired by the way they use their platform,\u201d adds her 14-year-old teammate Lydia Sheeser. \u201cThey are obviously super well-known across the world and they take their fame and success and they put it towards helping every girl. The wage gap does not just affect girls in sports it affects every woman who has a job who\u2019s not getting paid what she deserves.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burlington train wearing #EqualPay shirts.

They are our future; we hope to be them one day. Our futuristic thinking motivated us. We\u2019re living in the now but want to make change for our future.\u201d\n\nMore than 700 shirts were sold before the game and they have continued to produce and sell them. A voluntary 16% mark-up on the price has been added for men to represent the gender pay gap in Vermont.\n\n\u201cThe reaction has been incredible,\u201d says Sheeser. \u201cFar beyond what we could have expected but we had a lot of support from our community. They\u2019ve rallied behind us, local college students have been coming to our games. Senator Patrick Leahy and his wife Marcelle bought jerseys. And recently, something that shocked us was that we had Brandi Chastain and Mia Hamm tweet about us and then Billie Jean King did. It\u2019s blown us away.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHaving raised more money than expected they are discussing what to do with it. \u201cThe money is going to partially go to providing scholarships to give young girls access to soccer and we don\u2019t just want to donate money, we want to donate our time too,\u201d Sheeser says. \u201cWe want to have mentorship programmes with them.\n\n\u201cSecret deodorant just told us that they are donating $15,000, which is the cost of 500 jerseys with an added 20% representing the national wage gap, which was amazing. With these new funds coming in we need to figure stuff out but it will be completely pointed towards helping girls access a) sports and b) trying to close the wage gap.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The yellow card that is part of the Burlington campaign. Photograph: Change the Story VT\n\nFor Jessica Nordhaus, a parent and part of Change the Story, an initiative tasked with enhancing women\u2019s economic security in the state and which has been supporting the players, the girls\u2019 action has had a huge impact. \u201cThey\u2019ve already sparked conversations not just about the wage gap but how gender impacts people across all fields,\u201d she says. \u201cIn high schools across the country the news shots are being shown in civics classes \u2013 it\u2019s really just so impressive.\n\n\u201cOne of the owners of a big tech firm here in Burlington got in a conversation about his hiring practices and whether women negotiated at the same rate men do, so we\u2019re thrilled that these conversations are happening.\u201d\n\nCould they have imagined it would take off this way? \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Wool. \u201cI mean it was a little idea we came up with at the end of practice and to think that this idea has led to this much attention, not only nationwide but internationally? We\u2019re just beyond excited. The team we played yesterday had #EqualPay, painted on their legs.\u201d\n\nThey have the small matter of a play-off quarter-final on Saturday, but their campaigning is not stopping. Looking to broaden the conversation and capitalise on the momentum, they are distributing yellow cards with shirts and have set up in the school cafeteria to encourage people to write down what cause \u201cthey would take a yellow card for\u201d and asking them to photograph themselves and use the hashtag #excessivecelebration.", "description": "Burlington players took off their jerseys to reveal #EqualPay shirts and set in motion an extraordinary sequence of events", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f285d48467112db37c99a78438dd053e81552e46/0_318_2879_1728/master/2879.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b5d78a8d54e98f5df36c35a66a32a0b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
