(DLTR) : \"This is a great growth stock and it's doing really well,\" commented Jim Cramer. Let's take a look at some charts and indicators to see if the chart is growing too.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of DLTR, below, we can see that prices have been oscillating sideways since March in a wider and wider trading range. There has been lower lows and higher highs the past seven months. This chart pattern has some of the features of a broadening pattern, which can be a continuation pattern or it can be a reversal pattern. Tricky.\n\nPrices have swung above and below the 50-day moving average line getting traders long and short and then long again and then short again. The pattern is frustrating to nearly everyone and typically the trading volume is fairly active.\n\nHere the daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is moving sideways with the price action so we (or at least I) cannot decide if we are seeing accumulation or distribution. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is well above the zero line but poised to cross to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of DLTR, below, we have a positive-looking picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line shows a longer-term uptrend and the MACD oscillator on this time frame is bullish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of DLTR, below, we can see a recent upside breakout at $114.23 and a price target of $121.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The daily chart is a coin toss but the weekly chart and the Point and Figure charts are bullish. The vote is 2 to 1.", "description": "Dollar Tree Stock Could Be Set to Break Out on the Upside...DLTR", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Dollar Tree Could Be Set To Break Out On The Upside", "Two Out Three Of The Retailer'S Charts Are Bullish.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman", "Doug Kass", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d0c8bcd4-d3d2-11e9-822b-974dc85d564d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
