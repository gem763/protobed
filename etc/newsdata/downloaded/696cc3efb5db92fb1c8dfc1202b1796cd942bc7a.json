Intelligence depends on whistleblowers being protected. So the president doing what he\u2019s doing is undermining our national security as well as endangering people who speak truth to power.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has expressed interest in finding out the identity of the whistleblower, who he has called a \u201cspy.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pelosi also said that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments earlier in the day suggesting that China look into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter as well were effectively an admission of an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cThe president has confessed to his violation of his oath of office,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
