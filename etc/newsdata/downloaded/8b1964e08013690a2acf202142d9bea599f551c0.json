The Goldman team found each one-percentage-point rise in sterling translates into a a one-percentage-point outperformance of its basket of U.K. domestic stocks relative to the FTSE 100 UKX, -0.04% .\n\nThe FTSE 100\u2019s sales exposure to the U.K. was just 26% in 2017, compared with 51% for the midcap FTSE 250 MCX, +0.24% .\n\nThere would be a broader tailwind, too. Goldman\u2019s economists say that by the end of 2020 a quarter of the cumulative GDP shortfall associated with the Brexit vote could be reversed with an agreed deal.\n\nThe FTSE 100 had a quiet end to the quarter, as it dropped 0.03% to 7424.30.\n\nOne decliner was the hospitality group Whitbread WTB, +1.86% , which dropped 5% on a Barclays downgrade to equal-weight from overweight. Calling the investment case for Whitbread WTB, +1.86% \u201cmuddled,\u201d Barclays downgraded its estimate of revenue per available room for the Premier Inn operator to a 5% decline from a 3.5% decline.\n\n\u201cNext year is fraught with uncertainty. We see RevPAR anywhere from [down 6% to up 6%] depending on the Brexit outcome with the RevPAR flow-through to EBIT [at an estimated \u20ac13 million, or about 3.5% EPS] for every 1% change,\u201d Barclays said.", "description": "Markets are pricing in an increased chance of Britain reaching a deal with the European Union to exit the region in an agreed manner by the end of the month,...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS284_johnso_ZG_20190930075443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
