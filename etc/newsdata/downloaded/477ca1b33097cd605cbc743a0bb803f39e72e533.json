Katie Hill Katherine (Katie) Lauren HillThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - GOP snags mic with impeachment protest House Ethics Committee to investigate Katie Hill allegations Freshman Democrat Katie Hill denies improper relationship with staffer MORE (Calif.) are demanding the DailyMail remove nude photos purportedly of Hill that her lawyers say were published without Hill\u2019s consent.\n\nAttorneys from the firm Perkins Coi sent the letter to DailyMail executive editor Candace Trunzo on Thursday, after the DailyMail published the photos in a story, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Hill.\n\n\u201cThis letter serves as notice that civil and criminal laws prohibit the publication of images of the character you have posted, and that our client is prepared to take all necessary means to protect her rights and to protect herself from an unprecedented, unwarranted and extraordinary offensive invasion of personal privacy,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\n\u201cWithout any prejudice to Representative Hill\u2019s rights or remedies, we demand you remove these photos from publication at once.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrunzo was not immediately available for comment in response to the request.\n\nThe lawyers also argue California law \u201cprovides a cause of action against libel\u201d over the DailyMail\u2019s claim that Hill has \u201cNazi imagery on her body in the form of a tattoo\u201d calling the allegation \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d\n\nThe DailyMail story alleged Hill had a \u201cNazi-era Iron Cross\u201d tattoo.\n\nThe news organization's story was published in the wake of allegations that Hill engaged in an improper relationship with her current legislative staffer, which she has denied. The allegations were raised in a story by the conservative publication RedState last week, citing text messages from Hill\u2019s ex-husband, Kenny Heslep.\n\nThe story also alleged Hill was engaged in a relationship with a campaign staffer. Hill admitted to a relationship with the campaign staffer in a statement late Wednesday, apologizing for the \"inappropriate\" relationship and said she would work with a House Ethics Committee investigation.\n\nHill blamed the allegations first published by RedState on her ongoing divorce from an \u201cabusive husband.\u201d\n\nHer lawyers said the images published by DailyMail \u201cperpetuate the cycle of abuse\u201d Hill endured by publishing the nude photos.\n\n\u201cKatie Hill, like many women in marriages that end in separation, endured years of emotional abuse from a now-estranged husband. After she faced an onslaught of vindictive, malicious and invasive attacks in the past week, your publication asked her this morning \u2018[i]f you wish to comment\u2019 on DailyMail.com\u2019s professed intention to distribute lewd images of her, of unknown and unverified provenance,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBy spreading these purported claims, and dehumanizing and shaming images across the globe, you have perpetuated the cycle of abuse Representative Hill has endured.\u201d", "description": "Attorneys representing freshman Democrat Rep.
