But the uncertainty over what will be called interference via replay \u2014 and what won\u2019t \u2014 persisted with a disputed ruling on a failed second-half challenge by Packers Coach Matt LaFleur.\n\nAD\n\nReplay reviews, goal-line stands help Eagles notch crucial win, 34-27\n\nThe first-half replay reversal overturned a mistaken offensive pass interference call made by the on-field officials against Eagles tight end Zach Ertz. Quarterback Carson Wentz threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Alshon Jeffery while Ertz was being called for offensive pass interference away from the play.\n\nAD\n\nMike Pereira, the former NFL officiating czar who is now a rules analyst for Fox, said immediately on the broadcast that the call shouldn\u2019t have been made, since the contact began within a yard of the line of scrimmage and such contact is permitted there. The call was overturned on review and the Eagles were given the touchdown. They did not have to challenge the call because the play was automatically reviewed as a potential scoring play.\n\nAl Riveron, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of officiating, spoke about the decision to overturn the call without offering details.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the play, it was determined that No. 86 [Ertz] did not commit a foul for offensive pass interference,\u201d Riveron said in a brief video posted by the NFL to social media. \u201cTherefore the flag was picked up and Philadelphia scores a touchdown.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe call certainly appeared to be correct.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was a call that needed to be made,\u201d Pereira said on the Fox broadcast.\n\nNo matter what the NFL does, its officiating headaches just won\u2019t go away\n\nLaFleur lost a replay challenge on a pass interference non-call less than two minutes into the third quarter. LaFleur wanted defensive pass interference called on the Eagles\u2019 Avonte Maddox on an incompletion to Packers wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling. The replay non-call on the field was allowed to stand after replay review. Pereira and Fox analyst Troy Aikman said on the broadcast they thought interference should have been called.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would have liked to see that overturned,\u201d Pereira said.\n\nRiveron said there \u201cwas no clear and obvious evidence that [Maddox] hindered the opponent.\u201d\n\nOther observers agreed with Pereira and Aikman and disagreed with Riveron, who oversees the replay reviews from the NFL\u2019s headquarters in New York.\n\nAD\n\nDungy weighed in on Twitter by writing: \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I don\u2019t understand this replay review of Pass Interference. That one on Philadelphia couldn\u2019t have been more clear[-]cut. If they\u2019re not going to reverse that one I don\u2019t see how they can reverse any call.\u201d\n\nFormer NFL referee Terry McAulay, now a rules analyst for NBC, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI have absolutely no clue as to why defensive pass interference was not created by replay on that last play.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLaFleur said during his postgame news conference: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what pass interference is any more. I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\u201d\n\nEagles Coach Doug Pederson also lost a replay challenge in the third quarter, seeking to have defensive pass interference called against the Packers. The non-call on the field was allowed to stand.\n\nThe measure making pass interference calls and non-calls reviewable by instant replay was approved by NFL owners on a one-year basis and will be up for reconsideration following this season. The owners approved the measure in March after the infamous interference non-call in the NFC title game in New Orleans in January that sent the Los Angeles Rams, rather than the Saints, to last season\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nThe Browns\u2019 slow start and a brutal schedules means they could be in trouble\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 4: Vikings and Jaguars cover thanks to their pass rushes\n\nBaker Mayfield vs. Rex Ryan might be the NFL season\u2019s most fun, unexpected battle\n\nAD", "description": "The Eagles had a first-half touchdown correctly reinstated.
