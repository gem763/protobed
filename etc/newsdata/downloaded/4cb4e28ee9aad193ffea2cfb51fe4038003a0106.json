Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer\n\nBack in 2016, home design start-up Homepolish raised $20 million in funding. This week, CEO Noa Santos told designers it\u2019s all gone. \u201cWe frankly don\u2019t have the funding left to run the business on an ongoing basis,\u201d Santos said in a video conference call on Wednesday with the company\u2019s remaining employees, according to a recording provided to Intelligencer. \u201cThe bank has the legal right to all money it is owed, which is in the millions, before any potential creditor would receive any money owed to them, that includes me.\u201d\n\nThe company laid off most of its staff and abandoned its Manhattan lease in August, the design trade publication Business of Home reported last month. In June, remaining staff were placed on an \u201cunpaid leave of absence.\u201d \u201cMany were then asked to sign contracts indicating no formal promise of backpay or a bonus,\u201d BOH also reported. (Santos told BOH he intended to offer those things, despite the contracts, if he was able to secure more funding.) On the call Wednesday, Santos said that designers will not be paid any owed earnings and customers will not be receiving refunds. Santos urged the more than 200 people on the call to \u201cthink intelligently \u2026 as opposed to jumping to legal action which could work very much against all of us.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2012 by Santos and partner Will Nathan \u2014 Nathan, a former investment banker and early BuzzFeed employee, was an early design client of Santos\u2019s \u2014 Homepolish was supposed to make for a seamless and trustworthy interior-design experience at a slightly more affordable price point than your typical design service. (Designers charged a flat $130 per hour, plus furniture commission, Santos explained to Forbes in an interview for a 2016 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list. Santos was 27 at the time.) The idea was Homepolish would act as a middleman, connecting clients with pre-vetted designers and contractors, for an undisclosed cut. Homepolish also offered clients discounts on furniture brands, including West Elm. Notable clientele, according to the Homepolish website, included Karlie Kloss, Man Repeller\u2019s Leandra Medine, and billionaire heiress Hannah Bronfman. (Bronfman and her husband are described as \u201cDJ influencers.\u201d) On Instagram, where the company now has nearly 2 million followers, Homepolish drew attention thanks to a perfectly curated feed of aesthetic #goals.\n\nIn lieu of payments designers are owed, Santos said they could cobble together a \u201cresolution\u201d from a list of three options. One: allowing designers to keep working with any clients and referrals they\u2019ve gained through Homepolish. Two: continuing to assign new clients to designers. The Homepolish website is still operating normally and Santos has not disclosed its financial state. \u201cWe get clients coming to us everyday,\u201d Santos said, telling designers they could keep \u201c100 percent of what you charge, compensating you in exchange for any financial shortfall.\u201d And three: Santos said he could promote designer\u2019s work on Homepolish\u2019s social-media channels, \u201cso you can continue to build your personal brands.\u201d Santos did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Homepolish name was tarnished in recent months, notably after Ilana Wiles, an Instagram influencer known as @MommyShorts, started posting to her 160,000 followers about her \u201cabsolutely awful home renovation experience\u201d with the company earlier in 2019. (Melanie Elturk, CEO of Haute Hijab, also shared a similar story on Instagram about using Homepolish to renovate her company\u2019s office. \u201cWe had a TERRIBLE experience with @homepolish (DO NOT USE THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES) and had to find a completely new designer (not to mention all the time and money wasted \ud83d\ude2d),\u201d she wrote in a caption.) Part of the reason Wiles and her husband went with Homepolish was the company\u2019s \u201cPeace of Mind Guarantee.\u201d Except, when the couple was unhappy with \u201cshoddy\u201d work in their apartment, they said, Homepolish did not make good on its promises.\n\n\u201cHomepolish is the ultimate exercise in Instagram vs. reality,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cEveryone who sees my photos is horrified by the work. You can see it plainly.\u201d A former employee told Intelligencer they thought the work done to Wiles\u2019s apartment was \u201cjust awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we couldn\u2019t get our issues addressed with the people we were in direct contact with, my husband went to the Homepolish office to talk to Noa directly,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cHe was told that Noa did not want to be bothered with this.\u201d She said Santos only agreed to sit down after she started posting on Instagram, later sending over a team to assess the apartment. She emailed him repeatedly over the course of several months, a correspondence that ended with an email from Santos in May saying he was \u201cnot de-prioritizing\u201d her problem. That was the last she heard from him. \u201cAll I see is a business that skims from the top so that both the designers and the customers get less,\u201d she said. Wiles says she is now paying a new designer to fix some of Homepolish\u2019s mistakes, and said they are just learning to live with the ones too expensive to pay for again. The couple ultimately decided not to sue because they felt the business would soon shutter. (Another Homepolish client went to the office after attempts to contact the company went unanswered, Wiles told Intelligencer. They discovered the office was gone.)\n\n\u201cI believe that she has a right to be upset,\u201d Santos told Business of Home in August when asked about Wiles. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think she has a right to do is use her social following to spread misinformation and lambast designers that have nothing to do with this project.\u201d (Wiles said she has never publicly named her designer.)\n\nOn Instagram, Homepolish \u201cis weirdly still acting like it\u2019s business as usual,\u201d a former employee said. It continues to moderate comments and deletes anything that might tarnish the brand or indicate internal trouble. Wiles was recently blocked by the account, though she has never commented on its posts. (Her fans, however, frequently voice their opinions on her behalf, undirected.) Santos also blocked her from his personal account. \u201cThis summer, when they were ghosting paying clients, not answering their phone and not paying some of their employees, they did a paid partnership with Goop and had the back cover of two issues of Hamptons magazine,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cJust last night, at least three comments were deleted from the Homepolish Instagram account that mentioned them going out of business. I know. I\u2019ve got the screenshots.\u201d Designers on the call also asked why Santos\u2019s husband felt it appropriate to post about the couple closing on a what appears to be a multimillion-dollar house in the Hamptons amid the company\u2019s collapse. His husband\u2019s account is now private.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of designers out there who are not in the same, established position [I am in] who put a lot of hopes into Homepolish,\u201d a former designer said, noting the one good thing to come out of Homepolish was a strong sense of community. \u201cSomebody sent an email saying they were literally laying on the ground and could not move [after Santos\u2019s announcement.]\u201d At the end of the video call with his former staff, Santos got teary talking about feeling \u201ctremendously disappointed\u201d and waxing nostalgic about what the experience had taught him. \u201cI\u2019ll remember the employees that I can call friends and the designers who allowed me to play a small part in building your careers,\u201d he said. A chat bubble popped up on the call screen. \u201cThere\u2019s no money, y\u2019all,\u201d someone wrote.", "description": "Homepolish, an interior design start-up, raised $20 million in funding in 2016.
