(Image: DC Universe)\n\nIn Titans\u2019 second season, the series is set to further explore the lives of the DC Universe\u2019s Trinity by way of their younger counterparts, who all made names for themselves by aping their elders\u2019 aesthetics and using their connections to the older heroes to strike fear into the hearts of villains.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of Dick Grey and Donna Troy in action, Conner Kent, the clone who goes on to become Superboy, has been conspicuously missing from the series so far, but it looks like that that\u2019s all about to change.\n\nIn a new clip, Conner, like his cousin Clark, seems to have made a home for himself out in the American countryside, where he and his canine pal Krypto are trying to lay low and avoid being detected by the Cadmus operatives responsible for creating them both.\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the armed operatives find the boy and his dog and appear all but ready to take them in with lethal force. But again, this is Superboy we\u2019re talking about here, meaning that the bullets the baddies are packing aren\u2019t really anything for him (or Krypto, presumably) to worry about. In fact, it\u2019s the soldiers who should be concerned for their own safety.\n\nTitans is now streaming on DC Universe in the U.S. and season two will come to Netflix Australia at a later date.", "description": "In Titans\u2019 second season, the series is set to further explore the lives of the DC Universe\u2019s Trinity by way of their younger counterparts, who all made names for themselves by aping their elders\u2019 aesthetics and using their connections to the older heroes to strike fear into the hearts of villains....", "authors": ["Hudson Hongo", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/hspmp7p90ue3yluf7dzl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
