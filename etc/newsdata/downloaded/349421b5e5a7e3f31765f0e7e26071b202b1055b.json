Photo: Courtesy of the vendors\n\nA few years ago, we talked to an expert at trend-forecasting agency WGSN about the best gifts to buy ahead of the Black Friday/Cyber Monday rush. The suggestions we received back then were so spot-on that we\u2019ve since drilled even further into that topic, talking to forecasters in various categories to find out what kids\u2019 toys and things for women, men, and tech junkies they think will sell out during the holiday season. To find out what will be the most popular gifts for stylish women this year, we spoke to Melissa Moylan, vice-president and creative director of womenswear at trend-forecasting agency Fashion Snoops; Hallie Spradlin, the accessories director at Fashion Snoops; and Sidney Morgan-Petro, a senior retail editor at WGSN. Read on for everything they say to buy the stylish woman in your life now, before it\u2019s too late.\n\nSloungewear\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about \u2018sloungewear,\u2019\u201d says Morgan-Petro, explaining that the term refers to clothes that are \u201clike a sleepwear-loungewear [hybrid] but still smart enough to run around in \u2014 you can look at it also as the evolution of athleisure.\u201d She names Aday and Lunya as examples of sloungewear brands that will be popular this season. We were very impressed when we tested Lunya\u2019s silk pajamas, and when we asked Teen Vogue fashion and beauty-features director Tahirah Hairston about her favorite white button-down shirt, she named the brand\u2019s linen set as perfect to wear when rolling out of bed and going to brunch \u2014 something that sounds very sloungewear to us.\n\nEckhaus Latta Black and Green UGG Edition Block Slide Slippers Morgan-Petro also told us to look out for what WGSN has dubbed \u201ctwo-mile wear\u201d this season. Similar to the Japanese concept of \u201cone-mile wear\u201d \u2014 comfortable clothing you would wear in a one-mile radius of your home \u2014 two-mile wear refers to lounge clothes that have a slightly more professional bent, or, as Morgan-Petro puts it, \u201cfor that person who\u2019s working from home but it\u2019s still rooted in comfort.\u201d She describes this category of clothing as something that \u201cfocuses on the comfort of home but is smart enough that you could run errands outside and go to the grocery store and wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed to run into somebody.\u201d One example would be a hybrid slipper-shoe, like one from UGG\u2019s collaboration with Eckhaus Latta. \u201cWhen they first came out, UGGs were so popular that we didn\u2019t know they\u2019d still be going so strong in 2019,\u201d says Morgan-Petro. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where if you look back at the early 2000s, with Ed Hardy and Von Dutch, UGGs are really the only ones that have evolved.\u201d $270 at SSENSE Buy\n\nCoats\n\nUniqlo Women Pile-Lined Fleece Tailored Coat \u201cIn times like these, we could all use a real-life security blanket,\u201d Moylan says. \u201cBehold the Teddy Coat.\u201d Following the popularity of Max Mara\u2019s shearling Teddy Icon coat last year, even more jackets with the soft silhouette are out there this holiday season, she explains. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot more of the Teddy this winter in popular neutrals like camel, while Max Mara\u2019s bright new colors like cerulean blue will make waves among the fashion flock.\u201d If the Max Mara is out of your budget, Moylan notes the good news is that \u201cvirtually every brand out there is doing their own take on it,\u201d including Uniqlo, whose Teddy Coat will get you in on the trend while it\u2019s still hot for a not-unreasonable $50. $50 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nMoncler Genius Narva Parka If the woman you\u2019re shopping for has a sportier style, Morgan-Petro says that \u201cpackable puffers\u201d and fashion puffers are having a moment. \u201cWith the increase in people doing more experiential gifts\u201d like trips to Iceland or Alaskan cruises, she says that packable puffers \u201cthat work with those experiences are definitely helpful.\u201d Morgan-Petro told us that brands like Moncler are considering how to make the puffer into a more fashionable silhouette, and suggests looking to Moncler\u2019s Genius line for some puffers that fit the bill. (For some more affordable options, click on over to our roundup of cool puffer coats under $180.) $2,320 at Moncler Buy\n\nLevi's Ex-Boyfriend Sherpa Trucker Jacket For something lighter-weight, Moylan suggests this Sherpa-lined denim jacket from Levi\u2019s. \u201cBecause gifting (or perhaps pulling off) mom jeans isn\u2019t easy, opt for a jean jacket instead,\u201d she says. Moylan notes that this jacket taps into the \u201990s-throwback looks that are popular with teens, and also nods to the oversized jean jackets currently sold by Balenciaga. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing oversized jean jackets trend in a big way at Balenciaga, but there\u2019s nothing quite like the original,\u201d Moylan says. \u201cLevi\u2019s ex-boyfriend style works in a relaxed silhouette with the addition of Sherpa lining for winter.\u201d $128 at Levi's Buy\n\nSustainable clothing\n\nEverlane ReCashmere Stroopwafel Turtleneck Moylan says that in addition to being extremely cozy, this turtleneck from Everlane \u201ctaps into sustainability with recycled cashmere that cuts the carbon footprint in half compared to traditional cashmere sweaters.\u201d It falls into a larger trend of \u201csweater dressing,\u201d according to Moylan, who told us that \u201cluxury brands like Loro Piana make the case for never leaving the couch with coordinated knit sets, while slightly oversized turtlenecks are intended to be worn out.\u201d $155 at Everlane Buy\n\nTheory Etienette B Good Wool Suit Jacket While \u201ctoday\u2019s power woman loves a suit,\u201d Moylan notes it\u2019s easier to gift a classic blazer, like this sleek one from Theory \u2014 which is also made with sustainability in mind. \u201cTheory\u2019s long blazer offers a flattering tailored fit without going into \u201980s-shoulder-pad territory,\u201d she told us, noting that this is made from \u201cresponsibly milled Good Wool.\u201d As for how to wear the blazer, she says \u201cit pairs well with slim or cropped pants and looks sharp layered over knits or sweaters,\u201d adding that \u201cboth jewel and soft tones are a great look for the holidays.\u201d $475 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nLingerie\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more emphasis on rebuilding these traditional women\u2019s markets that have gone stale,\u201d says Morgan-Petro. This season, she says that shift can be seen in women\u2019s lingerie. \u201cI think right now we\u2019re seeing this huge upheaval in the lingerie market,\u201d she says. \u201cOur traditional fantastical bras and panties \u2014 I won\u2019t name names \u2014 are slowly being replaced by these brands like Third Love and Heist, where the focus is on comfort and fit and customization and inclusive sizing.\u201d We\u2019ve heard good things about Heist before \u2014 comedian Jacqueline Novak had high praises for its bodysuit when we asked about her favorite things \u2014 so it\u2019s not too surprising to hear that forecasters think it\u2019ll be a popular pick.\n\nShoes and accessories\n\nA similar reimagining of comfort and utility is happening in women\u2019s shoes, according to Morgan-Petro. She names Sarah Flint\u2019s shoes as an example of an increasingly popular brand that focuses on making classic women\u2019s footwear with built-in support. \u201cThey have this really beautiful pump with a stiletto heel that is very elegant, but it has this entire footbed technology in it,\u201d says Morgan-Petro. Another example she gave us is the brand Vionic. \u201cThey actually have doctor approved orthotics in their heels,\u201d she says.\n\nStaud Mini Shirley Bag For the fashionable woman who is still without a mini bag, Spradlin suggests this one from Staud. She says it\u2019s small but functional because of its tote silhouette, which will still fit the basics, and its removable pouch and detachable strap. \u201cSnake prints and finishes are also a must-have pattern for the season, so this bag checks all the boxes,\u201d she says. $275 at Staud Buy\n\nMejuri Croissant D\u00f4me Ring Jewelry always makes an appreciated holiday gift, and if you\u2019re looking for something particularly on-trend, go for a chunkier piece like Mejuri\u2019s Croissant D\u00f4me Ring. \u201cMejuri\u2019s Dome Ring stands out as the perfect everyday statement piece,\u201d says Spradlin. \u201cThe chunky silhouette is slightly referential to the \u201980s, while still maintaining modern elevation.\u201d $65 at Mejuri Buy\n\nPaloma Wool Melange Plaza Scarf There\u2019s no holiday gift more classic than a scarf, and Moylan suggests this cozy one from Barcelona-based brand Paloma Wool for its \u201csubtle color block trim that add just a touch of whimsy to a cold-weather day.\u201d She also notes that the brand \u2014 which makes its products in a \u201crange of seasonal colors, from neutral to pop jewel tones\u201d \u2014 is offering a matching sweater, should you want to give the stylish woman in your life a complete (and toasty) knitwear look. $79 at Bona Drag Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the retailer Ganni Silk Scrunchie $15 (was $25, now 40% off) We\u2019ve written about scrunchies a couple times this year, and by now the fashionable female you\u2019re buying for probably owns at least one. But Spradlin assures us that the \u201990s-inspired hair accessory is here to stay, at least through the holiday season. She says the scrunchie to give right now is one from cool Danish brand Ganni. \u201cNot only do Ganni\u2019s come in fall\u2019s best prints and colors, but they are also made in fabrics to match some of the brand\u2019s dresses for a complete head-to-toe look,\u201d says Spradlin. We think a scrunchie would also make a perfect stocking stuffer for that \u201990s-fashion-obsessed teen on your list. $15 at Shopbop Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
