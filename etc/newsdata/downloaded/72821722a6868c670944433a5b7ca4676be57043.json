That\u2019s all it took to create a new religion \u2014 one that has sparked witch-hunts, ruined reputations and fostered a climate of suspicion that shows no signs of waning.\n\nTwo years ago, actress and producer Alyssa Milano took to Twitter and told her followers: \u2018If you\u2019ve been sexually harassed or assaulted, write \u201cme too\u201d as a reply to this tweet.\u2019\n\nA week earlier, The New York Times had printed an investigation into the then most powerful man in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein. It accused the movie mogul of being a serial sexual predator who\u2019d been paying off his accusers for decades.\n\nWeinstein resigned from his production company days later.\n\nJoanna Williams argues that the second birthday of #MeToo shouldn't be celebrated, the global movement began a week after The New York Times printed an investigation into Harvey Weinstein (pictured)\n\nBut, if it were not for Milano\u2019s tweet \u2014 from which the hashtag #MeToo was born \u2014 his fall from grace, and the ensuing legal case that prompted more accusers to come forward with shocking accusations, might have been the end of it.\n\nInstead, within a week of Milano\u2019s call to arms, #MeToo had been used 1.7 million times on social media in 85 countries.\n\nIt morphed into a global movement raising awareness of sexual harassment and inspired the Time\u2019s Up protests. Soon, its influence was felt beyond the internet and the list of victims \u2014 and the accused \u2014 grew.\n\nHousehold names such as Bill Cosby, convicted of multiple sex crimes, and Kevin Spacey, who remains under investigation, are just two of them.\n\nThis month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under scrutiny after journalist Charlotte Edwardes accused him of squeezing her thigh at a lunch 20 years ago \u2014 which he denies.\n\nLeading MeToo-ers, lauded as \u2018The Silence Breakers\u2019 on the cover of Time Magazine in 2017, boasted that, before #MeToo, women kept silent about the abuse they\u2019d suffered.\n\nWhile it is true that the movement has made it easier for women \u2014 including Hollywood stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Cara Delevingne, plus many thousands more worldwide \u2014 to speak out about sexual harassment, I firmly believe that its second birthday is not something to celebrate unquestioningly.\n\nIt may have made some men think twice before behaving like lecherous idiots, but I fear it has also had a ruinous impact on everyday relationships, undermined our centuries-old justice system and led to the suicide of a British politician.\n\nWithin days of #MeToo going global, I, along with a handful of traditional feminists, expressed concern about what the movement might become.\n\nJoanna says in the world of #MeToo, those accused of sexual harassment are seen as guilty until proven innocent. Alyssa Milano (pictured) began the movement with a tweet\n\nAfter all, it began life on Twitter, which requires users to communicate in 280 characters or fewer. That doesn\u2019t exactly lend itself to the nuanced tone required to discuss abuse.\n\nThat #MeToo brings genuine abusers to light is, of course, to be applauded.\n\nHowever, allegations soon became rumour and hearsay.\n\nAnd Twitter\u2019s group dynamic, \u2014 where users often gang up on others \u2014 ensured that often only one response was acceptable: to believe, without question or criticism, the accuser.\n\nForget about delivering justice \u2014 in the world of #MeToo, the accused are always guilty until proven innocent. That\u2019s if any attempt at relying on the law is made at all.\n\nAs we in Britain know all too well, assuming that anyone accused of sexual offences is guilty before they have been able to defend themselves can have awful consequences.\n\nIn November 2017, a month after Milano\u2019s tweet, Welsh Government minister Carl Sargeant was found dead at home. He had been accused of inappropriate conduct towards women and, after being hounded by activists without ever being told the specific details of the claims, took his own life.\n\nNo one can guess another\u2019s mental state, and we\u2019ll never know the full facts of this case. But had there not been such a climate of hysteria, it is possible that his wife, Bernadette, would still have a husband and their children, Jack and Lucy, would still have a father.\n\nJoanna recounts a series of #MeToo misdemeanours that were blown out of proportion. Kevin Spacey (pictured) is among stars still under investigation\n\nSo far, #MeToo has resulted in sex abusers being exposed, but also ruined the reputations of innocent men. It has harmed women, too.\n\nFor #MeToo activists have made their definition of \u2018sexual assault\u2019 so trivial that vulnerable victims who have suffered genuinely traumatic experiences are undermined.\n\nAt first, #MeToo focused on accusations of rape. But, as more and more women spoke out, their allegations ranged from serious criminal offences to bad behaviour.\n\nIn December 2017, Conservative MP Damian Green, who was then the Deputy Prime Minister and Theresa May\u2019s right-hand man, had his reputation damaged when journalist Kate Maltby accused him of \u2018fleetingly\u2019 touching her knee when she was a young Tory activist \u2014 a claim he has strenuously denied.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the campaign of U.S. presidential hopeful Joe Biden was almost derailed after a former politician said he made her feel \u2018uneasy, gross and confused\u2019 in 2014 when he allegedly kissed her on the back of the head.\n\nIn one of the most frivolous cases to go viral, comedian Aziz Ansari almost had his career ruined after a woman he once dated complained online she felt his pattern of behaviour was coercive.\n\nAmong her claims were that he left a restaurant too early, poured her red wine instead of white and tried to kiss her when her \u2018non-verbal cues\u2019 told him she wasn\u2019t up for it.\n\nCara Delevingne (pictured) is among female celebs to speak out about their experiences. Joanna argues that broadening the definition of sexual assault to fit #MeToo has diluted its very meaning\n\nIn hindsight, it is easy to laugh at how these #MeToo misdemeanours have been blown out of proportion. But it is also deeply concerning.\n\nFor if all these behaviours \u2014 rape, flirtation, picking the wrong bottle of wine \u2014 are thrown together under the same banner, it risks giving the appearance that serious sexual assault and knee-touching are equivalent offences.\n\nBy broadening the definition of sexual assault, #MeToo\u2019s proponents have diluted and undermined its very meaning.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that campaigners regard all victims as equal.\n\nOver the past two years, we have read a great deal about knees being touched, and you could be forgiven for thinking that sexual predators only target middle-class legs in posh London restaurants.\n\nBut this approach has the unintended impact of erasing genuine cases of gross misbehaviour, many of which are shamefully and wilfully ignored.\n\nWhen was the last time the #MeToo brigade lamented the plight of the working-class girls of Rotherham, Huddersfield and Telford \u2014 some just 11 years old \u2014 who were groomed and raped by men of Pakistani heritage?\n\nGirls were often passed between abusers. Some were made pregnant, had abortions and were raped time and again. Three women were murdered and two others died in tragedies linked to the abuse.\n\nJoanna says that there's a double standard at the heart of the #MeToo movement that fails to acknowledge women of specific backgrounds and classes. Angelina Jolie (pictured) has revealed that she experienced unwanted sexual attention\n\nOf course, the scandalous treatment of these young girls did come to light some years before #MeToo was born. But do today\u2019s campaigners really think that grooming in these areas has miraculously stopped after a handful of prosecutions?\n\nEver since care home managers in the Midlands warned of child sex rings in the Nineties, worrying new cases have continued to come to the surface.\n\nIn the spirit of #MeToo, one might expect activists to march through these areas, demanding financial support for the abused girls and their families. But the collective silence of #MeToo on this issue is a stain on the proud history of feminism.\n\nA century ago, Suffragettes, in particular Sylvia Pankhurst, put their lives on the line to fight for the rights of British women \u2014 including working-class women \u2014 to vote.\n\nBack then, the sisterhood wasn\u2019t confined to middle-class activists. It was a universal movement dedicated to serious problems.\n\nBut now, either Northern girls don\u2019t make for such sympathetic victims or Pakistani-heritage men are \u2018problematic\u2019 perpetrators. Whichever it is, there is a shameless double standard at the heart of the #MeToo movement.\n\nHow else can we explain the activists\u2019 preference for policing the workplace to confronting grooming gangs?\n\nCountless surveys over the past two years have been wheeled out to prove that sexual harassment is rife in the office.\n\nThey make for alarming reading \u2014 until we dig deeper.\n\nJoanna says fear of sexual harassment allegations has erased fun in the workplace, with some firms banning alcohol and Christmas parties. Bill Cosby (pictured) has been convicted of multiple sex crimes\n\nTake one study, commissioned by the Trades Union Congress in May this year. Entitled \u2018Sexual harassment of LGBT people in the workplace\u2019, it claims roughly 70 per cent of LGBT workers have been sexually harassed at work. It\u2019s a shocking statistic. But, if you look at the types of assault highlighted in the study, the most frequently reported form of sexual harassment was . . . a joke.\n\nFor the survey\u2019s creators, intent on shining a spotlight on sexual harassment even in places where it doesn\u2019t exist, it didn\u2019t matter if the victim was the subject of a joke or even the intended audience \u2014 they may have just overheard a quip shared, just once, many years earlier.\n\nSo now fun has been erased in the workplace. Some firms have banned alcohol from work functions, others have vetoed hugging. A handful have even cancelled office Christmas parties.\n\nWherever you venture \u2014 from your place of work to your local bar \u2014 a pungent cloud of suspicion now hangs over every interaction between a man and a woman.\n\n#MeToo\u2019s message of fear and distrust has spread into every corner of our lives. And it shows no sign of relenting.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of universities now offer students sexual consent classes, in which they are taught that sex is a good thing as long as certain rituals are observed beforehand.\n\nLessons focus on how to seek consent before a sexual encounter and how to know whether or not your partner agrees.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow (pictured) has experienced sexual harassment. Joanna says the world is becoming a place where women tremble at an unwanted male glance and men carry consent forms to protect themselves\n\nThis is an incredibly patronising development. If any student needs to be taught that rape is wrong, let alone the difference between \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019, then they certainly should not be allowed anywhere near a university.\n\nWorse, in being expected to carry out a formal negotiation process detailing in advance exactly who will do what to whom, where, when and for how long, embarking on sex becomes terrifyingly over-complicated.\n\nForget passion and spontaneity. In a world where young adults can\u2019t be left alone to work out how to get someone into bed with them, it\u2019s hardly surprising that one in eight 26-year-olds today has never had sex, compared with one in 20 a generation ago.\n\nIf today\u2019s students are tomorrow\u2019s parents, teachers and lawyers, then the university campus offers us a terrible glimpse into the future.\n\nIt\u2019s a world where men and women lead increasingly separate lives. It\u2019s a world where women tremble at an unwanted glance and men carry consent forms to protect themselves in case the police are called after a night out.\n\nIt\u2019s an unforgiving place where men are tried and found guilty after one mistake, or one imagined mistake; where relationships between men and women, once the bedrock of families and communities, are no longer forged from love and trust, but fear.\n\nTwo years is more than enough: we need to call time on #MeToo.\n\nDr Joanna Williams is the author of Women Vs Feminism: Why We All Need Liberating From The Gender Wars.\n\nPodcast pick\n\nAlice Liveing (pictured) speaks to leading sportswomen on her podcast, Give Me Strength\n\nGive me strength with Alice Liveing\n\nPersonal trainer and author Alice Liveing asks leading sportswomen what they believe makes a person \u2018strong\u2019 \u2014 whether that\u2019s mental health, physical fitness or resilience.\n\nHeptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill recalls training while pregnant, Dame Kelly Holmes tells how her wins came at her lowest ebb and TV presenter Gabby Logan argues for more coverage of women\u2019s events.\n\nThe podcast is a must for anyone interested in fitness, mental health and the power of sport.\n\nhttps://player.fm/series/give- me-strength-with-alice-liveing", "description": "Joanna Williams who is the author of Women Vs Feminism, argues that the birthday of #MeToo  shouldn't be celebrated.
