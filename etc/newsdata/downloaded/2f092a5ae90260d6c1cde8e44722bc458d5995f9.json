Her last known communication was with a friend on Wednesday, just before midnight. Blanchard is a student at Southern Union State Community College in Alabama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAngela Haley-Harris, Blanchard\u2019s mother, told WBRC, a Fox affiliate television station in Alabama, last week that her daughter\u2019s roommate and Blanchard exchanged messages Wednesday. Blanchard told her roommate she was out with a man, according to Angela Haley-Harris.\n\nHaley-Harris also said Blanchard\u2019s debit card was last used at about 11:20 p.m. Wednesday and that, according to police, her phone \u201cwent dark\u201d just before midnight.\n\nPLEASE HELP FIND MY COUSIN!

It does not feel real for a human being to be talked to one minute and vanish the next.\u201d\n\nPolice said Blanchard\u2019s vehicle, a 2017 Honda CRV, was discovered in Montgomery, Ala., on Friday evening. It had damage on the passenger\u2019s side that wasn\u2019t there when the SUV was last spotted in Auburn late Wednesday night, according to authorities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking maybe a carjacking because the car was torn up,\u201d Blanchard\u2019s stepmother, Yashiba Blanchard, said Monday. \u201cBut the police haven\u2019t said that, either. They\u2019re trying to match up the evidence.\u201d\n\nA friend of Blanchard\u2019s, Summer Whatley, told ABC News that it was \u201ccompletely out of character\u201d for her to go missing. Blanchard\u2019s mother offered a similar assessment last week, telling WBRC that falling out of contact was \u201cdefinitely not Aniah.\u201d\n\nAniah is STILL MISSING!!!\n\nShe has been missing from Auburn, AL for almost a week now. We do not know if she met up with someone on a dating app or not. Her vehicle was spotted in Montgomery on Friday with damage.
