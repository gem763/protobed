Once the hold ends, it expects to initially resume about 20 flights per day, gradually returning the plane to full commercial service over the rest of the month.\n\nThe FAA said Wednesday that it is \u201cfollowing a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 MAX to passenger service. The FAA will lift the aircraft\u2019s prohibition order when it is deemed safe to do so,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nThe plane has been grounded since mid-March in the wake of two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that collectively killed nearly 350 people. Southwest Airlines has canceled flights through Jan. 5, while United Airlines has suspended them through Dec. 19.\n\nThe announcement comes two days after the union representing Southwest pilots sued Boeing, saying the company \u201cdeliberately misled\u201d the pilots and airline about the model and that pilots have lost over $100 million in wages while the airline had grounded its fleet.", "description": "American Airlines will continue to ground Boeing 737 Max\u00a0airplanes into January 2020 amid regulatory reviews of the plane model,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/floridaboeing737plane_050419ntsbtwitter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
