We can take a serious step towards reducing the harm this is causing our young women and girls by looking at our language - and this starts with the dictionary,\u201d Ms. Giovanardi said.\n\n\u201cThis sexist dictionary must change, she added. \u201cThese examples show women as sex objects, subordinate, and/or an irritation to men.\u201d\n\nMs. Giovanardi also notes there are 25 different examples in the dictionary for the \u201cmen\u201d entry while there are only five for the \u201cwomen\u201d one.\n\nThe petition calls for OUP to \u201cEliminate all phrases and definitions that discriminate against and patronise women and/or connote men\u2019s ownership of women; Enlarge the dictionary\u2019s entry for \u2018woman\u2019; Include examples representative of minorities, for example, a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, etc.\u201d\n\nKatherine Connor Martin, OUP\u2019s head of lexical content strategy, said in a statement editors are investigating \u201cwhether there are senses of woman which are not currently covered but should be added in a future update,\u201d but added that the examples in the petition come from the Oxford\u2019s Thesaurus of English and the Oxford dictionary of English, not the scholarly Oxford English Dictionary.\n\n\u201cIf there is evidence of an offensive or derogatory word or meaning being widely used in English, it will not be excluded from the dictionary solely on the grounds that it is offensive or derogatory,\u201d Ms. Martin said.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, part of the descriptive process is to make a word\u2019s offensive status clear in the dictionary\u2019s treatment. For instance, the phrase the little woman is defined as \u2018a condescending way of referring to one\u2019s wife\u2019, and the use of \u2018bit\u2019 as a synonym for woman is labelled as \u2018derogatory\u2019 in the thesaurus,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Ms. Martin said \u201csensibilities regarding language are constantly changing\u201d and she appreciates feedback for updates on classifying words considered derogatory,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe current cultural moment has seen an increasing acknowledgment of the real-life impact that words can have on individuals and groups. As this awareness leads to changes in linguistic behaviour, the dictionary will seek to record them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe OUP also confirmed they are \u201ctaking the points raised in the petition very seriously \u2026 As ever, our dictionaries strive to reflect, rather than dictate, language so any changes will be made on that basis.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
