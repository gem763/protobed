(AP) - Two former Anaconda High School basketball players have been sentenced for raping a 14-year-old girl while the team was in Hamilton for a tournament in February 2017.\n\nThe players, who were 17 when they were charged, pleaded guilty in juvenile court to sexual intercourse without consent.\n\nThe Ravalli Republic reports one of the defendants was sentenced on Oct. 17 to three days in jail and adult supervision until he turns 23.\n\nThe other was previously sentenced to 14 days in jail followed by juvenile probation until he is 25. If he violates the terms of his juvenile sentence, he would be given a 5-year term with the Department of Corrections as an adult.\n\nRavalli County Attorney Bill Fulbright says if the teens meet the terms of their probation, their juvenile records can be sealed.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Ravalli Republic , http://www.ravallirepublic.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two former Anaconda High School basketball players have been sentenced for raping a 14-year-old girl while the team was in Hamilton for a tournament in February 2017.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
