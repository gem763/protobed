It\u2019s actually worse than that.", "language": "en", "text": "This is not to say there aren\u2019t crimes on the books that better match what Trump is alleged to have done. For instance, it is a campaign finance crime to knowingly and willfully solicit a campaign contribution from a foreign national. Given that Biden could be Trump\u2019s next political opponent, an argument can be made that the Ukrainian investigation would be an in-kind contribution (a \u201cthing of value,\u201d as defined by the statute) to Trump\u2019s campaign. The bribery of a foreign official like the Ukrainian president can also be a criminal violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nBut both of these statutes contain at least some of the problems presented by the bribery and extortion statutes. Courts won\u2019t send presidents to prison for cajoling foreign governments to do things, even if that involves horse trading an official act by our government in exchange for an official act by someone else\u2019s.\n\nWhat Trump is alleged to have done is not a garden variety crime; it\u2019s worse. It involved misusing $250 million in aid appropriated by Congress for his benefit\u2014the kind of gross misconduct that easily clears the bar of high crimes and misdemeanors set by the Constitution when impeaching a president. Which means the best way to hold Trump accountable for that misconduct isn\u2019t a criminal trial; it\u2019s for Congress to impeach him.", "description": "", "authors": ["Renato Mariotti", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
