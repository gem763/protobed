Biden on a golf outing with his son Hunter and his son\u2019s business partner in a Ukraine venture has cast doubts upon the former vice president\u2019s claim that his family never discussed their business deals.\n\nThe claim is Mr. Biden\u2019s chief pushback against allegations that as vice president he intervened in Kyiv to block a 2016 corruption probe of Ukraine natural gas company Burisma Holdings where Hunter Biden had a job on the board of directors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters last month on the campaign trail in Iowa.\n\nThe corruption charge also is at the heart of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry regarding President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call in which he pressured the Ukraine president to open an investigation of the Bidens\u2019 activities in the country.\n\nThe 2014 photograph shows a golf foursome that includes Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, a colleague of Hunter Biden who also served on the board at Burisma.\n\nThat was the same year the elder Mr. Biden became the Obama administration\u2019s point man in Ukraine and Hunter Biden and Mr. Archer scored high-paying gigs at Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden, a Yale-educated lawyer with no experience in the energy industry, was paid $50,000 a month.\n\nThe photograph did not confirm that Mr. Biden and his son discussed Burisma or any other of the business deals involving Hunter Biden and Mr. Archer. But it did highlight the close relationship of the three men at the time of the Ukraine deal and raise questions about what they discussed.\n\nThe Biden campaign refused to comment on the photograph.\n\nThe allegations of corruption Mr. Trump has leveled against Mr. Biden are similar to those House Democrats are pursuing against Mr. Trump in an impeachment inquiry. Both involve abuse of political power for personal gain.\n\nMr. Trump is accused of prodding the Ukrainian president to investigate a political rival. Mr. Biden is accused of prodding Kyiv to stop an investigation involving his son\u2019s employer.\n\nDuring a 2016 visit as vice president to Kyiv, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if the country\u2019s leaders did not fire Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, who was accused of not doing enough to fight rampant corruption.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s office also was investigating money laundering and fraud at Burisma.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have seized on the photo, which was first reported by Fox News, as evidence that Mr. Biden knows more than he lets on about his son\u2019s sweetheart deals in Ukraine and business ventures around the globe that appeared to cash in on his father\u2019s political clout.\n\nMr. Trump posted a video on Twitter that featured a clip of Mr. Biden saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d The video then cuts to a popular meme of the music video for the 2005 Nickelback single \u201cPhotograph,\u201d with the golf photo inserted in the starring role.\n\nIn the original video, vocalist Chad Kroeger holds up a framed photographed and sings:\n\n\u201cLook at this photograph / Every time I do it makes me laugh / How did our eyes get so red? / And what the hell is on Joey\u2019s head?\u201d\n\nThe meme involves people digitally inserting other photographs into the frame.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s version inserted the golf photo with the words \u201cUkraine gas exec\u201d superimposed on Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden and his son labeled with their names.\n\nThe outlines of red hearts are then drawn around the faces of the three men in the photo.\n\nTwitter removed the video within 12 hours, citing a complaint by Nickleback that it infringed on the copyright.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, later tweeted the same video.\n\n\u201cIf this is true, that Biden didn\u2019t know about his son\u2019s overseas business dealings, then where else was the son doing business that was in conflict with the best interest of the United States? Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, etc? Of course, it\u2019s a lie. They must think we\u2019re stupid,\u201d tweeted Mr. Giuliani.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
