That's right, newly promoted Granada, whose entire squad cost just \u00a38million, are currently at the pinnacle of Spanish football.\n\nOf course, Real Madrid and Barcelona, who each have a game in hand after the farce surrounding their El Clasico match last week, will have something to say about that as we head into matchday 11.\n\nReal Madrid have actually fallen to sixth place in the table after their off-week, showing just how tight it is at the top. Three points separate the top seven, with four of them on 19 points after 10 games.\n\nNewly promoted Granada are the unlikely team on top of La Liga after 10 matches played\n\nReal Madrid have slipped down the table thanks to the postponement of their Barcelona match\n\nWith 10 matches to choose from, Sportsmail is going to run you through the main talking points from this week's La Liga action.\n\nOn paper, there appear to be quite a few one-sided games coming up. Top teams are going against bottom teams in what should be simple tests to solidify their position in the league.\n\nHowever, given the way the season started, it seems likely there will be a few more upsets this week.\n\nAlaves vs Atletico Madrid, Tuesday 6pm\n\nLA LIGA MIDWEEK FIXTURES Tuesday: Alaves vs Atletico Madrid - 6pm Barcelona vs Valladolid - 8:15pm Wednesday: Valencia vs Sevilla - 6pm Real Sociedad vs Levante - 6pm Athletic Bilbao vs Espanyol - 7pm Real Betis vs Celta Vigo - 8pm Real Madrid vs Leganes - 8:15pm Thursday: Eibar vs Villareal - 6pm RCD Mallorca vs Osasuna - 6pm Getafe vs Granada - 8:15pm\n\nAlaves and Atletico Madrid will be kicking off the midweek action on Tuesday at 6pm.\n\n\u00a3114million star Joao Felix is still out of action after being sidelined thanks to an ankle knock he picked up during the draw with Valencia a couple of weeks ago. He'll still be out for another week or so, adding to Atletico's problems up front.\n\nThey've only scored 10 goals this season, well off the pace set by the other front runners, but they are sitting pretty in a Champions League space thanks to their staunch defence.\n\nThey've only let in five all season, and given Alaves have only managed to score eight, without really having played any of the top teams yet, it's probably going to be a struggle for them.\n\nAtletico are reportedly in the race to sign Brescia star Sandro Tonali, alongside PSG, Man City, and Man United, although they may have to use all of the money they received for Antoine Griezmann over the summer. The Italian club's president believes his man is worth an incredible \u00a3260million.\n\nAtletico's big money man Joao Felix has an ankle injury and is likely to miss the match\n\nBarcelona vs Valladolid, Tuesday 8:15pm\n\nBarcelona are up against Valladolid on Tuesday, who are having a steady season, currently sitting in ninth place.\n\nThe Catalans will be eyeing a return to the top of the table, although the places at the top may appear out of line for the next several weeks until Barca and Real play their extra game.\n\nYou'd expect Barcelona to win here, but Valladolid are actually unbeaten in their last six. You have to go back over a month for their last loss, which came at the hands of Villareal.\n\nSamuel Umtiti has struggled with a recurring knee injury for a long time now, and is likely to miss the match after being absent from training.\n\nBarcelona will be looking to get back on top of La Liga after last week's El Clasico farce\n\nBarcelona still have a wealth of talent at their disposal though, so Valladolid's good defensive record could be under threat from Messi and co. The Argentine should be back to full fitness after injury, and Barcelona have already scored 23 goals this season.\n\nWhat all their star power does mean is that even some of the best players around scarcely get a look in. Out of favour Ivan Rakitic could be on the way out, as Manchester United, Juventus, and Inter Milan are all keen for his services.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged Carlos Vela was 'really close' to signing for Barcelona last season, and is apparently still targeting a move to the Nou Camp to play alongside Lionel Messi when his time in the MLS comes to an end. He just broke the record for most goals in an MLS season with 34 so far for Los Angeles FC, so he's certainly still got it.\n\nValencia vs Sevilla, Wednesday 6pm\n\nValencia, who finished fourth in La Liga last year and won the Spanish Cup, have struggled so far this season.\n\nThey lost to Osasuna last time out, and have somehow managed to get a red card in each of their last three matches, including one against Lille in the Europa League last week.\n\nBeyond their disciplinary record, Valenica's main problem is their leaky back line. They've got the second worst defensive record in the league, having conceded 16 goals across their first 10 games.\n\nValencia have something of a disciplinary issue on their hands, with three red cards in three\n\nMeanwhile, Sevilla have joined the race with Manchester United to sign Juventus outcast Mario Mandzukic in the January transfer window. A week or so ago, the Croatian skipped training with his team-mates amid the interest.\n\nJulen Lopetegui's men have been chugging along fine this season, sitting in fifth place despite not scoring a huge number of goals. They'll be looking to get some new options in soon to increase their output.\n\nReal Madrid vs Leganes, Wednesday 8:15pm\n\nThe rescheduled match against Barcelona was not the only drama Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has had to deal with this week, as he has been told by club president Florentino Perez that they won't be making moves for high priority targets Paul Pogba or Christian Eriksen in January.\n\nPerez wants more out of Zidane's current squad, especially considering they went on a \u00a3300million spending spree just a few months ago.\n\nZinedine Zidane has had a dramatic week, but will be looking for a simple win over Leganes\n\nAs for the coming week, his star-studded squad should really get the better of Leganes, who still sit bottom of the table despite picking up their first win of the season over Mallorca at the weekend.\n\nGareth Bale had been getting a bit more game time this season, despite the apparent animosity between him and his manager. However, he picked up yet another injury while on Wales duty recently.\n\nNo wonder he's been nicknamed 'The Glass.' The Welshman is leading the charge in Spain for players to have more privacy surrounding their medical information, as it's currently common policy for clubs to release a statement whenever a player gets injured.\n\nGetafe vs Granada, Thursday 8:15pm\n\nGranada, the plucky underdogs who are quickly becoming the story of the 2019-20 season, travel to Getafe on Thursday to see if they can keep their spot at the top of the league.\n\nThey've scored more goals than Real Madrid, and conceded the same number as Barcelona (and they beat the Catalans), so it's not like they're at the top through sheer luck.\n\nGranada's success is quickly becoming the story of the season, but how long can it continue?\n\nIf their current form is indicative, Getafe should be a very winnable game for them. They lost last time out against Sevilla and are currently in 11th.\n\nAll eyes will be on this game, the final one of the gameweek, to see if Granada's wild ride continues.\n\nThe bubble has to burst at some point soon, surely?\n\nPS\n\nAs for the rest of the league, Real Sociedad are currently in the unfamiliar position of third after a few seasons of being consigned to mid-table finishes. They're up against 13th placed Levante on Wednesday at 6pm as they look to try and hold on to their Champions League qualification spot.\n\nAthletic Bilbao are playing strugglers Espanyol on Wednesday at 7pm. Bilbao will look to use this match to propel themselves up the table, as they're currently slightly off the pace.\n\nReal Betis face off against Celta Vigo in a bottom of the table clash at 8pm on Wednesday. Both teams need a win to kick start their season, and this will be an important match.\n\nEibar will play Villareal in an intriguing test for the visitors, and Mallorca are against Osasuna as they look to pull clear of the relegation zone. Both of those matches kick off on Thursday at 6pm.", "description": "LA LIGA WEEKDAY PREVIEW: Granada find themselves at the top of La Liga, while Real Madrid and Barcelona are back in action after their match was postponed last week.", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/13/20281812-0-image-a-17_1572270798181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
