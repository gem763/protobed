That was really nice of them, but I feel just mostly stunned right now, I just can\u2019t believe we did it.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She did manage to eat some M&M chocolates.\n\n\u201cHopefully I can sleep the rest of the day. I\u2019m pretty out of it and pretty tired right now, for sure,\u201d she said.\n\nReuters", "description": "A US endurance swimmer has become the first person to swim across the English Channel four times without stopping.\u00a0 Sarah Thomas\u00a0refuelled only on\u00a0a liquid formula during the 54-hour swim.\u00a0 The 37-year-old woman from Colorado performed her record-breaking swim a year after receiving treatment for breast cancer, dedicating\u00a0her achievement to fellow cancer survivors.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/10/sarah-thomas-english-channel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
