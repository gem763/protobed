She said that she had been told by the deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, that even though she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d Trump had been pushing for her departure for months.\n\nYovanovitch, a career diplomat who has served as ambassador under three presidents to three countries, defied a state department instruction not to speak to impeachment investigators. Her decision to appear could trigger a wave of testimony by disaffected officials and the collapse of the administration\u2019s efforts to silence them.\n\nAs she was speaking, reports emerged that more whistleblowers were coming forward in the growing scandal over Trump\u2019s efforts to persuade foreign leaders to deliver compromising information about his political rivals.\n\nThe national security council\u2019s former senior director for Europe and Russia, Fiona Hill, is due to speak to the House committees on Monday. The current ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who is also at the centre of the impeachment row over Trump\u2019s conduct towards Ukraine, has said he will appear on Thursday, also in defiance of the state department gag.\n\nIn her written deposition to Congress, Yovanovitch gave a description of the events surrounding her surprise removal from her post in Kyiv, weeks after having been told in March that the state department wanted her to extend her posting till 2020.\n\n\u201cI was then abruptly told in late April to come back to Washington from Ukraine \u2018on the next plane\u2019,\u201d Yovanovitch wrote. \u201cYou will understandably want to ask why my posting ended so suddenly. I wanted to learn that too, and I tried to find out. I met with the deputy secretary of state who informed me of the curtailment of my term. He said that the president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch said the deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, \u201cadded that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause,\u201d Yovanovitch said.\n\n\u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the US government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nThe former ambassador, who since her removal has been on academic sabbatical at Georgetown University, went on to talk more generally about the crisis of morale at the state department. She said: \u201cI have served this nation honorably for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cWe repeatedly uproot our lives, and we frequently put ourselves in harm\u2019s way to serve this nation. And we do that willingly, because we believe in America and its special role in the world. We also believe that, in return, our government will have our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign interests,\u201d she said.\n\nUkraine texts show how Trump has warped the state department Read more\n\n\u201cThat basic understanding no longer holds true. Today, we see the state department attacked and hollowed out from within.\u201d\n\nTrump is being investigated for abusing his office, to force the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Trump\u2019s political opponent, former vice-president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nThe drive to collect compromising material was led by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and according to former officials, one of the reasons Yovanovitch was dismissed was because she refused to help Giuliani to collect information outside official channels. Giuliani has since been one of her fiercest critics.\n\nThe former ambassador said she could only recall contact with Giuliani on three occasions, none of which had anything to do with the matters under investigation.\n\n\u201cI do not know Mr Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me. But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo of Giuliani\u2019s associates, who had been helping him find material on the Bidens, were arrested on Wednesday night on election financing charges. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were indicted for conspiracy, and making false statements in a scheme to funnel foreign money into Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s damning testimony is a further sign of the deepening damage the Ukraine scandal is having on the functioning of the administration.\n\nOn Friday, Michael McKinley, one of secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s senior advisers, resigned, reportedly because of disillusion over Yovanovitch\u2019s treatment.\n\nThe state department has not responded to any press queries about Ukraine in recent days, and Pompeo has avoided the media, and Washington. On Friday, with the Turkey\u2019s Syria invasion in full force, and the Ukraine issue dominating the news, the secretary of state, who is thought to have ambitions of a Senate run, was in Nashville, Tennessee, talking to Christian ministers about mental health.", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch defies White House to speak to committees investigating Trump and says state department being \u2018hollowed out from within\u2019", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f88d62efef6365992ff03da3a6cf7ce01d87991a/0_136_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5be9ce63e9f10ceeed8ca8668578a72b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
