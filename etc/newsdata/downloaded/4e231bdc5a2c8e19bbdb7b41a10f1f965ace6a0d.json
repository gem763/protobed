It comes with the territory when you\u2019re 5-foot-11, 248 pounds, and your job requires you to lower your head and intentionally run full speed into opposing defenders who are either bigger or faster or both.\n\nIt\u2019s a gig the Pittsburgh Steelers fullback attacks with a menacing glee. He brings energy to the huddle, mostly because his presence typically means one thing: The Steelers are going to line up in a power formation, fire out and go.\n\n\u201cNot many guys want to do that role,\u201d guard David DeCastro said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty role.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh desperately needed Nix for that filthy work when he returned from a knee injury that sidelined him for six weeks. Finally healthy on Monday night against Miami, Nix provided the Steelers\u2018 running game with a jolt in a 27-14 victory that gave them their first winning streak in 11 months. Pittsburgh ran for a season-high 158 yards - the overwhelming majority on plays where Nix paved the way for James Conner - and spent the final three quarters pushing the winless Dolphins around.\n\nIt was a throwback performance. The Steelers (3-4) might need it to be repeatable if they want to entertain any shot at staying in playoff contention in the jumbled AFC.\n\n\u201cWe got back to what we\u2019ve been best at doing, just kind of power football,\u201d right tackle Matt Feiler said. \u201cWe wanted to get Rosie back in and back comfortable since he\u2019d missed some time.\u201d\n\nThe offense has certainly missed him. Pittsburgh had grown increasingly reliant on the shotgun in recent years, and when Mason Rudolph took over at quarterback for the injured Ben Roethlisberger in Week 2, the Steelers turned to it almost exclusively to help ensure Rudolph - who never took a direct snap from center in four years while running the Air Raid offense at Oklahoma State - was comfortable.\n\nThat comfort, however, also limited what the Steelers could do on the ground. Defenses crowded the line of scrimmage, daring the inexperienced Rudolph to throw. Conner - a Pro Bowler for the first time last season after taking over for Le\u2019Veon Bell - found little room to move. The only consistent success Pittsburgh had running the ball over the first six games came against Cincinnati on Sept. 30, when they relied heavily on the Wildcat formation.\n\nThat changed against Miami. On Pittsburgh\u2019s second possession, Rudolph lined up under center with Conner behind him and Nix as the upback. Rudolph turned to his left and handed the ball to Conner going up the middle. A textbook block by Nix gave Conner enough room to dash 25 yards, his second-longest carry of the season.\n\nIt set the tone on a night Conner ran for 23 times for 145 yards and a touchdown, his first 100-yard performance in 12 games. Eighteen of those carries came with Rudolph in front of Conner instead of next to him and with Nix and reserve lineman Zach Banner on the field to provide some extra heft.\n\n\u201cRosie\u2019s presence is significant, not only in terms of what he\u2019s capable of doing, but the energy it brings the other guys because they worked with him in the past,\u201d coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cSo, he has that emotional bank account with the guys. When they see him, they know what it means.\u201d\n\nDoing it against the reeling Dolphins is one thing. Doing it against AFC South-leading Indianapolis (5-2) on Sunday - and with Conner\u2019s status uncertain while he deals with a shoulder injury - is another. Such is the state of Pittsburgh\u2019s fragile running back picture that Samuels - who hasn\u2019t played in a month after getting hurt against Baltimore on Oct. 6 - will likely be the starter if Conner can\u2019t go, with former practice squad player Trey Edmunds in the mix behind Samuels. The Steelers also signed former University of Pittsburgh running back Darrin Hall to the practice squad on Wednesday for depth.\n\nSamuels has been a feature back just once in his brief career, when he racked up 172 total yards in a victory over New England last December. He says he\u2019ll be ready if he finds himself on the field with Nix.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cWe run the ball. We\u2019re the Pittsburgh Steelers. We\u2019re physical. We got the big guys up front to do it, so why not?\u201d\n\nNOTES: Conner, RB Benny Snell Jr. (knee), C Maurkice Pouncey (calf), G Ramon Foster (concussion), TE Vance McDonald (not injury related) and DT Dan McCullers (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. \u2026 LB Anthony Chickillo was at the team\u2019s facility after misdemeanor charges against him stemming from an incident at a western Pennsylvania resort were dropped. Chickillo remains on the exempt list.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's a brutal quality to the brand of football Rosie Nix plays.
