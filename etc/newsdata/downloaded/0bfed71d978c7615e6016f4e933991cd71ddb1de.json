USA TODAY\n\nCincinnati Bengals rookie quarterback Ryan Finley is replacing long-time starter Andy Dalton after an 0-8 start to the 2019 season, and is expected to see his first National Football League action when the Bengals return from their upcoming bye week to face the Baltimore Ravens at Paul Brown Stadium on Nov. 10.\n\nHere are five things to know about Finley:\n\n1. The Bengals traded up six spots - giving up a pair of sixth-round picks - to select Finley in the fourth round \u2014 104th overall \u2014 of the 2019 NFL Draft. It was the earliest the Bengals had drafted a quarterback since they took Dalton in the second round in 2011. But offensive coordinator Brian Callahan insisted a short time later that Dalton was the Bengals' quarterback, and that would not change at all with the addition of Finley.\n\nCincinnati Bengals quarterback Ryan Finley (5) prepares to hike the ball in the third quarter of the NFL preseason game between Cincinnati Bengals and New York Giants at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati on Thursday, Aug. 22, 2019.

Goff played for Zac Taylor when Taylor was the Rams' quarterbacks coach before Taylor left to become the Bengals' head coach earlier this year.\n\n3. Finley impressed at North Carolina State with his accuracy. Some scouts explained that he dropped to the fourth round in the draft because of concerns about his arm strength. As a senior, he completed 67.4 percent of his passes for 3,928 yards with 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions and was a first-team All-ACC selection.\n\n4. Finley is in his first year in the NFL, but he turns 25 in December. He started at Boise State University and redshirted once there before transferring to N.C. State and redshirting as a junior.\n\n5. Finley might not run much, maybe even less than Dalton. As a senior for the Wolfpack, Finley rushed 42 times for just 21 yards and a touchdown.", "description": "The Bengals traded up six spots \u2014 giving up a pair of sixth-round picks \u2014 to select Ryan Finley in the fourth round.", "authors": ["Dave Clark", "Published P.M.
