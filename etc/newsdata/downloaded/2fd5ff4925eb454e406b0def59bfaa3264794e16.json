Less than 20% of small and medium-sized UK businesses have so far prepared for French customs.\n\nThe report acknowledges that the government has announced temporary arrangements for managing trade crossing the land border from Ireland to Northern Ireland, but says these are \u201cnot likely to be sustainable because there is still uncertainty about border arrangements that the Irish government would introduce\u201d.\n\nThe report also discloses how civil service resources have been sucked into Brexit preparations. There were around 17,000 staff in EU exit roles, auditors said. The government plans to have around 25,000 staff in EU exit-related roles by 31 October and a total of around 27,500 by March 2020.\n\nAbout 2,000 staff will be redeployed from Whitehall departments into other roles. In some cases, departments are recruiting further staff for 31 October, the report says. Since April, the government has recruited 500 more Border Force employees to carry out transit checks.\n\nMeg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said the report showed that the government was not prepared for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt confirms that many traders and businesses will not be ready for new customs and regulatory controls and that organised criminals and others could exploit gaps,\u201d she said. \u201cIssues around the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remain unresolved.\n\n\u201cMitigating the risks could be outside of government\u2019s control; I hope all my fellow parliamentarians read this report carefully.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are doing all that is necessary to ensure that, if we do leave without a deal, the transition will be as smooth as possible for people and businesses \u2013 which the NAO recognises. This includes simplifying import processes, upgrading IT systems, securing additional freight capacity and putting traffic management plans in place around our busiest ports.\n\n\u201cMany of the challenges that we may face if the UK leaves the EU without a deal require businesses and citizens to take action. That\u2019s why we are running the largest communications campaign in recent UK history.\u201d\n\nHMRC announced on Tuesday that it had automatically enrolled a further 95,000 of those who are VAT registered to the transitional simplified procedures.", "description": "Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog report concludes UK faces significant, unpredictable risks", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8969b952e081415b3433301de3d561d058a3b4de/0_66_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03f74795d0f4c52d2a23ca1ba09e8d15", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
