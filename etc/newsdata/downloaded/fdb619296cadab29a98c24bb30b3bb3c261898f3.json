Success, however, arrives without much fanfare.\n\nPublic defender Shelly Tomtschik was in court when she got the email notifying her that the quest was over:\n\n\u201cCongratulations! After final review of your Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) application and payment history, we have determined that you have successfully made the required 120 monthly payments in order to have the loans listed below forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hitting me,\u201d says Tomtschik, 40, of Baldwin, Wisconsin. \u201cI thought it would be more official or something.\u201d\n\nTomtschik is among the first federal student loan borrowers to get their loans canceled tax-free through the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The program, launched in 2007, forgives any outstanding balance after 120 qualifying payments for borrowers who take traditionally lower-paying public service jobs.\n\nRelated: How wiping out $1.5 trillion in student debt would boost the economy\n\nBut the process is tricky. Just 864 of the 88,006 applications filed had been approved as of March 2019, based on the most recently available data from the Education Department. The average amount forgiven: $59,244.\n\nWhat it takes to get public student loan forgiveness\n\nTo qualify for PSLF, borrowers must make 120 monthly, on-time payments while working full time in public service for a qualifying employer. You also must:\n\nEnsure you have only federal direct loans. Some borrowers will need to consolidate into a direct loan. Private loans aren\u2019t eligible.\n\nEnroll in an income-driven repayment plan. Your payments will be a portion of your discretionary income.\n\nMake sure your loans are serviced by FedLoan Servicing, the only company that processes PSLF applications. You can do this by submitting an employer certification form.\n\nSubmit employer certification forms to prove you worked for a qualifying government or nonprofit employer while making all 120 payments.\n\nApply while you\u2019re still working for an eligible employer.\n\nTomtschik and another successful applicant, Bonnie Svitavsky, a librarian in Washington state, might add another requirement: Document everything.\n\nSvitavsky, a 38-year-old supervising librarian at Pierce County Library, made payments for two years before she found they wouldn\u2019t count toward PSLF. That\u2019s because her loans weren\u2019t enrolled in an eligible repayment plan.\n\n\u201cIt was disappointing, to say the least,\u201d she says.\n\nTo avoid any future surprises, Svitavsky set alarms to submit certification forms and logged the details of calls to FedLoan.\n\n\u201cIt felt crazy, but it was useful to go back and see I\u2019ve had these conversations,\u201d she says.\n\nFor five years Tomtschik didn\u2019t submit employment certification forms, though she got credit for most of her payments. But once she started, she realized the benefit: ensuring every payment would count.\n\n\u201cMake sure you do the annual certification so if there\u2019s any discrepancy in the number of payments eligible that you address it right away rather than try to go back,\u201d Tomtschik says.\n\nMore than half of PSLF applications were rejected because they did not meet the number of qualifying payments, according to the Education Department. Some of the other reasons include missing information (25%), ineligible loans (16%), invalid employment dates (2%) or an ineligible employer (2%).\n\nRead the rules \u2014 all of them\n\nTomtschik and Svitavsky could make a good argument for another requirement: Pay attention to the details.\n\nBefore submitting her first employment certification form, Tomtschik made extra payments up to $800 to pay down $70,000 in debt. \u201cI was willing to do whatever just to be done with it,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso read: Where the 2020 candidates stand on student debt and college affordability\n\nBut making more payments won\u2019t help you reach 120 qualifying payments faster. Once Tomtschik started working toward PSLF, she stopped sending additional payments.\n\nWhen Svitavsky learned about a new program \u2013 Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness \u2013 she realized forgiveness could come sooner than she thought. It\u2019s a $350 million allocation for borrowers who met all of the criteria for PSLF but were making payments under the wrong plan.\n\nThis meant the two years of payments that hadn\u2019t counted toward Svitavsky\u2019s forgiveness now could. Last fall she applied, was denied and had to contact FedLoan to say she believed she qualified (this is required practice when applying for the temporary expanded program). In the spring, after months of wrangling, she finally won forgiveness.\n\nThe headaches are worth the payoff\n\nBy the time Tomtschik\u2019s loans were forgiven last spring, her balance was $86,200 \u2013 which was $16,000 more than she originally borrowed.\n\nRead: The true cost of that student loan\n\n\u201cI am happy to know it\u2019s gone. My husband still has some student loan debt that we will pay off eventually,\u201d Tomtschik says.\n\nSvitavsky, meanwhile, says she had $80,971 of her original $97,115 in debt forgiven. Between submitting her first certification form in 2013 and getting forgiveness in April 2019, she paid nearly $20,000 in interest and less than $7,000 toward the principal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been this weird long blur,\u201d Svitavsky says.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "A librarian and a public defender did it.
