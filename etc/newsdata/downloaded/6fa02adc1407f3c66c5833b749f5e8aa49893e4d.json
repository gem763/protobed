It\u2019s this gap in strategic intelligence that motivated the founding of Aurora Insight, a Washington, D.C. startup using a sensor network and machine-learned digital signals to continuously sample the full radio spectrum.\n\nAurora Insight has achieved a measure of success in the three years since it emerged from stealth, attracting unnamed clients across four continents. In anticipation of accelerated growth, the company today revealed that it\u2019s raised fresh venture capital following a series A earlier this year led by Alsop Louie Partners and True Ventures. (True Ventures initially invested in 2017.) The round \u2014 which also saw participation from Tippet Venture Partners, Revolution\u2019s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Promus Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, ValueStream Ventures, and Intellectus Partners \u2014 brings its total raised to $18 million.\n\n\u201cThe boundaries of wireless are being redrawn,\u201d said cofounder and CEO Brian Mengwasser. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about phones anymore. Buildings have become base stations, factories operate their own LTE and 5G networks, and connected cars have five integrated receivers for different networks. Our customers don\u2019t have the time or money to deploy fleets of trucks and spectrum analyzers to determine if their wireless solutions are going to work. We enable more companies to design-to-reality and get more out of limited spectrum, which is part of everyone\u2019s technology stack now.\u201d\n\nAt a high level, Aurora Insight\u2019s product suite taps a combination of maps, near-real-time radio spectrum data, and analytics to help clients identify gaps in service. Its products are designed to help network operators and carriers deploy and optimize their spectrum, and to anticipate rollouts in the course of planning for expansion.\n\nAlsop Louie Partners and Aurora board member Gilman Louie asserts that conventional ad hoc spectrum measurement methods are \u201coutdated\u201d and provide only snapshots of connectivity. By contrast, Aurora Insight claims its approach reveals different patterns of spectrum occupancy (i.e., where operators have excess spectrum) and detect unused spectrum available for unlicensed use, as well as drill down to extract carrier and band information for individual cells (land areas served by at least one fixed-location transceiver) or clusters of cells.\n\n\u201cThe reality of \u2026 techniques employed by \u2026 networks means it\u2019s both more difficult and more important to quantify the radio spectrum,\u201d he added. \u201cHaving the accurate and near-real-time feedback on the radio spectrum that Aurora\u2019s technology offers could be the difference between building a \u2026 network right the first time, or having to build it twice.\u201d\n\nTrue Ventures partner and fellow Aurora Insight board member Rohit Sharma added, \u201cWireless spectrum is one of the most critical and valuable parts of the communications ecosystem worldwide. To date, it\u2019s been a massive challenge to accurately measure and dynamically monitor the wireless spectrum in a way that enables the best use of this scarce commodity. Aurora\u2019s proprietary approach gives businesses a unique way to analyze, predict, and rapidly enable the next-generation of wireless-enabled applications.\u201d", "description": "Aurora Insight, a startup leveraging a sensor network and AI algorithms to monitor cellular connectivity in near-real time, has raised $18 million.", "authors": ["Kyle Wiggers"], "top_image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ext-3.jpg?w=1200&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
