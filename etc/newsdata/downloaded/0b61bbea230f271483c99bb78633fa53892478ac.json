The problem is \u2013 this doesn\u2019t create a headline or a line for the Conservative Party\u2019s manifesto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearch also indicates the general public underestimate the true severity of sentencing \u2013 perhaps because politicians wanting to score political points constantly encourage them to do so.\n\nWhile articles declare our prisons have gone \u2018soft\u2019, the truth is that sentencing is much, much tougher than it used to be.\n\nWe have a higher proportion of life sentenced prisoners than any other country in Europe, including Russia and Turkey.\n\nYou may be thinking, \u2018but why is that a bad thing. Surely harsher sentences deter would-be criminals?\u2019\n\nLife would be a whole lot simpler if that were true, but there isn\u2019t a scrap of evidence so suggest it is. There\u2019s simply no link between the severity of sentencing in different countries and their crime rate.\n\nIf we\u2019re serious about reducing crime, the government needs to put much more energy into preventing people from committing it in the first place, and giving a realistic second chance to those that do.\n\nThe government knows this. Its own serious violence strategy acknowledges the weak evidence for punitive approaches and instead prioritises early intervention and the social causes of crime.\n\nThe Queen may have mentioned rehabilitation, but as we\u2019ve already established, longer sentences aren\u2019t the way to go about it.\n\nPrison inspectors regularly find people locked up for most of the day in conditions which demean them, and do nothing to get them ready to return to the communities to which they\u2019re eventually released.\n\nThe more ministers talk about rehabilitation, the less they seem prepared to actually do about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government\u2019s own evidence shows that effective rehabilitation means investment in community solutions for those on the cusp of custody.\n\nThose in prison are aware of how our broken our prison system is. Violence, self-harm and suicide are all at record levels and almost a quarter of prisoners live in overcrowded cells. Against this backdrop it is almost impossible for staff to focus on the rehabilitation of the people in their care.\n\nReducing pressures on our prisons by bringing numbers down to a level in line with other European countries is an essential step towards freeing the capacity and resource needed to bring about a more rehabilitative justice system.\n\nEarlier this year we, at Prison Reform Trust, counted up the promises government has made about prisons in just the last three years. We found 378 separate commitments, but nobody in government was able to tell us how many of them they still planned to implement \u2013 still fewer how many might have been delivered already.\n\nForever raising the bar on sentence length is a cynical diversion from the real issues and will make matters worse. All the people affected by crime \u2013 victims, offenders, and all the innocent families caught up in the mess we have created \u2013 deserve better.\n\nMORE: Plan to stop people voting without photo ID confirmed in Queen\u2019s Speech\n\nMORE: Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge at heart of Queen\u2019s Speech\n\nMORE: The bizarre traditions of the Queen\u2019s Speech and State Opening of Parliament", "description": "In the Queen's Speech she announced the government's plans to introduce longer prison sentences.", "authors": ["Peter Dawson", "Director Of Prison Reform Trust"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SEI_45147424-4705_1571149041.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
