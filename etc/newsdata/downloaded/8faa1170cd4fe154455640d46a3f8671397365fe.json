Steve Christo\n\nThe Greens and Australian Democrats decided to tap into anti-nuclear sentiment coursing through society by raising concerns about where the nuclear waste would be stored.\n\nThe Greens, which wanted to attract votes from the bigger Democrats party, saw a political opportunity to demand that the new law would state that it did not \"authorise the construction or operation\" of a nuclear power plant or uranium enrichment facility.\n\nAs a junior Labor spokesman for health, Forshaw had responsibility for the legislation in the upper house. On December 10, not long before the Senate broke for lunch, he announced that the Labor Party had agreed to the proposal, ensuring it would pass.\n\n\"We understand that there is no either medium-term or long-term intention on the part of the government to proceed to construct such facilities,\" then senator Forshaw said. \"On that basis alone, one would think that the government should be prepared to support this amendment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeeding the Senate's support to replace the ageing Lucas Heights plant with a new Argentinian reactor, prime minister John Howard's government didn't bother opposing the clause.\n\nOnly 10 of the 76 senators were present for the vote, including three from the Greens and Australian Democrats. \"The rest just accepted it without any opposition,\" the Bright New Future history says.\n\nThe process took six minutes.\n\nEleven hours later the law was approved by the House of Representatives, without a vote, at the direction of health minister Michael Wooldridge. \"I believe the amendments agreed to by the Senate will strengthen this legislation,\" Dr Wooldridge told the lower house.\n\nDee Margetts, a Greens senator from Western Australia, proposed the nuclear ban. Australian Parliament\n\nWaste concerns linger\n\nMr Forshaw, who chaired an inquiry into the replacement of the Lucas Heights reactor, on Monday said that he didn't regret Parliament's decision, and isn't convinced that nuclear can compete with other energy sources on cost.\n\nThe Greens senator who proposed the ban, Dee Margetts, wasn't well enough to answer questions, a party spokeswoman said. \"I am sure she would believe it is still the right decision though,\" she said. \"Dee never wavered in her stance on issues.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Forshaw said political agreement was needed on a central location to store nuclear waste for hundreds of years. Once that was settled, a rational debate about the cost and benefits of nuclear power would be appropriate, he said.\n\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" he said. \"On one occasion in France I went and had a look at the operations of a company over there at their nuclear power reactor, particularly their waste. I was quite impressed with the way they handled it.\n\n\"We should store our own. That's the requirement under international agreement. It's a real travesty we haven't been able to sort that out.\n\n\"If we can't get governments to make a decision about where to make a long-term nuclear storage facility \u2013 if we can't get that right I think we are a long way from making a reasoned decision on something like a nuclear power station.\"\n\nAnti-uranium protesters occupy a Sydney Westpac Bank branch in 1998.
