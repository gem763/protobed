We got on the plane and I put him in the overhead locker.\"\n\nThe bowler said the group thought it would be 'funny' to take the hitmaker home with them.\n\n(Image: Universal Images Group via Getty)\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar)\n\nHowever, passengers on Mr Narraway's flight were reportedly told that all of the airport's planes were grounded until the item was returned.\n\nThe pilot on the bowler's plane pledged there would be no consequences if Sir Cliff was returned immediately.\n\nHe immediately removed the cutout from his overhead locker and dropped it off at the cockpit.\n\nMr Narraway said the cabin crew were in fits of giggles, while the pilot shook his hand and told him it was the funniest moment of his career.", "description": "A British bowls club tried to fly home with Sir Cliff Richard's cardboard counterpart, but Portuguese officials failed to see the funny side", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Humphrey Nemar", "Universal Images Group Via Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20702841.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HN-Str221019cliffrichardspranster02seqnJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
