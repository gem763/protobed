Not even on the cable car? No stress.\n\nYou can still get the essence of Cape Town and its people in just a few hours. All the best shopping, views, and food, minus the crowds.\n\n1. Skip the V&A Waterfront and go shop on Kloof Street\n\nParking, queues, and just too many people in general, the Waterfront is a bit of a mess come peak season. Unless you're heading to the Watershed, which tends to be a bit less overcrowded.\n\nWhen you have only a couple of hours to spare, and some shopping to do, Kloof Street is your answer. From boutique clothing shops, to vintage, wine and wellness - look no further.\n\nREAD: Cape Town Summer Festivals 2019: Sip wine by the river or watch a movie under the moonlight\n\nAKJP STUDIO\n\nShop beautiful local designs at this collective shop. From Pichulik jewels to handbags, fragrances and clothing, this is a one-stop shop.\n\nThird Eye Wear\n\nGet all the latest sunglasses styles at this corner sunnies shop - all go for under R300!\n\nWine Concepts\n\nShop some lovely local wines at the Wine Concepts store located inside the Lifestyle on Kloof centre. Th shop also has daily tastings if you're keen to incorporate a wine tasting into your short trip.\n\n2. Don't even attempt to drive to Camps Bay if it's a nice day, rather go to the Sea Point Prom\n\nThe drive up Kloof Nek to go to Camps Bay on a nice, summer day, bad idea. Unless you wanted to spend your few hours in Cape Town in traffic, that is. Rather go to the Sea Point prom for a walk. Here you'll encounter real Capetonians: jogging, walking their dogs, cycling or having a Creamery ice cream as they stroll and chat.\n\nWATCH:From Cape Town to Cape Point by side car (with a dog named Brody in the backseat)\n\n3. No time to queue for breakfast pastries at Jason's or a pancake at Swan Cafe? Grab a bagel and coffee at New York Bagels\n\nSure, some of Cape Town's best brunch spots include Jason's, Swan Cafe on Buitenkant, and Kleinsky's in Sea Point. But when you are crunched for time, go to New York Bagels in Harrington Street. They usually have a queue going, but it's quick as the the super efficient and friendly staff make it flow.\n\nGet a salmon bagel bagel, a strong Deluxe coffee and sit outside while you chow down and watch locals pass by.\n\n4. Get the best view of Table Mountain from the comfort of a bench in the Company's Gardens\n\nInstead of heading up the mountain, look at it head-on from a bench in the centre of Cape Town. The Company's Gardens are the ideal place to take in the majestic mountain, towering over this beautiful city.\n\nOr do it in reverse and go walk up the steep streets of Oranjezicht. Walk up Molteno Road, pass or through De Waal Park, up, up, until your legs start to burn. Then, turn around and see this, the most epic view of Cape Town, all for free...\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
