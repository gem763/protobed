But as soon as I heard he had died I knew we had to do something.\n\n\"Reg's generation - the greatest generation - is now very few in number. These guys were willing, without a moment's hesitation, to put themselves in the firing line to save their country and the world from Nazism.\n\n\"It's vitally important we remember them.\"\n\n(Image: Portsmouth News/Solent News)\n\nMr Tegg is survived by his daughter Mandy, three grandchildren - Ashley, 22, Nathan, 21, and Marshall, 16 - wife Mary, 86, and nephew Martin Oates, 55.\n\nThe funeral will be held at Portchester Crematorium, near Fareham, Hants, at 11.15am on October 15.\n\nHundreds of people have already responded to a Facebook plea to attend the funeral and pay tribute to Reg.\n\nMandy, 47, was stunned by the response and said: \"It has brought me to tears more than once.\n\n\"He was a doting grandfather who loved his grandchildren. They couldn't have asked for a better grandfather.\"\n\nNephew Mr Oates - a Royal Navy chief petty officer - added: \"He was 101 and for six of those years it was carnage, stress and chaos.\n\n\"He lived peacefully after that. He was a quiet hero.\"", "description": "Reginald 'Reg' Tegg, who risked his his life to clear minefields during Nazi attacks, died at the age of 101 and has very little family", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Portsmouth News Solent News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553881.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
