REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nSet over several decades, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d looks at a Pennsylvania organized crime family with Oscar winners De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in the main roles.\n\nThe Netflix movie, which closes the BFI London Film Festival on Sunday, uses digital de-ageing technology to show the characters in their 30s and 40s. De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are all in their 70s.\n\nThe project is Scorsese\u2019s and De Niro\u2019s latest collaboration following acclaimed works like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d, \u201cRaging Bull\u201d, \u201cGoodfellas\u201d and \u201cCasino\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was really looking for something with Bob (De Niro) to enrich more or less where we had gone in the \u201870s and the \u201880s and the early \u201890s,\u201d Scorsese told a news conference.\n\n\u201cTo just replicate what we had been trying to do at the beginning of our careers wouldn\u2019t be enriching in any way.\u201d\n\nThe film, which runs just short of 3-1/2 hours, begins with elderly narrator Frank Sheeran, played by De Niro, recounting his life.\n\nTold in flashbacks, the audience sees him as a soldier, truck driver and eventually mob hitman after meeting organized crime boss Russell Bufalino, played by Pesci.\n\nThe plot, based on Charles Brandt\u2019s book \u201cI Heard You Paint Houses\u201d, is tied to the disappearance of former U.S. Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa, portrayed by Pacino in his first Scorsese collaboration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d known Marty and Bob a very long time so when Bob ... called me ... it sounded really interesting and the opportunity to work with them was very important to me,\u201d Pacino said. \u201cFor years, we almost worked together Marty and I.\u201d\n\nThe film, which has won rave reviews from critics touting it an Oscar contender, will have a limited theatrical run before and after its Nov. 27 Netflix release.\n\n\u201cThe original conception of what a film is and where it\u2019s to be seen has now changed so radically,\u201d Scorsese said.\n\n\u201cSomething that should always be protected as much as possible ... is a communal experience and I think that\u2019s best in the theater. Now homes are becoming theaters too, it\u2019s a major change and I think one has to keep an open mind.\u201d\n\nThe 76-year-old reiterated his comparison of superhero flicks to \u201ctheme park\u201d films, where he said \u201ctheaters become amusement parks\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a different experience ... it\u2019s not cinema it\u2019s something else whether you go for that or not ... and we shouldn\u2019t be invaded by it.\u201d\n\nAsked about watching younger versions of themselves, Pacino who described the de-ageing effects as \u201ca form of make-up\u201d, said: \u201cThis whole thing is innovative of course but at the same time, you tell a story, and in the end I\u2019m a little more concerned about that.\u201d\n\nAt a festival talk on Friday, De Niro reflected on his illustrious career, shared acting tips and renewed his criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI enjoy movies, I like the fact that ... they last forever,\u201d De Niro said, adding he hoped to be remembered \u201cfavorably\u201d.", "description": "Martin Scorsese reunites with Robert De Niro in \"The Irishman\", a 3-1/2 hour long mob drama the acclaimed director said he chose to do with his frequent collaborator to build on their past work together rather than replicate it.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440446672&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0KZ-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
