Last year Jeremy Yip, an expert in management from Georgetown University, along with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, decided to find out exactly how prevalent trash talk is among the employees of Fortune 500 companies. They surveyed 143 people about their experiences, and found that 61% could remember instances of trash talk that had occurred within the last three months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite prevalent and quite frequent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking really.\u201d So how is all this gutter talk affecting people? And should we all be honing our best put-downs?\n\nUnlikely motivator\n\nBut first \u2013 what actually is trash talk? The researchers defined it as \u201cboastful remarks about the self or insulting remarks about an opponent\u201d. Yip\u2019s favourite example of the latter occurred in 1999, when London was preparing to celebrate the new millennium.\n\nThis included the construction of a giant Ferris wheel, the now-iconic \u201cLondon Eye\u201d, which was sponsored by British Airways. Alas, in the final stages, it became clear that it wasn\u2019t going to be ready on time. Naturally this delighted Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of their rival, Virgin Atlantic, and he arranged for a blimp to fly over the half-finished attraction with a banner that read \u201cBA can\u2019t get it up!\u201d", "description": "Channelling your inner Muhammad Ali might not always be as reckless as it sounds.
