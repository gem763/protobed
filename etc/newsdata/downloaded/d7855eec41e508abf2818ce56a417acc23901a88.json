In France, workers now have the legal \u201cright to disconnect\u201d from work and New York City lawmakers have discussed a proposal to ban after-hours emails.\n\nThe most recent study surveyed 341 participants on their work email activities and conducted interviews with 28 others. Employees usually have one of four goals in mind when they answer work emails, researchers found: showing concern for a coworker, getting their work done effectively, preserving their own well-being, or having control over their work.\n\nIf an employee\u2019s goal is to prioritize work performance, even well-intentioned bans on work email could be unwelcome, researchers said. It\u2019s critical that employees have the ability to control their response to emails, the researchers said. That observation ties into previous research about the relationship between consistent work practices and happiness at work.\n\nSee also: The scientific way to slash the time you spend on work email by 50%\n\nHowever, being connected comes at a high cost. More than one in five workers say they\u2019ve checked work email in the middle of the night, and more than half say they read their work email while they\u2019re still in bed right after they wake up in the morning, a 2019 study of 2,000 employees by One Poll concluded.\n\nWorkers experience more burnout and are more likely to leave their jobs when they use their mobile devices during off hours, previous research has shown. There can also be a negative ripple effect on an employee\u2019s loved ones when they\u2019re glued to their Gmail GOOG, +0.05% GOOGL, -0.01% Apple iPhones AAPL, +1.73% or Blackberries BB, +2.56% at home.\n\nA 2018 study in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology found that when employees do work on their smartphones during family time, it negatively affects their spouse\u2019s job performance and job satisfaction.\n\nSimply the expectation that workers should be available to answer messages during off hours can increase anxiety levels for both employees and their family members, one Virginia Tech study found.", "description": "Employees need to feel a sense of control at their jobs, research suggests.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT734_checki_ZG_20191021163600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
