On Monday, the investment bank significantly jacked up its 2020 5G smartphone estimates to 120 million from 50 million. Analyst Rod Hall points to his supply chain research indicating \u201cmuch higher\u201d 5G device sales than previously expected, particularly in China.\n\nHall had believed that 5G would only be available in limited parts of the world with Chinese network build outs delayed due to Huawei trade restrictions. But the analyst now sees 5G supply chain equipment bottlenecks easing in China.\n\n\u201cWe believe Huawei\u2019s ability to build 5G NR gNBs without U.S. components should help to drive meaningful deployments in China in 2020 which support additional Chinese 5G device sales,\u201d Hall wrote in a new research note today.\n\n5G \u2014 which essentially gives ultra fast downloads to users \u2014 is expected to be a significant catalyst for the communications industry. The technology being put in place today by Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile (TMUS) and AT&T (T) is likely to reap big-time profits for the cohort over time as consumers pay up to gain access to better download speeds.\n\nWall Street generally thinks Verizon is ahead of its rivals in rolling out 5G. Verizon is fresh off switching on 5G capabilities in parts of New York City \u2014 it\u2019s on track to have 5G in 30 cities by the end of 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the likes of Apple, Samsung and even Huawei will see consumers drop their old 4G phones and trade up to new offerings that unlock 5G\u2019s true potential.\n\nDisclosure: Verizon Communications is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
