The Walkers will remain cornerstone investors in its projects.\n\nHe has also expanded Evolve's development pipeline with the acquisition of a permit-approved apartment site at 135 Sturt Street in Southbank, which he will take to market next year, to complement a big greenfield landholding in Clyde in the south-east awaiting rezoning.\n\nEvolve has also acquired its own office digs \u2013 an old warehouse on Union Street in South Melbourne \u2013 where it will relocate to after a refresh and fitout.\n\nThe move will see Evolve leave its long-time premises at the foot of the landmark Domain building opposite the Royal Botanic Gardens on St Kilda Road. The high-rise tower was completed in 1995 by Mr Walker and Lloyd William's Hudson Conway development company with Evolve's offices sitting above the private office of the late Mr Walker.\n\nWhile Mr Williams has retained the support of the major banks \u2013 ANZ funded Botanic a month after Mr Walker died \u2013 he has not been immune to the residential downturn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSales at Evolve's Botanic project dragged on for 12 to 18 months longer then prior projects, and the development is not yet sold out.\n\nThis year, the Financial Review Rich List team estimated his wealth at $470 million, a drop of 43 per cent from 2017, and just below the 2019 cut off of $472 million.\n\nMr Williams strongly disputed this figure and declined to be interviewed or submit any information for the 2019 Rich List.\n\nBut he said: \"The market has been pretty tough, I don\u2019t think anyone would shy away from that. My sense is that it has bottomed out in terms of a lack of activity.\n\nMr Williams with his late business partner and mentor Ron Walker, left. joshrobenstone.com\n\n\"It's really just question of timing and how the market responds to turnaround; if buyers come back with confidence, whether banks lend and if that change in sentiment translates into contracts. At the moment I\u2019d say its still pretty early in the [recovery] process.\"\n\nHe warned that Melbourne was \"definitely heading towards an undersupply of dwellings\".\n\n\"If you look at the number of projects shelved in this part of the market, there's been a huge amount of supply being withdrawn from the market,\" he said.\n\n\"That means less construction and less finished supply and that\u2019s in the context of a market with a vacancy rate hovering at just 2 per cent.\"", "description": "Ashley Williams says his late business partner, Ron Walker, taught him the importance of being risk-averse and only dealing with the major banks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4723%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1112%2C$y_612/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/769db98bcb5e8fdf60ab40c53218cde8a049c2f9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
