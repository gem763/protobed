PayScale, a provider of salary, benefits and compensation data, recently identified five jobs in five industries it thinks could withstand the inevitable job cuts that come with a recession:\n\nGraphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nCloud computing\n\n\u201cCloud computing is an incredibly lucrative pillar of the modern economy and has the intense focus of the tech giants of the world,\u201d Sudarshan Sampath, director of research at PayScale, told Yahoo Finance. That is why jobs within the industry, such as IT architect, could prove indispensable even during a recession.\n\n\u201cIf you think about somewhere like Amazon (AMZN), a lot of their revenue growth is from Amazon Web Services (AWS). The same goes for Microsoft (MSFT) with Azure,\u201d he said. A main reason companies invest in cloud computing is flexibility. For example, it\u2019s easier to give an employee a laptop and have him or her connect to an Azure API or AWS API and compute in the cloud. This reduces material costs by leveraging the relatively cheap costs of the cloud, Sampath said.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nIntelligence, machine, industrial, manufacture, factory More\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) was once considered fodder for science fiction films, but in the present day, the industry is all too real. Sampath notes that there are only about 22,000 qualified AI specialists in the world \u2014 and that scarcity is what will insulate workers in the field.\n\nThough often seen by many as most useful in a scientific setting, AI can help businesses find the best candidates for a job by combing through job applications. Now more companies are using biometric fingerprint technology for security and data validation purposes, and AI drives all of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to look through and comb big data and actually provide insight in an easier way,\u201d Sampath explained.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nWhen there\u2019s a ton of cyber data, there is a ton of cyber risk, Sampath said. The massive data breaches and hacks that have taken place at global companies such as Facebook (FB) and Equifax is proof that this profession is necessary, even during a recession, he added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much interaction with tons of different types of data and media that you need to have a better way of protecting it.\u201d\n\nBig data analytics\n\nSampath tells Yahoo Finance that big data analytics is an extremely complex field that has a lot of different functions. A data scientist who understands big data analytics is an extremely valuable asset who can mold and shape terabytes of data for needs such as codifying and accessing data, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in having all the world at your feet, at your fingertips if you don\u2019t know how to, you know, really engage with it in a meaningful way. That\u2019s where the data scientists and analytics comes in.\u201d\n\nDigital marketing\n\n\u201cDigital marketing is incredibly valuable because a lot of these firms need to find ways to become profitable,\u201d said Sampath of the fifth most recession-proof field. \u201cLike how do you monetize like a Google search?\u201d This was something that many companies did not know how to do years ago, he added.", "description": "With a possible recession looming, many Americans are wondering if their jobs are secure.
