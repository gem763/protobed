Over the years, she advances in her career alongside male colleagues. Yet on the way to the top, she hits an invisible barrier to the highest corridors of power.\n\nLong before bumping into any glass ceiling, many women run into obstacles trying to grasp the very first rung of the management ladder\u2014and not because they are pausing their careers to raise children\u2014a new, five-year landmark study shows. As a result, it\u2019s early in many women\u2019s careers, not later, when they fall dramatically behind men in promotions, blowing open a gender gap that then widens every step up the chain.\n\nThe numbers tell a stark story: Though women and men enter the workforce in roughly equal numbers, men outnumber women nearly 2 to 1 when they reach that first step up\u2014the manager jobs that are the bridge to more senior leadership roles. In real numbers, that will translate to more than one million women across the U.S. corporate landscape getting left behind at the entry level over the next five years as their male peers move on and upward, perpetuating a shortage of women in leadership positions.\n\nFew efforts are likely to remedy the problem as much as tackling the gender imbalance in initial promotions into management, says Lareina Yee, a senior partner at McKinsey & Co., which co-led the research with LeanIn.Org. If companies in the U.S. continue to make the same, tiny gains in the numbers of women they promote and hire into management every year, it will be another 30 years before the gap between first-level male and female managers closes, McKinsey estimates. But fix that broken bottom rung of the corporate ladder, and companies could reach near-parity all the way up to their top leadership roles within a generation.\n\nEarlier than believed\n\nThose are some of the key findings of the fifth annual Women in the Workplace study conducted by Lean In and McKinsey, one of the most comprehensive examinations to date of the experiences of working women and men. Data from 329 companies with a collective 13 million people on their payrolls (including Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal) suggest the barriers holding women back from equal power and influence in the workplace emerge much earlier than many corporate leaders believe.\n\nMen outnumber women nearly 2 to 1 on the first move up the management ladder. WSJ\u2019s Vanessa Fuhrmans explains how this can hurt women right out of the gate.\n\n\u201cBias still gets in the way\u2014bias of who you know, who\u2019s like you, or who performs and operates the same way you perform and operate, whose style is more similar,\u201d says Carolyn Tastad, group president of Procter & Gamble\u2019s North American operations. But \u201cwe have to find ways to pull all this talent up through the pipeline.\u201d She adds: \u201cThe even bigger question is: What can it do for our business?\u201d\n\nA growing body of research links greater gender diversity on teams and in corporate management to more innovation and better financial performance. That business case is a big reason more senior leaders at companies\u201473%\u2014say achieving equality for women in the workplace is a priority, up from 56% four years ago.\n\nYet fewer than a fifth of employers surveyed attributed the gender gap in their own management ranks to women losing the first-time promotion race, the data show. This is even though for every 100 men promoted or hired into junior management roles, only 72 women are, a ratio that has barely budged from 2015. The percentage of black and Hispanic women getting that initial shot at leading others is even lower.\n\nEmployers\u2019 moves to diversify their most senior echelons could provide a road map, says Rachel Thomas, president of Lean In, the nonprofit founded by Facebook Inc. \u2019s Sheryl Sandberg to support women in their career ambitions. Over the five years of the study, women have made the biggest gains at the very top of the corporate ladder in the C-suite, as companies have trained their sights on grooming a select cadre of high-potential senior-level women for the biggest jobs in management. Nearly half of companies have at least three women in their top leadership teams, up from 29% in 2015. Overall, the share of women in the C-suite has climbed to 21% from 17% five years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that if companies really put their minds to it, they can bring about change that matters,\u201d Ms. Thomas says. \u201cIf they can apply the same extra elbow grease that they do at the top to the broken rung, I\u2019m bullish they can fix it.\u201d\n\nThe Problem Starts Early Falling Behind Fast It Isn\u2019t Due to Attrition\u2026 Women move up the career ladder in smaller numbers than men at every stage but lose the most ground early.

The 3,000-person biotech firm in San Rafael, Calif., launched a pilot with Pluma, a web and mobile platform that provides video-session coaching, with 51 participants, 28 of them women. Since then, 35% of the women and 14% of the men have moved up into new jobs.\n\nOne of them, Lillian Lee, landed a role as associate director in clinical operations, guiding a team of nearly 20 people that runs clinical trials of drugs, a big jump from her previous role overseeing a few direct reports. Her regular coaching sessions helped her realize getting ahead didn\u2019t require \u201cjust putting your head down and doing the work,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be known for your work, relationships are fundamental.\u201d\n\nNo lack of ambition\n\nThe numbers show that the first step is the steepest for women. But why is that? What\u2019s holding women back from climbing that first rung into management?\n\nWhat \u2018Women\u2019s Work\u2019 Looks Like Women make up about half of the U.S. workforce today, but many jobs remain largely segregated along gender lines. Explore the fields in which women have made the most inroads, and the least.\n\nIt isn\u2019t for lack of ambition. Roughly equal numbers of men and women say they\u2019ve recently sought a promotion\u201427% and 29% respectively\u2014according to the Lean In and McKinsey data. Among women of color, the appetite for winning promotions is even greater. Nor are women abandoning their careers in larger numbers than men for family or other reasons, the data show.\n\nYet while many employers have increased their efforts to groom and elevate more senior women\u2014a smaller, select group\u2014fewer have applied the same rigor to cultivating more junior female managers. More than 40% of companies said they set gender diversity targets for senior management; a third do the same at the junior level. And though nearly half of senior leaders said they actively try to foster more diversity and inclusion, just 16% of front-line managers said so.\n\nThe upshot: At nearly every career stage, the disparities between men and women have narrowed only marginally since the Women in the Workplace research began in 2015. Even in industries with largely female entry-level workforces, such as retail and health care, men come to dominate the management ranks\u2014a phenomenon that Haig Nalbantian, a labor economist and co-leader of consulting firm Mercer LLC\u2019s Workforce Sciences Institute, calls \u201cthe flip.\u201d\n\nTo help companies understand where and why they are losing women along the chain, Mr. Nalbantian deploys predictive analytics to create elaborate flow charts of the number of men and women promoted, hired and leaving their jobs at every level of the organization. Some employers, he says, are in industries dominated by men top to bottom. The pattern he sees more often, though, is sizable numbers of women occupying jobs at the bottom of the pyramid\u2014but at the junior and midlevel management levels, men suddenly pull sharply ahead. From there to the top, men increasingly outnumber women.\n\nBright Spot Women\u2019s presence in the C-suite has increased. 2015 2019 Companies with 3+ women in C-suite 29% 44% Percentage of open C-suite positions that went to women 27% 35%\n\n\u201cIn all my years of doing this, and I have done this for hundreds of companies, I have yet to see an organization that doesn\u2019t have a flip,\u201d he says of the companies in which women make up a fair share of the entry-level workforce.\n\nOne factor, he says, is that even in many \u201cfemale-friendly\u201d sectors, entry-level women still tend to get hired into jobs with limited upward mobility, such as bank tellers or customer-service staff. In more professional-level roles, women also are less likely to be in jobs that can accelerate careers, such as dealing with high-profile clients or helping build a line of business. More often, they take on or are steered into support roles, such as project management.\n\nThe hot jobs\n\nEven among men and women identified as having high potential from the start, women are less likely to get the \u201chot jobs\u201d that are springboards to bigger roles. In a 2012 study of more than 1,600 M.B.A. graduates by the research and advocacy group Catalyst, men reported leading projects with larger teams and budgets twice the size of women\u2019s. Their work was also more likely to be on the radar of the C-suite.\n\n\u201cWhen companies ask, \u2018What\u2019s the one thing we can do systemically?\u2019 we say, \u2018It\u2019s not quotas, it\u2019s not targets,\u2019\u201d says Mr. Nalbantian. \u201cIt\u2019s about how do you position women and minorities to succeed in the roles that are likely to lead to higher-level positions.\u201d\n\nOver time, many women come to see a workplace stacked against them. Among the more than 68,500 employees whom McKinsey and Lean In also surveyed from the participating companies, a quarter of women said their gender had played a role in a missed promotion or raise. Even more expected it to make it harder for them to get ahead in the future.\n\nRebecca Weizenecker sought a promotion at a financial-services firm and asked about her weaknesses. She made a 90-day plan to address them\u2014and got the job. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe takeaway for some women is that they have to assemble their own career ladder. After working for more than a year in sales at an Atlanta-based financial-services company, Rebecca Weizenecker wanted to vie for a job heading a direct-sales team. Before applying, she went to the hiring manager and asked him to be candid about her strengths and weaknesses. At 24, she lacked experience, he said. She pressed for specifics.\n\n\u201c\u2018What are the specific gaps, and are we talking 10 years of experience or is this a three-month learning curve?\u201d she says she asked. When he told her it was probably a matter of months rather than years, Ms. Weizenecker put together a 90-day plan that included additional training. Soon after, she landed the job.\n\n\u201cI made it hard for them to say no,\u201d says Ms. Weizenecker, now 29 and vice president of sales and marketing at FundThrough, another financial-technology firm.\n\nMaking the call\n\nAt Synchrony Financial, where 46% of all managers are women, CEO Margaret Keane says she wanted to build a sturdier bridge from the entry-level jobs in the consumer bank and credit-card issuer\u2019s call centers to the managerial track. Many of those jobs are held by women. \u201cI feel I have as a woman CEO a responsibility in terms of driving the culture,\u201d says Ms. Keane, who began her own career in a bank call center.\n\nOne way is a nine-month development program that allows call-center and administrative staff to hone their management skills, such as leading meetings and giving high-ranking executives their elevator pitches, while exploring different career paths across the company. Of the several hundred employees who have completed the program since it began in 2013, more than 250 have been promoted to managerial positions, 60% of them women.\n\nOne is 29-year-old TJ Wright, a bank representative who jumped to become an assistant vice president in Synchrony\u2019s consumer-banking operations in Charlotte, N.C., in January. Key to landing it, she says, were a couple of senior executives who sponsored her, championing her for bigger roles. Unlike mentors, who largely offer informal guidance, sponsors open doors to other powerful contacts and advocate for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s when big projects or promotions come up\u2014something the McKinsey and Lean In data show is instrumental in propelling the careers of both men and women.\n\n\u201cWhen I got my new job, I was so excited to tell my sponsors,\u201d Ms. Wright says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We know, we were in the room having those conversations about you!\u2019 \u201d Nearly a year into her new role, she has mapped out her next couple of potential moves and hopes to land a promotion to vice president next. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pace myself a little bit,\u201d she says.\n\nTJ Wright took advantage of a development program at Synchrony Financial to move from a call center and become an assistant V.P. in consumer banking. Photo: Swikar Patel for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe sponsor\u2019s role\n\nAt Bank of America, where more than 40% of people in management are women, sponsorships play a critical role in helping women advance, says Cynthia Bowman, head of diversity and inclusion and talent acquisition at the bank. To secure a sponsor, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to consistently perform, have a strong brand and deliver. That\u2019s just table stakes,\u201d she says. \u201cBut a lot of people do that and might still not move, because they don\u2019t have the right support.\u201d\n\nUp-and-coming women have the chance to be matched to senior players in several ways. Over the past three years, more than 4,100 women have participated in one of the company\u2019s formal career-development programs, through which many get sponsors. The bank estimates many more women have found sponsors through other programs within its various lines of business and regular forums it organizes for them to get facetime with high-level executives.\n\nIndustry by Industry Women\u2019s share of employment at each level of selected industries Entry level Manager Senior manager/director Vice president Senior vice president C-suite 0% 10 20 30 40 50 60 Entry level Manager Senior manager/director Vice president Senior vice president C-suite Entry level Manager Senior manager/director Vice president Senior vice president C-suite 0% 10 20 30 40 50 60 Entry level Manager Senior manager/director Vice president Senior vice president C-suite 0% 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nTo measure how its efforts are working, Bank of America tracks its workforce data meticulously. At least once a month, senior leaders receive updated scorecards tracking the representation of women at every level. Lower-level managers are also expected to meet certain goals, such as interviewing a diverse slate of candidates for open positions.\n\nProcter & Gamble also takes a granular approach to evening the gender playing field. Women hold 47% of all management roles at P&G, up from 44% four years ago. The consumer-goods giant applies the same rigorous approach that it uses for market research to help employees map their career-development plans. When the company spotted a drop in the share of midlevel female managers, it started tracking their progression earlier and more closely.\n\n\u201cToday we can pull that data, slice it by function, by geography. We can spot weaknesses quickly and whether they might lead to a pipeline deficit,\u201d says Deanna Bass, P&G\u2019s director of global diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe individual career plans identify what sorts of experience employees need and are acquiring, and the likely next promotions they have the potential to attain. If someone has been in a job longer than initially mapped, \u201cit allows us to go back to her manager and say, \u2018She\u2019s been here several years and hasn\u2019t moved. Can she be promoted?\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cThe role of the manager is critical to their success.\u201d\n\nLuz Damaris Rosario, who manages a Goya Foods plant, credits an early promotion with lifting her career and giving her exposure to senior executives. Photo: Julia Robinson for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLuz Damaris Rosario, who began working as a chemist at Goya Foods when she was 22 and now oversees one of the company\u2019s largest food-production plants, in Houston, credits an early promotion with catapulting her career. Within two years of joining the company, she was made a laboratory manager, overseeing a team of scientists in a Puerto Rico plant producing canned beans and tomato sauce.\n\n\u201cThat promotion empowered me,\u201d she says, adding that it gave her greater access to senior Goya executives and a broader understanding of how the company operates. \u201cIt was, \u2018The world belongs to me,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nOne of those senior leaders, the president of Goya\u2019s Puerto Rico operations at the time, helped pay for her to get an M.B.A. after she told him she hoped to head one of the company\u2019s operations one day. Now, at 56 and with many more promotions under her belt, Ms. Rosario says she advises younger women to stay alert to new roles and look for ways to grow.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re competing with your male counterparts,\u201d she says. \u201cJust compete with yourself.\u201d\n\nMs. Fuhrmans is The Wall Street Journal\u2019s deputy bureau chief for management in New York.
