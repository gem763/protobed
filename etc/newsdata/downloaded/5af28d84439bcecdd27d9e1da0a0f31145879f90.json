Cramped in your allotted seat, uncomfortably aware that the guy next to you has watched the in-flight edition of Disney\u2019s Aladdin five times on loop, the thought of getting home is all that keeps you going.\n\nAnd what joy it is to get home! The only thing that can make emerging from the airport feel better is when you have someone there to welcome you, ideally with a hug, some coffee, and a big hand-drawn sign about how much they missed you.\n\nBut Japanese conductor Miho Hazama got one of the world\u2019s most exciting and extravagant welcome parties when she flew into Denmark\u2019s Copenhagen Airport\u2026 and all the other fliers got to enjoy it, too!\n\nAn established composer, Tokyo-born Hazama signed on as the official conductor for the Danish Radio Big Band earlier this year. She\u2019s a decorated composer and performer, with her own signature ensemble named m_unit, and she\u2019s arranged and orchestrated compositions of many other legendary musicians such as Ryuichi Sakamoto, Shiro Sagisu, and even Queen.\n\nWith multiple composition awards under her belt, Hazama would make an attractive candidate for any big band outfit, and the Danish Radio Big Band wanted to make it clear how grateful they were that of all the big bands in the world, she decided to conduct for theirs.\n\nAs she stepped into the arrivals area at Copenhagen airport, a drum began to sound, and she clearly noticed the cluster of performers at the gate because her face immediately lit up. She looked delighted, albeit a little embarrassed, as she dramatically shushed the band with her finger.\n\nAs the band launched into their rousing rendition of John Kander\u2019s \"Wilkommen Bienvenue Welcome,\" with the lyrics tweaked to suit Hazama herself, she turned from performer to performer, beaming the whole time. The icing on the cake was when a velvet cushion emerged, bearing a conductor\u2019s baton. And of course, that same baton ended up in Hazama\u2019s hands so she could conduct the rest of the piece.\n\nFrom the cutaways to uninvolved passengers (including families, lone travelers and even an adorable puppy), it seemed that Hazama wasn\u2019t the only one enjoying her musical welcome.\n\nSource: YouTube/DR Koncerthuset, Miho Hazama Official Website\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Awash in a sea of sound: The ambient electronic music of Sapporo artist Unii\u3010J-Tunes\u3011\n\n-- Japanese violinist whose face and music are equally beautiful causes a stir online\n\n-- Celebrate May with a visit to Mei and Satsuki\u2019s house from Ghibli\u2019s My Neighbor Totoro\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/27/danish-radio-big-band-welcomes-new-japanese-conductor-with-big-band-airport-bash%E3%80%90video%E3%80%91/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Hands up, everybody \u2014 who here has experienced a long haul flight?
