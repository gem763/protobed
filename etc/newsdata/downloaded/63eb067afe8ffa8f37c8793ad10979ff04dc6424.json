It stopped Donald Trump Jr. cold.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son had been in the midst of a humor-laced screed in which he decried Joe Biden as too old and Elizabeth Warren as too liberal and insisted his father\u2019s 2016 campaign was too disorganized to possibly collude with the Russians. As many in the crowd of several hundred laughed, Trump Jr. held a dramatic pause before exclaiming his response:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s worry about 2020 first!\u201d he yelled.\n\nThe son has become the prime warmup act for the father at political rallies, often appearing more than an hour before the president speaks, another bombastic provocateur who revels in the tribal loyalty of the supporters who pack Trump rallies. It is a call to arms to a fawning crowd and Donald Jr. has become a master preacher.\n\nHis speeches are laced with the same incendiary, sometimes false rhetoric as his father\u2019s, at times even questioning whether Democrats can call themselves Christians. But in these venues, his word is gospel.\n\nThe \u201c2024\u201d call from the audience at a San Antonio convention center room on Tuesday underscored the rising stardom of the president\u2019s eldest son, who has become the swaggering embodiment of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d ethos.\n\nBy far the presidential scion with the closest connection to conservative voters, Trump Jr. is already playing a key role in his father reelection effort, especially in strongly Republican districts. But where he was once under the scrutiny of special counsel Robert Mueller, now he is drawing criticism for seemingly hypocritical attacks on another son of a famous politician.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t seem to care at all.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, my father said something very serious. He goes: \u2018What do you have to lose?\u2019 And he was right,\u201d said Trump Jr, broadening a pitch the president first made to black voters to reach the entire electorate. \u201cSo America, you gave him a chance and he has delivered on those promises. Now, what do you have to lose? A lot.\u201d\n\nAnd then Trump Jr, who was the headliner on this warm October day, gleefully skewered one of the president\u2019s Democratic foes. \u201cJoe Biden, when on the campaign trail, his whole thesis was that government has failed. No s\u2014t, Joe!\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. was one of the campaign\u2019s potent tools in 2016, frequently sent out to small towns and rural areas where the Republican candidate looked to turn out disaffected voters who hadn\u2019t cast ballots in years. An even more aggressive campaign schedule is in the works for 2020.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the future,\u201d said Annie Davidson, 65, of Alamo Heights. \u201cHe\u2019s just like his father and I can\u2019t wait to vote for him someday too.\u201d\n\nBy far the most outspoken of his siblings, Trump Jr. has never shied away from a political fight, even when it leads some to question his own sense of self-awareness.\n\nHe has been one of the loudest critics of Biden\u2019s son Hunter, suggesting that Hunter Biden only had opportunities in other countries, including Ukraine, because of family connections.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re the father and your son\u2019s entire career is dependent on that, they own you,\u201d Trump Jr. told Fox News this past week.\n\nSome critics could not resist noting that Donald Trump Jr. shares both the first and last names of a man who gave him his high-paying corporate job and elevated his standing during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was the president\u2019s push for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens that prompted House Democrats to launch an impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re left with a situation where every presidential action is under a cloud of suspicion for corruption, and that suspicion increasingly seems justified,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nTrump Jr. has pushed back, suggesting that his criticism of Hunter Biden was not for having a famous father, but rather for trading access to his father\u2019s office to enrich himself. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden\n\nHunter Biden told ABC this past week that while his decision to take the job was not unethical, it showed \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d But he also made clear that \u201cTrump Jr. is not somebody that I really care about.\u201d\n\nMoreover, despite a pledge to immediately cease all international business once the president took office, the Trump Organization has continued to work on previously struck agreements and profited from the presidency. Congress has called for investigations into foreign officials being steered to stay at the Trump hotel in Washington and Air Force crew members spending nights at Trump\u2019s Scotland golf resort.\n\nTrump Jr.\u2019s eyebrow-raising attacks on another political son came just days after he had to distance himself from a headline-grabbing tempest when it was revealed that he had recently attended a Florida conference for Trump supporters where a parody video was screened that depicted the president killing members of the news media and political opponents.\n\nTrump Jr. said he never saw the video, which aired as part of a three-day conference at the president\u2019s golf club outside Miami. But Trump Jr., who prides himself in his ability to use social media to poke at liberals, was quick to draw an equivalency on Friday. He used Twitter to point out an apparel company\u2019s Midtown Manhattan billboard that depicted the president being assaulted.\n\n\u201cSince you had time to thoroughly cover a stupid and tasteless meme seen by 8 people with incredible outrage, I figured you should dedicate the same time and outrage to THIS BILLBOARD IN TIMES SQUARE you hypocrites!\u201d he tweeted. \u201cUnless of course you\u2019re just full of s\u2014t.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. has long relished posting button-pushing tweets. His Twitter feed has traded in conspiracy theories and hardline messages about immigration and gun control and he has a book on the way that hits the same themes. He once circulated a post that compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles candy that contained some that \u201cwould kill you.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. declined a request for an interview for this story.\n\nHe is unbowed and unapologetic, and his approach appears to mirror his father\u2019s combative defiance toward the controversies that swirl around the White House and the Trump family.\n\nThough he runs the Trump Organization with his brother, Eric, Trump Jr.\u2019s political obligations frequently keep him far from his office on the 25th floor of Trump Tower. The more politically minded of the two brothers, Trump Jr. has embraced his role as a popular emissary for his father, crisscrossing the country on campaign trips, showcasing his relationship with former Fox News host Kim Guilfoyle and headlining Republican fundraisers.\n\nThough he grew up in Manhattan and Florida\u2019s gilded coast, Trump Jr. has established deep ties among rural Republicans and has become an outspoken defender of the Second Amendment. He is viewed by many close to the president as a more logical political heir apparent than his sister, the far more cosmopolitan and refined Ivanka Trump. Where Ivanka Trump, a senior White House aide, has taken to promoting women\u2019s and economic issues while hovering in diplomatic circles at international summits, Trump Jr.\u2019s Instagram feed is filled with hunting and fishing photos.\n\nIn 2018, he did more than 70 events for GOP candidates and state parties and will easily eclipse that next year when his father\u2019s name is on the ballot. Those close to him say he may run for office someday, but probably not until after his five children are considerably older.\n\nHis front-and-center role for the campaign is a relatively unusual one for recent presidential offspring. Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton had children too young to campaign. And while President George H.W. Bush\u2019s adult children - including a future president - were in Washington at times, they did not assume the star presence of Trump Jr.\n\nHe has not shied away from the spotlight or criticism, having been battle-hardened by the pressure he faced during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, which looked into a 2016 meeting Trump Jr. had with a Kremlin-connected lawyer seeking damaging information on Hillary Clinton. No charges were brought against him.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump Jr. derides the impeachment inquiry and credits his father\u2019s business acumen for economic gains, declaring in San Antonio: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have someone running the country who has signed the front of a paycheck and not just the back.\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared and Guilfoyle applauded. After the rally, the eldest Trump son headlined a big-dollar dinner in Texas and, days later, was barnstorming in West Virginia for more Republican candidates.\n\nThere was more talk of, someday, a possible Trump political dynasty.\n\n\u201cI expect Don to be a player in the conservative movement for years and years to come,\u201d said Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist who advises Trump Jr.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Donald Trump Jr. has become the prime warmup act for the father at political rallies, often appearing more than an hour before the president speaks, another bombastic provocateur who revels in the tribal loyalty of the supporters who pack Trump rallies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Lemire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/trump_jr._65155_c0-153-3658-2286_s1200x700.jpg?99e51d54a122eb6976fba1c873250d0336f42bf7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
