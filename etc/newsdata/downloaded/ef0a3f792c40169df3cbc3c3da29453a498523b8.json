I arrived back at Heathrow late in the morning and by the afternoon I was sketching Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference at the G7 summit. Since then, politics has become progressively more mad: so much so it\u2019s even affecting my sleep. Last night I had a dream that I was crossing and recrossing the Irish border, petrified I was going to be stopped by guards. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s one I need to take to my shrink for interpretation. But the holiday was wonderful \u2013 the first time we had all been together as a family since last Christmas \u2013 with plenty of lazing around beside lakes as well as more energetic activities. The one downside, apart from the expense \u2013 the government\u2019s efforts to drive the pound towards parity with the dollar to simplify a US-UK trade deal did us no favours \u2013 was that we got to learn more about the workings of the American healthcare system than we anticipated after my wife broke her thumb playing softball. Just as well she had taken out insurance \u2013 though we never managed to reclaim the unused tokens at the baseball centre that another family stole from us while we were tending to my wife \u2013 as her treatment came to just short of $8,000 (\u00a36,500). Needless to say, on our return home, the doctors here said they would never have repaired the break with pins that large. It was like listening to one builder inspecting another\u2019s work.\n\nTuesday\n\nAn extraordinary day in Westminster, which began with Johnson giving a statement on the G7, prorogation and the general election he said he didn\u2019t want but was clearly desperate for, and continued with Michael Gove giving a statement in which he refused to discuss the no-deal preparations outlined in Operation Yellowhammer on the grounds that they were top secret. Despite them having been leaked to the Sunday Times two weeks previously. Then came the emergency debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit, in which Jacob Rees-Mogg threw a temper tantrum, lay down on the front bench and demanded nanny bring him his bottle, and ended with Johnson losing his first vote in the House of Commons as prime minister. As a result of which, 21 senior Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond, Justine Greening and Nicholas Soames were deselected. The man who considers himself a latter-day Churchill had just kicked Churchill\u2019s grandson out of the Conservative party. All the while, Johnson\u2019s key special adviser, Dominic \u201cDom and Dommer\u201d Cummings, was lurking in the background, Kool-Aid in hand and shouting at his shadow while trying to pretend everything was working out exactly as Classic Dom had planned. To cap it all, I received a press release saying David Icke was publishing a new book on the real truth behind September 11. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to distinguish between satire and reality. I\u2019m often asked if it\u2019s easier to be a sketch writer now that the absurd has become the norm. I actually find it increasingly difficult to see the funny side of anything. Rather I feel like I have become a stenographer failing to keep pace with events.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ken Clarke to Theresa May: \u2018He\u2019s even worse than you.\u2019 Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/PA\n\nWednesday\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions proved to be his second car crash in as many days. Most Tory MPs had assumed his hopeless performance at the dispatch box the previous day had just been an aberration and the man who had sold himself to them as the \u201cGreat Entertainer\u201d would live up to his reputation. If anything, he was even more hopeless. Too much more of this and Tories will be sending letters to the 1922 Committee demanding the return of Theresa May. At least she used to make an attempt at engaging with questions, even if she seldom provided any direct answers. Johnson merely alternated between mumbling and shouting, while insisting his Brexit negotiations would be going swimmingly once he actually got round to starting them and just making facts up to suit himself. He even insisted the Andrew Marr interview in which Gove admitted some food prices could go up \u2013 yippee, it\u2019s dog biscuits all round from November onwards \u2013 had never taken place. You\u2019d have thought someone with a long history of lying to his family and friends would be rather better at lying to parliament. Long before the end, you could see the desperation on the Conservative benches. Not even his fellow cabinet members could summon up much enthusiasm. One Tory MP sent me a simple text that read, \u201cHe is appalling\u201d. It was reported this week that Johnson\u2019s election slogan is likely to be \u201cTrust the people\u201d. A hard sell when not even his own MPs trust him.\n\nThursday\n\nOne of the other great pleasures of going on holiday is the chance to sit down and read a book \u2013 The Great Romantic, Duncan Hamilton\u2019s biography of the Guardian cricket and music writer Neville Cardus, was an utter joy. I also love wandering around bookshops in the US to check out how different their bestseller charts are from ours in the UK. Apart from the usual rash of How to Get On in Business and Make a Fortune books, what struck me from going to Barnes & Noble was the number of titles about heroic dogs that were in its top 20. I counted at least three. There was The Art of Racing in the Rain: Meet the Dog who will Show the World how to be Human, the story of how a pooch brought a family together and turned a bloke into a racing driver. There was also A Dog\u2019s Journeyabout a pit bull mix who gets lost, wanders round a bit and then comes home, and A Dog\u2019s Purpose about a dog that teaches people to be nicer to each other. I wondered if it might catch on over here and if I might be able to cash in with a book about my own dog, Herbert Hound. Though it might have to be quite short. I can\u2019t see much film tie-in potential in the story of how he had such a good time staying with our friends Kim and Sarah while we were away \u2013 they were happy to throw him a ball for hours on end, even though his retrieval success rate is only one in three \u2013 that he sulked for a week when he got back home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The dog: \u2018I hope they\u2019ve agreed a prenup.\u2019 Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nFriday\n\nIt also appears to be sod\u2019s law that I managed to miss one of England\u2019s greatest finishes to a Test match since 1981 and have come home to find the cricket team has reverted to playing as badly as it did before I left. Nor are Spurs doing much for my mental wellbeing. Last Sunday\u2019s north London Derby against Arsenal was more pain. Surrendering a two-goal lead and hanging on like grim death for a draw, only to miss a golden chance to steal the win right at the end, was 90 minutes of pure misery. Made worse by being hit on the shoulder by a plastic bottle that had been thrown by an Arsenal fan sitting above the away end. I complained to a steward but he just shrugged and said he hadn\u2019t seen anything. My observation that preventing these kinds of incidents was the whole reason he was there was met with a blank stare. Not so long ago I looked forward to sport as a release \u2013 time out from myself \u2013 but now the bit I increasingly enjoy the most is the anticipation before the game has started, and I\u2019m beginning to wonder if it\u2019s every bit as bad for my mental health as Brexit. I read a report recently that pessimists have a much shorter life expectancy than optimists. In which case, I suspect I am already on borrowed time.\n\nDigested week digested: Once, twice, three times a loser", "description": "As satire and reality collide I find it difficult to see the funny side of anything going on in Westminster", "authors": ["John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab021c6e7e4137293847f62df00779ebdce542d2/903_102_3909_2345/master/3909.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=659f33b68bb3bb3755ba932fd5c1e4b5", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
