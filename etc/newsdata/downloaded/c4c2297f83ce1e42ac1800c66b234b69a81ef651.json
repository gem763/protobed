Its customers are more conscious about the environmental impact of products they purchase, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hopefully an introduction to Floyd through Brooklinen, and vice versa,\u201d Mr. Hoff said.\n\nSpaces will start with model bedrooms, such as \u201cRelaxed Industrial,\u201d \u201cEarthy Minimalist\u201d and \u201cModern Glam.\u201d Brooklinen hopes to expand into dozens of room types, such as nurseries, bathrooms and living rooms, according to Mr. Fulop.\n\nBrooklinen is profitable, with revenue on track to approach $100 million this year, up from $60 million in 2018, Mr. Fulop said.\n\nSpaces could one day represent half of Brooklinen\u2019s business, said Mr. Fulop. Today it makes almost all of its money from selling its own branded products to customers, but generates some revenue by selling detergents from Laundress Inc. and blankets from Pendleton Woolen Mills Inc.\n\n\u201cOnce we have a marketplace that can expand into different rooms and different brands, it adds a whole new layer of value to the company,\u201d Mr. Fulop said.\n\nBest known for its sheet sets, Brooklinen has expanded into other luxury bedding and home products, including towels, candles and lounge wear. Today, Brooklinen offers 89 items for sale, primarily on its website but also through Amazon.com Inc. and the wedding registry website Zola Inc.\n\nThe company this year opened a pop-up retail store in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood, ahead of an initiative to establish 30 physical stores in the next three years.\n\nCustomers have demonstrated a willingness to buy new products through Brooklinen, Mr. Fulop said, adding that when the company has introduced new items, 60% of purchases made within the first two months were from existing customers.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at Sahil.Patel@wsj.com", "description": "The Brooklyn, N.Y.-based startup is introducing \u201cSpaces by Brooklinen,\u201d a digital store featuring three themed rooms stocked with Brooklinen wares plus more than 100 products from 12 outside brands.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119589/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
