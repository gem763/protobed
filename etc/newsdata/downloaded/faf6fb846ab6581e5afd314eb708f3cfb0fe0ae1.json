And they need it fast.\n\nWith news that U.S. rental office company WeWork \u2013 formally known as The We Company \u2013 looks set to delay its IPO, we can see just how dependent SoftBank supremo Masayoshi Son\u2019s empire was on this one exit to keep the Japanese company\u2019s hit machine ticking along.\n\nSoftBank Vision Fund has been a major investor in some of this year\u2019s most significant listings. Uber Technologies Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc. were among them. Both have fallen this quarter, dragging down the value of the Fund.\n\nThere is a pattern to how the Vision Fund keeps returns climbing. Buy in at a later round of a startup\u2019s funding, list the company a year or two later, and book the mark-to-market gains.\n\nSounds simple, except for the one-two punch that follows: SoftBank, like most pre-IPO investors, is generally locked in and can\u2019t cash out that profit for at least a year. Additionally, IPO shares have a tendency to perform badly in their first year. For SoftBank and the Vision Fund, that means quick gains turn to slow public-market losses that need to be booked every period, hurting returns in subsequent quarters.\n\nTo paper over these losses, the Fund can book gains by bringing its next hot offering to market. That means that as long as there\u2019s a healthy IPO each quarter, the pain from public-market declines can be squelched. So the model becomes: IPO gain, public-market losses, IPO gain. And around again.\n\nWith WeWork, however, the merry-go-round risks turning into musical chairs. The game needs IPOs on the floor or the music stops. Had WeWork gone public before Sept. 30, and at a healthy premium to the various prices SoftBank paid through its funding rounds, then such paper profits likely would have covered over losses caused by the 26% decline in Uber\u2019s shares so far this quarter and the 30% drop in those for Slack.\n\nAs Bloomberg\u2019 s Gillian Tan wrote earlier this month, SoftBank and its affiliates own around 29% of WeWork. Should the $47 billion valuation at which SoftBank most-recently bought in turn into the current whisper number of $15 billion, then SoftBank and the Fund could be set to lose as much as $9.28 billion right out of the gate.(4)\n\nThat would result in an unusual IPO loss, drag down the Fund, and ruin the quarterly model. So it makes sense that SoftBank wants to delay WeWork\u2019s IPO, at least until after Sept. 30. WeWork responded to reports of this delay by saying it expects to complete the IPO by the end of this year.\n\nAssuming that there\u2019s no other basis for revaluation, such as a new equity round, the Vision Fund can still contend that WeWork is worth $47 billion when it closes its books at the end of this month.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t solve the possibility of the Vision Fund posting a loss this quarter thanks to slides in Uber and Slack. One listed portfolio company, Ping An Good Doctor (aka Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co.), was up 39% in Hong Kong as of Tuesday morning, netting a gain of around $110 million to the Vision Fund. Others have fallen, including Guardant Health Inc. (-13%) and ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co. (-8.6%).\n\nI believe that this leaves SoftBank Vision Fund with little choice but to enact a two-pronged strategy. First, take a \u201cbig bath(3)\u201d for the September quarter and get the bad news behind it. Second, hurry along the IPOs of the other unicorns in its stable.\n\nByteDance, the hugely popular Chinese video content platform, is currently the world\u2019s most valuable startup at $75 billion, according to CB Insights. That\u2019s followed by Chinese ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing at $56 billion. I don\u2019t think either is ready to IPO in the next month or two, but there\u2019s always a chance ByteDance may decide to list before a slowdown in the Chinese economy starts to show up in its growth metrics.\n\nThere are also some smaller fruit about to ripen. South Korean e-commerce company Coupang and U.S. food delivery provider DoorDash Inc. could find favor among IPO investors. Southeast Asian transport and services startup Grab Holdings Inc. would also be very popular, but I sense they want to spend a little more time building the non-transport offerings before pitching an IPO. Then there is Son\u2019s plan to relist British semiconductor designer ARM Holding Plc, which would likely be a success because of its central role in the global technology sector.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- SoftBank Group Corp. and its Vision Fund\u00a0need\u00a0another win.
