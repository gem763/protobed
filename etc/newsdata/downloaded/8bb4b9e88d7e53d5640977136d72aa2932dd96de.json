Elijah Cummings.\n\n\u201cMy warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cI got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\u201d\n\nCummings died at Johns Hopkins Hospital at 2:45 a.m. Thursday morning as a result of \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d according to his staff.\n\nThe veteran lawmaker helped launch the impeachment effort in the House before his absence in the House in recent weeks prior to a medical procedure. As chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Cummings also launched several probes into President Trump and his family.\n\nIn July, Cummings exploded at Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan during a congressional hearing, accusing him of failing to take care of migrants apprehended while crossing into the United States.\n\nTrump responded by accusing the congressman of failing the \u201crat and rodent-infested\u201d city of Baltimore and his congressional district.\n\nCummings did not respond directly to Trump but implicitly criticized him in a follow-up speech at the National Press Club.\n\n\u201cThose in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language, and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nTrump and Cummings tried to work together in a bipartisan way to reduce drug prices in the early days of the Trump presidency. Cummings revealed in December 2017 that the president phoned the Baltimore lawmaker three times to discuss the issue.", "description": "President Donald Trump expressed condolences on Thursday in response to the death of Rep.
