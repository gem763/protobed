It\u2019s not been a surge, it\u2019s been slow and steady,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who was press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cShe moved up in the polls because a growing number of people see her as an authentic candidate with plans.\u201d\n\nMary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist, said: \u201cElizabeth Warren is a very methodical, disciplined candidate who has been able to inspire people with her plans, her message and her life story.\n\n\u201cShe talks to people in a way that everybody understands because she shared those problems too.\u201d\n\nAntonia Felix, who published a biography of Ms Warren last year, said that the Massachusetts senator told a compelling story. \u201cShe was not educated in the Ivy League, she is not a traditional East Coast liberal . . . she came up through the ranks on her own accomplishments.\u201d\n\nMs Warren\u2019s recounting of her unorthodox path from Oklahoma schoolgirl to 19-year-old college dropout to Harvard Law School professor has been a pillar of her stump speech.\n\nBut it has also opened her up to criticism. Last week, the conservative Washington Free Beacon website said there was no evidence to support Ms Warren\u2019s claims that she was sacked as a public school teacher in the early 1970s for being pregnant.\n\nThe senator stood her ground, saying on Twitter: \u201cThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u2014 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways,\u201d she added. \u201cWe can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Marsh said the accusations were unlikely to tarnish Ms Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cThere is not a woman who has not experienced that herself, or knows someone who has,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou can see how viscerally women responded to it,\u201d she added. \u201cWomen are not going to put up with the kind of coverage . . . the way that Hillary Clinton was treated . . . This election is too important, too serious and people are too worried about beating Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, political analysts say Ms Warren will probably face further criticism not only from the media, but also from fellow candidates, if she continues to poll ahead of the pack.\n\nStephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who served as deputy campaign manager for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 bid, said: \u201cIf you are second or third in the race, you can escape with little scrutiny, but as soon as you are on top that scrutiny begins. We are on the cusp of seeing that happen now.\u201d\n\nLast week, Michael Bennet, the centrist senator from Colorado who has failed to find traction in the polls, said Ms Warren would open herself up to attack on her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal in a general election if she was \u201cnot clear\u201d about its estimated $US31 trillion cost.\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Mr Biden made a dig at Ms Warren \u2014 whose campaign trail refrain is \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d \u2014 saying: \u201cWe are not electing a planner.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has vowed to revive his jibes against the senator, who he calls \u201cPocahontas\u201d because of her disputed claims to Native American ancestry, should she face him in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nBut Ms Marsh said Ms Warren had already fought off such attacks, both in her initial Senate race in Massachusetts against Scott Brown, and more recently at the start of her primary campaign.\n\n\u201cYes, she got off to a rough start in the beginning of her campaign because of it,\u201d Ms Marsh said. \u201cHowever, look how far she has come since then. The most dangerous candidate is somebody who goes into the barrel and comes out stronger \u2014 not weaker, stronger.\u201d\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Ms Warren\u2019s support among the left-leaning Democratic \u201cbase\u201d has grown steadily over the northern summer and into the autumn.
