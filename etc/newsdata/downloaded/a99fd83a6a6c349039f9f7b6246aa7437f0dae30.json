Roosevelt\u2019s traveling library.\n\nThe buzz: \u201cMoyes celebrates the power of reading in a terrific book that only reinforces that message,\u201d says critic Patty Rhule in a \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd review for USA TODAY.\n\n2. \u201cHow We Fight for Our Lives,\u201dby Saeed Jones (Simon & Schuster, nonfiction, on sale Oct. 8)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: The prize-winning poet bares his soul in this haunting coming-of-age memoir, which recounts the author\u2019s sexual awakening as a young, gay black man in Texas and the tumultuous relationships that shaped him.\n\nThe buzz: \u201cA memoir of coming to terms that\u2019s written with masterful control of both style and material,\u201d says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.\n\n3. \u201cGrand Union,\u201dby Zadie Smith (Penguin Press, fiction, on sale Oct. 8)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: The celebrated author publishes her first collection of short stories, including 11 never-before-published tales. It\u2019s a varied and modern collection, suffused with Smith\u2019s powers of observation and literary prowess.\n\nThe buzz: In a starred review, Publishers Weekly calls the story collection \u201csmart and bewitching.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cNinth House,\u201dby Leigh Bardugo (Flatiron, fiction, on sale Oct. 8)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: Bardugo\u2019s first fantasy novel for adults is set at Yale, where burnout Galaxy \u201cAlex\u201d Stern has been offered a free ride \u2013 due to her magical ability to see ghosts. In the hallowed hall of the Ivy League, Alex must confront the evils swirling beneath the deceiving surface of tradition.\n\nThe buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly says, \u201cFantasy readers, particularly those who love ghosts, will hungrily devour this novel.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cMovies (and Other Things),\u201d by Shea Serrano (Twelve, nonfiction, on sale Oct. 8)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: The pop-culture writer and author of \u201cThe Rap Year Book\u201d and \u201cBasketball (and Other Things)\u201d turns his attention to another of his loves: movies.
