I can't concentrate on my studies,\" says the politics student.\n\nThere are 22 private student blocks across the UK that have been delayed this term - almost a third of those being built, according to student housing charity Unipol.\n\nLack of scrutiny?\n\nEva Crossan Jory, of the National Union of Students, says she is \"extremely concerned at the significant rise\" in students being disrupted.\n\nBut the University of Portsmouth is also angry - because even though there might be an assumption that it has some link to the unfinished student flats, these are private developments over which the university has no control.\n\nImage caption Stanhope House for students in Portsmouth is still not ready for students to move in\n\nThe university's vice-chancellor, Graham Galbraith, says there is a serious lack of scrutiny about how the private student accommodation system operates.\n\n\"At the end of the day, those housing providers know that the universities will step in. So where does the responsibility for this lie? Because they seem to be able to walk away,\" he says.\n\nAnyone going through university towns and cities will have seen new blocks of student flats mushrooming skywards.\n\nImage caption Bilgesu says she is having to stay in a hotel room away from students and without access to wi-fi\n\nThese are often private investments, but the cash fuelling this building boom is public money - in the form of the maintenance loans to cover students' living costs.\n\nProf Galbraith says it seems extraordinary that billions of pounds of taxpayers' money should go into these private rental projects with so little accountability.\n\n\"There is no real control,\" he says, and he warns that new blocks can open without even a \"conversation\" with the university.\n\nHe also wants better consumer protection for students signing housing contracts, arguing that some \"arrangements are incredibly one-sided\".\n\nUnregulated\n\nThis autumn there have been reports of unfinished flats in locations from Portsmouth to Swansea, Lincoln to Liverpool. In Bristol, delays have meant students being put up temporarily in Wales.\n\nBut it's not clear who might intervene.\n\nImage caption Students were expecting to move into this building in Portsmouth for the new term\n\nUniversities UK says its code of conduct applies only to university-owned housing - which means any private student developments will not be covered.\n\nThe higher-education regulator, the Office for Students, says it \"doesn't have powers to regulate private accommodation providers\".\n\nPortsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan asked a parliamentary question about \"safeguards for students affected by properties not being built in time\".\n\nBut universities minister Chris Skidmore said universities were autonomous and that \"government plays no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation\".\n\nFirst day, no accommodation\n\nIn Portsmouth, Bilgesu is another student unable to move into the new Stanhope House student building.\n\nShe is in a hotel with no free wi-fi, where she feels unable to get on with her degree course and isolated from student life.\n\n\"It's just so far away from the student environment,\" says the biomedical science student.\n\nImage caption Alex, an overseas student, found out that he had no accommodation when he was on his way to the UK\n\nAlex, an international student from the Netherlands, found out about the accommodation not being ready just as he was travelling to the UK.\n\nHe was coming to a new country and a new city for the first time - and had nowhere to go, so booked himself into a hotel at his own expense.\n\n\"I didn't know anything about this city, I couldn't make any friends. It was hard for the first week,\" says Alex, who was then found a room by the university.\n\nHe says he was even more taken aback when \"on the day they told people they can't move in, they were asking for money from them\".\n\n\"I feel like students are really easy to exploit. I just came here expecting the building to be ready, I'm trusting what I saw on the website.\"\n\nCompensation\n\nDestiny says the disruption has meant she can't get the term started. \"I can't organise my books. It's affecting my studies,\" she says.\n\nThe students are unimpressed by a compensation offer of \u00a3150 - less than they are still being charged for a week's rent.\n\nImage caption Student union president Helena Schofield says starting university is stressful enough without problems over housing\n\nThe students' union and university officials have been trying to help students who have found themselves unable to move in.\n\nUnion president Helena Schofield says the link between housing and students' mental health is underestimated.\n\nStarting at university can be an emotional time - and such uncertainty about accommodation, and being away from other students, can only add to the stress.\n\nUnreserved apologies\n\nThe private housing company behind Stanhope House, Prime Student Living, says it has \"unreservedly apologised to students\".\n\nImage caption The University of Portsmouth has been trying to help students caught out by the non-completion of accommodation\n\nBut it blames its building contractor for a lack of advance warning of the failure to open on time and says finding alternative accommodation was made an \"immediate priority\".\n\nThe spokesman said the company was \"disappointed to hear that the university does not consider that we have communicated effectively to them\".\n\n\"We believe that we have done everything possible to mitigate the impact for those affected in the time available,\" said the Prime Student Living spokesman.\n\n\"We will continue to do all we can to get students into the building as an urgent priority.\"", "description": "There are 22 uncompleted student housing blocks, prompting complaints of a lack of official scrutiny.", "authors": ["Sean Coughlan", "Bbc News Family", "Education Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/30AA/production/_109085421_student3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
