He has done plenty of work and plenty of schooling, and we are anxiously looking forward to it,\" said O'Keeffe.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\n\"The trip is probably a touch on the sharp side for him, but he will enjoy the track and the ground is fine.\n\n\"What we want to see from him tomorrow, first and foremost, is a good round of jumping.\n\n\"We know that he is not at his peak yet and hopefully that will come later on in the season, but we want to see lots of promise and aptitude for chasing, which is what we see at home.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nNow, resident Mirror tipster David Yates (Newsboy) has taken his picks of the runners and riders.\n\nTake a look at his tips below and sharpen those betting pencils - but please remember to always gamble responsibly.\n\nBATH\n\n1.40 OUR OYSTERCATCHER\n\n2.10 AMARILLO STAR (NB)\n\n2.45 STAG HORN\n\n3.20 SAPA INCA\n\n3.50 QUEL DESTIN\n\n4.25 GAMESTERS ICON\n\n4.55 MANUCCI (NAP)\n\n\n\nWETHERBY\n\n1.50 ZEB SPIRIT\n\n2.20 HIGHWAY TO SUCCESS\n\n2.55 SAM SPINNER\n\n3.30 JATILUWIH\n\n4.00 CRIEVEHILL\n\n4.35 VICTARION\n\n5.05 THEFLYINGPORTRAIT\n\n5.35 LUCKY LOVER BOY\n\nNOTTINGHAM\n\n1.55 ZEGALO\n\n2.30 SO I TOLD YOU\n\n3.05 SHE\u2019S A UNICORN\n\n3.40 GLOBAL GIFT\n\n4.10 SERM0N\n\n4.45 FANTASY KEEPER\n\n5.15 VALENTINO SUNRISE\n\nKEMPTON\n\n4.40 TWILIGHTING\n\n5.10 QUIET WORD\n\n5.40 CAT ROYALE\n\n6.10 COBBER KAIN\n\n6.40 KHUZAAM\n\n7.10 SONNET ROSE\n\n7.40 GARTH ROCKETT\n\n8.10 COTTINGHAM\n\nSOUTHWELL\n\n5.25 POETA BRASILEIRO\n\n5.55 BORN TO DESTROY\n\n6.25 BEE MACHINE\n\n6.55 CROSSE FIRE\n\n7.25 GREAT SUSPENSE\n\n7.55 MONGOLIA\n\n8.25 BREAK THE SILENCE", "description": "Newsboy has made his picks ahead of Wednesday's meetings", "authors": ["David Yates", "Image", "Getty Images Europe", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19010606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bath-Races.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
