That offering covers a basket of 58 low-market cap cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe timing of the DRGN-PERP launch probably couldn\u2019t have been better, coming days after Chinese President Xi Jinping urged his country to \u201cseize the opportunity\u201d afforded by blockchain technology and proposed adoption across a wide range of sectors.\n\nRelated: Ex-Official Trolls Libra, Says China Likely to Issue Digital Currency First\n\nChinese blockchain and tech stocks saw a massive spike in interest after Xi\u2019s comments, prompting authorities to urge investors to avoid speculative behavior.\n\n\u201cChina recently voiced support for the blockchain industry, causing a bunch of cryptocurrencies developed there to skyrocket in price and driving intense user interest in Chinese cryptocurrency projects,\u201d Bankman-Fried said.\n\nChinese dragon image via Shutterstock\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "Derivatives exchange FTX has launched an index of eight popular Chinese cryptocurrencies, as well as futures offering exposure to the basket.", "authors": ["Daniel Palmer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cWA.beJCk95rHt4csQueOg--~B/aD04MzI7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/adea886a8753c6460eb8ab7822097021", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
