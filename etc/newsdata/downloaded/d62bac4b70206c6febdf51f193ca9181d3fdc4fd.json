A similar petition on change.org received over 30,000 supporters before it was wound up.\n\n\"I didn't realise racism on that level existed any more,\" Tom said.\n\n\"It makes you think terrible things. It's the kind of comments where if you heard them in the street you would do something.\"\n\nAshton was particularly shaken by some of the language.\n\n\"It even had her questioning stupid stuff like whether she's good enough for me because of our races,\" said Tom.\n\nTom does not know if the petition will be successful due to US laws.\n\nA number of the site's users have responded to the news of the petition.\n\n(Image: The Sick Children's Trust / SWNS)\n\nOne commented: \"It only took the ****** about 2 years to find this thread. I look at it as a lost 22 months of free advertising for the site. But now we have free advertising.\"\n\nTom is aware that launching a petition will bring attention to a website that deserves none but he takes the view that it will be overwhelmingly negative attention.He explained: \"To be honest the way I see it is the opposite, in respect of he may think it's good publicity but it's less than 24 hours into the petition and we've had over 600 people sign up.\n\n\"For every one racist person who finds out about the site and likes it, there will be 1,000 who think it's disgusting.\n\n\"I am even going as far as emailing Boris Johnson .\"\n\n(Image: Tom Greenwood)\n\nAs far as Albie goes, he is now a happy two-year-old and totally unaware of the vile online abuse directed towards his family.\n\nTom and Ashton, who are currently trying for another child, ended their petition with a plea to protect young people from racism.\n\nIt reads: \"Let\u2019s not let our children grow up to see this despicable and evil side of the world.\n\n\"It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair.\"\n\nView the petition here .", "description": "Albie's dad Tom Greenwood was called a \"race traitor\" in the vile forum and is now campaigning for it to be removed", "authors": ["Ben Abbiss", "Image", "Tom Greenwood", "The Sick Children'S Trust", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20731362.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RHR_HUD_251019albie2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
