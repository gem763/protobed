All six offenses were committed in the 1970s and 1980s. He was first jailed in 1999 when he admitted to possessing images of child abuse.\n\nSpeaking to the LA Times in an interview published Friday, the label Snapper Music, which owns Glitter's songs, said that the 75-year old \"does not get paid \u2014 we've had no contact with him.\"\n\nIn the same report, Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) also said it was not paying music royalties to Glitter.\n\n\"Gary Glitter's publishing interest in the copyright of his songs is owned by UMPG and other parties, therefore UMPG does not pay him any royalties or other considerations,\" the LA Times reported, citing a representative from the publishing group.\n\nIn the U.S., rights to the songwriting of \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" belong to UMPG, which represents Glitter, and BMG, which represents Mike Leander.\n\nThe 1972 hit was co-written by Glitter and Leander. It plays for approximately two minutes as Joaquin Phoenix, who has received rave reviews for his portrayal of the eponymous villain in the movie, dances down a long flight of steps.\n\nSnapper Music and UMPG were not immediately available for comment when contacted independently by CNBC on Tuesday.\n\n\"Joker\" smashed box-office records in its opening weekend earlier this month, with Warner Bros. hauling in $93.5 million in the U.S. alone. It marked the highest debut for a film released in October in cinematic history.\n\nThe film, directed by Todd Phillips, has reportedly earned nearly $550 million worldwide in two weeks.", "description": "The inclusion of Glitter's 1972 hit \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" in the R-rated comic book film had sparked an intense backlash from moviegoers.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106167918-1570457342166gettyimages-462775308.jpeg?v=1570457363", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
