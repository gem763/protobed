Hong) Associated Press\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Chinese officials wanted Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to be fired for his tweet supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and the league emphatically dismissed the request.\n\nSilver also said that the league is already feeling \"substantial\" financial losses because of the Chinese reaction to Morey's deleted tweet.\n\n\"Obviously, we made clear that we were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\" Silver said Thursday during an appearance at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York. \"We said, 'There's no chance that's happening. There's no chance we'll even discipline him.'\"\n\nThe league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, has been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression.\n\n\"We wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\" Silver said. \"We wanted to make sure everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\"\n\nThe Rockets were of massive interest in China, largely because of Yao Ming \u2014 the Chinese star who spent his entire NBA career in Houston. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its ties to the Rockets because of the tweet.\n\nMorey has not commented publicly since a pair of tweets on Oct. 6 attempting to clarify his position.\n\n\"I understand there is a point of view from some that we shouldn't be in business at all in China, and I'd say from an intellectual standpoint, that's fair \u2014 not getting into whether the tweet or the response to it,\" Silver said.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV did not air the two NBA preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets last week. Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion deal to stream NBA games in China over the next five years, has also stopped showing Rockets games but has not totally dropped all NBA content.\n\n\"The losses have already been substantial,\" Silver said. \"Our games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we'll see what happens next.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: and", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Chinese officials wanted Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to be fired for his tweet supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and the league emphatically dismissed the request.", "authors": ["Tim Reynolds", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
