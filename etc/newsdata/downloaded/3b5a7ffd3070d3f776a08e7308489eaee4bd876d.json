In a statement at the time bosses said: \u201cWhile Ms Munchetty was entitled to give a personal response to the phrase \u2018go back to your own country\u2019 as it was rooted in her own experience, overall her comments went beyond what the guidelines allow for.\u201d\n\nBBC journalists quickly hit out at the decision. Sangita Myska said that \u201cright now, there is a lot of bewilderment among BAME staff\u201d, while Carrie Gracie, who resigned as China editor in 2018 over an equal pay dispute, tweeted: \u201cUnease among #BBC journalists for whom \u2018go back\u2019 = racist. If power trumps or bends meaning then no point in journalism, just print propaganda.\n\n\u201cThere is no #BBC journalism worth the name without #BBC values. Accountability is one. Explain @BBCNaga reprimand please.\u201d\n\nGabriel Gatehouse, the Newsnight international editor, tweeted: \u201cThis is mad. I propose a little thought experiment: if a BBC presenter suggested on air that a black Brit should \u201cgo back to where they came from\u201d and viewers complained the remark was racist, would the BBC uphold such a complaint? One would hope so. Ergo...?\u201d\n\nPresenter Babita Sharma said: \u201cI don\u2019t get this at all. But I do get @BBCNaga who always tells it like it is & that\u2019s why she\u2019s a top journalist.\u201d And Robin Lustig, a former BBC radio broadcaster, said: \u201cI always try to defend the BBC whenever I can, but I cannot support this adjudication. It is both wrong and immensely damaging.\u201d\n\nIn an email to The Independent, the BBC refused to say whether it planned to review its decision or apologise to Ms Munchetty.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She understandably feels strongly on this issue and there was nothing wrong with her talking about her own experiences of racism.\n\n\u201cHowever, our editorial guidelines do not allow for journalists to then give their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so \u2013 in this case President Trump \u2013 and it was for this reason that the complaint was partially upheld. Those judgments are for the audience to make.\u201d\n\nHigh-profile presenters from outside the corporation\u2019s news arm also criticised the complaint unit\u2019s decision. Trevor Nelson, the DJ, said he saw nothing wrong with \u201cspeaking your truth\u201d. He added: \u201cEvery person of colour knows exactly what that phrase \u2018go back home\u2019 means. Unless you\u2019ve experienced it, it\u2019s hard to truly understand.\u201d\n\nAnd Greg James, the Radio 1 breakfast presenter, said: \u201cI think my issue with it is that you have to make sure people who bravely say things that highlight how vulnerable they\u2019ve felt are looked after by the guidelines as well.\u201d", "description": "BBC workers have lashed out at bosses over their decision to reprimand Naga Munchetty for calling Donald Trump racist.
