Evidently, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai volunteered for the duty, as did former militia commander (as Reuters would have it) or mujaheddin warlord (as the New York Times once called him) Ismail Khan.\n\n\u201cI hope this dialogue opens the way to further meetings through which we can achieve a peaceful solution,\u201d Khan said.\n\nThe Taliban has generally refused to deal with the government in Kabul, which it characterizes as a puppet of the United States. Taliban representatives indicated they would only be willing to tolerate the presence of \u201clower-level officials\u201d at the Chinese talks.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said on Monday that special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was just able to launch a new round of talks between the U.N., European Union, and NATO, and planned to meet soon with Russian and Chinese officials to \u201cdiscuss shared interests in seeing the war in Afghanistan come to an end.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese responded angrily in September to U.S. accusations that Beijing is interested in exploiting Afghan territory for its Belt and Road Initiative, but has done nothing \u201csubstantial\u201d to assist with economic development or political stability.\n\n\u201cShe is a little ignorant about what China\u2019s cooperation with Afghanistan is,\u201d Chinese ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing sniffed in response to criticism from U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia Alice Wells.\n\nYao touted Kabul\u2019s signature on a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on Belt and Road, adding \u201cthe only problem is that the security situation poses a little challenge, so that is why China and Pakistan and all the regional countries, we are working so hard trying to support or facilitate peace in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nNBC News reported on Monday that the Pentagon is drawing up plans for a swift American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan if President Donald Trump orders something along the lines of his Syrian pullout.\n\nThis raises the possibility of handing the Afghan quagmire off to China, which has a small and rough land border with Afghanistan, clearly stated interests in the country, and far fewer qualms about trampling on civilian human rights to subdue troublesome insurgencies. Perhaps the upcoming China-sponsored talks will provide an opportunity for both the savage Taliban and fractious, corruption-plagued Kabul government to focus their minds on the unpleasant alternatives to reaching an agreement with the United States.", "description": "The Chinese government is trying to organize peace talks between rival factions in Afghanistan, including the Taliban.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Afghanistan-Taliban-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
