Oracle didn't disclose the cause of death and hadn't said what specific issues the CEO was facing when he took leave.\n\nThe death leaves Safra Catz as Oracle's sole CEO. Since September 2014 Oracle has had an unusual leadership structure in which Mr. Hurd and Ms. Catz shared the CEO title, while co-founder Larry Ellison is chairman and technology chief.\n\nMr. Ellison said, \"Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle.\"\n\nSweeping changes in the way businesses manage their data in recent years have meant Oracle and other legacy information-technology providers have struggled to maintain their dominant position. Oracle's market capitalization has fallen 2.4% since the announcement that Mr. Hurd would became CEO alongside Ms. Catz. International Business Machines Corp.'s market cap is down around 38% and Microsoft's is up around 175% over the same time.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Oracle said Mr. Hurd was taking medical leave. Changes in his appearance had prompted questions about his health from analysts and journalists as far back as last autumn. At the time, an Oracle spokesman said his health was fine and the company had nothing to disclose about it.\n\nOracle Friday didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nMr. Hurd's death isn't like to lead to major changes at Oracle, Nomura analyst Chris Eberle said, given the large involvement Mr. Ellison has always had in setting the company's direction as executive chairman and chief technology officer.\n\n\"Larry believes a dual-CEO structure is needed for the company, so he wants to stay with that structure,\" Mr. Eberle said. \"There will be someone elevated from within, I think.\"\n\nOracle didn't respond to request for comment on whether the company would add a second CEO alongside Ms. Catz.\n\nMr. Hurd, who was born in New York City, joined Oracle in 2010 after resigning his role as Hewlett Packard CEO on Aug. 6 that year. The computer maker's board had investigated Mr. Hurd over his relationship with a female contractor. Though the board found Mr. Hurd didn't violate company's policy regarding sexual-harassment, it found he violated company standards by submitting inaccurate expense reports to conceal the relationship.\n\nIn a statement at the time, Mr. Hurd said that \"there were instances in which I did not live up to the standards and principles of trust, respect and integrity that I have espoused at H-P and which have guided me throughout my career.\" A spokesman for Mr. Hurd said later that there was nothing untoward or improper about Mr. Hurd's relationship with the contractor.\n\nAt H-P, he reorganized the company and pledged to eliminate about 10% of its global workforce. Those moves helped propel the company, at the time, ahead of rivals such as Dell and IBM.\n\nAfter leaving H-P, he quickly re-emerged at Oracle, hired by Mr. Ellison for the role. The two were tennis buddies and Mr. Ellison had spoken out against H-P's board for pushing out the CEO.\n\nWhen Mr. Ellison became Oracle's executive chairman, Mr. Hurd became CEO in 2014 alongside Ms. Catz. Mr. Hurd helped move Oracle to more aggressively pursue cloud-computing deals -- a booming field in which the company had fallen behind rivals.\n\nMr. Hurd closely oversaw Oracle's sales structure as the company battled to maintain its position as a large force in the software-as-a-service market, where it is the No. 3, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Mr. Hurd also had been closely involved in Oracle's bid to win customers in the booming field of cloud-computing to catch up with Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, that dominate market. Although Oracle's cloud efforts have gained pace in recent years, the company remains far behind the two cloud giants.\n\nPrior to joining H-P in 2005, where he replaced CEO Carly Fiorina after she was fired, Mr. Hurd spent 25 years working his way up the sales and marketing ranks at NCR, previously known as National Cash Register Co. He started out as a junior salesman, was named president in 2001 and CEO two years later.\n\nWhen he took over NCR, it was struggling, coming off a year when it posted a loss of $220 million. He quickly moved to expand NCR's reach and cut costs. Under Mr. Hurd, NCR fired employees, some who had spent their entire career there.\n\nMr. Hurd graduated with a B.A. in management from Baylor University in 1979. He joined his alma mater's board of regents in 2014. He helped fund the university's tennis facilities, where he played as a student, which was later renamed after Mr. Hurd.\n\nWhile still at NCR, he co-authored a book with then CEO Lars Nyberg on how people and companies can use data information to improve business. Mr Hurd made Barron's best CEO list in 2008 while at H-P.\n\nMr. Hurd married his wife Paula, who also worked at NCR, in 1990. They have two daughters.\n\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 18, 2019 16:12 ET (20:12 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
