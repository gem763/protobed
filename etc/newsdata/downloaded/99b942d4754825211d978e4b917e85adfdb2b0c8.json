REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe statement was prefaced by an introduction reading, \u201cThere have been many false narratives in the media regarding Colin, we believe it is important to set the record straight, again. Nothing below is up for interpretation or debate, it\u2019s the truth and nothing else.\u201d\n\nAmong the details, the statement said no team has offered Kaepernick a job or brought him in for a workout since the 2016 season. It noted that the Seattle Seahawks brought Kaepernick in for a visit, but did not work him out, and that no other team has interviewed or visited with the quarterback \u201cdespite other false statements in the media to the contrary.\u201d\n\nKaepernick\u2019s representatives said their client has been working out five days a week for three years and has not demanded a specific salary. They said they have reached out to all 32 teams \u201cwith little to no response from teams about an opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 25 years, I have never seen anything like it,\u201d the statement added.\n\nKaepernick, 31, opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers after the 2016 season \u2014 during which he began kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice \u2014 and has not played since.\n\nRegarding Kaepernick\u2019s departure from the 49ers, the statement said general manager John Lynch told Kaepernick he would be released if he did not opt out, citing public comments from Lynch at the time.\n\nThe statement went on to list Kaepernick\u2019s statistics from 2016 and during his career as evidence of his ability to play in the NFL.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is difficult to think of another young player in NFL history with statistics and character as impressive as Colin\u2019s not being given an opportunity to earn a spot on an NFL roster after what he has accomplished,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nKaepernick filed a collusion grievance against the NFL in October 2017, and the case \u2014 along with another collusion grievance by former teammate Eric Reid \u2014 was settled in February 2019. The settlement, which was confidential, was later reported to be worth less than $10 million.\n\nReid signed with the Carolina Panthers last fall and then signed an extension after the season. He tweeted his support for Kaepernick along with a copy of the statement on Thursday, writing, \u201cPlease read this!! Don\u2019t believe the lies being told about my brother.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Representatives for quarterback Colin Kaepernick released a two-page statement on Thursday \"to address the false narratives\" regarding their client and his efforts to join an NFL team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439481810&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A00H", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
