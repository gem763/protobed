She has a stage name that she said the music industry coaxed her to adopt. She has a fashion shtick so well-defined that people can go as her for Halloween. She writes lyrics in a style that makes it seem like she wormholed from an early \u201970s LSD cult and then tried to learn modern slang from a Rihanna song. Her defenders have always said that it shouldn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s artificial, as all great pop musicians are. But it\u2019s clear now that that\u2019s not actually how she wants to be defended: She rejects the premise of the entire conversation.\n\n* * *\n\nIn 2013, an old song by Lana Del Rey leaked, and it was a doozie: a diss track against Lady Gaga. Before either woman had become famous, both had played in New York City nightlife circuits. It appeared they were friends, but the Del Rey song, \u201cSo Legit,\u201d seemed to blast Gaga as talentless and fake. \u201cYou\u2019re looking like a man, you\u2019re talking like a baby,\u201d Del Rey sang, airing some very-common-in-2009 idiocies directed at Gaga. \u201cHow the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy.\u201d\n\nThe notion of a divide between Del Rey and Gaga\u2014both of whom have grappled with charges of inauthenticity over the years\u2014is instructive. Back at the start of her career, Gaga entranced the press as a shapeshifting cartoon creature who gave sassy-cryptic interviews. There was no doubting that the \u201cfame monster\u201d Gaga was an entertaining fabulation, even though she\u2019d go around saying things like, \u201cThe largest misconception is that Lady Gaga is a persona or a character. I\u2019m not\u2014even my mother calls me Gaga. I am 150,000 percent Lady Gaga every day.\u201d Such statements could be brushed off as method acting. After all, her obvious predecessors\u2014Madonna, Prince\u2014often didn\u2019t break character in their early days. David Bowie held funerals for his personas once he was ready to move on from them.\n\nMove on, Gaga did. After pushing her couture and her sonic bombast ever more outlandishly through 2013\u2019s Artpop, she began an act of striptease, with pared-back albums and a documentary that purported to show the \u201creal\u201d her. She talks now about Gaga as, yes, a persona, something outside of herself. \u201cIt is a bit of a creation,\u201d she said in 2016. \u201cBut it\u2019s other people that have created [it] through what I\u2019ve made; their perception of what Gaga is, is a separate entity from me.\u201d But the persona isn\u2019t gone: See all of her high-concept runway moments promoting A Star Is Born (the showtunes-singing Italian American family girl we see in latter-day Gaga projects is a performance, too). In taking on that movie role, Gaga underlined the idea that she, like her character, Ally, built up a persona that she could then remove at will.\n\nDel Rey arrived at fame in 2012, and she seemed both out of time and perfectly timed. Just as Instagram\u2019s nostalgic filters and the bricolage identity-curation platforms like Pinterest were catching on, here was someone gluing together disparate references using a Super 8 aesthetic. Her music combined Golden Hollywood strings with hip-hop skittering, which fit the lyrics of someone who called herself \u201cgangster Nancy Sinatra.\u201d If this was \u201cpop,\u201d it was also weird. The music unfolded too slowly to fit with the untz-untz trends that Gaga led. Del Rey was out of step in a deeper way, too: her politics.", "description": "It\u2019s preposterous for Lana Del Rey and other musicians to deny that they\u2019re playing characters.
