He was a Democrat during the entire G.W. Bush presidency. In fact, he switched parties six times in 25 years: He was a registered member of the Democratic Party until 1987, then the Republican Party from 1987 until 1999, then the Reform Party from 1999 until 2001, then the Democratic Party again from 2001 until 2009, then the Republican Party again from 2009 until 2011, then an Independent from 2011 until 2012, then the Republican Party for third time since 2012. He would throw the Republican Party, and the nation, under the bus in a heartbeat if he thought it would benefit him personally.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
