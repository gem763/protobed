The residences were designed so that each would have balconies, plus amenities from hotel-like valet services to a rooftop pool, lounge and gym.\n\nThe hotel is being developed by Hard Rock International with local real estate development and management business Kailas Companies through a Deleware-registered limited liability corporation called 1031 Canal Development, property records show. Records kept by the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office show the business is in good standing, having last filed a report in June.\n\nThe project has been in the works for more than a decade. It drew controversy in 2011 when New Orleans officials voted to give then-developer Praveen Kailas zoning waivers for extra height beyond what was allowed in the area, NOLA.com reported. The project was delayed when Kailas was sentenced to prison for overbilling a government program, and another family member took over.\n\nThe previous building on the site was demolished in 2015, according to the report.\n\nThe new structure was designed in 2010 by Harry Baker Smith Architects II, which has also worked on projects such as the Trump Tower New Orleans and Hilton New Orleans.\n\nConstruction didn't begin until 2018, even though Hard Rock had originally planned to open the hotel in the spring of this year. Before the collapse, the developers had said it would open in May 2020.\n\nThe 40,448-square-foot property has an assessed value of more than $4 million. Parish records show that ownership of the site has passed between LLCs six times in the past decade, including four times in 2017 for $0.\n\nLocal affiliate FOX 8 reported this week that crews were hoisting and installing the rooftop pool starting Thursday.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what caused the collapse Saturday morning, which New Orleans Fire Superintendent Timothy McConnell said encompassed the top six to eight floors.\n\nIn addition to the reported death, two people were still missing, officials said. Another 19 people were driven to area hospitals for treatment.\n\nMcConnell said the building was still \u201cvery unstable\u201d and there was a risk that more of it might collapse and a crane might fall.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "This was not the development's first setback.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/hard-rock-2-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
