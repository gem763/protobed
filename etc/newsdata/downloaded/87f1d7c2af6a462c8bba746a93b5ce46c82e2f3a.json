Kelly collaboration missing from Lady Gaga's re-release of 'Artpop'", "language": "en", "text": "Lady Gaga is re-releasing the artist\u2019s third studio album next month, 2013\u2019s \u201cArtpop,\u201d albeit seemingly without the record\u2019s only tune to feature disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly.\n\nOnline retailers taking advance orders for the record do not list the track, \u201cDo What U Want (With My Body),\u201d as among those included on the album, NME first reported Tuesday.\n\nThe song is the only tune on the original Artpop record to feature Robert Sylvester Kelly, better known as R. Kelly, and the only one omitted from the new version\u2019s track listing, according to pre-order pages on both Amazon and HMV.\n\nMr. Kelly, a 52-year-old Grammy Award winner, was indicted in 2002 on child pornography charges but was ultimately acquitted. He was widely shunned by fellow artists following the release in January of a docu-series that depicted him as a serial sexual predator, \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d and he was jailed on related charges several weeks later.\n\nHe has since been charged with a string of federal sex offenses and remains in custody pending trial. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLady Gaga, a fellow Grammy winner born Stefani Germanotta, denounced Mr. Kelly after the release of the series and subsequently had digital versions of the song scrubbed from online streaming services.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nThe newest version of \u201cArtpop\u201d is available on CD and vinyl starting Nov. 11, a little more than six years since the original record\u2019s release.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
