When we finally got down, we just got our money back.\n\n\u201cSt John\u2019s Ambulance was called, but I didn\u2019t get checked over or anything like that.\u201d\n\nDespite the ordeal, Ellie plans to return to the fair.\n\n\u201cIt has not put me off going at all, and I think next year I will still go on the Air Maxx,\u201d she said.\n\nHull Fair is Europe's largest travelling fairs and dates back to the 13th century.", "description": "Ellie Middleton found herself in a precarious position when the Air Maxx ride at Hull Fair got stuck", "authors": ["Phil Winter", "Milo Boyd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470693.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2413JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
