In fact, OAN has taken no money outside the Herring family whatsoever. None of OAN\u2019s content comes from the Russian government.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Drops to Fifth Place in July Cable News Ratings\n\nThe network also claims that the comment was made in retaliation to OAN for presenting \u201ca conservative viewpoint\u201d and further pointed to how \u201cComcast refuses to carry OAN because it counters the liberal message of MSNBC.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead original story Right-Wing OAN Network Files $10 Million Defamation Suit Against Rachel Maddow, MSNBC At TheWrap", "description": "The One America News Network, a right-wing cable news channel, filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, and parent companies Comcast and NBCUniversal, for a statement the host made on a July 22 episode of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201dOAN is a pro-Trump, conservative media network", "authors": ["J.
