A person familiar with the matter said that there were 250 of these so-called Named Accounts, with each one getting a dedicated sales team, as well as a customer engineer to help advise on integrating Google's technology.\n\nIt came as Google Cloud disclosed that it brings in $8 billion in revenue every year, even as Kurian is tasked with helping the company close bigger deals to catch up with the market-leading Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nBefore Kurian came to Google, he was a rising star at Oracle \u2014 and this Named Accounts program is very similar to how Oracle approaches sales, with dedicated teams under a mandate of building relationships with top customers.\n\nSources also said Google Cloud has created a new position, called \"account director,\" with higher compensation packages, specifically to handle these Named Accounts. These account directors are expected to have deep expertise in specific industries, like finance, healthcare, or retail.\n\nAccording to a Google Cloud job posting from August for \"Key Account Director / Executive, Google Cloud\" \u2014 which our sources say is a role to handle Named Accounts \u2014 it's looking for people with at least 15 years of \"quota carrying software sales and strategic account management\" for enterprises. Preferably, it's looking for people with 20 years of experience.\n\nPeople hired for this role will \"serve as the senior executive selling to the most strategic enterprises.\" This includes building relationships with CEOs and executives at large companies to help them understand what their company needs and how they can use Google Cloud.\n\nMoving up the ladder\n\nThis strategy was first announced in June, around the same time that Google Cloud made changes to the ways it compensates salespeople. Effective July 1, Google Cloud moved to a bonus-driven compensation method, similar to legacy enterprise companies like Oracle and SAP.\n\nRead more: Google Cloud has changed how it pays its salespeople, ripping a page out of the Oracle playbook\n\nThis particular change isn't sitting especially well with everybody, according to two sources: These new account directors are making more money than those who have been doing similar jobs at Google Cloud, these employees said, even if they have the same level of experience with handling large companies.\n\nThis is further complicated by how Google ranks and compensates its employees. Most Google Cloud sales employees are at level 5 or level 6 (that's \"L5\" or \"L6\" in Google parlance). Managers and other senior salespeople are ranked at L7. However, these new account directors, tasked to a single company each, are ranked L8 \u2014 a distinction usually reserved for directors responsible for entire geographic regions, one source said.\n\nGoogle Cloud employees were told that they were eligible to apply for these lucrative, high-ranking account-director positions, but they've most often gone to outside hires brought in from other companies. They said that was because Google policy made it difficult for an L6 salesperson, even one with the appropriate experience, to jump up two ranks to the new L8 account-director position.\n\n'Biased' toward Oracle\n\nThe sources also said Google Cloud has altered the interview process, to meet Pichai's stated goal of accelerating sales hiring.\n\nHowever, they also said that they felt like Google Cloud's hiring process has become \"biased\" toward former Oracle employees, as one put it.\n\nTo their point, at least five of Google Cloud's new leadership hires have worked at Oracle: Eduardo Lopez, the Latin American sales president; Hamidou Dia, the customer-engineering vice president; Saintley Wong, the global-business-practices vice president; Bob Allison, the financial-services sales head; and David Ooley, the communications sales head, all came from the database giant.\n\nUltimately, one source said that now was the best time for outsiders to get hired for a sales role at Google Cloud. For employees within the company, though, it could still take around two years to move up a level, the source said, meaning that meaningful advancement for insiders is harder than it sounds.\n\nGoogle declined to comment but pointed Business Insider toward Pichai's remarks on growing the sales force at the time of the last earnings call: \"We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.\"\n\nDo you work at Google Cloud?
