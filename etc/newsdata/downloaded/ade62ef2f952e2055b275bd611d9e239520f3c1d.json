Total revenue for the quarter was $5.55 billion, it said.\n\nAnalysts were expecting revenue of $5.62 billion, according to Bloomberg. The airline had to remove 36 Boeing 737 Max aircraft from service during its peak summer months of operation after the model suffered two fatal crashes within five months.\n\n\u201cThe grounding is preventing us from realizing our full potential,\u201d Calin Rovinescu, president and CEO of Air Canada, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment rose $121 million or 9 per cent from the year earlier period to $1.472 billion as operating income rose to $956 million from $923 million in the third quarter of 2018, Air Canada said.\n\nRovinescu said the record revenue and higher earnings \u201care even more meaningful given that we achieved them despite the serious disruption to our operations and to our cost structure created by the Boeing 737 MAX grounding.\u201d\n\nAir Canada said it expects to return its Boeing 737 Max planes to service by Feb. 14. Meantime, it has leased two Airbus A330 planes to ensure sufficient capacity over the winter, Rovincescu said.\n\nThe company kept its full-year guidance issued in February of an earnings margin of 19 per cent, return on invested capital of 15.5 per cent to 16 per cent and its free cash flow estimate of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.\n\n\u201cI nonetheless remain confident that if regulators unground the aircraft near-term, our on-going transformation will quickly regain its previous trajectory,\u201d Rovinescu said. \u201cFor this reason, we have chosen at this time not to adjust our long-term financial targets.\u201d", "description": "The grounding of 36 aircraft \u2018is preventing us from realizing our full potential\u2019 \u2014 CEO", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/air-canada-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
