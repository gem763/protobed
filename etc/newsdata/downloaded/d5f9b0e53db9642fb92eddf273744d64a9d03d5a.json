Devin Nunes and scrutiny as part of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nThe firm played an important role in two meetings in Trump Tower in June 2016 and January 2017 that featured in recent high-profile reports by special counsel Robert Mueller and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. And more revelations about the controversial firm are expected to emerge in Horowitz\u2019s impending report on alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nMueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference detailed how the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr., campaign chairman Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a number of Russians, including Fusion GPS-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, was pitched to the Trump campaign as an opportunity to get damaging information on Hillary Clinton. But Veselnitskaya pulled a bait-and-switch and turned the meeting into a presentation on Russia\u2019s desire to repeal the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law hated by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which sanctioned Russia over the death of Russian corruption whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. Fusion GPS, hired by Veselnitskaya in 2014, provided her with anti-Magnitsky research for years.\n\nAnd Horowitz\u2019s report on FBI Director James Comey\u2019s mishandling of his memos explained how the January 2017 Trump Tower meeting of President-elect Trump and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and Comey involved briefing Trump on their assessment on Russian interference. Yet Horowitz also laid out details showing Comey\u2019s one-on-one meeting with Trump after everyone else left wasn\u2019t just about informing Trump of allegations from British ex-spy Christopher Steele\u2019s Fusion GPS-funded dossier, but was treated by Comey and the FBI as a chance to gather information in their Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nThe Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, was proposed to Trump Jr. by Robert Goldstone at the request of his boss, Emin Agalarov, son of Aras Agalarov, a Russian developer with Russian government ties who\u2019d worked with Donald Trump. Goldstone claimed the \u201cCrown prosecutor of Russia\u201d had information which could \u201cincriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.\u201d Don Jr. responded that \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it\u201d and arranged it. Mueller\u2019s report showed the meeting was about the Magnitsky Act instead.\n\nVeselnitskaya was a Russian prosecutor, then performed government-related lobbying in the U.S. against the Magnitsky Act. Prevezon was a company alleged to have laundered fraudulent money exposed by Magnitsky, so Veselnitskaya hired BakerHostetler to help Prevezon in court \u2014 and the law firm hired Fusion GPS.\n\nGlenn Simpson, the opposition research firm\u2019s founder, testified he started working with Veselnitskaya in 2014 and said \u201cshe would have arranged for Prevezon to pay Baker Hostetler which paid us.\u201d Simpson knew the research he conducted opposing the Magnitsky Act, criticizing Magnitsky advocate and friend Bill Browder and defending Prevezon, made its way to Veselnitskaya. And Simpson met with Veselnitskaya the day before the Trump Tower meeting, the day of it, and the day after. Simpson claimed he didn\u2019t know she was connected to the Kremlin and didn\u2019t know about the Trump Tower meeting beforehand.\n\nVeselnitskaya attended the meeting with a Russian translator and fellow Russian anti-Magnistky Act lobbyists and Prevezon case workers. Veselnitskaya presented a document echoing official Kremlin talking points criticizing the Magnitsky Act and attacking Browder and others by alleging financial misconduct in their support for Democrats. When Don Jr. asked for proof, she had none. The Russians also complained about U.S. sanctions imposed under the Magnitsky Act and Putin\u2019s response banning U.S. adoption of Russian children. Trump associates expecting dirt on Clinton considered the meeting a waste of time. The media revealed the meeting's existence in July 2017.\n\nThe Trump Tower meeting on Jan. 6, 2017, where Comey told Trump about dossier allegations, was meticulously planned by the FBI. Horowitz wrote they were focused on \u201cTrump's potential responses to being told about the \u2018salacious\u2019 information, including that Trump might make statements about, or provide information of value to, the pending Russian interference investigation.\u201d\n\nComey didn\u2019t reveal the dossier\u2019s Fusion GPS origins, its Steele authorship, its funding through Clinton\u2019s campaign, nor its use in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications targeting campaign associate Carter Page.\n\nComey wrote about the meeting immediately after, telling Horowitz it should be treated like counterintelligence information, and Comey had his team on standby to be told what he\u2019d learned. Yet Comey repeatedly testified, \"We were not investigating him personally,\u201d referring to Trump.\n\nBeforehand, Comey met with then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, then- FBI General Counsel James Baker, chief of staff James Rybicki, and leaders of \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation. Some worried Comey\u2019s meeting could be seen as a \u201cHoover-esque type of plot.\u201d\n\nComey had a secure FBI laptop waiting in his FBI vehicle after the Trump Tower meeting and \u201cbegan typing [Memo 1] as the vehicle moved\u201d and worked on it until he got to the FBI's New York field office, where McCabe, Baker, Rybicki, and the team were waiting on a video teleconference. Comey also sent the memo through the FBI's classified email to McCabe, Baker, and Rybicki the next day.\n\nComey classified the memo as secret because the information \u201cought to be treated \u2026 [like] FISA derived information or information in a [counterintelligence] investigation.\u201d McCabe forwarded the memo to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who said Comey sent it \u201cto upload into the case file\u201d because it was \u201ccentral to investigative activity.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting itself, Trump denied the allegations. Comey told Trump media outlets were looking for a news hook to publish the dossier, and days later, on Jan. 10, 2017, CNN ran a story about the Trump-Comey meeting, and that evening, BuzzFeed posted Steele\u2019s dossier online.\n\nSteele\u2019s dossier has also been investigated by Horowitz for more than a year, and his highly anticipated report is expected within weeks.", "description": "The heat is turning up on opposition research firm Fusion GPS, including a lawsuit filed this week by California Republican Rep.
