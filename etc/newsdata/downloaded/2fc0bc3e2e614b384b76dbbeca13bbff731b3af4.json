It took \u00a360million in America alone and has been a roaring success.\n\n'Julian and the team are over the moon with how it played out. No one expected it would be this big.\n\n'The commercial viability of a second film is now a dead cert, so Julian has been told to start putting pen to paper on the follow-up.'\n\nThe Downton Abbey movie came four years after the final episode aired on TV and follows a royal visit to the sprawling manor. It is set in the autumn of 1927.\n\nSuccess: The film, based on the hit TV series of the same name, has taken in more than \u00a3110million at the global box office and has only been out for 26 days\n\nMuch of the show's cast reprised their roles for the film including Hugh Bonneville, Michelle Dockery, Elizabeth McGovern, Allen Leech and Maggie Smith.\n\nKing George V and Queen Mary, portrayed by cast newcomers Simon Jones and Geraldine James, grace the Abbey with their company, along with new character Lady Maud Bagshaw, played by Imelda Staunton, who also joins the franchise.\n\nNews of a sequel comes after Hugh, who plays Robert Crawley, told The Mirror he was open to the idea of a second film.\n\nHe said: 'When we started filming, I thought this is going to be a nice full stop, but there is such an appetite for it, I can see it carrying on. I'd never say never!'\n\nFollow-up: According to The Sun , executives at distributor Focus Features have approached writer Julian Fellowes to begin work on a sequel to make the most out of the film's success\n\nHugh, 55, added that stepping out on the film set wasn't that different to making the beloved British TV show, as it just felt like 'a bigger table.'\n\nAnd of returning to the characters in a feature-length setting, he said: 'Here we all were eight years later. As we looked around the room there were grins of \"can you believe we're here again!\" '\n\nEarlier this year, Michelle, 37, couldn't hide her delight at being able to return to her iconic role as she discussed the film.\n\nSpeaking to InStyle magazine, she said: 'Three years, but it felt like no time had passed at all.\n\nAn insider said: 'Downton\u2019s popularity as a film has been phenomenal. It took \u00a360million in America alone and has been a roaring success'\n\n'[I realised] I\u2019d taken some things for granted. Like driving up to that house [the setting for Downton Abbey], it honestly took my breath away.'\n\nThe Daily Mail's Brian Viner gave the adaptation three out of a five stars. He wrote: 'Could Downton\u2019s creator Julian Fellowes and US director Michael Engler, a TV veteran without much feature-film experience, really make their story properly cinematic?\n\n'The answer is yes, up to a point. The lavish production values and meticulous period detail transfer splendidly to the big screen.\n\n'But in essence, this film is nothing more than an entire series in miniature, full of compacted plots and sub-plots, some compelling, some preposterous, some purring with early promise then fizzling out, just like on the telly.'\n\nThey added: 'The commercial viability of a second film is now a dead cert, so Julian has been told to start putting pen to paper on the follow-up'\n\nMailOnline's Joanna Crawley described the film as being like an 'extended Christmas episode' and described Maggie Smith as 'scene stealing'.\n\nShe wrote: 'The cinematography has been amped up for the cinema audience, with sweeping shots of the grand house coming thick and fast while the the dazzling ariel views of the ballroom dancing really do lend themselves to this new home on the big screen.\n\n'Other TV to movie transitions aren\u2019t quite as successful. Downton tries its best to live up to its big scene billing with some action-led set pieces, but these hurried plot points are hugely overshone by the cosy familiarity of the script...\n\n'The finale belongs to Smith and the excellent Michelle Dockery though, who share the film\u2019s, and perhaps the entire Downton story\u2019s most tender moment.'", "description": "According to The Sun , executives at distributor Focus Features have approached writer Julian Fellowes to begin work on a sequel to make the most out of the film's success.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19479672-0-image-a-2_1570605882061.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
