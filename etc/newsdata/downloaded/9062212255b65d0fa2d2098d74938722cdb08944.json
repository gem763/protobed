He did so by withholding congressionally authorized assistance to Ukraine and planning to withhold it until that country\u2019s leaders announced a politically expedient investigation into Trump\u2019s political rival\u2019s son, a plan that never came to fruition and has backfired spectacularly\u2026\n\nTrump brought this scandal on himself. Nothing compelled him to believe Rudy Giuliani\u2019s theories about Ukraine. His campaign or other surrogates could have dug up and shoveled dirt on Joe Biden and his son. There is plenty to go around.\n\nTrump arguably brought about the political conditions that have made his impeachment possible. He was unable or unwilling to pressure his party to vigorously pursue the most popular items he campaigned on in Congress. Instead they wasted his time with Obamacare repeal. (Another round of health-insurance-policy cancellations or alterations, it turns out, was electoral poison). He encouraged them to pass a politically unpopular tax cut. Mitch McConnell has done the lion\u2019s share of work on appointing judges. But when it comes to the unique \u201cTrumpian\u201d contribution to American governance, the only evidence of a Trump administration\u2019s existence is some executive orders related to the border crisis and a lot of tweets. It\u2019s not a surprise he lost Congress.", "description": "", "authors": ["M.B.
