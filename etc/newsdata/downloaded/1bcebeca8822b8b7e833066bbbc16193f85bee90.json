Despite this and other calls, the Iranian authorities have not lifted all restrictions on women attending football matches.\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, at least 40 women have been arrested and some prosecuted for attempting to enter football stadiums.\n\nAmnesty has called on the Iranian authorities to immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against any woman facing prosecution for attempting to enter a football stadium or protesting against such restrictions.\n\nSince 1981, Iran has banned female spectators from football and other stadiums, Human Rights Watch reports.\n\nThe stadium ban is not written into law or regulation but is ruthlessly enforced by the country\u2019s authorities.\n\nPrior to the Islamic revolution of 1979, women were allowed to attend sporting events.", "description": "But Amnesty International says it's a publicity stunt and calls for all restrictions to be lifted after 'Blue Girl' death", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Twitter", "Afp Getty Images", "Alexander Demianchuk Tass"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Iran-football-fan-dies-after-fire-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
