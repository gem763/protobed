He's getting out soon and will move in with me.\n\nI believe he can turn his life around and he has a good plan and I want to support him. The problem is that my friends and girlfriend don't even know he exists. When I moved here, I was too ashamed to talk about him. How do I break this to them without it seeming like I hid him because he did something truly awful? He didn't \u2014 he was just young and stupid and given too much power too soon.\n\nAlso, how can I keep my brother from finding out that I hid his existence for the past year and a half? I just couldn't find the words so I kept putting it off. Now my brother will be showing up and I have to talk to her \u2014 and probably my friends very soon.\n\n\u2014 Too Ashamed\n\nToo Ashamed: No no. There\u2019s no \u201cprobably.\u201d There\u2019s \u201chave to,\u201d everyone, now.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a bigger reckoning on your to-do list, too.\n\nYour brother just did time for dishonesty, in some form or another. And you were dishonest with your inner circle about this. And you are asking me for advice on the best way to be dishonest with your brother about your dishonesty about his dishonesty.\n\nIt is time to own your [stuff].\n\nI don\u2019t know what went on in your family of origin, but it doesn\u2019t feel rash to suggest honesty and transparency weren\u2019t emphatically taught.\n\nSo now that the grace period is up on these recent lies, please use this opportunity to get to work on yourself. Understand your family\u2019s dynamics and values, break them down to their foundation, stop yourself before you default to them again, and build something real and true in their place.\n\nTalking to your girlfriend is a good place to start: \u201cI need to tell you about my brother. To do that, I need also to tell you about how dishonest I\u2019ve been. I\u2019d also like to explain what I plan to do about it now that I understand the full scope of what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nMean it, live it, and you won\u2019t regret it \u2014 even if the truth costs you some of the people you love. As you\u2019ve learned the hard way, lies catch up with you \u2014 or, if they don\u2019t, they demand unending work to maintain.\n\nRe: Brother: I see a lot of minimization and denial. Your brother committed a crime, not \"some financially questionable stuff\" at work. What he did was bad enough not only to prosecute, but prosecute successfully. He doesn't benefit from you thinking of him as a victim of circumstance or youth. \"I didn't know how to tell people you were in prison\" is a great, truthful way to talk about what happened. \"I didn't know how to tell you my brother was in prison\" works, too. However, your friends may judge you if they think you're making excuses for him.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Right, thanks \u2014 no partial epiphanies about integrity.", "description": "A brother is serving time but he\u2019s not the only one in need of a reckoning.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
