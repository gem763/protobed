Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Tuesday blamed President Donald Trump\u2019s brazen actions in the Ukraine scandal on Congress\u2019 failure to move to impeach him after the release of the Mueller report.\n\nIn the first moments of the Democratic presidential debate, Warren asked voters to \u201clook what happened as a result\u201d of the failure of lawmakers to charge Trump with obstruction of justice based on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller issued the probe\u2019s report in late March.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke the law again this fall,\u201d Warren said, referring to the president\u2019s push for foreign countries to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, another of the Democratic presidential contenders. \u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be able to break the law over and over without consequence.\u201d\n\nImpeachment dominated the opening minutes of the debate, with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper pressing the issue with each of the 12 candidates on stage at Otterbein University, Ohio. In their support for the start of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the candidates were unusually united.\n\nAsked if Congress had any choice but to impeach Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) replied with a forceful, \u201cNo they don\u2019t.\u201d Sanders slammed Trump as \u201cthe most corrupt president in the history of this country,\u201d a line echoed shortly afterward by Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris of California.\n\nSanders called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to \u201cdo the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate\u201d \u2015 something McConnell has not committed to doing if the House refers articles of impeachment as a result of its ongoing inquiry.\n\nHarris was one of several candidates touting her support of not just the impeachment inquiry but of the need to remove the president.\n\n\u201cI know a confession when I see it. He did it in plain sight,\u201d Harris said, referring to Trump openly calling for Ukraine and China to investigate Biden. \u201cHe has given us the evidence. It\u2019s just being observant.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas said, \u201cIf there is not justice, we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country.\u201d\n\nOther candidates were more cautious, supporting impeachment but making clear they were not eager for the issue to take center stage or appear \u201chyperpartisan,\u201d in the words of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro endorsed the impeachment process but quickly twisted away from the question to tout their positions on economic issues or foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThis has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. \u201cWe have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, not rips us apart.\u201d", "description": "\u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be able to break the law over and over without consequence,\u201d she said.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da66bd12100003c0fad1d97.jpeg?cache=qw2zing6t2&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
