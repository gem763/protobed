In the days after Huffman\u2019s arrest, her daughter\u2019s top choice college rescinded her acceptance.\n\nHuffman\u2019s husband, actor William H. Macy, was not charged in the scheme.\n\nHuffman is among 52 people charged with participating in a wide-ranging scheme in which wealthy parents engaged in a bribery and fraud scheme with a California college admissions consultant to get their children into top colleges, including Yale, Stanford and the University of Southern California.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges stemming from the plot to correct wrong answers on college entrance exams and bribe university sports coaches to present his clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits.\n\nSome of the parents have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced. Judge Talwani earlier this month sentenced the founder of a food and beverage packaging company and his wife, Gregory and Marcia Abbott, to one month in prison after they admitted to paying $125,000 in a test-correcting scheme.\n\nOther parents maintain their innocence and will face trial, including \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, clothing designer Mossimo Giannulli.\n\nNo students have been criminally charged.", "description": "\"Desperate Housewives\" star Felicity Huffman reported to a federal prison in California on Tuesday to begin serving a 14-day sentence for her role in a vast U.S. college admissions cheating scandal.", "authors": ["Barbara Goldberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441220112&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1PX-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
