He's been named to six All-Star teams and has a scoring championship under his belt. He's on pace to destroy the all-time record for most career 3-pointers.\n\nBy most accounts, he's changed the way young players shoot the basketball.\n\nThat should be enough to make Curry a Hall of Famer, right?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNot according to Michael Jordan.\n\n\"He's still a great player,\" Jordan said Monday on NBC's \"Today.\" \"Not a Hall of Famer yet, though.

About six years ago, Jordan was asked to pick four players he'd want to team up with in a fictional pick-up game. He chose Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen and James Worthy.\n\nNBC's Craig Melvin asked Jordan if anything had changed since he picked those four and if he'd swap out any of them for current NBA players.\n\nJordan said he would not, and Melvin threw Curry's name out there, asking His Airness if the Warriors star should be offended.\n\n\"I hope not,\" Jordan said, before claiming Curry isn't yet a Hall of Famer.\n\n[RELATED: KD picks Steph over Russ]\n\nCurry has revolutionized the way the game is being played, just like some guy named Jordan did in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nStory continues\n\nJordan did a lot of good during his playing career, but since he hung up that Wizards jersey, not much has gone right for him. These comments are just another black eye on Mike.\n\nProgramming Note: Get ready for the 2019-20 Warriors and Kings seasons with the NBA Tip-Off Show, streaming live on the MyTeams app at 1 p.m. PT on Tuesday, Oct. 22.
