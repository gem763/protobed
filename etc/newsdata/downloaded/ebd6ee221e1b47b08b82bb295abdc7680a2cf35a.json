You have Joe Biden out there with the \u201cWashington Post\u201d op-ed. He hasn\u2019t sat and really answered questions to clear the air on this. Is it going to hurt him?\n\nPage said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s going to hurt him. It\u2019s hurting him already, fairly or not. You start any discussion by saying there is no evidence that Joe Biden did anything illegal or anything improper. That said, on this show, we saw a commercial paid for by the Trump campaign making the case against Biden. We had a USA Today poll this week that showed by 2-1, by 42-21%, Americans say it would be legitimate, there are valid reasons to investigate Biden\u2019s behavior when it came to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThe behavior was not illegal. It\u2019s not unusual for family members the try to cash in on famous or powerful relatives. It is something Americans do not like. It is unseemly that. It is a question that Joe Biden is going to have to answer moving forward.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" USA Today\u00a0Washington bureau chief Susan Page said Americans want Joe Biden's \"unseemly\" behavior over his son Hunter's business in Ukraine investigated. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Susan-Page-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
