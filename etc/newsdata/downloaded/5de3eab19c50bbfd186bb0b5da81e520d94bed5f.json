We are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them, and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities,\" Quinn said in the statement.\n\nQuinn did add that Asian business \"held up well,\" as profits in Asia rose 4% before tax, with \"a resilient performance in Hong Kong,\" despite the unrest.\n\n\"The revenue environment is more challenging than in the first half of 2019, and the outlook for revenue growth is softer than we anticipated at the half-year,\" the bank added in its statement. \"As a result, we no longer expect to reach our return on tangible equity target of more than 11% in 2020.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Financial Times reported that HSBC was cutting up to 10,000 jobs, on top of another 4,700 jobs the bank announced it would cut in August.", "description": "The bank announced it would be remodelling large parts of the company as it abandoned its main financial target.", "authors": ["Yusuf Khan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9aebc3ee40e42b7c12395d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
