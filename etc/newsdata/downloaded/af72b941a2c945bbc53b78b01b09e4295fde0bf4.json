However, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior domestic policy adviser, Lachlan Stuart, responded angrily on Twitter over what he felt it also meant about gay people. \u201cIt is a ludicrous, offensive, homophobic claim,\u201d Stuart said, insisting instead that the same-sex physical contact observed between giraffes in the wild is \u201cnot gay behaviour\u201d at all, but a display of dominance.\n\nAccording to Stephanie Fennessy, director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation in Namibia, Stuart is right. \u201cWhile I totally agree with Dawn Butler\u2019s comment that we should accept people for who they are, she is incorrect in her comment that giraffes are gay,\u201d Fennessy says. \u201cSometimes they fake-hump each other, which is also dominance behaviour. Dogs do that as well. And when you see them necking, it\u2019s fighting. It\u2019s vicious. They can kill each other.\u201d\n\nDr Natalie Cooper, a researcher in life sciences at the Natural History Museum, sees things slightly differently. According to her understanding of giraffe research, same-sex necking, licking, nuzzling and mounting is not always an aggressive act. Indeed, it may not be aggressive at all, and sometimes includes genital stimulation. It is common among males, but has been seen among females too. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t think we have enough research to know why the males do it,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThere are usually females around, so it\u2019s not just because there are no females.\u201d\n\nEven so, it is probably a mistake to call any giraffes \u201cgay\u201d. \u201cGiraffes don\u2019t have a sexual orientation,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThat\u2019s a human thing.\u201d In any case, whatever their same-sex predilections, all giraffes have heterosexual sex as well, or at least they try to. Nor do they form couples of any kind. Adult females live together in herds, and only mate with the transient males who manage to be dominant enough, or surreptitious enough, to visit them at the right time. Afterwards, the male leaves, and takes no role in rearing any offspring. If most giraffes have any \u201ctrue, authentic selves\u201d, in short, they would be bisexual, aromantic. And, as fathers, they set a very bad example.", "description": "Dawn Butler\u2019s claims regarding animal sexuality has been called \u2018offensive\u2019 and \u2018homophobic\u2019 by one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s advisers.
