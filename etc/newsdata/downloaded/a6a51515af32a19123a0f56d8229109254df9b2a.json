Evans called his assessment \"pretty much in line\" with that outlook, which calls for one 25-basis-point cut in 2021 and another in 2022.\n\nThe nation's \"growth outlook is good\" and the central bank has policy prepared should inflation rise above desired levels, Evans said.\n\nEvans' sentiments clash with many Wall Street analysts who have already priced additional rate cuts into their 2019 market projections. Threats from the US-China trade war and slowing global economic growth have prompted many economists to anticipate more rate lowerings in the near future. A lack of additional cuts through 2020 could disappoint investors seeking central bank stimulus.\n\nRead more: BANK OF AMERICA: One of the most trusted defenses against stock-market crashes is on the brink of its demise.

Though some hopes are high that the bank will pull its benchmark rate lower, Evans said the Fed can only do so much to boost markets.\n\n\"We need to acknowledge that there is a limit to what monetary policy alone can accomplish,\" he said, adding that inflation levels are below the central bank's target and additional monetary policy could improperly influence the metric.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nBuilders are the most confident in 20 months that Americans are looking to buy houses\n\nOpioid distributors soar after reportedly offering $18 billion to settle a swath of drug crisis lawsuits\n\nWeWork says it has 527,000 'memberships' but that's not as straightforward as it seems", "description": "Chicago Fed President Charles Evans voted in favor of the September interest rate cut but doesn't see the need for additional stimulus through the end of ...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5da758f8cc4a0a0f4b4a1667-2400/rtr31h1h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
