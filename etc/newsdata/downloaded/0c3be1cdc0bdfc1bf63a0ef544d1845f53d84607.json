Not long after her appearance, Trump announced on Twitter that he would be \u201clooking into\u201d the case \u2014 another instance of the president involving himself in a criminal case outside of U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was reminiscent of Trump\u2019s intervention in Sweden\u2019s arrest of A$AP Rocky. The president made repeated calls for the country to release the American rapper after his June 30 arrest on assault charges, even suggesting that race was a factor in his arrest. Trump\u2019s attempts to influence the Swedish case caused a minor diplomatic spat with the country, a U.S. ally.\n\nUltimately, Rocky was released after his trial ended Aug. 2. He was found guilty but avoided a prison sentence. To the Trump administration\u2019s displeasure, the rapper did not bother to thank the president for his efforts, according to a Yahoo News account of the saga.\n\nA$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2019\n\nIn the Anguilla case, which Trump said seems \u201cvery wrong,\u201d Scott Hapgood faces manslaughter charges for the April 13 death of 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel.\n\nAD\n\nThe young employee\u2019s death \u2014 and the treatment of the man accused of killing him \u2014 sparked outrage on the tiny, 15,000-population island, where the economy is dependent on tourism. Some residents believe Hapgood has been treated favorably, perhaps due to his status as a wealthy tourist, the New York Times reported. He was released from prison hours after his arrest and allowed to board a plane and return to the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of the incident, the Hapgood family was a day into their spring break stay at a five-star resort called Malliouhana. Scott Hapgood, 44, was in the family\u2019s room with two of his children when he heard a knock at the door, Kallie Hapgood said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody in hotel uniform said, \u2018I\u2019m here to fix a leak in the sink,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my husband said, \u2018We don\u2019t have any leaks in our sink, but come on in.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOnce in the room, Mitchel pulled out a knife and demanded money, Kallie Hapgood said. Her husband, a onetime Dartmouth football player, has acknowledged that he overpowered the smaller man and pinned him to the floor until the police showed up. He told the New York Times it was a \u201chard struggle,\u201d during which he was stabbed and bitten.\n\nA bellman who arrived in the hotel room before the police told the newspaper that Mitchel seemed to be struggling for air as Scott Hapgood held him down. The worker, Geshuane Clarke, said Scott Hapgood refused to release Mitchel before authorities arrived, insisting that the trapped man was breathing. Clarke claimed Mitchel tried to speak, but Scott Hapgood told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a thing to say.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMitchel died soon after. A coroner ruled that the cause was asphyxiation from the struggle, and the American banker was charged with manslaughter. Amid the uproar that followed, Anguilla police warned the accused killer that they could not guarantee his safety, according to the New York Times.\n\nAD\n\nMonths later, a revised autopsy report obtained by the New York Times derailed the original account of Mitchel\u2019s death. The new report said it may have happened not as a result of the altercation in the hotel room but rather from a cocaine overdose. The change was based on newly released toxicology tests that showed Mitchel had a lethal level of the drug in his system.\n\nYet the criminal case remains ongoing. Asked why that is, Kallie Hapgood told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d hosts Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt: \u201cIt\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s why I\u2019m here. We need help.\u201d She said her husband, who has returned to the island three times for court proceedings, is \u201can amazing father\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump, I\u2019ve seen him do amazing things for Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Scott Hapgood is the type of American you want to help.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump apparently agreed. In his tweet about the case, he wrote, \u201cWill be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla. Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!\u201d\n\nHe tagged \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Earhardt and a man named Steve Ducey (who tweeted that Fox News viewers \u201cmistakenly tag me a lot, just not... this fox news viewer.\u201d)\n\nWill be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla. Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved! @foxandfriends @SteveDucey @ainsleyearhardt \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nLater Monday, Kallie Hapgood said the family had not yet heard from the president, the Stamford Advocate reported. But, she said, they were \u201cso thrilled\u201d he was interested in the case.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve seen Trump help Americans in peril around the globe, and we really need his help,\" Kallie Hapgood said on \"Fox and Friends.\"", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UOEb2uwTtpdnn1z1bMG60P4N5zY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5MTIL3XOUQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
