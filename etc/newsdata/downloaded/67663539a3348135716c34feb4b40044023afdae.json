That was the trailblazing question posed by art historian Linda Nochlin in 1971. Now, a 21-foot painting of The Last Supper expertly rendered by female Renaissance artist Plautilla Nelli - resurrected from storage where it languished for 450 years before going on view in Florence's Santa Maria Novella Museum this month- nullifies Nochlin's question.\n\nPlautilla who?\n\nConsigned to oblivion for more than four centuries, this painting took four years to restore to its former glory courtesy of crowdsourcing and Advancing Women Artists.\n\nWhat glory? Nelli's way of conveying the states of mind of the apostles. That's the painting's most distinguishing characteristic - \"the expressions of emotion on the apostles' faces,\" according to art historian Linda Falcone in her Book \"When the World Answered\"\n\nThen there are the words of the chief conservator for the restoration, Rosella Lari, Artnet News quotes her saying, \"She had powerful brush strokes and loaded her brushes with paint. Plautilla knew what she wanted and had control enough of her craft to achieve it.\n\nBig picture\n\nNelli had to control a lot of picture plane given its giant size that also included lifesize figures. The scale of the painting has its effect on author Jane Fortune who wrote in her review for Florentine Magazine: \"I am overcome with a sense of wonder. There is no other way to feel when standing before this immense oil-on-canvas masterpiece, created in the 1570s by Florence\u2019s first female painter.\"\n\nSchool days\n\nThe wonder is that Nelli was self-taught.\n\nWomen weren't admitted to art schools, which Nochlin contended was one of the reasons there were no great female artists. Except maybe there were and got disremembered like Nelli. As Artnet News noted, \"More female painters existed during the Renaissance than is immediately apparent.\"\n\nWho knew?\n\nNot that Nelli was a stranger in the Renaissance. Her fellow Florentines knew her as the first female artist of their time.\n\nSo did historian Giorgio Vasari. (More about what he said in a moment). But when museums in Europe carry on and on about the 500-year anniversary of Da Vinci's death, it's easy to see how Nelli might have been overlooked.\n\nOld story\n\nYou might even say the overlooking began 450 years ago when she and all other women were barred from art school. Tara Field, writing for Artnet News explained the barring: \"The social contract of the time did not allow women to hold any occupation outside of the home unless it was in a convent.\" Clearly aware of the ill-effect of keeping women from art training Vasari wrote of Nelli this way in 1568: \u201cShe would have done wonderful things if she had only studied as men do.\u201d\n\nMaking history\n\nAnother first: Natasha Maura pointed out in Women in Art that Nelli's picture of Jesus at his final meal with his apostles was the first time in the history of art that a woman painted it.\n\nAnd it was further significant owing to its mammoth size. Summing up, you have this colossal painting made by a woman who had no training at a time when women were kept from even making art. Even if Nelli's work was not excellent, her accomplishment would be heroic, don't you think?.", "description": "Plautilla Nelli's The Last Supper, held in storage for centuries, goes on view in Florence.", "authors": ["Ramon Sanchez", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Joan Altabe", "The Many Faces Of Damien Hirst Peer Out His New London Exhibit", "London'S National Gallery Exhibit Re-Writes Art History", "Jim Carrey'S Latest Cartoon Mockstrump'S Phone Call To Ukraine"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/21/os/b_1200x630/plautilla-nellis-the-last-supper-image-source-public-domain_2342659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
