You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Chapter 2?\n\nFirst up, you get everything you'd expect in a normal update. That includes a whole new run of cosmetics, new skins and weapons.\n\nSome players have complained that the most intensive of the skins appear to be slowing down the game a little, so using them could cause performance issues. If you are running into problems, swapping back into the default skin could fix them.\n\nThe other, potentially frustrating, change is that your control binds could have been reset, making everything go back to the default, so put those back in if you need to.\n\nBut far more exciting than those standard updates are all the more profound, fundamental changes that the game has made as part of its new chapter.\n\nChief among them is the new map. Though it looks largely similar \u2013 it's still very natural, with lots of trees and lots of water \u2013 the actual things on it have changed, and there are a whole host of new points of interest to explore.\n\nAnother fundamental change is that Epic has introduced new ways of levelling up. Developers promise that will make the game more fun and less of a grand, and say that it features \"a brand new XP system and medals you earn in match\".\n\nAdditional features include new water features, which mean that players can now swim, drive boats and fish in the water. Fishing will usually allow you to get fish that can be eaten for more health \u2013 but sometimes guns will come out of the water, too.\n\nThere are also new squad features. The update brings a new gun called the bandage bazooka that heals teammates when it is shot at them, the ability to carry other players, and group emotes that can be done together.\n\nPlayers can also hide in objects and jump out to kill players, or blow up explosive ones to aid in an attack.\n\nWhat was so strange about the launch?\n\nFor all its new changes and updates, Fortnite Chapter 2 will probably be most memorable for the way it arrived.\n\nPlayers knew that an event called \"The End\" was coming, after it was teased by developers and an in-game timer started counting down to the mysterious time.\n\nBut they were not prepared for just what would happen: the game's entire map was pummelled by huge asteroids, and then players and the entire world was pulled into a void.\n\nThat void became a swirling black hole that took up the entire game, with players entirely unable to play. That state of affairs lasted for nearly two days: from Sunday evening to Tuesday morning, UK time.\n\nDuring that time, players expressed their frustration and their excitement. The game was the biggest on the streaming service Twitch \u2013 despite the fact it wasn't actually possible to play it.\n\nEventually, the black hole disappeared and the servers went entirely offline. A couple of hours later, the game went live again, and all the Chapter 2 features arrived.\n\nHow did the rollout go?\n\nWhile it was a little strange, and players complained about some performance issues, everything seems to have gone fairly smoothly.\n\nYou can follow along with our live blog here, and catch up on how the last strange couple of days in Fortnite have gone:\n\nHere's one reaction to the new update... Here's our round-up of everything new in the latest update. Everything that's new in Fortnite Chapter 2 Fortnite Chapter 2 has finally arrived. The game dropped after players spent nearly two days staring at a swirling black hole that had disappeared the map.

That includes a whole new run of cosmetics, new Here's what the fishing looks like: Sometimes, you'll catch fish, which you can eat to gain back health. But other times, you'll get weapons... On Tfue's stream, players are speculating the new skins (of which there are many) are causing problems for performance. So if you get in and it feels laggy, it might be worth trying the default skin or similar to see if that improves the speed.

Here's our breaking news update on the brand new update: Fortnite is finally back online Fortnite is finally back online, after a nearly two day outage. Players can now play \"Chapter 2\", an entirely new update with a whole new map and a range of new features. It follows a bizarre \"black hole\" event, which saw players unable to get on the game for nearly two days. Instead, anyone logging in was forced to look at a black hole. More follows\u2026 But eventually that resolves into the cinematic trailer, which was leaked earlier and which you can see below. People are seeing the black hole, according to Tfue's live stream. Advertisement Reports coming in that the game is live! The Fortnite page on Epic's website has stopped working. It was previously showing the black hole, but appears to be switching over for something else. Presumably, and hopefully, patch notes!
