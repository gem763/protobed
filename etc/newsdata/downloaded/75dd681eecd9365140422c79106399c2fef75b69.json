Smash It!': Pennsylvania Implores Residents to Kill an Invasive Bug on Sight", "language": "en", "text": "Pennsylvanians cannot stomp their feet fast enough.\n\nThey\u2019re trying. But no matter how many spotted lantern flies they crush underfoot, they cannot seem to keep the hordes of the invasive insect from flapping in their faces, sucking nutrients from valuable vineyards and lurking in their nightmares. Even after death, they pester commuters when their carcasses crunch underfoot on city sidewalks.\n\nThe inch-long creatures, which look a bit like moths and hide scarlet wings beneath gray spotted ones, moved into Philadelphia in recent weeks, swarming around parks and skyscrapers and drawing a clear response from officials: \u201cKill it!\u201d a state website blares by way of advice to residents who encounter the flies. \u201cSquash it, smash it \u2026 just get rid of it.\u201d\n\nIn response to the insect infiltration, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has quarantined 14 counties \u2014 regulating what can be taken in and out \u2014 and has set up a portal and a hotline (1-888-4BADFLY) to report sightings of the species, which is native to parts of Asia.\n\nThe lantern flies have already been spotted in eight states, from Virginia to Massachusetts, leading to quarantines and yearlong abatement efforts. Left alive, the pests could continue flying into more states, injuring trees, reducing fruit yields and hurting farmers\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the daily annoyance.\n\n\u201cIf it would just leap away, people wouldn\u2019t mind it as much, but it seems to always be in your mouth \u2014 or on you and trying to get in your mouth,\u201d said George Holmes, mayor of Hamburg Borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, where the flies were first found in 2014. They are believed to have arrived among a shipment of stones from Asia.\n\nPennsylvanians have come up with many other methods of pulverizing the lantern flies, involving baseball bats, questionable chemical solutions and even stacks of textbooks. Holmes\u2019 dog, Josephine, has a knack for leaping into the air and snagging the bugs with her teeth before spitting them out and stomping on them. Still, no method has been more popular than the classic foot stomp, which seems to have united residents as if it were a service requirement of living in the state.\n\n\u201cI saw a couple stomp on them, as everyone is taking great pride in doing,\u201d said Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, a lawyer in Philadelphia, who was quick to add that he had also done his part. \u201cI saw one and I stepped on it, and I looked around, and there were a bunch of carcasses. And then you realize, they\u2019re fluttering all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe bugs can be quite clumsy, flying haphazardly into pedestrians and windshields, said Heather Leach, an entomologist who studies spotted lantern flies at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMuch about the pests remains unknown, Leach said, adding that their foray into urban areas is worrisome, in part because they will have more opportunities there to hitch rides to other states \u2014 as one did in 2018, when it traveled in a car from Pennsylvania to a mall in Albany, New York. On Monday, a bug believed to be a spotted lantern fly arrived by boat in New York City, according to Customs and Border Protection, whose agricultural specialists were trying to \u201cmitigate the pest threat,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nIn eastern Pennsylvania, the flies have already wreaked havoc in vineyards like those at the Manatawny Creek Winery in Berks County, where lantern flies have been gnawing away at the farm\u2019s 10 acres of grapevines for two years.\n\n\u201cThe volume of grapes has been reduced dramatically,\u201d said Colleen Norheim, the winery\u2019s tasting room manager. \u201cI have a feeling they\u2019ll never go away unless they get a true enemy that annihilates them.\u201d\n\nScientists are looking for just such a nemesis. They have floated a plan to release tiny wasps from China that prey on the lantern flies, but more research is needed before that idea could be feasible.\n\nIn the meantime, Pennsylvanians will have to go on squashing the bugs one at a time or else avoid them altogether.\n\nMichelina Beaumont, a sophomore at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said she was haunted by the thought of feeling the bugs\u2019 bodies crush under her shoe, so she has been tiptoeing to class each day.\n\n\u201cMy response is zigzagging across campus and not interacting with them,\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cThey jump; they\u2019re big; they\u2019re scary. It\u2019s like all of your worst nightmares coming to fruition.\u201d", "description": "Pennsylvanians cannot stomp their feet fast enough.     They're trying.
