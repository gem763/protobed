I would 100% shit myself if I came across that thing just casually slithering along the ground.\n\nThe snake catching team suspect the boa constrictor is about 2.5m (jesus christ) in length and could be sunning itself in the Cascades area after the rain.\n\nThe NSW Government\u2019s Invasive Species department is urging anyone who clocks eyes on the incredibly large danger noodle to contact your nearest snake handler to come and remove it. They\u2019re also warning people to not try and handle the snake, even though boa constrictors aren\u2019t poisonous, they\u2019re likely to strike and wrap themselves around anything that poses a danger (or could be tonight\u2019s dinner).\n\nSnake catcher suspect the boa constrictor could look something like the one shared in the Facebook post but honestly, how many two-and-a-half metre long snakes are slinking around?", "description": "The skin of a boa constrictor (very illegal) has been spotted at a worksite in south-west Sydney, prompting local snake handlers to issue a warning.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/boa-constrictor-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
