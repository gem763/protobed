Ukraine, just the tip of the iceberg,' Giuliani continued.\n\nGiuliani cited new allegations raised at a Wednesday press conference in Kyiv by Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach, who claimed he had investigative documents showing that Burisma paid Biden nearly a million dollars in lobbying fees.\n\nBiden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com late on Wednesday.\n\nRudolph Giuliani, the personal attorney of President Donald Trump, has claimed that Ukrainian gas company Burisma paid Joe Biden $900,000 in lobbying fees\n\nA document made public by Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach on Monday claims to show the Biden's connections with several key players in the Burisma affair\n\nDevon Archer, far left, golfing in the Hamptons with former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, far right, in 2014. Archer served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter\n\nThe Trump campaign has alleged that Biden quashed a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma, where Biden's son Hunter served on the board from 2014 until earlier this year, using the threat of withholding U.S. foreign aid.\n\nBiden has denied any wrongdoing, and Trump's phone call to the Ukrainian president asking him to look into the matter is at the heart of House Democrats' mounting impeachment probe into Trump.\n\nAt the press conference, Derkach made public the documents he received from investigative journalists, including correspondence between officers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and representatives of diplomatic missions of foreign states,\n\nDerkach said the documents offered evidence of fees that Burisma paid Biden through an intermediary. The documents could not be immediately translated or verified by DailyMail.com.\n\n'This was the transfer of Burisma Group's funds for lobbying activities, as investigators believe, personally to Joe Biden through a lobbying company,' Derkach said, according to a translation from Russian news service Interfax.\n\nUkrainian MP Andriy Derkach held a press conference in Kyiv on Wednesday, releasing documents he says show Burisma paid Biden $900,000 in lobbying fees\n\nThis is one of the documents released by Derkach on Wednesday, which purports to show payments leading from Burisma to an entity linked to Joe Biden\n\n'Funds in the amount of $900,000 were transferred to the U.S.-based company Rosemont Seneca Partners, which according to open sources, in particular, the New York Times, is affiliated with Biden. The payment reference was payment for consultative services,' Derkach said.\n\nDerkach insisted that, while serving as vice president, Biden used his influence to squash an investigation into Burisma, where Biden was reportedly making as much as $50,000 a month serving on the corporate board.\n\n'Using political and economic levelers of influencing Ukrainian authorities and manipulating the issue of providing financial aid to Ukraine, Joe Biden actively assisted closing criminal cases into the activity of former Ukrainian Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky, who is the founder and owner of Burisma Group,' he said.\n\nDerkach called for the U.S. Justice Department to independently investigate his allegations and the documents he released.\n\nGiuliani insisted that Derkach's press conference gives weight to his own claims about Biden, which Giuliani has been energetically promoting in cable news interviews.\n\nBiden and his son Hunter are seen together in 2010. Hunter's overseas business ventures while his father was vice president have drawn scrutiny from Biden's critics\n\n'This case stinks. They can run away from it all they want,' Giuliani said, hinting vaguely that Biden could be tied to influence peddling in other countries as well.\n\n'I want you to keep you eye not just on China, I want you to keep your eye on Romania. Just watch Romania,' he said.\n\nAccording to reports in Romanian media, Hunter Biden had business dealings in that country.\n\nHunter Biden was involved in real estate business in Bucharest and allegedly tried to lobby in favor of local real estate tycoon Gabriel Popoviciu before he was sentenced to jail in a high-profile corruption case in 2017, sources close to Popoviciu told local G4Media.ro.\n\nIn his interview, Giuliani said that the media is refusing to consider evidence of potential wrongdoing by Biden's family, that the impeachment inquiry against Trump is unfair.\n\nHe said that the notorious Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s were a fairer process than the Trump impeachment inquiry.\n\nGiuliani called the inquiry a 'process without any due process' and pointed to the media as alleged 'enablers' of the Democrats' plans.\n\n'I never wanted in my life to appear at a Salem Witch Trial, which would actually be fairer than this,' Giuliani added.", "description": "'Biden, his son and his brother had a 30-year-long scam to make money, millions, selling his public office,' Giuliani said in an interview on Wednesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/05/19522528-0-image-a-10_1570682801672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
