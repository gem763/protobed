No public or media access. Cameras and recording devices prohibited without proper authorization.\u201d\n\nBehind those doors is a hallway, which leads to the secret room where Schiff is conducting the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has a huge hearing room in the Longworth House Office Building where they can hold hearings that do not concern classified material, which members of the public and journalists can attend.\n\nBut the impeachment inquiry is taking place in the committee\u2019s Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) \u2014 a room for members to use when discussing and viewing classified material.\n\nRepublicans say the impeachment inquiry is not an intelligence matter that needs to be in the SCIF, but its location gives Schiff the ability to tightly control everything \u2014 and everyone \u2014 going in and out.\n\nSecurity guards stand in front of the two wooden doors to make sure reporters and other unauthorized members of the public stay out. But inside the hallway, there are security officers who make sure unauthorized members of Congress and staffers stay out of the SCIF.\n\nSchiff and the Democrats control who is allowed in.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go in unless you\u2019re on the list,\u201d a congressional source with knowledge of the impeachment inquiry told Breitbart News. \u201c[They] have like a list, so you can\u2019t sneak into the SCIF or try to get an extra staffer in there or something like that.\u201d\n\nUnder Schiff\u2019s rules for the impeachment inquiry, only members of the three committees involved in the inquiry \u2014 House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Government Reform Committees \u2014 are allowed in.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee can have as many staffers as they want in the SCIF, but the other two committees can only have two staffers each.\n\nThe SCIF is a small windowless room that has a long rectangular table in the middle, sources said. Democrats sit on one side, Republicans sit on the other, and the witness sits at the head of the table.\n\nAlthough the room is intended to seat 30 to 40 people, during the recent deposition of Amb. Gordon Sondland there were as many as 70 to 80 people crammed inside, forcing lawmakers to stand and sit on the floor, according to a Republican source on a committee involved in impeachment.\n\nWith so many bodies packed in there, it quickly got too hot, requiring the blasting of air conditioning, which then made it too cold, the source said.\n\nHaving so many people inside the room and dozens of reporters loitering outside is a security hazard and potentially a fire hazard, the Republican source said.\n\n\u201cThe SCIF is supposed to be a secure location for safe-holding of classified information, but there are real concerns about having so many people wandering around,\u201d said the source.\n\nThe depositions typically start with opening statements, then Democrats have about an hour to ask the witness questions, and then Republicans have about an hour.\n\nThere is usually a break before Democrats begin another round of questioning, and then Republicans, and so on, until there are no more questions left. The recent depositions have lasted as many as ten hours.\n\nInside that secret room, Schiff has lorded his power over the process, Republicans say.\n\n\u201cHe will remind you early and often that he is in charge,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who has attended every deposition and transcribed interview.\n\n\u201cSchiff likes to interject himself during the Republican questioning and we always have to point out to him we obviously don\u2019t do the same thing during their questioning, but he just can\u2019t help himself,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the House has not formally voted on beginning an impeachment inquiry \u2014 which would give Republicans certain rights and the Trump administration due process, Republicans are not able to subpoena witnesses and the White House is not able to have a counsel present.\n\nZeldin said Schiff is taking full advantage of that and forcing witnesses to answer questions they are not sure they can answer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll tell the witness to speak even if the witness isn\u2019t sure and there may be an outstanding question about executive privilege or something else,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo inside the super secret bunker of the Capitol, the basement where the impeachment inquiry charade depositions are taking place, he is the grand jury, the judge, and the prosecutor,\u201d he said.\n\nZeldin said Democrats have been petty about sharing materials as well.\n\n\u201cIf a person asks for an additional copy of the exhibit, the sick smile that will be on some people\u2019s faces as if somehow being in the majority means that we should make a petty moment of what might be a genuine ask,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans say Democrats are keeping transcripts from members of Congress who will ultimately vote on any articles of impeachment, and even from Republican members involved in the inquiry.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes said Republican members involved in the inquiry cannot even view transcripts without having \u201cminders\u201d looking over their shoulder. \u201cThat is unprecedented,\u201d Nunes told Fox News on Wednesday.\n\nStaffers of the committees say the environment inside and outside the SCIF is tense.\n\n\u201cIt is so, so tense. I mean, it is like what you see in movies tense. It\u2019s weird,\u201d said the congressional source.\n\n\u201cIt is just crazy. No one talking to anybody. Everyone being real quiet, because you just don\u2019t know who\u2019s standing around you,\u201d the source said. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with three committees and you don\u2019t know who everyone is.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say the depositions and interviews are unclassified and there is no need for them to take place behind closed doors.\n\nSchiff has defended the secrecy of the hearings by comparing it to a \u201cgrand jury,\u201d claiming he does not want potential witnesses to be able to compare stories.\n\nBut Republicans argue that his claim is undercut by the numerous leaks from Democrats to reporters about what is being said during the closed-door interviews, despite House ethics rules gagging both sides.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this process of cherry-picking leaks withholding key facts and outright lying is a formula of Adam Schiff that many in the media are playing along with, and many people who were part of the enraged liberal activist base eat up,\u201d Zeldin said.\n\n\u201cThis whole project, is Schiff\u2019s desire to write the world\u2019s worst parody to take down a sitting president,\u201d he said, referring to Schiff reading a fake conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a hearing and later justifying it as a \u201cparody.\u201d\n\nRepublicans suspect that Democrats instructed the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to file his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general instead of the State or Justice Department inspector general so that the matter could be handled by Schiff behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about shaping the narrative,\u201d the Republican source said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole leaking apparatus in place.\u201d\n\nThe source characterized that apparatus as the same as during the FBI\u2019s collusion investigation \u2014 selective leaks to reporters that are then blown out of context with no countervailing narrative.\n\nMore than two dozen House Republicans led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) stormed the SCIF on Wednesday morning, demanding access to an impeachment inquiry that could reverse the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cSo far, Adam Schiff\u2019s impeachment inquiry has been marked by secret interviews, selective leaks, weird theatrical performances of transcripts that never happened, and lies about contacts with the whistleblower,\u201d Gaetz said at a press conference before the storming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to go in there and we\u2019re going to try to figure out what\u2019s going on, on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent that want to see this Congress working for them, and not obsessed with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) added, \u201cAdam Schiff is trying to impeach a president of the United States behind closed doors, literally trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election a year before Americans get to go to the polls and decide who\u2019s going to be the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve better, we will demand better,\u201d Scalise said.\n\n\u201cThis is being held behind closed doors for a reason \u2014 because they don\u2019t want you to see what the witnesses are like,\u201d said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), citing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s faltering testimony.\n\n\u201cThis is a Soviet-style impeachment process, this is closed doors, it is unfair in every way,\u201d Biggs added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go in there and demand we get our rights as members of Congress.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have suggested that they would open the hearings up to the public, but have not stated exactly when.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s obviously a step after this. But right now we\u2019re concentrating on getting as many people as we can,\u201d said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) said, according to the Hill.\n\nThe pace is already beginning to take a toll on staffers and even reporters, sources said.\n\n\u201cThis is like a marathon. And we\u2019re like on mile nine and we\u2019re severely out of shape. Even the reporters who are there, they\u2019re like tired, everyone\u2019s like kind of gassed,\u201d the congressional source said.\n\n\u201cThis is like the long slog with not a lot of certainty on when it\u2019s going to end. We\u2019ve been flying through people. They supposedly want to get it done between Christmas and Thanksgiving. There are staffers who have worked for 20 days. They have not taken a single day off and work from 8am to 8pm,\u201d the source said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Talk of the impeachment inquiry is everywhere in America, but Americans have no idea what it actually looks like.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Impeachment-Inquiry-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
