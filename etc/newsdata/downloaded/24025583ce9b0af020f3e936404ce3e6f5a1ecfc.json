He drove the entire length of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border and spoke with immigrants fleeing poverty, corruption, and gang violence. He was charmed by dynamic cities like Monterrey and Mexico City. He visited areas populated primarily by indigenous communities and had at least one scary run-in with a corrupt cop. And he got to meet Subcomandante Marcos, spokesperson for the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.\n\nBut the event that really stood out for Theroux, and for him seemed to typify his south-of-the-border experience, occurred in San Dionisio Ocotepec, a small town in the state of Oaxaca. It was there that Theroux happened to be invited to a family meal during a period of mourning for an old woman who had just died.\n\n\u201cI was invited to this meal, and I was sitting under a tree with 30 or 40 other people,\u201d says Theroux, \u201cand I realized I was in the bosom of a family grieving for their grandmother, and they were very conversational. It was an amazing experience of generosity, hospitality, people confiding in me, and being part of the family. I found Mexicans to be among the most hospitable people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

Mexico is a world.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have 500 years of colonial culture, and thousands of years of civilization,\u201d adds Theroux, in his interview with The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s the landscape, the food, the language. Americans don\u2019t know enough about Mexico; we are ignorant of the way Mexicans live their lives, and the richness of their history.\u201d\n\nTheroux\u2019s book bounces around from town to city, trying to find the Mexican essence. He does not shirk from writing about some of the biggest issues that face the country: the violence of the drug cartels, cross-border immigration, and the corruption that permeates everyday life. The latter, he says, stems from a variety of factors, including a state weakened by numerous small wars the country fought in the 19th century, the disastrous revolution of 1910, and a country which doesn\u2019t pay its taxes and is sustained by informal trade, which involves petty corruption and police looking the other way in exchange for a mordida (bribe).\n\nWhat this means, Theroux says in his book, is that \u201cthe experience of living under a corrupt government and trying to stay honest yourself made people cynical and distrustful of authority, but at the same time self-sufficient and dependent on friends and family.\u201d\n\nTheroux also recognizes that the so-called border crisis, far from being static and unchanging, has evolved over the years. Where once a large percentage of the migrants were Mexicans escaping poverty and drug-related violence, now most are Central Americans fleeing corrupt governments and rapacious gangs\u2014with a heavy sprinkling of Africans, Indians, and Pakistanis.\n\n\u201cMexicans are as worried about immigration as we are,\u201d says Theroux. \u201cThey have a problem with migrants, and it\u2019s the same problem we have. We need to have really good relations with the Mexican government. We need to respect them, we need Mexico as a partner, and we don\u2019t have that. We share a border, but we are making an enemy. Our diplomacy has to be a lot better.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue of drugs, guns, and the cartels, in which the country north of the border plays a significant role. In this case, a quote from former Mexican President Porfirio Diaz, which Theroux does not employ in the book, seems relevant: \u201cPoor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States.\u201d The fact is, Mexico has strict gun control laws, which means many of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the States. And, says Theroux, although a serious law enforcement partnership on the part of the Mexican and American governments could make a difference, \u201cit would help if Americans decided to rid themselves of their cocaine and fentanyl dependency.\u201d\n\nEasier said than done, of course. And it doesn\u2019t seem to help that the Mexican government appears incapable of concerted action that would rid the country not just of cartel violence but the corrupt police and military who are complicit in it\u2014in many towns, the police force is staffed by narcos.\n\n\u201c Theroux calls Mexico City \u201cone of the greatest cities in the world, a great cultural center,\u201d \u201d\n\nAs an example, On the Plain of Snakes spends some time recounting the story of the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa, who in 2014 commandeered a bus for a demonstration, were taken into custody by police, handed over to a local crime syndicate and murdered. The case has become a national scandal and, Theroux writes, shows that \u201cpeople in power\u2014police, politicians\u2014believe they can get away with murder. Ayotzinapa reveals the penetration of the cartels in all Mexican institutions.\u201d\n\nWhat seems to make the situation even more tragic is that the current Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as AMLO, is a leftist elected on a reform platform. But so far, he has had little or no effect on the country\u2019s problems. And that, claims Theroux, says a lot about Mexican power politics.\n\n\u201cI think that the problem is that in the DNA of Mexican power no one gets very far from the reins of power,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s one bunch of people, and he\u2019s drawing [cabinet ministers] from that group. Mexican politics is sort of a family, and there are no new people.\u201d\n\nBut On the Plain of Snakes is not simply a depressing recitation of Mexico\u2019s problems. Theroux also finds to praise. He\u2019s dazzled by the city of Monterrey, which he says is \u201cso big, so prosperous, there was so much happening there, in terms of culture and manufacturing.\u201d He loves Mexican cuisine and writes about the many excellent meals he had. There is a deep love for the indigenous Mexican culture and history that exists primarily in towns and cities in the southern part of the country, and in its magnificent ruins. And Theroux calls Mexico City \u201cone of the greatest cities in the world, a great cultural center,\u201d adding that \u201csome of the best writers I have ever met, I met in Mexico.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also utterly star struck by Subcomandante Marcos, a former college professor who spent years in the jungle earning the trust of the indigenous people of Chiapas and then helped lead them in a movement that essentially set up a separate state within Mexico. \u201cI thought he was an example of someone who is completely idealistic, and humane,\u201d says Theroux. \u201cHe\u2019s a completely admirable person.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Theroux wrote On the Plain of Snakes because he wants the kind of people who vacation on the Mayan Riviera to realize that Mexico is not just \u201ctacos, sombreros, and mariachis, it\u2019s a big, complicated, interesting place. A big, vibrant country full of subtlety, cultural differences and a place that\u2019s humane\u2014it\u2019s not a cartel dominated place. The humanity of Mexico is what I\u2019d like to see [readers] take away from the book.\u201d", "description": "Researching his latest book, the acclaimed travel writer and novelist drove the entire US-Mexico border and then did a deep dive into Mexico itself.
