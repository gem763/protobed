Deforestation has accelerated, despite the pledges that have been made.\u201d\n\nDeforestation: damage goes far beyond Amazon Read more\n\nThe New York declaration on forests was signed at the UN in 2014, requiring countries to halve deforestation by 2020 and restore 150m hectares of deforested or degraded forest land.\n\nBut the rate of tree cover loss has gone up by 43% since the declaration was adopted, while the most valuable and irreplaceable tropical primary forests have been cut down at a rate of 4.3m hectares a year.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the declaration, to halt deforestation by 2030 \u2013 potentially saving as much carbon as taking all the world\u2019s cars off the roads \u2013 now looks further away than when the commitment was made.\n\nIn Latin America, south-east Asia, and Africa \u2013 the major tropical forest regions \u2013 the annual rate of tree cover loss increased markedly between 2014 and 2018, compared with 2001 to 2013. While the greatest losses by volume were in tropical Latin America, the greatest rate of increase was in Africa, where deforestation rates doubled from less than 2m hectares a year to more than 4m.\n\nThe report uses data up to 2018 in most cases, so the figures do not include the impact of the most recent burning in the Amazon. The report\u2019s authors note that in June, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon rose by 88% compared with the same month last year.\n\nStreck warned the recent fires were a particular concern because, whereas in previous decades when the humid nature of the rainforest made it hard to burn, with the lush vegetation acting as an effective firebreak, global heating in recent years has dried out parts of the forest and made it easier to combust.\n\n\u201cThe fires are coming at the beginning of the dry season, which is when you would have expected the forests to be at their wettest and hardest to burn,\u201d she said. \u201cThis shows we could be entering into a feedback loop.\u201d\n\nFeedback loops are feared by climate scientists because they amplify the effects of heating. In the case of forests, climate change dries out trees, making them more flammable, and increasing temperatures so they burn more easily, which then contributes more carbon dioxide, which fuels heating.\n\nKeeping existing forests standing, particularly in tropical regions, and restoring wooded areas that have been damaged, has long been recognised as one of the cheapest ways of tackling the climate crisis. The cost of preserving key forests globally has been estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars a year, compared with the trillions needed to shift to low-carbon infrastructure.\n\nJo House, a reader in environmental science and policy at the University of Bristol, said: \u201cDeforestation, mostly for agriculture, contributes around a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. At the same time, forests naturally take up around a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\n\n\u201cThis natural sink provided by forests is at risk from the duel compounding threats of further deforestation and future climate change. The continued loss of primary forests, at ever-increasing rates, despite their incalculable value and irreplaceability, is both shocking and tragic.\u201d\n\nOne of the difficulties highlighted by the report is that of gaining private sector support and investment for keeping forests standing. While there are clear economic benefits to cutting down forests, in the form of timber production and expanded agriculture, there are few investments being made in keeping existing forests healthy.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that many governments offer subsidies to agriculture, which provide perverse incentives for deforestation.\n\nThe report from a coalition of 25 organisations is being presented in New York before a series of events focusing on the climate crisis in the run-up to the UN secretary general\u2019s summit later this month. At the meeting, world leaders are expected to come up with new proposals for tackling the climate emergency.\n\nBut Streck said the failure to meet the pledges made five years ago undercut the value of such promises if they were not backed up with finance, detailed plans and on-the-ground implementation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more important guys standing up making pledges,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to go beyond declarations. Implementation is complicated, but it\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nThere have been some bright spots. The rate of loss of primary forest in Indonesia slowed by nearly one-third between 2017 and 2018. Palm oil plantations in the country are a major cause of deforestation, but companies and the government have come under pressure from consumers and aid donors. Wetter weather that reduced forest fires also helped.\n\nWhile some countries have embarked on tree-planting schemes, notably in Ethiopia, but also in Mexico and El Salvador, these have been far outweighed by the loss of existing forests. Tree planting does not compensate for the loss of standing forests, because established growth yields benefits beyond carbon uptake, through the whole ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt can take centuries for forests to recover their full carbon-absorbing and weather-regulating capabilities,\u201d Streck said.", "description": "Chance of ending deforestation by 2030 seems lower than when pledge was made five years ago", "authors": ["Fiona Harvey", "Van Badham", "Rowan Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0200f30d978aafab22f3ead2bf631fac820670e2/0_179_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fb728782e00ae029d8526fd2da8a3b8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
