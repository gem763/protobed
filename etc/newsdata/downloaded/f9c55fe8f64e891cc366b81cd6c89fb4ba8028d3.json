I'm so f***ing glad we got Osuna!'\n\nTaubman repeated himself about a half dozen times, according to the report. Apstein wrote that 'the outburst was frightening and offensive enough that another Houston staffer apologized.'\n\nAfter first declining to comment on SI's story, the Astros responded after it was published Monday night, describing the reporting as 'misleading and completely irresponsible.'\n\nBut several other reporters who were in the clubhouse at the time said the report is accurate.\n\nAccording to a story by Sports Illustrated's Stephanie Apstein (left), Houston Astros assistant general manager Brandon Taubman (right) turned to three females in the clubhouse after clinching the pennant, shouting: 'Thank God we got Osuna!

The woman returned to her native Mexico shortly after and charges were never filed by Toronto prosecutors against Osuna, who was a member of the Blue Jays at the time. After serving his 75-game suspension, Osuna was traded to Houston in July and subsequently led the American League with 38 saves and an impressive 2.62 earned-run average. Apstein detailed the domestic abuse allegations after covering Game 6 of the AL Championship Series and heading to the raucous Houston locker room afterward\n\nAfter first declining to comment on SI's story, the Astros responded after it was published Monday night, describing the reporting as 'misleading and completely irresponsible'\n\nSeveral other reporters who were in the clubhouse at the time said the report is accurate\n\n'The Astros called this (Sports Illustrated) report misleading,' tweeted Hunter Atkins, a reporter with the Houston Chronicle. 'It is not. I was there. Saw it. And I should've said something sooner.'\n\n'Can confirm,' tweeted Hannah Keyser of Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Astros did not make Taubman available for an interview for the Sports Illustrated story. The team was given a chance to comment before the story was published, but responded only afterward, claiming the story was the magazine's 'attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.'\n\nOsuna allegedly assaulted the mother of his son in May of 2018.

Minutes earlier, Osuna had given up a two-run homer in the ninth inning to blow a lead before the Astros beat the New York Yankees 6-4 on a two-run homer by Jose Altuve.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle cited eyewitnesses who described Taubman as holding a cigar and standing with two or three other men when he screamed toward the group of women. No interviews were taking place at the time and no players were in the vicinity, the Chronicle reported, with about eight feet separating the Astros official from the startled reporters\n\n'An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing,' the team said in a statement. 'Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time. His comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else - they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated's attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.'\n\nThe Houston Chronicle cited eyewitnesses who described Taubman as holding a cigar and standing with two or three other men when he screamed toward the group of women.
