They\u2019re always putting pressure on.\n\n\"I\u2019d sometimes get a 10-minute break because I was tired, but they have their eye on you.\n\n\"One of the managers reported me, when I was pregnant, for not being at my station. I was filling out my maternity form.\u201d\n\nShe said another pregnant woman who fell ill was refused an ambulance.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey called her a taxi after taking her to the first aider.\u201d\n\n(Image: ExpressStar)\n\nAnother woman, in her 50s, claims management would not call an ambulance when she was \u201cscreaming in pain\u201d on the floor after a heavy package fell on her.\n\nAnother former worker, named only as Josephine, 55, claims she was dismissed after sustaining a work injury following claims she was not at her work station for two hours one day.\n\nShe claims bosses clocked every minute she was absent, including toilet breaks, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s modern slavery in there.\u201d\n\nMr Gabay said: \u201cWhy are people treated like this? [Amazon boss] Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and this his how his company is run.\u201d\n\nSome workers tried to form a union, which they are seeking to officially register.\n\nMr Gabay did not pass his probation period and claims this was a result of his union role.\n\nOne worker given a warning about her \u201cproductivity\u201d believes she was targeted because she joined the union.\n\nAmazon said: \u201cWe do not recognise these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our building.\n\n\"Tilbury fulfilment centre is a safe and positive workplace.\n\n\"Safety is our No1 priority and we take the wellbeing of our associates extremely seriously.\n\n\"We will always call an ambulance if one is required.\n\n\"Our team of on-site first-aiders follow NHS guidance when an ambulance should be called.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Exhausted staff at the Amazon warehouse in Tilbury, Essex fall asleep on the loo, were punished for trying to form a union and get reported for taking breaks longer than ten minutes", "authors": ["Matthew Young", "Image", "Expressstar", "Philip Coburn"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660209.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michael-Gabay-Amazon-Whistle-Blower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
