The president pointed out how the Democratic leader was struggling to tamp down a rebellion in her ranks; then, Pelosi offered a quick comeback.\n\n\u201cMr. President,\u201d Pelosi said, \u201cplease don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cElections have consequences, Mr. President,\u201d added Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump touts Turkey cease-fire: 'Sometimes you have to let them fight' Mattis responds to Trump criticism: 'I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals' Democrats vow to push for repeal of other Trump rules after loss on power plant rollback MORE (D-N.Y.), just to emphasize how power had shifted in the new divided government.\n\nThe meeting ended and Pelosi walked out of the White House with what she wanted: A TV clip of Trump conceding that, yes, he wanted to shut down the government over border security.\n\nWhat she didn\u2019t count on was that a photo of her victory lap \u2014 Pelosi putting on sunglasses while donning a red, knee-length Max Mara coat \u2014 would set the internet ablaze and become an iconic image of the 79-year-old grandmother of nine.\n\nWeeks later, Trump walked out of a meeting with \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d over how to reopen the government. The president asked if Democrats would fund his border wall, Pelosi said no, so he left.\n\n\u201cI said bye-bye,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nIn February, another image of the president and Speaker set tongues wagging: A photograph of Pelosi, standing on the dais behind the president at his State of the Union address, sporting suffragist white and clapping with her hands extended toward the president.\n\nSome observers dubbed the photo: \u201cthe clapback.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s gathering, called by the White House, was intended to brief lawmakers from both parties on the administration\u2019s strategy in Syria following Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops in the region.\n\nThe meeting started on a sour note, with Trump suggesting he\u2019d rather be elsewhere. \u201cSomeone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it,\u201d he said, according to a senior Democratic aide.\n\nIt went downhill from there.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPelosi, emphasizing the lopsided 354-60 vote hours earlier on a resolution rebuking Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal, accused the president of having no plan in Syria while devising foreign policy designs that put Russian interests above those of the U.S. \u201cAll roads with you lead to Putin,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump countered that Pelosi has sympathies for ISIS, then challenged her political prowess. \u201cIn my opinion, you are a third-grade politician,\u201d he said.\n\nThe back-and-forth continued after Pelosi, joined by other Democratic leaders, departed the cabinet room in protest. On the White House lawn, the Speaker said Trump had experienced \u201ca meltdown.\u201d\n\nThe president responded in kind, tweeting the now-famous picture from inside the meeting with a biting caption: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s Unhinged Meltdown!\u201d Pelosi's office quickly embraced the image, making it the cover photo of her Twitter account.\n\nPelosi\u2019s Democratic backers have quickly rushed to her defense, arguing that Trump, a wealthy real estate mogul, isn\u2019t accustomed to pushback \u2014 particularly from a woman \u2014 and hasn\u2019t come to grips with the fact that Congress is a co-equal branch of government holding powers he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously not used to dealing with strong women and she knows that, so whenever she shows a bit of strength or pushback, that really unnerves him,\u201d House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth John Allen YarmuthOn The Money: Trump signs stopgap spending bill | Shutdown fight delayed to November | Deutsche Bank reveals it has two individual tax returns tied to House subpoena | House Dems demand documents on Ukraine aid It's time to axe the unjust 'widow's tax' House Democrats demand White House turn over docs on Ukraine aid MORE (D-Ky.), a close Pelosi ally who attends her weekly leadership meetings, told The Hill.\n\nRep. Dan Kildee Daniel (Dan) Timothy KildeeHow Trump and Pelosi went from bad to worse Inspector general to review DOD's use of PFAS Working Families Tax Relief Act would help millions join middle class MORE (D-Mich.) offered a similar assessment, saying the famously impulsive president simply doesn\u2019t know how to respond as the impeachment investigation races forward and \u201cthe walls started to cave in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is unstable. He resents the fact that she is so much smarter and so much tougher than he is, that he just can\u2019t take it. He can\u2019t take it,\u201d Kildee said. \u201cHe\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s deranged. It\u2019s the wheels coming off.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at what he\u2019s going through right now. He has no one agreeing with him on his failed policy in Syria. He\u2019s going through an impeachment process. I guess I\u2019d be waking up on the wrong side of the bed also in the morning,\u201d added Progressive Caucus Co-Chairman Mark Pocan Mark William PocanTop progressive calls for Pompeo's salary to be withheld over Sondland's blocked testimony Democrats take Trump impeachment case to voters Democrats press Nadler to hold Lewandowski in contempt MORE (D-Wis.).\n\nTrump\u2019s GOP allies have been just as fierce in their defense of the president, blaming Pelosi for the recent White House flare-up with suggestions she staged the scene just to put Trump in a negative light.\n\n\u201cYou know what happened when Speaker Pelosi had left the room? It seemed pretty much calmer. It seemed much more productive,\u201d said GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyHouse Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment GOP leader defends Mulvaney amid backlash over quid pro quo comments Republicans seek to delay effort to censure Schiff after Cummings' death MORE (Calif.), who attended the White House meeting. \u201cIt seemed as though when the Speaker was in the room, she was there for one reason and one reason only, and that's really unbecoming of a Speaker.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said Pelosi just knows precisely what to do or say to get under Trump\u2019s skin. She did it again on May 22. Shortly before leaving the Capitol for a White House infrastructure meeting, Pelosi stopped for the cameras and declared that the president was \u201cengaged in a cover-up\u201d of Russian election interference.\n\nTrump apparently was watching. He stormed into the meeting, railed at Pelosi for her \u201ccover-up\u201d comments, said he couldn\u2019t work with Democrats until they ended their \u201cphony investigations,\u201d then walked out.\n\n\u201cIf I were advising Nancy, I would say, \u2018Keep going,\u2019 because every time she does it she comes out of it looking stronger and stronger,\u201d Yarmuth said.", "description": "The explosive meeting this week between President Trump and Democratic leaders reveals just how far relations between the president and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have deteriorated amid Democrats\u2019 escalating impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pelosinancy_trumpdonald_101819gn_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
