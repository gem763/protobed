This broadly mirrored very different perceptions of how individual countries had progressed since the momentous events of 1989-91, when a wave of optimism swept Europe as walls and regimes fell, ushering in more open societies and markets, the survey\u2019s authors said.\n\nMost Poles, Czechs and Lithuanians, and more than 40% of Hungarians and Slovaks, for example, said they felt most people in their countries were better off than 30 years ago; in Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria, more than half felt things were worse.\n\nAsked how they felt their countries had advanced, central and eastern Europeans were most positive about education (65%), living standards (61%) and national pride (58%). They were less happy about about law and order (44%) and family values (41%), and a majority (53%) said healthcare had got worse in the post-communist era.\n\nBut across all the former communist nations surveyed, people were \u201cmostly pessimistic about the functioning of the political system, and about specific economic issues like jobs and inequality\u201d, the survey\u2019s authors said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators hold up a Czech and an EU flag during an anti-government protest in Prague in May.

Today, the figure is 56%.", "description": "Pew research reveals very different views on whether countries are better off today", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf75f2c801e64a3eef8643929dcdcbbdc5ecb81c/0_348_7087_4252/master/7087.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b99252ba0e8a65be5047d8b129f6983", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
