Logically, I know it to be nonsense, but it can provide comfort in some of the most challenging times. It can even give a glimmer of optimism that wonderful things can come from the aftermath of a disaster \u2013 even one as pointless and self-inflicted as Brexit.\n\nWhat reason could there possibly be for this humiliating omnishambles? Every day the situation goes from bad to worse. In 2016, we were promised \u201cthe easiest trade deal in human history\u201d. We were told we could remain in the customs union and the single market, that we could have a relationship with the EU like Norway or Switzerland.\n\nAnd yet, we are now staring down the barrel of a no deal exit from the EU \u2013 levelled at us by our own government and their futile attempts to pander to both the DUP and ERG. If this is allowed to happen, our economy will crash. There will be food shortages. An insufficient supply of medicines and medical isotopes will likely lead to avoidable deaths.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAll of this, and so much more, for no discernible benefits.\n\nBut while Brexit itself is, and will always be, an existential threat to our politics, our economy, and our society, it has brought at least one reason to be hopeful. Rising to meet that threat is my generation: young people whose futures have been so often overlooked.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nI have been quite open about the fact that when I was younger, I was apathetic with respect to politics. I saw a system that didn\u2019t represent my views and so, despite voting, engaging seemed futile.\n\nIn hindsight it was a poor position to have held. It is now obvious to me that politicians will always seek to engage with those who are most likely to vote. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t until the days following the 2016 referendum that I realised I needed to do more, and recent events have only compounded those feelings.\n\nI have not been alone in coming to this decision. Young people from all corners of the country have realised that if we stand up and make ourselves heard then we can make change happen. And we\u2019re standing up. We have led marches through London. We have lobbied our MPs at Westminster. We are in newspapers, on television, and all over social media. We are increasingly an equal part of the debate. All of this, and the catalyst was Brexit.\n\nAs young people, we care about so much more than Brexit: climate change; rising levels of poverty and inequality; the creeping privatisation and inadequate funding of the NHS \u2013 these are just some of the issues that resonate strongly with our generation. But we have to win this fight first.\n\nWe are reaching the endgame \u2013 or perhaps the end of the beginning. It feels like we have one last chance to play our part in preventing the chaos. This Saturday 19 October, we will be marching once again in what promises to be one of the largest protests to descend upon Westminster. Just 12 days before we\u2019re due to leave the EU with or without a deal, this will be the most important opportunity to demonstrate how you feel. I\u2019m going to be there, surrounded by thousands of my peers: because this is an issue that is too important to sit out.", "description": "\u201cEverything happens for a reason.\u201d It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 we\u2019ve all heard, but one that I\u2019ve always hoped to be true.
