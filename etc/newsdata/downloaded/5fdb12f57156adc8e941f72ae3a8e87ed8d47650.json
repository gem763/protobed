Dunkin, Tim Hortons, Subway and Del Taco all offer plant-based meat on menus.\n\nEven Lewis Hamilton, a Formula One champion, has invested in a fast-food chain that will offer all plant-based foods including Beyond Burgers - the first location opened in London in September, Bloomberg reported.\n\nBeyond Meat has set its sights even higher than the $140 billion projection.
