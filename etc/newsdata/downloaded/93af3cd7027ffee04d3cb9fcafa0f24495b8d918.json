But Obama\u2019s longer record on the economy is also coming under fire from the left. The Obama people \u2014 many of whom came to the White House from Wall Street and left it for Silicon Valley \u2014 seemed entirely too comfortable with the ongoing corporatization of America.\n\nIn the Obama years, the government let corporations get bigger and economic power grow more concentrated. Obama\u2019s regulators declined to push antimonopoly measures against Google and Facebook, against airlines and against big food and agriculture companies.\n\nIt is true that Obama succeeded in passing a groundbreaking universal health care law . It\u2019s also true that over the course of his presidency, inequality grew, and Obama did little to stop it. While much of the rest of the country struggled to get by, the wealthy got wealthier and multimillionaires and billionaires achieved greater political and cultural power.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of returning to this history now, a decade later? Think of it as a cautionary tale \u2014 a story that ought to rank at the top of mind for a Democratic electorate that is now choosing between Obama\u2019s vice president and progressives like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who had pushed Obama, during the recovery, to adopt policies with more egalitarian economic effects.\n\nFrom this distance, the history favors Warren\u2019s approach. As Hundt notes, not only did Obama\u2019s policy ideas produce lackluster economic results (at least in that they failed to hit their stated goals), they failed politically, too. The sluggish recovery in Obama\u2019s first years led to a huge loss for Democrats in the 2010 midterms. Obama was re-elected, but during his time in office, Democrats saw declining national support \u2014 and in 2016, of course, they lost the White House to Donald Trump, an outcome that Warren has tied directly to Obama\u2019s early economic decisions.\n\nWhy had Obama chosen this elitist path? Another new book, \u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,\u201d by the antimonopoly scholar Matt Stoller, provides a deeply researched answer. It boils down to this: Obama, like Bill Clinton before him, was the product of a Democratic Party that had forgotten its history and legacy. For much of the 20th century, Democrats\u2019 fundamental politics involved fighting against concentrations of economic power in favor of the rights and liberties of ordinary people. \u201cThe fight has always been about whether monopolists run our world, or about whether we the people do,\u201d Stoller writes.", "description": "It rhymes with \u2018schneo-liberalism.\u2019 It was an economic disaster and a political dead end.", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/opinion/18manjooWeb/18manjooWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
