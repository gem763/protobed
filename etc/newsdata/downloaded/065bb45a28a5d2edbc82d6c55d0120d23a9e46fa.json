That should worry Democrats.", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to 2020 Vision, the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one smart, fast takeaway every weekday and a deeper roundup every weekend. Reminder: There are 138 days until the Iowa caucuses and 412 days until the 2020 election.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 When President Trump touched down in California Tuesday, local Democrats seemed to greet his arrival largely as a platform for protest, with at least a hundred demonstrators lining the road near his first event as enormous Baby Trump and Trump Chicken balloons hovered overhead.\n\nBut the real reason Democrats should be paying attention to Trump\u2019s current California swing isn\u2019t because it\u2019s a prime opportunity to register their displeasure with policies on immigration, emissions and forest management.\n\nInstead, Democrats\u2019 cause for concern should be the mountains of money Trump is raising here \u2014 and, more importantly, the right-wing energy that money represents.\n\nCalifornia has long been an ATM for politicians of both parties. But even so, Trump\u2019s haul this week is expected to be eye-popping. At Tuesday\u2019s secretive Portola Valley luncheon, where ticket prices ranged from $1,000 to $100,000 and attendees were whisked to an undisclosed luncheon by shuttle, Trump raked in $3 million. Later that night, at a Beverly Hills soiree hosted by billionaire developer and longtime Trump supporter Geoffrey Palmer, the president added another $4 million to his tally. On Wednesday, he\u2019s expected to bring the trip\u2019s grand total to $15 million with a Los Angeles breakfast and San Diego luncheon.\n\nThat\u2019s $15 million in a single state in less than 24 hours. By comparison, Kamala Harris raised $11.8 million nationwide during the entire second quarter of 2019.\n\nDemonstrators stand beside an inflatable chicken mocking President Trump as the presidential motorcade passes by in Palo Alto, Calif.

Back in June, the president\u2019s reelection campaign and two joint-fundraising committees raised nearly $25 million in a single day \u2014 an all-time record and more than any 2020 Democrat (other than Pete Buttigieg) has raised in an entire quarter. Then Trump and his various committees announced that they had amassed $108 million in the second quarter of 2019, surpassing even Barack Obama\u2019s haul from the equivalent period of his 2012 reelection campaign. Overall, Team Trump has raised $204 million to date for 2020, which is more than every Democrat combined.\n\nThe usual fear about such huge sums of cash \u2014 which could eventually total as much as $2 billion, if the wildest GOP predictions are to be believed \u2014 is that Trump and his allies could spend it on data, organization and advertising while Democrats are busy tearing each other apart, leaving the party\u2019s eventual nominee at a financial disadvantage next fall.\n\nPerhaps. But fundraising isn\u2019t everything. Remember, Hillary Clinton outspent Trump two-to-one in 2016. She still lost. That year, Trump benefited from an estimated $5 billion in free earned media coverage, and cable news isn\u2019t likely to stop covering his transgressions anytime soon. In this Trumpian media climate, who\u2019s airing the most ads in Michigan eventually stops mattering as much as it once did.\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t stop mattering, however, is energy and enthusiasm. And that\u2019s what should worry Democrats about Trump\u2019s trip to California.", "description": "When President Trump arrived in California Tuesday, Democrats saw his arrival as a platform for protest, but there's another reason his visit should concern them.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sE4tSam_DlxHJeqFWz0F4g--~B/aD0xNzc1O3c9MjY2MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/6ff5bc00-da13-11e9-bed6-929e505bd60e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
