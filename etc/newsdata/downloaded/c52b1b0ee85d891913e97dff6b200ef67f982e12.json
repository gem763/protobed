According to a police report, Brown was \u201cvery agitated\u201d over $80,000 and a handgun that had apparently gone missing.\n\nAntonio Brown had previously settled a lawsuit from the grandfather of a boy he allegedly almost hit with hurled furniture. (Getty Images)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe receiver\u2019s former landlords are reportedly seeking north of $15,000 in damages for Brown\u2019s treatment of the $35,000 per month apartment, but their lawyer George Minski claimed the actual property damage was more in the range of $80,000.\n\nThis lawsuit is still ongoing, and video of the incident, at least from the pool-goers\u2019 perspective, has now emerged.\n\nVideo shows furniture landing in pool\n\nSurveillance footage at the pool that emerged Tuesday shows the surreal scene that played out as Brown allegedly raged upstairs.\n\nThe young boy nearly hit can be seen wandering in the video.\n\nA photo of a shattered mirror, dented wall and damaged chandelier were also released as evidence of the property damage. We\u2019ll see how much that ends up costing Brown, who still has bigger legal and professional problems in front of him.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The former Steelers, Raiders and Patriots wide receiver is accused of trashing a condo and throwing furniture out of a high-rise window.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OIiqVwl2HPpm.6WANjax8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MjguOA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m9kqlmPsqyfXK5y1i6oGeA--~B/aD0xMjk1O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/2402a9e0-dd4f-11e9-af5b-fdb75cb68d6a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
