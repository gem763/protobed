Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe veteran right-handed pitcher will start Game Three of the World Series on Friday where the host Nationals will look to take a commanding 3-0 lead over the Houston Astros in the best-of-seven championship.\n\nSanchez has been stellar in the postseason for the Nationals and, while he will have had a two-week layoff between starts by the time he takes the mound on Friday, he said he is not at all concerned about any rust.\n\n\u201cI just think most of the time, like right now probably you need to rest because I\u2019ve been throwing baseball since February, probably January,\u201d Sanchez told reporters on Thursday. \u201cSo right now it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to affect you.\u201d\n\nSanchez has been excellent in his two starts this postseason, during which he has a 1-0 record with a miniscule 0.71 earned run average.\n\nWhen Sanchez took the mound in the National League Division Series it was on 10 days rest and he looked solid as he struck out nine batters through five innings before leaving a game his team went on to lose.\n\nSanchez was even better in his next outing as he took a no-hit bid into the eighth inning of the NL Championship Series opener against St. Louis.\n\nIt has been a remarkable turnaround considering Sanchez, in his first season with a Nats team that boasts a highly touted rotation featuring Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Game Four starter Patrick Corbin, started the year 0-6 after nine starts.\n\nBut Sanchez, who resurrected a career that seemed all but over after a miserable three-year stretch with the Tigers from 2015-17, went 11-2 the rest of the regular season.\n\n\u201cEverybody talks about our big three, but Anibal has pitched unbelievable,\u201d said Nationals manager Dave Martinez. \u201cHe gives us a chance to win ball games every outing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got great command of all his pitches, which is a lot. Hopefully he goes out and keeps us in the ball game and we have a chance to win again.\u201d", "description": "Anibal Sanchez contemplated retiring from Major League Baseball in the past but rejuvenated his career and now has a chance to put the Washington Nationals on the cusp of a World Series title in the biggest game of his life.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444688863&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O01G-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
