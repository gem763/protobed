CNN\u2019s Martin Savidge traveled to this rural area to speak to voters and found that many of them plan to cast their vote for President Trump. Savidge tells viewers:\n\nOnce a Democratic stronghold, many of the voters we talk to here say more and more, they align with the President. This is mining country. Not coal mining, but taconite, a mineral used in making steel. Forty or fifty years ago, the Iron Range, as it\u2019s called, was booming bringing big city prosperity to small towns like Eveleth.\n\nSavidge asked the town\u2019s mayor, Robert Vlaisavljevich, \u201cAre we talking thousands of people sort of shifting and changing their politics?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the mayor. \u201cOh, yeah\u2026Things were just going gangbusters, businesses all over. Then when it crashed, everybody was caught by surprise. It crashed hard.\u201d\n\nSavidge narrates: The number of mining jobs in the region went from over 14,000 in the 1980s to just about 4,500 today, leaving families and main streets to suffer.\n\nVlaisavljevich has been the mayor of Eveleth for eighteen years on and off. He votes Democratic in state races. But he\u2019s got a Trump sticker on his desk, a Christmas card from the President on his bulletin board and the deer on his office wall sports a MAGA hat.\n\nSavidge asks, \u201cThe political support for the President, part of that is just survival?\u201d\n\nThe mayor replies, \u201cEconomics\u2026He\u2019s our guy. He supports mining. He\u2019s our guy.\u201d\n\nSavidge spoke with a couple, perhaps in their fifties. The man said, \u201cHer brothers were staunch union Democrats for years and they\u2019re not anymore.\u201d\n\nSavidge tells viewers that \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs on imported steel are popular. So is his easing of environmental regulations. They also like his crackdown on immigration.\u201d\n\nHe shifts gears. \u201cIn a state that\u2019s 80% white, the influx of Somali refugees has been a contentious issue. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar is a controversial figure here.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said, \u201cShe offends a lot of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSavidge says, \u201cshe\u2019s not popular here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d responds the mayor.\n\n\u201cFolks here say they didn\u2019t leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left them.\u201d\n\nMinnesota has voted Democratic in most presidential elections since 1932. Nixon won the state in 1972. Since then, no Republican has prevailed in the state. Not even Reagan in 1984.\n\nIn 2016, Trump came close, but lost the state by 1.5%, or 44,765 votes out of nearly 2,700,000 cast. It\u2019s possible, with even a small shift away from the Democratic Party in the rural areas, that Trump could carry the state in 2020. And I\u2019m sure he will try.\n\nWatch the video.\n\nCNN's Martin Savidge speaks with voters in a Democratic stronghold in Minnesota as local attitudes about politics begin to shift.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nDemocratic voter on President Trump: He's our guy pic.twitter.com/EOvAUQ6eHU \u2014 TrumpPatriot\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@TrumpPatriotPL) September 20, 2019", "description": "CNN Speaks To Voters In What\u2019s Always Been A Democratic Stronghold In MN; He Hears The Unexpected", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/minnesota.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
