Managing ownership, especially in an early-stage company or small business, is one of the messiest, most-confusing things you\u2019ll ever have to do as an entrepreneur. Yet somehow, potential hires in the U.S. have come to expect an offer that includes equity anytime they\u2019re an early employee.\n\nStartups began using equity as a form of compensation decades ago, but nowadays it seems anyone and everyone thinks they deserve a piece of the pie. And in many cases, they are getting a share. It\u2019s not a question anymore of whether or not you should give equity \u2014 it\u2019s how much.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s shocking. Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019ve seen the ugly side of how sharing ownership without thinking it through can cost you. I had a business partner until a few years ago, and one day he decided he was done. But unwinding that partnership wasn\u2019t so simple.\n\nUnfortunately, I had failed to take the right steps to protect myself. Things got ugly. By the time he finally left the office I had spent a significant amount of money on legal fees, the entire business had experienced lost production, and I was in need of several stiff drinks just to recover from the ordeal.\n\nGiving away equity doesn\u2019t have to be the norm. Here\u2019s what to consider and how to protect yourself if decide to offer employees a stake in the business:\n\n1. Minority owners have unintended rights and responsibilities: Whether you\u2019re granting straight equity, a vesting stock plan, or some other form of ownership, you\u2019re giving your employees unintended access and rights that some should never have.\n\nIn most cases, minority owners can request and have access to all of your financials, whether you like it or not. And they can take part in voting for board seats and in some cases hold even more sway over the overall governance and direction of the company.\n\nWhen you give away equity, you\u2019re not just incentivizing employees, you\u2019re giving them real power and leverage.\n\nWhen everyone\u2019s getting along, this might not be a concern, but what happens if you need to fire someone? An employee with access to your financials, the ability to vote or block certain board members, and possibly even more leverage, can do serious damage before they\u2019re shown the door.\n\nWhen you give away equity, you\u2019re not just incentivizing employees, you\u2019re giving them real power and leverage. That includes employee stock-ownership plans, or ESOPs, where everyone has to be included in the stock plan. If an ESOP borrows to pay for stock it can put incredible financial and cash-flow pressure on the company. It also has no investment diversity and, if the company has a downturn, must pay laid-off employees, putting even more pressure on cash flow.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative, if you decide to grant any kind of ownership, in any form, that you cover all of your paperwork bases up front, while everyone is still getting along.\n\nThe most critical part of this puzzle \u2014 the one I screwed up \u2014 is ensuring you have a buy and sell agreement. It\u2019s a legally binding agreement that stipulates what happens to ownership units in the event that the employee leaves the company, for whatever reason.\n\nA buy and sell agreement certainly won\u2019t block all possible disputes, but it\u2019s a tool that gives you a clear picture of how things will end \u2014 namely, with the ownership units coming back to the company, and you avoiding the nightmare I endured.\n\n2. The tax conundrum:You can\u2019t grant equity or ownership without incurring a tax event. The moment you do, you create a cascade effect that will end up where you, the employee, or both of you are paying the IRS for the transaction to take place.\n\nBefore you take that step, ensure you\u2019ve reviewed all of your options. You don\u2019t want to saddle a key team member or your business with a high tax bill.\n\nOne option is to use an 83(b) election when granting equity, giving the employee the option to pay taxes on the current value of the company \u2014 which in theory could be quite low or even zero in the early stages \u2014 rather than on the company\u2019s valuation later on.\n\nOffer performance bonuses instead\n\nEquity or a vested-stock plan are often dangled as carrots that keep employees engaged and give them a stake in the long-term health of the company. But I\u2019m going to tell you exactly what I tell my clients: there are other ways to do the same thing.\n\nIf it\u2019s a matter of compensation, offer a bonus program that doesn\u2019t dilute ownership. Only hand out the cash when you\u2019ve achieved a benchmark and your incentives still align. Entrepreneurs and small business owners put in hundreds of thousands or even millions of their own dollars into their ventures, not to mention their time and effort.\n\nYou are not obligated to give that up. You don\u2019t owe anything to someone who wasn\u2019t there when you had to drain your savings to get the company started, or when you stayed up nights to meet a deadline before you had any employees.\n\nMaybe you feel like equity is the only way to lure someone or retain a key member of your team. If you\u2019re hiring engineers in Silicon Valley, that might be true. Anywhere else, though, and you should ask yourself if that\u2019s really the case.\n\nBefore giving away equity, consider the risks it creates for your company, both financially and legally. Lock yourself in a room with your most trusted advisers and go through every possible scenario. Keep in mind that just because everyone\u2019s getting along well now doesn\u2019t mean that will always be so.\n\nI realize there may be times where equity is a necessary part of a compensation package, but there are also many, many instances where it doesn\u2019t have to be. Granting ownership comes with a price, and sooner or later you\u2019ll have to pay it. Just make sure it\u2019s worth it when you do.\n\nBruce Willey has advised small- to midsize businesses for more than a decade, helping them navigate business and tax law, as well as asset protection, exit planning, and estate planning.\n\nRead: The smartest business owners don\u2019t open a 529 plan \u2014 they hire their kids instead\n\nMore: Want a pension in retirement?
