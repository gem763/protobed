She walked into Woodside and the first thing she said was: 'I'd forgotten how small this place is.'\n\n\u201cI was determined not to rise to the bait. Instead, I asked if she wanted to see the kids, who were playing upstairs. She said no.\u201d\n\nHe ended her visit by telling her he loved her.\n\nSheila replied: \u201cI love you, too\u2026 But I don't like you at all.\u201d\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography is due to release on October 15, 2019\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
