Nothing seemed particularly strange about it, except maybe the name: Notepad++ v7.8.1 is the \u201cFree Uyghur\u201d edition.\n\nDeveloper writes about plight of the Uyghur people\n\nIn a blog post announcing the updated version, developer Don Ho writes about the plight of the Uyghur people, an ethnic minority in China that\u2019s faced persecution from the country\u2019s authoritarian government. China operates internment camps that are used to detain Uyghur people throughout the country\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n\n\u201cThe fact you have just learned such information is already an action in and of itself,\u201d Ho writes in the announcement. \u201cBut you can involve more people to focus on this issue and hopefully apply additional pressure on the Chinese government to stop their oppressive actions and crimes concerning the Uyghur people.\u201d\n\nWhile the protest may have been innocuous enough, it hasn\u2019t played out that way online. Since the announcement, the software\u2019s GitHub \u201cissues\u201d page has been bombarded with spam, much of it in the Chinese language.\n\n\u201cStop sending meaningless political-related issues, it just makes you look like an idiot,\u201d reads one comment. Another one simply reads, \u201cBye ! Uninstall.\u201d There\u2019s a litany of curses, and one asks, \u201cWhat do you know about China?\u201d Others have moved in to criticize the Chinese government in response.\n\nFor software like Notepad++, the GitHub page is an important resource, and having it unavailable could be a headache for some users. Previous versions of the software have, in the past, been named in political protest, and one even referenced the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Ho writes in the announcement that he anticipated potential pushback, saying \u201ctalking about politics is exactly what software and commercial companies generally try to avoid,\u201d but decided to take the step anyway.\n\n\u201cThe problem is,\u201d Ho writes in the announcement of the Free Uyghur edition, \u201cif we don\u2019t deal with politics, politics will deal with us.\u201d", "description": "This week, the developer of the popular note-taking software Notepad++ released a new version update.
