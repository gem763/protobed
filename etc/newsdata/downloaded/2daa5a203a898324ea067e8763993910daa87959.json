The change of mind reportedly came after Pentagon officials persuaded the president that it was essential to protect east Syrian oil resources.\n\n\u201cKeep the oil, I\u2019ve always said that. We\u2019ve secured the oil,\u201d Trump told a police chiefs\u2019 conference on Monday. The president has said that his aim would be to secure a US share of Syrian oil revenues, which is potentially a war crime.\n\nThe defense secretary, Mark Esper, claimed that the objective of the deployment was to guard the oil fields to prevent the revenues benefiting Isis but also to keep them out of Syrian regime or Russian control, so that the benefits went to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that SDF does have access to those resources in order to guard the prisons, in order to arm their own troops in order to assist us with the defeat Isis mission,\u201d Esper said.\n\nTrump has defended his decision to abandon the SDF, saying it was not America\u2019s job to police a longstanding conflict between Turks and Kurds, but Esper said that the US troops remaining in Syria those who remain would be \u201cstaying in close contact with the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have fought alongside us\u201d.\n\nHe would not say whether the deployment meant that there were more or less US soldiers in Syria than before Trump ordered the withdrawal last month, paving the way for Turkey\u2019s invasion into north-eastern Syria. But the defense secretary insisted that: \u201cAt the end of the day we will be sending troops home.\u201d\n\nEsper and Milley gave few new details about the Saturday raid on a compound near the Syrian-Turkish border which led to Baghdadi\u2019s death when he detonated a suicide vest in a tunnel.\n\nRelated: 'He died as he lived \u2013 a coward': Isis victims' relatives on Baghdadi's death\n\n\u201cBaghdadi\u2019s remains were then transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done, and is complete, and was handled appropriately,\u201d Milley said. He would not confirm a Fox News report that the remains had been buried at sea, like those of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nHe said that two men had been captured alive at the compound and were in US custody in an unspecified location.\n\nMilley said he could not confirm Trump\u2019s claim that Baghdadi had been \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d as he fled US forces in a tunnel at the compound.\n\n\u201cThe president had planned a talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d the general said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the source of that was, but I assume it was talking directly to unit.\u201d\n\nThe husband of Baghdadi\u2019s wife\u2019s sister has emerged as one of the key figures in the hunt for the Isisi leader. According to Iraqi intelligence officials, Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie led them to a desert tunnel on the Iraqi Syrian border, where items linked to the Isis leader were found. The Iraqis say they found a weapon, medical bags, religious books and a small handbag containing maps and hand-drawn locations inside the cache.\n\nFrom that starting point, the smuggler who proved central to the hunt was located, as was one of Baghdadi\u2019s wives and a nephew. All three were co-opted, and they led Iraqis and Syrian Kurds who had then been enlisted by the CIA to northern Idlib province, near an area called Jebel al-Druze in the beginning of September.\n\nBaghdadi is thought to have not long been in the province and was regularly moving between a series of simple houses.\n\nSeparately, Kurdish intelligence efforts pinpointed the location of Isis spokesman, Abu Hasan al-Muhajir near the town of Jarabulus on the Turkish border. Al-Muhajir was killed by a US airstrike on Sunday afternoon, only hours after Baghdadi\u2019s demise.", "description": "Trump has said he hopes to secure a US share of Syrian oil revenues, which is potentially a war crimeA convoy of US military vehicles, arriving from northern Iraq, drives along a road in the countryside of Syria\u2019s north-eastern city of Qamishli on 26 October 2019.
