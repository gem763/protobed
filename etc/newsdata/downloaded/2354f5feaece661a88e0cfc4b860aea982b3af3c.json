USA TODAY\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump used some of his time at an important press conference to take a shot at Steve Kerr over the Golden State Warriors coach opting to give the situation between the NBA and China more thought before he gave an answer.\n\nTrump said that Kerr \"was like a little boy, he was so scared to be even answering the question. He couldn't answer the question \u2014 he was shaking, 'Oh, oh, oh, I don't know. I don't know. He didn't know how to answer the question, and yet he'll talk about the United States very badly.\"\n\nKerr, of course, wasn't shaking like a little boy when he spoke.\n\nOn Thursday, Kerr addressed Trump's comments. The Warriors coach brought up a story about when he and his mom were invited to the White House in 1984 by President Ronald Regan shortly after Kerr's dad was killed in a terrorist attack.\n\nKerr's father, if you didn't know, was assassinated while serving as the president of American University in Lebanon.\n\nHere's Kerr's thoughtful answer, in which he says he was the \"shiny object\" for Trump to be mad at that day, saying, \"mainly just because it was me. Then you stop and you think, this is just every day. This is just another day. I was the shiny object yesterday. There was another one today, there will be a new one tomorrow. And the circus will go on. It's just strange, but it happened.\"\n\nKerr hopes in 2020 we can have someone in office who can bring America back together again.\n\nSteve Kerr\u2019s full response to Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/UWkzuJKYpM \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 11, 2019\n\nFollow For The Win's Andy Nesbitt on Twitter @anezbitt.", "description": "A day after Donald Trump took a shot at Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach responded by saying that he \"was the shiny object yesterday.\"", "authors": ["Andy Nesbitt", "Published P.M.
