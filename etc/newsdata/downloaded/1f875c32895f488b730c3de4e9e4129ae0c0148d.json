It was five minutes \u2014 an eternity \u2014 away.\n\nStories of unlikely survival have slowly emerged in the days since Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas, pummelling the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco for days before moving towards the Atlantic Seaboard.\n\nWhile the damage has been visible from above, the full human toll is still far from certain, with 30 deaths confirmed so far and authorities warning that the real number may be much higher.\n\nThe death count \u201ccould be staggering,\u201d Dr Duane Sands, the minister of health, who updated the toll late Thursday.\n\nSome neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble, almost entirely flattened by the storm. In others, 95 per cent of homes have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThousands of people are now homeless, taking refuge in gyms or churches, and authorities are bracing for an influx of bodies as the extent of the destruction becomes clear.\n\nWhen Hurricane Dorian first made landfall on Sunday, Mr Lowe recalled, all of its fury seemed to bear down on him.\n\nThe storm raging outside was one of the most powerful ever to sweep through the Atlantic. Its eye was approaching, and the group of eight people inside Mr Lowe\u2019s cement house were particularly vulnerable.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Among them were two children.\n\nAs the storm howled around them, he said the roof began to lift off, then slap back down.\n\nAbaco withstood sustained winds of up to 185mph that day, with gusts that reached 220mph.\n\nThe group sought safety in the bathroom, where they huddled together and prayed, hoping for relief. Mr Lowe\u2019s son was nestled inside the bathtub.\n\nThat is when the roof flew away.\n\nExposed to the elements, each person had to step out into the storm. They clung to each other and set out to find refuge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like that in my life,\u201d said M Lowe, who is no stranger to hurricanes but said he could never have imagined the terror of that day.\n\nThe group reached a neighbour's house. Mr Lowe and his son hunkered down there for a day until a rescue bus was able to pick them up on Monday and take them to a shelter.\n\nOn Tuesday night, he was evacuated to Nassau, where he can get the dialysis treatment he needs three times a week. His son had to stay in Abaco, in the care of Mr Lowe\u2019s sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cI came here with the clothes that I had on from Saturday,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the father and son are now safe, his ordeal is, in some ways, only beginning.\n\nHe did not know if his eldest daughter made it through the storm. The phone lines have been down for days and communication with Abaco is very difficult.\n\n\u201cRight before we had the wind, I spoke with her,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could have been able to call and ask somebody, you know, because I really was worried about them. I was worried about everybody.\u201d\n\nSo many people have been pushed from their homes by the hurricane that in Marsh Harbour, the main town on Abaco, as many as 2,000 people were seeking shelter in a clinic and a government complex. Officials warned that tent cities might have to be set up to accommodate the many survivors.\n\nBahamian officials urged their citizens to be unified.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to convey the grief we feel for our fellow Bahamians in the Abacos and Grand Bahama,\u201d Dionisio D\u2019Aguilar, the tourism and aviation minister, said in a statement. \u201cNow is the time to come together for our brothers and sisters in need, and help our country get back on its feet.\u201d\n\nLike many of his neighbours, Mr Lowe is now homeless. After a lifetime on the outskirts of Marsh Harbour \u2014 where he raised a family and worked as a butcher in a fish house until he lost his eyesight to diabetes \u2014 his home, his community and everything he built has been obliterated.\n\nStill, he wants to return to Abaco.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where my family is. My kids are there; my brothers, my sisters, they\u2019re all there.\u201d\n\nBut he is unsure of its future. The damage is catastrophic.\n\nIn the area where he lived, he said that \u201c90 per cent of the houses are compromised\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m talking about roofs gone, houses totally collapsed everywhere.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m just wondering where we\u2019re going to live when I go back home, what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The roof had blown clean off.
