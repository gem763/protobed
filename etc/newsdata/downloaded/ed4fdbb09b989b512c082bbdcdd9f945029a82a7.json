Once owner Dan Gilbert and general manager Koby Altman sat down with Beilein, it didn\u2019t take long for them to realize he was the person they needed.\n\nBeilein appears to be an ideal fit.\n\n\u201cWith young guys you need a culture first and you can\u2019t just build that,\u201d said forward Larry Nance, who expanded his game last season. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw a culture in and hope it works. You have to start from the bottom. I don\u2019t want to say he\u2019s starting from the bottom, but within the league, he\u2019s fresh. He\u2019s starting new. We\u2019re starting new. It\u2019s good that nobody is really above the other.\u201d\n\nBeilein inherits a team that went 19-63 last season, the inevitable freefall sealed when LeBron James packed up and left Cleveland for the second time as a free agent. It didn\u2019t help that All-Star forward Kevin Love was limited to just 22 games after undergoing toe surgery.\n\nFrom the start of training camp, Beilein has gone old school with the Cavs, who were more than a little stunned when he had them doing elementary-level movements normally seen in grade school practices.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t done the Mikan drill in like 12 years,\u201d said Nance, referring to the time-tested exercise for basketball big men.\n\nBeilein\u2019s firmly believes even pros need to brush up on the basics.\n\n\u201cThe veterans understand that there is slippage in the fundamentals, especially over a summer,\u201d Beilein said. \u201cThere\u2019s just incredible slippage and you have to remind them of that. It\u2019s not their fault. \u2026 For the good veterans it\u2019s like riding a bike, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, yeah, I should have boxed out there.\u2019 But you have to train them and keep it going.\u201d\n\nBeilein\u2019s next challenge is to keep the Cavs from going in reverse.\n\nLOVE STATUS\n\nWithout fail, Love begins another season encircled in trade talk.\n\nIt\u2019s been that way since he arrived in Cleveland, where he\u2019s gone from having a supporting role alongside James and Kyrie Irving on title contenders to being the Cavs\u2019 unquestioned top player and most important leader on a sub-.500 squad.\n\nLove doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere, and he\u2019s committed to nurturing his young teammates. However, the Cavs could be tempted to trade him for a package of players and/or picks that could hasten their turnaround.\n\nDYNAMITE DUO\n\nThe Cavs are counting on Garland, the No. 5 overall pick this season, and Collin Sexton to blossom into one of the league\u2019s best backcourts. Based purely on skill level and upside, the pair is already drawing comparisons to Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.\n\nGarland played only five games at Vanderbilt before a left knee injury ended his college career. He\u2019s got all the tools, the right makeup and has an NBA pedigree as his father, Winston, played eight seasons in the league. Durability seems to be the only question mark about Garland.\n\nSECOND SEASON\n\nSexton\u2019s rookie season went from poor to polished.\n\nStung by being left off the NBA\u2019s rising stars team at the break, the speedy guard kicked his game into overdrive. He improved in all areas and wound up averaging 16.7 points on 43% shooting - 21 points and 48% in the second half. He\u2019s got a scorer\u2019s mentality, but the Cavs need him to do other things and he added some muscle during the offseason to prevent other guards from pushing him around.\n\nOTHER ROOKIES\n\nThe Cavs added two other interesting rookies with first-round picks - swingman Dylan Windler and Kevin Porter Jr.\n\nWindler averaged 21.3 points, 10.8 rebounds and carried tiny Belmont to its first NCAA Tournament win. The Cavs like Windler\u2019s versatility and shooting range. He\u2019s been slowed by a leg injury so far.\n\nA five-star high school recruit, Porter was suspended from USC\u2019s team for bad behavior. The slim 6-foot-6 left-hander has all the moves, and he could provide Cleveland with scoring punch off the bench.\n\nGOLDEN YEAR\n\nThe Cavs are celebrating their 50th season, which began with two unfortunate incidents - owner Dan Gilbert\u2019s stroke and longtime broadcaster Fred McLeod\u2019s death.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Beilein stood at midcourt with his arms folded and watched as the Cavaliers pushed through practice drills that the former Michigan coach developed and perfected during 37 years at the college level.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/san_lorenzo_cavaliers_basketball_00150_c0-188-4066-2559_s1200x700.jpg?795bf347e242bd16d90325eb3aba39cc05e11dec", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
