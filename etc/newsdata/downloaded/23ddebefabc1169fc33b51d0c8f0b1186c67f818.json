We look forward to working with many of them.\"\n\nJim Tucker, a partner at KPMG and joint special manager of Thomas Cook\u2019s retail division, said: \u201cThis is an extremely positive outcome, and we are delighted to have secured this agreement.\n\n\u201cIt provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\nHays Travel said it plans to re-open the Thomas Cook stores with \u201cimmediate effect where possible and to take on up to 2,500 people\u201d.\n\nMore than 100 new jobs will be based at the firm's Sunderland headquarters with the rest in shops across the UK.\n\nAnd Hays aren't the only people offering jobs to former staff of the collapsed giant.\n\nVirgin Atlantic said it's offering jobs: \"To support any Thomas Cook Cabin Crew after the sad announcement that the company has ceased operations.\"\n\n\"This opening is for current Thomas Cook Cabin Crew or Thomas Cook employees with previous flying experience only,\" the job ad reads.\n\nYou can apply online, or send to a friend, here .\n\nStaff at Thomas Cook's biggest rival Tui are also offering a helping hand.\n\n\"We are sorry to learn of the Thomas Cook UK news.
