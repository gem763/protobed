Other candidates aren't so sure", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren speaks during the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nThroughout the fourth Democratic presidential debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) continued to argue for breaking up big tech companies, but not everyone on the stage was ready to take that stand.\n\nWarren has made taking on big tech one of her biggest campaign promises. Leading up to the debate, she publicly sparred with Facebook over its policy for political ads and vowed to turn down large donations from big tech executives.\n\n\u201cI'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back,\u201d said Warren during the debate.\n\nWarren went on to specifically call out Amazon.\n\n\u201cIt collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating,\u201d said Warren.\n\nWhile the other candidates repeatedly expressed concerns about competition, they did not explicitly call for breaking up the companies. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang questioned whether it would be realistic.\n\n\u201cCompetition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThat would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true. It\u2019s not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country.\u201d\n\nTwelve Democratic U.S. presidential candidates debate during the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton More\n\nYang argued the better solution would be allowing consumers to own their own data.\n\n\u201cRight now, our data is worth more than oil,\u201d said Yang. \u201cIf we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) made the case that a president or candidate shouldn\u2019t decide which companies should be broken up, but there should be rules of the road in place for social media companies.\n\n\u201cRight now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when, in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cTreat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) raised concerns about anti-competitive behavior and big tech\u2019s influence on elections. He said there is need for \u201cregulation and reform,\u201d but didn\u2019t call for breaking up the companies. \u201cWe have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws,\u201d said Booker.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) highlighted her legislation to modernize antitrust laws, with the goal of encouraging more competition. \u201cChanging the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed,\u201d said Klobuchar. \u201cStart talking about this as a pro-competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about breaking up big tech, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) pivoted to attack Warren and pressure her to call on Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account. Warren brushed off the request.\n\n\u201cLook, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,\u201d Warren said.\n\nJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
