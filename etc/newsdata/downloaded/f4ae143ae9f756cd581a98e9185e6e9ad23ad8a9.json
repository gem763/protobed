Look for a minimum of 0.1%.\u2019\n\nAcids: AHAs and glycolics help shift pigmentation by shedding the top layers of skin. \u2018Start gradually, using an AHA face wash once or twice a week. Or alternate retinol at night with a glycolic toner. Be careful not to overdo acids alongside retinol or you\u2019re asking for irritation.\u2019\n\nVitamin C: \u2018Use in the morning. The best form is l-ascorbic acid, and at least 10% strength.\u2019\n\nDaily SPF50: Non-negotiable. \u2018If you don\u2019t use it, your pigmentation will come back. If you can\u2019t commit to using it, everything else is a waste of money.\u2019\n\nTranexamic acid is a clotting agent originally used for women with heavy periods, but it\u2019s also been found to disrupt pigmentation production, says Dr Mahto.\n\n\u2018Dermatologists are now using it off-license in short, sharp doses for melasma.\u2019\n\nIt can be prescribed it orally, but it\u2019s just starting to appear in skin products like SkinCeuticals Discoloration Defence, \u00a385.\n\nAnti-pigmentation products: \u2018Formulas which target the enzymes involved in melanin production are worth including,\u2019 says Dr Mahto.\n\nHere are three of the latest formulas picked by Notebook\u2019s beauty team:\n\nEucerin Anti-Pigment Serum, \u00a338, uses a new active, thiamidol, to disrupt melanin. In a trial graded by dermatologists, it kept improving pigmentation over 12 weeks.\n\nDr Dennis Gross PRO IPL Dark Spot Concentrated Serum, \u00a399, is pricey but packs a punch with 15% l-ascorbic acid, AHAs, lactic acid and licorice root. It claims to \u2018rival 4% prescription strength hydroquinone\u2019.\n\nBoots No7 Laboratories Dark Spot Correcting Booster Serum, \u00a338, claims it\u2019s \u2018clinically proven\u2019 to reduce dark spots. In trials, testers saw effects from as soon as two weeks.\n\nIs it worth seeing a dermatologist?\n\nA dermatologist will be able to check your pigmentation is just that and nothing more sinister.\n\nThey can also offer stronger treatments like hydroquinone.\n\n\u2018This is very effective and safe when used properly, but it\u2019s prescription-only because if you use it for too long you can get a \u2018rebound\u2019 pigmentation that\u2019s blue toned and very hard to remove,\u2019 says Dr Mahto.\n\nSo definitely don\u2019t be tempted to buy your own hydroquinone stash from the internet.\n\nDermatologists can also offer laser and IPL treatment, which can be very effective at zapping sun spots - but needs to be carried out by an expert.\n\n\u2018I would advise against using IPL or laser with melasma,\u2019 says Dr Williams.\n\n\u2018You will get a lightening effect initially but then usually you get a rebound a few months later and could end up worse than you started.\u2019\n\nWhat\u2019s the fastest way to shift pigmentation?\n\nIf 12 weeks sounds too long to wait, there is a quicker way, but be warned - it is the nuclear option.\n\n(Image: Eudelo)\n\n\u2018Specialist medium-depth peels give outstanding results if you can deal with the downtime,\u2019 says Dr Williams.\n\n\u2018Eudelo\u2019s MelaOut peel reduces pigmentation by as much as 50% in four weeks and 80% after 12, but you can expect swelling and redness next day, followed by 1-3 weeks of flaking.\n\nYou\u2019d definitely need to take a few days off work, but patients feel the results are worth it.\u2019\n\n(Image: Eudelo)\n\nThere are lighter peels with less downtime but it\u2019s the full-on flaking that really blasts off the pigmentation.\n\nDr Stefanie Williams is medical director at Eudelo.\n\nDr Anjali Mahto is author of The Skincare Bible and consultant dermatologist at 55 Harley Street.", "description": "If pigmentation is the price you\u2019ve paid for this summer\u2019s record-breaking sunshine, here\u2019s what you need to know about fading it", "authors": ["Lynne Hyland", "Image", "Getty", "Eudelo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20379985.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-1171250814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
