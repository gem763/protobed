Compelled by a lawsuit, the Food and Drug Administration is releasing thousands of never-before-seen documents regarding the most controversial drug approval in many years. And these documents are beginning to reveal the inner workings of a government agency that\u2019s being torn apart by conflicting loyalties.\n\n\u201cThe story of how this unfolded really was extraordinary.\u201d\n\nLate last year, the FDA approved eteplirsen, a potentially lifesaving drug for young boys (and in rare cases, girls) doomed to die from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an incurable degenerative disease. That the approval was controversial is an understatement: In approving the drug, the agency overruled its own scientific advisers, rejected the recommendations of its review panel, triggered a formal internal dispute process, and apparently sparked the resignation of one senior official and the retirement of another.\n\nThe approval also failed to quash doubts about whether the drug, in fact, works \u2014 and it raised questions about how well the agency fulfilled its legal and scientific obligations to ensure that the drugs Americans use are both safe and effective.\n\nEvidence of deep disagreement within the FDA over the decision to approve eteplirsen began to surface almost immediately after the FDA issued its go-ahead last September. Central to the tension was the decision by Janet Woodcock, the director of the agency\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, to issue the approval despite the contrary opinions of experts empaneled by the agency to review the drug.\n\nBut the new documents being released by the FDA \u2014 a response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by this reporter to get additional information about eteplirsen\u2019s approval \u2014 are now shining added light on the level of internal discord that accompanied the drug\u2019s review. Chief among the new revelations: charges by one high-ranking official that Woodcock, an FDA employee for three decades, skirted established norms, bypassed multiple layers of FDA expertise and authority, and even ignored calls for more thorough studies in greenlighting the controversial drug.\n\nIn an email dated September 14, 2016 and addressed to Robert Califf, then head of the FDA, John Jenkins, then the head of the Office of New Drugs and one of the officials who left in the wake of the eteplirsen approval, makes a number of blistering allegations regarding Woodcock\u2019s decision to ignore the advice of the eteplirsen review team. Such review teams, typically comprised of dozens of physicians, pharmacologists, statisticians, and various other experts, weigh clinical evidence for a drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness and decide whether or not the drug should be allowed on the U.S. market.\n\nThe team\u2019s decisions can be contentious, and sometimes higher-ups have to settle disputes. However, for a center director to overrule a review team is \u201crather exceptional,\u201d said Michael Carome, director of the health research group at the nonprofit group Public Citizen. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen circumstances like this, especially with such unanimity by the review team that prepared such a detailed analysis.\u201d\n\nIn his email, Jenkins alleges that Woodcock short-circuited normal agency procedures, including the review team\u2019s desire to require better-quality data in a new trial of eteplirsen. \u201c[I]t was Janet that pressed that a new randomized trial not be required,\u201d Jenkins wrote. \u201cSo, if Janet had followed the normal CDER process in this case the review team would have required placebo-controlled trials \u2026 and we would have better data on which to make a decision.\u201d\n\nJenkins also insisted that Woodcock\u2019s involvement in the eteplirsen decision \u2014 normally the domain of lower-ranking officials than the head of CDER \u2014 was abnormally intense, presumably putting pressure on the team to approve the drug. \u201cI have worked with Janet for over 20 years and I can say without a doubt that her involvement in this case far exceeds her usual \u2018hands on\u2019 approach,\u201d Jenkins wrote. \u201cYou note that there were 14 Center director briefings related to this case, that is clearly not the \u2018norm\u2019 for how CDER operates.\u201d\n\nFurther, writes Jenkins, the manner in which Woodcock overruled the review team effectively sidestepped several waypoints in what is normally a regimented series of interactions between various FDA subdivisions and managers and a new drug applicant \u2014 processes rarely, if ever, abrogated by the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cIn this case, that process was bypassed,\u201d Jenkins wrote.\n\nNeither Woodcock nor Jenkins would agree to speak on the record to Undark about the newly released correspondence, but according to Carome, the whole exchange casts a shadow over the FDA.\n\n\u201c[Woodcock] has the authority, and the chain of command is hers, but the story of how this unfolded really was extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cHer actions eviscerated longstanding procedures within the agency\u201d that ensure that FDA makes consistent decisions in the interest of public health.\n\nDiana Zuckerman, the president of the nonprofit National Center for Health Research, expressed similar concerns. \u201cI\u2019ve seen high-level FDA officials undercut their scientists at meetings, or where they clearly try to take a side,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never seen anything like this from a center director.\u201d\n\nEven more surprising than the alleged breaches of bureaucratic norms were Woodcock\u2019s alleged breaches of scientific ones. The FDA is required by law to allow a drug to market only based upon scientific evidence that the drug is safe and effective; nothing other than science should be the basis of a decision. Jenkins\u2019 memo backs up earlier allegations made by other FDA officials that Woodcock had decided to approve the drug not just before the review team had prepared its final report, but also well before a last round of crucial data were in.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s not following FDA\u2019s required procedures, the question is, why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be the mission of the FDA to give treatments to desperate patients because the desperate patients want the treatments,\u201d says Zuckerman, who worries that Woodcock is allowing patient desires to trump scientific evidence. \u201cThe role of the FDA is to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks.\u201d\n\nJenkins\u2019 memo also supports claims that Woodcock\u2019s decision to approve the drug was motivated, in part, by her worries about the financial solvency of Sarepta Therapeutics, the company trying to get eteplirsen approved. And the most serious allegation of all from Jenkins\u2019 memo is that Woodcock failed to follow FDA\u2019s set-in-stone procedures to log discussions with a drug company that has an application underway: \u201cJanet has had frequent private conversations with the sponsor and the stakeholder community,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo my knowledge, she has not documented the substance of those conversations to the record, as is required under FDA regulations.\u201d\n\nCarome called this \u201ca disturbing statement. \u201cIf she\u2019s not following FDA\u2019s required procedures,\u201d he said, \u201cthe question is why not?\u201d\n\nEven with the understanding that Jenkins\u2019 perceptions are clearly colored by his antipathy for Woodcock, the newly released documents would seem to illuminate a bureaucracy whose procedural and scientific rules were broken, one after the other, by an administrator determined to get a drug approved.\n\nThe reaction by Califf, the recipient of the emailed memo, was one word: \u201cOuch.\u201d\n\nCharles Seife is a professor of journalism at New York University, and the author of numerous book, including \u201cProofiness: The Dark Arts of Mathematical Deception.\u201d His work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Science, New Scientist, Scientific American, Wired, Slate, ProPublica, The Economist, and many other publications.", "description": "An internal email argues that the agency's director of drug evaluation ignored experts and skirted procedures in greenlighting a controversial drug.", "authors": ["Abigail Fagan", "Mark Kaufman", "Dan Robitzski", "Ashley Lyles", "Cici Zhang", "Phil Hilts", "Charles Seife", "A Mad Scientist", "The Truth", "Alan Goldhammer"], "top_image": "https://4al52k24l8r51wpym5i46ltd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/FDADA-1024x576.jpg", "published_at": "2017-08-05"}
