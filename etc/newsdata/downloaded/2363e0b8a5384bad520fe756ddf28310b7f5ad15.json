British ticket buyers have been particularly lucky this year, claiming a series of supersize jackpots.\n\nColin and Christine Weir (pictured) from Largs in North Ayrshire, Scotland, scooped the \u00a3161million EuroMillions jackpot in July 2011\n\nAndy Carter, senior winners' adviser at The National Lottery, said: 'It's been a fantastic year for UK EuroMillions players, with five jackpot wins.\n\nIn June, one ticket-holder, who chose to remain anonymous, became one of the UK's biggest-ever winners after scooping a \u00a3123million jackpot.'\n\nIn the New Year's Day draw, Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won \u00a3114.9million, Ade Goodchild scooped \u00a371million in March, while another anonymous ticket-holder bagged \u00a335.2million in April.\n\nIf this week's winner does not come forward, lottery company Camelot will wait at least two weeks before issuing details of the general area where the ticket was purchased. This will be an area with a population of at least 75,000 to ensure that any eventual winner can remain anonymous.", "description": "The punter beat odds of almost 140 million to one to scoop the EuroMillions jackpot which will catapult them into the list of the UK's 1,000 wealthiest people.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter Consumer Affairs Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19516644-0-image-a-65_1570663394142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
