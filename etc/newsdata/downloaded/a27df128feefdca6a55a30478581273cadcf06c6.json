'But he's not suffered a relapse. It's a reaction between the scar and the nerve. I understand that it'll take a bit of time to treat the scar.\n\n'He felt very free but now there's been a small reaction. When he feels that, he is not loose. I'm convinced that after a few days of treatment, he will be totally ready, as was the case before Bordeaux.\n\nMbappe joins Edinson Cavani on the sidelines as the pair look to shake off injuries\n\n'He's shown that he's capable of doing a lot of accelerations and sprints without feeling anything.'\n\nPSG, who are inundated with plenty of attacking options, are also without Edinson Cavani, who was scheduled to return before Mbappe but remains sidelined.\n\nTuchel said: 'I don't know, we'll have to wait until training. He trained on Thursday. He trained after Bordeaux but he told me he didn't feel 100%.\n\n'Thilo Kehrer, Julian Draxer and Colin Dagba, they are not with the team.\n\n'Thomas Meunier had treatment yesterday and will do a complete training session today, and we'll see after. He's played a lot and has small muscle pains in his thigh.'", "description": "The 20-year-old made a return last week when he set up fellow superstar Neymar in PSG's win over Bordeaux, and came off the bench on Tuesday during their Champions League win on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/18/19307590-0-image-a-5_1570208478141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
