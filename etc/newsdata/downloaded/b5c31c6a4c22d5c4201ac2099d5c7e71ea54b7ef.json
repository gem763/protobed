The broadcaster asked the five north-west Premier League clubs \u2013 Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and Burnley \u2013 whether they had done anything to support Bury during the crisis.\n\nCity are understood to have pointed out that Bury have had use of their former training ground at Carrington rent free for five years. Everton confirmed that they had explored with the EFL whether they could offer strategic support, and that Kenwright had discussed making a substantial financial contribution, understood to be in the region of \u00a31m, in a personal capacity.\n\nThe EFL responded that although the Premier League centrally does distribute \u201csolidarity\u201d money to the league, which is shared among the 72 clubs, an individual club or director cannot directly subsidise another club. The rules are designed to govern the competitive independence of clubs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bill Kenwright (right) stands beside Everton owner Farhad Moshiri at Goodison Park earlier this month.

Dale declared the club insolvent and entered into a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) in July but after he consistently failed to show the EFL proof that he could fund the CVA and a season in League One, Bury were expelled from the league in August.\n\nDebts under the CVA are understood not to have been paid at all yet. Bury face a further winding-up petition in the high court on Wednesday, and the club, formed in 1885 and previously a Football League member since 1894, are expected to be put into liquidation.\n\nHowever, Bury said in a statement on Friday that the winding-up petition \u201cwill be dismissed\u201d and added: \u201cBury football club is not dead as some are asserting and will again be playing football.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Everton chairman Bill Kenwright offered around \u00a31m to help ease the crisis at Bury but was told football\u2019s rules do not allow financial assistance from a club director to another club", "authors": ["David Conn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0975018d612b25e137ef4a2ea4aa84130f3f45/43_396_3785_2271/master/3785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d33ffc191fc8fc0f3ddd078247ecf0b", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
