The game, however, was tightly poised yet falling in favour of the legends hailing from Merseyside.\n\nAll eyes were on Steven Gerrard as Liverpool Legends were hosted by Rangers at Ibrox\n\nA huge roar went up late on, as Gerrard returned as a Rangers player with 10 minutes to play\n\nThe 39-year-old was playing against his beloved Liverpool on the pitch for the first time ever\n\nGerrard couldn't help but smile as the strange feeling of playing against Liverpool hit home\n\nRolling back the years, Gerrard busied himself spraying passes across the field for both sides\n\nGerrard later shared a touching moment with his young son Lio at the full-time whistle at Ibrox\n\n\ud83d\udc4f The Gaffer, Steven Gerrard comes on for Rangers. pic.twitter.com/KtJ00TebJ6 \u2014 Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) October 12, 2019\n\nFive minutes in and Gary Neville - watching from afar - was perhaps rubbing his hands, savouring the opportunity to pin up colleague Jamie Carragher in the Sky Sports studio and grill him on why a penalty was given away in the opening moments.\n\nCarragher, ever the competitor, shook his head in dismay as the man he had hacked down, Kris Boyd, stepped up 12 yards out.\n\nThe former Gers talisman knew the drill so well. Ball on the spot, brief run up, ball in the back of the net. However, not on this occasion. Whether ring-rust or nerves, Boyd stepped up and slotted the ball completely the wrong side of the left post, offering a sheepish grin thereafter.\n\nAs the crowd picked up in spirits, it was the visitors who would break the deadlock just moments later.\n\nSwift link-up on the right saw a deeper-lying Jermaine Pennant slide a pass down the line to Dirk Kuyt whose engines, as ever, were burning.\n\nLuis Garcia opened the scoring and celebrated with Reds fans' favourite Emile Heskey\n\nHeskey himself rolled back the years and pulled off a sublime lob to further Liverpool's lead\n\nFans packed into the famous stadium and made clear who they were primarily there to see\n\nJamie Carragher soon recovered after giving away a spot-kick in the opening moments\n\nKris Boyd made up for an earlier penalty miss by slotting the ball underneath Jerzey Dudek\n\nSasa Papic and Peter Lovenkrands also linked up to restore some balance for the home side\n\nGerrard went close to scoring for the Reds in the first half, but shot narrowly past the post\n\nThe Dutchman whipped a low cross to the back post, for diminutive Spaniard Luis Garcia to finish off with aplomb courtesy of a precision diving header.\n\nIf Gerrard needed to prove to anybody in Glasgow he still has it, the evidence was soon to arrive. Seats began to flap shut as fans took to their feet, watching Gerrard drive from central midfield on the counter attack with nimble footwork.\n\nDrawing in defenders, the current Rangers boss slotted in Garcia on the right, whose immediate cut-back caught many off guard. Eyes darted across the area as the ball dropped to the feet of Patrick Burger, whose open side-foot had already begun crafting the ball into the bottom corner to double the margin.\n\nBoyd's redemption however would arrive, courtesy of an arcing Lee McCulloch pass with the outside of the foot. Played through one-on-one with Jerzy Dudek, the big striker was in no mood to make another mistake.\n\nPrising open the floodgate, the goals began to pour. Nostalgia tinged the Glaswegian air as Gerrard flicked on the afterburners to drive upfield, before off-loading a disguised pass to fans' favourite Emile Heskey.\n\nRolling back the years, the powerful forward executed an effortless chip, rendering goalkeeper Neil Alexander redundant before peeling away with the iconic 'DJ celebration,' much to Ibrox's delight.\n\nGerrard led out both teams at Ibrox and looked very much at home again in Liverpool red\n\nThe legends of both sides piled together for a group photograph prior to the action\n\nPin-ball football is always likely to ring in goals, and moments later Rangers' smattering possession around the opposition box yielded results. Sasa Papic lofted a deep ball to the willing forehead of Boyd.\n\nA cushioned pass across to Peter Lovenkrands and the ball was soon rifled, with a right-footed volley, safely into the net from close range.\n\nAs the fixture ebbed out its final moments, cries for Gerrard to strike a trademark screamer grew louder. The skipper had changed from red to blue as the switching of allegiances was portrayed.\n\nWhether fate, or the cheek of tough-tackling Alex Rae, a final opportunity was pinched from the toe of the main man, with Gerrard denied the chance to score against his former employers at the death and level the scoreline.\n\nSuch feats, perhaps, are better left unrecorded.\n\nAll proceeds raised in the tie went towards the Rangers Charity foundation and the LFC Foundation.", "description": "On 81 minutes at Ibrox a scene unfolded - never before seen in football history.
