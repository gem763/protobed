That pattern has been remarkably stable for more than a century, even as immigration laws have shifted and as the countries most likely to send immigrants to the United States have changed.\n\nThe adult children of poor Mexican and Dominican immigrants in the country legally today achieve about the same relative economic success as children of poor immigrants from Finland or Scotland did a century ago. All of them, in their respective eras, have fared better than the children of poor native-born Americans. If the American dream is to give the next generation a better life, it appears that poor immigrants have more reliably achieved that dream than native-born Americans have.\n\nThe findings, published in a working paper by a team of economic historians at Princeton, Stanford and the University of California, Davis, challenge several arguments central to the debate over immigration in America today. The Trump administration has moved to reorient the country\u2019s legal immigration toward wealthier immigrants and away from poorer ones, arguing that the nation can\u2019t afford to welcome families who will burden public programs like Medicaid. This research suggests that immigrants who arrive in poverty often escape it, if not in the first generation, then the second.\n\n\u201cThe short-term perspective on immigrant assimilation that politicians tend to take might underestimate the long-run success of immigrants,\u201d said Ran Abramitzky, a professor at Stanford and one of the paper\u2019s authors, along with Leah Platt Boustan, Elisa J\u00e1come and Santiago P\u00e9rez. \u201cBy the second generation, they are doing quite well.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and other proponents of tighter immigration have also suggested that today\u2019s immigrants, predominantly from Latin America and Asia, are less likely to assimilate into the economy than earlier immigrant waves from Europe. This data suggests that is not true. It also shows that Norwegians, whom Trump has held up as model immigrants, were in fact among the least successful after they arrived.\n\nThe researchers looked at the adult outcomes of sons who grew up in families at about the 25th percentile of the income distribution in the United States. The father-son pairs are seen in a first wave in the 1880 census, at a time when most immigrants were from Northern and Western Europe, or in a second wave in the 1910 census, when more immigrants came from Southern and Eastern Europe. The researchers then followed the families over several decades in census records to see whether the sons had surpassed their fathers \u2014 by, for instance, becoming lawyers instead of shop clerks.\n\nThe census did not begin to ask about income until 1940, and so the researchers estimated an income score for each father and son before 1940 using detailed occupations reported in the census as well as other demographic information. (Women are harder to track from one census to the next because they often change their names in marriage.)\n\nThe findings suggest that sons of immigrants from nearly every country that sent large numbers to the United States had higher intergenerational mobility than sons of native-born fathers. And that picture remains true today, even as immigration patterns have shifted around the world.\n\nData on this most recent wave of immigrants comes from a large database linking federal tax data and other government records for millions of children born between 1978 and 1983 and their parents. That data, constructed by researchers at Opportunity Insights, has separately been used to study patterns in intergenerational mobility by race and region in the United States.\n\nThat more recent data includes only immigrants with Social Security numbers, and so immigrants in the country illegally are missing from this picture (the distinction between legal and illegal immigration was largely irrelevant during earlier waves of unlimited European immigration). The researchers cannot say if the children of immigrants in the country illegally would fit this pattern today, but in the study\u2019s other evidence there are reasons to suspect they might.", "description": "Immigration to the United States has consistently offered a route to escape poverty -- if not for poor immigrants themselves, then for their sons.New research linking millions of fathers and sons dating to the 1880s shows that children of poor immigrants in America have had greater success climbing the", "authors": ["Emily Badger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RlCAmc67lNGza7DWSp1Y6A--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/55aff5f0-f9b6-11e9-aa6f-333cedbc4205", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
