I knew Moussa would be ready.\u2019\n\nPressed on whether he would play for France against Turkey on Monday, he added: \u2018I do not think it\u2019s too serious for NG [Kante], but I do not have an answer tonight.\u2019\n\nFrance struggled somewhat in the absence of Kante \u2013 as well as the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba \u2013 but won 1-0 thanks to an Olivier Giroud penalty.\n\nKante\u2019s setback will do nothing for relations between Deschamps and Lampard, with the Chelsea boss having been wary of letting Kante join up with the national team so soon after coming back from injury.\n\nDeschamps watched his side secure a narrow win in Iceland on Friday (Picture: Getty)\n\nSpeaking after naming Kante in the squad in spite of Lampard\u2019s request, Deschamps said: \u2018Lampard asked me not to pick Kante at the last rally, if it\u2019s still that way.\n\n\u2018Maybe I\u2019ll call him later to tell him it would be nice if you play Olivier Giroud a little bit.\u2019", "description": "France coach Didier Deschamps has played down the severity of N\u2019Golo Kante\u2019s injury after the midfielder picked up a problem in the warm-up prior to Friday night\u2019s game.
