Co-written by Harry, Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon, both of whom also produced the track, \u201cLights Up\u201d is a fairly short song by comparison to \u201cSign of the Times\u201d, sitting at just under three minutes.\n\nStill, good things come in small packages, and \u201cLights Up\u201d is definitely a good thing. Leaning more pop than his self-titled debut album, the track is all wonky guitars and small psychedelic vocal flourishes. Forgoing traditional song structures, \u201cLights Up\u201d is instead built up of a number hooky pre-and-post-choruses and one central chorus that they all dance around. Thanks to some initially understated percussion, this meandering structure doesn\u2019t get tired, but rather reaches a rather splendid crescendo, before dropping out for the track\u2019s outro.\n\nWhile the song itself sounds like nights spent getting it on as the sunsets while lounging on a beach cabana, the music video, which was shot in Mexico and directed by Vincent Haycock, pretty much shows us that. Harry, who now apparently only appears in photo or video shoots with no shirt on, appears literally dripping with sweat as a bunch of hot men and women rub themselves all up against him. It\u2019s enough to make you want to take a cold shower.\n\nThe video also sees Harry riding a motorcycle while sitting backwards (still shirtless), as well as donning a custom two-piece bespoke silk moire suit, designed by Harris Reed, and a shiny suit that he goes paddling in the sea in. Much like those pictures of Harry cuddling piglets, lambs and baby goats, the video is A Lot.\n\nAlong with the video, Harry and his team have also created a website where you can create custom compliments, which fits in with his whole \u201ctreat people with kindness\u201d mantra rather nicely. What a nice chap.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "The song is called \u2018Lights Up\u2019 and is *chef\u2019s kiss*", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da057c26b1388000aac9dda/lede/1570789937461-watch-harry-styles-music-video-lights-up.jpeg?crop=0.9351111111111111xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
