President trump and that growing firestorm over a call with a foreign leader. The conversation in question believed to be with Ukraine's new president and whher trump brought up his potential 2020 challenger Joe Biden. The president downplaying that phone call and Biden also responding now. ABC's David Wright is live at the white house with more. David, good morning. Reporter: Good morning, whit. The white house is pushing back on those reports that the president pressured a foreign government to dig up dirt on a political rival. President trump calls that a political hack job, that story. But as new details emerge, there are some big questions. In the oval office with the Australian prime minister, president trump insisted there was nothing amiss about a July phone call he had with another world leader, the newly elected president of Ukraine. It was a totally appropriate conversation. It was actually a beautiful conversation. Reporter: But \"The wall Street journal\" reports that on that call, trump repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden's son, hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company when his father was vice president.

The president should start to be present. Reporter: Biden is calling on trump to release the transcript of that call. House speaker Nancy Pelosi says that by refusing to release the whistle-blower complaint, the administration is entering what she called a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions. But for now the director of national intelligence and the justice department are refusing to do so. David, a lot of reaction to this. It's already having an impact over the debate, over the impeachment investigation. Over the impeachment investigation. Reporter: That's right. Overnight senator Elizabeth Warren among others called on members of congress to as she put it do your constitutional duty and impeach the president. A lot of disagreement in congress over whether or not to proceed with an impeachment proceeding and bottom line, though, the Democrats simply don't have the votes to remove the president, whit. All right, David Wright at the white house for us, thank\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Joe Biden is calling on the president to release the transcript of the phone call in question.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190921_gma_wright_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
