That could involve Smollett turning himself in to a Chicago police station.\n\nHe said he did not have a time frame for how long the actor would be given.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to be diplomatic and reasonable, and we\u2019re hoping he does the same,\u201d Guglielmi said.\n\nThe charges emerged on the same day that detectives and two brothers who were earlier deemed suspects testified before a grand jury. Smollett\u2019s attorneys met with prosecutors and police, but it was unknown what they discussed or whether Smollett attended the meeting. The attorneys did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe announcement of the charges followed a flurry of activity in recent days, including lengthy interviews of the brothers by authorities, a search of their home and their release after police cleared them.\n\nInvestigators have not said what the brothers told detectives or what evidence detectives collected. But it became increasingly clear that serious questions had arisen about Smollett\u2019s account - something police signaled Friday when they announced a \u201csignificant shift in the trajectory\u201d of the probe after the brothers were freed.\n\nSmollett, who is black and gay and plays a gay character on the hit Fox television show, said he was attacked as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop. He said the masked men beat him, made derogatory comments and yelled \u201cThis is MAGA country\u201d - an apparent reference to President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d - before fleeing.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television issued a statement saying Smollett \u201ccontinues to be a consummate professional on set\u201d and that his character is not being written off the show. The series is shot in Chicago and follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the record industry.\n\nThe studio\u2019s statement followed reports that Smollett\u2019s role was being slashed amid the police investigation.\n\nWhispers about Smollett\u2019s potential role in the attack started with reports that he had not fully cooperated with police and word that detectives in a city bristling with surveillance cameras could not find video of the attack.\n\nDetectives did find and release images of two people they said they wanted to question and last week picked up the brothers at O\u2019Hare Airport as they returned from Nigeria. Police questioned the men and searched their apartment.\n\nThe brothers, who were identified by their attorney as Abimbola \u201cAbel\u201d and Olabinjo \u201cOla\u201d Osundairo, were held for nearly 48 hours on suspicion of assaulting Smollett.\n\nThe day after they were released, police said the men provided information that had \u201cshifted the trajectory of the investigation,\u201d and detectives requested another interview with Smollett.\n\nPolice said one of the men had appeared on \u201cEmpire,\u201d and Smollett\u2019s attorneys said one of the men is the actor\u2019s personal trainer, whom he hired to help get him physically ready for a music video. The actor released his debut album, \u201cSum of My Music,\u201d last year.\n\nSmollett was charged by prosecutors, not the grand jury. The police spokesman said the brothers appeared before the panel to \u201clock in their testimony.\u201d\n\nSpeaking outside the courthouse where the grand jury met, the brothers\u2019 attorney said the two men testified for about two and a half hours.\n\n\u201cThere was a point where this story needed to be told, and they manned up and they said we\u2019re going to correct this,\u201d Gloria Schmidt said.\n\nShe said her clients did not care about a plea deal or immunity. \u201cYou don\u2019t need immunity when you have the truth,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said her clients received money from Smollett, but she did not elaborate.\n\nSmollett has been active in LBGTQ issues, and initial reports of the assault drew outrage and support for him on social media, including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and TV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nFormer Cook County prosecutor Andrew Weisberg said judges rarely throw defendants in prison for making false reports, opting instead to place them on probation, particularly if they have no prior criminal record.\n\nSmollett has a record - one that concerns giving false information to police when he was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. According to records, he was also charged with false impersonation and driving without a license. He later pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and took an alcohol education and treatment program.\n\nAnother prospective problem is the bill someone might receive after falsely reporting a crime that prompted a nearly monthlong investigation, including the collection and review of hundreds of hours of surveillance video.\n\nThe size of the tab is anyone\u2019s guess, but given how much time the police have invested, the cost could be huge.\n\nWeisberg recently represented a client who was charged with making a false report after surveillance video discredited her account of being robbed by three men at O\u2019Hare Airport.\n\nFor an investigation that took only a single day, his client had to split restitution of $8,400, Weisberg said. In Smollett\u2019s case, \u201cI can imagine that this would be easily into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nAlso Wednesday, Chicago\u2019s top prosecutor, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, announced that she had recused herself from the investigation.\n\nHer office explained that Foxx made the decision \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d because of conversations she had with one of Smollett\u2019s family members just after the report. When the relative expressed concerns about the case, Foxx \u201cfacilitated a connection\u201d between the family member and detectives, according to a statement.\n\nFoxx said the case would be handled to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 28-year veteran prosecutor.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett was charged Wednesday with making a false police report when he said he was attacked in downtown Chicago by two men who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs and looped a rope around his neck, police said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Don Babwin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/02/20/Empire_Cast_Member-Attack_90847.jpg-a3e4e_c0-563-2263-1882_s1770x1032.jpg?a8ed1ba936223ba72708379c28ec698cc745059d"}
