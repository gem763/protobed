The main goal would be to prevent the Islamic State from re-establishing all or parts of its religious state, or caliphate, in Syria and neighboring Iraq.\n\nA side benefit would be helping the Kurds keep control of oil fields in the east, the official said.\n\nMr. Trump seemed to hint at this outcome in a message on Twitter on Sunday, saying, \u201cWe have secured the Oil.\u201d\n\nThe senior administration official suggested that the president was balancing competing impulses: achieving the ultimate goal of bringing United State forces home from Syria \u2014 part of a signature campaign promise to pull American troops from \u201cendless wars\u201d \u2014 and ensuring that efforts to contain and diminish ISIS continue. The order also could be heard as at least a partial answer to those who have criticized the president\u2019s policy.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Middleeast Trump-Troops-Syria-Turkey.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
