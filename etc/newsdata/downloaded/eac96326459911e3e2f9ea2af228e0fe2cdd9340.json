Lewandowski is a rare example of someone who is left, and I don't see many players that can easily fit up front.\n\n\"There is a need for somebody up front who is strong enough to hold the ball and to give time and space to the players like Paul Pogba and McTominay to create something in midfield to put passes together.\n\n\"You're asking a lot from young players because passing the ball around and having nice touches, it just looks too nice and it doesn't work.\"\n\nSo far this season Marcus Rashford is United's top scorer with four goals, with Daniel James just behind him on three.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nMbappe, meanwhile, has scored two goals in five Ligue 1 matches for PSG, as well as bagging a hat-trick in the Champions League during the French team's 5-1 victory over Club Bruges on Tuesday.\n\nPSG would no doubt demand a huge transfer fee in order for Mbappe to depart the club, with the World Cup winner's contract running until 2022.", "description": "One ex-United player believes Mbappe could be the answer to their problems going forward", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19784875.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FBL-FRA-LIGUE1-PSG-TOULOUSE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
