While Biden was handling international relations with Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration, Hunter was being paid $50,000 a month by Ukrainian gas company Bursima despite having no natural energy experience.\n\nPresident Donald Trump brought up the issue to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call in July. Democrats repeatedly said Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless an investigation was launched. Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump the night before the unclassified, unredacted version of the transcript was released, based solely off a whistleblower complaint. The person who filed the complaint had second-hand knowledge of the phone call. The transcript showed no quid pro quo.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Hunter has remained silent until now.", "description": "Whoa..10/13/2019 14:26:14PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/277/dfaba410-115a-4b40-8fe0-1d50c845e967.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
