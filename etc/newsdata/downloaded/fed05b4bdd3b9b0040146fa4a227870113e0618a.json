More than 2 million people could lose power.\n\n\u201cThe next 72 hours is going to be challenging,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters Saturday. \u201cI can sugarcoat it, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nOfficials ordered the towns of Healdsburg and Windsor evacuated. At 6 p.m., the order was extended to a wide swath of the Sonoma County coast. The new map shows that other communities under mandatory evacuation include Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport, Guerneville and Bodega Bay, with zones of mandatory evacuation stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvacuation warnings were issued to communities in northern Santa Rosa, including the Coffey Park neighborhood that burned in 2017\u2019s Tubbs fire; Sebastopol and surrounding areas; and mountains along the border with Napa County.\n\nOfficials emphasized that it was important for the evacuation to be complete before preventive power outages took effect.\n\nBy Saturday night, winds are expected to pick up considerably.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw gusts between 80 and 85 mph,\u201d National Weather Service meteorologist Drew Peterson said. \u201cHopefully, [firefighters] can make some progress. We\u2019ll most likely see the fire spreading once again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection warned residents to heed the evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the past three years, all of the large and damaging fires have occurred at this time of the year during an offshore wind event, particularly during red-flag warnings,\u201d said Jonathan Cox, a spokesman for Cal Fire. \u201cIt has us highly concerned that the vulnerable areas of California could see some explosive fires.\u201d\n\nOfficials had already expanded evacuation zones to include Gifford Springs, Whispering Pines, Anderson Springs, Adams Springs, Hobergs and Cobb Mountain.\n\nAuthorities said a firefighter and two civilians were injured when they were overwhelmed by flames as the firefighter was attempting to evacuate the pair.\n\n\u201cThe firefighter was forced to deploy his fire shelter, where he shielded them from fire,\u201d Cal Fire said in a statement. After the flames passed, all three were taken to a hospital. None of them suffered life-threatening injuries, the statement said.\n\nAs of Saturday night, 23,500 structures were threatened. The fire was 11% contained.\n\nResidents of Healdsburg and Windsor and surrounding areas were urged to stay with friends or family outside the evacuation zone. Others were encouraged to head down Highway 101 to Petaluma, where shelters were opening at the veterans hall and the fairgrounds. Livestock could be sheltered at the Santa Rosa fairgrounds, officials said.\n\nDominic Foppoli, mayor of Windsor, urged residents to move quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo not take this warning lightly, we need everybody to evacuate\u2026. This is a life-threatening situation and a danger to our entire town,\u201d he said.\n\nFire officials said the evacuation orders could be the largest in the region\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe understand the impact of the evacuations we are about to announce are going to be substantial,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe are really prioritizing safety for what is potentially the worst case scenario.\u201d\n\nBy noon in Windsor, traffic was moving slowly south on the 101, a main evacuation route. Lines of cars snaked around a gas station in the town of 28,000.\n\nPaige Sweet, 22, said she quickly packed up her clothes, keepsakes and two German shepherds after hearing the evacuation orders.\n\nStanding in her driveway, Sweet said she never expected to be forced to leave.\n\n\u201cI took things just in case we lose our home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely nerve-racking if it does come this way. I don\u2019t even know what would happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Weather Service said sustained winds from the northeast of 40 mph were expected to push the blaze toward Highway 101. Peak winds, with gusts between 60 mph and 80 mph, were forecast from midnight until sunrise.\n\nCal Fire said there was high potential for trees and branches to fall across power lines and roads, and for embers to spark new fires.\n\nBy 3:30 p.m., Healdsburg was empty. Almost all of its 11,000 residents had heeded the mandatory evacuation that began at 10 a.m., piling into cars that now turned the 101 south toward San Francisco into a bottleneck of traffic.\n\nCity Councilman Shaun McCaffery said he was in a hardware store when the word came down that everyone had to go. He had expected the news, but when dozens of cellphones beeped with urgent alerts at the same time, people were alarmed, he said.\n\nWith memories of the devastating Tubbs fire just two years ago, most were willing to leave.\n\n\u201cThere was consternation earlier today. You are going to get some grumblers,\u201c said Rhea Borja, spokeswoman for the city of Healdsburg.\n\nBut Borja said the city has been working for some time to prepare people for the possibility of a massive departure. Just last weekend, it held a practice drill to get people ready.\n\nKevin Burke, chief of the Healdsburg Police Department, said his officers had been going door to door all day to confirm that most people were gone. With power scheduled to be cut off within an hour, Burke and his team were patrolling for stragglers.\n\nBut not everyone was willing to go.\n\nMcCaffery said he was staying. He had been in the hardware store buying sprinklers for his roof, and a 400-pound generator sat in the back of his truck. His family was safe in a hotel in Sebastopol, where the kids were probably in the pool, he said, but he was staying behind in hopes of protecting his home and the family\u2019s three cats \u2014 Butter, Percy, and Inka \u2014 in case the worst happens and the winds bring embers into the wine country town.\n\nOn a side street not far from the town center in Healdsburg, Tom, a resident who declined to give his last name, was in his garage with his son-in-law Kevin drilling holes in particleboard.\n\n\u201cMy theory, and I think it\u2019s pretty well proven: I believe all the homes lost in the Tubbs fire were from attic vents,\u201d he said.\n\nA civil engineer, Tom said that he believed sparks flying in the vents had burned the homes from inside. The duo planned on sealing the 35 vents in his home, which is surrounded by a thick shading of trees. Then they would leave town.\n\n\u201cIf the police don\u2019t kick me out first,\u201c Tom said.\n\nA few doors down, Brian White was charging some electric lanterns and listening to the scanner. He said he did not intend to leave his house, which has the double fire buffer of a cemetery behind it and a golf course nearby.\n\nBut he sent his two kids and his wife across town to stay with his parents, where they would be easily able to get out of town if need be, and his Suzuki 650 motorcycle was ready in the garage if all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cIt would take a hellacious windstorm\u201d to bring the fire into town, and he didn\u2019t think it would happen, White said. He was more worried about leaving his home unattended in the vacant city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a house thing, it\u2019s an ownership thing,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther out of town, near the Geyser Peak Winery, Anna Levinger and her crew of farmhands were busy cutting low branches away from anything that could burn and prepping her riding school in case the fire came close. She has 35 horses and a menagerie of other animals including llamas, pigs and goats. She had a \u201cmilitary style\u201c evacuation plan ready on a spreadsheet.\n\n\u201cEverything I own loads, even my bull,\u201c she said.\n\nStill, Levinger was not yet planning to leave \u201cbecause the fire would have to get through miles of vineyards\u201d to reach her. \u201cThere are embers and spot fires, but that is not the same as a firestorm, which is what they are selling,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201c\n\nNew mandatory evacuation zones announced Saturday night run right up to the northern edge of Santa Rosa\u2019s city limits, close to the city\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood, where 1,500 homes were destroyed in the Tubbs fire in 2017.\n\nSections of northern Santa Rosa were under evacuation warning, including the private Fountaingrove Club, which is home to a golf course and athletic facilities, as well as neighborhoods along Fountaingrove Parkway and Parker Hill Road.\n\nStephen Volmer, a Cal fire analyst, said the new evacuations were caused when the fire shot out into an area on its eastern flank. Volmer said that area could blow embers into the nearby Alexander Valley.\n\nIf the valley caught fire, sparks could then reach Healdsburg, potentially blowing up to a mile at a time all the way to the Pacific.\n\nThe evacuation orders also include the Sonoma County Jail, officials said. The facility\u2019s 350 inmates are currently being evacuated to the Santa Rita Jail.\n\nFire officials said the greatest danger will come if the fire jumps the 101 as it did in 2017 in some spots. Volmer said this is a special concern around Healdsburg, where there has not been a significant fire incident since the 1940s, leaving heavy brush in the area.\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said one wireless alert was sent out to the new evacuation zones before power was cut off.\n\nBut county Supervisor Lynda Hopkins said many of the areas being evacuated are subdivisions that \u201cshould never have been built\u201c on steep hillsides with few roads in or out. She said she is especially concerned about Guerneville, where many people do not have cars and there is a large population of senior citizens \u2014 and only two roads in and out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she said.\n\nWeather forecasters said the Diablo winds were expected to begin in earnest about 8 p.m., blowing embers of the Kincade fire perhaps for miles. When the 4 p.m. bells rang at the local church, there was a little more than a breeze rustling the oaks and evergreens in the town square.\n\nThe Kincade fire began Wednesday night and has swept through an area where memories of the Tubbs fire that burned entire neighborhoods to the ground two years ago are still vivid. That 2017 fire scorched more than 36,000 acres and claimed 22 lives.\n\nThis time around, the community has had more time to prepare, said Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore.\n\n\u201cWe are in a position where we are reliving something, but we\u2019re ahead of it,\u201d Gore said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to test to our resolve. Everybody in our community needs to get the heck out of the way of the first responders so they can do their job.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the governor traveled to a mobile home park in American Canyon and spoke with residents who said they were warned about the power outage just a few hours before PG&E planned to cut the lights.\n\nLucille Constantine, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, told the governor that she tried to pick up extra medication from a nearby pharmacy before the store lost power. But her health insurance under Medicare wouldn\u2019t pay for the additional treatments until her existing supply ran out, she said.\n\nConstantine, 69, said she was told she could pay over $1,000 out of pocket for the medication and seek reimbursement later.\n\n\u201cYou could get it if you have the money,\u201d Constantine said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t afford that right now. It\u2019s a month\u2019s rent.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of Las Casitas mobile home park, Tom Mogg, showed Newsom a generator he purchased for $800 over the summer.\n\nMogg, 93, said that he can\u2019t afford for the food in his two refrigerators and freezer to spoil during an outage and that his partner, Lillian Crimmins, needs the generator to power a machine that helps her breathe at night.\n\n\u201cWe figured if I have trouble, we\u2019ve got a way to get it plugged in with the generator,\u201d said Crimmins, 87.\n\nMogg blasted PG&E.\n\n\u201cFor too many years, instead of fixing the infrastructure, hardening the lines and doing all the things they should have been doing to make this a first-class electrical system, they\u2019ve been pouring it into executive salaries, stockholders,\u201d Mogg said. \u201cThey are not pouring it into the areas that are going to affect them delivering energy to us.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the governor said the state had secured $75 million for areas affected by power shut-offs, including in Southern California, where the Tick fire has been burning. Half would be allocated to local governments, with the cities of Los Angeles, San Jose, San Diego and Oakland receiving $500,000 each. The money could be used to purchase equipment to mitigate the effects of shut-offs, such as generators, fuel storage and other backup energy sources.\n\nThis week, the state provided additional resources to assist PG&E in inspecting power lines and turning the power back on more quickly, including for aircraft and infrared technology, Newsom said.", "description": "Sonoma County braces for historically powerful winds and widespread power outages as the Kincade fire rages on, forcing more than 90,000 to evacuate.", "authors": ["Taryn Luna Covers Gov.
