He also claimed Trump would not profit from the decision to hold the global conference at his own commercial property.\n\nIn their letter \u2015 addressed to Mulvaney, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan (who submitted his resignation last week), Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2015 the senators demanded to know when Trump first suggested the summit be held at his Miami resort. He first made the suggestion publicly in late August.\n\nThe senators are demanding to see a wide swath of documentation, including texts, emails and meeting notes, a list of precisely which other sites were considered and those properties\u2019 bids, and projected costs of hosting the summit at Doral.\n\nMultiple past White House ethics chiefs \u2015 along with Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano \u2015 have slammed the decision as a clear violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses.", "description": "Sens.
