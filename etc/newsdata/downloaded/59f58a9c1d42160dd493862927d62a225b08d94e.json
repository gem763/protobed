Peter Braig\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the mum and dad shareholders who own it, it\u2019s the customers, it\u2019s the suppliers and contractors, the communities that people operate in, and many times people feel strongly about companies taking a stand,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get the balance right.\u201d\n\nBusiness leaders \u201cshould not be torn\u201d between shareholders or the community because \u201cthe two are not in conflict\u201d, Westacott says.\n\n\u201cCompanies represent their shareholders because they have taken the risk,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to create value for shareholders in the long term, you\u2019ve got to look after your employees, customers and suppliers.\u201d\n\nPoliticians and the public are right to question whether \u201ccompanies are lecturing\u201d, but in most cases, she says, they are \u201cdoing what they say\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are CEOs to change the rules\n\nA similar point was made at The Australian Financial Review Property Summit in September, where Dexus CEO Darren Steinberg said that while climate change was a top priority for the property industry, it did not delve into other social issues that might offend some customers.\n\nJLL Australia CEO Stephen Conroy agreed that \u201cCEOs should be careful because they\u2019ll be seen by their staff to be bullying them into a personal view\u201d.\n\nBut Mirvac CEO Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz said property companies played a huge role in creating the spaces where people live and work. \u201cThe impact we have on people\u2019s lives is enormous, and that\u2019s a social responsibility we have,\u201d she says.\n\nThe debate has been bubbling along for years but has gained momentum as top companies have moved to update their purpose to focus on broader community concerns, rather than solely on shareholders.\n\nSusan Lloyd-Hurwitz says property companies have a social responsibility. Peter Braig\n\nThe issue came to a head after Morton, seemingly with the imprimatur of the Prime Minister, said corporate Australia would do well to focus on profits, shareholders and their customers over social activism.\n\nOn a recent panel, property veteran Bruce Harper suggested that jumping on the social bandwagon can result in disingenuity. \u201cAGL campaigns with the bearded work guy standing in front of windmills ... effectively saying we\u2019re going to be out of coal,\u201d Harper says. \u201cYet you look at their business plan and they\u2019re going to rely for 80 per cent of their revenue for the next 20 or 30 years on fossil fuels, so a lot of that stuff becomes unbelievable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness backlash\n\nThere has been a backlash in the US. Columbia Law School Professor Katharina Pistor asks: \u201cWho are CEOs to autonomously change the rules of capitalism? Apparently, America\u2019s corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really isn\u2019t theirs to make.\u201d\n\nQuestions about the merit of companies taking up social causes is an extension of a debate over directors\u2019 duties. By law, directors are required to act in the best interests of the company. Some directors take \u201cthe company\u201d to mean shareholders alone, but others argue the definition is broader and takes in customers and other stakeholders.\n\nFormer NAB chairman Ken Henry and others have suggested that directors\u2019 duties should be changed to explicitly include the need to act in the interests of the whole \u201ccommunity\u201d, rather than just shareholders.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Company Directors started a fresh debate about the law in March, but appeared to back away after members soon made it clear there was no case to change the law.\n\nLindsay Maxsted, chairman of Westpac and roads operator Transurban, insists that shareholder primacy still reigns supreme: \u201cThe customers haven\u2019t appointed me, the community hasn\u2019t appointed me, the shareholders have, so they own the company and have selected a group of people to act.\u201d\n\nProfessor of corporate law at Melbourne University Ian Ramsay says part of the tension arises because the law has not dispelled the principle of shareholder primacy. He points to the 2011 decision of Justice Julie Ward, which maintains the duty to act in the best interests of the company \u201cis generally interpreted to mean the shareholders as a whole ... often referred to as the shareholder primacy norm\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRamsay says he has always understood the duty of directors to provide scope to consider interests other than those of shareholders, but acknowledges the issue is \u201cfiercely contested\u201d, with a broad spectrum of views.\n\nCharter Hall director Greg Paramor acknowledges part of the challenge is that social pursuits can often be hard to measure. \u201cWhen you spend money on particular things, be it water or power, you can measure that,\u201d he says. Socially minded campaigns prompt questions like: \u201cWhy did you spend two hours on that project which was about homeless people when you could have been out signing up a new lease?\u201d\n\nHowever, Paramor says companies also need to be guided by their shareholders, and more of them are asking: \u201cWhat are you doing about the social side of your business?\u201d\n\nHe says taking a stand on social and environmental issues can actually increase productivity. \u201cI think you can interact the social things very much with your commercial outcomes and actually get a better result, because if you\u2019ve got a happy workforce, you\u2019re going to make more money and the shareholders are going to be better off,\u201d he says.\n\nRamsay believes it would be a \u201cdisservice to public debate\u201d to deny business leaders a voice. But he acknowledges that under the intense scrutiny of Canberra and tension within the business community, corporate leaders will need to be more diligent in making out a business case to back up their views.", "description": "Corporate Australia remains torn between its duty to shareholders and speaking up on environmental and social issues.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_292%2C$y_197/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2934e34e8e7530f0b201c106cd0b564195b8755f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
