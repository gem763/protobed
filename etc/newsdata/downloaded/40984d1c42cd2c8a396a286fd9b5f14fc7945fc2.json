He now is working very strongly as a member of the Labor team, and that\u2019s a good thing and I welcome his contribution.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got an important role to hold the government to account on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and on issues like robo-debt, and he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nMr Shorten said he planned to stay in politics for another 20 years and wanted to make a contribution to the rebuilding of Labor before the next election, due in 2022.\n\nWe are reassessing our policies, but not our values, which are eternal. \u2014 Anthony Albanese, Labor Party leader\n\nMr Albanese said the review headed by former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill and former federal minister Craig Emerson would draw a \"line in the sand\" for the opposition, ahead of a series of vision statements before the May federal budget, the first on jobs and the future of work.\n\n\"That will outline how Labor intends to move forward. We are reassessing our policies, but not our values, which are eternal.\n\n\"There'll be another one on the economy; the jobs in the future of work one will be delivered in Perth, in Western Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There'll be other major statements on the range of policies going forward, between now and the May budget, and then we'll set about 2020 \u2013 adopting a range of policies, specific policies, that are costed going forward.\n\n\"We need to recognise that the election campaign is not won this year [but rather] in 2022. We need to be considered about how we move forward; make sure that we have the right policies that will see us be successful, because Australia needs a Labor government.\"\n\nMr Albanese's choice of Perth for what will be the first major speech of his leadership articulating policy direction is significant given Labor failed to make headway in the mining-dependent state despite a struggling economy.\n\nMr Albanese said the Coalition was treading water and only had a plan to stay in power.\n\n\"You can't run a government by just being opposed to the Labor Party, and they are acting more and more like an opposition-in-exile sitting on the government benches.\"\n\nIn an interview published on Sunday, Mr Shorten responded \"no\" when asked if he wanted the top job again.\n\n\"I've hung up my leadership running shoes and I support Anthony [Albanese],\" he said.\n\nHe said he accepted the shock election result, as he would have \"owned it\" if he'd won.", "description": "The Opposition Leader says he accepts Bill Shorten's word that his predecessor no longer aspires to be prime minister.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2226%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_51/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5ad2798465a170b9e03d342e5ece23abb5805aec", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
