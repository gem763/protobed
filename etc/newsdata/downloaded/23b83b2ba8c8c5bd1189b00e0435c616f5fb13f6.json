Kamala Harris on Wednesday released her plan for addressing climate change, calling for $10 trillion in public and private funding to create a carbon-neutral economy and invoking her past as a prosecutor to target companies that are driving greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cAs president, I will hold polluters accountable for the damage they inflict upon our environment and set us on a path to a 100 percent clean economy that creates millions of good-paying jobs,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cThis crisis demands urgency and boldness, and as president, I will act.\u201d\n\nHarris' plan also leans on environmental justice principles, which aim to reverse the inequities that have seen poor and minority populations that bear the brunt of environmental pollution. Her proposal lands the same day as a CNN town hall where ten leading Democratic contenders, including Harris, will describe their plans for combating the problem.\n\nWhat would the plan do?\n\n\n\nIt calls for promoting environmental justice for communities through massive investments in areas like drinking water infrastructure and ensuring that climate rules benefit low-income communities.\n\nIt also seeks to end subsidies for the fossil fuel industry; boost federal government enforcement to ensure companies are complying with regulations; require companies to \u201cappropriately assess and disclose risks from climate change;\u201d and implement a \u201cprogressively increasing fee\u201d on carbon pollution.\n\nThe plan would seek to create a clean energy economy by 2045. That involves requiring all new buses, heavy-duty vehicles and vehicle fleets to be zero-emission by 2030 and all vehicles to be 100 percent zero-emission by 2035. And it would require all new buildings to be carbon-neutral by 2030 and having a carbon neutral electric grid by 2030.\n\nHarris would drastically alter the use of public lands, and her plan calls for \u201cimmediately halting all new fossil fuel leases on federal lands and waters\u201d and aggressively protecting and restoring public lands so they are public net carbon sinks by 2030. She would also use existing authorities, such as the Antiquities Act, to protect 30 percent of the nation\u2019s lands and oceans by 2030.\n\nAnd the plan would amplify international climate leadership by rejoining the Paris climate accord and issuing a new ambitious emissions reduction pledge and strategy.\n\nHow much would it cost?\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign says the plan would provide \u201c$10 trillion in public and private funding\u201d over the next decade to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. But it does not say what portion of spending would come from public sources, nor does it offer a breakdown of its spending like some of her Democratic rivals' plans do.\n\nHowever, one clear spending priority is $250 billion over five years for upgrading drinking water infrastructure.\n\nHow would it work?\n\n\n\nMany of Harris\u2019 proposals would require Congress to pass new legislation and funding allocations. But the California Democrat says she\u2019ll use executive authority wherever possible to begin implementing her plan on day one of her presidency. Among other priorities, Harris vows to \u201cend federal support for the fossil fuel industry\u201d through executive action where possible and says she\u2019ll oppose new fossil fuel infrastructure projects.\n\nSome of her plans, like reengaging on international climate negotiations and incorporating environmental justice principles into federal decision-making, could be accomplished through executive action.\n\nWho would it help?\n\n\n\nHarris says her proposal \u201clifts up the communities across our country that have been ignored for too long\u201d and would create \u201cmillions of family-sustaining jobs.\u201d The plan also seeks to incorporate into policy discussions the low-income, minority and indigenous communities that Harris said are too often excluded from the process.\n\nWhat have other candidates proposed?\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris is among the candidates, including Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar and former Obama administration official Juli\u00e1n Castro, to release their plans in recent days.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has called for $1.7 trillion of federal money into clean energy spending over the next decade, while Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed $16.3 trillion over a decade to combat the problem. Most other leading contenders have floated their own plans \u2014Beto O\u2019Rourke offered $5 trillion in spending over the next decade, a sum slightly more than what Andrew Yang proposed.\n\nWho opposes it?\n\nThe fossil fuel industry, which Harris\u2019 plan says \u201cmust be held to account for knowingly damaging our environment and endangering public health,\u201d is sure to staunchly oppose many of the core components of the proposal. Republicans in Congress have shown little appetite for carbon fees or the direct spending called for in Harris\u2019 plan.\n\n", "description": "Her proposal lands the same day as a CNN town hall where ten leading Democratic contenders will describe their plans for combating the problem.", "authors": ["Anthony Adragna"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
