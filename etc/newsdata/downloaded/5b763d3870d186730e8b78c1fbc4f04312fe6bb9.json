It was announced in November 2017 that climbing Uluru, considered a sacred site by the local Anangu people, would be banned from October 26, 2019. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park's board of management, made up of a majority of Aboriginal traditional owners, unanimously decided to close the climb. Traditional owner and board chairman Sammy Wilson said on behalf of the Anangu people it was time to do so. 'We've talked about it for so long and now we're able to close the climb,' Mr Wilson said. 'It's about protection through combining two systems, the government and Anangu. 'This decision is for both Anangu and non-Anangu together to feel proud about; to realise, of course it's the right thing to close it. 'The land has law and culture. We welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let's come together, let's close it together. 'If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. It is the same here for Anangu. We welcome tourists here. We are not stopping tourism, just this activity.' On 26 October 1985 Uluru and Kata Tjuta - formerly known as the Olgas - were handed back to the Anangu people.\n\nDespite the pressure, Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch said no plans were in place to close the site.\n\nIn the past a number of calls have been made for numerous landmarks across the country to be closed out of respect for Aboriginal culture and beliefs.\n\nMount Warning, near Murwillumbah in New South Wales, is known to the local indigenous Bundjalung people as Wollumbin and they have asked climbers not to walk up its 1,156m peak.\n\nExplorer James Cook named Mount Warning after encountering dangerous reefs off the coast in 1770.\n\nNow formally carrying the dual names Wollumbin and Mount Warning, it is considered a sacred men's site and not all Aboriginal men are allowed on the summit.\n\nMore than 100,000 walkers make the trek each year, many leaving rubbish such as toilet paper behind.\n\nTweed Shire Council's indigenous heritage officer Rob Appo last year told The Australian those who climbed Mount Warning were 'a little bit disrespectful' to indigenous creation stories.\n\n'We'd prefer people not to climb it, particularly to the summit because that's where a lot of those stories focus on,' Mr Appo said.\n\nThe Bundjalung man said large numbers of people climbing the mountain also caused environmental damage to the area.\n\n'People 'toileting' and leaving rubbish is really a sign of disrespect to that important place,' Mr Appo told The Australian.\n\nMount Warning, near Murwillumbah (pictured), is known to the local indigenous Bundjalung people as Wollumbin and they have asked climbers not to walk up its 1,156m peak\n\nWilpena Pound (pictured) in South Australia's mighty Flinders Ranges features St Mary Peak, which the local indigenous people have stated they would prefer tourists did not climb\n\n'It'd be similar to people going to the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge and graffitiing. That would\u00adn't be accepted there, so why should it be acceptable for such an important place here? The sheer number of people climbing is unsustainable.'\n\nMuch the same requests are made about St Mary Peak, the highest point of Wilpena Pound in South Australia's Flinders Ranges at 1,171m, to show respect for the Adnyamathanha people's beliefs.\n\nAdnyamathanha elder Jimmy Neville told The Australian last year that St Mary Peak was central to his people's creation story and asked climbers not to ascend the summit.\n\n'If people aren't going to listen to us, then yes, I'd personally ban it\u2026 I'd love to see that happen,' Mr Neville said. 'It's merely because of cultural reasons that we ask walkers not to go.'", "description": "The region's Jinibara people have been battling the Queensland Government for decades to close off Mount Beerwah, in Queensland's Glass House Mountains.", "authors": ["Aidan Wondracz", "Stephen Gibbs For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20356346-0-image-a-2_1572399693087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
