That\u2019s how bubbles get created.\n\nBack in 1999, everyone thought you could do no wrong by investing in tech stocks and Internet stocks. Then the NASDAQ crashed 70%.\n\nLast year, everyone thought marijuana stocks would all go through the roof because of the massive short squeeze in Tilray. Now, most of those stocks have fallen by more than 50%.\n\nEvery time you hear about the hot new thing, or see some security being bid up to the moon, you should immediately be suspicious. You must invest or trade with extreme caution.\n\nThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about bitcoin.\n\nThe bulls don\u2019t want to hear any arguments. They are true believers, and when that zeal approaches the level of religious fervor \u2013 which it did long ago \u2013 the writing is on the wall.\n\nHere are the three biggest myths about bitcoin that you must be aware of, as either an investor or trader. Don\u2019t buy into them. If you approach these myths with the proper skepticism, you will save yourself a lot of money.\n\nMyth #1: Bitcoin Is A Store of Value\n\n\u201cStore of value\u201d \u2013 those three words \u2013 should be self-explanatory. It means you can convert fiat currency into some other form, in which the underlying value of that fiat currency will remain relatively stable. The value of the currency is stored.\n\nOne look at any bitcoin chart will tell you this is a myth.\n\nBitcoin does not store value because of its volatility. Bitcoin\u2019s price might move 15% in a matter of minutes. There is no value to be stored when that value could literally evaporate in minutes.\n\nEven at the height of the mortgage crisis, when the value of homes crashed, that downturn occurred over a period of months.\n\nIn certain neighborhoods, it took a matter of weeks, but it didn\u2019t happen in a matter of minutes.\n\nReal estate is a store of value. Even something as illiquid as art will not ever experience the kind of volatility that bitcoin does.\n\nMyth #2: Bitcoin Doesn\u2019t Need to Be Backed by Anything\n\nI have never seen a bitcoin bull make an affirmative argument regarding bitcoin not being backed by anything.\n\nIf you tell a bitcoin lover that bitcoin is a foolish investment because it isn\u2019t backed by anything, the only thing they ever say is that, \u201cneither is anything else!\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t offer an argument as to why not being backed by anything matters. Instead, they respond with a logical fallacy.\n\nNot only that, they\u2019re wrong.\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously discussed, fiat currency across much of the world, and especially in the United States, is backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.\n\nBefore anyone laughs at that, the point is that this full faith and credit has existed for over 150 years.\n\nPeople trust in the U.S. dollar, as evidenced by its complete lack of volatility.\n\nMyth #3: Bitcoin Will Be Accepted Everywhere\n\nEd Butowsky, Managing Partner at Chapwood Capital Investment Management, tells CCN:\n\n\u201cAside from a few companies that accept bitcoin as a publicity stunt, no business in their right mind would accept bitcoin. The volatility is such that a customer who buys something for $100 gets the full value of that item, while the merchant may end up with far less by the time he converts bitcoin back into currency. That could destroy entire businesses\u201d.\n\nButowsky is absolutely right. The entire underlying concept of any form of currency is rooted in the knowledge that the currency\u2019s value is stable.\n\nBitcoin will never be broadly accepted unless and until its volatility is comparative to that of the U.S. dollar. I don\u2019t believe that they will ever arrive.\n\nBitcoin is a bubble that will pop.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely those of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, CCN.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bitcoin-bubble-ss.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
