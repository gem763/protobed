It\u2019s quite tiring, so I\u2019ve always been quite pro carbs \u2013 I think they\u2019re a great thing. I probably eat about 300-350g of carbs a day.\n\n\"About 160g of protein, about 60-80g of fat, which I think is about 2,500-3,000 calories.\n\n\"Carbs get a bad press, but they\u2019re pretty important. I\u2019ve stayed pretty lean, I\u2019m about five kilos lighter than I was a couple of months ago.\n\n\"Which is fine, I think \u2013 it helps with the dancing.\"\n\nKelvin goes on to explain his lengthy dance training sessions, revealing he's taught the moves on Monday and by Tuesday lunchtime he knows the routine by heart.\n\nHe then spends the rest of the week perfecting it.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHowever, the hunky telly star admits his hard core regime has taken a toll on family life as he barely gets anytime with his wife and kids.\n\nHe says: \"I\u2019ve only got my family in the morning from 7am until 8.15am, which is my dad time.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a lot at all. By the time I get home I\u2019ve missed bath time and story time \u2013 that\u2019s a challenging thing...\n\n\"Every night I\u2019m getting home late. I miss my 7pm tea \u2013 dinner, whatever you call your evening meal \u2013 and I\u2019ll have it at 10.30pm at night.\"\n\nKelvin does allow himself a once a week treat, revealing he sinks a beer on Friday nights to help him relax on the night before the big show.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
