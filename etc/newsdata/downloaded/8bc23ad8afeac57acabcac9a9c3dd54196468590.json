Now it seems you think you\u2019re God. OK. Whatever, gurl.\u201d\n\nDressed ostensibly as Mary Magdalene at one point in the clip, Rainbow suggests, in song, that the president\u2019s best course of action would be to \u201cclose your mouth and delete all your socials tonight.\u201d\n\nAt the chorus, Rainbow belts out, \u201cCheeto Christ, Cheeto Christ, he\u2019s like if Jesus were pumpkin-spiced\u201d \u2015 a twist on the \u201cSuperstar\u201d song\u2019s original lyrics of \u201cJesus Christ, Jesus Christ, who are you? What have you sacrificed?\u201d\n\nLast week, Rainbow said in an interview with CNN that he saw his political satire as a means of healing with humor during turbulent times.\n\n\u201cI understand now that what I\u2019m doing is really even more important than I knew. I think it\u2019s just a testament to how healing and important \u2014 especially in times like this \u2014 humor is.\u201d\n\nWatch the full \u201cCheeto Christ Stupid-Czar\u201d music video here:", "description": "\"Cheeto Christ Stupid-Czar\" is the comedian's take on Trump calling himself the chosen one -- set to the tunes of the \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" musical.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6870fe3c00005100480f64.png?cache=mxyu3ni7h3&ops=1778_1000"}
