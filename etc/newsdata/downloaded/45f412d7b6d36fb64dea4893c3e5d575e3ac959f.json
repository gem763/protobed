The game no one really wants to play in, but have to, after falling at the final hurdle in the pursuit of a World Cup final place.\n\nThe game either goes the way of free-flowing rugby as players cut loose or ends up as a damp squib of a match, with minds already elsewhere.\n\nTwenty teams started off RWC 2019 with the goal of becoming world champions - England and South Africa the last two standing after seeing off the All Blacks and Welsh respectively.\n\nNew Zealand will concede their crown on Saturday but first up on Friday, they play a Wales side looking to try to match the third-place finish they achieved in 1987.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nFriday, November 1, 2019.\n\nWhat time does it kick-off?\n\n9am GMT, 6pm local (JST).\n\nWhere is it being held?\n\nTokyo Stadium, Japan.", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Austin Healey", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/29/Capture-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpJliwavx4coWFCaEkEsb3kvxIt-lGGWCWqwLa_RXJU8.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
