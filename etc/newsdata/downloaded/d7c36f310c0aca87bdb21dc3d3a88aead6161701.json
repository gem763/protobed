Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNo one personifies the team, which evened the best-of-seven series at 2-2 on Saturday, better than third baseman Alex Bregman.\n\nAfter a sensational regular season, the potential American League MVP\u2019s bat was relatively quite through the first three games of the series.\n\nBut it came to life in a big way on Saturday when the 25-year-old belted a grand slam off a fastball from reliever Fernando Rodney to put his team just two wins away for their second championship in three years.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to hit the ball in the air and drive in a run and I ended up driving in four,\u201d Bregman said.\n\n\u201cWhat a great team win. We did a great job applying pressure.\u201d\n\nBregman\u2019s slam was all the sweeter because in Game Three the Nationals chose to walk Michael Brantley in the seventh inning to get to Bregman in a move that paid off for the Nationals when he grounded out.\n\nHis teammates said they knew that the intentional walk had gotten under his skin and that he would get his revenge to ensure a Game Six in Houston on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those moments where you think that he\u2019s going to go off,\u201d said Astros outfielder Josh Reddick.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019d probably be the most mad guy that would get in that situation to get intentionally walked to him.\n\n\u201cReally, you\u2019re walking that guy to get to me? Hell with that. I think he\u2019s the guy who really lives for those moments.\u201d\n\nThe underdog Nationals will look to rebound in Game Five in Washington on Sunday before the series moves back to Houston.", "description": "Through the first two games of the World Series the Houston Astros looked nothing like the team that won 107 games this season but, with their 8-1 route of the Washington Nationals in Game Four, the team has returned to form.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445545022&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0KQ-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
