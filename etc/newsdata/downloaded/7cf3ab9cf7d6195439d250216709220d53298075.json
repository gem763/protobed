This is despite the \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.2bn)deal signed with the EU in 2016, in which Europe agreed to help Turkey with the costs of hosting the refugees.\n\nWhile it is illegal to forcibly deport people to Syria, as it exposes them to a real risk of serious human rights violations, Turkey claims that all those who return to Syria do so voluntarily. Turkish officials say 315,000 people have left for Syria on a voluntary basis.\n\nHowever, according to the report, which interviewed Syrian deportees between July and September, Turkish authorities took handcuffed refugees back to Syria on buses before creating the \u201csafe zones\u201d.\n\nSome of the people to whom researchers spoke said they were beaten or threatened with violence to force them to sign \u201cvoluntary return\u201d documents. Others were told they were signing a registration document, a confirmation of having received a blanket from a detention centre, or a form that expressed their desire to remain in Turkey.\n\nWhile the report admits there are no official statistics on such deportations, it suggests, based on dozens of interviews, that the number of illegal deportations may amount to hundreds, and that many people were coerced or misled when signing \u201cvoluntary return\u201d documents.\n\nThe Amnesty report confirms already mounting evidence of a crackdown on Syrian refugees inside Turkey since the summer. Many refugees describe being stopped by police officers in train stations and other public places and asked to show a Turkish ID card, known as the \u201ckimlik\u201d.\n\nOn the frontline as US troops leave northern Syria \u2013 podcast Read more\n\nAmong the cases highlighted in the report is that of Qasim (not his real name), a 39-year-old father from Aleppo. He said he was detained in a police station in the Turkish city of Konya for six days, where officers reportedly told him: \u201cYou have a choice. One or two months, or a year, in prison \u2013 or you go to Syria.\u201d\n\nIn a second case, John, a Syrian Christian, told a similar story, alleging that Turkish migration officials told him: \u201cIf you ask for a lawyer, we will keep you six or seven months, and we will hurt you.\u201d\n\nHe was deported after being caught by the Turkish coastguard while trying to get to Greece, and said that after arriving in Syria he was detained for a week in Idlib by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Al-Qaida-linked group formerly known as al-Nusra Front. \u201cIt was a miracle I got out alive,\u201d he said.\n\nAnna Shea, Amnesty International\u2019s researcher on refugee and migrant rights, said: \u201cIt is chilling that Turkey\u2019s deal with Russia this week agrees to the \u2018safe and voluntary return\u2019 of refugees to a yet to-be-established \u2018safe zone\u2019.\n\n\u201cReturns until now have been anything but safe and voluntary \u2013 and now millions more refugees from Syria are at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s claim that refugees from Syria are choosing to walk straight back into the conflict is dangerous and dishonest. Our research shows that people are being tricked or forced into returning,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cTurkey deserves recognition for hosting more than 3.6 million women, men and children from Syria for more than eight years, but it cannot use this generosity as an excuse to flout international and domestic law by deporting people to an active conflict zone.\u201d", "description": "Amnesty claims people bussed out in handcuffs were beaten or signed \u2018voluntary return\u2019 forms in belief they would get blankets", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0d1bd37fcecc77f1c2caf111b531d782a75d99c/0_211_3265_1959/master/3265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bfba31ec28be7b01feab1e1999c6ad38", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
