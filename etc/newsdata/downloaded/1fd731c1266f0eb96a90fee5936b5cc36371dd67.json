Sadly however, Albo has shown it\u2019s just too hard for him.\"\n\nIn his speech, Dr Chalmers said Labor always preferred multilateral trade deals over \"poorer quality\" bilateral agreements and he acknowledged there were legitimate arguments for and against the deals with Peru, Hong Kong and Indonesia.\n\n\"We make these calls on balance,'' he said.\n\n\"We support these deals because we recognise that more and bigger markets can mean more and better jobs, as long as we get the details right and that\u2019s why we are pushing for improvements.\"\n\nHe reiterated Labor would push for changes to better protect Australian jobs and introduce safeguards and carve-outs in ISDS clauses.\n\nTrade Minister Simon Birmingham said the government would consider Labor's request to abolish a 1993 bilateral agreement with Indonesia which contained no ISDS safeguards and, if not abolished, could override the newly-negotiated ISDS clause in the FTA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Chalmers said he appreciated frustrations with global trade, and said the US/China trade war was an example of the flaws.\n\n\"The US has gained massively from its engagement in the international economy over the years and continues to do so. But the average US worker hasn\u2019t necessarily felt enough of the benefits,'' he said.\n\n\"The better path forward, and the Labor way, is to combine open and fair markets with effective social and economic policies to ensure that parts of our community don\u2019t get left behind.\n\n\"We want trade to work for working people, not at their expense.\"", "description": "Unions are backing motions that would expel Labor MPs who abandon job protections in free trade deals as anger rises at the party for siding with the Coalition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2047%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce73bd911442ca619fbf15aca97b871f23d8e88f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
