The tumours have now left Darcy paralysed from the waist down.\n\nIn January, she was given just a few months to live but her mum said: \u201cShe is still here and fighting strong.\u201d\n\nDarcy spends her time between home and Rachel House Children\u2019s Hospice in Kinross.\n\nHer family have raised thousands of pounds for CHAS, with more events planned.\n\nBoth NHS Lothian and NHS Fife said they were unable to comment on individual patients for reasons of confidentiality.\n\n\u25cf To support her fundraising, visit the Facebook page Darcy Rae' Dreams .", "description": "Darcy McGuire, from Fife, Scotland, was given the devastating news that she has rare chordoma in January after four agonising years", "authors": ["Claire Elliot", "Lorraine King"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534971.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SCT_20191006Darcy3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
