During that incident, Santos was said to have jumped over a desk, grabbed a man by the neck and bitten him on the chest.\n\nIt's unclear whether Santos was charged in any of those incidents or why he was released from custody following those incidents.\n\nThe NYPD officers had responded to a 911 assault call in Chinatown at about 1.49am Saturday, where they found an unconscious man in his 60s on the ground with severe head trauma.

'It doesn't seem anybody was targeted by race, age, anything of that nature.'\n\nWitnesses at the scene told offers that 'an unknown male, wearing a black jacket and black pants, struck the victim numerous times in the head with a three-foot long metal object covered in blood,' Baldassano said.\n\nOfficers immediately began searching the area for the suspect and found a male fitting the description and carrying the metal pipe, at the intersection of Mulberry Street and Canal Street in Chinatown.\n\nPolice said they arrested a 24-year-old man, now identified as Santos, and recovered the weapon without incident.\n\nOfficers then expanded the search and found three more victims around 4am.\n\nTwo male victims were found in front of 2 East Broadway and one in front of 17 East Broadway.\n\nAll three had severe head trauma and were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe killings started on The Bowery, which cuts through Chinatown and has for decades been known as New York's skid row, inhabited by homeless addicts and alcoholics\n\nA short time later, police arrested a 24-year-old man who was wielding a metal object in the vicinity of the last three murders\n\nAuthorities described the metal object as resembling a pipe.

'We're keeping the victims and their loved ones in our hearts tonight.'\n\nThe Post published photos of two of the victims under a white sheet, one slumped in a blood-spattered doorway.\n\nThe other lay under a sheet on the sidewalk. The identities of the victims have not been released.\n\nThe NYPD is conducting a street-by-street canvass for any additional victims and an investigation is ongoing.\n\nNew York City's homeless population has grown in recent years, to a great extent because of the lack of affordable housing.\n\nThe killings started on The Bowery, which cuts through Chinatown and has for decades been known as New York's skid row, inhabited by homeless addicts and alcoholics.\n\nDuring the day, the neighborhood is bustling with small businesses and street vendors offering discount goods, its sidewalks packed with pedestrians.\n\nLate at night, when the shops close, it turns into a quiet, desolate neighborhood that was the setting for Saturday's attacks.\n\nAnyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS.", "description": "Authorities said Randy Rodriguez Santos, 24, had been arrested 14 times prior to his Saturday arrest for allegedly beating to death four homeless men in New York City's Chinatown.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen", "Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19344806-0-image-a-29_1570313415642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
