Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off \u20ac2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show\u2019s 15 episodes than there are hostages. Netflix 2/20 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u20132018) Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It\u2019s been cancelled now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email. Netflix 3/20 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV \u2013 the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh \u2013 One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran / nurse / single mother \u2013 who suffers from PTSD and depression \u2013 would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process. Netflix 4/20 Private Life (Film, 2018) Based on writer / director Tamara Jenkins\u2019s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie\u2019s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It\u2019s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised. Netflix 5/20 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep dive into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show\u2019s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly \u2013 and seemingly disastrously \u2013 changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones; Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig\u2019s wonderful turn as a talking vagina. Netflix 6/20 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016\u2013) Joe Swanberg\u2019s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you\u2019ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams \u2013 who you might remember from Todd Solondz\u2019s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness \u2013 is the show\u2019s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul. Netflix 7/20 Love (TV series, three seasons, 2016\u20132018) Community\u2019s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely \u2013 and arguably deeply unwise \u2013 relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus\u2019s pathological need to be the nice guy, we\u2019re never quite sure who or what we\u2019re rooting for \u2013 which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing. Netflix 8/20 Patton Oswalt: Annihilation (stand-up special, 2017) In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cstand-up special\u201d, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone. Netflix 9/20 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Granted, this horror-comedy \u2013 which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh \u2013 is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it\u2019s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila\u2019s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair\u2019s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn\u2019t quite like anything else on TV right now. Netflix 10/20 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is \u2013 in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he\u2019s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier\u2019s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world\u2019s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier\u2019s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims. Netflix 11/20 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) Based on Vikram Chandra\u2019s epic 2006 novel, Netflix\u2019s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games \u2013 which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster \u2013 only covered one quarter of Chandra\u2019s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d. Netflix 12/20 Dumplin\u2019 (Film, 2018) When the trailer for Dumplin\u2019 first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin\u2019 such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described \u201cfat girl\u201d who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin\u2019 is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist \u2013 and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot. Netflix 13/20 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) This sci-fi thriller \u2013 which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties \u2013 has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things. Netflix 14/20 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017) Though it\u2019s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015\u2019s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992. Netflix 15/20 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 \u2013 meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward\u2019s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life. John O Flexor/Netflix 16/20 Set It Up (Film, 2018) Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term \u201cover-dicking\u201d (it\u2019s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre. Netflix 17/20 Cargo (Film, 2017) Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable spanners in the works. Netflix 18/20 3% (TV series, two season, 2016\u2013) Like a cross between The Hunger Games and CW series The 100, this Brazilian dystopian thriller, set in an unspecified future, revolves largely around an impoverished community known as the Inland. Every year, each 20-year-old takes part in a series of tests; the highest scoring 3% will be chosen to live in paradise in the Offshore. It is an intriguing and addictive commentary on class and privilege. Netflix 19/20 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) With shades of John Ford's The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it's about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws\u2019 pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special.

But the title Annie Hall was eventually settled on, inspired by actress Diane Keaton's real name, Diane Hall, and her nickname, Annie. United Artists 2/27 Dynasty (1981-89) Original title: Oil Oil The hit series, which revolves around the family of an oil magnate, was originally supposed to be titled\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Oil. But it was then changed to Dynasty to compete with rival soap Dallas. CBS Television Distribution 3/27 Back to the Future (1985) Original title: Spaceman from Pluto Spaceman from Pluto Steven Spielberg genuinely thought the title Spaceman from Pluto was a joke suggestion, so it didn\u2019t last long, and was soon replaced by the now iconic name Back to the Future. He contacted the Universal Studios head Sid Sheinberg who had suggested the Pluto title, with a message thanking him for sending his wonderful \"joke\" name, saying the office \"got a kick out of it\". Ouch. Universal Pictures 4/27 The Breakfast Club (1985) Original title: The Lunch Bunch The Lunch Bunch The original script for this classic high-school movie went by the very naff name The Lunch Bunch, but thanks to the son of one of director John Hughes's friends, who had a school detention class called The Breakfast Club, the title was changed. Universal Pictures 5/27 Fatal Attraction (1987) Original title: Affairs of the Heart Affairs of the Heart The much friendlier sounding Affairs of the Heart wasn\u2019t a great match for the psychological thriller that brought us the bunny boiler, and after it received a poor reception from audiences, the film\u2019s title was changed to Fatal Attraction. Paramount Pictures 6/27 Licence to Kill (1989) Original title: Licence Revoked Licence Revoked This Bond film was, at one time, called Licence Revoked, but test audiences associated the title too much with driving, so thankfully it was changed to something far punchier. United Artists 7/27 Saved by the Bell (1989-93) Original title: Good Morning, Miss Bliss Good Morning, Miss Bliss NBC\u2019s Good Morning Miss Bliss centred on Hayley Mills as the eponymous teacher but, after the comedy briefly moved to the Disney Channel and then back to NBC, it was re-tooled to focus on the teenage students instead, therefore taking on a new name: Saved By The Bell. CBS Studios International 8/27 Goodfellas (1990) Original title: Wiseguy Wiseguy The Scorsese classic is an adaptation of a mobster novel called Wiseguy, which was originally also the title of the film, but the name had to be changed because it had already been taken for an 80s TV series. Warner Bros 9/27 Pretty Woman (1990) Original title: 3000 3000 Originally a dark drama about class and sex work, Pretty Woman\u2019s first title was 3,000 \u2013 the amount of money that Richard Gere's character Edward spends on a week of Vivian's (Julia Roberts) time. Disney changed the name as it came across as \u201ctoo science-fictiony\u201d, as well as the tone of the movie which was turned into a rom-com fairytale. Buena Vista Pictures 10/27 Friends (1994-2004) Original title: Six of One Six of One The beloved sitcom went through many different name changes, with all the following titles considered: Friends Like Us, Six of One, Across the Hall, Once Upon a Time in the West Village, and Insomnia Cafe. It\u2019s now hard to imagine the show becoming such a monumental hit with any of those names. Warner Bros Television Distribution 11/27 Pulp Fiction (1994) Original title: Black Mask Black Mask Pulp Fiction was initially inspired by the detective crime stories in the seminal magazine Black Mask, hence its first name. The publication was a pulp magazine, which goes some way to explaining the new title. Miramax Films 12/27 Titanic (1997) Original title: The Ship of Dreams The Ship of Dreams In a line from the classic 1997 film, the older version of Rose says: \"Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was.\" It was also the original title of the film, before the simpler name of Titanic was chosen. 20th Century Fox 13/27 That '70s Show (1998-2006) Original title: Teenage Wasteland Teenage Wasteland Early ideas for the 70s sitcom\u2019s name included Teenage Wasteland and The Kids Are Alright, but because the creators couldn\u2019t get song title rights from The Who, they were forced to change the name of the show. Carsey-Werner Distribution 14/27 American Pie (1999) Original title: Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate It was a bold move from screenwriter Adam Herz when he submitted his spec script to studios under the title Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But The Executive Will Hate. But the risk paid off, with the film, eventually named American Pie, grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide. Universal Pictures 15/27 Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) Original title: Dairy Queens Dairy Queens The black comedy was originally supposed to be called Dairy Queens. However, the company that owns fast food chain Dairy Queen apparently didn't love the idea of being associated with the movie, so they filed a lawsuit and, lo and behold, Drop Dead Gorgeous was born. New Line Cinema 16/27 8 Simple Rules (2002-03) Original title: 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter This family sitcom originally had a longer name, but when star John Ritter \u2013 who played the concerned father in the show \u2013 suddenly died after filming the third episode of the second series, the show changed its format and name to 8 Simple Rules and Ritter\u2019s death was written into the plot. Buena Vista International Television 17/27 Cars (2006) Original title: Route 66 Route 66 The animated hit was initially called Route 66 after the iconic road in America, but the title was changed to Cars to avoid confusion with a 60s TV show of the same name. Buena Vista Pictures 18/27 Hannah Montana (2006-11) Original title: Alexis Texas Alexis Texas Miley Cyrus\u2019s Disney comedy was originally called Alexis Texas but, because a porn actor shares the same name, it had to be changed in case children looked up the show\u2019s title and accidentally found pornography. Disney-ABC Domestic Television 19/27 The Big Bang Theory (2007-19) Original title: Lenny, Penny and Kenny Lenny, Penny and Kenny The Big Bang Theory\u2019s original rhyming title was forced to change after the character Kenny\u2019s name switched to Sheldon, who was then brought to life by Jim Parsons. Warner Bros Television Distribution 20/27 Samantha Who? (2007-09) Original title: Sam I Am Sam I Am Clearance issues with the estate of Dr Seuss led ABC to change the name of its Christina Applegate-led show, as the original title, Sam I Am, drew on the first lines of Dr Seuss\u2019s classic Green Eggs and Ham. Disney \u2013 ABC Domestic Television 21/27 The Good Wife (2009-16) Original title: Leave the Bastard Leave the Bastard The Good Wife\u2019s creators got a call from CBS pushing them to change the title just as it went into production. The network did actually consider Leave the Bastard, but ultimately decided to play it safe with The Good Wife. CBS Television Distribution 22/27 Shutter Island (2010) Original title: Ashecliffe Ashecliffe Ashecliffe, the name of the hospital in Martin Scorcese\u2019s thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was originally going to be the film\u2019s title before it was changed to Shutter Island. Paramount Pictures 23/27 New Girl (2011-18) Original title: Chicks and Dicks Chicks and Dicks New Girl was initially pitched as \"a young ensemble comedy about the sexual politics of men and women\u201d, hence its original, provocative title: Chicks and Dicks. Not only did this name attract the wrong kind of attention, but New Girl better reflected the content of the sitcom, which ended up revolving around Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Jess. 20th Television 24/27 Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Original title: All You Need Is Kill All You Need Is Kill The Tom Cruise action movie was originally known as All You Need Is Kill, the title of the book on which the movie is based, but filmmakers changed the title because they felt the word \"kill\" was too problematic. \"I think the word 'kill' in a title is very tricky in today's world\u2026\" producer Edwin Stoff said. \u201cWe see it enough in real newspaper headlines, and I don't think we need to see it when we're looking at a movie.\" After a lucklustre box office opening, the film's name was changed once again, in marketing and for home release, to Live, Die, Repeat. Warner Bros Pictures 25/27 Lovesick (2014-18) Original title: Scrotal Recall Scrotal Recall The relationship comedy drama starring Johnny Flynn was renamed after one series because, perhaps unsurprisingly, it was suffering from a lack of word of mouth, with people reluctant to say the word \u201cscrotal\u201d. Clerkenwell Films 26/27 Stranger Things (2016-) Original title: Montauk Montauk The original title of the Netflix hit was Montauk, as the plan had been for it to be set in a village of the same name in New York. However, when creators the Duffer brothers later relocated the show\u2019s action to the fictional town of Hawkins in Indiana, the name changed to Stranger Things. Intriguingly, Montauk also happens to be the title of a short film which the Duffer brothers were accused of plagiarising. Netflix 27/27 Arrival (2017) Original title: Story of Your Life Story of Your Life The sci-fi film starring Amy Adams originally went by the title of the novella it was based on, Story of Your Life, but because producer Shawn Levy thought it \"sounds a bit like a One Direction song\u201d and \"multiword titles can be really problematic\u201d, the movie changed its name to Arrival. Paramount Pictures 1/27 Annie Hall (1977) Original title: Anhedonia Anhedonia Annie Hall began life as Anhedonia, which is the scientific term for the inability to experience pleasure. But the title Annie Hall was eventually settled on, inspired by actress Diane Keaton's real name, Diane Hall, and her nickname, Annie. United Artists 2/27 Dynasty (1981-89) Original title: Oil Oil The hit series, which revolves around the family of an oil magnate, was originally supposed to be titled\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Oil. But it was then changed to Dynasty to compete with rival soap Dallas. CBS Television Distribution 3/27 Back to the Future (1985) Original title: Spaceman from Pluto Spaceman from Pluto Steven Spielberg genuinely thought the title Spaceman from Pluto was a joke suggestion, so it didn\u2019t last long, and was soon replaced by the now iconic name Back to the Future. He contacted the Universal Studios head Sid Sheinberg who had suggested the Pluto title, with a message thanking him for sending his wonderful \"joke\" name, saying the office \"got a kick out of it\". Ouch. Universal Pictures 4/27 The Breakfast Club (1985) Original title: The Lunch Bunch The Lunch Bunch The original script for this classic high-school movie went by the very naff name The Lunch Bunch, but thanks to the son of one of director John Hughes's friends, who had a school detention class called The Breakfast Club, the title was changed. Universal Pictures 5/27 Fatal Attraction (1987) Original title: Affairs of the Heart Affairs of the Heart The much friendlier sounding Affairs of the Heart wasn\u2019t a great match for the psychological thriller that brought us the bunny boiler, and after it received a poor reception from audiences, the film\u2019s title was changed to Fatal Attraction. Paramount Pictures 6/27 Licence to Kill (1989) Original title: Licence Revoked Licence Revoked This Bond film was, at one time, called Licence Revoked, but test audiences associated the title too much with driving, so thankfully it was changed to something far punchier. United Artists 7/27 Saved by the Bell (1989-93) Original title: Good Morning, Miss Bliss Good Morning, Miss Bliss NBC\u2019s Good Morning Miss Bliss centred on Hayley Mills as the eponymous teacher but, after the comedy briefly moved to the Disney Channel and then back to NBC, it was re-tooled to focus on the teenage students instead, therefore taking on a new name: Saved By The Bell. CBS Studios International 8/27 Goodfellas (1990) Original title: Wiseguy Wiseguy The Scorsese classic is an adaptation of a mobster novel called Wiseguy, which was originally also the title of the film, but the name had to be changed because it had already been taken for an 80s TV series. Warner Bros 9/27 Pretty Woman (1990) Original title: 3000 3000 Originally a dark drama about class and sex work, Pretty Woman\u2019s first title was 3,000 \u2013 the amount of money that Richard Gere's character Edward spends on a week of Vivian's (Julia Roberts) time. Disney changed the name as it came across as \u201ctoo science-fictiony\u201d, as well as the tone of the movie which was turned into a rom-com fairytale. Buena Vista Pictures 10/27 Friends (1994-2004) Original title: Six of One Six of One The beloved sitcom went through many different name changes, with all the following titles considered: Friends Like Us, Six of One, Across the Hall, Once Upon a Time in the West Village, and Insomnia Cafe. It\u2019s now hard to imagine the show becoming such a monumental hit with any of those names. Warner Bros Television Distribution 11/27 Pulp Fiction (1994) Original title: Black Mask Black Mask Pulp Fiction was initially inspired by the detective crime stories in the seminal magazine Black Mask, hence its first name. The publication was a pulp magazine, which goes some way to explaining the new title. Miramax Films 12/27 Titanic (1997) Original title: The Ship of Dreams The Ship of Dreams In a line from the classic 1997 film, the older version of Rose says: \"Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was.\" It was also the original title of the film, before the simpler name of Titanic was chosen. 20th Century Fox 13/27 That '70s Show (1998-2006) Original title: Teenage Wasteland Teenage Wasteland Early ideas for the 70s sitcom\u2019s name included Teenage Wasteland and The Kids Are Alright, but because the creators couldn\u2019t get song title rights from The Who, they were forced to change the name of the show. Carsey-Werner Distribution 14/27 American Pie (1999) Original title: Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate It was a bold move from screenwriter Adam Herz when he submitted his spec script to studios under the title Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But The Executive Will Hate. But the risk paid off, with the film, eventually named American Pie, grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide.

Paramount Pictures\n\nWhat do we know?\n\nConsidering the dust is just settling after the huge events of the third season\u2019s finale, not much.\n\nThe closing moments of the season saw Joyce adopt a grieving Eleven and move out of Hawkins, Indiana with her sons Will and Jonathan. Last we saw, Eleven had lost the ability to move objects with her mind after defeating the Mindflayer.\n\nSpeaking about the fourth season, showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer told Entertainment Weekly that the show would be following Joyce and co outside of Hawkins.\n\n\u201c[Season four is] going to open up a little bit...not necessarily in terms of scale, in terms of special effects, but open up in terms of allowing plotlines into areas outside of Hawkins.\u201d\n\nOne intriguing point they\u2019ve mentioned a few times is that season four could be the show\u2019s last, with Matt Duffer telling Vulture: \u201cWe just have to keep adjusting the story \u2013 though I don\u2019t know if we can justify something bad happening to them once a year.\u201d\n\nIs Hopper alive?\n\nThis is the million dollar question. It\u2019s hard to be convinced that the Duffers would kill off one of the show\u2019s most popular characters, especially upon considering his death, which occurred during the explosion underneath Starcourt Mall, is still unconfirmed.\n\nDid Hopper escape through the door to the Upside Down before the blast? Backing up this thought is the show\u2019s mid-credits sequence: in Russia, a soldier standing guard of cell doors, refers to one of its occupants as \u201cthe American\u201d and many fans have assumed \u2013 well, hoped \u2013 this could be referring to Hopper (although one theory suggests it could be someone else entirely).\n\nSo, what clues are there? It\u2019s all a bit tenuous, but hear us out.\n\nA fan theory from Politico\u2019s Bill Kuchman likens Hopper\u2019s arc to Han Solo\u2019s right down to the moment they say \u201cSee you in hell\u201d before seemingly dying.\n\nSolo ends up surviving, which is revealed in Return of the Jedi. Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrisian save their buddy from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt who feeds his prisoners into the Sarlacc Pit.\n\nIf Hopper is \u201cthe American\u201d, then a parallel could be drawn between the two characters\u2019 respective captors. After all, the Russians can be seen feeding their prisoners to the Demogorgon a the end of the mid-credits sequence.\n\nThen there\u2019s the words of Matt Duffer who appear to have given the game away in a podcast interview with Entertainment Weekly.\n\n\u201cWe always talk about Empire Strikes Back \u2013 we always wanted to give him a darker ending, we always wanted to give him a Han Solo sacrifice moment.\u201d\n\nTo cap it all off, what film does Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) mention in the rental shop in the finale\u2019s epilogue? that\u2019s right \u2013 The Return of the Jedi.\n\nHarbour himself said he doesn\u2019t \u201c...really know what\u2019s going on\u201d when asked if he\u2019ll return in season four. That\u2019s not a no...\n\nBut, wait \u2013 there is one more huge clue hinting at Hopper\u2019s fate.\n\nAt one stage in season three, viewers hear the phone number of Murray Bauman. Some fans have been calling this number \u2013 618-625-8313 \u2013 and are very intrigued by what they discovered: a message from Bauman to Ryder\u2018s Joyce seemingly given after the events of the finale.\n\nIt goes: \u201cHi, you have reached the residence of Murray Bauman. Mom, if this is you, please hang up and call me between the hours of 5 and 6pm as previously discussed, okay? If this is Joyce: Joyce, thank you for calling, I have been trying to reach you. I have an update. It\u2019s about... well, it\u2019s probably best if we speak in person. It\u2019s not good or bad, but it\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nGoing by what happens in the season three finale \u2013 namely Jim Hopper (David Harbour) seemingly dying \u2013 could Murray\u2019s \u201cupdate\u201d be to do with their mutual friend? Could he be alive after all?\n\nA wrinkle in all of this promise comes via an Instagram post that Harbour posted in August 2019. The new Marvel star wrote:\n\n\u201cEven as I move into this magical @marvelstudios world with colossal talents like @salmahayek ... My heart still bleeds for them. And the life that could have been. Post a romantic Enzo\u2019s eve.\u201d\n\nBy them, he clearly means Hopper and Ryder's character Joyce \u2013 with Enzo's being the place they were supposed to go on a date. Are there any other theories?\n\nThere are indeed. Following the conclusion of season three, one Reddit user predicted what could happen in the show\u2019s fourth run \u2013 and they believe it could see the series depict a real-world catastrophe.\n\nThe theory goes that the next season will take place around April 1986 when the Chernobyl disaster occurred. The third season ended in October 1985, so this would place the action a whole six months later.\n\nThey go onto suggest that Chernobyl could end up being caused or indeed fabricated in an attempt to cover-up a battle involving Eleven, the Russians introduced in season three and a whole host of other creatures, including the one seen in that mid-credits sequences.\n\nAnother theory is based on potential hints dropped in season three regarding Will\u2019s sexuality.\n\nOne scene from the Netflix show\u2019s third episode, titled \u201cThe Case of the Missing Lifeguard\u201d, appeared to hint the character might be gay as Wolfhard\u2019s character Mike Wheeler shouts at his friend, played by Noah Schnapp: \u201dIt\u2019s not my fault you don\u2019t like girls.\u201d\n\nWolfhard claims that this particular line isn\u2019t as clear-cut as you think considering there were several variants he was asked to deliver.", "description": "The dust has settled on another season of Stranger Things\u2019\u00a0third run, but fans are desperate for more. Season three was considered a step up from the second outing that was released in 2017, even if it ended with a traumatising moment that fans are hoping isn\u2019t real.
