They run all over the world trying to find survival,\" Khawe told reporters at a protest outside the US embassy on Friday.\n\nBoth the US and the EU have defended their stance.\n\n\"The biggest sanctions on Zimbabwe are the limitations it puts on itself,\" tweeted the US ambassador to Harare, Brian Nichols. \"That should be the focus of the government.\"\n\nThe EU said it had only imposed an arms embargo, a travel and asset freeze against Mugabe and his wife, and a ban on doing business with Zimbabwean defence companies.\n\nThe US embassy also blasted Zimbabwe's government for corruption and alleged embezzlement.\n\nMnangagwa has come under fire since January, when at least 17 people were killed and scores wounded after the army brutally broke up a protest against rising fuel prices.\n\nAmnesty International and several other rights groups have accused Mnangagwa of human rights abuses.", "description": "Zimbabweans staged a mass government-orchestrated protest on Friday against sanctions imposed by the US and the European Union during the despotic rule of late ex-leader Robert Mugabe.
