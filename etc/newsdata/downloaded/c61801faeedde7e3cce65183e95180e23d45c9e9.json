We have such an incredible opportunity, being professional football players. We have incredible platforms. I ask everyone here \u2013 lend your platform to other people, lift other people up, share your success.\n\n\u201cWe have a unique opportunity in football to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. I hope you take that to heart, and just do something, do anything. We have incredible power in this room.\u201d\n\nRapinoe won the award ahead of international team-mate Alex Morgan, who matched her in scoring six times during the summer\u2019s tournament in France, and England\u2019s Lucy Bronze, who was the Silver Ball winner at the World Cup.\n\nPA Sport also contributed to this report", "description": "Megan Rapinoe\u00a0delivered an inspirational speech\u00a0after claiming the women\u2019s player of the year at the Best FIFA Football awards.\u00a0 The USA star joined\u00a0Lionel Messi and Jurgen Klopp\u00a0among\u00a0the winners at the event in Milan.\u00a0 After shining at the World Cup to help the USWNT claim glory, Rapinoe also won the\u00a0Golden Boot and Golden Ball for best player.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/07/rapinoe-speech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
