He finished 3-for-4 with a walk, double and two-run home run while chipping in a run-saving catch for good-measure. And yet, when looking for missed opportunities in a 7-6 loss for the Braves in Game 1 of the NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals, it was hard not to look at Acu\u00f1a\u2019s very long single in the seventh inning.\n\nFacing Cardinals reliever John Brebbia with a 3-1 lead, Acu\u00f1a crushed a ball to right field. He admired the mighty wallop as he jogged down the first-base line, holding his bat nearly the whole way. He only let go when he saw the ball bounce off the wall, back into play. What looked like a homer and should have been a double for Acu\u00f1a turned into a very long, very frustrating single.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAcu\u00f1a nearly had a homer in the seventh inning. He ended up with three fewer bases. (Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images)\n\nThe inning got even worse when it ended with Acu\u00f1a being doubled off at second on a Josh Donaldson lineout.\n\nThis has happened before with Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\n\nAcu\u00f1a is no stranger to this type of play, as a similar thing happened in August under much lower stakes. Thought it was a homer, should have been a double, ended up as a single. Braves manager Brian Snitker benched Acu\u00f1a for that incident, and Acu\u00f1a accepted blame after the game.\n\nThursday\u2019s jog didn\u2019t lead to a benching, though Snitker said after the game the Braves were \u201ckind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there.\u201d\n\nBraves teammates not thrilled with Acu\u00f1a\n\nThe Braves were hit with several questions about Acu\u00f1a after the game, and their reactions ranged from frustrated to supportive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFreeman on Acu\u00f1a not running out the ball off the RF wall: \"it's frustrating. I think you have that conversation once. Kinda beat a dead horse if you keep having that same conversation over and over again. That can't happen in the Playoffs, can't happen in the regular season\" \u2014 Kevin McAlpin (@KevinMcAlpin) October 4, 2019\n\nAlbies on Acu\u00f1a not running out of the box: \"it's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there. He probably scores in that inning if he's at second base\" #Braves @680TheFan \u2014 Kevin McAlpin (@KevinMcAlpin) October 4, 2019\n\nMore Swanson on Acu\u00f1a: \"... In the moment anybody can be frustrated, including him. But that\u2019s nothing we can dwell on....\n\nHe\u2019s an unbelievable player and an unbelievable talent. We\u2019re lucky to have him on our side.\" (2/2) \u2014 David O'Brien (@DOBrienATL) October 4, 2019\n\nFirst time I've heard Albies and McCann criticize teammate's actions like they did tonight w/ Acu\u00f1a. Everyone asked on the record basically said, that can't happen. He knows it. Ozzie said they could've scored that inning. McCann said in the playoffs, 90 feet can mean everything. \u2014 David O'Brien (@DOBrienATL) October 4, 2019\n\nAcu\u00f1a did plenty to redeem himself\n\nAs easy as it is to put blame for the loss on Acu\u00f1a, it\u2019s hard to deny the Braves would have been even close to winning without him during the game.\n\nAcu\u00f1a pulled the Braves back within two runs in the ninth inning with a two-run homer, admiring the long ball as it actually turned out to be a homer.\n\nOf course, even that hit prompted some criticism of Acu\u00f1a after the game.\n\nCardinals closer also mad at Acu\u00f1a\n\nCardinals closer took issue with Acu\u00f1a\u2019s home run trot while speaking with reporters, saying the slow pace was disrespectful to him \u201cas a veteran player.\u201d The 28-year-old Martinez certainly complained like a veteran.\n\nThe Cardinals weren't thrilled by how Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. rounded the bases on his 9th inning homer, enough that Yadier Molina went to the mound to calm Carlos Martinez down afterwards.\n\n\n\nPostgame, Martinez said: \"I wanted him to respect the game & respect me as a veteran player.\" \u2014 Joe Trezza (@JoeTrezz) October 4, 2019\n\nWe can imagine that the Braves don\u2019t care as much about that critique.\n\nClearly, Acu\u00f1a screwed up in the seventh inning. It\u2019s the postseason, every hit matters, and so on. The Braves might have been able to squeeze out an extra run if he ended up at second base, and they ended up losing by one run.\n\nHopefully, this is the last we hear about the matter. After all, no one can say that they wouldn\u2019t want to have Acu\u00f1a on their side moving forward.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Braves outfielder thought he had a homer.
