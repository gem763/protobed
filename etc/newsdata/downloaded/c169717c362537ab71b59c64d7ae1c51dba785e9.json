both using mediums.\n\nBut Leclerc and Vettel were the first frontrunners to head out on soft Pirellis for qualifying simulation runs.\n\nLeclerc strung together a 1m17.072s lap to take top spot, only for Vettel to eclipse him by 0.465s moments later having been faster in all three sectors of the Mexico City circuit.\n\nThis meant Leclerc's second place was vulnerable and Verstappen later posted a 1m16.722s to secure second place and split the Ferraris.\n\nLeclerc had a high-speed spin in the esses late in the session while running on mediums, but was able to rejoin.\n\nMercedes driver Valtteri Bottas, who had a spin exiting the right-hander leading into the stadium section earlier in the session that was the result of a lock-up on entry, was fourth fastest.\n\nHe lapped 0.614s off the pace and was 0.349s quicker than Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who was fifth.\n\nDaniil Kvyat was the leading midfield runner for Toro Rosso, leaping ahead of team-mate Pierre Gasly after being among the final drivers to post a quick lap.\n\nGasly was rapid on the medium rubber, posting a time of 1m18.003 that at one stage had him as high as third, but slipped to seventh after failing to improve on fresh rubber.\n\nMcLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr survived a trip across the grass at Turn 1 to set the eighth-fastest time, almost two tenths faster than Renault's Nico Hulkenberg behind him.\n\nLando Norris rounded out the top 10 in the second McLaren, 1.742s off the pace and just 0.013s quicker than the lead Racing Point of Lance Stroll.\n\nSergio Perez was only 0.004s slower than his team-mate in 12th place, shading the second Renault of Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nAlfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen was among the first to go out on fresh softs and at one stage broke into the top 10, only to be shuffled back to 14th and 2.074s off the pace.\n\nHe was separated from 16th-placed team-mate Antonio Giovinazzi by the lead Haas of Romain Grosjean.\n\nKevin Magnussen, who had an off-track moment at Turn 1 late in the session, was 17th fastest in the second Haas, 0.662s quicker than the fastest Williams of George Russell.\n\nRobert Kubica was just over two tenths slower than his team-mate, but his time was easily quick enough to secure 19th place thanks to Albon's early lap time on mediums putting him last.\n\nPractice two times\n\n\n\nPos Driver Car Time Gap Laps 1 Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1m16.607s -
