But now it\u2019s into retirement for the model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always sad when one of the trusties has to retire,\u201d Stenson told the PGA Tour\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI knew long before I gave up on it that the new technology was better and more efficient. When the other one broke in 2017, in February, I was out at a tournament in Dubai and I had to put (a new fairway club) in. That thing that I put in for that week was much hotter.\u201d\n\nA familiar feel had long meant more to Stenson than any benefits from newer technology.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing there on the 72nd hole and you\u2019ve got to hit a shot to position yourself to win the tournament, you don\u2019t want to have something you picked up two days ago,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cYou want to have something you hit 5,000 shots with.\u201d\n\nThe old-style 3-wood was used by Stenson to win the 2016 British Open, the 2013 US PGA Tour playoff crown, a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics and to reach as high as second in the world rankings.\n\nStenson, seeking his first win since 2017 in Greensboro, will play the first two rounds alongside Americans Jason Dufner, a PGA Championship winner whose last victory came at the 2017 memorial, and Cameron Champ, who won the Safeway Open two weeks ago.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Sweden\u2019s Henrik Stenson is testing new 3-woods ahead of the US PGA Houston Open after bidding goodbye to a beloved club he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/08aef3_sweden-henrik-stenson-working-new-wood-he-opens-his-2019-20-us-pga-tour-campaign-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
