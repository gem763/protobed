The nonprofit news organization found just 3% of 100 million eligible taxpayers use Free File. That translated into about $1 billion each year in unneeded fees paid to tax-prep firms, ProPublica reported.\n\n\"Intuit has used deceptive practices to skirt its obligations under the IRS Free-Filing Agreement for years,\" according to consumer rights attorney Hassan Zavareei, a partner at Tycko & Zavareei, a public interest law firm. \"Instead of providing free services to low-income taxpayers, it has bilked them out of millions of dollars. At the same time, the federal government has failed to provide free services to those same vulnerable consumers based on this agreement.\"\n\nIntuit: \"Clear and fair\"\n\nAs in the past, Intuit disputed the allegations in Friday's lawsuit. \"Intuit is committed to offering free tax preparation services as demonstrated by more people filing their taxes for free with TurboTax than all other tax prep software companies combined,\" the company said in a statement. \"When Intuit has an opportunity to respond to these allegations in court, it will be shown that Intuit has at all times been clear and fair with its customers.\"\n\nFurther, in a blog post intended to dispel what Intuit calls \"myths\" about how it operates, the company said about 50 million taxpayers were eligible to use its free filing service in 2018, and that during the past five years, 55 million Americans have used its filing services without paying anything.\n\nMost TurboTax users pay $100 or more, according to the latest lawsuit, which comes four months after similar accusations were made against the company in a federal court in San Jose, California, in addition to a lawsuit filed against Intuit and H&R Block by the city of Los Angeles.\n\nSanta Clara County made its decision to file Friday's suit based on what a spokesperson claims is Intuit's \"egregious false advertising.\" The county \"hasn't made a determination one way or another about H&R Block,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIn May, H&R Block told CBS MoneyWatch that it offers four free tax filing programs. \"We are pleased that consumers' use of H&R Block's Free File program grew eight percent this tax season, exceeding the Free File program growth of 6 percent,\" it said at the time.", "description": "The TurboTax maker says it's \"clear and fair\" with customers, but a lawsuit alleges a bait-and-switch scheme", "authors": ["Kate Gibson", "Irina Ivanova"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/01/06/b5a866ee-de99-4546-ac3e-3e6297baea97/thumbnail/1200x630/a65a63f0e0c1630ff3f5416f239b3fba/turbotax.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
