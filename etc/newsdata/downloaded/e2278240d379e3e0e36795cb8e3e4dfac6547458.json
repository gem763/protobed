What she\u2019s arguing is that any increase in taxes will be more than offset by the reduction in costs that people will have to pay for health care under a government-run system. Premiums will be much lower; deductibles will be much lower; the price of medication will be lower. So what, Warren is suggesting, if middle-class families have to pay a bit more up front if their overall financial burden is going down? But for now, she\u2019s shying away from outlining the trade-off explicitly.\n\nThe distinction she is trying to make may seem wonky, but it goes to the heart of the risky politics that Democrats have long had to navigate in proposing major expansions to government services, and nowhere more so than in health care. Back in 1992, then\u2013Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton told voters he would not raise taxes to pay for his programs, but he pointedly declined to repeat the infamous \u201cRead my lips; no new taxes\u201d pledge that President George H. W. Bush made four years earlier and later broke. Ultimately, Clinton did raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nRead: A nation of pundits\n\nOver the years since, Democratic presidential candidates from Barack Obama to Hillary Clinton have clung to an unspoken rule: Proposals to raise taxes on the rich are okay, but tax increases on the middle class are out\u2014or at least not acknowledged.\n\nWarren is running on bold ideas, and climbing in the polls as something of a truth teller. At the debate in Detroit, she railed against \u201csmall ideas and spinelessness,\u201d and she implored her fellow Democrats not to be afraid of, or adopt, Republican attacks on Medicare for All. But she is facing competition from an even more candid rival in Sanders, who has said that middle-class taxes might have to rise to pay for truly universal health care.\n\nHer reluctance to acknowledge as much is a sign both of her evolution as a politician and her standing in the Democratic race. Warren\u2019s rising in the polls now, and she likely has at least one eye on the general election next year. And while she\u2019s betting that the country is ready for a real debate on government-run health care, she\u2019s sticking to her party\u2019s age-old wariness of telling middle-class families in a simple sound bite that their tax bill might go up.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
