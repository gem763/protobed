Since the Supreme Court relaxed a federal law that banned sports betting in May last year, the industry\u2019s heavyweights have been clamoring to make the most of the opportunities ahead.\n\nSports betting is now legal in 11 U.S. states, with others at various stages of legislation.\n\nFlutter, formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair , wasted little time, buying U.S. fantasy sports provider FanDuel shortly after the Supreme Court decision.\n\nRevenue climbed 18% to \u00a31 billion in the first half of the year, partly due to FanDuel\u2019s 50% market share in New Jersey, where online gambling is legal.\n\nThe company has since launched online betting in Pennsylvania, and said it was poised to move into more states pending legislation.\n\nGVC , William Hill and 888 have also all made major moves to get in on the action.\n\nCanadian gaming company The Stars Group, whose brands include PokerStars, acquired Sky Betting and Gaming in July last year for $4.7 billion - increasing its exposure to sports betting, which makes up the majority of Sky Bet\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe Stars Group also has a partnership with FOX Sports for the newly-launched FOX Bet, an online and mobile sports-betting platform.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Flutter Entertainment said it had agreed to buy The Stars Group, owner of Sky Bet, in an all-share deal that would create a global betting giant.\n\nThe company said the combined group\u2019s revenue would have been \u00a33.8 billion in 2018, making it the world\u2019s largest online betting company. It expects cost synergies to reach an annual \u00a3140 million.\n\nOnce completed, Flutter shareholders would own 54.64%, while Stars investors would hold 45.36%.\n\nThe combined group\u2019s core markets would remain the U.K., Ireland and Australia but Flutter said it was \u201cideally positioned\u201d to pursue the growing opportunities in the U.S.\n\nIt would also see Flutter enter into third-party arrangements with Fox Sports, Fastball Holdings and Boyd Interactive Gaming.\n\nLooking ahead. As U.K. betting firms rush to partner with their U.S. counterparts to make the most of the booming sports betting industry across the atlantic, Flutter may have just won big.\n\nRegulatory pressures in the U.K., including rules slashing the minimum wager on fixed-odds betting terminals from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, have hit the industry hard. But the U.S. boom could more than make up for it - if the gamble pays off.", "description": "U.K. betting giant Flutter has agreed to buy Canadian online gaming company The Stars Group, creating the world\u2019s largest online betting operator.", "authors": ["Callum Keown"], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-DG116_sports_SOC_20191002061318.jpg"}
