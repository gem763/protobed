Southgate's tactical mishap\n\nEngland might have raced into a commanding position in Group A \u2013 but the problems are piling up for boss Gareth Southgate who seemed to get his first half tactics all wrong.\n\nAfter a second half horror show in their last outing against Kosovo last month, England's midfield, featuring a first start for 20-year-old Mason Mount, was out-played and over-run as the Czech's gave Southgate's stars a first half lesson in fast-paced, clever football.\n\nJordan Henderson and Declan Rice had it all on top as Jaroslav Silhavy's stars ran amok at times while in defence England were a shambles at set-pieces and up front created almost nothing.\n\nAnd you can't help wondering that if a Czech Republic side ranked 44 in the world rankings can make England look ordinary \u2013 what will Europe's best do next summer?\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n2. Who will partner Maguire?\n\nHarry Maguire's nailed down his spot at the heart of England's defence \u2013 but the slot alongside him is up for grabs.\n\nAnd Everton's Michael Keane did nothing to suggest that, going forward, it'll be him partnering Maguire as England looked shaky at the back.\n\nHis confidence can hardly be high with Everton suffering a poor start to the Premier League season but Liverpool's Joe Gomez and injured Manchester City star John Stones have their problems too.\n\nEngland have now conceded 32 goals in 38 games under Gareth Southgate \u2013 hardly the meanest figures around.\n\nAnd they looked vulnerable every time the Czech Republic flooded forward in the Sinobo Stadium.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n3. England too reliant on Sterling's goals\n\nThere's no doubt Raheem Sterling is England's big danger man after scoring eight goals in his last nine games.\n\nBut are England becoming too reliant on the Manchester City star?\n\nGareth Southgate's stars weren't at their best in Prague and Sterling caught the bug too despite winning England a fourth minute penalty for Harry Kane.\n\nSterling had the chance to clinch victory second half as he ran in on a pass from Kane but keeper Tomas Vaclik was out rapidly to make a vital intervention.\n\nSterling, of course, kept going right to the end \u2013 but it wasn't his or England's night.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n4. Cool Kane delivers from the spot again\n\nWhen Harry Kane's on the spot he rarely lets England down \u2013 and it was just as well in Prague as he delivered again from 12 yards.\n\nThere have been few better penalty takers for England than Frank Lampard who held the Three Lions record with nine from the spot in his 106 caps.\n\nBut Kane, arguably England's best outfield player on the night, is poised to create a new benchmark after equalling Lampard's spot-kick haul.\n\nThe England skipper cheekily placed his penalty down the middle of Tomas Vaclik's goal as Raheem Sterling was pulled down by Czech Republic midfielder Lukas Masopust after just four minutes.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n5. Pickford dividing the nation\n\nJordan Pickford's got his critics who claim he's sometimes guilty of risky footwork or prone to an occasional lapse in concentration.\n\nPickford has only managed three clean sheets in 12 games for club and country this season - \u2013 but as a shot-stopper the Everton keeper can't be faulted.\n\nAnd he rescued England with several cracking saves to prevent the Czech's scoring more.\n\nHis superb one-handed save to deny Vladimir Coufal came just before the Czech's scored their ninth minute equaliser.\n\nThe 25-year-old Goodison star made another second half to tip over a powerful shot from Lukas Masopust and then denied Alex Kral as England's defence opened up again.\n\nBut he couldn't prevent Ondrasek grabbing an 85th minute winner for the vibrant Czechs.", "description": "England were not at their best in Prague and suffered for the poor performance by suffering defeat in Prague", "authors": ["Steve Bates", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563396.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Czech-Republic-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
