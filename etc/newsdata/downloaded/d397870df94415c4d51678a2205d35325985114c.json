REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nHuawei strengthened its dominance of the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market even as the Chinese company was all but banned by the United States in May from doing business with American companies, significantly disrupting its ability to source key parts.\n\nThe world\u2019s No. 2 maker of smartphones was granted a reprieve until November. Nevertheless, promotions and patriotic purchases have driven Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales in China, helping it more than offset a shipments slump in the global market.\n\nWhile the Chinese smartphone market still contracted by 3% in the third quarter compared to a year earlier, Huawei smartphones made up 41.5 million of the 97.8 million shipped in the period, according to data from market research firm Canalys.\n\n\u201cHuawei opened a huge gap between itself and other vendors,\u201d said Nicole Peng, Canalys vice president of mobility. \u201cIts dominant position gives Huawei a lot of power to negotiate with the supply chain and to increase its wallet share within channel partners.\u201d\n\nHuawei\u2019s growth came at the expense of main rivals Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Apple, which together accounted for 50% of the market in the third quarter, down from 64% a year earlier.\n\nThe third quarter sales also mark Apple\u2019s weakest quarter in China for five years, said Peng.\n\nHowever, she added that Apple received a boost from the launch of the iPhone 11 in September, with customers willing to wait two to three weeks to receive shipments of the newer models.\n\nHuawei said last week it had sold more than 200 million phones globally in 2019, 64 days earlier than in 2018.\n\nThe company\u2019s profits remain resilient despite pressure from the United States, with revenue jumping 27% in the third quarter.\n\nIts flagship Mate 30 Pro 4G version, which Huawei unveiled in September, was not a big factor in its Q3 success, Canalys said, with most people waiting for the 5G version to launch later this year.\n\n\u201cHuawei is in a strong position to consolidate its dominance further amid 5G network rollout, given its tight operator relationships in 5G network deployment, and control over key components such as local network compatible 5G chipsets compared with local peers,\u201d said Canalys\u2019 Peng.\n\n\u201cThis puts significant pressure on Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, which find it very hard to make any breakthrough.\u201d", "description": "Huawei Technologies lifted its share of China's smartphone market to a record 42%, with third-quarter shipments rising by two-thirds as domestic consumers rallied behind it after U.S. sanctions, data released on Wednesday showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446413005&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T05B", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
