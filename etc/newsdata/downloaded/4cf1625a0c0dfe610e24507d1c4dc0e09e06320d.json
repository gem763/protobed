Investors, however, might get a better sense of the size of the problem on Tuesday. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform is holding a hearing to discuss PFAS water contamination.\n\nThe back story. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are chemicals manufactured for years by 3M (ticker: MMM), among others, for use in such products as stain- and water-resistant fabrics and carpeting, as well as paint, until the early 2000s. The Environmental Protection Agency now says PFAS exposure can lead to \u201cadverse health outcomes.\u201d Recently, makers of PFAS chemicals have been setting aside money to clean up manufacturing sites. They are also facing some new product-liability lawsuits.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, 3M took a $235 million charge for PFAS remediation. Shares dropped 13% after the company reported first-quarter numbers. It wasn\u2019t all due to PFAS though. The company missed Wall Street earnings expectations and cut its full-year profit guidance.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. 3M representatives are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill and on Monday and issued a news release listing new PFAS actions, including money for research and remediation.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives are guided by 3M\u2019s long history of corporate responsibility and our commitment to sound science,\u201d said Dr. Rutherford, senior vice president of Corporate Affairs, in the company\u2019s news release. \u201cI look forward to sharing 3M\u2019s commitment and knowledge with the Subcommittee. We will continue to work with Congress and regulators to address PFAS concerns.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead. It will take more clarity on the PFAS issue to get the stock working again. Shares are down 13% year to date, worse than the 17% gain of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same span. Shares trade for 16.4 times estimated 2020 earnings, a discount to historical averages, but in line with other industrial stocks in the S&P 500.\n\n3M shares rose 1.2% to $165.94 on Monday, better than the 0.1% gain for the Dow.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Representatives of 3M are scheduled to testify on Tuesday at an environmental hearing on Capitol Hill.
