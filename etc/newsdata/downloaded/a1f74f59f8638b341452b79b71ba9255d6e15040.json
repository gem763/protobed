Ankara\u2019s purported aim is to create a \u2018safe zone\u2019 \u2013 32km deep and 480km long on the Syrian side of the border \u2013 so that it can relocate up to 2 million of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently residing in Turkey. But this is most likely a cover to flush Kurdish troops out of the area. Turkey views the Kurdish YPG militia in north-eastern Syria as a direct threat and brands them as terrorists associated with the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.\n\nBut the YPG aligned with the US was instrumental in defeating the Islamic State terrorists in Syria. However, on Sunday US President Donald Trump suddenly announced that he was pulling back American troops from Syria, most of whom were supporting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. This came after a telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan which was practically a green signal to Ankara to go ahead with its military offensive.\n\nSo we are looking at another round of strife in Syria. Plus, if the Kurds are forced to defend themselves against the invading Turkish forces, they will be pulled away from guarding detention centres in the region that house around 12,000 suspected Islamic State terrorists. And if the latter break free in the chaos, it could potentially lead to the resurgence of the Islamic State in Syria. Therefore, it needs to be asked who is Turkey helping here. Its actions certainly won\u2019t help eliminate the last remnants of the Islamic State terrorists in the region. It hasn\u2019t sought any permission from the Syrian government in launching its operation and therefore is in clear violation of international rules. Turkey today is an invading force in Syria and is impinging on Syrian territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nTo be honest, Turkey was never really bothered by Islamic State terrorists. A few years ago there were even reports that Turkey was buying oil from Daesh. On the other hand, Erdogan\u2019s anti-Kurd politics has worked for him. Therefore, attacking the Syrian Kurds shores up his status as a \u2018nationalist\u2019 and provides good distraction from domestic issues likes infirmities in the Turkish economy. Besides, if he can create an area of Turkish influence inside Syria then that would fit well with his grand vision of resurrecting the glory of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBut the Kurds aren\u2019t going to cut and run, and will definitely put up a fight. This is certain to heap more death and destruction on Syria, a country which has already seen much devastation due to the eight-year-long civil war. It\u2019s all very well for Trump to say that regional actors should figure out how to handle the situation. But given what has happened to Syria over much of this decade, the international community must prevent more bloodshed and destruction in that country. Pressure must be brought to bear on Turkey to halt its military offensive and pull back its troops from Syria.", "description": "In another explosive situation in Syria, Turkish military and allied Syrian rebels have launched a military operation in north-eastern Syria against Kurdish forces there.
