Don\u2019t even ask her whether she watches the Democratic presidential debates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not missing anything. I prefer happiness,\u201d Sinema declares in a 25-minute interview, a rare extended conversation with an outlet not based in Arizona. \u201cLook how happy I am.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cThey will not get my vote on [nuking the filibuster],\u201d Sinema said in her office, outfitted with shiny leather and translucent chairs and boasting a vivid shade of purple that pops from the walls. \u201cIn fact, whether I\u2019m in the majority or the minority I would always vote to reinstate the protections for the minority. \u2026 It is the right thing for the country.\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd observers watching her on the Senate floor during a vote would be forgiven for thinking she\u2019s a Republican, considering her chats with GOP senators like Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
