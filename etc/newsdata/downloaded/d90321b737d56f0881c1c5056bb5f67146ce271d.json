These two sectors will account for 75 per cent of its revenue this financial year.\n\nThe proceeds of the poultry sale (which requires approval by the unitholders of its lessee, National Stock Exchange-listed RFM Poultry) will be used to pay down debt and fund investments in \"natural resource predominant assets\" which RFM said had the potential for higher total returns.\n\nRural Funds will forego $11m in rent from the sale of the poultry sheds.\n\nThe first of these investments will be three WA cattle properties \u2013 Petro, High Hill and Willara north of Perth \u2013 which RFF has agreed to acquire from prominent pastoralist and businessman Brent Smoothy for $22.6 million. They will be leased to Wagyu beef producer Stone Axe Pastoral Company on 10-year terms. The acquisitions are expected to settle in April next year.\n\nIn light of these deals, which will remove about $11 million in annual poultry revenue, RFF cut its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) expectations in fiscal 2020 to 13.4\u00a2 per unit from the 14\u00a2 per unit forecast given at its full-year results announcement in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe forecast full-year distribution for fiscal 2020 was unchanged at 10.85\u00a2 per unit, but the payout ratio has increased to 81 per cent from 77 per cent.\n\nRFM acknowledged the transactions would \"marginally reduce AFFO in the short term\" but said they would \"deliver higher AFFO growth in the medium and long term\"\n\nInvestors appeared to support this view, with RFF units rising 2.5 per cent to $1.83 by late afternoon on Monday.\n\nRFF units were worth $2.35 prior to distribution of the first Bonitas report, which labelled RFF's equity \"ultimately worthless\".", "description": "Rural Funds Management managing director David Bryant says the sale of the poultry assets shows the agribusiness property trust has valued its assets correctly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d557089c2dc15b293b1b16f8b212ece2bcdb0afd", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
