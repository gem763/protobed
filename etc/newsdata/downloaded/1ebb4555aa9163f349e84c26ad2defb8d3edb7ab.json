Fans around the globe were attending launches on Monday and Tuesday to finally get their hands on a copy and discover the fate of Gilead, Atwood\u2019s vision of a theocratic future America.\n\nHow to get in touch\n\nCritics have lined up to give their reviews \u2013 including Anne Enright in the Guardian, who wrote: \u201cThe Testaments is Atwood at her best, in its mixture of generosity, insight and control. The prose is adroit, direct, beautifully turned. All over the reading world, the history books are being opened to the next blank page and Atwood\u2019s name is written at the top of it. To read this book is to feel the world turning, as the unforeseeable shifts of the last few years reveal the same old themes.\u201d\n\nBut we want to hear your reviews. Are you a long-time Atwood fan? Have you only discovered her since The Handmaid\u2019s Tale TV show?
