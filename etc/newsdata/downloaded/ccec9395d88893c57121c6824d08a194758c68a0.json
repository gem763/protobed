But can they work?", "language": "en", "text": "San Francisco and Los Angeles are moving forward with plans to create their own public banks following the passage of historic legislation that made California the second state in the continental US to legalize the financial institutions.\n\nExperts say their success and that of other California counties and cities with similar plans will depend on the governance structures they put in place and the financing they are able to secure.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Public Banking Act, signed on 2 October, paves the way for cities and counties in the state to create public banks that could take deposits and allow local agencies access to low-interest loans for funding infrastructure and affordable housing. The law requires public banks to be run by independent boards and to be operated by professional bankers in order to insulate against self-dealing.\n\nSupporters of the legislation see the bill as a way to divest from major financial institutions tied to controversial projects like the Dakota Access pipeline. And because public banks wouldn\u2019t be under the same pressure as Wall Street banks to seek ever-higher profit, they argue, they could allow government agencies access to low-interest loans for funding infrastructure or constructing affordable housing.\n\nCalifornia just legalized public banking, setting the stage for more affordable housing Read more\n\nState and local governments across the country currently hold $502bn in bank deposits and $4.3tn in state and local public pensions, according to Next City, with the vast majority of that held in private banks. Under the new law, more of that money would stay local.\n\nPublic banks aren\u2019t new to the US. American Samoa created its public bank in 2016 after financial institutions abandoned the island, shutting down access to loans. But the first public bank in the US, the Bank of North Dakota, grew out of a brief socialist movement 100 years ago.\n\nDavid Flynn, the economics and finance department chair at the University of North Dakota, said the North Dakota bank came from a desire to keep out-of-state financial institutions from inflating interest rates on loans to farmers and to keep control of local interests \u2013 a slight twist from the aim to \u201ckeep money local\u201d, as stated by those who championed the bill in California.\n\n\u201cI think on some level the Public Banking Act is a logical outgrowth of public opinion of where we\u2019ve seen financial institutions go in the last decade,\u201d Flynn said, referencing public reaction to Wall Street\u2019s role in the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota is working, fulfilling its charter to expand access to credit and promote agricultural enterprises in a way that\u2019s allowed the state economy to move forward in its own way, he added.\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota helped buoy the state\u2019s economy after 2008\u2019s financial collapse, Sushil Jacob, a senior attorney with the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area who helped draft the California bill, told the Guardian earlier this month\n\n\u201cThe state of North Dakota has six times as many financial institutions per capita as the rest of the country and it\u2019s because they have the Bank of North Dakota. When the great recession hit, the Bank of North Dakota stepped in and provided loans and allowed local banks to thrive,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nNorth Dakota, however, only has one public bank, whereas California will allow up to 10 cities or counties to create them. That has the potential to create conflict between institutions in cities and could put municipalities in competition over who has access to public banks, Flynn said.\n\nHe notes that California has done well to bake protections into the law, like the requirement for municipalities to create independent boards to oversee banks and the decision to initially cap the number of public banks at 10. But he said the overall success of public banks in California is hard to predict.\n\n\u201cCalifornia put in a good degree of protections. I think the question becomes how much independence will there be in practice, how much oversight there will be in practice, and you really won\u2019t know that until we see the people who are placed on boards and are able to gauge the effort as it\u2019s happening,\u201d Flynn said.\n\nJacob\u2019s organization is a founding member of the California Public Banking Alliance, a grassroots network of groups in cities that campaigned for the bill including San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles, where advocates are pushing to open California\u2019s first public bank.\n\nIn LA, public banks attracted early interest from some local lawmakers as a way to allow players in the cannabis industry to access banking services. Even though the state has legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use, the pot industry has been largely locked out of banks because the plant is illegal on a federal level.\n\nPublic banks, at least in California, may not be the answer those in the cannabis industry hope for. Because the state law requires public banks to obtain direct deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, it\u2019s unlikely the pot industry could benefit.\n\n\u201cUntil we see a change in federal law, we just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nAnother potential hurdle for the establishment of public banks is cost. A feasibility study published earlier this year by the San Francisco tax collector\u2019s office estimated costs for three different models of public banks \u2013 one that focuses on affordable housing and small business lending, a bank that handles the city\u2019s cash, and one that does both \u2013 to add up to $184m and $3.9bn just to get off the ground and take the banks between 10 and 56 years to grow large enough to break even.\n\nCritics of the study, including Jacob, say the estimated start up costs listed in the report were greatly exaggerated because authors didn\u2019t factor in ways that public banks could tap into already existing infrastructure and IT systems.\n\nBut costs are part of the reason the editorial board of the Los Angeles Times panned the idea back in May: \u201cFew public agencies have the budget for such huge upfront costs or the ability to wait decades for a bank to become self-sustaining. And public banks that have a mission of serving people who cannot qualify for commercial bank financing face greater risk of defaults, making it harder for them to sustain themselves,\u201d the board wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, San Francisco and Los Angeles are moving ahead. A task force will put together a business plan in San Francisco which Jacob hopes could be ready in 10 months. A public bank could take several years to create and open.", "description": "Public banks could allow government agencies access to low-interest loans for infrastructure or affordable housing", "authors": ["Mario Koran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db5f74e79d5fa8974972ed834ce3b07f941bb91/0_102_4254_2552/master/4254.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1505661f77af68795f3138b150b61b51", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
