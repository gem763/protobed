And if you\u2019re a parent of a teenager or 20-something, you\u2019ve probably lived them. (A recent Bloomberg Businessweek report said some recent college grads have so much debt and are chipping away at it so slowly, some won\u2019t escape it until they\u2019re dead.) But Caitlin Zaloom, author of the disturbing new book, \u201cIndebted: How Families Make College Work at Any Cost,\u201d says student debt isn\u2019t just taking a financial toll on parents and young adults. She says it\u2019s taking an emotional toll, too.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, this emotional part is at the heart of it,\u201d Zaloom, an associate professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University, told me. \u201cParents want their children to do well and they\u2019re often silent about their own financial situations in order to try to create a situation for their children to go off into their lives without the burden of the parents\u2019 compromised finances.\u201d\n\nThe anxiety that student loans impose on families\n\nSo, she added, \u201ceducation imposes anxiety on families at the same time it\u2019s supposed to be increasing independence and freedom of young adults.\u201d\n\nZaloom, an economic anthropologist and mother of two youngsters, came to that conclusion after conducting 160 interviews with middle-class parents and their children who were college students or recent grads.\n\n\u201cOur loan-repayment system is shockingly punishing.\u201d Caitlin Zaloom, author of \u201cIndebted: How Families Make College Work at Any Cost\u201d\n\nZaloom\u2019s research for \u201cIndebted\u201d also led her to believe that there are major problems in what she calls the \u201cstudent finance complex\u201d \u2014 the financial aid system run by the U.S. government, colleges and financial institutions. Zaloom has a few ideas on how to change the system to help families deal with paying for what is often the second biggest expense of their lives: college.\n\nHighlights from my conversation with Caitlin Zaloom:\n\nNext Avenue: What made you interested in researching college costs and the effect on families?\n\nCaitlin Zaloom: My students brought it to me. One day I got a knock on my door and saw one of my favorite students in tears. She said she was about to graduate with tens of thousands of dollars in debt and was offered a job to help pay back the student loans, but she said it undermined what she saw herself doing.\n\nIt became clear to me that the most important research project I could do concerned the lives of my students. I hadn\u2019t seen anything that had looked at how families were responding to the pressures the high cost of college placed on them and on their relationships. I wanted to do a study to help get inside what that experience was like.\n\nAnd I wanted to look at the middle class, since they are the ones who have to rely on loans to make it work. They make too much to get government grants and don\u2019t have enough to pay tuition in cash. So, they\u2019re thrust into the student finance complex.\n\nWhat would you say is the chief conclusion you came to after talking to all those parents and their kids, and researching the financial aid system?\n\nThe main takeaway, I\u2019d say, is that middle-class life is largely organized around this problem of paying for college. It enters into parents\u2019 minds early on, sometimes when the kids are less than a year old. And it organizes their financial goals. Parents want their children to do well and today, more than ever, college is essential to achieving that goal.\n\nYou say that the college aid system has introduced difficult moral conflicts for parents. How?\n\nFamilies today get conflicting messages. On the one hand, they\u2019re told they have to evaluate whether a college their child wants to go to is worth the money and that they should be able to meet the cost of education entirely on their own, through income and savings; and if that doesn\u2019t cut it, then with loans. On the other hand, they\u2019re told that as parents they should do everything they can to support their children and open up opportunities for them, and that means spending money. So that means putting their children first, before their own lives, regardless of cost.\n\nSo they\u2019re being told to economize, and also that the message of parenting is to spend money on their children. That\u2019s a conflict that every middle-class parent I spoke with feels.\n\nAnd you say middle class families are encouraged, if not required, to engage in social speculation. What\u2019s that?\n\nI mean that parents and students are being asked to put down a lot of money on the idea that it will pay off sometime in the future. But they don\u2019t know how it will pay off and can\u2019t see what the future looks like. For the parents, it means putting down money now and drawing from it often \u2014 funds that might otherwise go to their retirement. So it\u2019s creating incredible uncertainty for the parents\u2019 futures.\n\nHow has the college financing system changed to get to this point?\n\nThere was a significant change in political philosophy in the 1980s when Reagan\u2019s budget director David Stockman said that if people want to go to college, it was their responsibility to pay for it. From that moment on, college costs began to rise and loans became more available and prevalent.\n\nSo, in the 1980s and \u201990s, higher education began to be considered to be a private benefit and an asset, like a mortgage. That political philosophy has gotten us into the mess we\u2019re in now.\n\nOne big thorn in the system is the Expected Family Contribution amount for financial aid. Can you explain what that is and the problems families have with it?\n\nIt\u2019s the cornerstone of the financial aid system. The idea is that the federal government calculates how much the family can afford to pay for college. But it does that through a formula that many families believe to be unrealistic.\n\nFor instance, if there\u2019s a grandparent who relies on the family\u2019s assistance, that responsibility is not part of the calculation.\n\nRead: 4 colleges where you can work for your tuition\n\nThe government draws a tight circle around the nuclear family and not how many Americans live today. Families I interviewed often thought they were being asked to pay far more than their budgets could afford.\n\nFor divorced families, there can be very big trouble because parents need to communicate with each other about money in order to fill out the forms.\n\nYou\u2019re not against student loans altogether. You just say that the current system does far more harm than necessary and introduces too many difficult tensions into family life. What do you mean?\n\nOur loan-repayment system is shockingly punishing. The interest rate is high, and we ask graduates to pay back the loans in the most vulnerable decade of their lives. There\u2019s a very high default rate on student loans.\n\nYou found that the parents and kids you interviewed hadn\u2019t talked together very much about the cost of college and the family\u2019s ability to pay for certain schools. You call this \u2018nested silences.\u2019\n\nWe know that American families don\u2019t like to talk to outsiders about their money. But there\u2019s also a real divide between the generations; parents don\u2019t like to talk to their children about money either. That silence can mask the parents\u2019 shame of not making enough money or as much money as they would have expected. It might mask the other debt that parents carry.\n\nYou wrote about an Obama administration change in college aid that inadvertently made it more difficult for many black parents to qualify for PLUS loans. Can you explain why, and what the effect was?\n\nPLUS loans are loans from the federal government available to parents, up to the cost of attendance. We know that African-Americans have been systematically underpaid and denied access to the kind of wealth-building strategies of white Americans, which has compromised their credit scores. That\u2019s made it difficult for them to access loans from private lenders, so they\u2019ve been more likely to take these PLUS loans.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: These 3 colleges have new ideas to help reduce student loans\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the Department of Education abruptly changed the formula for parents and that inadvertently ended up throwing hundreds of thousands of students against the ropes. When the rules changed, it meant families with worse credit than others were ejected from the program, even those who had qualified the year before.\n\nAnd the Obama administration also fixed this problem?\n\nThey changed the rules and tried to ameliorate the problem, but they didn\u2019t go back to the way the rules were before.\n\nCan you talk about one or two of the families you spoke to and your takeaways from them?\n\nOne important point [from my research] is that even families who look like they\u2019re in great shape financially often have much more complicated financial histories than you\u2019d think. And that makes paying for college harder than it might appear on the surface.\n\nRead next: Where the 2020 candidates stand on student debt and college affordability\n\nThe Kaminsky family [a pseudonym to protect their privacy], for a long time had careers where they didn\u2019t have the kind of stability they have today. And the parents had responsibilities for taking care of the grandparents; that didn\u2019t show up on their application for federal student aid. The cost of sending their boys to college really drained their savings and took a huge bite out of their budget.\n\nAt the end of the book you say it\u2019s time to negotiate the terms for government programs and the student finance complex. You say we need a new system that supports families and creates more opportunity. How could that be done?\n\nWe need to fund the public higher education system so it\u2019s free or has very low-cost tuition, to alleviate the pressure on families to raise and launch their kids. We haven\u2019t really done that. For the last several decades, state legislatures have been slashing budgets for public colleges and universities.\n\nWe have student-loan repayment programs that are tied to the borrower\u2019s income after graduating. What\u2019s wrong with them?\n\nAll of the government\u2019s repayment programs are really a mess. They are very complicated and confusing. For instance, very few graduates are able to enter the public-service loan-forgiveness program successfully and repay the loans.\n\nYou and your husband have two children who are five and eight years away from college. How has your research affected the way you\u2019re paying for college?\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question. As you might imagine, I spend a lot of time thinking about money. We had our system set up already, but there\u2019s one commonality between our situation and the families I spoke with: It will take multiple generations to send our kids to college. We are lucky to have grandparents who are willing and able to contribute.
