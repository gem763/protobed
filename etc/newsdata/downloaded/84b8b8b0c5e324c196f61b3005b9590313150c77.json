Yesterday Salvini took the reins and I understand the discomfort of the managers and rank-and-file of Forza Italia.\"\n\n\"To whomever believes that there is space for a liberal, democratic area, I say, come give us a hand,\" he said.\n\nA Berlusconi loyalist, Mara Carfagna, quickly rejected the proposal saying, \"we are not in search of new landing sites or new leaders.\"\n\n\"Renzi's clear hope is that Forza Italia implodes,\" Carfagna said, adding that she is working to maintain the movement's identity as \"moderate, liberal and reformist, with its feet planted in the center-right, with no hints of sovereign-ism or extremism.\"\n\nRenzi split from the Democratic Party that he formerly ran after supporting the formation of the new government with the 5-Star Movement to create his own \"Italia Viva\" party. Polls show its support hovering at around 5%, with three-quarters of Italians viewing it as a marginal party, and only 10% believe it will rise to significance.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
