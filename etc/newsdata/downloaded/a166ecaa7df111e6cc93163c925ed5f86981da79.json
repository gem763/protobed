One of the debate's key topics was gun control.\n\nChief Art Acevedo asked for prayers for the unidentified 29-year-old officer, who he said was in guarded condition. He said one of the suspects was shot and killed in the exchange of fire, two other men were in custody and police were searching for the fourth.\n\nAcevedo said the chaotic evening of violence began about 9:56 p.m. Thursday with the carjacking, but the vehicle soon ran out of gas and the suspects fled.\n\nPolice believe the men then assaulted a priest and stole his cell phone. The firefight took place about 15 minutes later. At least one officer, potentially two, exchanged gunfire with the armed suspect. He was shot and killed, Fox 26 reported.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe wounded police officer is a five-year veteran on the force.
