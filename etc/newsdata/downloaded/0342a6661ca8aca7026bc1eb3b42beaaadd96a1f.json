Importance? Significance? When the Nationals come back to host games 3 and 4, and possibly Game 5, it will be something unprecedented that fans here will witness.\n\nNo, the Capitals\u2019 Stanley Cup doesn\u2019t measure up. No, the Bullets 1978 NBA championship isn\u2019t comparable.\n\nHouston, though \u2014 well, they\u2019ve seen this before. It may be a cow town, but this is the Astros\u2019 third time hosting World Series games \u2014 with Game 1 Tuesday night and Game 2 Wednesday.\n\nThey\u2019ve done this as recently as 2017, winning that World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games. They know how to prepare.\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch was asked to compare those two Astros teams.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re different years, different teams,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a few different players. We\u2019re a little bit more mature, the guys that are here. But I haven\u2019t given a lot of thought to try to historically compare them. They\u2019re both really good teams. We both have gotten to the World Series; one\u2019s got a ring, one doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing for Nationals manager Dave Martinez and his team to compare it to. They have no team road map on how to get ready for the World Series. But they did their best, after sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in four games in the National League Championship Series and then having a five-day layoff before working out here at Minute Maid Park, to figure out how to get ready.\n\nOne of the ways they did so was to play a simulated game in the rain Sunday at Nationals Park.\n\n\u201cThe weather was miserable and we had a scheduled workout,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we were going to do anything, but the boys came out and practiced in the rain. We had a sim (simulated) game in the rain. It was cold, but they were all into it. (Anibal) Sanchez threw, a couple of our bullpen guys threw the hitters, we had a good time. They\u2019re all in. They\u2019re ready. These guys are excited to be here, and let\u2019s go have some fun.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s that \u201cfun\u201d word again. It\u2019s Martinez\u2019s go-to word, the word he used to relieve the pressure during the season when his team came back from a 19-31 start to make the wild card and finish with a 93-69 regular season record.\n\nThat is what has worked to date for Martinez and his boys \u2014 making a point of having fun, from dancing in the dugout to Gerardo Parra and the Baby Shark phenomenon.\n\nSomehow I don\u2019t think the Astros will be impressed with any of that. I think they look at this as serious business \u2014 though they have had their share of fun, the most recent celebrating Jose Altuve\u2019s walkoff series-clinching home run in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series to defeat the Yankees.\n\nHinch\u2019s word was \u201cmature.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals are doing all they can to ride the emotional wave that got them here. Martinez believes that despite the time that has passed since they celebrated their NLCS victory nearly a week ago, they are still in their wild-card frame of mind \u2014 go 1-0, win the next game.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that these guys are fired up to be here,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe played a lot of unbelievable games this year. We\u2019ve come a long way.\n\nThe Nationals will count on their emotional leader, Max Scherzer, to take the ball Tuesday night in Game 1 against Houston ace Gerrit Cole. They have tried to have fun for the last week to get ready for the biggest sporting event Washington has seen in nearly a century.\n\nThe Astros are trying to win their second World Series in three years. Nobody uses the word \u201cfun\u201d much on that side of the field.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
