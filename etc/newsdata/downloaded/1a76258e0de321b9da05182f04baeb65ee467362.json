The data brought year-to-date inflation to 3.0%, which was\n\nwell within the central bank's 2%-4% target for the year.\n\nCore inflation PHCPXY=ECI , which strips out volatile food\n\nand fuel items, edged down to 2.9% in August from 3.2% in July.\n\nFood and non-alcoholic beverages, which make up nearly\n\ntwo-fifths of the overall basket used to calculate inflation,\n\nrose at a slower annual pace of 0.6% compared with 1.9% in July.\n\nPrice rises for housing, water, electricity, gas, and other\n\nfuel also eased to 1.8% from the previous month's 2.2%.\n\nSlowing inflation allowed the central bank to cut rates\n\ntwice by a total of 50 basis points in May and August to give\n\nthe economy a lift and buffer it from the fallout from the\n\nU.S.-China trade war.\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno has\n\nflagged a further quarter-point interest rate reduction before\n\nthe end of 2019 to shore up economic growth, which slipped to\n\nits weakest in 17 quarters in April-June. \u201cWe expect the governor to deliver on his pledge and cut\n\npolicy rates by an additional 25 basis points at the 26\n\nSeptember meeting,\u201d said ING economist Nicholas Mapa.\n\nIn a mobile phone text message, Diokno said the latest\n\ninflation reading \"is excellent news indeed. This gives us more\n\nconfidence that average inflation would be in the neighbourhood\n\nof 2% in Q3 before it would increase slightly in Q4.\"\n\nBSP raised the rates by a total of 175 basis points last\n\nyear to rein in inflation, which peaked at a near-decade high of\n\n6.7% in September and October.\n\nInflation is seen to average 2.6% this year and 2.9% next\n\nyear, the central bank has said, well within its target of 2%-4%\n\nfor both years.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 1 -Philippines inflation slows to near 3-yr low in August", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_5_800x533_L_1412601619.jpg"}
