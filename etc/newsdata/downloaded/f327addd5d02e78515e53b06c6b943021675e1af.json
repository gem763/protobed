At least 50 per cent of the book was covered by retail, he told one person.\n\nAs it turned out, those close to the deal say there was barely any demand from either local investors or those offshore.\n\nAnd in recent meetings with domestic fund managers, he was so keen to talk down buy-now, pay-later juggernaut Afterpay in his bid to promote Latitude that there's a view attendees simply tuned out.\n\nAfter all, many of those he was presenting to have large holdings in Afterpay and have made signficant returns on the investment.\n\nAhmed Fahour and John Stanhope appeared before Senate Estimates in early 2017 to explain high salaries at the government-owned company. Andrew Meares\n\nRegardless of the real reasons behind the float's failure, Fahour is shaping up as the main scapegoat in the failed IPO, which the market is now gleefully dissecting.\n\n\"It's probably beyond the usual Australian tall poppy syndrome ... it didn't help what he was getting paid was incorrectly characterised,\" says one person, referring to the $22.5 million in bonus shares that Fahour was set to receive if the float priced at the top end of the range, a \"ridiculous multiple\".\n\n\"He's a good operator ... he's certainly got the right attitude and he doesn't lack any confidence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother person involved in the deal was less flattering, suggesting that brokers should have perhaps kept him on a tighter leash in front of investors.\n\nSalary records\n\nFor all the fantastic stories about Fahour \u2013 which include an Australia Post client trip to the London Olympics, complete with business-class airfares and five-star hotels \u2013 a key question remains: is he really any good as an executive?\n\nMore specifically, is he as good at running companies as he is negotiating his own salary packages?\n\nTo the last point, perhaps not. Fahour has successfully set multiple records for pay in at least three high-profile roles, and each time, faced a public backlash.\n\nIn 2004, the then 37-year-old joined NAB as the Australian chief executive with a first-year package worth $18.8 million. His salary was publicly and roundly criticised by former NAB chief executive Nobby Clark at the bank's 2005 annual meeting, forcing then chairman Graham Kraehe to release a statement the following day defending it.\n\nIn 2016, as Australia Post boss, Fahour again set a salary record. This time, he became the country's most highly paid pulic servant by taking home a $5.6 million salary package, including a $1.2 million bonus, sparking criticism from then prime minster Malcolm Turnbull and triggering his resignation.\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed his pay for the final year running the group would be $10.79 million.\n\nHe genuinely believes he's worth the value he demands. \u2014 John Stanhope, Australia Post chairman\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost recently, he's made headlines \u2013 and upset some potential Latitude investors \u2013 with the bonus he negotiated.\n\n\"It was interesting what he stood to make through the IPO was about the same as the three underwriters on the float,\" says Merlon Capital Partners' Hamish Carlisle.\n\n\"Whether you regard his role as an agent of the shareholders to sell the business or run the business for new shareholders became quite blurred with the context of the financial alignment.\"\n\nNot everyone is put off by the fat bonuses.\n\nRegal Fund Management's Phil King this week said he expected him to do a \"great job\" as Latitude chief executive, adding his fund would have bought Latitude at $1.78 a share had the float got up.\n\nAustralia Post chairman John Stanhope, who didn't hire Fahour, says he is very good at his job. But Fahour is also very good at selling himself, he says.\n\n\"Part of Ahmed's background and capability is that he's pretty much a good sales guy, and he sells himself very well ... he genuinly believes he's worth the value he demands.\n\n\"The open question is [whether he is] worth what he'd like to be paid? At the end of the day, the people who decide to employ him have to make that judgement.\"\n\nBig jobs\n\nWhile Fahour has negotiated some eye-popping salaries, he's had plenty of other less headline-grabbing roles along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter NAB, he lasted about a year as the chief executive of Gulf Finance House in Bahrain. Before that, there was his chief executive role at the ill-fated Rudd Bank in 2009.\n\nHe's also had directorships at two of Melbourne's most blue-blooded of institutions: Methodist Ladies' College, where he was involved in the controversial sacking of principal Rosa Storelli, and the Carlton Football Club board, where he was constantly touted as a potential president.\n\nHe's also been on the board of Rip Curl and Raffy Geminder's Pro-Pac Packaging Group. More recently, he's acted as patron and major donor to the Islamic Museum of Australia, run by his brother Moustafa.\n\nBut salary isn't the only, or even the most reliable, measure of success.\n\nIt's always hard to judge the performance of an executive, particularly one in a private company. And Fahour has never headed a publicly listed company, with the exception of a stint as executive chairman at Pro-Pac. Between 2014 and 2019, the company's share price was largely flat until it collapsed in late 2018.\n\nAt NAB, he ultimately didn't make the cut. Chairman Michael Chaney appointed Cameron Clyne for the top job over Fahour, who suggested to some people he was the red-hot favourite.\n\n\"He's very good and he does work hard and delivers the low-hanging fruit,\" says one person who has followed his career closely. \"But he doesn't really have the strategic edge.\n\n\"The number one focus is on him and the pay packet.\"\n\nAnother banking analyst points out NAB has consistently maintained market share and a No.1 position in business and small and medium enterprise banking, and continued to do so under his watch. In other words, he didn't blow it up, but nor did he implement anything particularly memorable.\n\nFahour's supporters say missing out on the NAB top job is less a reflection on his executive capabilities and more a case of the bank taking the conservative option. His detractors say Chaney finally saw that he didn't measure up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralia Post legacy\n\nWhile Australia Post chief executive, Fahour told AFR BOSS magazine: \"To lead an organisation at any particular time I believe a board needs to pick somebody whose style and approach suits their needs at that moment.\n\n\"There are times when you are appropriate for something, or I am appropriate for something, and we will all be picked, selected or asked when there is a perfect match between what you are good at and what the organisation needs.\"\n\nOpinion is similarly divided about Fahour's time at Australia Post.\n\nOn the one hand, he's praised for wrangling the unions. On the other, he's criticised for failing to solve the real problem: how to reposition a business in a structurally challenged industry.\n\nThat's a criticism Stanhope rejects, saying that Fahour's implementation contained what could have been far larger losses for the mail division.\n\nIt's even harder to measure his performance at Latitude, where he has headed the company for about a year. He has, notably, brought in a few of his key Australia Post executives, including Chris Blake and Andrew Walduck.\n\nIn between his high-profile appointments, Fahour has also gathered a reputation as the person in the running for lots of jobs.\n\nMedia reports surfaced that he was in the running to replace Commonwealth Bank chief Ian Narev, although that never eventuated.\n\nAhead of Amazon's entry into Australia, Fahour is said to have kicked off meetings with people by saying: \"Obviously, I won't be able to talk about the speculation that I will be running Amazon locally.\"\n\nMore recently, he was mentioned as a possible NAB chief executive.\n\nNow, following the failed IPO, some are saying he's unemployable. Then again, they said that after NAB and Australia Post as well.\n\n\"Whether he sticks around is the big question now,\" says Merlon's Carlisle. \"Whether he was there [at Latitude] as an agent alongside the underwriters to sell the business, or whether he was there because of his skills as a CEO will ultimately be answered when we see if he is there in a year or so.\"\n\nWill this be Fahour's reckoning? His track record suggests he will be just fine.", "description": "Even before the Latitutde float failed on Wednesday, Ahmed Fahour was an executive people loved to hate.
