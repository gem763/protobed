Minkah Fitzpatrick forced a trade this week. Jalen Ramsey requested one, then accused the Jacksonville Jaguars of leaking the news. Jamal Adams appears ready for a stare-down, and Melvin Gordon continues to hold out. So much drama, so little actual football.\n\nAt the start of this crazy season, the players\u2019 motto should be: If you\u2019re not defying, you\u2019re not trying. Resistance is a trend now. And even though the shenanigans of Antonio Brown have dominated attention, superstar veterans aren\u2019t leading this movement. The Trent Williams saga is the only other contentious situation involving a veteran with more than five years of service. Mostly, this uprising is about young stars trapped in rookie contracts testing the limits and flexing for control.\n\nIt\u2019s about the money, sure. Ramsey didn\u2019t arrive a training camp in July in a fake Brinks truck because he wished for an early Halloween. But freedom of choice matters just as much as these players challenge a system that restricts both the opportunity to maximize their worth and the flexibility to reach true free agency in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nEight years ago, to end an ugly 132-day lockout, the owners and players finally reached a deal on a collective bargaining agreement that included a rookie wage scale. No more Sam Bradford receiving $50 million guaranteed before taking an NFL snap. No more ridiculously long training camp holdouts for rookies. No more fear that a high draft pick actually could complicate a rebuilding effort.\n\n[The NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive]\n\nThere was little opposition, in theory, to this change. Owners hated paying so much money for unproven talent. Veteran players hated rookies hogging money that could be redirected to them. Fans hated it, too, because complaining about the salaries of athletes, young or old, is an underrated pastime.\n\nBut over the past eight years, it has become clear that the owners scored a major victory with the rookie wage scale.\n\nUnder a wage-scale system that locked its emerging players into long contracts \u2014 first-round picks sign five-year deals, the final season being a team option; after the first round, players are given four-year deals \u2014 players who reach elite status quickly can be underpaid by tens of millions of dollars. The change represents a stunning overcorrection, and that\u2019s why Ezekiel Elliott held out despite having two years left on his rookie deal. That\u2019s why Gordon is staying away from the Los Angeles Chargers. That\u2019s why Jadeveon Clowney refused to sign the franchise tender until he was traded from Houston to Seattle. In 2018, Le\u2019Veon Bell sat out the 2018 season partly in protest of this system, and it led Khalil Mack to be traded from Oakland to Chicago. And while Ramsey is a complicated and mercurial cornerback who had a nasty sideline confrontation with Coach Doug Marrone on Sunday, compensation is at the core of his discontent.\n\nTypically, major contract disputes in professional sports are reserved for more established players. Now, players enter the NFL feeling like they need to hurry up and get theirs.\n\nTo illustrate the dramatic change, in the last year of the old system, Bradford signed a six-year, $86 million ($50 mil in guarantees) after being selected No. 1 overall in the 2010 draft. He wound up receiving about $78 million of that contract despite playing in just 63 of 96 games and tearing the ACL in his left knee twice.\n\nCam Newton was chosen first in 2011. After the lockout, under the new CBA, he was eligible for a four-year, $22-million deal. Including his fifth-year option, he made a little less than $37 million in his first contract.During that deal, Newton led the Carolina Panthers to three playoff appearances, won an MVP and went to a Super Bowl. As an almost immediate franchise player, he was a steal.\n\n[Lamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you]\n\nAlthough Newton received a monster second contract, he\u2019s also now struggling with injuries at age 30, which could shorten the back end of his career. It\u2019s possible his career might be described thusly, at least in terms of earning: underpaid, properly paid, compensation potential diminished because of injury. You will look at his earnings and mock him with a boo-hoo. And, yes, Newton understands the violent and fleeting nature of his profession.\n\nBut when you get past the sticker shock and focus strictly on salary as it relates to performance and the franchise\u2019s revenue, there is a fundamental unfairness to the rookie wage scale as it relates to NFL business. And Newton is a player who has had it quite good compared to a running back such as Gordon. He is holding out for one decent payday in a league that would rather use up a running back and toss him aside. It\u2019s especially cruel for a first-round tailback to have to pay on a five-year contract when his mileage is scrutinized all while his productivity is appreciated.\n\nThe owners and players are at work on a new collective bargaining because the current deal expires after next season. But when I asked multiple players involved with the union about the issues with the rookie wage scale, they acknowledged the problem. A few of them even alluded to frustration they felt when they had outperformed their deals. But none of them anticipated fixing that system would be a major point of negotiation. Naturally, older players lead the union, and this is a blind spot for them.\n\nIn a league with 1,696 players on the active roster, there are too many issues to consider, and the kids have to wait in line. It\u2019s so hard for the players to get a CBA universally praised as favorable because they\u2019re fighting for so much, and they\u2019re going against a streamlined group of 32 owners who don\u2019t budge on anything.\n\n[Analysis: Eli Manning would lower the standard for Hall of Fame quarterbacks]\n\nSo unhappy standouts on rookie deals are left to take matters in their own hands. They see what NBA players are doing. They\u2019re trying to follow the example, albeit in a vastly different league.\n\nThey want their money, or they want to go elsewhere. To an NFL team, their contracts are so reasonable that trade partners will surrender major assets to receive inexpensive elite players. In that sense, the trade market often seems like a solution for all parties.\n\nThe problem, though: Is there such a thing as a good deal when you\u2019re trading Ramsey, who is the best corner in the game at age 24?\n\nJacksonville can move on from Ramsey, the trash-talking headache, because his deal makes him so moveable. The Jaguars can\u2019t move on from Ramsey, the generational talent, without feeling like it left a lot of good football on the table.\n\nFairness in the era of the rookie-wage scale: Initial shared joy, mutual discontent, premature farewell. It\u2019s just another way that NFL stands for Not For Long.\n\nThis time, at least the players have some sway. They\u2019re going to keep pushing the boundaries, too.
