And He Wants Your Vote.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI\u2019m running as a Republican because I am a Republican,\u201d says Robb Ryerse in the short documentary True Believer. Confusion, though, is understandable\u2014Ryerse, who ran for the Republican House seat in Arkansas\u2019s Third Congressional District last year, isn\u2019t his party\u2019s boilerplate candidate. His beliefs could be perceived as dichotomous: He\u2019s an evangelical Christian who supports gay rights. He believes in small government, but is an advocate of Medicare for All. He\u2019s anti-abortion, but pro\u2013tax reform and green energy. He is, in short, a progressive Republican.\n\nTrue Believer, directed and produced by Josh Gleason and Sarah Colt, premieres on The Atlantic today. The film chronicles Ryerse\u2019s campaign in the 2018 midterm elections to unseat the Republican incumbent, Steve Womack, whom Ryerse describes as an \u201cestablishment type.\u201d Ryerse, who was a pastor for 20 years, hopes that his views will resonate with Republican voters who are disillusioned with Donald Trump.\n\nGleason told me that following Ryerse\u2019s campaign opened his eyes to a burgeoning movement of progressive evangelicals who are animated by issues such as the refugee crisis, income inequality, health care, and LGBTQ rights. \u201cEvangelicals are often depicted as monolithic, but there are many young evangelicals who care deeply about issues not typically associated with the movement,\u201d Gleason said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough of [these voters] in Robb\u2019s district to lift him to victory in the primary, but it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re out there\u2014and they feel politically homeless.\u201d\n\nThe film follows Ryerse from public appearances to the private realm, where he reckons with his unconventional messaging in intimate conversations with his wife. In one scene, the candidate engages in a debate about Confederate public monuments with a potential constituent. The exchange foregrounds Ryerse\u2019s commitment to inclusivity, and his ability to listen to and level with the concerns of voters.\n\n\u201cRobb\u2019s refusal to accept black-and-white partisan thinking was one of the core reasons we decided to follow his campaign,\u201d Colt told me. \u201cSo many Americans take for granted that if you identify as a Republican or a Democrat, you subscribe to an immobile set of core policy positions. From the start, Robb was unafraid to challenge these assumptions\u2014even though it made spreading his message far more difficult for his campaign.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Ryerse garnered only a fraction of the incumbent\u2019s votes. But his failure to secure a seat in the House has not quelled his ambitions. He is now the executive director of Brand New Congress, the group that originally recruited him to run for office. He also serves as the political director of Vote Common Good, which mobilizes religious voters in support of progressive candidates.", "description": "In the 2018 midterm elections, Robb Ryerse ran for Congress on a platform that rejected Trumpism.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/09/True_Believer_Site/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
