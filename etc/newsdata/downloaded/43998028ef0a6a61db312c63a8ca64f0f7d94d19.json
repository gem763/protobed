There\u2019s not a lot of him, he seems to have a short sprint at Sha Tin so the shorter straight at Happy Valley might be able to assist him,\u201d Purton said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he had the speed for a 1,200m race at Happy Valley and the way he battles on over 1,400m, I thought 1,650m was the more suitable distance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we\u2019ve come up with such a bad gate because it\u2019s going to force my hand to do one of two things, either go forward or go back, so I\u2019m just going to have to work that out.\n\n\u201cI was hoping that I could draw a low gate and just save him the first half of the race and that way he could hopefully run a strong race for us, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s up to it still.\u201d\n\n.@zpurton pockets a double as the Caspar Fownes-trained Aurora Pegasus breaks his duck at start 4 in Race 4. #HKracing #HappyWednesday pic.twitter.com/7g0xryxJml \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 9, 2019\n\nAlso among Purton\u2019s seven-strong book on Wednesday night is Caspar Fownes\u2019 last-start winner Aurora Pegasus and the consistent Chefano.\n\nPurton was aboard when Chefano finished second at the Valley in his first-up run this season and couldn\u2019t be happier with the horse upon it\u2019s return to the city track after a last-start fourth at Sha Tin under Blake Shinn.\n\n\u201cThe horse looks terrific, feels terrific in the mornings. He\u2019s going really, really well,\u201d Purton said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good frame of mind.\n\n\u201cI just worry that he may be a little bit of a better horse at Sha Tin than he is at Happy Valley. It seems like the long straight at Sha Tin has assisted him but if they go a good gallop and I can get into it from back in the field, that\u2019s going to help me.\u201d", "description": "Most Hong Kong jockeys would be thrilled with four wins from five meetings but for reigning champion Zac Purton, it\u2019s different terrain to that he has scaled in recent seasons....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/29/15d8bc58-fa17-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_162341.JPG?itok=ZzBu3wOM&v=1572337429", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
