Don\u2019t let the elephant see it. After Parliament wrested control of the agenda away from PM Boris Johnson and Tories expelled 21 of its MPs, Johnson demanded a snap election on October 15th and dared Jeremy Corbyn to agree to it:\n\nJohnson cast the rebellion as an attempt to surrender to the EU, vowed never to delay Brexit beyond Oct. 31 and challenged opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree to an Oct. 15 election. \u201cCan I invite the leader of the opposition to confirm, when he stands up shortly, that if that surrender bill is passed, he will allow the people of this country to have their view on what he is proposing to hand over in their name with an election on October the 15th,\u201d Johnson told parliament. However, needing the backing of two-thirds of lawmakers, Johnson\u2019s bid for an election is set to be initially thwarted as opposition parties are united in wanting to prevent a no-deal Brexit before agreeing to a vote.\n\nCorbyn, however, appeared to have taken Tony Blair\u2019s advice \u2014 or, perhaps, Johnson\u2019s nemesis instinctually decided to thwart what Johnson so clearly wanted. Corbyn declared that Parliament would take care of its own business first before deciding on elections, leaving Johnson sputtering schoolyard taunts at the Labour leader:\n\nA \u201cchlorinated chicken\u201d and a \u201cbig girl\u2019s blouse\u201d \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson kicked off his first questions in parliament by goading opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for not backing a new general election. \u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken that I can see \u2026 and he\u2019s on that bench,\u201d Johnson said, pointing at Corbyn who has criticised the British leader\u2019s enthusiasm for a trade deal with the United States over, among other things, concerns over food standards. He also appeared to shout at Corbyn that he was a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d \u2013 a coward \u2013 over his decision to back an election only when a no-deal Brexit was off the agenda.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a taunt from a party leader who just expelled nearly two dozen Conservative MPs for doing to him what, er, he did to Theresa May. It may be a bluff, too, considering that the Tories now have to run new candidates in those constituencies just to get back to a bare majority in the Parliament in the next elections. Kicking out Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson is nothing if not commitment to that bluff.\n\nJohnson insists that he can win because he will get the EU to break its vow not to renegotiate an exit agreement, and especially to abandon its commitment to the Irish border backstop:\n\nJohnson said his strategy was to get a Brexit deal by an EU summit on Oct. 17 and \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He said the British government was making substantial progress and would succeed in removing the Irish border backstop.\n\nThe election may not be Johnson\u2019s only bluff. Ireland\u2019s foreign minister later said that Johnson hasn\u2019t proposed anything to replace the backstop, at least not yet:\n\nSimon Coveney reiterated that as Johnson was advocating the removal of the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement aimed at preventing the return of post-Brexit border controls between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, it was up to the British premier to present a convincing alternative. But none have been forthcoming, Coveney said, echoing what European Union officials in Brussels have been saying, categorically contradicting Johnson. \u201cThis process cannot move forward unless and until the British government comes forward with actual proposals that make sense so we can interrogate them,\u201d Coveney told reporters as the government launched a fresh appeal to business to get ready for Britain potentially exiting the EU without a deal to smooth the transition. \u201cThe British government does need to hear this message very clearly both privately and publicly that this is a problem that\u2019s real, that\u2019s complex and needs a solution, and at the moment they haven\u2019t come forward with any solutions.\u201d In a separate interview with national broadcaster RTE, Coveney added that \u201cno proposals at all\u201d had so far emerged from the new British government.\n\nThe EU won\u2019t move on this issue without getting a recommendation to do so from Ireland. Even if they were inclined to act directly, they also haven\u2019t heard anything from Johnson, and responded to him today by declaring it has no idea what Johnson\u2019s talking about:\n\nThe EU said Wednesday it currently sees no alternative to the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d in a Brexit withdrawal deal and warned the risk of Britain crashing out without an agreement has increased. \u2026 But Brussels says that so far there are no other options which fulfil the EU requirements of protecting the Northern Irish peace agreement and safeguarding the European single market. \u201cThe backstop\u2026 is the only solution identified that safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, ensures compliance with international law obligations and preserves the integrity of the internal market,\u201d the commission said in its latest Brexit planning document.\n\nThat\u2019s been the EU position all along, and for good reason. The UK\u2019s Brexit project is explicitly designed to impose border controls \u2014 for both immigration and trade. It was fought and won on those specific grounds. Unfortunately, the UK already had a sovereign commitment to an open border in Ireland long before voting on Brexit, and more than three years later have yet to offer a solution that squares the circle. If the UK insists that Northern Ireland has to be part of Brexit \u2013which Tory partner DUP insists \u2014 then border controls will have to go up again and violate the GFA. The backstop would preserve the GFA while giving the UK more time to find a solution, but it would also delay their ability to set their own trade policy.\n\nThat\u2019s why Corbyn answered Johnson\u2019s taunts in Parliament by challenging the PM to disclose his proposals to keep the border open. Johnson claims he has solid ideas to share with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in meetings later this week, but Johnson has also claimed that the Irish should just trust the UK to solve the problem eventually, too. The Irish, needless to say, are not filled with trust of the British for many reasons, but their complete refusal to deal with the Northern Ireland question on Brexit is high on the acute list.\n\nRegardless, elections are inevitable. This situation is untenable, and all sides know it. The current majority in Parliament are only united in stopping a no-deal Brexit, but they\u2019re not even going to be able to agree on how to avoid it. They could have done so by passing May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement in March, which would have marginalized Johnson, and could still do so today. Instead, they\u2019ll default into a no-deal Brexit anyway, and then will either have to clean up the mess themselves or hold elections to see who gets to do so.\n\nAt least the debate was entertaining. It\u2019s not often one hears a British PM use the word \u201cshit\u201d on the floor of Parliament. Or \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d or \u201cchlorinated chicken,\u201d for that matter. The only question will be who gets Corbyn\u2019s tongue off the pole and whether Ralphie will get blamed for it.", "description": "EU: We are not removing the backstop from any deal.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/johnson-debate.png"}
