Trump\u2019s recent decision to pull back U.S. troops leaves those fighters vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said no American soldiers are in the area.\n\n\u201cFrom the first day I entered the political arena, I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars \u2014 especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States,\u201d Trump added. \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place_and we will hold them to this commitment.\u201d\n\nHe said the U.S. will monitor the situation closely.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump lashed out over sharp criticism of his decision to pull back U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, insisting he is focused on the \u201cBIG PICTURE\u201d that doesn\u2019t include American involvement in \u201cstupid endless wars\u201d in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets. \u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s words are at odds with longstanding U.S. policy of keeping thousands of American troops in the strategically important region, and his decision is being condemned by some of his staunchest Republican allies.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close Trump ally, stepped up his criticism of the president Wednesday, telling \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that if Trump \u201cfollows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\nIn tweets, Graham urged prayers for \u201cour Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\u201d adding, \u201cThis move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d He also said he would lead an effort in Congress to \u201cmake Erdogan pay a heavy price,\u201d referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAnother Trump ally, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the GOP leadership, said she was sickened by the prospect of a Turkish incursion. \u201cImpossible to understand,\u201d she tweeted, why Trump \u201cis leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\u201d\n\nTrump argued on Twitter that \u201cGOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!\u201d He said the U.S. went to war under a \u201cfalse & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE!\u201d\n\nTrump said he is \u201cslowly & carefully\u201d bringing home \u201cour great soldiers & military,\u201d in line with his campaign promise to do so.\n\nHis call for ending U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and bringing the troops home was a feature of his presidential campaign, but it flies in the face of many decades of bipartisan American policy, even as the Trump administration and its immediate predecessor have tried to give additional attention to what they see as long-term security threats elsewhere, including from China and Russia.\n\nThe U.S. has more than 10,000 troops based across the Middle East, including about 5,200 in Iraq, 1,000 in Syria and several thousand others at bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Also, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Mideast headquarters is at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.\n\nJust a couple of months ago the Pentagon reestablished a troop presence in Saudi Arabia after a lengthy absence, and in May it added air and naval forces in the region in response to what it views as worrying threats from Iran.\n\nAs a further sign that the military does not share Trump\u2019s view that the fight against the extremists is over, a press release Wednesday by the U.S.-led military coalition combating IS highlighted recent battlefield gains. It concluded by saying that \u201cremoving\u201d IS fighters, weapons and bomb materials \u201cremains a top priority\u201d as the group \u201ccontinues to plot attacks against innocent civilians and our partners throughout Iraq and northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nTrump has long criticized President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, but the subsequent rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State has convinced many national security officials, and lawmakers such as Graham, that a precipitous U.S. troop withdrawal from the region would leave the U.S. and its allies even more vulnerable to extremism.\n\nTrump also claimed the U.S. has spent $8 trillion \u201cfighting and policing\u201d in the Middle East, up from the $7 trillion figure he has cited numerous times.\n\nTrump is using an inflated estimate on the cost of wars and referring in part to predicted costs going decades into the future, not money actually spent. Some of the spending also reflects his policy decisions he made since taking office nearly three years ago.\n\nGraham said Congress \u201cwill push back\u201d against Turkey. He had said earlier this week that he was working on a bipartisan bill to sanction Turkey if they invade Syria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving Turkey a green light in Congress and we\u2019re not going to abandon the Kurds,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump announced Tuesday that he and Erdogan will meet at the White House on Nov. 13.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Wednesday the U.S. does not endorse Turkey's military assault on Syria, calling the operation a \"bad idea.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/ad98a9_trump-61545-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-ceremony-present-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
