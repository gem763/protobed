Flu is a serious illness and can even be deadly for the most vulnerable of our population.\n\n'Children are \u2018super spreaders\u2019 of flu. Flu vaccination not only protects the children but it also protects other more vulnerable members of the community from a potentially horrible illness.'\n\nHowever despite the overwhelming scientific research some parents still refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated.\n\nIndeed some so set against immunisations they plan to remove their children from school on 'vaccination day' to ensure they do not receive the flu vaccine, even though they can opt out of the programme.\n\nWhy are children given the flu vaccine? Flu is a very common infection in babies and children. It can be very unpleasant for them. Children with flu have the same symptoms as adults, including a high temperature, chills, aching muscles, a headache, a stuffy nose, a dry cough and a sore throat lasting up to a week. Some children develop a very high temperature or complications of flu, such as bronchitis, pneumonia and a painful ear infection. They may need hospital treatment, and very occasionally a child may die from flu. For children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease or lung disease, getting flu can be very serious as they're more at risk of developing serious complications. Immunising children against the flu also prevents it spreading to people they come into contact with.

However the vaccine contains viruses that have been weakened to prevent them causing flu.\n\nIt means a child can build up immunity to flu in a similar way as natural infection, but without the symptoms.\n\nDr Richard Pebody, Head of Flu, Public Health England explained: 'The nasal spray does not cause flu and there is no need for parents to keep their healthy children off school while the childhood vaccine programme is underway.'\n\nSeveral of the mothers who spoke to Femail claimed their children were struck by illness after coming into contact with particles released by the spray, even when not being administered with the vaccinations themselves.\n\nOthers claimed children who had received the vaccine later 'shed' the virus, infecting other children.\n\nHowever this was roundly dismissed by Dr Pebody: 'The nasal spray contains a weakened form of the flu virus and does not cause flu in those receiving the vaccine or those around them.\n\n'Contacts are not at risk of becoming seriously ill with the flu vaccine virus, either through being in the same room where flu vaccine has been given or by being in contact with a recently vaccinated individual.'\n\nThe nasal spray has been proven to vastly reduce the number of children hospitalised with influenza and who present with influenza-like symptoms.

In schools using vaccine, therefore, the overall risk of influenza transmission is massively reduced by having a large number of children vaccinated.'\n\nThere are some minor side effects associated with the flu vaccine. NHS guidelines children might develop a runny or blocked nose or headache after having the vaccine.\n\nIn very rare cases - about 1 in 900,000 vaccinations - a child can suffer a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine.", "description": "Primary school pupils will be given a nasal spray flu vaccine over the coming weeks as part of a nationwide NHS scheme to protect children against the illness.
