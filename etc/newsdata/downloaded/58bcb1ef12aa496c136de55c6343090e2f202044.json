Last week, the UAW notified Aramark that the extension would expire at midnight Saturday, the same time the union's contract with the Detroit Three automakers was set to expire.\n\nThe union, negotiating with GM for a new deal for autoworkers, extended contracts for Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, but told GM Saturday that it would not extend its contract. The UAW said, though, that autoworkers would report for Sunday shifts at GM plants.\n\nGM has outsourced many of its plant janitorial jobs and some other operational work to Aramark. Aramark manages service jobs at five GM sites: Flint Assembly, Flint Engine Operations, Flint Metal Center; the Metal Center Parma, Ohio, and the Technical Center in Warren.\n\nTommy Wolikow works at Flint Assembly, where Aramark provides the factory's main custodial staff. News of the strike shocked him, and he said he was unsure what to do when his shift starts at 10 p.m. Sunday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the UAW will let us cross the picket line,\u201d said Wolikow. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to anyways. But I haven\u2019t been told anything.\u201d\n\nMario Washington. though, was due to work at Flint Assembly at 6:48 a.m. and he planned to do so.\n\n\u201cWe gotta go to work,\u201d said Washington. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go to work, I get a write-up. It\u2019s contract time and the company gets touchy with discipline procedures. The UAW told us to report to work. It\u2019s an unfortunate thing, but everyone is going to go to work.\u201d\n\nWashington said he will be working at 10 a.m. Sunday when UAW leadership and the presidents of GM locals are meeting in Detroit. He will be awaiting instructions from the UAW.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in the plant and they\u2019ll tell us either they extended the contract or come in there and tell us we\u2019re on strike,\u201d said Washington.\n\nHarley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, Berkley, said the janitor strike \"amounts to a potentially significant escalation.\"\n\n\"It depends on what the contingency plan is, but GM has plans to seek to continue operations despite a strike. We don\u2019t know the details, it might just be to rely on other parts plants,\" he said. \"But if the contingency is to continue operations despite picket lines, that would unusual and unprecedented. If it involves crossing picket lines or running operations with supervisors, that would amount to an escalation. We don\u2019t know, but putting this out there right at the opening is an escalation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have UAW members who work long, hard hours and are still on public assistance,\u201d said Gerald Kariem, director of UAW Region 1D. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d\n\nKey issues for the janitors involve wages, caps on health insurance, vacation time and 401(k) plans, the union said.\n\nAutoworker contract talks\n\nRegarding the autoworker contract with GM, UAW leadership told members late Saturday afternoon that \"significant differences\" remained over key issues and bargaining would continue right up to the deadline.\n\nIn a letter sent to union officers Saturday evening, Terry Dittes, vice president for the UAW General Motors Department, said the contract with GM would not be extended, but no immediate autoworker strike was contemplated.\n\n\"No decisions or actions will be taken\" until after a National Council meeting scheduled for 10 a.m. in Detroit, the letter said.\n\nIn the letter obtained by the Free Press, Dittes reported \"some progress\" in negotiations since his last update some nine days ago.\n\nBut, \"We still have many outstanding issues remaining, including significant differences between the parties on wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing.\"\n\nGeneral Motors said in a statement: \u201cWe continue to work hard on solutions to some very difficult challenges. We are prepared to negotiate around the clock because there are thousands of GM families and their communities \u2014 and many thousands more at our dealerships and suppliers \u2014 counting on us for their livelihood.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "The United Auto Workers had told GM that autoworkers would report for their shifts Sunday even though the union's contract expired at midnight.", "authors": ["Jamie L.
