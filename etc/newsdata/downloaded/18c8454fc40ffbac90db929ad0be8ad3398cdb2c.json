Many clearly didn\u2019t have the skills, financial backing or customer service support needed to run a firm providing a near public good.\"\n\nNow, a new set of rules by regulator Ofgem are planned to make sure energy suppliers are fit for purpose.\n\nThe new rules would let Ofgem request independent audits of suppliers' customer service operations and financial status.\n\nThis would include new checks for growing suppliers to make sure they can effectively serve their customers. If they fail the checks, they would be stopped from taking new customers on.\n\nThere are also new \"fit and proper\" requirements for suppliers, to make sure the people in charge are good enough.\n\nAnd they can't come soon enough, according to Martin.\n\n\u201cIt was in March last year, in conversation with the Ofgem boss, that I first warned him that under-regulated small firms who no one should touch were perversely the biggest threat to competition,\" he said.\n\n\"Too many people have been burnt by poorly managed small companies, and that has knocked many people\u2019s faith in energy switching, and risks ultimately driving them back to the same big companies the hope was that they\u2019d escape from.\n\n\u201cA few months ago we were delighted to see Ofgem introduce those checks for new firms \u2013 now it is important that similar rules are put in place for existing firms that were already set up before those changes came into being.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nOfgem's Mary Starks said: \"The new proposals will create more accountability in the market, require more responsible and appropriate behaviour from suppliers in the market and reduce the risk and costs to consumers associated with supplier failure.\n\n\"In the event a supplier fails, the changes will also strengthen the 'safety net' and improve the experience of customers when they are transferred, so that consumers can be reassured that whatever happens they will be properly protected.\"", "description": "Badly run energy firms have been regularly going bust for three years running, but new rules could put a stop to all that and financial guru Martin Lewis is jubilant", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Get Reading", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13891298.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Martin-Lewis-Money-Show-in-Reading.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
