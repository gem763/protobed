There were 5,179 plug-in hybrid electric vehicle registrations, while 16,932 hybrid electric vehicles were registered. By contrast, 224,828 petrol cars and 77,510 diesel ones were registered in the same month.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of green-colored plates is not a new idea. In Ontario, Canada, for example, drivers of battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have the option of using plates with green text. On certain stretches of road these plates enable drivers to use high occupancy vehicle lanes and high occupancy toll lanes \u2014 the latter for free \u2014 even if one person is in the car.\n\n\n\nBack in the U.K., Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates acknowledged that while green license plates may encourage some to choose cleaner cars, if ministers wanted to boost the take-up of electric vehicles they \"should introduce more charging points and better financial incentives.\"\n\n\"A national scrappage scheme is urgently needed too, to help fund a switch to a cleaner vehicle or greener transport alternative \u2014 such as car club membership, a rail season ticket or even an e-bike loan,\" she added.", "description": "Drivers with green plates could get benefits including cheaper parking.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106093986-1566569162966gettyimages-946706948.jpeg?v=1571742218", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
