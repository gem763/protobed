At least 17 people nationwide have died from vaping-related illnesses. The cause is unclear, although several federal and state agencies are investigating.\n\nResearchers from the Mayo Clinic found the lung damage was similar to a chemical burn. \"It seems to be some kind of direct chemical injury, similar to what one might see with exposures to toxic chemical fumes, poisonous gases and toxic agents,\" Dr. Brandon Larsen, a surgical pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, said in a hospital press release.\n\nThe researchers looked at samples of lung tissue from 17 people, all of whom had vaped and 70% had used marijuana or cannabis oils. Two of the samples were taken from patients who died, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe accumulation of fatty substances such as oils were suspected in the lung damage, but researchers said there was no evidence they were the cause.\n\nRead More", "description": "Lung damage in those using e-cigarettes might be caused by chemicals in the vape liquid, according to a letter published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe", "Ben Tinker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191003021128-vaping-lung-disease-chemicals-super-tease.jpg"}
