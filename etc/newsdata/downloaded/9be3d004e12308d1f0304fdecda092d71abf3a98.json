Some brands say they are flushable but they don\u2019t biodegrade at all. They come out of the sewers and end up back on the beaches.\u201d\n\nIn northern Scotland they found up to 30 tonnes of fishing gear, including nylon rope. Plastic which gets blown inland endangers sheep if they eat it.\n\nThere is also the danger of micro-plastics, which break down into a powder that fish we eat may consume. Kiko said: \u201cIf everyone picked up just three bits of litter a day think what a better place our wildlife would be in.\u201d\n\nUK recycling company First Mile provided RecycleBoxes at each location for the waste which was sent to its lab for analysis.\n\nMost commonly found were plastic bottles, tubs and cups followed by cans and glass. Yet 60 per cent of the rubbish collected could have been recycled.\n\nThe worst beach, aside from the one in northern Scotland, was Magilligan Point in Co Londonderry, Northern Ireland, where nearly 40st of beach waste was collected by just 12 \u00advolunteers.\n\nAbout 85 per cent was fishing industry debris, such as ropes, nets and plastic containers.\n\nThe south and south-west coast beaches were the cleanest, with Minehead in Somerset and Budleigh Salterton in Devon the best. The clean up fits perfectly with Kiko\u2019s motto: \u201cliving and \u00adgiving\u201d.\n\nLast March she set a new record \u2013 as the \u00adfastest woman to row solo and unsupported across the Atlantic, in 49 days, 7 hours and 15 minutes.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nIn doing so, she won the Pride of Britain\u2019s Sporting Fundraiser of 2018 and raised nearly \u00a3100,000 for South London\u2019s King\u2019s College Hospital, where a medical team had saved her life.\n\nTen years ago Kiko\u2019s dad suggested she go to the GP as she was experiencing bizarre symptoms, such as a metallic taste in her mouth.\n\nShe said: \u201cI also felt odd in myself. I was away with the fairies half the time. I\u2019d stopped sleeping properly and was alert and awake, brimming with ideas at 4am.\u201d\n\nShe was also getting spots and putting on weight. Initially, after blood tests, she was diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy short-term memory was \u00adgetting worse. In the supermarket I\u2019d \u00adcompare prices and forget what I\u2019d just looked at.\n\n\u201cI was doing strange things. At one point I went online and bought my dad 88 light bulbs. Then I ordered lots of DVDs with French subtitles.\u201d\n\nHer mum, a nurse, started looking more closely at her symptoms and suggested she could have Cushing\u2019s disease \u2013 a \u00adbenign tumour of the pituitary gland in the brain.\n\nKiko said: \u201cI had psychosis, skin-thinning, osteoporosis, I couldn\u2019t walk upstairs unaided. Mum and I googled it together and all my symptoms were there. I couldn\u2019t \u00adbelieve it.\u201d\n\nAn MRI showed a 6mm brain tumour effecting her pituitary gland which was pumping out high levels of the \u00adhormone cortisol, hence her elevated mood and excess energy.\n\nShe was put on medicine to reduce hormone levels but while waiting surgery the potassium in her body plummeted. She went straight into intensive care.\n\nShe said: \u201cI honestly thought I was \u00adgoing to die. They used a massive syringe which took seven different attempts to find a place to pump potassium back into my body.\n\n\u201cI went in for surgery \u2013to have the \u00adtumour taken out through my nose.\n\n\u201cThey started me on recovery meds after that and quite quickly everything started returning to normal.\u201d The near-death \u00adexperience led to the South Londoner re-evaluate her life and over the following two years.\n\nIn 2011 she quit her secondary school \u00adteaching job. She said: \u201cI was passionate about science but I wasn\u2019t loving it. I\u2019d been given this second chance at life and I wanted whatever I did to help the planet and others.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nShe set up Trash4Treats, a campaign that encouraged paddle boarders to clear litter from London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Canal.\n\nIn 2016, pal Charlie Pitcher who, at the time, held the men\u2019s solo record for \u00adrowing the Atlantic, \u00adsuggested she have a bash at the women\u2019s record. Kiko started training but six months before the challenge she had to have a second tumour removed.\n\nShe said: \u201cI \u00adrealise now the tumour returning had sent me loopy again and all that confidence and \u00adexcess energy that went into the rowing \u00adchallenge was because of my hormones. Strangely, probably wouldn\u2019t have decided to do it but for the tumour.\u201d\n\nOn the crossing, she barely ate due to nausea. She took 50 days of food, and landed in Barbados with 27 days worth left. She said she struggles to remember the \u00adexperience.\n\nLast year Kiko, who is currently staying on friends\u2019 sofas, started planning her beach clean-up. The ex-molecular biology student used her rowing success to get firms to sponsor her trip and arrange their own beach clean-ups.\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a9Todd-White Art Photography 2019)\n\nShe kipped in a friend\u2019s end-of-garden London cabin to save pennies, then crammed all her possessions into the back of a van and set off around Britain on her bike. Kind-hearted locals helped put her up in some places.\n\nShe said: \u201cOne woman let me sleep in this amazing glass dome she had in her garden. Other times we camped or local hotels put us up.\u201d\n\nKiko\u2019s already planning the next beach clean-up \u2013 and it\u2019s even bigger than this one. \u201cI want to clean up beaches from London to Monaco via Gibraltar next.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have check-ups anymore. I sometimes look at myself if I\u2019ve put on weight and think, \u2018is that my diet or the Cushing\u2019s coming back?\u2019 but I\u2019d rather fill my days doing something positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I inspire people and bring awareness of what we can all do as \u00adindividuals to help the world.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Kiko and First Mile visit Kikomatthews.co.uk and recyclebox.co.uk\n\nAbout RecycleBox\n\nRecycleBox has been developed by First Mile to help the UK reach its recycling targets and overcome its stagnant household recycling rates.\n\nRecycleBox offers consumers and businesses an easy and low-cost recycling post-back service aimed at those that want to do their bit for the environment.\n\nThe box is a recycling solution for many items not collected in traditional household recycling or waste collection schemes, such as compostable packaging, coat hangers, shoes and coffee pods.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Kiko Matthews has become the fastest woman to row solo and unsupported across the Atlantic and has cycled some 4,500 miles to help tidy up Britain\u2019s plastic-ridden shoreline", "authors": ["Emma Pryer", "Image", "Internet Unknown", "Pa Wire Pa Images", "\u00c2 Todd-White Art Photography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566036.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_image00029jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
