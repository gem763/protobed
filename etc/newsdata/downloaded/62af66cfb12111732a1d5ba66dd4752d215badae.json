The Chinese have been brewing vinegar for some 3,000 years \u2013 prized for its sharp and refreshing flavour and the way it dispels oiliness in food and arouses the appetite.\n\nSweet and sour pork remains one of the most popular Chinese dishes.\n\nChinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop explains how, as well as enjoying the sour taste of vinegar as a condiment, the Chinese also use it widely in cooking. Sweet and sour pork remains one of the most popular Chinese dishes and in Sichuan cuisine you also get what is known as \u201clychee flavour\u201d, which is a little more sour than sweet, like the fruit. There\u2019s also the flavour combination of \u201csour and hot\u201d with the sour taste coming from vinegar and the heat from chilies or ground white pepper.\n\nThe Sichuanese also love to get their sour taste from pickled vegetables. At the end of every meal they usually have a bowl full of rice, with pickles to send the rice on its way. In the past, every household pickled their own veg: pink radishes, carrots and cabbages with vinegar, liquor and spices. And when Sichuanese women married, they would take a pickle jar with its old brine as part of their dowry!", "description": "Some of the great ways we can bring more zing into our culinary lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07pt4zf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
