Namely, that Republicans are racist and that the real shame of today is that we have \u201camnesia\u201d by not treating white supremacy seriously. Yes, on the anniversary of the worst attack on America in history, instead of reflecting on Islamic terrorism or simply focusing on the victims, CNN decided to run interference for terrorists and lecture Americans on the violence of \u201cright-wingers.\u201d\n\nBecause of course they did. They couldn\u2019t give it a rest for even one day.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of one of the graphics they put up.\n\nYes, this was a real segment. It was so absurd that some people actually thought the captures of it going around were photoshopped.\n\nCNN calls it a \u201creality check\u201d and instead of focusing on what happened on 9/11, including who perpetrated it, they deflect to blaming \u201cRight-wingers\u201d for being the \u201cdeadliest terrorists.\u201d I\u2019m a right-winger. Am I a terrorist now? CNN apparently thinks so based on their vague use of language, which is obviously purposeful.\n\nactual quote: \u201cHere's a startling statistic: since 9/11, right-wing terrorists killed more people in the United States than jihadist terrorist.\u201d Ah, yes. they are the worst if you discount the worst. \u2014 T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) September 11, 2019\n\nWait, you mean if you wipe away 3,000 victims of Islamic terrorism from the record, suddenly Islamists don\u2019t lead in the body count? Shocking if true.\n\nI can\u2019t begin to explain how ridiculous and disgusting this is. Today is about remembering the victims of 9/11. CNN ignores the dead and wants to rant about right wingers being terrorists. How do they think that makes the families of the victims feel? That they are so unimportant, so subservient to the leftist narrative, that they aren\u2019t even counted in order for CNN to force a point.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times decided to only push out a single editorial today discussing 9/11. What was it about? America\u2019s Islamophobia of course.\n\nIt is pretty incredible that on the 18th anniversary of 9/11, the NYT online op-ed page has precisely one editorial on that historic marker \u2014 and it\u2019s about the effects of Islamophobia on American Muslims post-9/11. pic.twitter.com/dpBAZO3eJG \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) September 11, 2019\n\nThe press at large are just trash. They couldn\u2019t give it a rest for one day. Not one stinking day.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
