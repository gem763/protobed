I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s stuck with him when others would have written him off as a monster.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe for one minute he bought her any of those things to be romantic.\n\n\"The way his brain works, he\u2019ll have been seeing the benefit to him.\"\n\nLita had reportedly been made a widow soon before Putman made advances towards her in 2006.\n\nPutman was jailed for nine years after being found guilty of fraud.\n\nRapist Putman, from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, conspired with friend Giles Knibbs - who worked in the securities department at Camelot between 2004 and 2010.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nAuthorities released an image of the ticket he used to con Camelot out of the jackpot in a near-perfect forgery that even fooled the top Lotto operator.\n\nThe genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been discovered.\n\nPassing sentence, judge Philip Grey said the \"sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud\" struck at the heart of the integrity of the National Lottery.\n\nHe said: \"You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy.\n\n\"This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public's trust in the lottery itself.\"\n\nThe judge said the fact Camelot had been \"hoodwinked in this way will of course be damaging to its reputation\".\n\nThe court was also told that Putman had previous convictions for rape and benefit fraud.\n\nPutman was paid the jackpot by Camelot despite the bottom part of the mangled slip missing the barcode, the trial heard.\n\nHe submitted a damaged fake ticket to take the top prize in September 2009 that matched a real National Lottery ticket bought in Worcester in March earlier that year.\n\nThe trial was told Mr Knibbs did not feel he had received his fair share of the jackpot, which was paid out to Putman, and they had a bitter argument.\n\nMr Knibbs killed himself later that year, the court was told, having been arrested for burglary, blackmail and criminal damage.", "description": "Builder Edward Putman, 54, was found guilty of fraud by false representation after claiming an outstanding jackpot of \u00a32.5 million with a fake ticket in 2009", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Pa", "Sunday Mirror", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574933.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Edward-Putman-court-case.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
