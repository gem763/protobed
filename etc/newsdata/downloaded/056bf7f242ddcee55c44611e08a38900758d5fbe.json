A local derby, under the lights, it'll be a great atmosphere,' he said.\n\n'It's a big game in midweek, one we're looking forward to and we want to go as far as we can in the cup.\n\n'There is definitely some learning going on. It's been a rock-solid start.\n\n'A good foundation. We've been unlucky not to come away with points in some games. Those fine margins are what we are learning as we go.'\n\nAfter the weekend's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, Villa also welcome leaders Liverpool in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nThey are 15th in the top flight and Heaton feels facing the division's top two in quick succession can benefit the team.\n\nJack Grealish (right) is likely to miss the Carabao Cup clash due to a problem with his calf\n\n'There are things we can take (from Manchester City). That added belief. It's the first time coming to City for a lot of the lads,' said the England international.\n\n'The way we tried to impact the game means we can take things from it. It's at Villa Park next week. Hopefully we can take the game on.'\n\nJack Grealish is likely to sit out on Wednesday after receiving a kick to the calf at the Etihad.\n\nJota is a couple of weeks away from returning to full training after hernia surgery while James Chester has stepped up his recovery from a hamstring problem but is not yet ready.\n\nJonathan Kodjia is also close to returning from a fractured cheekbone.", "description": "Tom Heaton knows Aston Villa must be prepared for a hostile derby with Wolves.
