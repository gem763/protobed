For decades, he has taken a cut from every ton of smuggled cargo, including every ounce of illegal drugs.\n\nThe authorities know that he\u2019s dirty, but they\u2019ve never been able to pin anything on him because he covers his tracks and has earned the loyalty of the dockworkers by keeping their best interests at heart.\n\nThese days, the authorities aren\u2019t even trying because O\u2019Connell has made himself indispensable to them, tipping them off to illegal arms shipments and signs of terrorist activity. The way he sees it, smuggling is inevitable, so he may as well benefit from it, but he has a moral code of sorts and his greed has limits.\n\nAs Jack Flynn\u2019s debut novel, \u201cBlood in the Water,\u201d opens, however, the international Salvadoran gang known as MS-13 is hellbent on shoving O\u2019Connell aside to seize control of the waterfront rackets. When an attempt on O\u2019Connell\u2019s life fails, the gang\u2019s leaders, including Javier Carpio and his psychopathic brother Vincente, prepare for all-out war. But O\u2019Connell has an ally in Kit Steele, a Boston-based Homeland Security agent.\n\nFrom the outset, the motivations of Steele and the Carpios are complicated. Steele wants vengeance against MS-13, holding them responsible for the brutal murders of her husband and son several years ago. The Carpios, whose friends and family were victims of a U.S.-supported war in El Salvador, seek not only to control the waterfront but also to murder Americans by the thousands. And when the Carpios kidnap O\u2019Connell\u2019s pregnant daughter, the war becomes personal to him, too.\n\nFlynn does a fine job developing complex characters while keeping the tension high in this fast-paced yarn of intrigue, violence and personal betrayals. His prose, for the most part, is tight and precise. And his setting - the waterfront docks and the mostly abandoned harbor islands that are unfamiliar even to most Bostonians - is vividly portrayed. So is the weather, the action unfolding during a bitter winter that has clogged the shipping lines with ice floes.\n\nThis debut by a Boston lawyer who has worked pro bono for the wrongly convicted is likely to have readers looking forward to a planned sequel.\n\n___\n\nBruce DeSilva, winner of the Mystery Writers of America\u2019s Edgar Award, is the author of the Mulligan crime novels including \u201cThe Dread Line.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.brucedesilva.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Blood in the Water: a Thriller,\" Minotaur, by Jack Flynn", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bruce Desilva"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/book_review_-_blood_in_the_water_52985_c0-878-1875-1971_s1770x1032.jpg?74d9889e760849ad24e1a9344ac67f54e81798b1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
