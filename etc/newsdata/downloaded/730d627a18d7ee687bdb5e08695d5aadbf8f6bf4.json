Yet gold longs can\u2019t seem to wait as the yellow metal\u2019s price dipped on Monday on fears the Federal Reserve will not ease at its policy meeting later this month.\n\nfor December delivery settled down $8.50, or 0.6%, at $1,504.40 per ounce as Investing.com\u2019s showed the probability for a quarter-point cut when the Fed meets Oct. 28-29 at 72.7%, versus 78% on Friday.\n\nThe reduced probability for a rate cut continued to hurt gold in post-settlemt trade, pushing it beneath the key $1,500 support.\n\nBy 3:15 PM ET (19:15 GMT), December gold fell $15.45, or 1%, to $1,497.45.\n\n, reflective of trades in bullion, slipped $12.63, or 0.8%, to $1,492.11.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, one of the central bank\u2019s most outspoken policy doves, said that while the Fed should be supporting the economy from downside risks, there was no clarity on the number of rate cuts required of it, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGold longs took that as a measure of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWhile a series of U.S. data prints suggested that the American growth engine may be at risk of stalling, and has seen October Fed pricing incorporate a near 75% likelihood of a cut, gold prices have still struggled to rally much further,\u201d TD Securities said in a note.\n\n\u201cGiven the non farm print failed to lock in the October cut, and more importantly, the change in language vis-a-vis the prospect of further cuts, the market is likely to take a wait-and-see approach with trade talks as the next major catalyst for the complex.\u201d\n\nGold rallied on Friday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was examining strategies that might help it to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2% inflation.\n\nSo far this year, the Fed has conducted two quarter-point rate cuts, back to back in July and September, to try and preserve the U.S. economy's record decade-long growth.\n\nRate-cut expectations have cooled after upward revisions to job gains in the prior months and a at a 50-year low failed to support the recession narrative.", "description": "Gold Dips as U.S. Rate-Cut Expectations Slide", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0O0JM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
