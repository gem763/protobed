But now the president's latest remarks about oil have raised new concerns regarding his future plans for Syria.\n\nDonald Trump has made similar comments in the past about tapping oil from other countries racked by war, but not while in the Oval Office.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The raid on Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's compound, he added, demonstrates that terrorists are operating in parts of the country that the Syrian government doesn\u2019t control.\n\nAnd now that the US has killed the Isis leader and the caliphate has lost its territory, critics say it is time to get out of the country and let the Assad regime take the lead in going after terrorists in its territory.\n\nTrump has long argued, correctly, that endless wars have cost a tremendous amount of money to American taxpayers and there is no national security interest to commit long-term resources in Syria with no end goal.\n\n\u201cBut the process is so botched and incoherent, and the decision has been reached without consulting allies and partners, that it is clear to me that any benefits of withdrawing are being more than compensated by the costs of poor execution,\u201d said Thomas Juneau, professor of International Affairs at the University of Ottawa and former Middle East analyst at the Department of National Defence.\n\n\u201cThis is very unfortunate for US interests, which are not being well served at all by all this confusion, but also for those who, like me, believe that the US should act with more restraint in the Middle East,\u201d Mr Juneau told The Independent.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s decisions over the last few weeks in Syria have played contrary to the argument that it is in the interest of the US to exercise restraint in the region.\n\nAnd critics argue that as of late October, nobody really knows what the US policy is in Syria. What seems clear now is that the number of troops being deployed to the oil region is not very different from before the withdrawal was announced.\n\nAnd the United States seems to be pursuing competing objectives on the ground. \u201cWe have an envoy to Syria, Jim Jefferies, who still seems attracted to the idea that we can do something to hurt the Assad regime \u2026 even if not aimed at regime change,\u201d Mr Friedman said, adding that \u201ccounterterrorism in the country is best served by giving up the fantasy that we can undermine the Assad regime and let it govern Syria.\u201d", "description": "Having provoked bipartisan and international condemnation for abruptly announcing a withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, effectively greenlighting\u00a0the subsequent Turkish incursion into largely Kurdish-held territory, Donald Trump quickly did an about face.\u00a0 Some troops, he announced last week, would be returning to the country.
