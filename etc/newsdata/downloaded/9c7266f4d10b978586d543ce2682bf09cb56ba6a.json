Daniel Spitz via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27)\n\nUpdated records: Boser (17-5-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC), Spitz (6-3 MMA, 1-3 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Boser\u2019s evenly distributed striking attack saw him official land 33 to the head, 25 to the body, and 35 to the leg.\n\nBoser on winning his UFC debut by decision\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fight I was expecting. It\u2019s how I fight. I know people boo and don\u2019t like it, but unless they want to pay my rent, I\u2019m getting my win bonus. I don\u2019t care. The leg kick is one of my best techniques. I have two wins by leg kick TKO, which is a very rare stoppage, so I always look to implement those.\u201d\n\nBoser on octagon jitters\n\n\u201cMy friends and family, everyone from back home \u2013 UFC is such a big deal to them because it\u2019s what they watch every week and what they follow. To me, honestly, it didn\u2019t feel different. I\u2019ve been in the big show before, but I\u2019ve been in the big show overseas. This feeling was nothing new to me, but it was big to my friends and family and to my hometown where I\u2019m from. So I\u2019m proud to represent them in that capacity.\u201d\n\nBoser on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI hope I can get one more in before the end of 2019. I\u2019m good to go man.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Boser, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.", "description": "Tanner Boser doesn't plan to change going forward after winning his octagon debut at UFC on ESPN 6.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Simon Samano", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tanner-boser-ufc-boston-post-fight-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
