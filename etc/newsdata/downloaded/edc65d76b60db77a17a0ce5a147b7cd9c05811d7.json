Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are expecting to meet the following day with President Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe administration is trying to contain the fallout from Erdogan\u2019s decision to send forces last week to attack Syrian Kurdish militia that were Washington\u2019s close allies.\n\nActing last week after a phone call with Erdogan, President Donald Trump swiftly upended five years of U.S. policy with his unexpected decision to withhold protection from Syria\u2019s Kurds.\n\nErdogan has insisted there will be no ceasefire, and said he might call off a visit to the United States next month because of the \u201cvery big disrespect\u201d shown by U.S. politicians.\n\nHe also denounced Washington for taking the \u201cunlawful, ugly step\u201d of imposing criminal charges against a Turkish state bank over charges it broke sanctions on Iran.\n\nSyrian government troops accompanied by Russian forces meanwhile entered the city of Kobani, a strategically important border city and a potential flashpoint for a wider conflict, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the eight-year-old Syrian war, reported.\n\nTheir reported arrival follows a deal cut between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces militia, which has controlled the city, and Damascus to deploy the Syrian army in border areas to help fend off the Turkish offensive.\n\nTurkey\u2019s assault forced Washington to abandon a strategy in place for five years and pull its troops from northern Syria.\n\nIt has spawned a humanitarian crisis, with 160,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump, accused by congressional leaders, including fellow Republicans, of betraying loyal U.S. allies, the Kurds.\n\nSyrian government forces, backed by Washington\u2019s adversaries Russia and Iran, have meanwhile taken advantage of the power vacuum left by retreating U.S. troops to advance swiftly into the largest swath of territory previously outside their grasp.\n\nTrump played down the crisis on Wednesday, saying the conflict was between Turkey and Syria and that it was \u201cfine\u201d for Russia to help its ally Damascus. Sanctioning Turkey would be better than fighting in the region, he said.\n\nWashington announced sanctions to punish Turkey on Monday, but Trump\u2019s critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact.\n\nA day later U.S. prosecutors\u2019 charges were unveiled against Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank for taking part in a scheme to evade Iran sanctions. Washington says the case is unrelated to politics. Halkbank denies wrongdoing and called the case part of the sanctions against Turkey.\n\nErdogan\u2019s spokesman said Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions.\n\nU.S. \u201cSHOW OF FORCE\u201d\n\nThe Turkish advance, and Washington\u2019s need to swiftly evacuate its own forces, have brought the two biggest militaries in NATO close to confrontation on the battlefield. Washington has complained about Turkish artillery fire near its troops.\n\nIn the latest potential flashpoint, U.S. military aircraft made a \u201cshow of force\u201d over Kobani after Turkish-backed fighters came close to American troops there, a U.S. official said.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nPence said Erdogan had promised Trump by phone that Turkey would not attack Kobani, where U.S. forces first came to the aid of Kurds against Islamic State, which massacred Kurdish civilians there in 2014.\n\nErdogan said he had not broken his promise to Trump: \u201cMr Trump\u2019s remark on Kobani was \u2018Don\u2019t strike there\u2019,\u201d Erdogan told reporters late on Tuesday. \u201cWe said that we had only done an encircling operation there at the moment.\u201d\n\nLAND RUSH\n\nWashington\u2019s hasty exit has created a land rush between Turkey and Russia - now the undisputed foreign powers in the area - to partition the formerly U.S.-protected Kurdish area.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Russian troops had crossed the Euphrates River to advance to Kobani\u2019s outskirts.\n\nLebanon\u2019s al-Mayadeen TV reported that Russian-backed Syrian forces had also set up outposts in Raqqa, the one-time capital of Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, which the Kurds captured in 2017 at the peak of their campaign with U.S. support.\n\nHours after Washington announced its pullout on Sunday, the Kurds made a rapid deal with Washington\u2019s adversaries, the Russia- and Iran-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussia-backed Syrian troops have swiftly moved across the breadth of the Kurdish-held area including Manbij city, a target of Turkey which U.S. forces said on Tuesday they had quit.\n\nReuters journalists travelling with Syrian government forces on Tuesday entered Manbij and saw Russian and Syrian flags on buildings nearby. Russian state media said on Wednesday Syrian government forces had occupied bases abandoned by U.S. troops.\n\nErdogan, due in Moscow later this month, said he had told President Vladimir Putin that Russia could move forces into Manbij, provided that the Kurdish YPG militia was cleared out.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nErdogan says Trump approved his plan for a \u201csafe zone\u201d about 30 km (20 miles) inside Syria. Trump says he did not endorse the plan but Washington could not stay to police the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThey say \u2018declare a ceasefire\u2019. We will never declare a ceasefire,\u201d Erdogan told reporters. \u201cOur goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. Security Council said it was concerned by the risks of a deterioration in the humanitarian situation in northeast Syria and the escape of Islamic State fighters, but made no reference to the Turkish assault.\n\nThe Turkish campaign shows no sign of abating on the ground, with most fighting so far around two border cities, Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad.", "description": "The Trump administration dispatched its top officials to Turkey on Wednesday for emergency talks to try to persuade Ankara to halt an assault on northern Syria, while Russian troops swept into territory abandoned by Washington in a sudden retreat.", "authors": ["Tuvan Gumrukcu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441596646&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F18C", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
