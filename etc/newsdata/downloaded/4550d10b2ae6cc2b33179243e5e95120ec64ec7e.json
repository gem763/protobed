I didn't want to get fixed into weight loss programs and I didn't want to be noticed as a failure.\"\n\nAfter replacing her breakfast with a shake she started to see results - and eventually switched to two meal replacement drinks a day.\n\nShe added: \"I often put one in my drink cup/shaker and put in my handbag so I don't make bad choices when I am out.\"\n\nThe mother also adopted a healthy lifestyle, increasing her exercise and eating healthy food.\n\nMs Burrows said: \"Getting active was the hardest part. I was the laziest person. I now exercise daily and have never missed, in all this time, a day of my exercise \u2014 I feel lost if I haven't done it!\"\n\nThe Australian claims to have never felt happier and is confident she will keep the weight off.", "description": "Jackie Burrows, from Brisbane, Australia, put on weight after having children but decided to transform her life when she hit 127kg", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754339.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-022649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
