China's far away. If they consider it to be close, it's their problem.\n\n'In life, you have to choose whether to be happy and find a job you enjoy doing or work just for money.\n\n'For me, money is a means and not an end; if it's an end for them then they should go to China.'\n\nMertens and Callejon have been regulars in the Napoli first-team this season, having made eight and nine appearances so far this season. The former has scored six goals in that time, while Callejon has just the one strike to date.", "description": "Dries Mertens and Jose Callejon have been told that the grass won't necessarily be greener on the other side should they leave Napoli at the end of the season.", "authors": ["Luke Augustus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19844098-0-image-a-3_1571325043997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
