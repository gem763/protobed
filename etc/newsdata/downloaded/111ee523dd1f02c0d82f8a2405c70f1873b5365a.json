The 'recycling' business by the two was allegedly highly active and lucrative and never saw any of the dagga dealers whose loot was stolen behind bars,\" said Mulaudzi.\n\nThey are facing charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice.\n\nNgcobo and Butting are expected to be back in court on July 7.\n\nLieutenant General Lebeya said the investigation demonstrated the police's unwavering determination to disrupt and dismantle drug traffickers and drug organisations that operate in the country.\n\n\"These officers are not a reflection of the majority of the men and women in the SAPS (South African Police Service) who work hard every day. While we accept that the members are innocent until proven otherwise, we shall not hesitate to ensure that those who are involved in criminal activities are visited.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "The two officers allegedly routinely stole large amounts of dagga to resupply to the streets, say the Hawks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7444/e463cafad9564a30a2cad454c69cfbe9.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-27"}
