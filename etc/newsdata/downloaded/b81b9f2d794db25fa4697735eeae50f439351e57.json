One of the longest-serving officials on Trump\u2019s Cabinet and the wife of close Trump ally Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Chao has been accused of improperly using her office to benefit herself and a shipping company owned by her family.\n\nIn a letter to the secretary, Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) noted that it\u2019s illegal for federal employees to use a public office for \u201cthe private gain of friends, relatives or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a non-governmental capacity.\u201d\n\nYet, the lawmakers \u2015 citing earlier reporting by The New York Times and Politico \u2015 said of Chao: \u201cSeveral reports indicate that you have used your official position to benefit Foremost Group, a shipping company owned by your father and sisters that is headquartered in New York and operates a fleet that transports materials to and from China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese reports suggest that you used your official position \u2026. to elevate Foremost Group\u2019s influence and status with the Chinese government,\u201d the letter continued, adding that China had extended \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in low-interest loans\u201d to the company.\n\nAccording to the Times, Chao has no formal affiliation or financial stake in Foremost Group \u2015 but she and McConnell have reportedly received millions of dollars in gifts from Chao\u2019s father, James. McConnell has also received at least $1 million in campaign contributions from Chao\u2019s dad and sister, Angela, Foremost Group\u2019s chief executive.\n\nExclusive: Reporting by The New York Times shows how the family of Elaine Chao, transportation secretary and wife of Senator Mitch McConnell, prospered as the family\u2019s shipping company developed deep ties to China\u2019s political and economic elite. https://t.co/BouVco8T2P \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) June 2, 2019\n\nCummings and Krishnamoorthi said Chao has until the end of the month to hand over a slew of documents to the Oversight Committee, including copies of communications between Chao and her family members, as well as documents related to an official trip to China in 2017 that was canceled.\n\nThe Times said the trip had been \u201cabruptly\u201d axed after staffers in Chao\u2019s department expressed concerns about the secretary\u2019s plans in China, including inviting relatives to meetings with Chinese government officials.\n\nA spokesperson for the Transportation Department confirmed to The Washington Post that the department had received the committee\u2019s letter and looked forward to responding.\n\n\u201cMedia attacks targeting the Secretary\u2019s family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee said Monday that Chao was also under investigation for her failure to divest from Vulcan Materials Co., a construction company where Chao had served on the board of directors before her appointment to Trump\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nChao had promised in early 2017 to cash out her stock holdings in Vulcan by April 2018, Cummings and Krishnamoorthi wrote in their letter. But she didn\u2019t end up selling her shares until June 2019 \u2015 after The Wall Street Journal published a story in which she was called out for having failed to fulfill her promise.", "description": "Chao has been accused of using her office to benefit herself and her family's shipping company.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80a41f230000e903558954.jpeg?cache=rhudzez3cf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
