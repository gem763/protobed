Uncontrolled immigration and not documenting residents IS a problem.\n\nFor a society to plan infrastructure and the provision of services, it needs a certain amount of knowledge about population movements.\n\nIt also needs to be able to identify those who are within its borders so that they can access services and records can be kept.\n\nMaking sure that those within borders are documented \u2013 whether they were born there or not \u2013 is also key to ensuring everyone\u2019s safety.\n\nThis is the point that Herman Mashaba, the mayor of this city that is God\u2019s masterpiece, has been trying to make since he took office in 2016.\n\nHis repeated calls for foreign nationals to be documented was conveniently distorted to mean that they must leave Johannesburg.\n\nThe foot soldiers of political correctness jumped up and down and accused him of hating foreigners.\n\nHe stood his ground and governing party politicians from other tiers are now coming around to his way of thinking.\n\nEven a genuine intention to solve a problem is an invitation to condemnation from the PC brigade.\n\nRemember when former health minister Aaron Motsoaledi correctly highlighted the burden that public health facilities face as a result of having to cater for more than they are able to? He was lynched.\n\nIn his comments, Motsoaledi pointed out that, unlike in most other countries, migrants \u2013 including refugees \u2013 could move freely and access services like any other citizen. This was having an effect.\n\n\u201cThe weight that foreign nationals are bringing to the country has got nothing to do with xenophobia\u2026 it\u2019s a reality. Our hospitals are full. When a woman is pregnant and about to have a baby, you can\u2019t turn her away from a hospital and say she is a foreign national \u2026 you can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd when they deliver a premature baby, you have to keep them in hospital. When more come, you can\u2019t say the hospital is full, go away \u2026 they have to be admitted; we have no option. And when they get admitted in large numbers, they cause overcrowding and infection control starts failing.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. A straight-forward, nonjudgemental factual statement committing to treating all who wish to enter public facilities equally.\n\nBut Motsoaledi attracted fire and brimstone, and was even accused of using foreign nationals as scapegoats to mask his department\u2019s failure to run the public health system across the country.\n\nThere is a tendency to want to shut down any discussion about the uncontrolled migration of possibly millions of people in the republic. It is as if this would be a precursor to purges and pogroms.\n\nThis is tantamount to sticking our collective heads in the sand and wishing that the problem would solve itself. It won\u2019t. We need to have robust and honest conversations about this matter if we are to come up with workable solutions.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that, even with its anaemic growth rate and its myriad crises, South Africa will always be an Eldorado for our continental brethren and for many in underdeveloped countries beyond the seas.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, Abidemi, Manu and Ndiaye will make their way from the west of the continent, while Liban, Diara and Yurik make their way from the east.\n\nTrythanks, Nomatter and Eversmile will keep hopping over the Limpopo River from Masvingo.\n\nSouth Africa may be able to reduce the flow to a trickle, but it will not stop altogether as long as there is uneven development on the continent, and as long as freedom and democracy are practised only in breach.\n\nAs for foreign nationals living in South Africa, we have to accept that this is their home.\n\nVery few have any intention of returning to their countries of origin. (To be fair, who would want to leave a country that is home to the ever-conquering Orlando Pirates?)\n\nThe days of mass deportation are over \u2013 it is a pointless exercise. The starting point is to recognise the problem and talk about it openly.\n\nSo, could the perpetrators of PC tyranny please let others talk?", "description": "This lowly newspaperman generally has no problem with political correctness.
