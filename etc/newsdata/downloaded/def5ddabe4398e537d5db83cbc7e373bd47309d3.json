The term hasn\u2019t been met with warmth from gamers, usually seen as an excuse to release an unfinished product, with the promise of improvement later on.\n\nThe majority of games that offer a constant stream of new content fail to provide a meaningful reason to stick with an old game when new exciting experiences are out there. I want to shine a light on one of the few games that has managed to successfully use the live game model; benefiting both gamers and the developer. That game is Hitman 2.\n\nHitman 2 is a great game; the question is, why? Its story is convoluted and derivative; a lack of animated cut scenes leaves a rough mark on what is an overall polished game. What makes Hitman 2 the perfect example of a live game just so happens to be the same thing that make all Hitman games (Absolution excluded) so fun to play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the sandbox nature of the Hitman series that allows Hitman 2 to really shine. The series allows for an enormous amount of creativity, making almost anything a weapon. What Hitman 2 and its predecessor, Hitman (2016) did, was focus this sandbox freedom into a series of challenges, feats, and mission stories that retain a sense of creative freedom, but in a more purposeful way.\n\nSo much of what makes Hitman addictive to play is the satisfying feeling the player gets when 20 minutes of planning comes together in a fatal crescendo of death; still, you know what they say about best laid plans. There\u2019s nothing worse than seeing all your work fall apart, whether through your own doing or that of the artificial intelligence.\n\nAdding challenges takes that weight of the crescendo off of your shoulders, instead tasking you with the planning of the final outcome. Mission stories act both as set pieces and extra story content, allowing you to learn more about the motives of your targets. Mucking about is great fun but working toward something is better; this is the foundation of Hitman 2\u2019s success.\n\nThe roadmap builds on this foundation. For almost a year Hitman 2 has followed a monthly content roadmap, releasing a steady stream of quality content. From escalation missions that increase in difficulty with each playthrough, to elusive targets that require thought and discretion. This side content is reason enough to return to Hitman, but unlocking new items really takes the cake. These items can be purely cosmetic, like different costumes, but many are new weapons that make your deadly job slightly easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m an ardent supporter of single-player games. Recent releases like God of War and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man (both PlayStation 4 exclusives) have proven that story-focused games are going nowhere. Hitman 2 isn\u2019t a story-focused game, nor does it pretend to be; it knows what it is. Hitman 2 continues to be one of the best \u2018bang for your buck\u2019 games on the market. Pick it up and enjoy, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nBy reader Conor\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
