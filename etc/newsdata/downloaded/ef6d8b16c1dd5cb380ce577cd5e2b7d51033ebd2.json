The 66-year-old backbencher, who represents the Cotswolds, was knighted in 2018.\n\nIt is understood that the MP attempted to bring someone into the lounge who did not have a relevant pass and was understood to have then remonstrated with a member of staff. Security then intervened.\n\nA party spokesman said: \u201cThe incident was totally unacceptable. Geoffrey has been asked to leave conference and we are establishing all of the facts to see if further action is necessary. \u201cWe will always adopt a zero tolerance approach to any inappropriate behaviour towards our hardworking staff.\u201d\n\nClifton-Brown did not deny the reports, and told PA Media: \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing further to say about it. I don\u2019t want to comment on it, really.\u201d\n\nPA Media reported that a staff member guarding the door of the lounge, which is for international visitors to the event, said the incident was sparked by a disagreement. \u201cIt was a small misunderstanding,\u201d the man said.\n\nParamedics were in attendance and security staff shut down entrances and exits into the media lounge and covered the glass window leading into the lounge for about 30 minutes.\n\nIn a statement, Greater Manchester police said: \u201cAt around 1.45pm on Tuesday 1 October 2019, an attendee to the Conservative party conference attempted to enter the international lounge area of the conference without the relevant pass.\n\n\u201cSecurity staff intervened and resolved the situation without any breach of security occurring.\u201d", "description": "Police called after Geoffrey Clifton-Brown allegedly behaved in \u2018totally unacceptable\u2019 fashion", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7134e7fe11d435615ca0c9049833fa20fcd9eb68/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bce93afa9ddc94f76823233849485c7b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
