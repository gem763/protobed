Following on from 6.96% tumble on Wednesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $7,453.0.\n\nA relatively bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to a mid-morning intraday low $7,367.9 before finding support.\n\nBitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $7,193.23 and the 62% FIB of $7,245.\n\nFinding support in the late morning, Bitcoin struck an early afternoon intraday high $7,529.0.\n\nFalling short of the first major resistance level at $7,934.33, Bitcoin eased back to $7,400 levels and a particularly range-bound 2nd half of the day.\n\nFor the bulls, the extended bullish trend remained intact in spite of sliding back to sub-$8,000 levels. While falling back through the 38.2% FIB, Bitcoin continued to hold above the 62% FIB of 7,245.\n\nThe Rest of the Pack\n\nAcross the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed day for the crypto majors on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin Cash SV led the way with an 8.44% rally that reversed Wednesday\u2019s 7.1% loss.\n\nBinance Coin (1.68%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (1.44%), Stellar\u2019s Lumen (1.38%), and Ripple\u2019s XRP (1.30%) also made solid gains.\n\nWhile EOS (0.37%) and Litecoin (0.30%) managed to end the day in the green, Ethereum joined Bitcoin in the red, with a 1.08% loss.\n\nAfter a choppy couple of days, it\u2019s been a bearish week for the majority of the top 10. Bitcoin Cash SV bucks the trend in the current week, rising by 12.58%.\n\nFor the rest, Bitcoin (-9.78%), Litecoin (-9.64%), Ethereum (-8.44%), and Binance Coin (-8.34%) have seen the heaviest losses, Monday through Thursday.\n\nThrough the current week, the total crypto market cap rose to a Monday high $224.47bn before falling to a Wednesday low $202.69bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $205.66bn.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance slipped to 65% levels on Thursday after a trend-bucking loss on the day.\n\nThis Morning\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.11% to $7,460.9. A relatively range-bound start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from an early morning low $7,452.8 to a high $7,463.2.\n\nBitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin Cash SV led the way, rising by 1.63%. EOS (0.25%), Ripple\u2019s XRP (0.23%), Ethereum (0.17%), and Litecoin (0.14%) also saw green.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen (-0.46%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-0.28%) bucked the trend in the 1st hour of the day.\n\nFor the Bitcoin Day Ahead\n\nFor the day ahead, Bitcoin would need to avoid sub-$7,450 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $7,532.03.\n\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Thursday\u2019s high $7,529.\n\nBarring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the second major resistance level at $7,611.07.\n\nFailure to steer clear of sub-$7,450 levels could see Bitcoin see red for a 5th consecutive day.\n\nA fall back through to $7,300 levels would bring the first major support level at $7,370.93 into play.\n\nBarring an extended sell-off through the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of the 62% FIB of $7,245.\n\nIn the event of another broad-based crypto sell-off, the second major support level at $7,288.87 and 62% FIB would likely limit any further downside.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "It\u2019s a mixed start to the day as investors recover from Wednesday\u2019s sell-off.
