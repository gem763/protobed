The programme aired on Wednesday.\n\nChristine said: 'When we first walked into this house, it just offered something different and it was exciting.'\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Phil and Kirstie help transform the Purley bungalow - but do the owners decide to Love It and stay put, or List It and move to another property?\n\nTony Congdon and Christine Attwood bought the bungalow in Croydon 22 years ago\n\nA party house: The owners of the bungalow said it looked like a '1980s porn set'\n\nThe owners claim people said it was a 'swingers' house' following the addition of some pampas grass outside\n\nKirstie goes on to describe how the house from the outside looks like a 'normal' bungalow with a 'normal' looking lounge that has a curtain that\u2026opens onto a, er, swimming pool.'\n\nBasically the lounge is a swimming pool. It does really look like a 1980s porn set Owner, Christine Attwood\n\nChristine said: 'When we describe our house to people, we tell them that our lounge has a swimming pool in it. But basically the lounge is a swimming pool. It does really look like a 1980s porn set.\n\nTony added: 'And since you put that pampas grass outside, people have said it is a swingers' house.'\n\nPhil responded by commenting: 'With the 1980s pool, I can see where the confusion might have arisen.'\n\nUnexpected feature: A dated curtain divided the orange lounge and the swimming pool area\n\nGoodbye pool! The pool covered 710 square feet of living space and so Phil and Kirstie advised filling it in\n\nThe couple had originally bought the property as they wanted a party house - but were ready for a change\n\nChristine explains why she wants to move, saying that when she bought the property 'we decided we wanted a party house, but now we don't'.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony says he would like to stay at the property.\n\nThe pool covers 710 square feet of living space and so Phil and Kirstie fill it, reclaiming the lounge.\n\nPhil adds: 'I bet that [pool] has seen plenty of action. It is like Hugh Hefner's Surrey retreat this is.'\n\nThe bungalow in Purley, in the London borough of Croydon, where the average value of a home currently stands at \u00a3626,442\n\nIt is almost double the average for the country at a whole at \u00a3310,757.\n\nAt the beginning of the TV show, Phil says: 'The joys of Purley. It makes we think of that 70s sitcom Terry and June.\n\n'The middle-aged couple, move to suburbia, kids leave home, midlife-crisis ensures. It is a classic story.'\n\n'Do you think we'll have a mid-life crisis when our kids leave home?' Asks Kirstie.\n\n'I hope so, I have ready-made excuses for poor behaviour,' replies Phil.\n\nThe Purley couple sit with Kirstie and Phil to talk about how to transform the swimming pool area in their dated home\n\nThe finished product! The bungalow was given an overhaul that introduced a bright and modern living area\n\nThe programme sees the property renovated with the swimming pool filled to create a large living area.\n\nKirstie explains: 'This may have been the greatest transformation we have ever had.'\n\nThe renovation cost \u00a3150,000 and despite being impressed with the work, the couple decided to move instead.\n\nThe series continues Wednesday at 8pm on channel 4, with past episodes available to view on Channel 4's catch-up website My4.", "description": "The house and its colourful swimming pool featured in C4 television show 'Love It or List It', with Phil Spencer describing it as being ' like Hugh Hefner's Surrey retreat'.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/15/11/9857920-0-image-a-13_1550230428657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-16"}
