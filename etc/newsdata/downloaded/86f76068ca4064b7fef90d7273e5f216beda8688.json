Health officials say it was believed to have been caused by a water leak.\n\nSpellberg halted non-elective surgeries on Wednesday.\n\nHe says the hospital remains capable of disinfecting enough equipment to treat trauma cases.\n\nLos Angeles County-USC Medical Center is relatively new.\n\nIt was relocated from its old Depression-era building in 2008 to a new, $1.02-billion facility.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A huge Los Angeles hospital has put all elective surgeries on hold after discovering mold contamination in a room used to sterilize surgical equipment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
