Getty\n\nThe British government is now refusing to confirm there will be a special parliamentary sitting on Saturday to approve a Brexit deal, as it's unclear that the two sides can reach even in-principle agreement before a scheduled European Council summit of EU leaders on Thursday-Friday.\n\nHopes were raised last week after a productive meeting between Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar last Thursday. But there are now expectations that a deal might not be struck, if at all, until right before the legal Brexit deadline of October 31 - the date by which Mr Johnson has vowed to quit the EU \"come what may\".\n\nAnd that leaves up in the air the question of what Mr Johnson will do on October 19 - the date by which he is legally obliged (thanks to a law passed by opposition parties and Tory rebels) to seek a three-month delay to Brexit, unless he has a deal in his pocket.", "description": "Prospects seem to be fading that the two sides can get a deal done by this weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3695%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9dbba5c34bba220b71ada7d834b8fabbe1018319", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
