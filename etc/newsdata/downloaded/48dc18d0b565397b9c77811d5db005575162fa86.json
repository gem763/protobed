Elijah Cummings had died, President Donald Trump picked up his iPhone and tweeted a zinger at the impeachment effort the long-serving Democratic congressman was leading.\n\nTrump ally Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican congressman, had tweeted a slam on Democratic policies with a coda declaring they are 'desperate to impeach the President in a secret room in the basement of the Capitol.'\n\n'This is the real story. Thank you Jim!' Trump wrote.\n\nCummings, a senior Democrat who chaired the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was a key player in the Trump impeachment inquiry. Jordan is the ranking Republican committee member.\n\nCummings died at age 68 at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital at 2:45 a.m. on Thursday, his office said in a statement.\n\nAn hour after piling on the Democrats, Trump finally tweeted his respects.\n\n'My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings.

If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place,' Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\n'Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States,' Trump wondered in another tweet.\n\n'No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!'\n\nCummings responded that government officials must stop making 'hateful, incendiary comments' that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems.\n\nRep.
