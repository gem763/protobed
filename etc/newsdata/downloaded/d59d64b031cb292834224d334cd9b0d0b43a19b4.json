He was at the Olympic training center with \u2018Marty Fake Newsman.\u2019 He used to beat him, so I\u2019m hanging with this guy. You know \u2018Marty Fake Newsman\u2019 will be light work on Dec. 14.\u201d\n\nBut Covington said this wasn\u2019t an attempt to necessarily troll Usman. Their common collegiate background laid the groundwork.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history until he told me, but the history that I have with the guy is he also wrestled at Iowa Central, the same place that me, Jon Jones and Cain Velasquez came out of in college,\u201d Covington said. \u201cWe kind of have mutual friends and mutual contacts, so I was able to get in contact and we want to bring him out to American Top Team. We\u2019re looking to always improve our gym at American Top Team, and having a high level like him \u2013 he just made his first world team for the USA \u2013 and having that type of look in the room only ups everyone\u2019s level in the gym.\u201d\n\nCovington, a former interim welterweight champion, finally will get his crack at an undisputed title. He and Usman have identical pro MMA records, and have wins over common opponents Demian Maia and Rafael dos Anjos en route to the top of the ladder.\n\nIt may look like an evenly matched fight on paper, but Covington thinks he beats Usman wherever the fight goes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting this fight to be the easiest fight of my career,\u201d Covington said. \u201cThe guy, he can\u2019t hang with me in any department of mixed martial arts. He\u2019s a D-II wrestling scrub. His boxing and standup game is amateur at best. His jiu-jitsu is pathetic. I mean, I\u2019m better than him everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn his most recent outing, Covington put on arguably his best performance against former 170-pound champ Robbie Lawler at UFC on ESPN 5 in August. He stifled Lawler with relentless pace and pressure and broke the UFC record for most significant strikes attempted in a fight.\n\nCovington sees more of the same happening at UFC 245, except this time he doesn\u2019t think Usman will last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to knock him out inside three rounds,\u201d Covington said. \u201cTake that money to the bank if you guys want to make your bank accounts great again. He\u2019s getting finished. That chin is weak. He\u2019s been dropped in a lot of fights, and he don\u2019t have that good of a chin. When he finds out that he can\u2019t wrestle with me, he will be put stiff and unconscious on Dec. 14. and Colby \u2018Chaos\u2019 Covington will be the face of the UFC.\u201d", "description": "For his UFC 245 training camp, Colby Covington brought in wrestler Pat Downey \u2013\u00a0a man he says \"used to wipe the mats\" with Kamaru Usman.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/colby-covington-ufc-225-6.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
