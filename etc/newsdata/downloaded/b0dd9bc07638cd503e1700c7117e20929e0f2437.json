Under this mandate, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Westpac will be required to give consumers greater access to the information they hold on consumers as well as the power to require those banks to provide safe and secure access to that information to trusted third parties.\n\nIn August, the Australian government officially extended the CDR to include energy services to give consumers the chance to compare and easily switch energy providers. This was after the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC), which was tasked with implementing the CDR, announced in February that energy data would join the CDR mandate in early 2020.\n\nThe CDR for energy will initially apply only to the National Electricity Market, which excludes Western Australia and the Northern Territory, before it is expanded to other energy markets over time.\n\nThe ACCC is currently developing rules to accommodate energy-specific arrangements, including appropriate authorisation and authentication models, while continuing to consult with stakeholders on the next stages of the development of the CDR.\n\nIn March, ACCC released a draft document detailing the rules that would guide the implementation of the CDR.\n\nPrior to the release of the guidelines, the Australian Privacy Foundation said the CDR privacy safeguards were not sufficient, and that the government had \"severely\" underestimated the need for more thought across the entire legislative change.\n\nMeanwhile, Communications Alliance has been concerned that the legislation will not be overly applicable to industries other than banking, and that the rushed process will result in a disjointed framework that is not well thought out.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Submissions from industry and the public are being accepted until November 20.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/18/c110e6cd-3f39-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/a408a5d2784d1f3f1497d2636d7e549c/cert-australia-polls-businesses-on-cyber-incidents.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
