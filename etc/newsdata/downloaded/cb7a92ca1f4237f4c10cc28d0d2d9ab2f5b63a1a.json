Climate change poses a further risk.\n\nProtecting the cave is the most important priority, including limiting access to non-authorised personnel.\n\nImage copyright ZSL Image caption Bats flying around the cave\n\nBats are one of the most threatened group of animals due to destruction of their roosts, disease and even hunting, said Jose Manuel De La Cruz Mora, of conservation charity ZSL (Zoological Society of London), based at the Natural History Museum of Pinar del R\u00edo.\n\n\"It was time consuming giving each bat an individual manicure, but it's an incredible privilege to get up-close to this amazing animal - and to discover more about them made all those hours painting their nails worth it!\" he said.\n\nImage copyright ZSL Image caption Painting the nails, or claws, of the bats to help identify individuals\n\nIt is hoped the new data will allow the species to be listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, reflecting the urgent need for action to save it from extinction.\n\nThe bat quickly perishes when taken out of humid environments and has not survived in captivity.\n\nImage copyright CarolinaSotoNavarro_ZSL Image caption Cuban greater funnel-eared bat\n\nWhat do we know about the bat?\n\nThe Cuban greater funnel-eared bat (Natalus primus) is found in a single cave on the peninsula of Guanahacabibes in Western Cuba\n\nIt feeds on insects, including moths, crickets and beetles\n\nFunnel-eared bats are naturally vulnerable to extinction due to their specific habitat of hot caves\n\nClassified as an EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) species, losing the bat would represent the loss of millions of years of evolutionary history.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "description": "Scientists explore the home of a bat species that is confined to a single cave in Cuba.", "authors": ["Helen", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/27DB/production/_108530201_cubangreaterfunnel-earedbat2zsl.jpg"}
