This is one of four new vegan, silicone-free, 98% natural \u201csmoothies\u201d for hair.\n\n'I loved everything about this version for dry hair, from the \u201cgood enough to eat\u201d banana scent to the incredible silky, soft and shiny result it gave.\u2019\n\nBeauty ed Octavia says: \u2018It has a thick, butter texture so it really feels like it clings to damp hair and gets working.\n\n'After one use my ends went from noticeably dry to soft and nourished and my hair smelled like angels.\n\n'I love it.\u2019\n\nFashion stylist Lauren says: \u2018I have very dry, brittle hair.\n\n'This was intense enough to make it feel silky and soft and my red colour doesn\u2019t wash out as fast anymore - it looks more vibrant.\n\n'The only downside is I\u2019ve noticed is my hair is a bit more static when it\u2019s dry.\u2019\n\nBeauty writer Zoe says: \u2018Yes, it is expensive but you do get a very big tub and a de-tangling brush.\n\n'My hair felt softer than ever after 10 minutes wearing this (then brushing it through wet), but not at all weighed down or greasy.\n\n'The coconut smell is also amazing.\u2019\n\nBeauty writer Zoe says: \u2018It only had to be on my hair for 3-5 minutes, but it took a while to rinse all the mask out as it\u2019s really thick, and I felt there was some residue coating my hair.\n\n'It felt soft but not as clean as usual.\n\n'I think it\u2019s just too heavy for my fine lengths.\u2019\n\nBeauty writer Zoe says: \u2018Newly reformulated with \u201cadvanced strengthening\u201d ingredients, this is for the 67% of us who routinely damage our hair with colouring and chemicals.\n\n'I\u2019ve used this a few times now and I\u2019ve noticed less hair comes out when brushing, and it feels very healthy and shiny after I leave it on for 10 mins in the shower.\u2019\n\nReader tester Lisa says: \u2018Usually on the day of washing, my hair is poofy, but it was more manageable after using this.\n\n'It has hemp seed extract, which is high in omega oils, so gave my lengths a soft feel.\n\n'It comes with a cap that you wear for 10 mins once hair is towel-dried and the mask is applied.\n\n'Nice, but not the most conditioning one I\u2019ve tried.\u2019\n\nFeatures ed Emma says: \u2018The deep conditioning of a mask with the added bonus of a subtle tint.\n\n'There are rose gold, auburn and champagne versions (as well as a blue!), but I tried the cocoa, which was great for giving my mid-brunette hair a richer tone.\n\n'It felt like I\u2019d just had a glossy treatment when I blow-dried it.\u2019\n\nBeauty director Lynne says: \u2018The big sell of this product is that it only takes 60 seconds, but \u2013 like any prenup \u2013 you need to check the small print carefully.\n\n'A close squint at the bottle recommends you actually leave it on 2-3 mins if you want \u201cdeep conditioning\u201d (and for \u00a327 I\u2019d want max effects.)\n\n'It did leave my hair reasonably silky, but it wasn\u2019t SO amazing I\u2019d be prepared to pay this much for it.\u2019\n\nBeauty writer Zoe says: \u2018I have extensions that can get very dry, so I need a thick mask.\n\n'This was nice, as the coconut formula made it easy to brush out tangles and made my ends feel smoother.\n\n'The smell was amazing as well, but the best part is it only needs to sit on your hair for three minutes, so I could do the mask while I showered.\u2019", "description": "These are the conditioning treatments promising shiny, healthy hair after the first use", "authors": ["Zoe Cripps", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14119704.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Clients-hair-is-being-reconditioned.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
