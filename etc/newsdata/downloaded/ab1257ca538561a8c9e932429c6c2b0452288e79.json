It exhibits a paternal dimension in country after otherwise unrelated country.\n\nTo observe these connections is not to imply that populist politicians are consciously plucking the notes of paternity in a post-revolutionary world of vanished fathers and absent brothers. But it is to say that the tacit demand of citizens for masculine protectors seems to be ensuring a steady supply of leaders who find ways to be that figure\u2014whether or not they consciously understand the elemental need out there.\n\nDaddy issues might begin at home. But these days, they\u2019re they\u2019re out in the streets\u2014including in a growing number of Western capitals.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mary Eberstadt", "Theamericanconservative.Com Articles Understanding-The-Pop-In-Populism"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
