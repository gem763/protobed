He cited International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that \u00a317 trillion of new investment in energy production is needed by 2040, representing a \u201ccompelling investment case\u201d for fossil fuels.\n\nShell said in a statement it had set out an \u201cambition\u201d to halve net carbon emissions by 2050 \u201cin step with society as it moves towards meeting the aims of Paris\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need,\u201d a spokesperson added.\n\nBP insisted its strategy to produce low cost and low carbon oil and gas was in line with the IEA\u2019s forecasts and the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u201cAll of this is aimed at evolving BP from an oil and gas focused company to a much broader energy company so that we are best equipped to help the world get to net zero while meeting rising energy demand,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nBut the Carbon Tracker report found big oil and gas companies spent at least 30 per cent of their investment last year on projects that are inconsistent with plans to limit global warming even to 1.6C.\n\n\u201cThese projects represent an imminent challenge for investors and companies looking to align with climate goals,\u201d it warned.\n\nCarbon Tracker\u2019s calculations were based on three scenarios produced by the Paris-based IEA models of oil and gas supply under different warming pathways.\n\nWith fossil fuel supply on course to outstrip demand if the world limits warming at 1.5C, the report assumed the projects with the lowest production costs would be the most competitive. It said \u201cpursuing higher-cost projects risks creating stranded assets that will never deliver adequate returns\u201d.", "description": "Major oil and gas companies have approved \u00a340bn of projects since last year that undermine global efforts to avert a\u00a0climate crisis, a report has revealed.
