They are, but they\u2019re the hand-drawn type. Which is kind of fun. Start with an eye primer \u2013 it creates a velvety canvas. Post priming, makeup artist Peter Philips covered the entire upper lid with an intense inky black liner (go hard or go home and all that), scrawled spider legs along the lower lash line and finished with lashings of everything-proof mascara. That\u2019s it. Actually it\u2019s not. You\u2019ll also need a steady hand.\n\n1. Anastasia Beverly Hills Eyeliner, \u00a321, beautybay.com\n\n2.

This kit will soothe it\n\nThere are parallels with the condition of my skin and toddler behaviour. When it\u2019s good, it is beautiful to look at and one could bathe in the flurry of compliments. When it is bad, it is difficult, exasperating and a pain in the proverbial. That\u2019s the toddler moment my skin has been having of late that no amount of makeup can disguise. Unearthing the culprit is a process of elimination. Changed your life, products, or diet of late? It was an excessive coffee spell that left me with beastly breakouts and cavernous pores. So while weaning myself off caffeine (God help me), I began using Medik8\u2019s excellent blemish range. The Clarifying Foam is an antibacterial wonder that cleanses, unclogs pores and exfoliates. Don\u2019t be alarmed by the word foam \u2013 it barely musters a lather. Additionally, it is non-stripping, non-drying and non-irritating. My standout product, however, is the clear and efficacious blemish gel that you dab on problem areas. It decongests pores, balances oil and diminishes blemishes while acting as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor (particularly useful for darker skin tones). I followed this with the oil-free moisturiser and my skin was back to normal in record time. Alas, I don\u2019t think it works for bad-tempered toddlers.

Super wearable, excellent pigments and eco-conscious, it\u2019s impossible not to love.
