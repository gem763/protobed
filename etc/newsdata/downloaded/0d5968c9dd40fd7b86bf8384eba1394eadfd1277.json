The minute that a female athlete comes on, Dina Asher-Smith, Katerina Johnson-Thompson, the squad all get excited because that is their inspiration,\" Neville said on Friday.\n\n\"They\u2019re fighting together. That\u2019s inspiring for them. The gold medal that Johnson-Thompson won \u2013 they have a different sensation. The minute that someone like Gabby Logan comes on the telly there is an admiration that she has broken down so many barriers to get to be the person at the BBC that goes on MOTD and does the athletics.", "description": "England's squad have been taking inspiration from Great Britain's world champion athletes ahead of their sold-out Brazil friendly at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday.", "authors": ["Molly Mcelwee", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211968404-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvCxxheLDkBlTi5VZTe6ZQ89Iv_uN_InXb_1qmkUzt8E.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
