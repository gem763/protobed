We only have three scrumhalves here so we want to make sure that he rather has more recovery time. So, hopefully on Monday he is also ready to go.\"\n\n\n\nIn the worst case scenario, Erasmus said Pienaar would board a plane to Japan.\n\n\n\n\"I know Ruan Pienaar is currently playing very well back home. The difficult thing for the guys who were in our mix in South Africa is that there is no Currie Cup rugby now, whereas the PRO14 guys are actually playing now.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Pienaar is vastly experienced, having played 88 Tests between 2006 and 2015, and was instrumental in the Cheetahs' recent Currie Cup triumph.\n\nThe coach added that Kolbe, who injured his ankle against Italy last Friday and missed the win over Canada, should be available for the quarter-finals.\n\n\"There's a very good chance - I'd say 80 to 90% - that he will be available (for the quarter-final).\"\n\nThe Springboks will face either Japan, Ireland or Scotland in the quarter-finals.\n\n- Compiled by Herman Mostert", "description": "Ruan Pienaar has been placed on standby in case one of the three No 9's in the Springbok Rugby World Cup squad is ruled out with injury.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7779/3b15ef9900cc45a5bbc593065c327f19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
