This method involved zeroing in on those stocks whose prices are varying within a narrow band.\n\nIf the price of the stock falls below this channel, it could be the best time to sell it off. However, the best time to buy a stock as per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band. Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains.\n\nZeroing in on Breakout Stocks\n\nIn order to select the right breakout stock one has to first calculate its support and resistance level. A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period.\n\nIn other words, the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level, which means most traders are willing to sell it. At the resistance level, most traders are willing to go long on the stock, which means that they would like to add them to their portfolio. The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level.\n\nHas a Breakout Really Occurred?\n\nThe primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed. When a stock moves above the resistance level, it should be a highly prized commodity for traders. However, whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether.\n\nFor a bona fide breakout, the stock\u2019s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level. This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long-term price trends. The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study. Despite the risk of misidentification, correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns, even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\n\u2022 Percentage price change over four weeks between 10% and 20% (Stocks which are showing considerable price increases, but whose gains are not excessive.)\n\n\u2022 Current Price /52-Week High greater than or equal to 0.9 (Stocks which are trading 90% close to their 52-week highs.)\n\n\u2022 Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\n\n\u2022 Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2\n\n(Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit.)\n\n\u2022 Current price less than or equal to $20 (Stocks which are reasonably priced.)\n\nThese criteria narrow down the universe of over 7091stocks to only 14.\n\nHere are five of the 14 stocks that passed the screen:\n\nDigital Turbine, Inc.
