She was speaking at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles\n\nCouric began by tackling Sandberg on Facebook's fake news policies and how 'secret groups' posting misleading content would be prevented with a presidential election in 2020.\n\nShe asked: 'Why did Facebook announce not to fact check political ads last month? The Rand Corporation actually has a term for this, ''truth decay''.\n\n'Mark [Zuckerberg] himself has defended this decision even as the press have expressed concerns about the erosion of truth online. What is the rationale for that?'\n\nSandberg replied that political ads do not make the company much money.\n\nShe said: 'It's not for the money, let's start there. This is a very small part of our revenue. It's very small, very small. And it is very controversial. We're not doing this for the money.\n\n'We take political ads because we really believe they are part of political discourse,' Sandberg added.\n\n'If you look at this over time, the people who have most benefited from being able to run ads are people who are not covered by the media so they can get their message out.'\n\nSandberg stated that Facebook would be introducing an ad labeling system, saying each spot would be verified and identified by who paid for the placement.\n\nInterviewer Katie Couric pushed Sheryl Sandberg to address what measures Facebook has taken to protect elections\n\n.@KatieCouric asks Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg: \u201cHow worried are you about your personal legacy, as a result of your association with this company?\u201d pic.twitter.com/6IJhNYoZZx \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) October 22, 2019\n\nShe also made a point of stating that if 'something is hate or bullying, it comes down' but if something is fake, 'We don't take it off'.\n\n'It is the price of free speech. That means there is going to be all the beauty and all the ugliness of humanity... We are going to fight to keep the bad off but keep the good going,' Sandberg said.\n\nCouric then questioned whether Sandberg's book 'put too much onus on women to change' rather than corporations to alter their workplace culture.\n\nShe asked: 'Given the systemic failures of so many organizations that we've seen, who have tolerated sexual misconduct and harassment, silenced women through NDAs, do you think, in retrospect, given the very real revelations that have surfaced as a result of the MeToo movement, ''Lean In'' might have put too much of the onus on women to change, instead of getting a lot of these screwed-up companies to change?'\n\nSandberg then told the stunned audience: 'If you read, actually read, what we've written and the work my foundation has done, what we've always said is that we want it to be OK for women to be ambitious, and we want companies to change. It has to be both.'\n\nThe interview went on with Couric challenging Sandberg over Mark Zuckerberg's proposal to protect users from fake news.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaking at Georgetown University last week. He has pledged to tackle fake news on the platform in the run up to next year's presidential election\n\nCouric asked whether she believed a team of 35,000 new Facebook content monitors would be able to manage the posts from 2.2 billion active users.\n\n'The moderators are looking for content, the engineers are looking for fake accounts. That's the only way to find [them],' Sandberg said.\n\n'We're taking down millions of fake accounts per day,' Sandberg stated.\n\nBut Couric was still on the attack and was presented with a quote from Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer who resigned in 2018.\n\n'My real fear is that in 2020, it is going to be the battle of the billionaires, of secret groups working for people aligned on both sides, who are trying to manipulate us at scale, online,' Couric quoted Stamos.\n\n'What is Facebook doing to defend the platform against this kind of domestic threat?'\n\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testifying before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign influence on social media last September. She told Katie Couric yesterday that the platform did not make much money from political ads\n\nSandberg said that Facebook's transparency is changing and noted that content pages will now receive geotags identifying their origin points whether they like it or not.\n\nInterviewer Couric proceeded to challenge Sandberg, claiming Facebook operated with a double-standard which apply to professional news organizations but not their own platform.\n\nCouric highlighted a quote written by Vanita Gupta, the former head of the DOJ's civil rights arm.\n\n'Simply put, while major news organizations strengthen fact-checking and accountability, Facebook is saying if you are a politician who wishes to peddle in lies, distortion and not-so-subtle racial appeals, welcome to our platform.\n\n'We will not fact-check. You are automatically newsworthy. You are automatically exempt from scrutiny,' Gupta's quote read.\n\nSandberg responded by insisting that damaging posts promoting hate, violence and terror are removed.\n\n'It's really not about ads. It's about content on the platform. Hate, violence, terror. It immediately comes down.'", "description": "Sheryl Sandberg's comments come as Facebook fends off mounting criticism of its practices.
