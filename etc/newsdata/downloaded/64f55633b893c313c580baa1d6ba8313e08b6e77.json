Of the 2.1 million total, about 138,000 are in Maryland, 120,000 in Virginia and 37,000 in the District.\n\nCalifornia has the most, about 170,000, followed by Florida, 151,000, Texas, 143,000, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nWhile benefits under both systems are based on salary and length of service, the CSRS formula is more generous; as of last October, its average retiree\u2019s monthly annuity was $3,781 compared to $1,506 under FERS.\n\nAt the start of this year, retirees under the CSRS system received a 2.8 percent boost while those eligible for COLAs under the FERS system received 1.8 percent.\n\nAD\n\nThe COLA boost also will apply to survivor beneficiaries under both CSRS and FERS, where the average monthly benefits were $1,646 and $596, respectively, as of last October.\n\nAD\n\nThe inflation adjustment meanwhile will raise the average monthly Social Security benefit nationwide to $1,503.\n\nThe FERS system includes Social Security, plus employer contributions toward the 401(k)-style Thrift Savings Plan, to help make up for its less generous basic benefits formula. Some CSRS retirees do qualify for Social Security through other work, although those benefits commonly are subject to an offset that can decrease their value by hundreds of dollars a month.\n\nAD\n\nThe government announced last week that the enrollee share of premiums will increase by 5.6 percent on average in January in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program that covers most federal retirees as well as current employees.\n\nIn the largest plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield standard option, the monthly premium will increase by $40.14 to $621.27 for self-plus-one coverage, a common enrollment type for married retirees who have no children eligible for coverage. FEHBP enrollees may change plans in the annual open season that will run Nov. 11 to Dec. 9.\n\nAD\n\nThe COLA adjustment applies only to retirees. Raises for current employees are decided in the federal budget process, which still is ongoing for 2020.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump recently supported a 2.6 percent across-the-board raise for federal employees in January 2020, reversing his earlier call for a freeze. A Senate committee then effectively endorsed that figure by taking no position. The House has voted for an average 3.1 percent boost, with the increase varying by locality.\n\nTrump earlier this year proposed ending the inflation adjustments under the FERS program and cutting a half percentage point off adjustments for those retired under CSRS. However, there has been no action in Congress on that proposal.\n\nAD", "description": "The average monthly Social Security benefit will rise to $1,503.
