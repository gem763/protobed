If I was still sitting in the stands watching them I\u2019d be like \u2018oh my God\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn your career, opportunities will come along the way to get more first-team football, but I know I\u2019m not missing out on anything because I see what Jurgen [Klopp] tells the players, he speaks to me one-to-one, tells me what I need to improve on. I know he\u2019s got faith in me.\n\n\u201cBeing a local lad, my head\u2019s only ever been on staying here to represent the area and show what local boys are capable of.\u201d", "description": "The veteran Liverpool midfielder made sure 18-year-old rising star Jones is keeping his feet on the ground", "authors": ["Alex Harris", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20385065.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MK-Dons-v-Liverpool-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round-Stadium-MK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
