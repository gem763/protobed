We remain prepared to leave without a deal on Oct. 31.\"\n\nThe Sunday Times newspaper reported that Johnson, the face of Britain's 2016 campaign to leave the EU, was now \"desperate\" to secure a deal after security chiefs warned that leaving in a disorderly manner could inflame tensions in Northern Ireland.\n\nIreland has proved the toughest nut to crack in the Brexit talks, specifically how to prevent the British province of Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor into the EU's markets without having border controls.\n\nIreland fears controls on the 500-km (300-mile) border with Northern Ireland would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended three decades of sectarian and political conflict that killed more than 3,600 people.\n\nJohnson is likely to talk to senior EU leaders on Monday to reassess the situation, the source said.
