We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, one of three Republicans running against President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination, said Friday that the president is \u201cgiving the country the middle finger\u201d by asking the Ukrainian president to look into his Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nWalsh argued that the GOP needs a \"gut-check\" after House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump over his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the president urged Zelenskyto work with Rudy Giuliani about opening an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter. The call is at the center of a declassified whistleblower complaint released Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this president, and this is a serious thing to say, doesn\u2019t give a damn about this country,\u201d Walsh told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar. He added that \u201call Donald Trump cares about is Donald Trump, and this (Trump) phone call, what we learned this week makes it clear.\"\n\n\"It's clear that this President, and this is a serious thing to say, doesn't give a damn about this country.\"\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Joe @WalshFreedom reacts to the latest whistleblower developments and Trump's July call with Ukraine.https://t.co/SxUZqcTBeUpic.twitter.com/FmUjxlDy2G \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 27, 2019\n\nHe continued that \u201cto put it quite simply, we have a president who doesn\u2019t have any respect for the rule of law, he doesn\u2019t have any respect for truth, and he\u2019s got no guardrails.\u201d\n\n\"If there\u2019s one issue, Brianna, that has been eating at this country for the last three years, it\u2019s foreign interference in our election,\" Walsh stated. \"And here\u2019s the president of the United States just a couple months ago on this call \u2013 it\u2019s quite literally like he\u2019s giving his middle finger to the American people. \u2018I don\u2019t care about that. I\u2019m going to ask another government to interfere in our 2020 election. I dare you to come get me.\u2019 He\u2019s giving the country the middle finger and Republicans better understand that.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, again, acting like some sort of mob boss, he thinks everything is about him and it\u2019s not about the country,\u201d Walsh added.\n\nWalsh defended the whistleblower, saying they should be \"praised and revered\" by Americans after Trump said the source was \u201calmost a spy\u201d and suggested the culprit had committed treason.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/27/joe-walsh-trump-giving-country-middle-finger/3793547002/", "description": "Former Rep.
