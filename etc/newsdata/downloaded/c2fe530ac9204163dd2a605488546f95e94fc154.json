We have the means and the ability to do so.\"\n\nHe added: \"The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated.\n\n\"It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer.\n\n\"It means that we are preparing to ensure that, if no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\"\n\nBoris Johnson still faces a knife-edge vote, with only a few MPs in play one way or the other, on whether to approve the Brexit deal he won with Brussels.\n\nLabour and the DUP rejected the deal for creating a customs border down the Irish Sea and watering down pledges on workers' rights.\n\nBut a handful of Labour backbenchers were won over after the PM made a non-legally-binding promise to improve workers' rights later down the line.\n\nAnd hard Brexiteer Tory 'Spartans' have mostly been won over with the promise the deal can \"get Brexit done\".\n\nMinisters will try to hold a \"meaningful vote\" tomorrow on the Brexit deal to give a clear indication which way it will go.\n\nThen on Tuesday they will start debating the full-blown Withdrawal Agreement Bill that encodes it into law.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons.\n\n\"A lot of people say 'Get this done and move on'.\"\n\nFormer Cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who quit the Tory whip, said she would back Mr Johnson's deal.\n\nAnd so did Oliver Letwin, the ousted Tory who led yesterday's successful bid to delay the October 31 Brexit date.", "description": "Michael Gove led an urgent meeting and claimed Operation Yellowhammer is being 'triggered' - though he didn't explain what that'll actually mean", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658888.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-Chancellor-of-the-Duchy-of-Lancaster-Michael-Gove-leaves-the-Houses-of-Parliament-as-parli.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
