However, it\u2019s a question that the Supreme Court has already said it would address in arguments this fall, so why is Trump bringing it up now? Here\u2019s a hint \u2014 who came back to work this week in Washington?\n\nThe Immigration Law Institute\u2019s Christopher Hajec says, \u201cThe Supreme Court has to look st whether DACA is lawful. What they are looking at now is whether Trump\u2019s recision of DACA is lawful. Must consider lawfulness of DACA itself. Looks very odd that President Trump doesn\u2019t\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\n\u2026.President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA, and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event, how can he have the right to sign and I don\u2019t have the right to \u201cunsigned.\u201d Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nThat has been the primary argument over Trump\u2019s attempts to close out the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, created by Barack Obama through executive order. The EO directed immigration officials and prosecutors to use their discretion not to pursue deportation cases against children brought into the country illegally as long as they stayed in school and didn\u2019t break other laws. A parallel program aimed at protecting the parents, DAPA, got shot down by federal courts because it went further than prosecutorial discretion and allowed parents to get work permits in violation of federal law. EOs cannot override statute, but the president can direct prosecutorial priorities.\n\nThe issue with DACA is that it\u2019s not statutory, which \u2014 theoretically, anyway \u2014 means any succeeding president can impose his/her own prosecutorial discretion in the same manner. Trump tried that by issuing countermanding EOs, which courts have blocked through some legal sophistry. The basic question comes down to this: if Obama could legally do this through an EO, then Trump can legally undo it the same way. If Trump can\u2019t undo it with an EO, then Obama couldn\u2019t legally do it in the first place without congressional action, which then makes DACA illegal anyway. Thus far, courts have instead opted for outcome-based decisions which necessarily impede presidential authority, but only for some presidents.\n\nIt\u2019s untenable, and the Supreme Court has already agreed to cut through the nonsense to get to that question. Arguments will be heard in the comings weeks to unwind the mess. Nothing much has changed since then, except that Congress returned to work this week. And so \u2026\n\nDACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn\u2019t feel he had the legal right to sign \u2013 he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nPresident Trump suggested Friday that if he prevails in a Supreme Court case next term he would be open to a bipartisan deal in Congress on the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation. \u2026 Since his administration\u2019s move to scuttle the program in 2017, Trump at times has said he would like to find a way to protect those in the program. But attempts to work out a political compromise have foundered amid the larger partisan debate over immigration and border security. Democrats are likely to view Trump\u2019s latest overture skeptically.\n\nWell, at least until the Supreme Court rules on it. It\u2019s still tough to predict what will happen this fall on this question, but it will at least finally end the legislative status quo on immigration policy. At one point, Democrats appeared ready to cut a deal with Trump to swap a statutory replacement for DACA for border-wall funding and some reforms on asylum. After the courts intervened to keep DACA in place, though, the pressure to make a deal evaporated.\n\nThe best thing the Supreme Court can do in this instance is to get the judiciary out of the way. If they rule in Trump\u2019s favor, Democrats will find themselves under tremendous pressure to get a DACA fix in place before the next election \u2014 and before the DoJ and DHS start enforcing the law under Trump\u2019s EO. Trump is reminding them that he\u2019s willing to cut a deal, and that maybe it would be better to start now rather than wait until Trump might have the upper hand. Assuming he wins at the Supreme Court, of course.", "description": "\"... a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trump-schumer-mcconnell-pelosi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
