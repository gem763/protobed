It read \u201cMacron polluter of the earth\u201d, with the word \u2018champion\u2019 crossed out.\n\nSome demonstrators held an unauthorized march to Bastille square in the early evening.\n\nThe largely peaceful climate rally was marked by brief confrontations between police and masked demonstrators.\n\nSmall groups wearing black clothing associated with the \u201cblack bloc\u201d anarchist movement formed barricades, set fire to bins and bicycles, and threw paint over the front of a bank.\n\nSimilar skirmishes occurred later in the march with the prefecture again attributing violence to black blocs. Police responded with tear gas.\n\nThe authorities had deployed a massive police presence as it feared yellow-vest and black-bloc activists would take advantage of the climate change march and a separate protest over pension reform.\n\nSome 7,500 police were mobilized, several districts including the Champs-Elysees were made out-of-bounds for protests, and over 30 metro stations closed.\n\nPolice had made 163 arrests in Paris by late afternoon and earlier in the day pushed back around one hundred protesters who gathered on the Champs-Elysees shopping avenue, the Paris police prefecture said.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThere were further confrontations on the Champs-Elysees in the evening, with news channels showing clouds of tear gas and the fire brigade putting out a small fire.\n\nThe yellow vests, named after motorists\u2019 high-visibility jackets, were holding a 45th consecutive Saturday of action. The movement emerged late last year, triggered by fuel tax rises and swelling into a revolt against Macron\u2019s style of government.\n\nSome of their protests have been marked by rioting, partly blamed on black blocs.", "description": "Climate protesters marched through Paris for a second day on Saturday in a rally that saw sporadic clashes between masked demonstrators and police who also broke up \"yellow vest\" groups trying to stage unauthorized gatherings in the capital.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432317124&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0B6", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
