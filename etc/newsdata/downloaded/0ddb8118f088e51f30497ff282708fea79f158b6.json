Regulations require so-called Chinese walls between such business units to prevent the sharing of privileged information.\n\nThe bank unloaded shares at two earlier fundraising rounds when the WeWork mega-investor SoftBank gave employees and early investors a chance to tender shares, the person said. Selling a stake can be seen as prudent risk management or a sign the firm has grown pessimistic about a company's prospects.\n\nGoldman also assigned a \"much more modest\" value to the company than WeWork's $47 billion valuation, the person said on Tuesday.\n\nThe firm's investment bankers, meanwhile, were angling for a mandate on the IPO by suggesting to WeWork executives that it could fetch a public-market valuation of between $61 billion and $96 billion, the Financial Times reported. Those values were based on WeWork's revenue projections, according to a second person who has knowledge of the pitch.\n\nBanks like Goldman typically look for ways to work with hot tech startups before highly anticipated IPOs and then highlight those relationships and commitments when they pitch for the public float. That can take the form of small ownership stakes or lending commitments.\n\nA Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment.\n\nGoldman reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, announcing an $80 million write-down on the value of its WeWork stake. That represented a more than 50% cut to its midyear valuation. At the end of September, the bank estimated its investment to be worth $70 million, still above where it acquired it.\n\nThe write-down was much smaller than what Betsy Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst, predicted last week. Graseck said she expected Goldman to mark down its stake by $264 million in the third quarter based on an estimate of the size of the bank's stake, which she pegged at 1.4%.\n\nThe gap is most likely because Graseck didn't know, or couldn't have known, that Goldman had shrunk its stake, the person said.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs says it absorbed an $80 million write-down after WeWork's IPO disaster\n\nIt's unclear what valuation Goldman Sachs assigned to WeWork to come up with the value of its minority stake, but executives have said in the past that they tend to rely on observable events, such as fundraising rounds and sales. The firm also overlays a liquidity discount to make up for the fact that a stake can't be easily sold.\n\nThe last time WeWork raised money was in January, when SoftBank acquired shares at a $47 billion valuation. The company also purchased stock from employees and investors at a $23 billion valuation, giving it a blended valuation of $36 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited anonymous sources.\n\nGoldman acquired its investment in WeWork during a series of fundraising rounds going back to at least 2014, according to the FT.\n\nWeWork chose Goldman and JPMorgan as its lead underwriters in August.\n\nWeWork shelved its IPO last month and withdrew its prospectus after investors raised questions about the coworking firm's business model and conflict-of-interest concerns with founder and former CEO Adam Neumann.\n\n\n\nThe company is now in talks with JPMorgan, which is also an investor and lender to Neumann and the company, to raise as much as $5 billion and cover an expected cash crunch later this year.
