The counties are part of a mammoth federal case brought by more than 2,500 cities, counties, Native American tribes and others.\n\nThe long-awaited showdown pits the counties against seven drug companies: manufacturers Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals; distributors McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and Henry Schein; and retailer Walgreens. Walgreens has been sued only over the conduct of its internal system of warehousing and distributing opioids to its retail stores \u2014 not for the way its pharmacists dispensed them.\n\nThe new arguments reveal little that has not emerged during nearly two years of pretrial jousting, but they help define the outlines of the upcoming trial. The parties were required to file the legal papers by Wednesday.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of health conglomerate Johnson & Johnson, argued in its filing that it could not be held responsible for sparking the worst drug crisis in the nation\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cJanssen\u2019s medications did not cause or contribute to that crisis,\u201d wrote lawyers for the subsidiary. \u201cJanssen\u2019s medications had among the lowest rates of abuse and diversion of any [potentially abused] prescription opioid on the market. Nor can plaintiffs blame the crisis on Janssen\u2019s marketing.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Walgreens asserted the counties \u201ccannot show that any conduct by Walgreens resulted in the diversion of prescription opioid medications that could have caused the harms that plaintiffs allege.\u201d\n\nThe two counties are test cases in the consolidated lawsuit that accuses the drug companies of responsibility for overdose deaths and addiction that allegedly resulted from their handling of prescription painkillers.\n\nThey have accused the companies of creating a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d that harmed the health of residents of the two counties, and allege some of them operated in concert, in much the same way as an illegal drug gang would. Other charges include civil conspiracy and violation of Ohio\u2019s corrupt practices law.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have died of overdoses from prescription narcotics since 1999, according to government data.\n\nAll the local trials have been placed before a federal judge in Ohio, who chose the two counties as \u201cbellwether\u201d plaintiffs in an effort to determine how other lawsuits might fare.\n\nOther drug companies have settled with the counties, or been dropped from the first trial by mutual agreement. Most notably, Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin that is widely blamed for fueling the crisis, is attempting to fashion a $10 billion to $12 billion settlement with the federal plaintiffs and attorneys general from nearly every state that has sued the company and its owners, the Sackler family.\n\nAs it did in a recent case in Oklahoma, Johnson & Johnson contends that its two opioid products, Duragesic and Nucynta ER, made up less than 1 percent of the prescription opioid market in Summit and Cuyahoga counties.\n\nThe company also noted that Duragesic, a fentanyl painkiller delivered over 72 hours via a skin patch, is much more difficult to abuse than pills. \u201cThe Duragesic patch and Nucynta ER consistently ranked among the least abused and diverted opioid products \u2014 in Ohio or anywhere else,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nJohnson & Johnson lost the Oklahoma case in August, when a judge ordered it to contribute $572 million toward the costs of addressing the drug crisis. Judge Thad Balkman said that sum covers a single year of what the company is responsible for.\n\nWalgreens said it will show at trial that \u201cits distribution centers always followed appropriate protocols for monitoring suspicious orders, reporting them to [the Drug Enforcement Administration] and evaluating whether they should be shipped.\u201d Under federal law and regulations, distributors \u2014 the wholesalers who move painkillers from manufacturers to dispensers \u2014 are responsible for flagging orders that indicate possible diversion of drugs to the streets and notifying the DEA.\n\nMcKesson, the nation\u2019s largest drug distributor, said in its filing that it would \u201cintroduce evidence establishing that it complied with DEA\u2019s shifting guidance regarding suspicious orders.\u201d\n\nTeva said the counties cannot prove a causal link between drug sales by the company or its subsidiaries and any harms to Cuyahoga or Summit residents. \u201cAt trial, the counties will not be able to present testimony showing a single false statement that any Teva or Actavis Generic defendant made to a single prescriber in the counties; a single county doctor who was misled by anything that they said or did; or a single patient who was harmed because of a false statement,\u201d company lawyers wrote.\n\nAs lawyers zero in on drug companies, a reckoning may be coming\n\nJohnson & Johnson ordered to pay $572 million for its role in Oklahoma\u2019s opioid crisis\n\n76 billion opioid pills: Newly released federal data unmasks the epidemic", "description": "Plaintiffs and defendants focus on the reasons a jury should \u2014 or should not \u2014 hold drug companies responsible for overdose deaths, addiction and other harms.", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Sxstekj1LLQOs-k8PHiQ8m5nBY4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HRVWZPG7XEI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
