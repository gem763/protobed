Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh took part in Tuesday's unsanctioned GOP primary debate, which not only didn\u2019t feature the president, but didn't even have the third candidate running in the primary, Mark Sanford, who sat out the festivities to campaign in Iowa.\n\nThe event, hosted by Business Insider, took place Tuesday night in New York City.\n\nJulius Constantine Motal/AP\n\nWhile Trump may not have been in the room, he still dominated the night, as Walsh and Weld spent the majority of their time on stage peppering the president over issues ranging from impeachment, to tweets, to immigration. At one point the former congressman bluntly pivoted away from talking policy to declare: \u201cIt's not about the issues, it's about Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not debating Bill Weld,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThe problem is an unfit president in the White House who took a divided country and is it is dividing that.\u201d\n\nIt also didn\u2019t take long for both candidates to throw their support behind the newly announced impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cLet me start like this. The president of the United States will be impeached very, very soon. The president of the United States will deserve to be impeached very, very soon,\u201d Walsh said during his opening statement.\n\nWeld echoed Walsh\u2019s eagerness to see the president impeached, saying, \u201cI think it's a nightmare for Donald Trump, and he has no way of stopping it before the election.\"\n\nAnd when the conversation veered toward policy, Walsh reiterated that he launched his candidacy for one reason alone: \u201cIt's not about the issues, it's about Trump.\u201d\n\nMark Kauzlarich/Reuters\n\nWhile the debate saw Walsh and Weld get an opportunity to share an alternate vision of a party that\u2019s been consumed by Trump and Trumpism, it mostly featured the pair targeting the president, at times dipping into the same ad hominem attacks they were decrying.\n\n\u201cLet's just be clear, let's not mince words. Donald Trump is a horrible human being,\u201d said Walsh, who has acknowledged that he himself has made racist comments on Twitter, for which he recently apologized. \u201cOnly a very broken political system and a very divided country would produce that.\u201d\n\nTuesday's GOP debate began just hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced House Democrats were moving forward on impeachment amid swirling questions around a formal complaint filed by a whistle-blower over a phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president that suggested Trump had pushed him to investigate former vice president and current political rival Joe Biden.\n\nTrump campaign officials declined to comment following Tuesday night\u2019s debate, and have remained unconcerned regarding developments around their primary challengers. In response to Walsh jumping into the fray last month, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh gave ABC News a blunt single-word response: \u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nHowever, behind the scenes the Republican Party is working to ensure full support for the president with the cancellation of a number of nominating contests in 2020, including those in Nevada, Kansas and Arizona. And while the Republican National Committee argues the cancellations are routine cost-saving measures, Trump\u2019s challenges are up in arms, with Walsh vowing to fight them in court.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party brand sucks, and it sucks because of him,\u201d Walsh argued. \u201cYoung people can't stand the party, women can't stand the party, black people who live in the suburbs can't stand it.\u201d\n\nMark Kauzlarich/Reuters\n\nBut while the candidates railed against Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP, ultimately it's Republican voters who are standing behind the president. According to the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll, more than 80% of Republicans approve of the president.\n\nSo how do these long-shot challengers break through?\n\n\u201cHere's how I beat him in the primary,\" Walsh said. \"When I say that Donald Trump is a horrible human being, when I say that I'm tired of his drama \u2026 When I say that publicly, like I do as a candidate every day -- I firmly believe most Republican voters privately believe in the objective of this campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let's not forget what happened today,\u201d Walsh added. \u201cThe president's going to be impeached.\u201d", "description": "Former Gov.
