But leaving a lasting impression on someone we've just met isn't always easy.\n\n\n\nIt also isn't impossible.\n\nAs it turns out, with the right words and actions almost anyone can create a captivating presence.\n\nTo help you figure out how to do this, we looked at the answers posted on Quora in response to the question, \"How do I become more memorable when meeting someone for the first time?\"\n\nHere were some of our favourite tips for making yourself memorable when you first meet someone new.\n\nNatalie Walters and Catherine Rice contributed to previous versions of this article.\n\nPut on your talking hat.\n\nIt's easy to stand there and let other people carry on the conversation, but you will never stick out in people's minds if you just listen, writes Julian Reisinger, dating expert and founder of Lovelifesolved.com.\n\nDon't let the fear of looking like a fool keep you from speaking up and asking questions, telling your own stories, and sharing your own opinions. Go for it, and make a lasting impression.\n\nBe blunt, slightly controversial, and completely honest.\n\nMost people avoid saying anything controversial - especially when meeting someone for the first time - because they want to play it safe to ensure everyone likes them.\n\nBut if you really want to be memorable, you may want to make a statement ... without insulting anyone or saying something offensive, of course.\n\n\"People remember extremes, not mediocrity,\" writes Reisinger.\n\nHe recommends speaking up and stating your opinion firmly and clearly, even if it makes some people slightly uncomfortable or mad. This will make you more interesting - and thus more memorable.\n\nBe a little bit unusual.\n\nBreaking out of the cultural norm is an easy way to stick out, Reisinger writes, but try to stick out in a positive way.\n\nFor example, he suggests coming up with humorous and unusual answers to the typical introductory questions such as, \"How are you?\" or \"What do you do?\"\n\nWhile coming up with scripted answers may seem like a pain, he points out that you will have to answer these questions thousands of times throughout your life anyway, so it's well worth the effort.\n\nUse confident body language.\n\nRob Riker says confident body language does more than make you look good - it makes you more memorable.\n\nTo do this, the founder of The Social Winner blog suggests having a firm handshake, standing up straight, and maintaining eye contact both while listening and speaking.\n\nIf you aren't talking with anyone for a few minutes, then he says you should look out in front of you, rather than at the ground. \"You are engaging with the world, not hiding from it,\" he writes.\n\nHe also says you should \"own the space around you.\" This means not sitting on the edge of a bench so other people have more room than you or acting embarrassed if your arm touches someone else's arm. \"Take what's yours without being a jerk,\" he concludes.\n\nTrigger emotions.\n\nThis piece of advice from Reisinger stems from author and poet Maya Angelou's famous quote: \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\"\n\nIn order to leave a deep impression on someone, you need to make them feel something ... preferably something good.\n\nHow do you do that in a casual conversation? Reisinger suggests showing vulnerability, making them laugh, making a mistake and apologising for it, stroking someone's ego, telling stories, being helpful, or discussing a topic in a heated manner could all do the trick.\n\nBe an engaged listener.\n\nWe mentioned earlier than you should talk, and not just sit back and listen the whole time. But when you are listening, be attentive and engaged.\n\n\"The most popular and memorable people in the world are those who give us their undivided and full attention,\" says journalist Becky Blanton.\n\nThis is harder than it seems. Most people are constantly thinking of what to say next and looking for a break in the conversation for when they can jump in and say it.\n\nLike Reisinger, Blanton says we remember how people make us feel and when you truly listen to someone, you will make them feel important - and they'll remember that.\n\nSmile.\n\n\"When first meeting someone, you want to be smiling,\" writes Riker. \"This shows that you are happy, in a good mood, enjoying life and happy to meet them. Smiling also triggers the other person's mirror neurons which produce the feeling that their own smile would provide - a happy feeling!\n\nUse their name.\n\n\"A really effective way to be 'memorable' to the other person is to use their name in conversation,\" writes Kara Ronin, a social skills expert and Udemy instructor.\n\nIt tells them you were paying attention and that you care.\n\n\"Our name is intrinsically linked to us,\" she explains. \"Whenever we hear somebody use our name we immediately think, 'Oh, he/she must really like me because they remember what my name is.' Of course, you don't want to use their name with a tone of voice that suggests you're reprimanding them.\"", "description": "Here's how to make a lasting impression.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7883/174115328d444a11847e60863e216cd5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
