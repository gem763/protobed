One investor told us Medicare for All is a \"utopian pipe dream.\"\n\nStill, the S&P 500 health care index shed $150 billion of market value during a 4-day stretch in April \u2014 right after Sen. Bernie Sanders talked up his Medicare for All plan and UnitedHealth CEO Dave Wichmann called out the proposal.\n\nYes, but: Medicare for All is only one factor investors have been getting nervous about, said Jason Norris, who researches health care stocks for Ferguson Wellman Capital Management, a $5 billion investment firm.\n\nThe Trump administration's drug rebate rule appears likely to go into effect in 2020, and that would drastically change how health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiate for drugs.\n\nSales of many blockbuster drugs are maturing, leaving investors wondering what's next, Bloomberg reported.\n\nUttering \"Amazon\" and \"health care\" in the same sentence always spurs a freakout, and the e-commerce giant is more actively marketing PillPack, its recently acquired mail-order drug company.\n\nDon't forget: Computers, not humans, do a lot of the stock trading \u2014 so a big part of the selloff also is tied to machines copying each other.\n\n\"The algorithms take over,\" said Emily Evans, a health care managing director at investment research firm Hedgeye. \"It trips the wire and causes everything else to sell.\"\n\nThe bottom line: \"Investors have owned a lot of health care,\" said Norris, whose firm has been pruning health care stocks since Democrats took over the House in 2018. \"We were really overweight. A lot of this uncertainty is (leading to) reducing that exposure.\"", "description": "And yet, the industry is recording record profits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/hTstT15ZOccxyu0scYrG4ciBHhY=/0x0:3000x1688/1920x1080/2019/04/30/1556649081258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-02"}
