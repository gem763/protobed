We\u2019re republishing it today for the 25th anniversary of Friends. Photo: NBC\n\nAs Friends wrapped up its fourth season in May of 1998, Ross and Rachel\u2019s on/off relationship still provided the show\u2019s emotional core, with the other four roommates serving as the platonic Greek chorus to the couple\u2019s climactic kisses and \u201con-a-break\u201d-dom. But then, in the second half of the season\u2019s hour-long finale \u2014 the one with Ross\u2019s ill-fated London wedding weekend with Emily \u2014 another duo surprisingly hooked up, much to the glee of audience members: Monica and Chandler. Their relationship would evolve as the complete opposite of Ross and Rachel\u2019s: long-kept secret from the other roommates, and healthy and strong until the series ended with them married, parents of adopted twins. Although pairing off sitcom characters is always a risky venture, especially when a show already has one successful couple, Monica and Chandler quickly became a fan-favorite romance, with viewers loving the chemistry between Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry. Back in 2013, when this story was first published, former Friends exec producer Scott Silveri, who co-wrote the episode with future wife Shana Goldberg-Meehan (and, as with most sitcoms, lots of input from the rest of the show\u2019s writing staff) explained the genesis of the relationship, the reservations that nearly stopped it from happening, and why he thinks it added years to the show\u2019s life.\n\nFriends was nearly 100 episodes into its run before the show\u2019s writers played the Monica-and-Chandler card, but the coupling was something that almost happened earlier. The idea had been \u201ckicking around\u201d since before Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan joined the show in season three, he remembers, with his predecessors taking note of the chemistry between the two characters as early as the season-two episode \u201cThe One Where Ross Finds Out.\u201d That plot had Monica acting as a trainer for Chandler as he tried to shed a few excess pounds, and \u201cthere was a real fun dynamic between the two of them,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cSo even as early as that, they said, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re kind of special together. If we\u2019re ever looking for another relationship, that\u2019s something to file away.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe notion of Monica and Chandler was also seriously pitched in the writers\u2019 room in season three, Silveri says. \u201cPeople got excited about the idea,\u201d he says, including himself among that group. Goldberg-Meehan, however, thought it was simply too soon in the show\u2019s life to introduce another couple. \u201cShe was the one who said, \u2018I just feel like at this point it would feel a little desperate,\u2019\u201d Silveri recalls. \u201cWe had gotten excited about the stories we could tell, but once she said that, we were all shamed and ran away. It became clear it was too early to explore something like that.\u201d Another reason the writers put a pin in the idea: \u201cThere was a little bit of relationship ennui among us writers,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cWe\u2019d already done a lot of drama between Ross and Rachel. And nobody wanted it to become the \u2018Get Together and Break-up\u2019 show.\u201d\n\nBut after season three, with Ross and Rachel well into their legendary \u201cbreak,\u201d the timing objections started to melt away. \u201cWe weren\u2019t so immersed in relationships,\u201d Silveri says. Plus, the logic of another coupling was starting to grow stronger, at least in the eyes of some of the writers. \u201cThe thinking was, if the show\u2019s going to be entertaining for years to come, it can\u2019t simply rest on this one [Ross and Rachel] relationship,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cSo it follows that if another pair got together, that would be fun and provide more story. And it\u2019s organic: If you get six friends together, all around the same age, there\u2019s gonna be a little mixing and matching as time goes on. It felt real.\u201d As they got together in summer of 1997 to map out story lines for the upcoming season four, the writers decided that bringing Monica and Chandler together would be, according to Silveri, \u201ca great goal for the end of the season.\u201d They just needed to figure out how.\n\nThe writers knew they couldn\u2019t \u201cdo the exact same thing\u201d as Ross and Rachel, Silveri explains. Their different approach mirrored how people often approach new romantic relationships, \u201cwhich are often reactions to the last relationship you had,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone\u2019s too high drama, you look for someone stable. And so with Monica and Chandler, we decided to roll out in a way that was a reaction to the last big relationship [the show] had.\u201d Specifically, they wanted to keep things low-key. \u201cWith Ross and Rachel, it was so public, it was experienced by the group,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cLike, before there even was a \u2018Ross and Rachel,\u2019 there were the guys coaching Ross [about how to get her]. And then in the third season, with the breakup, it affected the six of them as much of the two of them. We\u2019d ridden that bus as far as we cared to.\u201d So the mandate was to introduce Monica/Chandler in a way that \u201cwould be not too heavy, not too soap opera, but also something surprising.\u201d\n\nWhat the writers came up with was definitely a shocker. Yes, some Friends fans probably saw hints of a relationship coming for a while; the first episode of season four had the twosome cutely bonding over a jellyfish sting. But it\u2019s hard to imagine even the most ardent \u2018shippers expecting the big reveal to happen during the wedding, when there was so much focus on about Rachel\u2019s emotions about Ross marrying someone else. The hookup happened suddenly in the last half of the show, with zero preamble; after Ross excitedly bursts into Chandler\u2019s hotel room then leaves, Monica pops out from under the covers and asks, \u201cDo you think he knew I was here?\u201d to much audience shrieking. (A season-seven episode, \u201cThe One With the Truth About London,\u201d revealed more details.)\n\n\u201cThe goal from the get-go was to treat Monica and Chandler\u2019s hookup as a surprise, a jolt in the second half of the hour-long episode to add some energy and fun,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cThe only real debate was around just how we\u2019d get Monica and Chandler there that morning, how many crumbs to drop to lead the audience and the characters to the moment, all in hopes that the fact that they ended up in bed that morning wouldn\u2019t feel unmotivated and false.\u201d In earlier scenes at the rehearsal dinner, Chandler had tried to talk a drunk Monica out of her funk over having no boyfriend, and a drunk party guest mistaking her for Ross\u2019 mother. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want you?\u201d he asked. Says Silveri, \u201c[We were] basically shooting for the spot between, \u2018This stinks, that never would have happened!\u2019 and, \u2018This stinks, I saw that coming!\u2019 More of a delighted, \u2018That is surprising, but also very satisfying and organic. It might not stink!\u2019\u201d\n\nSilveri and the other producers got a sense of how viewers would react to their storytelling decisions months before the episode aired on NBC. With the episode shooting in London (where the show was also a hit) instead of Burbank, producers wanted to give as many locals the chance to see a taping as possible. So rather than following the standard practice of filming multiple takes of scenes, producers instead shot the episode all the way through, like a play, for three different studio audiences. \u201cSo we got to experience them seeing that [Monica and Chandler] scene three times,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cThe first time, I was huddled around a monitor, watching [the actors] perform. And when Monica popped up from beneath the sheets, there was just this explosion from the audience. It was a combination of a laugh/gasp/cry/shriek. They were just blown away by it. It was so intense, for the second or third takes, instead of watching the monitors, I just turned around and watched the audience.\u201d Today, of course, producers would\u2019ve filmed that scene on a closed set, fearful that audience members would tweet about the moment the second they left the studio. \u201cBefore the dawn of social media, you could keep secrets,\u201d Silveri laughs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nBut while in retrospect it all seemed like the perfect beginning to what would become a great TV relationship, Silveri insists that while he and Goldberg-Meehan wrote the London episode, they weren\u2019t sure the whole thing would last. Even later that year, when the writers returned from hiatus and began breaking stories for season five, \u201cThe question was, \u2018All right, is this something we dispense with after a week? [or] Is it something we explore a little more?\u2019,\u201d he says. In fact, Silveri admits the London hookup was something of a trial balloon, designed to see how viewers reacted to the idea, and if Perry and Cox had the sort of sexual chemistry that producers thought they might. Co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane were always \u201ceager to try things\u201d on Friends, says Silveri, but they also always tried to make sure they didn\u2019t get stuck in boxes they couldn\u2019t get out of if need be. \u201cThey did that with all of the relationship arcs,\u201d Silveri explains. \u201cWith Courteney and Tom Selleck [in season two], if I\u2019m not mistaken, there was no sense [at first] that was going to become a relationship with a capital \u2018R,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThey went into that, and it was going to be one episode, two tops. And then they had such good chemistry, the producers and the writers at the time decided to explore it a little more.\u201d So with Monica and Chandler, \u201cThere were plans, but there was no [final] decision,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always, \u2018We\u2019re gonna see how it feels \u2026 We\u2019re gonna see how it plays to the audience,\u2019 and then go forward from there. It was sound producing on their part.\u201d\n\nThe take-it-slow approach also helped smooth out another potential pitfall of Monica-Chandler: the actors. The writers knew Perry and Cox, along with the other four series regulars, were protective of their alter egos, particularly when it came to romantic entanglements within the group. \u201cI\u2019m remembering there were a lot of conversations about, \u2018Is this the right thing to do?\u2019,\u201d Silveri says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody balked too much at them hooking up. That felt natural. The fallout came in the following year, when it became a relationship. They were acutely sensitive to how it played out.\u201d That hesitation, plus the writers\u2019 own doubts, helped shaped the first half of season five. \u201cWe plotted it out in a self-protective way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a relationship [the other characters were] talking about. Nobody knew about it. We as writers were almost as protective of it as those characters were. We didn\u2019t want to make too much of a deal about it too early. That\u2019s what you saw on the screen, but it\u2019s also how we experienced it. We didn\u2019t want to spend too much too fast. We didn\u2019t want it to be high drama. So we just kept taking baby steps forward and feeling our way through.\u201d And it seemed to work: Audiences embraced the two as a couple, and Perry and Cox ultimately accepted the idea as well. \u201cBecause of the way we eased into it, we sort of greased the machine,\u201d Silveri says.\n\nIn the end, the pairing of Monica and Chandler ended up rivaling that of the show\u2019s core romance, Ross and Rachel. It altered the show\u2019s dynamic, but didn\u2019t ruin it. This was no small feat: Most shows have trouble managing one big couple (see: New Girl), let alone two. And even Friends didn\u2019t make every coupling click: Joey and Rachel flirted with a relationship toward the end of the show\u2019s run, but the two didn\u2019t go all the way. (\u201cThey ultimately did feel more like a brother/sister relationship,\u201d Silveri says.) Monica and Chandler, however, just worked \u2014 and Silveri believes that success was a critical component to the show\u2019s ultimate longevity. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a Monica-and-Chandler relationship, if the center of Friends had remained Ross and Rachel, you would\u2019ve seen a much shorter shelf life for the show,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout Monica and Chandler, it ends three years earlier. I don\u2019t owe my whole house to them, but at least two bedrooms and a bath are because of them.\u201d", "description": "The co-writer of the sitcom\u2019s famous London hookup episode walks us through how Monica and Chandler came to be.
