Dozens of roads were blocked and slogans critical of the ruling dispensation -- the JDU-BJP alliance -- were raised vociferously by the people whose lives continues to hang in balance even now.\n\nUnion minister Giriraj Singh attacked the Nitish Kumar government for its \u201cinept\u201d handling of the Bihar floods and this has led to skirmishes between the alliance partners.

One does not become a leader just by chanting the name of Mahadev (Lord Shiva) every now and then,\" JD(U) spokesman Sanjay Singh was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.\n\nThe blame game is increasing further as even bureaucrats and officials tasked for the proper functioning of the drains remain clueless about whose failure led to such a devastating scenario.
