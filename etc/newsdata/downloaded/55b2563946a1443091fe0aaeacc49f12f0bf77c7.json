The other cautious companies are reportedly some of Facebook\u2019s biggest-name Libra partners: PayPal and Stripe, as well as Visa and Mastercard.\n\nReuters reports that Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook stated that a Libra-like crypto-project was not in the company\u2019s plans, and even went on to pour scorn on the Libra project.\n\nCook stated,\n\n\u201cI really think that a currency should stay in the hands of countries. I\u2019m not comfortable with the idea of a private group setting up a competing currency.\u201d\n\nHe also added, in a comment bound to bring cheer to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, \u201cA private company shouldn\u2019t be looking to gain power this way.\u201d\n\nThe comments come almost a month after the company\u2019s vice president said Apple was \u201clooking into\u201d possible cryptocurrency operations.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been multiple reports that Libra partners will look to end their association with Facebook\u2019s forthcoming token.\n\nPer a report from the Financial Times, PayPal executives failed to show up to a scheduled Libra Association meeting on Thursday. The newspaper stated that PayPal was \u201con the verge of quitting\u201d Libra over its regulatory concerns.\n\nThe Australian Financial Review also quoted \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d as its source in a report claiming that Stripe and PayPay, as well as Visa, Mastercard, were all looking to back out of Libra, as the companies are \u201cconcerned about maintaining positive relations with regulators\u201d who have shown disdain for Libra.\n\nThe reports follow revelations from earlier this week about the card operators\u2019 reservations. The Wall Street Journal had stated that \u201cVisa, Mastercard and other financial partners\u201d were \u201creconsidering their involvement following a backlash from United States and European government officials.\u201d The news outlet also quoted \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d as its source.\n\nAt the time, Facebook\u2019s blockchain chief David Marcus tweeted that Libra needed \u201ccommitted members\u201d if it were to succeed.", "description": "Apple has joined a fast-growing group of companies that are suddenly getting cold feet about all things cryptocurrency-related.
