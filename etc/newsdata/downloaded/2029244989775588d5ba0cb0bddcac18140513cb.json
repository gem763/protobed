(AP) - Tennessee\u2019s plan to become the first state to receive Medicaid funding in a lump sum drew overwhelming opposition and no praise at its first public hearing Tuesday.\n\nAround 30 people worried aloud at the Nashville hearing that the $7.9 billion block grant proposal could compromise coverage and care for Tennessee\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. Some contended the plan would be illegal. Many called for Tennessee to expand Medicaid instead.\n\nThe hearing offered a tough initial in-person public review of the plan for officials with TennCare, Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program. Republican Gov. Bill Lee revealed the overhaul proposal last month, touting it as a chance to be innovative and demonstrate efficiencies in delivering the same services. Tennessee has a November deadline to submit its final proposal to the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe have represented (here) trade associations, disability groups, specialty care, primary care, physicians, charitable clinics, pediatrics, caregivers, senior citizens, community mental health experts, addictions experts, mental illness experts, attorneys, mothers, a father\u2026 and others,\u201d said Tom Starling, CEO of Mental Health America of the MidSouth. \u201cI mean, this is essentially the safety net group of Middle Tennessee, if not of the state of Tennessee. And we\u2019re saying that this just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the governor told reporters that he is not concerned about the plan\u2019s legality, adding that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is supportive of states putting forth proposals. He contended current beneficiaries won\u2019t risk losing benefits or being taken off eligibility rolls. He also said the plan is an opportunity for \u201cproviding more services to the TennCare population and potentially providing more access to people to those services.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big win for Tennessee if we get it done. We feel really, really good about the prospects,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not perfect. So we want to make it more perfect by getting public comment.\u201d\n\nShannon Baker of the American Lung Association\u2019s state chapter was among the many speakers who were not convinced that Lee could deliver on those promises.\n\n\u201cAs the gap between the block grant and actual cost of patient care increases over time, Tennessee would be forced to limit new enrollment, reduce benefits, lower provider payments, or increase cost sharing for patients,\u201d Baker said.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper spoke first at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, arguing the plan would further damage health and help close more hospitals, a trend that has been hitting rural Tennessee. He said Tennessee should instead expand Medicaid under former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cThis waiver request not only doesn\u2019t help, it actually goes backwards,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThis is a radical Trump inspired plan to treat Tennesseans like guinea pigs.\u201d\n\nMore public hearings are set to following Wednesday in Knoxville and Thursday in Jackson. Officials say hearings are being planned for Memphis and Chattanooga as well. Tennesseans also can submit comments on the proposal online until Oct. 18. Another federal public comment period would follow.\n\nThe block grant would only cover core medical services for the disabled and blind, children, adults and elderly - or about 1.2 million Tennesseans. This means administrative costs, prescription drugs, uncompensated hospital care payments and individuals dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare would not be part of the block grant plan, which is a much lower population of TennCare.\n\nThe federal government would increase Tennessee\u2019s block grant funding if enrollment grows beyond what was originally calculated.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tennessee's plan to become the first state to receive Medicaid funding in a lump sum drew overwhelming opposition and no praise at its first public hearing Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Mattise"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/health_overhaul_tennessee_71145_c0-1417-3486-3449_s1770x1032.jpg?b8a0957dab3cfcbd538123afe8b30aa3e956a760", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
