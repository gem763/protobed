We\u2019ve been following its demise closely, since identifying its test of a long-term bearish trendline back in March, it\u2019s double-top in April and potential 300-pip slide in June.\n\nNZDCAD Daily Chart\n\nAfter breaking below the 0.8500 target, the cross remains in an established bearish channel and shows the potential for a bear-flag on lower timeframes. Whilst the channel allows potential for a deeper correction against the dominant trend, we\u2019d consider short setups if prices remain below 0.8500.\n\nThe daily trend structure remains firmly bearish, the CA-NZ 2yr yield differential has broken to new lows (ahead of price action) and, of course, Canadian dollar have the yield advantage with BOC\u2019s base rate at 1.75% versus RBNZ\u2019s 1%. Put together we suspect upside could be limited for NZD/CAD. Furthermore, we can see that Canada\u2019s data is outperforming New Zealand\u2019s, using the spread between NZ and CA CESI (City Economic Surprise Index).\n\nFor now, we\u2019re watching to see how prices react around 0.8500, and the potential for a bear-flag breakdown.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: NZD/CAD.
