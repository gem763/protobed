On their quest to uproot food, they are capable of demolishing farm crops, forests, open fields, properties and even historic sites like monuments. In the U.S., they do an estimated $1.5 billion in crop damage every year.\n\nJeanine Neskey is an extension specialist with the USDA Wildlife Services in Colorado. She explains that the animals can impact livestock through predation, agitation, and spreading disease, calling them \u201cone of the world\u2019s most destructive invasive species.\u201d\n\nIn Saskatchewan, the person tasked with targeting the animals says they only get a handful of calls about the pests every year from farmers and municipalities.\n\nDarby Warner is executive director of insurance with Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation, which has run the wild boar program in the province since 2015. They are tasked with investigating sightings of the animals and if found, euthanizing them.\n\nIn 2017, they collaborated with the US Department of Agriculture to put GPS collars on so-called \u201cjudas\u201d pigs, in order to track their activities, and find other pigs.\n\n\u201cWe act on all sightings of wild boars and take appropriate actions to control those animals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re using all the science we can on the removal side, using all the tools available to us.\u201d\n\nHowever, some experts feel that not enough is being done to prevent the spread of feral pigs, especially in the prairie provinces.\n\nRyan Brook, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan\u2019s College of Agriculture and Bioresources, calls the situation an \u201cemerging crisis\u201d. He tells Yahoo Canada that the potential spread of the pigs shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. Wild pigs now occupy about 900,000 square kilometres of the country, and their populations are expanding at about 80,000 square kilometres per year. The animals are highly reproductive - with females producing large litters up to two times a year - and have low mortality rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a very rapid expansion...although the large majority of that is in the three prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba,\u201d he says.\n\nHe adds that while the wild pigs aren\u2019t being spotted, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there. The animal can be elusive, turning nocturnal if they sense danger.\n\nIn the U.S., wild pigs are known to roam the southern states, while the northern states are mostly free of the animals. But Brook says the concerns coming from Montana are real and justified, given the limited efforts in Canada to control the population.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve detected wild pigs very close to the U.S. border in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, certainly less than 20 km from the border,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir capacity to move across international border is very, very real.\u201d\n\nBrook says to his knowledge, Alberta is the only province with a strategy and management plan to address the issue. He believes the only way to properly target the problem is to have a national and international strategy in place.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pretend to talk about eradication or any kind of reasonable control of these unless there\u2019s a strategy in place and collected efforts to achieve that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike a forest fire. If it\u2019s detected early and addressed aggressively, a small fire can be put out. But if a fire gets so large, it becomes out of control. That\u2019s how wild pig populations work.\u201d", "description": "There's a growing problem at the U.S.-Canada border, and it's feral pigs.", "authors": ["Elianna Lev"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BVU81s_4sdnhK5jQNrPARQ--~B/aD0xMzQzO3c9MjA0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/e412f650-d64b-11e9-afbf-72b631565f5c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
