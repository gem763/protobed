They had people dying. To just abandon them like that so the Turks can come in and slaughter them is not just immoral, it taints our reputation all over the world,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible mistake. We\u2019ll have to think of what options there are. I\u2019m sure the Senate will, potentially, take some vote to disagree with that decision.\u201d\n\nTrump has defended his actions as a much-needed withdrawal from the Middle East. But he was conducting some measure of damage control on Wednesday, releasing a statement about Turkey\u2019s Syrian invasion: \u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment,\u201d Trump said.\n\nDespite the cascade of criticism from Democrats and Republicans like, Trump has gained plaudits from libertarian-leaning allies like Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie, both Republicans from Kentucky. On Wednesday afternoon Paul said that Trump is \u201cthe first President in my lifetime to understand what is our national interest and what is not. He is stopping the endless wars and we will be stronger as a result. The Cheney/Graham Neocon War Caucus has cost us too much fighting endless wars.\n\nTrump called U.S. intervention in the Middle East the \u201cworst decision ever made in the history of our country\u201d and retweeted Sergio Gor, a Rand Paul aide, who asked why Democrats weren\u2019t supporting Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nHistorically, Democrats have been far more in line with dovish foreign policy and scaling back the U.S. presence in the Middle East. But liberals and more centrist Democrats alike have lashed out at Trump this week, with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) declaring that Trump has \u201cleft our allies at risk of being slaughtered and spurred massive additional instability.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) laid out why Trump is facing bipartisan criticism rather than more predictable opposition from GOP hawks.\n\n\u201cThere are many Democrats that are for a responsible withdrawal from Syria,\u201d Khanna said, arguing Trump moved without forging any sort of assurances for the Kurdish people. \u201cWhat we should have done is get Erdogan to commit not to invade the Kurds. And we have extraordinary leverage. They are a NATO ally, we can say: \u2018You won\u2019t be part of NATO if you do this.\u2019 We sell them weapons, we provide them economic aid.\u201d\n\nKhanna said \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d if Turkey continues military actions in Northeastern Syria. Graham is working on a sanctions bill with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have been critical of the president\u2019s withdrawal from Syria. Congress could in theory insert language responding to the situation in Syria in either an upcoming spending bill or a defense policy bill, both of which are must-pass bills.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in Albany, N.Y., on Tuesday night that he expects \u201cCongress will take some form of action.\u201d A nonbinding amendment expressing support for a presence in Syria easily passed the Senate earlier this year with 70 votes, signaling there could be enough support to override a presidential veto.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/35/a6ae2e2a4b58b556eea7fcee07ba/190520-lindsey-graham-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
