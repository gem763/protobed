As the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa, the Unesco-designated town (located on an island of the same name) was one of the most important trading centres in Africa during the 14th Century.\n\nLamu lies in the Indian Ocean about 240km north-east of the port city of Mombasa, which it rivalled as an entrep\u00f4t for gold, spices and slaves until most trade partners abolished slavery in the late 19th Century. As trade activity declined, Lamu Old Town held fast to its multicultural identity. Drawing influences from the Chinese, Portuguese, German, Indian and Arabian visitors who landed on its shores, Lamu created a unique amalgamation of food, language, art and architecture all its own over the centuries.\n\nNow, though, Lamu island faces a wave of change that threatens to alter the isle and its unique culture forever. A massive seven-part, \u00a320bn development infrastructure project called Lamu Port, South Sudan, Ethiopia Transport Corridor looms on the horizon. When completed, this ambitious undertaking will link Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan through railways, highways, pipelines and a 32-berth deep-sea port in Lamu. In addition, the transport corridor will be built alongside a Chinese-funded coal plant that could increase greenhouse gases in the area by up to 700%.\n\nOnly time will tell if Lamu\u2019s historic, multicultural charm survive this new outside influence.\n\n(Video by Thomas Lewton and Alice McCool, text by Emily Cavanagh)\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
