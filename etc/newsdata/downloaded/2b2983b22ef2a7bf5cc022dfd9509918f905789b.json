Johnson is ahead in the polls\u2014but so was the party\u2019s previous leader, Theresa May, as she headed into the last election two years ago, and she still managed to lose her majority. Under Johnson, the party has moved away from the center ground and become less small-c conservative. It is now closer to the rabble-rousing instincts of right-wing populism than to the patrician geniality of many of its former leaders.\n\nRead: This is just the beginning of Brexit\n\nIts commitment to holding the United Kingdom together\u2014its official name is the Conservative and Unionist Party\u2014is also in question, as Johnson decided to solve the Brexit impasse by allowing Northern Ireland to remain more closely aligned to Europe than to the rest of the country. Its insistence on the importance of \u201causterity\u201d and slashing public spending to reduce the budget deficit is also gone. Johnson has promised to spend more on the police, for example, without announcing tax increases to match. The Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, estimated that the next budget would see the U.K. missing its deficit target by \u00a316 billion.\n\nGreat news for the main opposition, Labour? Not quite. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, outperformed expectations in the last election, but conditions look tougher this time. His personal ratings are dire, his party has been dogged by accusations of tolerating anti-Semitism, and his stance on Brexit\u2014renegotiating a deal, then putting it to a public vote\u2014is considered lily-livered by many of his own activists, who are overwhelmingly anti-Brexit. Labour\u2019s seats encompass both Remain- and Leave-voting areas, and Corbyn has tried to keep his electoral coalition together with a nuanced (some might say vague) position. The election campaign will put that under enormous strain. It looks as though Labour\u2019s answer to the awkwardness of its Brexit position will be to change the subject. Its first fundraising promotion after the election was called, sent out in Corbyn\u2019s name, did not even mention the word, focusing instead on attacks on Big Business, the elite, and the mainstream media.\n\nRead: The quotidian uncertainty of Britain\u2019s monumental shift\n\nIn 2017, May called a vote to \u201ccrush the saboteurs\u201d who she claimed were blocking Brexit. But Labour adeptly campaigned on other issues, big and small: school funding, ivory sales, fox hunting, the future of the National Health Service. It will hope to repeat that trick this time. The relentless media focus on Brexit has obscured the fact that after nearly 10 years of \u201causterity,\u201d many parts of the public realm feel frayed and tired: potholes on the roads, closed libraries and courts, rising poverty among children and pensioners. This is what Labour wants to talk about. But with Britain\u2019s exit from the EU now an imminent possibility, and a plausible Conservative deal on the table, that will be a constant struggle. Brexit has also become a culture war\u2014shorthand for a contest of values\u2014further challenging Labour\u2019s attempts to straddle the Remain/Leave divide.\n\nAlready this feels like the most consequential British election of my career: a contest over not just Brexit, but the type of country the U.K. wants to be. The vote on December 12 could, in theory, stop Brexit\u2014but it could also endorse Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for an ultra-hard form of it. As the nights draw in, the hopes of pro-Europeans are fading.
