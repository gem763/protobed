His Job Won\u2019t Be Easy.", "language": "en", "text": "Wells Fargo was long the envy of the banking industry, able to avoid scandals that hit its competitors. But its reputation crumbled after the bank disclosed that employees had opened millions of accounts its customers had not requested. Regulators said many workers had felt pressured by a compensation policy that rewarded the opening of new accounts.\n\nWells Fargo fired more than 5,000 employees over the account scandal, but it was not the only blemish on the bank\u2019s reputation. It was also accused of forcing customers to carry unnecessary car insurance and charging improper mortgage fees, and employees told The New York Times this year that they still felt pressure to squeeze extra money out of customers.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear the bank has even identified the full extent of its problems.\n\nIn August, The Times reported that Wells Fargo was continuing to charge some of its customers fees even after it had told them that their accounts were closed. That prompted Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to call for a new round of investigations. Wells Fargo said it had begun an extensive review of its account-closing practices.\n\nKenneth Leon, an analyst at the Wall Street research firm CFRA, said Mr. Scharf\u2019s first order of business was likely to be deciding which members of Wells Fargo\u2019s senior leadership team to keep and which to replace. Mr. Leon said he expected that sort of change to be announced within three months.\n\n\u201cIt would be standard fare for the new chief executive to make those changes sooner rather than later,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Scharf\u2019s initial pay package, which includes a base salary of $2.5 million and a $5 million cash incentive, could be worth as much as $27 million in cash and stock. That\u2019s in the middle of the pay range set by his peers at other large United States banks. Last year, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, took home $31 million while David Solomon, Goldman Sachs\u2019s new head, got $23 million.\n\nMr. Sloan, the previous chief executive, was paid more than $150 million over the course of his last eight years at the bank and received a retirement package worth about $24 million.", "description": "Charles Scharf, a longtime banker and the current chief executive at BNY Mellon, will take over the scandal-plagued bank.", "authors": ["Emily Flitter"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/business/27wellsfargo1/27wellsfargo1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
