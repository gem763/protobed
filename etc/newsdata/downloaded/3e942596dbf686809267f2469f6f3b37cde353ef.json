Trump has ordered that billions of dollars in taxpayer funds be paid directly to farmers as a way to offset their losses.\n\nThe bailout hadn\u2019t needed congressional approval up to this point, but now the timing of the payments is tied to congressional approval.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture is planning to spend upwards of $28 billion in payments over two years, but the Depression-era program Trump is using for the program has a $30 billion borrowing limit that they are expected to hit this year before the completion of a second round of payments.\n\nIf Congress does not act, then some of the bailout money Trump has promised farmers could not be paid on the administration\u2019s timeline. On Thursday, a Department of Agriculture spokesman said that the money would still go out, but that the timing of the program could be impacted.\n\nIn new legislation to fund the government into November, Lowey left out of the White House request that would allow them to avert the $30 billion spending cap they are expected to hit this fall in the program being used to fund the bailout. As head of the appropriations committee, she has broad power to decide what is included in any spending bill. And lawmakers from both parties are under pressure to pass a new spending bill in the next few weeks, or they will risk a government shutdown on October 1.\n\nRepublicans suggested they might not agree to fund the government if it leaves the bailout issue unresolved. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.), chair of the Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture, said Republicans would not accept any limits on the farm credit program while the trade dispute is underway.\n\n\u201cFarmers have been hurt; the U.S. government is appropriately responding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me whether or not this is a negotiating tactic by our friends on the other side, but I do think it\u2019s important for America that this be resolved.\u201d\n\nLawmakers from both parties are hopeful they can pass the stopgap spending bill and then continue negotiating a longer-term agreement.\n\nLowey\u2019s legislation is an initial proposal that is expected to change. Democrats are aiming for the \u201cnarrowest\u201d possible bill that would be able to pass Congress and avert the government shutdown, according to an aide with knowledge of the document not authorized to speak publicly, avoiding the farm bailout and other charged requests from the administration.\n\nEvan Hollander, a spokesman for Lowey, said in a statement: \u201cThe American people deserve a robust debate on the costs of the Trump trade war. The clean CR that House Democrats have circulated will keep the government open and provide time for Congress to have that debate.\u201d\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the number two Democrat in the House, said in a brief interview that the agreement to keep the government open would include \u201cclean\u201d measures agreed to by both parties.\n\n\u201cI am going to be talking to [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell. But we do not intend to put anything into it that we think is controversial,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nLowey added that the bill is still being worked on and that there \u201care many discussions going on\u201d but that Democrats \u201chope to keep this bill as clean as possible.\u201d\n\nA number of Democrats are sympathetic to complaints from farmers in key states, particularly in the Upper Midwest, but there are growing signs that agriculture groups are pinning blame squarely on the White House for the continued uncertainty.\n\nAs part of separate trade deals, Trump is trying to pressure Japan to buy more corn and China to buy more soybeans, and he has promised farmers of both crops that they will benefit from his tactics. He continued to make that argument Thursday morning on Twitter.\n\nIt is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nThe rejection of the White House\u2019s request by a top Democrat sets the stage for a potential clash with Congress over the bailout at a vulnerable moment for U.S. agriculture.\n\nLowey\u2019s move is one of the first signs that Democrats may look for ways to dig in and force the White House to either make other concessions or revise the bailout program, which some critics say disproportionately benefits wealthy farmers.\n\nHer proposal to fund the government, intended for circulation among lawmakers, is the party\u2019s initial offer in its plan to fund the government until Nov. 21. The \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d proposal aims to maintain the status quo while averting a looming government shutdown, which is why it sidesteps controversial requests from the administration, such as the farm bailout request.\n\nAs billions flow to farmers, Trump administration faces internal concerns over unprecedented bailout\n\nThe White House has relied on billions in direct payments to farmers to help them survive the trade war with China, as China has responded to U.S. tariffs with retaliatory actions that have devastated American agriculture.\n\nThe Trump administration is using the New Deal-era Commodity Credit Corporation as its basis for paying out the \u201ctrade mitigation\u201d funds without Congressional approval. Earlier this month the Trump administration sent a letter to Congress asking for changes that would in effect increase how much the it can distribute through the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\nIf Congress does not provide the additional funding in time, the administration warned in its letter to lawmakers, CCC \u201cwould have to stop making payments . . . posing a serious risk for the farmers and ranchers supported by these programs.\u201d\n\nLowey\u2019s initial proposal to fund the government does not meet that demand or other requests from the White House over farm subsidies.\n\nTrump has promised funding to farmers in two different tranches. At least two-thirds of the administration\u2019s initial $12 billion in bailout funds for farmers were paid out last year, while the administration said earlier this year it will spend an additional $16 billion in a second round of bailouts. More than $2 billion of that second bailout has gone out, the Department of Agriculture said earlier this month.\n\nClose to three in 10 farmers feel the bailout payments will \u201cnot at all\u201d make up for losses related to the tariff battle in 2019, according to an index calculated by Purdue University released this month. But about 70 percent said the bailout would either \u201ccompletely or somewhat relieve\u201d their concerns about the tariffs.\n\nIt is unclear what could happen next, although the Trump administration has already promised farmers billions in payments this year.\n\nSome advocates have raised concerns over reports showing the bailout is overwhelmingly benefiting wealthy and white farmers. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the agriculture committee, has also raised concerns about whether the administration had promised to spend more than it had the authority to spend.\n\nIn June, Stabenow said in a hearing that the CCC only had $7.7 billion left before hitting its $30 billion limit, but noted that the administration also already said it would spend an additional $16 billion in bailout assistance.\n\nStabenow asked if the administration needed Congress\u2019 help with the rest of the bailout, to which USDA Undersecretary Ted McKinney responded: \"\u201cThere is not an answer now, but we would not presume anything if you all have not authorized that ... I don\u2019t think funds have been obligated yet that are not there. So we respect the role of the Congress, absolutely.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration has asked Congress for help spending billions on farmers caught up in its China trade war, but Democrats are balking.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AIHFUXNEURCQND2ZYET7GMGOWU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
