Other EU imports, such as gouda cheese, fruit juice, jelly, meats, olive oil, seafood, wine from France, Spain, and Germany, and Scottish whisky will be hit with 25 percent tariffs.\n\nThe WTO ruling a \u201cbig win for the United States,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe WTO has been much better to us since I\u2019ve been president because they understand they can\u2019t get away with what they\u2019ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,\u201d the president added.\n\nHowever, the WTO is also set to rule next year on how heavy of tariffs the EU can impose following a separate decision not as friendly to Boeing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough situation for us for many years. But now it\u2019s a very tough situation for them because I can remedy the situation very easily,\u201d Trump said Wednesday of trade battles with the EU.\n\nFrance\u2019s Economic Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that Europe plans to retaliate against the new tariffs.\n\n\u201cThese decisions would have very negative consequences both from an economic and a political point of view,\u201d Le Maire said Thursday at the International Monetary Fund annual meetings.\n\nThe trade deficit between the U.S. and the EU hit $109 billion last year.", "description": "The WTO approved the tariffs on the grounds that the EU granted unlawful subsidies to European aerospace company Airbus over U.S. competitor Boeing.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
