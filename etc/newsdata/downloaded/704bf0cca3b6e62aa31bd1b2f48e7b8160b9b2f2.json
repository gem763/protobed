I wanted to be a world champion and here I am now.\"\n\nGardiner said it had been moving how the people had reacted after Dorian had hit.\n\n\"In Nassau, the capital, they've had a watch party for all events and I knew a lot of people were there. I'm from Abaco (island) the big island that got hit by the storm.\n\n\"Everybody got evacuated. My house was damaged but not destroyed.\"\n\nGardiner, who was silver medallist in 2017, said the last month had felt like the Olympics but now he was on cloud nine.\n\n\"Crossing the line in first place with a new personal best and a national record - the best feeling ever right now,\" he added.\n\n\"There was no pressure, I got a lot of messages from family and friends and fans back home.\"\n\n\"They told me to go do my best. They'll be proud of me.\"\n\nGardiner said Moncur was a role model.\n\n\"I speak regularly with him. However, when he won I was not running I was probably crawling!\" he laughed.\n\nColombia's PanAm Games champion Anthony Zambrano took silver in 44.15 while Fred Kerley of the United States was third in a time of 44.17.\n\nGardiner timed his run to perfection as Grenada's 2011 champion Kirani James hared away from the blocks and down the back straight.\n\nHowever, James - hugely talented but plagued by illness in recent years - tied up going into the curve.\n\nKerley went to make his move but Gardiner had him covered and passed his rival to emerge into the straight the clear leader.\n\nZambrano, 21, finished like a train and took second off Kerley with James fading to finish fifth.\n\nKerley's failure to win saw the Americans miss out on a first ever sweep of the men's 100/200/400 and 800m world titles.\n\nThey have only won the 400m once in the last five editions - LaShawn Merritt in 2013.", "description": "Steven Gardiner dedicated his 400 metres world title to the people of the Bahamas after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Dorian last month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/84095137a46941ce8f79647b9bb66a6a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
