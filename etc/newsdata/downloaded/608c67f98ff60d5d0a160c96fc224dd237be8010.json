The trial started on October 23.\n\nProsecutors allege that in recent years, ExxonMobil used two different projections of greenhouse gas costs, thus misleading investors about its expected profitability.\n\nAs a result, the group\u2019s shares would have ended up being overvalued, costing shareholders anywhere between $416 million to over $1.16 billion.\n\nDuring around three hours of testimony, Tillerson explained that under his stewardship, ExxonMobil introduced a system of projecting costs for 2030 and 2040.\n\n\u2013 Other lawsuits \u2013\n\n\u201cOnce we came to the conclusion there was a serious risk from this (carbon taxes) it was our responsibility to understand how it could affect the business. That really began with my tenure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe question was how are you accommodating it in your long term planning? So this was a fundamental tool in helping us understand the long-term implications of the climate change issue,\u201d Tillerson told the Manhattan court.\n\nTillerson admitted that ExxonMobil used two different types of forecasts but insisted neither were intended to deceive investors.\n\nHe said they were \u201cdifferent levels.\u201d One was the \u201cmacro-economic and strategic\u201d level and the other was the \u201cmicro-economic\u201d and was applied only to choose between unrealized investments.\n\nTillerson, who appeared relaxed throughout his testimony, is the star witness in the trial, which is scheduled to end no later than November 12.\n\nThere is no jury and state Judge Barry Ostrager will rule alone.\n\nThe lawsuit does not specify damages sought but seeks to force ExxonMobil to cease the alleged fraudulent statements and requires it to pay back amounts wrongly acquired.\n\nMassachusetts state is pursing similar litigation against the company. Experts expect to see further lawsuits against ExxonMobil and other energy companies over their activities related to the environment.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Former US secretary of state Rex Tillerson denied in court Wednesday that oil and gas giant ExxonMobil had downplayed the financial", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/88eb3f_us-secretary-state-rex-tillerson-enters-courtroom-testify-in-exxon-trial-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
