However, a board challenge planned by investors, including SoftBank Group Corp and Benchmark Capital, has been put on hold until these discussions produce an outcome, the sources added.\n\nOne possibility that Neumann is discussing is transitioning into a chairman role, the sources said. Details of the discussions and what Neumann would ask in exchange for giving up his CEO title could not be learned.\n\nAnother option would be for Neumann to remain as CEO, with an independent chairman brought in to join the board, according to one of the sources.\n\nWere Neumann to agree to a leadership transition, it would make it unlikely that We Company can proceed with its plans to complete an initial public offering by the end of the year. This would mean it would have replace a $6 billion debt deal it reached with banks this summer that is contingent on the start-up going public.\n\nWe Company is considering slowing its expansion so that it burns through less cash and would therefore require less funding in the absence of an IPO in the near team, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. WeWork declined to comment. Neumann did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "description": "Neumann has started talks with WeWork's board directors and investors to discuss his future role, including the possibility of giving up his CEO title.", "authors": ["Joshua Franklin", "Greg Roumeliotis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88e77b2e22af1ab84e9578-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
