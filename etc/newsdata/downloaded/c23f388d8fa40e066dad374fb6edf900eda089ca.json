Having seen the company grow from five employees to a staff of thousands, Sverchek has played a pivotal role in helping the company hire the right people for its legal team.\n\nAs Lyft's general counsel, Kristin Sverchek is responsible for overseeing all of the company's legal and compliance efforts in the United States and Canada.\n\nSverchek explains that she likes this question \"because as driven and success-minded as most of us are, we all make mistakes at times.\" That's why she says she really looks for people to be transparent about how they've handled a situation that didn't work in their favor.\n\n\"I'm actually not looking for somebody who has 100% perfection because that's not achievable,\" she emphasizes. \"I'm looking for somebody who knows how to manage a difficult situation under extreme stress.\"\n\nSimilar to Sverchek, Facebook's vice president of product design, Julie Zhuo, also likes to test how well a candidate responds to failure or making a mistake at work. That's why, she says, her favorite interview question is, \"Hey, tell me about a hard situation \u2014 something really challenging that you went through in the last year or last two years.\"\n\nAfter a person describes the situation, Zhuo then asks them, \"Well, if you can go back to the very beginning and change anything about how you went through it, what would you do differently?\"\n\nAsking this question, Zhuo explains, allows her to \"hear a candidate and how they introspect.\" So when delivering a response, she says a candidate should never be afraid to detail how they've grown and learned from an experience.\n\n\"I can easily tell if this is the kind of person who goes [and] approaches new opportunities with a growth mindset,\" she says. \"Are they excited to learn? Are they introspective, and do they take lessons from what's happened in the past?\"\n\nLike this story?
