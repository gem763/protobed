officials around the world has flowed through the UK, according to a new report.\n\nDirty money is being laundered through purchases of private jets, yachts, jewellery, university courses, private school fees and even fine wine in the UK, the group Transparency International has revealed.\n\nThey analysed more than 400 recent corruption cases to analysed how corrupt money from around the globe is pouring into Britain.\n\nMore than 600 UK business benefited wittingly or unwittingly, including 86 banks or financial funds, 81 law firms and 62 accountancy companies.\n\nHundreds of billions of pounds of criminal and corrupt money is being laundered in the UK\n\nIt comes after the case of Luca Filat (right wearing a black cap), the son of former Moldovan prime minister Vlad Filat, who, a court heard, enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle\n\nThe report states that 177 educational institutions, including some of the UK\u2019s most prestigious, have received more than \u00a34.1 million in suspicious funds.\n\nMeanwhile, a total of \u00a38.3 million was paid to 37 UK architectural and interior design firms from anonymous shell companies.\n\nTransparency UK said in a statement: 'This is corruption that hurts the poorest in global society, hampers progress and equality, and for which there should be no hiding place for its proceeds in the UK.\n\n'It\u2019s enough to sound the alarm but speak to anyone who has been working in this field long enough and they will tell you we have barely scratched the surface.\n\n'Whilst Government has shown initiative in recent years, it should concern them and regulators that there are still too many who are willing to provide a helping hand to kleptocrats and other criminals.\n\n'Our system for identifying and tackling dirty money needs a radical overhaul to deter British firms from becoming enablers of corruption.'\n\nA report by Transparency International found payments for private jets, yachts and wine\n\nIt comes after the UK's first so-called 'McMafia' case was brought against the Knightsbridge-based wife of the former chairman of the state-controlled bank in Azerbaijan.\n\nZamira Hajiyeva, 55, spent \u00a316million at Harrods between September 2006 and June 2016 while living just yards away from the world famous department store in an \u00a311.5million Knightsbridge home.\n\nDocuments revealed she spent \u00a34million at jewellers Boucheron during the lavish 10-year spree, as well as another \u00a31million on toys, \u00a31.75million at Cartier and \u00a330,000 in one payment to gourmet Belgian chocolate chain Godiva.\n\nMrs Hajiyeva has been hit with two Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs), which force her to explain her wealth or have it seized, after a High Court judge heard about her spending over 10 years.\n\nEarlier this year, another court case heard how the son of the former Moldovan prime minister splashed out \u00a3200,000 on a Bentley.\n\nLuca Filat, a 22-year-old business student at City University, was seen in pictures posted on Facebook spraying bottles of champagne on St Tropez and drinking Dom Perignon through straws at plush beach parties.\n\nCity of London magistrates' court ordered him to hand over half a million found in three different bank accounts to authorities.\n\nIt follows the cases of Zamira Hajiyeva, the Knightbridge-based wife of the former chairman of the state-controlled bank in Azerbaijan and Jho Low (right, with Leo DiCaprio), the Harrow financier who is currently been hunted by Interpol.\n\nLast week, a BBC Four documentary The PM, The Playboy and the Wolf of Wall Street looked at the case of Jho Low, the Harrow financier who is currently been hunted by Interpol.\n\nHe is accused of stealing \u00a33 billion from his country's government after befriending Riza Aziz, the stepson of the former Malaysian PM Najib Razak, during his time at Harrow, which helped him become close to Malaysia's former ruling family.\n\nSince July 2016, the US Department of Justice has filed civil lawsuits seeking to seize a total of $1.7 billion in 1MDB-linked assets.\n\nThe assets include gifts given by Low to celebrity friends, such as a Picasso painting for Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, which he has since returned to US authorities.\n\nIn that case however, Low allegedly laundered \u00a3400million ($450million) in stolen funds through bank accounts in Singapore, the Cayman Islands, the U.S. and Switzerland.", "description": "Dirty money is being laundered through purchases of private jets, yachts, jewellery, university
