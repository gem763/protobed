He won the World Cup and Euros with Spain in 2010 and 2012 but has always been a vocal supporter of Catalonia's referendum on independence.\n\nHis political standpoint has seen him be targeted by his own fans, but Pique has learned to channel the negative energy and turn it into a motivation tool.\n\nBarcelona defender Gerard Pique has revealed he thrives on being booed by supporters\n\n'Having people against me motivates me even more, I think that the better you play, the more they are bothered,' Pique told Antena 3 TV show El Hormiguero.\n\n'There was a time that when I played with the national team that they always booed me and it was my best time.\n\n'Either you have very thick skin or it affects you. When you are young they affect you more and eventually you learn to relativise them. The world of football is very much about results, if you lose they criticise you and if you win they praise you, even if you have not played well.'", "description": "His political standpoint on Catalonia's referendum on independence has seen him be targeted by his own fans, but Pique has learned to channel the negative energy and turn it into a motivation tool.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483384-0-image-a-19_1570613209944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
