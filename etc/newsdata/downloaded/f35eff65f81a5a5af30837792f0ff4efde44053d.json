You gotta soak your arm in Epsom salt because you\u2019re playing all day.\u201d\n\nHis recent \u201cHollywood Africans\u201d album hit No. 1 on the Billboard jazz charts and his \u201cAnatomy of Angels \u2014 Live at the Village Vanguard,\u201d was so popular, he\u2019s preparing a second live recording called \u201cChronology of a Dream,\u201d out November 1.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut amid the whirlwind, Batiste does make time to relax, often with video games, a medium that shaped both his childhood and career.\n\nPlaying games is not just a distraction for Batiste. Games are of prime importance in his life, motivating him since his youth. His dressing room at \u201cThe Late Show\u201d is packed with keyboards, tailored suits and matching watches, but also a Nintendo Classic Edition, an original PlayStation, an original Super Nintendo (with cartridges), a PlayStation 4 and a number of fighting games, like the most recent Dragon Ball Z.\n\nWhile entertaining, Batiste, who comes from a family of accomplished musicians and began playing in a band at age 8, looks at the games on another level. For him, the games\u2019 scores and soundtracks served as early musical inspiration.\n\nHe doesn't just listen and regurgitate. Even as a child, he was fascinated by the hows and whys, the way music enhanced the game play experience and the way music cues told a story.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore playing with artists as diverse as Prince, Roy Hargrove and Ed Sheerhan, Jon Batiste grew up in Kenner, Louisiana, in what he describes as a \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cboring\u201d suburb best known for its airport. A quiet child, he played music, indulged in martial arts, wrote books, drew anime and enjoyed video games. He and his cousin Travis \u201ceven started writing video games. So, we were nerds.\u201d He was a prodigy driven to lead bands as well, as early as age 13 at Snug Harbor on New Orleans\u2019s Frenchman Street.\n\nIn his 20s whether it was doing an impromptu concert (what he calls a \u201clove riot\u201d) for hundreds on the Lower East Side\u2019s Ludlow Street or playing his signature melodica on Colbert, Batiste said he was always over-prepared. Maybe that has something to do with what he learned from games as well, because you just can\u2019t go into Street Fighter, one of his favorites, and win without knowing moves \u2014 the blocks, the general rhythm of the match, all the ins and outs.\n\nHe uses his knowledge of games\u2019 music to this day. For instance, he\u2019s now writing the music, lyrics and part of the story for a musical by Jean-Michel Basquiat, which will premiere late next year in New York. As he creates the score, he said he\u2019s pulling from his history with games, because \u201c[games] subconsciously taught me about theme and development, how to create catchy themes that you want to hear over and over again. But at the same time, the theme can\u2019t be annoying. It can\u2019t be. After you\u2019ve heard [an annoying] theme 100 times, you\u2019re ready to put the game on mute.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith Batiste on the move again, the conversation about his game-fueled musical education continued on a walk from the Ed Sullivan Theater to the Universal Music Publishing building four blocks away. He said his favorite is Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy VII, and his love for the four-hour score was made apparent by his short shouts of appreciation as he recalled the music.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much in it,\" he said. \"Life, love, death, adventure. Ooo, when you play against Sephiroth at the end! The graphics! The remake comes out next March. They better not screw it up!\u201d\n\nHe mentioned that he\u2019s looking forward to Hideo Kojima\u2019s forthcoming PlayStation 4 game, \u201cDeath Stranding.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is, but it looks like it\u2019s going to be really good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInside a posh studio at the Universal Music Group on Broadway, Batiste continued the discussion while seated at a grand piano. He played 10 classic video game songs as he explained their significance to him and to music as a whole. The performance included themes from Donkey Kong Country, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy VII and Mega Man.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese songs are almost like Disney soundtracks,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou see people light up. Stories come flooding into people\u2019s minds when they hear these songs.\u201d\n\nAs he played a ragtime version of a Street Fighter 2 song, he discussed the game\u2019s diversity. \u201cThis was impressive,\" he said. \"That game has themes for every character and every character came from a different part of the world.\u201d He talked about the backstories of Sagat and Ryu as if they were old friends.\n\nSeated at the piano, Batiste was in the groove. He sang game melodies with an impassioned voice, occasionally scatting, and then a Harry Belafonte-style call-and-response that filled the large room in which he played.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d he shouted as he stopped playing the theme from The Legend of Zelda. \u201cThe harmonic concept feels like it\u2019s optimistic, but there\u2019s something else happening. It\u2019s a journey that\u2019s happening.\u201d He called Ocarina of Time \u201cmythic,\u201d then took it deeper.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat is like Coltrane,\u201d he said, and segued from that game\u2019s score right into the legendary musician\u2019s hypnotic version of \u201cMy Favorite Things.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, Batiste wove a cross-cultural thread from the best of jazz to the best of game music. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s merged music with gaming. This past summer Batiste mentored six young musicians in his role as co-artistic director at Harlem\u2019s National Jazz Museum. They created a video game.\n\nAD\n\nLater in the UMG building performance he took his assistant\u2019s phone and placed it inside the piano. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he reassured. \u201cI\u2019ve done this before.\u201d The phone made a banging, thrashing, percussive sound while it bounced on the piano\u2019s strings during a version of the Mega Man X title theme. \u201cThere\u2019s punk rock here!\u201d he said, then jumped to the drum riser nearby and banged hard on the bass drum and cymbals with his hands. \u201cI used to be in a punk band,\u201d he explained.\n\nAD\n\nLater he appeared to astound himself as he played the Super Mario Bros. underground theme. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy! That rhythm they had in there. That sounds like second line to me,\u201d he said, referring to the entrancing brass band parades that constantly move through the French Quarter.\n\nWhile playing the song that accompanies the first level of Super Mario Bros., he halted.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat chord. That chord!\" He laughed with sheer joy. \"[Playing this game] was the first time I heard that chord. That chord wasn\u2019t in modern music in the 90s. They didn\u2019t have 9th chords. That\u2019s like some Louis Armstrong.\u201d\n\nWithin these game-based gems, Batiste hears something different and deeper than many do. Sure, there\u2019s a tune he can riff upon and make new (like his version of \u201cGreen Hill Zone Level 1\u201d from the 16-bit version of Sonic The Hedgehog). But it\u2019s more. As connections to popular culture like jazz, he sees threads of fine art and that can bring together a community in reality, not just virtually on a screen or monitor. To expand upon Batiste\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d theme, it\u2019s a form of humanism.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Game music! Gotta do an album. Got to,\" he said after he finished his performance. \"And I want to write music for a new game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDespite everything on his plate, his passion \u2014 for creating, for music, for games \u2014 is keeping him hungry and sends him speeding off again. So, off he goes, just like Sonic chasing those rings.\n\nHarold Goldberg has written for the New York Times, Playboy, Vanity Fair and is the author of \"All Your Base Are Belong to Us (How 50 Years of video games Conquered Pop Culture).
