We have seen the complete demise of the most famous fund manager the UK has seen for years. Investors knew the scenario was bad but the indication from Woodford thus far had been that the fund would reopen.\n\n'This collapse is on a par with the implosion of New Star at the height of the financial crisis, and it will shake the funds industry to its core.\n\n'Woodford will be removed as fund manager and the holdings in the fund will be sold. This means investors may have to wait until next year to firstly find out the value of their investment and then to get their money back. Sadly many people will be looking at significant losses.'\n\nThe announcement comes after Mr Woodford has for months been under fire after it was revealed he pumped billions of Equity Income Fund customers' cash into risky investments that were hard to sell in a hurry.\n\nHe took the shock decision in June to bar investors from pulling their cash.\n\nThe move left tens of thousands of British savers in uproar, barred from accessing their nest eggs for months because his fund has run out of ready cash.\n\nBut the multi-millionaire financier contnued to charge fees totalling almost \u00a3100,000 every working day, meaning his Woodford Investment Management company is on course to rake in almost \u00a312million from trapped clients before the fund is reopened\n\nThe Woodford Equity Income Trust is not publicly listed, but this chart - of Woodford's other main vehicle, the Woodford Patient Capital Trust - shows how the listed value of the once-legendary invetsors' funds have taken a hit this year\n\nIn August is emerged bosses at investment company Hargreaves Lansdown are to give up their multi-million-pound bonuses over the Neil Woodford fiasco.\n\nThe firm, which has a 40 per cent share of the DIY investing market, was the fund manager's biggest champion before he barred savers from pulling their cash out of his flagship Equity Income Fund.\n\nThe move triggered a flood of phone calls from angry customers to Hargreaves Lansdown's Bristol headquarters.", "description": "Woodford pumped billions of Equity Income Fund customers' cash into risky investments that were hard to sell in a hurry and in June he took the shock decision to bar investors from pulling their cash.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19727250-0-image-a-26_1571123535099.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
