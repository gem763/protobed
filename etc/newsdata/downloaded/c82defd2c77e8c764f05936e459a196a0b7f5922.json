Members of the public gathered outside the District Six Museum and a huge, spontaneous cheer went up as the couple arrived to tour the institution this afternoon.\n\nAmong the crowd was artist Adrien Mallel, who presented Harry with a portrait that she had done of him. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to get it to him for quite a while,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c[Meghan] said she loved it. She said \u2018wow.\u2019 She thanked me very much. He asked if it was a gift.\u201d\n\nView photos Photo credit: Courtesy of Victoria Murphy More\n\nMallel added that she thought the couple were \u201csetting such an incredible example\u201d by using their position to help those less privileged.\n\n\u201cI said to them \u2018we love what you do. The work you do for the under privileged is so important and you set such a wonderful example. She thanked me.\u201d\n\nLudwig Brink, 10, also caught Meghan\u2019s eye and presented her with a bunch of Protea, the national flower of South Africa. \u201cThis was amazing\u2014finally getting to meet her,\u201d his mother Renee, from Cape Town, said. \u201cShe was lovely. I\u2019m so happy that they\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\n\nTaya Lievenberg, five, gave Meghan a teddy. \u201cI screamed my lungs out for my daughter, so that she would come over,\u201d Taya's mother Tam, 41, said. \u201cI am so overwhelmed that she did. She is one of my idols and a woman I really look up to.\u201d\n\nView photos Photo credit: Samir Hussein - Getty Images More\n\nHarry and Meghan were shown around the museum by its director Bonita Bennett. The site commemorates the 60,000 residents who were relocated during apartheid when the area was declared whites only. Bennett told T&C that she hopes the royal visit will make more people want to come and hear the stories of District Six.\n\n\u201cOne always wants the story to be told much more broadly,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great in terms of reminding people of an important story. I think it will probably make an impact on people visiting from the U.K. and say \u2018maybe this is a place we should visit,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the aims of the visit. I think this will help to amplify that story and make it known on a broader level.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "One woman even gave Prince Harry a portrait she had painted of him.", "authors": ["Victoria Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.1BPkSXvth06tjPm0FdGvA--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/a017a877573d409918daef1b6171014a", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
