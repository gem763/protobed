REUTERS/Gary He\n\nThe retired U.S. Marine general, speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, said the United States should generally side with those standing up for human rights, which he said included the Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\u201cWhen people stand up for those (rights), I just inherently think we ought to stand with them, even if it\u2019s just moral,\u201d said Mattis, who abruptly resigned as Pentagon chief in December over disagreements with President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThis is not an internal matter,\u201d Mattis said in remarks likely to irritate Beijing, which has denounced the sometimes violent protests and accused the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest in the former British colony.\n\nTrump has previously described the protests as riots, but has also called on China to end the discord in a \u201chumanitarian\u201d way. He said a crackdown could make his efforts to end a damaging trade war with China \u201cvery hard.\u201d\n\nMattis said China\u2019s effort to pass a law to allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China was in breach of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula under which British control of Hong Kong was ended in 1997.\n\n\u201cThey said it would be two systems, and the extradition law was a violation of that,\u201d said Mattis, who is promoting a new memoir about his role in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough the extradition bill was withdrawn last week after months of unrest, the mass protests in streets and public places across Hong Kong continue, having grown into a broader pro-democracy backlash against the Chinese government.\n\nProtesters marched outside the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong over the weekend, urging Trump to help \u201cliberate\u201d the city. Hong Kong police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.\n\n\u201cWe have to be careful: We don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re going to land the 82nd Airborne Division in Hong Kong to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut morally? Yeah, I think we have to stand with them.\u201d\n\nIn his nearly two years as defense secretary, Mattis had tried to forge a relationship with the Chinese military, worried that tense relations between the two countries could boil over into conflict.\n\nSURPRISED AT TALIBAN TALKS\n\nMattis resigned from Trump\u2019s administration a day after Trump\u2019s plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria became public. His resignation letter was widely seen as a sharp critique of Trump\u2019s approach to national security, including what Mattis saw as a failure to value American allies around the world.\n\nAlthough there had been speculation that Mattis might enter the political arena, he has since declined to share his views on Trump, saying it is inappropriate for military figures to pontificate on politics.\n\nMattis also said he was surprised by the news last weekend that Trump had invited Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban leaders for peace talks in the United States. Trump said he canceled the talks after the insurgent group claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier and 11 other people.\n\n\u201cI salute people who try to bring wars to an end,\u201d Mattis said. The Taliban, however, had repeatedly failed to break with al Qaeda, the militant group behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban was offered: If you break with al Qaeda, we have no problem with you,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cPresident (George W.) Bush offered that, President Obama offered that, President Trump has offered that, and they\u2019ve declined. So yes, I was very surprised that we were at that point.\u201d\n\nAsked on Monday whether he had confidence in Trump\u2019s leadership, he said only that he had \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in American voters and in the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf we will employ our constitutional checks and balances correctly, this big experiment will continue,\u201d Mattis said.", "description": "Former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday anti-government protests in Hong Kong were \"not an internal\" Chinese matter and that the United States should offer at least moral support to the demonstrators.", "authors": ["Jonathan Allen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428033560&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881JA", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
