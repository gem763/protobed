I met Marie when David was Secretary of State and her ordeal is harrowing.\n\n'It's absolutely the right way to go and, whilst it would be wrong to precisely speculate what will be in the Queen's Speech, I can say you should be cautiously optimistic we are moving in the right direction.'\n\nLast night Mrs McCourt, 76, told the Mail she would be 'delighted' if Helen's Law was finally introduced.\n\n'It is so important, not just for me but for other families going through similar suffering, that politicians get on with it and get this law on the statute book,' she said.\n\n'After all this time, it would be amazing for it to happen.\n\n'Helen's case was one of the first where a killer was found guilty without a body but advances in policing and forensics mean we are seeing more and more. There have been several already this year alone.\n\n'Simms has served almost 32 years and hasn't had a parole hearing for nearly four years. But if he is offered another hearing, it will be much harder to release him once Helen's Law is on the statute. That's why I want it to happen as soon as possible.' Her MP, Conor McGinn, said including the measure in the Queen's Speech would be 'welcome news'.\n\nThe Labour MP for St Helens North added: 'I know the Secretary of State is personally committed to making Helen's Law happen. I hope that, at a time when Parliament is divided on many issues, that this law would receive the support of members from right across the House.'\n\nPub landlord Simms was convicted of Miss McCourt's murder by DNA evidence but has always refused to reveal the location of her body.\n\nShe was a regular at his business in Billinge, Merseyside.\n\nThe 62-year-old has served almost double his 16-year minimum term but he is in an open prison and has been pictured enjoying days out in the community, sparking fears he is being prepared for release.\n\nMrs McCourt had hoped for 'no body, no parole' legislation \u2013which would stop killers being released unless they revealed the whereabouts of a body \u2013 but said the proposed law would make a huge difference.\n\nCurrent guidelines state the Parole Board should take into account the fact that a killer has not disclosed the site of their victim's body but Helen's Law will make it a legal requirement for the first time.", "description": "Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has committed to introducing a 'Helen's Law' to keep killers who stay silent about where they concealed their victims' bodies in prison for longer.", "authors": ["Ian Drury", "Jack Doyle", "Liz Hull For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/19417532-0-image-a-11_1570489281514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
