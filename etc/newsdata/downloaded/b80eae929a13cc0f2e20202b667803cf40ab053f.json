An anonymous artist also told Sports Illustrated that Brown made unwanted sexual advances toward her, to which Brown responded by sending menacing and threatening text messages to her, leading to the Patriots releasing him last Friday. The league has not put Brown on the commissioner's exempt list since he's currently a free agent, but teams likely will stay away from him until all of his troubles are sorted out.\n\nThe Raiders released Brown at his request prior to the start of the season. While they still are searching for a way to fill the void he left, there's no doubt Jon Gruden and Co. are happy to be done with the headache.\n\nEx-Raider Antonio Brown hints at hoping for NFL return in cryptic tweet originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "It appears Antonio Brown didn't want to hang up his cleats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nPE4rxfwBeAgj5fqM_29GQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rLR0FKMeaG7biGXzF5zcNA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/1d5a8e094d13f9d59e88105c8dc94f2b", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
