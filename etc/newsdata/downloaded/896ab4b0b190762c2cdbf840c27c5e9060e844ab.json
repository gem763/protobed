He\u2019s never going to see that document. Got to protect the country.\u201d\n\nThere may be six smoking guns in there Joe Klein\n\nThe military news site Task & Purpose, meanwhile, reported that in a book to be published on Tuesday, a former aide to James Mattis says Trump ordered his first defense secretary to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d, owned by Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, out of a $10bn Pentagon contract.\n\n\u201cRelaying the story to us,\u201d the site quoted Hold the Line author Guy Snodgrass as writing, \u201cMattis said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d\n\nTrump is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry centred on his attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals. His supporters would dearly love to know who is behind the Times column and the forthcoming book, which Axios revealed promises to contain \u201ca great deal from Donald Trump directly\u201d.\n\nIntroducing Klein on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources on Sunday, host Brian Stelter said a \u201cpublishing world source\u201d had told him the instances of misconduct by Trump described in the book are \u201cspecific and shocking\u201d.\n\nKlein, 73, is a former editor and columnist for Rolling Stone, New York and Newsweek. He said his own book had not had such stratospheric expectations, but when it was published its air of mystery helped it \u201cexplode like a bomb\u201d.\n\nThe anonymous nature of A Warning was helping ratchet up anticipation, he said, adding that \u201cyou also have the track record of the column a year ago, which I thought was a courageous act\u201d by one of the people who formed \u201cguardrails\u201d against Trump\u2019s wild behaviour.\n\n\u201cI think that the guardrails are off,\u201d Klein said, \u201cand now is the time for people of good faith to stand up, identify themselves and tell the story.\u201d\n\nReferring to testimony to House committees which continues behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, he said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got \u2026 a parade of foreign service officers going in, identifying themselves, risking their careers and now that Trump is clearly way off the rails, it\u2019s time for everybody to put their cards on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere may be six smoking guns in there,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhoever this is has successfully remained anonymous for a year now, which is something I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nKlein pointed to a Washington Post report which detailed attempts by Republicans to uncover the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump\u2019s conduct regarding Ukraine lies at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nUnlike the author of A Warning, he said, \u201cthe whistleblower under law has the right to privacy \u2026 unless the anonymous author was the whistleblower, which would be hilarious, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mindblowing,\u201d Stelter said.\n\nThe end of anon: literary sleuthing from Shakespeare to Unabomber Read more\n\nKlein also pointed out that the whistleblower\u2019s life could be in danger. That might also apply to the anonymous Trump official.\n\nTwo decades ago, Klein was rumbled by Don Foster, an expert in literary forensics. Most observers expect the Trump official to be unmasked relatively quickly too, whether by forensic analytical software, by the kind of simple human error which revealed Harry Potter author JK Rowling to be the pseudonymous mystery writer Robert Galbraith, or in a co-ordinated public reveal.\n\nThe Washington punditocracy is awash with theories over who it might be. Prominent bets include Jon Huntsman, former Utah governor and ambassador to Russia; Cohn, a New York Democrat who did not issue an outright denial about Woodward\u2019s reporting; or even Nikki Haley, formerly ambassador to the United Nations and widely seen as a future Republican leader.\n\nA Warning is not out until 19 November, but in a development which will surely displease Trump, it is already the No1 bestseller on Amazon.", "description": "Trump official who wrote earth-shaking column, I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration, to release a book", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c9b8a1f471a8162688c1b6329f29e321436d556/0_149_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eba864dd66f29d38513b82f1e64386d9", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
