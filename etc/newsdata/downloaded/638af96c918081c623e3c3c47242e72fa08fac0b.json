As an FA advisor, he says that there is no longer any benefit from heading as part of youth football.\n\nStewart says that there is no longer any benefit of heading in youth football\n\nMore specific research to track current and recently retired footballers to see how their brain develops as they age;\n\nThe introduction of a national database to collate cause of death from brain diseases for sportsmen and women so it can be treated like any other industrial injury.\n\n\u2018Modern football and modern sport must change now,\u2019 said Dr Stewart, who is a consultant neuropathologist and associate professor at the University of Glasgow and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u2018Until Monday there just wasn\u2019t good, hard evidence that there was anything sport needed to act upon. There were really powerful anecdotes and personal stories but they were that... anecdotes. All the sports organisations could say, from a legal and science point of view, that you haven\u2019t shown me any evidence yet.\u2019\n\nDr Stewart paid tribute to the MoS campaign, started in 2013 by sports editor Alison Kervin and rugby reporter Sam Peters, which called for this research, which was funded by the FA and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association.\n\n\u2018Bits of the jigsaw came together and The Mail on Sunday\u2019s campaign was a very big bit of the jigsaw,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018When there was a national campaign and a major publication was prepared to make it a focus of their attention and keep coming back to it, again and again and again, with fresh stories, I think that undoubtedly was a force for change. I don\u2019t think we would be at the point of doing the research and publishing it this year [without our campaign].\u2019\n\nThe most dramatic change at grassroots could be the phasing out of heading in youth football. It is banned in the USA for kids aged 10 and under and the FA advise against repeated heading practice in youth football.\n\nStewart also blasted rulemakers for not having yet introduced concussion substitutions\n\nWith Dr Stewart being a new member of the FA\u2019s medical advisory team it seems those guidelines could be tightened up.\n\nHe added: \u2018If you look at the number of times kids who are under 14 or under 12 head the ball in the game, it\u2019s hardly ever. It\u2019s a rare event. So if it is something that happens once every few matches, or once a match, then why bother? Why not take it out all together?\u2019\n\nHe says that common guidelines should be introduced across UEFA federations and that adult pro footballers should also be subject to training protocols, such as limiting heading training to once a week.\n\nConcussion substitutes, whereby a temporary sub comes on for 10 minutes while a player is better assessed, are being considered by the game\u2019s lawmakers, the International Football Association Board, but Dr Stewart condemned their statement this week that said \u2018any solutions would have to take account of both player welfare and the need to ensure sporting fairness.\u2019\n\nDr Stewart said: \u2018That\u2019s just ridiculous. They should focus on welfare of the player and fit the game around it.\u2019 UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has backed Dr Stewart\u2019s stance.\n\nStewart wants further work to be undertaken to understand more precisely the link between contact sport and brain diseases such as dementia\n\nIt was announced this week that Dr Stewart will head up a team at Glasgow University and Penn University to investigate chronic traumatic encephalopathy and neurodegenerative disease. And he says extensive research is required for 30 years.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m calling now for a surveillance project to be set up so we treat this as a proper industrial disease. When an individual is diagnosed or dies of dementia and has been a footballer or rugby player, it should be notified centrally to an independent body.\n\n\u2018This happens for CJD and helped to identify and react to variant CJD [commonly known as Mad Cow disease] when it emerged in the mid-90s. When you look at dementia in footballers against variant CJD, the numbers are considerably higher.\u2019", "description": "CONCUSSION CAMPAIGN - EXCLUSIVE BY ROB DRAPER: Dr Willie Stewart has called for further work to understand the link between contact sport and brain diseases.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/20/20224506-0-image-a-101_1572119928929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
