(CBC)\n\nCBC News requested information about the government's actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yurek's press secretary, Andrew Buttigieg, said in a statement the government \"has already made significant progress toward further consultation and implementation\" on 19 commitments in its environmental plan.\n\nHowever, few of those commitments have anything to do with reducing emissions. They include \"appointed a special adviser for Ontario Parks\" and \"released a discussion paper on reducing plastic litter and waste.\"\n\nThe Environmental Defence report says the government is already \"not on track\" to achieve its own emission reduction targets, in part because of decisions that have slowed the pace of electric vehicle sales and delayed a push for more renewable content in fuel.\n\n\"So far, we haven't seen any meaningful steps to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change in Ontario,\" said Sarah Buchanan, clean economy program manager for Environmental Defence.\n\n\"We're quite concerned that Ontario isn't taking its obligations seriously and is breaking its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without a price on carbon,\" Buchanan said in an interview.\n\nThe signature piece of the government's plan \u2014 an emission performance standard for large industrial polluters \u2014 will actually increase greenhouse gas emissions rather than decrease them, according to the report.\n\nIt says the system is too lenient and offers too many exemptions to big polluters, and there's no evidence to support the government's forecast that the standard will contribute 15 per cent of the province's overall target for cutting greenhouse gases.\n\nSarah Buchanan, clean economy program manager for Environmental Defence, says: 'We haven't seen any meaningful steps to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change in Ontario.' (Tina Mackenzie/CBC)\n\nThe report says the government has taken no action on two programs that together account for one-third of its emission-reduction target:\n\nExpanding conservation programs to reduce natural gas consumption.\n\nSupporting innovation, such as energy storage and low-carbon heating fuels.\n\nIt says the government has taken minimal action on programs that account for another 40 per cent of the greenhouse gas (GHG) target, such as:\n\nIncreased use of green vehicles.\n\nCleaner fuels.\n\nEstablishing an emission-reduction fund for businesses.\n\nElectric vehicle sales in Ontario during the first quarter of 2019 were down 55 per cent from the same time period the previous year, after the government scrapped all rebates for purchasing electric cars.\n\nThe Ford government's plan relies on greater adoption of low-carbon vehicles for one-sixth of the province's overall target for cutting GHGs. The report says without incentives that help cover the higher cost of electric vehicles, it's 'extremely unlikely' that there will be enough such cars to significantly reduce emissions. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe government's plan relies on greater adoption of low-carbon vehicles for one-sixth of the province's overall target for cutting GHGs. Without incentives that help cover the higher cost of electric vehicles, the report says, it's \"extremely unlikely\" enough such cars will be on Ontario's roads to significantly reduce emissions.\n\nThe government is proposing to boost the minimum ethanol content of fuel at the gas pumps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the timeline is slow, with no changes proposed until 2025, and a gradual phase-in after that.\n\nThe report gives credit for \"some action, with room for improvement\" in a category that covers \"transit, waste and other commitments.\" It notes the government's efforts to reduce the amount of organic waste that ends up in landfills \u2014 by, for example, expanding municipal green-bin programs \u2014 and on some public transportation measures, such as reopening a Global Green Bond for investors wanting to put their money toward projects like energy efficient buildings.\n\nThis category accounts for six per cent of the planned reductions in carbon emissions.\n\nBecause Ontario's emissions-reduction plan does not involve a price on carbon, the federal Liberal government imposed a carbon tax on such items as gasoline and home heating fuel in the province, and paid rebates through the tax system to Ontario taxpayers.\n\nOntario is fighting the imposition of the carbon tax through the court system, and wants the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of a lower court ruling that favoured Ottawa.", "description": "The Ontario government of Doug Ford has done almost\u00a0nothing on the bulk of the promises in the greenhouse-gas reduction\u00a0plan it introduced last November, according to a new report by an environmental watchdog group.", "authors": ["Provincial Affairs Reporter", "Mike Crawley Is Provincial Affairs Reporter In Ontario For Cbc News.
