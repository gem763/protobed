Many centered on specific goals, including stopping approvals for new mining or drilling projects and switching entirely to renewable sources of energy by 2030.\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, protests sprang up over rising sea levels. Hundreds of schoolchildren in Thailand burst into the headquarters of the environment ministry in Bangkok and then lay down to mimic their own extinction.\n\nIn Germany, police in cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich warned that central areas would be shut down as tens of thousands of people joined the rallies, including one in front of the office of Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nIn Australia, about 300,000 people took part in a series of rallies, including around 100,000 who crowded into a park in Sydney, double the size of a previous protest in March. Many of the attendees held placards with slogans such as \u201cThere is No Planet B.\u201d\n\nMore Berlin Unveils Climate Package as Hundreds of Thousands Protest\n\nSimilar protests played out around India, where schoolchildren chanted outside government buildings, and Africa, where demonstrators gathered across the continent.\n\nRelated Video At the U.N.

It was a notable shift for the country\u2019s government, and ordinary Russians also are paying closer attention to the dangers of a climate shift after a summer of devastating wildfires and floods.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell people the truth about the climate crisis,\u201d said 25-year-old violinist Arshak Makichyan, who has for months been his own solo protest at Moscow\u2019s central Pushkin square. \u201cWe hope this would put more pressure on authorities to act.\u201d\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, meanwhile, said Friday that the world\u2019s largest economies should increase taxes on fossil fuels to accelerate a shift to cleaner alternatives.\n\n\u201cWe know we need to burn less fossil fuel, but when taxes on the most polluting fuels are zero or close to zero, there is little incentive to change,\u201d said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda. \u201cEnergy taxes are not the sole solution, but we can\u2019t curb climate change without them.\u201d\n\nStudents took part in one of the many global demonstrations against governments\u2019 handling of climate change, this one in Dresden, Germany.

They chanted, \u201cWhat do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!\u201d Construction workers along the march route blew air horns in solidarity while passersby clapped and cheered.\n\nSonia Chajet Wides, a 15-year-old junior at Bard High School Early College in Manhattan, said she has helped plan walkouts at her school, including one on gun control and one on climate change in March.\n\n\u201cI hope that it gives people a sense of how urgent this issue is and also how aware we are of it as a younger generation,\u201d she said of Friday\u2019s rallies. \u201cI think people can really underestimate us and not understand how important this is to us.\u201d\n\n\u2014Bojan Pancevski in Berlin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to David Winning at david.winning@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of students led a wave of rallies around the world to pressure governments to commit to tougher measures against climate change at the United Nations next week.", "authors": ["Tyler Blint-Welsh In New York City", "David Winning In Sydney", "Georgi Kantchev In Moscow", "Tyler Blint-Welsh", "David Winning", "Georgi Kantchev", "Tyler.Blint-Welsh Wsj.Com", "David.Winning Wsj.Com", "Georgi.Kantchev Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109433/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
