When they landed, they were confronted with the enormous blaze that was ravaging the north end of the county.\n\nThe couple continued their nuptials as planned at the Chateau St. Jean Winery in Kenwood, about 30 miles south of where the fire started, but not without a few hiccups, the paper reported.\n\nGetty Fire: Blaze was ignited after a tree branch fell on a power line, officials say\n\nThe air was heavy with smoke, and the skies were as red as the flames that continued to burn. However, it wasn\u2019t the first time the couple\u2019s photographer had shot weddings during wildfires.\n\n\u201cIt was the third year in a row that I had a wedding in the wine country and had smoke,\u201d Karna Roa of KMR Photography told local station KNTV.\n\nOne particular photo went viral, depicting the couple hand in hand with masks over their mouths to protect them from the smoke as the fire raged in the background.\n\n\u201cIs this the \u2018new normal\u2019 for the California wine country in 2019?\u201d Roa wondered in an interview with the Mercury News.\n\nThe couple\u2019s wedding planner Sara Sugrue told the paper that the newlyweds didn\u2019t exchange vows with the masks on and they were only worn briefly outside for pictures.\n\nCurtis told KNTV that his wife had to be talked into taking the picture with the masks because she feared it would be \u201ctacky.\u201d\n\n\"All we wanted was to have our dream wedding,\" Katie said, \"and we did. It\u2019s crazy.\"\n\n'Diablo' winds are fanning the northern California wildfires\n\nThe Kincade Fire has burned 76,000 acres, destroyed 19 buildings and forced 200,000 to leave their homes as of Wednesday morning.\n\nWildfires are nothing new to wine country. More than 40 people died and 5,000 homes were destroyed in fires that swept across Napa and Sonoma counties in 2017. More than two dozen wineries were damaged by the blazes, although most had recovered and were operating again within a few months.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, USA TODAY.
