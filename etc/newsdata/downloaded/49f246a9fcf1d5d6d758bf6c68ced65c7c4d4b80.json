On Sunday in Nepal, Communist President Xi Jinping promised anybody who tried to\"to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.\"\n\nHis comments were made towards Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli. \"And any external forces backing such attempts dividing China will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming!\" he added.\n\nAccording to Fox News, \"Xi made the explicit comments at a meeting where the two signed more than 20 agreements Sunday, including one commissioning a feasibility study of a China-Nepal cross-border railway project.\"\n\nWhile he didn't mention Hong Kong, experts surmise he was referring to that region specifically. Thousands of Hong Kongers have been protesting for the past few months each day in hopes of gaining freedom and independence from China.\n\nIncreasing rhetoric defending their oppressive regime is on the rise from the Chinese government. On Monday Townhall reported that a Chinese official defended the concentration camps where millions of Uighur Muslims are being held.\n\nvia Townhall: A Chinese communist official is defending his nation's detention of millions of Muslim Uighur minorities in internment camps where these individuals are indoctrinated and violated, saying that China is simply providing \"vocational educational training to them.\" Yu Jiantuo is China's assistant secretary general of the China Development Research Foundation (CDRF). CDRF is run by the State Council. He spoke at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Point Grey Campus and took questions from Canadian media last week. Yu told reporters that Mulsim Uighurs \u201clack social and economic opportunities\" so the state decided \"to provide vocational educational training to them\" by holding them against their will and stripping down their human dignity.\n\nMeanwhile in the United States, useful idiots like Golden State Warrior head coach Steve Kerr and Lebron are refusing to condemn China for their actions.", "description": ".10/16/2019 9:33:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis", "Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/309/970544ba-ae88-4e6a-babe-696aca5b010e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
