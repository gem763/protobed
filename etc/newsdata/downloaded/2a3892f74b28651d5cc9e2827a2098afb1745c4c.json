It measures 1636 square kilometres (632 square miles) in area, is 210 metres (689 feet) thick and weighs a massive 315 billion tons.\n\nThe iceberg will now be tracked because it poses a potential hazard for shipping.\n\nScientists from the Australian Antarctic Program, Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego have watched developments on the ice shelf for almost 20 years, after first spotting a rift developing in the early 2000s.\n\nHelen Amanda Fricker, a glaciologist at Scripps, said researchers had predicted a calving event between 2010 and 2015 -- some 50 years on from the last one which occurred on the Amery in 1963-4.\n\nIn a statement released by the Australian Arctic Division, she said: \"I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be.\"\n\nShe and her colleagues had been keeping an eye on a nearby location known as \"Loose Tooth\" since 2002 because of its shape and its precarious attachment to the ice shelf.\n\nScientists believe that the calving process is a natural phenomenon and is not related to climate change.\n\nFricker explained: \"We don't think this event is linked to climate change, it's part of the ice shelf's normal cycle, where we see major calving events every 60--70 years.\"\n\nLast week's calving -- observed on satellite imagery -- will not have an impact on sea levels, the researchers say.\n\nThe Scripps Institution of Oceanography wrote on its Twitter page: \"They [ice shelves] do not directly affect sea level because ice shelves are already floating, much like an ice cube in a glass of water. Grounded ice is the concern for sea level rise.\"\n\nIn comments posted by Scripps, Fricker added that \"while there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf.\"", "description": "A enormous iceberg bigger than Los Angeles or Greater London has separated from the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica, the largest to do so in more than half a century.", "authors": ["Rory Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191001100659-01-d-28-iceberg-antarctica-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
