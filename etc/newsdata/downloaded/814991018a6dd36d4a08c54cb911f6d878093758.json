The BBC recently highlighted attempts to slow Bulgaria's population decline \u2014 the fastest in the world \u2014 by improving educational and economic opportunities in the country, making it more attractive for younger workers to stay rather than emigrating elsewhere in the European Union or to other countries. And while the United States is projected to keep growing for the foreseeable future, Americans are waiting longer to have children, suggesting a gradually aging population.\n\nTo get a sense of the demographic challenges confronting different parts of the world, we found the countries projected to have the most rapidly shrinking populations in the next few decades.\n\nThe United Nations regularly publishes demographic projections estimating how the world's population could change over the next several decades. Using the UN's middle-of-the-road estimates for fertility, mortality, and international migration, we found the 20 countries projected to have the largest percent decline in population between 2020 and 2050.\n\nFor the purposes of our analysis, we excluded subregions or overseas territories of other countries, like the French territory of Wallis and Futuna, which is projected by the UN to have an 18.7% population loss over the next three decades.\n\nHere are the fastest-shrinking countries in the world:", "description": "Many countries face serious demographic headwinds, with low birth and immigration rates leading to aging and shrinking populations.", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cce01754caa56246e51d6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
