Power appeared to have been shut off to the complex, the newspaper reported.\n\nWitness Kyle Nelson told KTLA that he heard and saw three large explosions in rapid succession coming from the festival.\n\nMegan Houck, 26, of Long Beach, said that she saw flames come from the floor near a patio area.\n\n\"It was just like one giant fireball that went up\" she said in a story on the Press-Telegram website. \"And then there was a second explosion maybe 10 or 20 seconds later.\"\n\nHouck said that the flames went well above the roof of the village, possibly up to 35 to 40 feet high.\n\nA few minutes before the first explosion, Houck said that the lights had shut off and on. Other witnesses reported apparent electrical problems before the first blast.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
