The suit claims that Breja was terminated after opposing company practices, including shipping the contaminated flavored pods and not listing expiration dates on Juul products.\n\nThe lawsuit does not specify the contamination issue or how it occurred. Lawyers for Breja declined to elaborate on the issue Wednesday.\n\nA Juul spokesman said in a statement that the claims are \u201cbaseless\u201d and that Breja was terminated because he failed to \u201cdemonstrate the leadership qualities\u201d required for the job.\n\nJuul, the best-selling e-cigarette brand in the U.S., has been besieged by criticism amid an explosion of underage vaping. The company faces multiple investigations by federal and state officials as well as lawsuits by families of teenagers who claim they became hooked on nicotine through the company\u2019s vapes.\n\nBreja worked in Juul\u2019s global finance department less than 10 months. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, seeks damages for lost salary, bonuses and Juul stock, which it values at more than $10 million.\n\nBuzzFeed News first reported the lawsuit.\n\nBreja describes a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cwin-at-all costs\u201d culture at Juul, primarily driven by the company\u2019s former CEO, Kevin Burns, who was replaced in a management shake-up last month.\n\nBreja says he learned in March that some batches of nicotine solution used in the company\u2019s mint pods had been contaminated. Breja claims that company management shipped roughly one million pods affected by the issue and failed to issue a recall or public announcement.\n\nJuul\u2019s spokesman rejected Breja\u2019s account saying the company \u201cdetermined the product met all applicable specifications.\u201d\n\nWhen Breja protested the decision to ship the pods, the lawsuit alleges, his supervisor at Juul reminded him that \u201cstockholders would lose significant personal wealth should he make his concerns public.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Burns \u201cberated employees\u201d to ramp up production of mint-flavored pods, a move that \u201ccompromised quality control measures.\u201d The focus on mint came after the company voluntarily pulled its mango, fruit and other candy-flavored pods out of retail stores, under pressure from health authorities.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Juul\u2019s outside consultants assured the company that mint \u201cgiven its fruity flavor, would make up for any lack of sales of other flavored pods.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don\u2019t find mango they buy mint,\u201d Burns told employees, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBreja claims he was wrongfully terminated the week after raising his concerns about the contaminated mint pods. Because he had worked at the company for less than a year he did not receive company stock that his lawyers claim would be worth \u201ceight figures at its current valuation.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier conflict with Juul management, Breja says he urged executives to add expiration or \u201cbest by\u201d dates to the flavored pods.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Burns rejected the idea, stating: \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fo\u2019s, who the f\u2013 is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d\n\nJuul\u2019s website states that its pods are intended for use \u201csoon after purchase.\u201d\n\nLast month Burns was replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite, a former executive for Altria, the Big Tobacco firm that owns a 35% stake in privately held Juul.\n\nIn the last two years, the San Francisco company has become the principal target of a nationwide backlash against e-cigarettes, with parents, politicians and health advocates blaming the firm for the recent vaping craze among young people.\n\nAccording to the latest government survey, more than 1 in 4 high school students reported using e-cigarettes in the previous month, despite federal law banning sales to those under 18.\n\nIn a separate health issue, federal officials are investigating more than 1,600 cases of lung damage linked to vaping, including nearly three dozen deaths. Many patients said they vaped THC, marijuana\u2019s intoxicating chemical, but officials have not yet implicated any single product or ingredient.\n\nJuul has made a series of voluntary concessions in an effort to weather the firestorm. It\u2019s halted advertising and suspended sales of its fruit and dessert flavored pods. The company continues to sell mint, menthol and tobacco flavors.\n\nThe Trump administration announced plans last month to remove virtually all vaping flavors from the market, leaving only tobacco.\n\nBut public health advocates are concerned the administration could back away from its plan to ban mint and menthol, the most popular flavors among youth.\n\nLast month more than 50 health groups, including the American Lung Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, sent a letter to first lady Melania Trump urging the administration to follow through on its initial proposal.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to remove the e-cigarettes that are most attractive to youth, any proposal that ignores mint and menthol flavors falls short,\u201d the groups stated.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Juul Labs executive who was fired earlier this year is alleging that the vaping company knowingly shipped 1 million tainted nicotine pods to customers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Perrone"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/juul_executive_lawsuit_17089_c0-0-4339-2531_s1200x700.jpg?da2b12a209703c7ae5efddfa943a08efabc5fc90", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
