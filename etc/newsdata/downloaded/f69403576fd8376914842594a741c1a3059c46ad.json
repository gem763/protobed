It doesn't bring my dad back, it won't bring any other dads and husbands back. We knew dad could not be the only one. We just wanted that question answered.\n\n'We just wanted to see that football cared enough to find out the scale of the problem, to do the right thing and be there for these people when they need them most. Whatever they do, it must be across all parts of the game.\n\nChris Sutton has hit out at the PFA for its handling of health issues relating to heading the ball\n\n'You can't assume it is not in grassroots and there is no evidence it is generational or that it was the old leather ball. And these players who have suffered dementia must not be a statistic - they must never be forgotten. They remain in the consciousness of the game.'\n\nThe study assessed the medical records of 7,676 men who played professional football in Scotland and were born between 1900 and 1976. Their records were matched against more than 23,000 individuals from the general population.\n\nIt found that there was a five-fold risk of Alzheimer's disease, a four-fold increase in motor neurone disease and a two-fold increase in Parkinson's disease in former professional footballers compared to population controls.\n\nFormer Blackburn, Norwich and Celtic forward Chris Sutton, whose father Mike suffers from dementia, criticised the PFA for its handling of the issue.\n\nSutton said on Twitter: 'If Gordon Taylor had anything about him he would apologise to all his union members and their families who he has failed... his own members dying in the most horrible and humiliating way... he failed my dad and hundreds more.'", "description": "Clarke will present the findings of the 'Football's Influence on Lifelong Health and Dementia Risk' (FIELD) study to the FIFA Council in Shanghai this week and push for 'concussion substitutes.", "authors": ["George Sessions And Jamie Gardner"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20041870-0-image-a-6_1571758432983.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
