It was my dream, too, to be a princess,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I do of course follow the royal family, and it\u2019s good to see how they\u2019re doing. And Princess Diana, she was very special.\u201d\n\nOther guests spoke of how much they admired Burch\u2019s aesthetic and message. Burch said in her show notes that the collection brings together English garden florals, a restrained volume and her own take on the 1980s.\n\nWriter-director and transgender rights activist Janet Mock said that to her, Burch is about \u201cempowerment and ambition.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, I just love clothes and I think that her clothes are actually wearable and they\u2019re accessible,\u201d she said.\n\nActress Alexandra Daddario said she was excited that Burch\u2019s show was her first experience at fashion week.\n\n\u201cI love Tory Burch. I\u2019ve been wearing Tory Burch for years,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m from New York. I feel like it\u2019s great New York street fashion. It\u2019s a really cool way to kick things off.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From a linen and leather pant to a macrame tweed skirt, Tory Burch looked to one of the most important fashion icons of the 20th century for inspiration at New York Fashion Week: Princess Diana.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Dobson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
