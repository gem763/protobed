And only 10 candidates qualified for this debate, based on the Democratic National Committee's decision to toughen the criteria to get on stage.\n\nThursday marked the first time all of the top candidates \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2014 faced off at the same time.\n\nWhile all of the candidates made it clear they're on the same page when it comes to opposing President Donald Trump, things got heated as they sparred over the issues.\n\nBut at the end of several hours of the feisty exchanges, Thursday's debate had a handful of clear winners and losers.\n\nThe winners\n\nDebate moderator Jorge Ramos was among the biggest winners of Thursday night's debate, which says a lot about the tired performances from many of those on stage. He asked tough, substantive questions that put candidate's in uncomfortable positions and forced them to address issues in a way that went beyond what we've already heard from them.\n\nRamos, for example, touched on the Obama administration's record number of deportations and asked Biden why Latinos should trust him.\n\nRamos stood out from the beginning, delivering opening remarks in both English and Spanish, in which he offered a message to Latinos, \"This debate is taking place at very difficult moment for Latinos in Texas and all over the country. That's why it's important they know that we know that this is also our country.\"\n\nHe also did not show a preference for any particular candidate, asking pointed questions of both moderates and those who lean more to the left. Ramos, for example, asked Sanders to explain why he's stopped short of calling Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro a dictator, and asked him to explain what differentiates his democratic socialism from Venezuela's socialism.\n\nRead more: Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist'\n\nHalf of the battle in debates is separating yourself from the pack and getting noticed \u2014 particularly if you're not leading in the polls \u2014 and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro certainly succeeded in that regard with ruthless jabs at Biden throughout the night.\n\nCastro, who served in the Obama administration, went after Biden for leaning on former President Barack Obama's popularity while rejecting criticism of his record: \"He wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer any questions!\"\n\nIn another notable moment, Castro alleged Biden couldn't remember one of his talking points about health care that he made \"two minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\" Castro said.\n\nButtigieg was also a winner on Thursday night with his powerful and personal story of coming out after returning from his deployment in Afghanistan, which is something that's never been seen before on the presidential debate stage. He used the national spotlight to offer the country a human moment, which is increasingly rare among politicians in the present day.\n\nThe losers\n\nBiden took a lot of hits on Thursday night, and struggled to land any significant blows in return. The fact he was targeted by other candidates so much was perhaps the only real sign he's the current frontrunner.\n\nBiden stumbled over his talking points and came off as far too old-fashioned. When Biden was about the about racial inequality in schools, for example, he trailed off into suggesting Americans should \"have the record player on at night\" to help kids learn.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris had a solid first debate in Miami, Florida, that boosted her fundraising and elevated her national profile. But she's been on the decline ever since. Harris struggled in Detroit, and that trend continued into Thursday's debate in Houston.\n\nHarris started off fairly strong on Thursday, going after Trump and ending her opening statement with a joke that the president could \"now go back to watching Fox News.\"\n\nBut she attempted to force several jokes that didn't land over the course of the rest of the debate, such as when she sought to invoke Obama's campaign slogan in a quip at Biden: \"Hey Joe \u2014 instead of saying, 'No we can't' let's say, 'Yes we can.\"\n\nRead more: Kamala Harris says Trump reminds her of the Wizard of Oz: 'When you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude'\n\nWarren and Sanders, both top-tier candidates, were not not necessarily losers or winners on Thursday. They both got a lot of attention early on when the debate focused on health care, but faded from the spotlight as the night went on. Both will likely not gain or lose much from the debate.\n\nThe same could be said of candidates at the middle of the pack like Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who had some strong moments on issues like criminal justice and gun violence, but seemed tired and struggled to set themselves apart on other topics.\n\nMeanwhile, low-tier candidates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang were almost non-existent throughout the night, despite the fact the latter literally offered Americans money at the beginning of the night.\n\nAs the campaign season rages on, we'll see fewer and fewer people on the debate stage. On Thursday night, we saw big signs of who's likely to make it through the next round or two, and who will soon fall out of the race.", "description": "Debate moderator Jorge Ramos was among the biggest winners of Thursday night's debate, which says a lot about the tired performances from candidates.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7b05562e22af1ca93841e5-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
