(Family photo)\n\nColumnist\n\nThey\u2019ve been stranded in India for seven weeks now.\n\nIn a stubborn display of optimism that our country\u2019s dysfunctional immigration system will somehow work, Saurav Mazumdar refuses to buy any new clothes.\n\n\u201cI packed for two weeks. Two shirts, two pants,\u201d said Mazumdar, 42, whose two-week vacation to visit relatives and renew his H1B visa in India has turned into a nightmare.\n\nWhy should he buy more clothes? He has plenty of clothes back home in Washington, where he has lived for almost two decades.\n\nMazumdar, his wife and their two American-born children can\u2019t get back to their home in Northwest Washington, to their jobs, friends or classrooms. They are stuck in a black hole of paperwork and nonanswers from our erratic, broken legal immigration system. You know, the one everyone hating on undocumented immigrants thinks is easy.\n\n\u201cI guess we were naive enough to think this couldn\u2019t happen to us,\u201d said Mazumdar\u2019s wife, Ishita Menon, 41, who holds a PhD from Georgetown University and serves on the special events committee at her son\u2019s D.C. elementary school.\n\nWhile they wait, their kids, Sameer, 6, and Sitara, 11, try to keep up with schoolwork.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to explain to a 6-year-old why he can\u2019t go back home,\u201d Mazumdar said.\n\nSameer goes on FaceTime with his best friend, Owen, once a week. His teacher has sent him pictures from the class, telling him how much they miss him.\n\nSitara, meanwhile, is missing practices with the prestigious youth orchestra she earned a seat in after nailing her audition right before the summer.\n\nMazumdar and Menon came to the United States 19 years ago to get their master\u2019s degrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a lot of countries, but I fell in love with Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that museums are free. And it\u2019s the people who make the difference; the people in the U.S. are amazing. People in the U.S., in general, are well-meaning.\u201d\n\nAnd all of the innovations in his field \u2014 data engineering and artificial intelligence \u2014 were happening in the United States. And he got job offers at the highest levels as coveted brain in this fast-developing area of expertise.\n\n[The kind of immigrant Donald Trump wants is highly skilled]\n\nHe is exactly the kind of immigrant President Trump says he wants: skilled, valued, smart.\n\nMenon loved the District, too. They bought a condo near Washington National Cathedral and had their babies at Georgetown University Hospital.\n\nAnd they were faithful in keeping all their paperwork up-to-date: Mazumdar\u2019s H1B visa, designed for skilled workers, and Menon\u2019s H4 visa, the spousal companion to an H1B. He has to return to India every three years to have his passport restamped and the visa renewed. Every three years, the kids got to see their grandparents and their extended family, and then returned to Washington.\n\nKnowing they wanted to spend the rest of their lives in the United States, the couple applied for green cards eight years ago. That should be fine, right? Any day now, they should be able to raise their right hands and become U.S. citizens.\n\n[For most new citizens, it took years and years to get to this ceremony]\n\nNot so fast.\n\nBecause there\u2019s a major backlog of highly educated, highly skilled people from India seeking green cards, their wait could be anywhere from 75 to 115 years.\n\nYes, years. Preposterous, right?\n\nThis summer, the Democratic-controlled House passed the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, which would help ease that backlog from India in particular. The Republican-controlled Senate is futzing with its own version.\n\nMeanwhile, Mazumdar and Menon are stuck in limbo.\n\nRight after he got to India in July, Mazumdar dropped off his passport and paperwork at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, as he had done many times before.\n\nThe family enjoyed their time, and everything seemed on track when he received an email, eight days later, saying that his passport was ready. Perfect.\n\nBut when he went to pick it up, there was no stamp. Instead, he got a letter saying he needed to come in for an interview. So he went the next day, had a straightforward interview, got fingerprinted and got a document telling him everything was being held up.\n\nThe family canceled their Aug. 13 plane tickets back to Washington and hired an immigration lawyer. They prowl for ideas on online immigration forums, where hundreds of other H1B families are experiencing the same nightmare.\n\nThe State Department keeps returning Mazumdar\u2019s emails with a warning that \u201cbefore making inquiries about status of administrative processing, applicants should wait at least 180 days from the date of interview or submission of supplemental documents, whichever is later.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s six months of school missed. Six months of work missed. Six months in the same two shirts and same two pairs of pants.\n\nAnd even after those six months, there\u2019s no guarantee that this hard-working family will be able to come back home to America.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "This dad went to New Delhi to visit family and renew his visa.
