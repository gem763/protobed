Along with House Republicans who will likely be asked about the impeachment inquiry every time they speak to the media, the president\u2019s team also sent them to some of the Democrats investigating him, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. According to copies of the emails obtained by Yahoo News, about 40 minutes after sending the talking points out, the White House attempted to recall them.\n\nPhoto illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP, via Twitter More\n\nThe talking points urge allies to reiterate that Trump made no promises to Zelensky and that he didn\u2019t bring up his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, until his Ukrainian counterpart brought him up.\n\nThe White House memo summarizing the conversation, released to the public a few hours before, shows that Trump sought Zelensky\u2019s cooperation as a \u201cfavor,\u201d but does not contain a specific offer of a quid pro quo. At the time, much-needed American military aid for Ukraine had been held up for unexplained reasons, reportedly at the request of the White House.\n\nThe completeness of the memo cannot be independently verified. The White House referred to it as a transcript, but the document itself states it is \u201cnot a verbatim transcript of a discussion\u201d but rather \u201cthe notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and [National Security Council] policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told MSNBC that the White House had called Republicans in Congress to look over the memo and go over talking points before its release.\n\nHere's a screenshot of the White House asking House Democrats to please disregard the talking points on Trump/Ukraine they just emailed them pic.twitter.com/55HgOESWyL \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 25, 2019\n\nCongress has called for the White House to release the details of a complaint by an unnamed whistleblower in the intelligence community, related to Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, that is the basis of the impeachment investigation announced by Pelosi Tuesday.\n\nHunter Walker contributed to this story.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The White House accidentally sent its anti-impeachment talking points intended for allies in Congress to House Democrats.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jJgKcfOL3vdfTToniDAfpQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/7d087920-dfb6-11e9-bbef-c37a4e7a6929", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
