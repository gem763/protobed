(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nThe Atlanta Braves got back on track in Game 2 of the National League Division Series.\n\nBehind a strong pitching effort from Mike Foltynewicz, timely hitting from Josh Donaldson and a pinch-hit blast from Adam Duvall, the Braves were able to even the series with a 3-0 win against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe game had an old school postseason feel as Foltynewicz and Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty matched zeroes for most of the afternoon. The Braves scratched out a first-inning run when Ozzie Albies singled and was wild pitched into scoring position. Donaldson was able to cash him in with a two-out single.\n\nThat stood as the game\u2019s lone run until pinch hitter Adam Duvall smacked a two-out home run against Flaherty in the seventh inning.\n\nFoltynewicz was nothing short of brilliant. The 27-year-old right-hander shut St. Louis out over his seven innings, allowing just three hits while striking out seven. On the rare occasion he did face trouble, Foltynewicz made a big pitch to escape. That included inducing an inning-ending double play from Kolten Wong in the seventh.\n\nFlaherty carried his strong regular season into the postseason by tossing six-innings of one-run ball. His effort kept St. Louis in the game, but unlike Game 1 the Cardinals offense was unable to capitalize.\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u2022 Mike Foltynewicz: \"Folty\" picked a great day to pitch the game of his life. He became the first Braves starting pitcher to complete five innings in a postseason start since Freddy Garcia in Game 4 of the 2013 NLDS. In the five games in between, Atlanta\u2019s starters totaled just 18 innings.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2022 Adam Duvall: The veteran outfielder has been up and down between Atlanta and Triple A over the last two seasons. But Duvall was ready to deliver when Brian Snitker called his number in a pinch. His 3-2, two-out home run cemented the victory for Atlanta.\n\nAdam Duvall's homer was the Braves' 1st postseason HR on a 3-2, 2-out pitch in exactly 16 years.\n\n\n\nChipper Jones hit a 2-run HR vs. Cubs on a 3-2, 2-out pitch in Game 4 of the NLDS on Oct. 4, 2003. \u2014 Paul Casella (@paul_casella) October 4, 2019\n\n\u2022 Jack Flaherty: The breakout season continues. Flaherty posted an MLB-best 0.91 ERA in 15 starts after the All-Star break, and looked every bit as good in his postseason debut. He made one big mistake in the seventh inning and it cost him. Otherwise, he deserves a big tip of the cap.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nThe postseason spotlight shined on Adam Duvall, and he delivered.\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nBased on their 2019 results, it was fair to wonder if Braves manager Brian Snitker made the right decision starting Mike Foltynewicz over ace Mike Soroka in what was nearly a must-win. There's no questioning it now. Foltynewicz, who was demoted to Triple-A during the season, provided an ace-like performance himself. The outing helped Atlanta win a game where St. Louis could have taken command of the series.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThe series continues Sunday in St. Louis with a pivotal Game 3. The Cardinals will look to maintain home-field advantage with veteran Adam Wainwright (14-10, 4.19) on the hill. The Braves will counter with their ace, Mike Soroka (13-4, 2.68). First pitch is scheduled for 4:10 p.m. ET.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Atlanta Braves defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0 in Game 2 of the NLDS.
