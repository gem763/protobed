A bearded man is seen dancing, wading in and out of the crowd with fish-like motions.\n\nThe \u201cBaby Shark\u201d song has been popularized by a video uploaded to YouTube by a South Korean children\u2019s educational company called Pinkfong in 2016. It has become one of the most-watched videos on the platform, with over 3.7 billion views.\n\nProtesters in Lebanon are angry about the state of the economy, corruption and public services, but the \u2018Baby Shark\u2019 episode brought a moment of relief from the wave of dissent, and a uniting rallying cry.\n\nVideos posted on Twitter on Sunday showed demonstrators waving Lebanese national flags, letting off flares and singing the catchy song.\n\nDemonstrators carry national flags during an anti-government protest in Tripoli, Lebanon October 22, 2019.
