I want to enjoy the blessing I've been given.'\n\nDue to their premature birth, the babies are not yet crawling, and only began sitting up six weeks ago.\n\nMs Britten added: 'They will be mobile soon, but it doesn't bother me. I've got a big playpen and I will use that for when I need to go and do something in the house.'", "description": "Tracey Britten,\u00a0who was raised in Preston but now lives in London, hit the headlines last year when she gave birth to four IVF tots at 31 weeks.
