While bookings in its machining solutions arm, which caters to mainly industrial clients, fell 9%, its mining unit posted a 5% rise.\n\nAmid the industrial slowdown, Sandvik said it expected to make deeper cost cuts, which were now seen at 1.7 billion crowns compared to its previous guidance of 1.4 billion, with most kicking in fully around the middle of next year.\n\nSandvik shares, which were flat ahead of the results, rose 1.9% at 1017 GMT.\n\nThe company, which has struggled historically to safeguard profitability during cyclical downturns, has been restructured under Rosengren\u2019s tenure with the sale of a string of businesses seen as outside its core and decentralization across the group.", "description": "Metal-cutting tools and mining gear maker Sandvik reported third-quarter core earnings above market forecasts on Friday as strong demand in the mining and oil industries helped offset slumping automotive and engineering markets.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
