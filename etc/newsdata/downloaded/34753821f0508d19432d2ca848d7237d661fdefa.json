During the call, the Ukrainian president agreed to investigations of Biden and his son Hunter Biden's tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The aid was later provided.\n\nU.S. law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nFriday's subpoenas also called on two officials from the White House's Office of Management and Budget: acting director Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs, to testify in early November.\n\nLawmakers want Duffey to appear on Nov 5, and Vought and Brechbuhl on Nov 6, the committees said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to block current and former officials from appearing before the impeachment inquiry, although the Democrat-led committees have obliged main figures in the scandal, like U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, to testify by issuing subpoenas against them.\n\nPUBLIC HEARINGS\n\nThe impeachment inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges - known as articles of impeachment - which would prompt a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. The Senate is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, who have shown little inclination toward removing him.\n\nBut Trump has pressured Republicans to adopt a more robust defense in recent days after two of his recent decisions - the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and the now-reversed move to hold a G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts - drew criticism from members of his party.\n\nThe White House is considering former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to handle its communications for the impeachment probe, a person familiar with the deliberations said.\n\nCongressional Democrats, faced with stepped-up efforts by Trump's Republican allies to disrupt the impeachment inquiry, are now considering calling only career government employees to testify at public hearings expected to start later next month, according to congressional sources.\n\nMeanwhile, a U.S. Justice Department review of the origins of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is now a criminal investigation, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr launched a review earlier this year to investigate Trump's complaints that his campaign was improperly targeted by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies during the election.\n\nDemocrats and some former law enforcement officials say Barr is using the Justice Department to chase unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that could benefit the Republican president politically and discredit former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report about the investigation.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday issued three more subpoenas as part of their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, seeking to compel top officials in the White House budget office and the State Department to testify.
