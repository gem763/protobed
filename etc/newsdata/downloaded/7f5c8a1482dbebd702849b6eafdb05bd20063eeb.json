What\u2019s your ETA? \u2014 Melissa Chan (@melissachanhk) September 2, 2019\n\nHey @Tesla. I love my new Model 3... but now the app won\u2019t refresh, won\u2019t let me sign in, and says I have no vehicle. I\u2019ve been on hold for tech support for an hour. Is my new car a red brick already? \u2014 Ethlie Ann Vare (@ethlie) September 3, 2019\n\n@elonmusk @Tesla locked out. Phone app doesn\u2019t respond. Signed out and signed back in but it says no cars in the account. \u2014 BuffalloWarrior (@_karthik1107) September 3, 2019\n\nA Tesla spokesperson confirmed to Gizmodo that Tesla\u2019s app was temporarily unavailable on Tuesday but full functionality was soon restored. Tweets suggest the app was down for around three hours at least.\n\nThe company clarified that Tesla owners were still able to access their Model 3 with their physical key fob or key cards, which the company encourages owners to carry in the event that they lose their phone or it dies.\n\nOwners were also able to gain access to and start their cars through their mobile devices if they had activated the phone-as-key function, which uses Bluetooth Low Energy to connect with the car and doesn\u2019t rely on the app.\n\nHowever, Model 3 owners who don\u2019t carry a key fob or key card, and don\u2019t use the phone-as-key feature, and who only use the Tesla in-app lock and unlock feature that requires mobile signals will be temporarily screwed when the app fails.\n\nTo recap, before the digital age, we had keys. They were made of metal, were unique, and they worked wonderfully. Today, Tesla has four forms of entry and you need to keep up with all of them in case your preferred method encounters technical difficulties. Is that more difficult than keeping track of your keys? Not necessarily. Is it a sign that not everything needs to be disrupted? One could certainly make a good argument to that effect.", "description": "Some Tesla users who rely on the app to gain entry to their Model 3 were temporarily unable to get into their electric cars on Tuesday....", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Gizmodo Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/c6nu0st7ttnhi0sh4cr2.jpg"}
