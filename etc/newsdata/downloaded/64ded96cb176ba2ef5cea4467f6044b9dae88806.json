Swiftmile, which just landed a contract with the city of Austin, supplies cities and private operators with docks equipped to park and charge both scooters and e-bikes.\n\nWhat Swiftmile offers serves as a win for operators, riders and cities alike. Operators can provide a better (charged) product to their customers, the likelihood of finding a charged scooter increases and cities can better control sidewalk clutter and issues pertaining to improper parking. Unfortunately, the downside falls on those relying on charging scooters to make extra income.\n\nWhen Swiftmile deploys in Austin, the plan is to start with 10 stations, which comes out to about 80 parking slips. The company hopes to do this by the end of the year. Austin has become a major micromobility hub, with seven providers operating a total of 17,600 vehicles in the city. In fact, it\u2019s become known as a place that many other cities look to for regulation.\n\n\u201cWhat we do with cities is we get permission from them, we get an encroachment permit and then it\u2019s up to us to monetize off the scooter providers,\u201d Swiftmile co-founder and CEO Colin Roche told TechCrunch. \u201cWhat we do is put our system down and, you can think of it like a gas station in the middle of where all the scooters are. You don\u2019t want a lot of people having to drive in to pick all these scooters up. I think that\u2019s going to diminish more. If the asset is in the field right there, then you incentivize a rider to ride to the station with credit.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Swiftmile charges the operators by the minute, but not to exceed a certain amount, depending on the market. Initially, the docking system will be open to all operators in order to show them how it works and how beneficial it can be. After a certain period of time, Swiftmile will only charge its customers\u2019 scooters.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1900988,1900989,1900990\"]\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the key piece,\u201d Roche said. \u201cOur system is really intelligent, so we have the ability to detect whose scooter it is. When it gets plugged in, we pulse the system and it tells us what kind of scooter it is.\u201d\n\nThat makes it so a rider could still park any scooter there, but only Swiftmile customers will get their scooters charged.\n\nIn addition to Austin, Swiftmile has also launched a mobility hub in Berlin, and plans to deploy more. On the operator side, Swiftmile has partnered with Spin to create branded charging hubs exclusively for Spin scooters. In the U.S., Swiftmile has deployed more than 50 stations. In Austin, however, the charging hubs are vehicle agnostic and will mark Swiftmile\u2019s first public system.\n\nThe same will go for Pittsburgh, where Swiftmile will deploy about 50 stations in early 2020. That\u2019s all part of the Pittsburgh Micromobility Collective, which includes Spin, Zipcar, Ford Mobility, Waze and Swiftmile.\n\nSwiftmile got its start as a bike-share operator for private companies, including Tesla and Google. To date, the company has raised a little more than $5 million from Sinai Ventures, Verizon Ventures and others. Additionally, Swiftmile just received a term sheet for a $12 million Series A round.\n\n*Verizon owns TechCrunch, but has no influence on our coverage.", "description": "Anyone who has tried to ride an electric scooter knows the likelihood of finding one with a charged battery is quite low.
