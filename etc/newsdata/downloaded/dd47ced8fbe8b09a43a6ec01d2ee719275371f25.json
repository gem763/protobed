If the vote is approved, France is expected to agree to the January 31 \u2018flextension'\n\nEU member states met in Brussels yesterday to consider rubber stamping the UK\u2019s request for the three-month delay, which Boris Johnson was forced into by MPs.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron wants to wait until after Monday\u2019s Commons vote on whether to hold a general election in December\n\nDuring what were described as a \u2018lively\u2019 exchange, France stood firm against the other 26 remaining member states and stopped any decision being taken.\n\nOne EU diplomat said: \u2018It was a lively meeting. It was 26 vs 1. France was the only country that wouldn\u2019t agree it. Other member states told them they were playing a very dangerous game. They were being very rigid and their strategy is risky and increases the chances of an accidental No Deal.\u2019 A decision on the extension length may be taken as late as Tuesday morning \u2013 two days before the UK is due to leave.\n\nBut if Labour blocks it, France does not want an extension beyond November 30, to pressure MPs into a resolution.\n\nMr Macron is worried that a three-month delay will be wasted if an election does not take place and if Mr Johnson cannot get his deal through the Commons. A second EU diplomat said: \u2018France was saying, \u201clet\u2019s wait until the UK clarifies its position concerning a general election\u201d.\n\n\u2018Other countries are saying, \u201clet\u2019s not get involved in internal UK politics\u201d. There was a lot of frustration.\u2019\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson at Milton Keynes University Hospital. Mr Johnson was forced into asking for a delay until January 31 under the terms of the Benn Act\n\nMember states are still aiming to grant an extension via \u2018written procedure\u2019 early next week. But if France does not fall into line by Tuesday morning, EU leaders may be forced to hold an eleventh-hour summit to thrash out a compromise \u2013 most likely on Wednesday night, the day before Brexit day on October 31.\n\nA source yesterday said EU Council chief Donald Tusk, whose job it is to organise summits, has \u2018no intention\u2019 of calling a special summit and wants an extension agreed by member states via the written process.The idea behind the \u2018flextension\u2019 is that January 31 would be the maximum possible delay. But it could also end early if and when MPs pass the withdrawal bill, which would put Mr Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal into law.\n\nJeremy Corbyn pictured leaving his London home yesterday. By meddling with the request as laid out in the Act, Mr Johnson would be placed under a different set of obligations. But if January 31 is offered, he must agree to it\n\nIf they do, Britain could leave on the first day of the month after ratification. Boris Johnson said he would give MPs until around November 6 to debate his deal, allowing Britain to leave on December 1.\n\nbrexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.\n\nAfter briefing the member states yesterday, the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who also argued in favour of the flexible January 31 deadline, said an \u2018excellent\u2019 discussion had taken place but confirmed that \u2018no decision\u2019 was reached.\n\nA third diplomat from a major EU country said: \u2018We hope we reach a consensus because if we don\u2019t by Tuesday morning we have the high possibility of having a summit. As January 31 was what was asked for by the UK, the 26 countries said they could agree to it and that\u2019s what would be best for avoiding an accidental No Deal, which a shorter delay raises the chances of.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson was forced into asking for a delay until January 31 under the terms of the Benn Act.\n\nThe EU is worried that changing the terms of the delay request under the legislation and offering a shorter date could raise the risk of No Deal.\n\nBy meddling with the request as laid out in the Act, Mr Johnson would be placed under a different set of obligations. But if January 31 is offered, he must agree to it.\n\nAn EU Commission spokesman said: \u2018The EU27 have agreed to the principle of an extension and work will now continue in the coming days.
