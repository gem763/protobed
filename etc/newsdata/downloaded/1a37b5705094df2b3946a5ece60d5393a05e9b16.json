We\u2019ll see partly to mostly sunny skies as highs reach the low to mid-90s. Feeling more like the mid-90s to near 100 with the high humidity (dew points in the upper 60s to low 70s). An area of heavy showers and storms could develop and move through from west to east around 4 to 9 p.m. Confidence: Medium\n\nTonight: That potential area of heavy showers and storms could still be moving through from west to east until 9 p.m. or so. A few more showers or storms remain possible late evening or overnight. Otherwise it\u2019s partly cloudy and muggy, with lows mainly in the low to mid-70s. Confidence: Medium\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock.

Highs head for near 90 to the low 90s, and a cold front coming from the north could spark more showers and storms in the late afternoon or evening. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Still muggy with scattered showers and storms possible during the evening and overnight, as the front continues to move through from north to south. Lows drop mainly to the upper 60s to near 70. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nWith an onshore breeze from the east, Friday is a mostly cloudy and much cooler day with highs in the 70s. Could see a few light showers during the day and into the evening, despite the somewhat lower humidity (dew points in the mid-60s). Confidence: Medium-High\n\nAnother cold front approaches Saturday and could stall nearby on Sunday. Both days look decent for outdoor activities, but also can\u2019t rule out a few scattered showers and storms either day. Highs aim for the warmer 80s to near 90, with humidity trending higher again as well.
