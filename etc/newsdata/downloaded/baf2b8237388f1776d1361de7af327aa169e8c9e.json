The case itself named both Vance and Trump accounting firm Mazars as defendants. It was listed on the docket in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nVance's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nVance\u2019s subpoena for the president\u2019s tax returns, first reported earlier this week by The New York Times, came after the Justice Department's decision earlier this summer to conclude its own investigation into some of the same issues.\n\nAlready, Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has received a three-year prison term as a result of the investigations into the Trump campaign's finances. Trump himself was implicated in Cohen's crimes, which prosecutors have said were centered around payments made to silence several women in the heat of the presidential election.\n\nTrump's newest lawsuit is now one of many swirling around the issue of his tax returns.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal has a case in court seeking Trump\u2019s federal tax returns, though it is still in its early stages. A district court judge rejected Democrats\u2019 bid to fast-track the case, and Trump is now countering with a motion to dismiss the suit.\n\nA separate suit in which Trump is suing Neal to prevent him from tapping a New York law to obtain his state returns has bogged down in a jurisdictional dispute over whether the case ought to be heard in Washington, D.C., or in New York City.\n\nBrian Faler contributed to this report, which first appeared on politico.com on Sept. 19, 2019.", "description": "The lawsuit is a response to a subpoena the New York District Attorney filed last month seeking eight years of Trump's personal and corporate tax returns.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f5/4e/09c8058b47219632c05cc0beb86d/180413-donald-trump-gty-1160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
