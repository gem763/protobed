Will Smith gets to live that dream with Gemini Man, a production that\u2019s been worked on for 20 years (at one point Sean Connery would have starred) but had to wait for technology to catch up with its premise.\n\nIt also offers a tantalising premise on the poster \u2013 a fight between 51-year-old Smith and his early 90\u2019s self.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith plays Harry, an assassin in his fifties who has seen too much death and plans to retire.\n\nOut of nowhere, a mysterious figure starts hunting him, who turns out to be a young clone of himself (also Smith, with some motion capture trickery). Harry now must seek out his former boss (Clive Owen), the man behind all this, and avoid his younger self\u2019s bullets without killing both of them.\n\nWill Smith fights himself in Gemini Man (Image: Paramount Pictures)\n\nIt\u2019s strange to see this type of film in cinemas, as it feels like a 90s action movie with its elaborate set pieces and exotic locations.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not a good example of one, as beyond the inventive premise there really isn\u2019t much to enjoy.\n\nWill Smith is convincing as both his older and younger self, but it\u2019s not enough to save a dull story (Image: Paramount Pictures)\n\nThe script is painfully dull, with lines that shouldn\u2019t have made it past the first draft (at one point Smith tells his colleague \u2018it\u2019s not Gun Time, it\u2019s Coffee Time\u2019. Seriously). It\u2019s a straightforward chase with the older Smith using all his star power to try and make the stakes seem higher than they are. He elevates the action slightly, but not enough to make it enjoyable.\n\nAs for his young co-star, it\u2019s startling to see Smith in his early 20s come back to life so vividly.\n\nClearly, an awful lot of groundbreaking work has gone into making him as realistic as possible, it\u2019s just a shame not as much time was spent on the character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from some very forced signaling about his immaturity (he likes cereal and ice cream cones), it\u2019s basically a blander version of Older Smith, and the two coming together does nothing beyond the initial \u2018oohs\u2019 and \u2018ahhs\u2019 of the effect.\n\nElsewhere, Clive Owen is all scowls as the villain. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is interesting as a fellow operative drawn into Henry\u2019s plight, and refreshingly she\u2019s a partner who\u2019s as capable as he is, rather than a damsel in distress. Sadly, due to the dry script, she\u2019s often there to find out what Smith is thinking.\n\nFlimsy and predictable, Gemini Man is far from the best work of either Lee or Smith. It is a two-dimensional action film that seems more preoccupied with creating a gimmick and not telling a compelling story.\n\nWho wins in a fight between two Will Smiths? Certainly not the audience.\n\nGemini Man is in UK cinemas 11 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
