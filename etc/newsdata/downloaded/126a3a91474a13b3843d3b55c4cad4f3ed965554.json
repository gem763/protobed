Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) claimed during the fourth Democrat debate that the pursuit of impeachment is necessary because President Trump broke the law \u201cover and over.\u201d\n\nCNN and the New York Times opened the fourth Democrat debate with impeachment. Moderator Anderson Cooper asked Warren why the House Democrats\u2019 pursuit of impeachment is necessary, particularly with the presidential election right around the corner.\n\n\u201cWith the election only one year away, why shouldn\u2019t it be the voters who determine the president\u2019s fate? \u201d Cooper asked.\n\n\u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry,\u201d Warren said.\n\nWarren said she \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t think\u201d impeachment would be a subject of interest when she decided to run for president but claimed the Mueller report \u2013 which did not show any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 convinced her that Trump \u201cobstructed justice and done it repeatedly,\u201d despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.\n\nWarren continued:\n\nAt that moment, I called for an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn\u2019t happen, and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer. Broke it again this fall. You know we took a Constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.\n\nThe impeachment must go forward,\u201d she added.", "description": "Sen.
