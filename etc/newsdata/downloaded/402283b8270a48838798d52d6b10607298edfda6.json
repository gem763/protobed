The Speaker, John Bercow, allowed the motion led by the Tory MP Oliver Letwin, and it was passed by 328 votes to 301.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe bill, signed by MPs including Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, will now be debated, and one plan is to push the bill through all its Commons stages in a single day. It would then move to the Lords, where peers have been trying to clear space for it on Thursday. The rebels\u2019 aim is to secure royal assent \u2013 making the bill a law \u2013 before parliament is suspended next week.\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nBy saying it will seek an election. Boris Johnson said the \u201conly way to resolve this\u201d would be for the government to table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which allows five-year parliaments to be broken if two-thirds of MPs back an election.\n\nPlay Video 2:03 Johnson says he will seek snap election after losing crucial vote \u2013 video\n\nWill an election happen, and when?\n\nYes, even if not straight away, it seems. The two-thirds majority means the government requires Labour votes, and Jeremy Corbyn told MPs his party would only back an election once the bill to block no-deal Brexit completes its passage through the Commons. So any vote on Wednesday would be expected to fail. With the precise date to prorogue parliament still not fixed, the government could allow time for a second attempt, perhaps on Monday. Mooted election dates include 14 or 15 October.\n\nWho rebelled for the Conservatives, and what happens to them?\n\nThere were 21 rebels \u2013 at the very top end of estimates \u2013 including party grandees and ex-ministers Kenneth Clarke, Philip Hammond, David Gauke, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve. No 10 had promised that any Tories who voted for the motion would immediately lose the party whip and be barred from standing at the next election, and government sources said this would happen. This means the government very much no longer has a majority \u2013 and in theory has to select 21 new parliamentary candidates at top speed.\n\nCan the government block or ignore the bill?\n\nThe clear majority for the measure to proceed would appear to indicate that it will also pass, and it seems unlikely ministers could find a way to somehow delay it or deny royal assent. Ministers, notably Michael Gove, had hinted the government could simply ignore an instruction to extend Brexit, even one in law. Johnson did tell the Commons this would not happen, but he then stressed he had no intention of seeking an extension, with his aim instead to call and win a general election.", "description": "Move to block no-deal Brexit leaves government without a majority and heading to polls", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2ca01f6390e07433d1d4b41b37ff79675a29c1/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e98cfb0720476870f124a3be82a22af"}
