This year\u2019s meeting will be held next week at Washington\u2019s Hotel Fairmont.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s proposed ban, the group said in a statement that there was no evidence that vaping is to blame for recent cases of lung illness and urged the president to reverse course before \u201csmall businesses around the country are forced to close their doors, and tens of thousands of people are laid off.\u201d\n\nAnticipating such criticism, Trump appeared to walk a line Wednesday between acknowledging the wealth created by the burgeoning industry and the growing health dangers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve become very rich companies very fast. The whole thing with vaping is \u2026 it\u2019s been very profitable,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t allow people to get sick, and we can\u2019t have our youth to be so affected.\u201d\n\nThe Vapor Technology Association has spent $678,000 on federal campaigns in the past three years, with Juul pitching in $3.7 million more.\n\nLast year, Juul hired former Trump communications aide Josh Raffel and, earlier this year, Johnny DeStefano, who served as counselor to the president.\n\nAmong those lobbying on Juul\u2019s behalf are Jim Esquea, who worked during the Obama administration as an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Ted McCann, who was a top policy aide to former House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nThe 2017 vaping conference at the Trump International Hotel in Washington featured a keynote address from Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican pushing the Food and Drug Administration to pull back on a 2016 rule requiring e-cigarette makers get federal approval.\n\nTen days later, the FDA did just that, announcing that manufacturers of e-cigarettes and cigars already on the market would get a reprieve of four years - since changed to three years - before they would be required to get agency approval.\n\nTony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, told the AP last year that it was \u201coverly simplistic\u201d to suggest the event at Trump\u2019s hotel had anything to do with the FDA delay.\n\nIn June last year, the group held a second two-day conference at Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, with speakers lined up to talk about such topics as \u201cending improper marketing,\u201d \u201dreclaiming the public health narrative\u201d and \u201cdefending flavors.\u201d\n\nThe keynote speaker, then-U.S. Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, was quoted by the business magazine Fast Company as saying that the industry needed to talk about jobs if they hoped to fight off regulation.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing elected officials want to be on the right side of, it\u2019s job creation,\u201d Costello said. \u201cLead with: improved public health outcomes from those switching, and then the economic impact. How many jobs will this legislation cost? How many small businesses will close? That\u2019s what legislators need to know.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Matthew Perrone contributed to this report from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "America's vaping industry has in recent years taken its fight to fend off regulation directly to President Donald Trump's doorstep, with a lobbying group twice booking annual meetings at his Washington hotel and e-cigarette maker Juul hiring two of his former White House officials.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernard Condon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/trump_vaping_10324_c0-206-4913-3070_s1770x1032.jpg?9f367696536513b0d3f032fc27821999ecf2d553", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
