But at least one, from Trump\u2019s deep past, has not been previously aired: that, in the \u201980s, he frequented a Mafia-run VIP sex club in Times Square, and once demanded a threesome with a porn star and a young-looking female.\n\nThe allegation centers on interviews with one self-proclaimed eyewitness, a former mobster named John Tino. But neither of the two women supposedly involved in the incident could be located by the authors\u2014which leaves the charge in the hands of a man whose criminal record includes convictions for larceny, fraud, and forgery. Even the authors admit their account is hardly airtight, while nonetheless defending their work. \u201cThere are many people who will label Tino a liar and say his claims are false. I came away feeling his allegations are believable,\u201d one of the authors, Barry Levine, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests to comment for this article, but Trump in the past has strongly denied any allegations of sexual impropriety. \u201cThat book is trash, and those accusations from 20 years ago have been addressed many times,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to Business Insider about All the President\u2019s Women.\n\nTino swears he remembers Trump as \u201cthe real estate guy\u201d during his years as hired muscle for the sex den, which he says was run by a notorious crime boss. In the book, to be published Tuesday, Levine and co-author Monique El-Faizy write that the secret club was allegedly frequented by rich and powerful men, including Trump. \u201cMost of the women who worked there were porn stars, though not all. Trump preferred a woman who primarily performed live sex shows with her husband, though she acted in the occasional adult film as well,\u201d the authors state.\n\nTino says in All the President\u2019s Women that Trump always \u201cwore a tie and never drank alcohol.\u201d Trump\u2014who was married at the time to his first wife, Ivana\u2014allegedly always asked for the same woman, whom Tino had nicknamed \u201cTri.\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 1982, according to Tino, his boss called and asked to see him. \u201cThe real estate guy is coming,\u201d the boss said, in Tino\u2019s telling. \u201cHe wants Tri and he wants another girl\u2026 for a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois.\u2019\u201d\n\nTino said his role at the club was to watch the hidden cameras that monitored each room, to ensure none of the women were \u201croughed up\u201d during their liaisons. He would then collect the tapes that were recorded in black-and-white.\n\nThe book claims that one night, a young-looking female showed up at the club. According to Tino, \u201cTri asked the girl how old she was. She said she was a teenager,\u201d without elaborating whether or not she was above the legal age of consent. The book states that \u201cthe real estate guy\u201d spent an hour in the room.\n\nThe book also contains allegations from a woman named Karen Johnson, who alleges that Trump forcibly grabbed her \u201cin the pussy\u201d at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s and then kissed her against her will. That allegation echoes Trump\u2019s comments on the now infamous Access Hollywood tape where he boasted to Billy Bush how, \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy.\u201d\n\nPorn star Alana Evans also claims in the book she knows of at least three former porn stars who say they were paid to have sex with Trump. (Evans first told The Daily Beast in the fall of 2016 that Trump propositioned her and Stormy Daniels for a threesome.)\n\nThe alleged Times Square episode was much more difficult to verify, the authors of the book admit. The infamous Mob boss referred to in All the President\u2019s Women was murdered in 1986 and the book provides limited evidence of the so-called Times Square VIP sex club\u2019s existence. The videotapes referred to in the book have never been found. Despite exhaustive efforts by private investigators and reporters over recent years, both \u201cTri\u201d and the \u201cteenager\u201d have never been located.\n\nLevine acknowledges that several journalists tried and failed to confirm Tino\u2019s explosive claims during the 2016 election and, like him, tried unsuccessfully to find the porn star involved. \u201cTo this day we don\u2019t know if the porn star involved in this alleged incident is still alive or whether she is dead,\u201d Levine told The Daily Beast.\n\nLevine acknowledged that Trump supporters may not accept certain sections of the book as true.\n\n\u201cIn this polarized society you have, and we interviewed many women who support Trump and blame the women and the victim, a great portion of the country sides with Trump but when you look at the facts they support the allegation,\u201d Levine said.\n\nIn a long authors\u2019 note that accompanies the Times S quare allegations, Levine talks about his efforts to corroborate Tino\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cOver the months, through dozens of calls only to find that most of the people who associated with Tino are dead\u2014either from natural causes or victims of mob violence themselves\u2014I was able to locate two individuals who confirmed [Tino\u2019s] work at the secretive sex den. Both of these individuals specifically remembered him by his mob nickname, \u2018Blue Eyes.\u2019\n\n\u201cOne of the individuals, who is in his late eighties, said of Tino: \u2018I remember \u2018Blue Eyes\u2019 from the office. He worked for us. He would come by. [\u2014] had him running a place in Times Square.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, Levine added, \u201cdespite efforts made by me and two private investigators\u2014along with other reporters I spoke to who worked the story\u2014I was unable to find \u2018Tri\u2019 or confirm whether she was still alive.\n\n\u201cI also conducted interviews with people in the mob-associated porn business specific to the Times Square sex scene in the early 1980s\u2014not one of them knew for a fact what happened to this woman.\u201d\n\nThe claims in All the Presidents Women are sure to be controversial, not least of all because Trump has always steadfastly denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and called the women making them \u201cliars.\u201d\n\nTino, who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, told the authors he doesn\u2019t want to take what he allegedly witnessed that night between Trump, the porn star \u201cTri,\u201d and the \u201cteenager\u201d to his grave.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you this now,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cHe\u2019s the president.\u201d", "description": "A new book levels 43 allegations of inappropriate behavior by President Trump\u2014including a controversial one from the early 1980s that has never before been aired.", "authors": ["Lachlan Cartwright", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571364343/191018-cartwright-trump-times-square-hero_kh2hgp", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
