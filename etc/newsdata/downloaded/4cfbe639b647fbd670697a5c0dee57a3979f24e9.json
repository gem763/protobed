The idea was that it would help parents share up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of statutory pay between them after the birth of their baby and allow couples to take a more equal role in looking after their child.\n\nHowever, the number of dads actually taking up SPL is still staggeringly low.\n\nA report by PowWowNow found that just one in 10 fathers have taken Shared Parental Leave since its introduction in 2015.\n\nDads are missing out on time with their children because employers aren\u2019t telling new-dads-to-be about their SPL rights, unless they request it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, nearly half (46%) of fathers admit they do not feel comfortable broaching the topic of SPL with their employer while three quarters of fathers say there is a cultural stigma around new dads taking time off work to look after their children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome have been told they cannot take the leave \u2013 only to find later that they can, but they\u2019ve had to fight for it.\n\nMany do not know that the leave can be overlapped \u2013 it does not need to be taken as a tag team. It offers the possibility of each parent taking a chunk of SPL with some crossover that enables them to spend time as a new family.\n\nWe\u2019ve found three dads who not only made full use of their SPL, but did so in style. Here\u2019s how they did it\u2026\n\n1. Paul, Brighton \u2013 Overlapped SPL with wife for 10 weeks travelling in Asia when baby Wilbur was 4 months old\n\nPaul styling it out on a dive boat between the Gili Islands during his two months of SPL (Picture: Paul Thomas)\n\nOur attitude is that people have babies all over the world and, if you\u2019re scared of the unknown, you\u2019ll miss out on so many experiences.\n\n\u2018When I found out about the new legislation into SPL I jumped at the chance. My wife, Emma, wanted me to experience being at the front end of parenting and to be able to bond properly with Wilbur and this allowed me to do that. The legislation allows you to take several periods off from work and swap between parents, however we chose to only take one period each and overlap.\n\nWilbur was born in May 2017 and we got married the following September, so going travelling with a tot was our honeymoon. We went away for 10 weeks in total, when Wilbs was four to six months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLots of research was done. I was more into the \u2018big ideas\u2019, where to go etc, while Emma was much more into the practicalities which I thanked her for later. Top tip: invest in a good quality lightweight pushchair and travel cot.\n\nWe ended up flying to Kuala Lumpur, Bali, the Gili Islands, Perth, and then Goa on the way back. The pace of travelling wasn\u2019t what it would be without a baby. We planned three or four days in each spot, spent a bit more on accommodation and didn\u2019t engage in any extreme sports, but did our fair share of tours.\n\nEmma breastfeeding at a beach bar in Bali (Picture: Paul Thomas)\n\nEmma was well on it with breast feeding which made the whole trip more viable. And our panic of Asia not having nappies was unfounded. Funny that \u2013 they have babies too.\n\nThere were some hairy moments. Unless you are super organised you will be holding your baby on your lap in the back of a taxi rather than using a child seat. And one shower chucked very hot water over Wilbs\u2019s nether parts. We had a heart attack, but, thank God, there was no lasting damage, but it still haunts us to this day. Always check the temperature every 2 effing seconds!\n\nBut our attitude is that people have babies all over the world and, if you\u2019re scared of the unknown, you\u2019ll miss out on so many experiences.\n\nWe funded our time away with contributions from our lovely wedding guests and AirBnB-ing our flat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we plan to do again this year (minus the wedding) as baby number two is due in October. Wilbur is now in full toddler mode, so we may have to tweak the logistics a bit but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll muddle through. Africa is on the cards this time.\u2019\n\n2. Matt, London \u2013 3.5 months SPL following wife\u2019s 8.5 months, spent as stay-at-home when baby Aaron was 8 months old\n\nMatt and Aaron hanging out with friends are a local caf\u00e9 during his three and a half months of SPL (Picture: Matt Arnold)\n\nI was asked how \u2018being mummy\u2019 was going. There\u2019s a long way to go for it to be seen as normal. SPL is the best thing I did around the birth of our baby, Aaron. When my wife, Ashton, told me we were expecting a baby at the end of 2017, I had a vague awareness of SPL. It helped that I work for a childcare company, sympathetic to the needs of parents. I was able to take three and a half months leave, encompassing our son Aaron\u2019s journey from an eight month old to a nursery-attending, toddler-nearing 11 months. It\u2019s been one of the happiest times of my life. There\u2019s no doubt I got the thick end of the wedge. Just as I was primed for the sleepless nights to come that Ashton had been enduring, Aaron slept through the night for the first time on our \u2018handover week\u2019. I took the reins at a time when the laughs come freely and you feel you\u2019re getting a lot back from them. There\u2019s less layers to work through with nappy changes in the summer and pub gardens seem more attractive in June than in January. I also had two of my good mates with babies born a week either side of Aaron who were taking time off at the same time. We\u2019re fortunate to live in an area with unbelievable provision for babies. Matt soon shrugged off the novelty of being a stay-at-home dad and went with the flow (Picture: Matt Arnold) I discovered a side to our pocket of South West London that I\u2019d never given a second thought to. Pubs, bars and brunches became children centres. It turns out a lot of baby groups really are in pubs. I loved the sense of community that I felt I unearthed. I realised pretty quickly that Aaron wasn\u2019t really one for hanging out at home, so each day we\u2019d go to a couple of activities. Structured around 5am wake ups, three meals, two snacks and two naps a day. The days would go pretty quickly and I could feel the bond between us grow as he lost his nut with enjoyment. I\u2019d fallen in love for the first time since I met my wife 12 years ago, and I wanted to spend as much time with him as possible. It\u2019s not all fun, and a lot of the job is repetitive and monotonous. My two mantras for making it work are that you can\u2019t be lazy and you can\u2019t be selfish. There\u2019s really not much downtime, in between the meal planning, cooking and feeding. Life during the day is giving this baby what he needs. I caught myself looking at Aaron is his car seat once arriving home. Stuck in his seat, tired, hungry and needing a change. He looked, in all honesty, a bit pathetic. He really, really, needed me and that wasn\u2019t always welcome. I did also find myself missing the mental stimulation that work provides a fair amount of the time. Caring for a baby from 5am with a hangover is also, and I mean this, genuinely horrific. At first, I did feel a bit of a novelty as a stay-at-home dad. Matt on holiday with wife Ashton and son Aaron (Picture: Matt Arnold) It wasn\u2019t rare for me to be the only male over the age of one in a room of 20. However, as soon as I realised we were all there for exactly the same reason, I never felt uncomfortable or in the wrong place. It dawned on me pretty quickly I had to park any sense of unease at singing and dancing in classes, even though it was definitely there. Everyone gets more out of these things if you just throw yourself into them, and so it came to be. There\u2019s no reason why women should be expected to take any more joy from that week\u2019s tenth rendition of wheels on the bus than men, really. It helps to make friends, and I was warmly welcomed into groups of nannies that hung out a lot together. I have definitely experienced some backward-looking attitudes though. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they tend to come from the generation when child-rearing was seen as \u2018women\u2019s\u2019 work. I had to patiently explain to a family member that the chance that work would \u2018discover I was dispensable\u2019 during my time off was the exact feeling faced by women forever. I\u2019ve been asked how \u2018being mummy\u2019 was going. There\u2019s a long way to go for it to be seen as normal. But, hopefully, as the take up increases, society will catch up and my experience won\u2019t be treated as unconventional anymore.\n\n3. Morgan, Cardiff \u2013 3 months following wife\u2019s 9 months, overlapping 8 weeks to travel USA together with baby Milo\n\nMorgan used part of his SPL to overlap with his wife\u2019s so they could travel to and across America as a family (Picture: Morgan Specht)\n\nI was one of the first men to apply for SPL from my department. Initially my request was not approved. Fortunately, the law on SPL protects fathers and, ultimately, my leave was approved.\n\nIt was my wife, Becky, who told me about SPL when it was first introduced. So, as soon as she was pregnant, we knew that we wanted to use it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter our now one-year-old son, Milo, was born we split up our leave entitlement of 12 months \u2013 Becky took nine months consecutive parental leave, leaving three months for me.\n\nEight weeks of that I took during Becky\u2019s leave so we could take Milo, then six months old, to visit the USA to see my family and for an adventure in the American Southwest.\n\nThe seven weeks we spent there was the most unique part of our SPL. We began with 12 days at Milo\u2019s grandparents near Washington, DC. During this time, we also visited family and friends in Philadelphia, New Jersey and Maryland. It was so lovely seeing Milo spend time with people who are important to us.\n\nThen the three of us went on our own adventure.\n\nBecky feeding Aaron on day two of solids in the Grand Canyon (Picture: Morgan Specht)\n\nWe flew to Phoenix, AZ and rented an RV for a 12-day road trip finishing in San Francisco. We saw the deserts and Canyons of the Southwest, visited LA and drove up the California coast.\n\nWe took Milo down into the Grand Canyon and to the top of a Mountain in Joshua Tree National Park in our baby carrier. It was surreal changing his nappy and introducing him to solid food in the bottom of the Canyon.\n\nThe RV was also great for baby travelling, because we could maintain a healthy home-cooked diet for Milo and we had plenty of space to hang and dry Milo\u2019s cloth nappies.\n\nAfter a few days with friends in the Bay Area we took the Coast Starlight sleeper train from San Francisco to Portland to visit my cousins.\n\nThe sleeper train was hands down the best way to travel with a baby \u2013 no need for a car seat, we could roam the train enjoying the views and Milo slept with Becky on her bunk. After a few days in Portland, we took another train to Seattle to stay with my sister and her family for our final two weeks before flying home.\n\nMorgan, Becky, and Milo spent eight weeks travelling America and seeing the sights (Picture: Morgan Specht)\n\nI used my remaining five weeks leave at the end of Milo\u2019s first year, so I could have some Milo-Daddy time and help with the transition when Becky returned to work. It was a great help for her knowing Milo was with me rather than having to put him straight into nursery.\n\nI was one of the first men to apply for SPL from my department. The online application system was set up for maternity leave and therefore didn\u2019t work for me at first.\n\nI identified a period of leave that would minimise the impact on the business, but my line manager had some reservations about me taking SPL and initially my request was not approved.\n\nFortunately, the law on SPL protects fathers and, ultimately, my leave was approved. I know several fathers though who would have loved to take SPL but never applied because they thought it would count against them at work.\n\nThere are worse place to change nappies than the Grand Canyon (Picture: Morgan Specht)\n\nHaving Milo is the best thing that ever happened to me. And SPL has really helped.\n\nIt has allowed us to bond and for me to be an equal caregiver \u2013 despite not being able to breastfeed! I\u2019ve been able to share the load and the pleasures of raising Milo. It has helped my relationship with Becky by giving us each the chance to be the main breadwinner and the main parent.\n\nMy friends and family, who are parents in America, where annual leave and maternity leave is limited, are envious that I can take time away from work with my son.\n\nWhen I was struggling with my conscience, thinking I would be missed at work, several dads told me that my son would only be a baby for a short time, don\u2019t miss it.\n\nI haven\u2019t missed it \u2013 and I would recommend it to everyone.\n\nHOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF SHARED PARENTAL LEAVE Many men know that they are allowed to take shared parental leave \u2013 but how many know that the leave can be overlapped? It is possible to take leave back-to-back with a partner, but it is also possible to overlap leave, allowing for weeks or months spent getting used to being a little family unit. Here\u2019s what the government\u2019s shared parental leave advice says: You and your partner may be able to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) if you\u2019re having a baby or adopting a child. You can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay between you. You need to share the pay and leave in the first year after your child is born or placed with your family. You can use SPL to take leave in blocks separated by periods of work, or take it all in one go. You can also choose to be off work together or to stagger the leave and pay. To get SPL and ShPP, you and your partner need to: meet the eligibility criteria \u2013 there\u2019s different criteria for birth parents and adoptive parents\n\ngive notice to your employers\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In 2015, Shared Parental Leave (SPL) was introduced.
