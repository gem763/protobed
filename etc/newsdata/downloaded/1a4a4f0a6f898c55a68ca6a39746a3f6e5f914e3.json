In total, 387 737 Max flown by 60 airlines are grounded.\n\nBoeing\u2019s stock has dropped 11% since the 737 Max was grounded in March, costing the company $27bn in market capitalization. Before the crashes, the plane accounted for nearly 70% of Boeing\u2019s overall commercial aircraft deliveries, and 30% of its total operating profit.", "description": "FAA told EU counterpart not satisfied with safety demonstrations for systems reconfigured after aircraft suffered two fatal crashes", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/southwest_737.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb07f5036314398474fadea4500c1d84", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
