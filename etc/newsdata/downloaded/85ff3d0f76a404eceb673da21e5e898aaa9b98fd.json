What they clearly did get, however, was a spectacle that cemented Lewandowski\u2019s brand as an unapologetic fighter for Donald Trump\u2014for better or for worse.\n\nTuesday\u2019s high-profile hearing was essentially a coming-out party for Lewandowski\u2019s long-teased, but still unannounced campaign for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire: he talked up his \u201cblue collar\u201d roots and service to President Trump while effusively praising his former boss and gleefully trolling his Democratic questioners. During a bathroom break, he tweeted out a link to a web site supporting his possible Senate run; at another point, while answering a question from a friendly lawmaker fantasized about what he\u2019d do if he were in the \u201cupper chamber.\u201d\n\nThat performance didn\u2019t come as a shock to Democrats on Capitol Hill or back in New Hampshire, who said they expected that Lewandowski would seize on the hearing to boost his own profile.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and aides did not admit to any second thoughts about Lewandowski\u2019s appearance in light of his explicit politicking and eagerness to gum up the hearing. And they predicted his testimony would damage whatever political hopes he does harbor.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) noted that in his testimony, Lewandowski admitted that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report found that Trump summoned him to the Oval Office in 2017 and directed him to send a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that the president wanted Mueller reined in . Lewandowski had previously said he couldn\u2019t recall talking about Sessions with Trump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s obstruction of justice, plain and simple,\u201d said Cicilline. \u201cAdmitting that in this hearing, under oath, I think is not a way to begin a U.S. Senate campaign.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire Democrats, meanwhile, have been salivating for weeks at the prospect of Lewandowski creating a televised spectacle, believing it to be a golden opportunity to define him to voters ahead of a possible bid. Party officials and activists in the state have been widely speculating that the former Trump campaign official would use his face time in front of the Judiciary Committee to leave little doubt in Granite Staters\u2019 minds that he is preparing to launch a Republican challenge to Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nNew Hampshire Democratic Party spokesman Josh Marcus-Blank pointed to Lewandowski\u2019s promotion on Tuesday of the website paid for by a new outside group backing him, called Stand With Corey. \u201c By ducking questions and promoting that dark money group during a Congressional hearing to which he was subpoenaed to testify, Lewandowski is demonstrating once again that he works for those shady clients and Trump, not the people of New Hampshire,\u201d said Marcus-Blank.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly in keeping with his character,\u201d one member of the New Hampshire Democratic state committee said on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s been following him in New Hampshire knows he\u2019s all about empty, shameless performances.\u201d\n\nLewandowski\u2019s stunts in New Hampshire have historically been well telegraphed. In 2010, he debated a cardboard cutout of former Gov. John Lynch on national tax day at the height of the Tea Party movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all performance,\u201d the New Hampshire Democratic state committee member added.\n\nThe 46-year-old Windham resident had been on a media tour in his home state in recent weeks, saying he\u2019s \u201ctaking a very long look\u201d at a possible candidacy. After steering the early part of Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign\u2014before being ousted by the president in a dramatic fashion\u2014the bombastic operative has since worked as a Washington consultant and television commentator, engaging in politics from the outside.\n\nThe Daily Beast previously reported that Lewandowski recently huddled with Trump after several administration officials encouraged him to enter the race. While some Republicans in the state explicitly said his entrance would help Shaheen\u2019s chances\u2014a sentiment that was bolstered by an editorial in the conservative newspaper the Union Leader advocating for a write-in over Lewandowski\u2014his allies are convinced he\u2019s entering as the frontrunner.\n\nOver the course of over five hours on Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Lewandowski took every opportunity he could get to talk up his biography and his work in helping to elect Trump in 2016. In fact, he seemed to revel in injecting explicit politics into his testimony. \u201cI appreciate your comments about my ability to win in New Hampshire,\u201d he said, in response to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who mentioned Lewandowski\u2019s political ambitions.\n\nIt was just one more thing to enrage Democrats during an already-infuriating afternoon during which Lewandowski refused to answer questions and generally stymied Democrats\u2019 limited time questioning him. \u201cThis is not a Republican primary campaign,\u201d admonished Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) to Lewandowski. \u201cThis is the House Judiciary Committee.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on the panel seemed eager to serve softballs to Lewandowski that allowed him to expound on his patriotism, values, and character. \"Do you think the Democrats will go to any length to undermine the president of the United States and influence the 2020 election?\" asked Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ).\n\n\"I believe in this democracy of the United States and I love this country,\" responded Lewandowski, adding that his primary concern is that his children and grandchildren look back at the Mueller inquiry and say, \"that never should have been allowed, never to a Republican and never to a Democrat.\"\n\nDespite the muddled questioning and political maneuvering, Democrats said it was worth bringing in Lewandowski.\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d said one Democratic aide, \u201cIt\u2019s not like he has a shot at winning.\u201d", "description": "During his five hour testimony on Tuesday, Lewandowski talked about his biography, his patriotism and, most importantly, his loyalty to President Trump.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Hanna Trudo", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568766923/190917-brodey-hanna-Lewandowski-tease_nhy7dj", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
