Length: 44 feet Weight: 7.5 tons Height: 9ft 2in Speed: The car will attempt to beat the 763mph land speed record next year. It is hoped it could one day reach 1,000mph Engine: Rolls-Royce EJ200 engine used in Eurofighter Typhoon jets Wheels: 95kg aluminium wheels rotating at 10,200rpm at full speed Temperature in the rocket: 5,432F (3000C)\n\nIf he succeeds, designers hope to push the car towards an unprecedented 1,000mph in the future.\n\nThe car, first presented in London in 2015, was partially dismantled in order to be taken to South Africa last week.\n\nIt was flown to Johannesburg and then transported another 570 miles to the desert where tests will take place.\n\nNow fully assembled and unveiled today, it will spend four to five weeks on the high-speed tests.\n\nThe EJ200 jet engine was partly developed by Rolls-Royce and the car will produce 135,000 thrust horsepower, equivalent to more than 150 Formula One cars.\n\n'The high-speed tests will see the Bloodhound LSR car blasting along the Hakskeenpan desert racetrack for the very first time,' Bloodhound organisers said.\n\nRecord holder Green said: 'After years of work to prepare the car, and following almost a decade of preparation of our desert track by the Northern Cape government, we\u2019re delighted to finally be here.\n\nDesert testing: The car will travel at speeds of up to 500mph as it prepares to take on the 763mph record set by former fighter pilot Andy Green in 1997\n\nThe jet-powered vehicle (pictured today) was flown to Johannesburg and then transported another 570 miles to the desert where tests will take place\n\nHistory of the world land speed record 1904: Frenchman Louis Rigolly becomes the first man to drive a car at 100mph, taking the record from American carmaker Henry Ford 1927: Briton Henry Segrave passes the 200mph mark, driving the Sunbeam 1000 HP Mystery in Florida 1963: American Craig Breedlove sets the first record with a jet-powered car, reaching 407mph, although it was not ratified as the official record until later 1964: Breedlove reaches 500mph, driving at Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in the United States 1983: Britain reclaims the record when Richard Noble drives Thrust2 at 634mph 1997: Andy Green breaks the record twice in the same year in Nevada's Black Rock Desert, reaching the current benchmark of 763mph in October that year while driving ThrustSSC 2020: Bloodhound manufacturers hope to beat the record\n\n'The next few weeks will allow us to test the car and train the team, ready for our assault on the outright world land speed record next year.'\n\nA 10-mile desert racetrack has been set up in what organisers say is the 'largest area of land ever cleared by hand for a motorsport event'.\n\nFunded by South African authorities, local people have have moved some 16,500 tonnes of rock from 237million square feet of dry lakebed.\n\nBloodhound staff can lay out as many as 25 individual tracks side by side, as the car will break up the surface when it travels at extreme speeds.\n\nTest runs described as 'low-speed' tests - which nonetheless reached 200mph - were previously carried out in Cornwall in 2017.\n\n'Many other aspects of the car will be different, such as the wheels, which will be solid aluminium wheels specially designed for the desert surface,' manufacturers explained.\n\nThe project suffered a setback last year when the company behind it went into administration.\n\nBut it was saved from the scrapheap when British entrepreneur Ian Warhurst bought the business in December 2018.\n\n'The wheels have been designed specifically for this desert lake bed, but it will still be vital to test them at high speeds before making record speed runs,' he explained earlier this year.", "description": "The\u00a0British-built Bloodhound car, powered by the engine of a Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, was displayed in the Hakskeenpan desert where it will undergo high-speed tests.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19995732-0-image-a-14_1571669802789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
