So hopefully they learn from it.\"\n\nThe former Gogglebox star also told how her mum Betty often crafts a response to nasty messages but she will never send them to perpetrators.\n\nEarlier this year, Scarlett said she was left house-bound as a result of online trolling.\n\nThe TV star recoiled in horror when she was called \"fat\" and mocked by viewers for revealing a hint of her bra in a plunging dress on Love Island's After Sun.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut Scarlett has pledged to champion body confidence in the face of trolls.\n\nShe said: \"I used to avoid this photo it would upset me because even thinking about this moment where I got trolled for the way I looked reminded me of the state of depression it sent me in to the point where I didn\u2019t even want to leave the house!\n\n\"But I don\u2019t think that looking at this photo now! Now I see a young girl living her best life appearing on a show she loves, showing off her best assets and her curves.\"\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\n\"Throw your middle finger up to anyone who tells you your too thin, too fat, your stretch marks are ugly, your body isn\u2019t the right shape, your boobs are too small, too big, your bums too flat or too fat or you\u2019re too fake!\n\n\"Don\u2019t listen to them. LOVE YOURSELF BECAUSE LIFE IS TOO SHORT,\" she continued.\n\nScarlett slimmed down to a size 8 in 2016 after she lost three stone over a six-month period.\n\nHowever, she later put some of the weight back on and admitted she didn't have time for the gym and said she was \"just a normal lass\" when people commented on her size.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
