To be sure, some of us get more stressed out in volatile markets than others. But the fact that retirement is still many years in the future means that market volatility is mostly a nuisance, a headache, a stressor at that life stage. Your portfolio has time to recover, and market weakness, even really bad troughs like 2009, isn\u2019t likely to make or break your plan.\n\nThat all changes in the years leading up to retirement, though, as well when you\u2019re retired. If you haven\u2019t taken steps to protect your portfolio and your plan ahead of serious market gyrations, the short-term nuisance of volatility can turn into actual risk in a hurry. Volatility is the fact that markets go up and down as the years go by; it\u2019s something that you just have to put up with unless you\u2019re willing to settle for the meager yields that guaranteed investments offer. (And I wouldn\u2019t recommend that, as inflation could gobble up most of your return and then some.) Volatility becomes risk if those gyrations coincide with a time when you need to spend your money and you haven\u2019t taken steps to defend against that possibility.", "description": "If you're within 10 years of retirement, this eight-step review can help you improve your situation--and your peace of mind.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt8870afe34c82af68/5c76b9ca763b502362e52b21/ChristineBenz_1x1.jpg"}
