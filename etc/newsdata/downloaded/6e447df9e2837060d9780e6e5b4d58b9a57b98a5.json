It is really tough in the current market with the uncertainty, particularly policy uncertainty, to make that investment, and the only person who can get rid of the sovereign issue is the sovereign,'' he said.\n\n''So there is a role for governments to provide that security after that five-year period, like Rod Sims said, and that is what we are doing through schemes like [the] Underwriting New Generation [policy].\n\n''We have a real need to increase the amount of baseload dispatchable power in the system, and so coal should be part of that mix.''\n\nMr Canavan has increasingly linked the debate over coal-fired power to the future of Australia's ailing aluminium industry, which has smelters at risk of closure in Queensland, Victoria and NSW.\n\n''If you don't support coal-fired power you are kissing goodbye to a big chunk of our aluminium industry,\" he said.\n\nAlcoa is in discussion with the Victorian government over whether hundreds of millions of dollars worth of subsidies can be extended when they expire in 2021.\n\nThe smelter is located in a safe Coalition seat held by Education Minister Dan Tehan, but Mr Canavan declined to say whether he believed the subsidies should be extended.\n\nBut Mr Canavan said subsidies for Portland were required because Victorian energy prices were made higher by state government policies that banned extraction of onshore gas and the exit of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station.", "description": "The resources minister stopped short of backing an industry push for carbon capture and storage to earn tradeable carbon credits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_59/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3d6ce865f52ecaa1f834070463666a056e014fd5", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
