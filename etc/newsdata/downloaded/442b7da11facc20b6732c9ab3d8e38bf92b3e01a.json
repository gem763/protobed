So that would crush them,\" said the former employee on condition of anonymity, explaining that changing a product's chips could halt production and give rivals a chance to take market share.\n\nAmbarella did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours.\n\nRepresentatives of Hanwha Techwin did not respond to requests for comment and previously declined to discuss how Hikvision's circumstances were affecting its U.S. business.\n\nLast year it said the bulk of its products were made domestically and in Vietnam, and that none of its products for North American markets came from China.\n\n\n\n\n\nLAYOFFS\n\nHonovich said other likely beneficiaries of the blacklisting were Motorola Solutions Inc unit Avigilon and Sweden's Axis, owned by Japan's Canon Inc.\n\nNeither Avigilon nor Axis responded to requests for comment.\n\nMotorola Solutions in its second-quarter earnings call with analysts in August said it saw upside from the earlier federal contracting ban, part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\n\"The sales cycle in Fed is even longer than state and local,\" said Gregory Brown, Motorola Solutions' chief executive officer, according to a transcript of the call. \"I think we will become a beneficiary of the NDAA procurement ban for Hikvision and Dahua in the video security space, but I think that will be more likely 2020.\"\n\nThe former Hikvision employee said the Chinese firm laid off dozens of staff in the United States because of slumping sales in the country, with several going to Hanwha Techwin.\n\nHikvision did not comment on the layoffs or confirm the use of Ambarella chips.\n\nHikvision, which has a market value of about $42 billion, receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7.02 billion) in revenue from overseas, Reuters reported in August.
