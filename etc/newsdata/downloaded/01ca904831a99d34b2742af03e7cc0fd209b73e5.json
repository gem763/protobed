Aitchison and Cook were told that they would have to pay for new tickets, and not only for themselves but also for their wedding party of 14 family and friends.\n\nDesperate for help, the couple reached out to Caesars Palace, which then reached out to Delta Airlines, and the two companies joined forces to make the couple's dream wedding come true.\n\nMarka/Universal Images Group/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"Going above and beyond is one of our values, and the way the teams pulled together to help Andrew and Sharon is a prime example of this,\" said Shane Spyak, staff vice president of sales and JV integration, Europe, Middle East, Africa and India, according to Delta.\n\nThe couple and their guests left Liverpool on Sunday for Las Vegas.\n\n\"5 days ago travel & wedding plans in tatters. In 12 hrs ... heading to Heathrow for our @Delta flight on our way to @CaesarsPalace #likeacaesar . Down to the kindness of amazing people at Delta and Caesars. \u2026 What surprises await us?\" Aitchison tweeted on Sept. 28.\n\nThe wedding plans have officially commenced and the lovely couple, @AndyAitcho and his fianc\u00e9e Sharon, have arrived to a royal welcome.

I can\u2019t believe what has happened in the last week and this has just topped it off. Thank you Rod you\u2019ve absolutely made our dream wedding you absolute legend. We Can\u2019t wait to see you Friday #LikeACaesar #SirRod,\" Aitchison tweeted Wednesday after the ceremony.\n\nAfter Aitchison and Cook said their vows, Stewart appeared, giving the shocked couple a hug.\n\n\"I can\u2019t imagine how you must have felt and the disappointment of not being able to travel,\" he told them. And, then he serenaded them with \"Have I Told You Lately.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s do this ... and I wish you all the luck in the world. Come and stand next to me,\" he said.\n\n\"Have I told you lately that I love you\u2026. Have I told you there\u2019s no one else above you,\" he began to sing. \"Fill my heart with gladness ... take away my sadness ... Ease my troubles that\u2019s what you do.\"\n\nThe party cheered.\n\nStewart also later invited the wedding party and the newlyweds to his show at the Colosseum, \u201cRod Stewart: The Hits,\u201d according to Caesars Palace.\n\nAitchison told Delta that the experience had been a roller coaster.\n\n\"On Monday, we lost everything for our dream wedding in Vegas.
