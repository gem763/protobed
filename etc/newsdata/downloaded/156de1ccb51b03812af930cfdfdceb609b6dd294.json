Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) appears to be the only 2020 Democrat with some sense, at least on the impeachment front. She has repeatedly said she didn't believe in moving forward with impeaching President Donald Trump because she thought the issue was divisive. She reiterated that point on Tuesday during an interview on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n\"Where do you stand, right now, on terms of impeachment?\" host Brian Kilmeade asked.\n\n\"I have been consistent in saying that I believe that impeachment in this juncture would be terribly divisive for our country at a time when we are already extremely divided,\" Gabbard explained. \"Hyper-partisanship is one of the things that's driving our country apart.\"\n\nAccording to Gabbard, the American people, not politicians, should decide if President Trump stays in office.\n\n\"I think it's important to defeat Donald Trump. That's why I'm running for president, but I think it's the American people who need to make their voices heard, making that decision,\" she said.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about Gabbard, you have to give her credit on this front. America is extremely divided today and politicians in Washington play into that. The impeachment saga is a prime example of their role in this division.\n\nWhether or not Trump should be impeached is taking up Congress' time. They're focused on ousting Trump instead of working on legislation that would benefit the American people. And the truth of the matter is, average, everyday Americans are tired of the hyper-partisanship. They want both sides to come together to solve problems that impact us. Gabbard actually seems to be one of the few people who understands that.", "description": "She's breaking from the pack..09/25/2019 0:31:41AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/9f1d352a-a24c-4438-b8c2-3ca0d5a52790.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
