The Khmer empire was a powerful state in South East Asia, formed by people of the same name, lasting from 802 CE to 1431 CE. At its peak, the empire covered much of what today is Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, and southern Vietnam. By the 7th century CE, Khmer people inhabited territories along the Mekong river - the world's seventh longest river - from the delta to roughly the modern Cambodia-Laos border, plus the region between that river and the great Tonle Sap lake to the west. There were several kingdoms at constant war against each other, with art and culture heavily influenced by India due to long established sea trade routes with that subcontinent. Hinduism mostly, but Buddhism as well, were important religions in the region, mixed with animist and traditional cults. Important cities from that time include Angkor Borei, Sambor Prei Kuk, Banteay Prei Nokor and Wat Phu.\n\nDamian Evans, part of the five-strong research team, told the New Scientist the result was 'a very full and detailed interpretation of that city'.\n\nThe new findings build on scans that were made in 2012 that confirmed the existence of Mahendraparvata, an ancient temple city near Angkor Wat.\n\nEvans and his colleagues first found traces of extensive networks surrounding the monumental stone temple complex at Angkor Wat in June 2016.\n\nHe said at the time that their findings could further our understanding of Khmer culture and throw into question traditional assumptions about the 15th-century decline of the empire.\n\nFor years, experts have assumed that the ancient Khmer civilization collapsed in the 15th century when invading Thai armies sacked Angkor Wat, forcing populations to relocate to southern Cambodia.\n\nAngkor Wat, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is considered one of the ancient wonders of the world.", "description": "Mahendraparvata - an eighth to ninth century capital of the empire - was believed to have existed in the Southeast Asian state in the Angkor period, but scientists had struggled to pin point its location.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19880334-0-image-a-10_1571395807956.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
