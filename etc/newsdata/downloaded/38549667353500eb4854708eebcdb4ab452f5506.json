He has transferred $10.1 million from old accounts to his 2020 campaign, but, unlike Ms. Warren, he had eschewed high-dollar fund-raisers in past races. (Other senators transferred money into their 2020 bids as well.)\n\nThere is no way to say exactly how much of the $10.4 million Ms. Warren transferred from 2018 was attributable to large donations. Her campaign said she had 380,000 donors to her re-election who gave an average of $30 \u2014 a strong grass-roots following. Records show about $6 million of her Senate funds also came from donors who gave $1,000 or more.", "description": "Ms. Warren wooed wealthy donors for years, stockpiling money from fund-raisers, and has used $10.4 million from her 2018 Senate race to underwrite her 2020 bid.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/us/politics/09warren-money/09warren-money-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
