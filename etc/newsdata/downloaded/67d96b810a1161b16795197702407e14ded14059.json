It\u2019s incredible. 900 million pounds is a hell of a lot of money to have no centre forwards.\u201d\n\nNO CONFIDENCE\n\nEngland striker Rashford himself looked shorn of confidence before pulling up with his injury and remains without a goal from open play for United since the opening day of the season.\n\nOther than Rashford, only Daniel James and the injured Martial have scored this term, with the team mustering just six goals from open play in the league to date \u2014 two fewer than Manchester City scored against Watford on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have had historically loads of centre-backs out with injuries. At the moment it is strikers. It happens in football,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cYou are going to get highs and lows. There is a good atmosphere in the dressing and we have got the focus right.\n\n\u201cHopefully Mason and Anthony will be back for Arsenal.\n\nThe fact Solskjaer is depending on a 17-year-old with two senior starts for the club highlights the lack of depth in the United squad.\n\nThe Norwegian has to be worried by United\u2019s alarming dip in form since the initial positivity following his appointment to succeed Jose Mourinho last December.\n\nUnited have lost seven of their last 15 league games \u2014 as many defeats as they had recorded in their previous 40 matches in the competition.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIt remains to be seen where the goals to turn United\u2019s season around will come from. Lukaku divided opinion at Old Trafford, and never really hit top form after signing from Everton in 2017.\n\nBut taking out the Belgian\u2019s his goal contribution, without bringing another proven goalscorer in, could be a decision Solskjaer lives to regret.\n\n($1 = 0.8014 pounds)", "description": "Manchester United's decision to sell Romelu Lukaku, who was their top scoring forward in the previous two seasons, without a replacement coming in looks to be one they could regret after a toothless display in a 2-0 loss at West Ham United on Sunday.", "authors": ["Peter Hall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432678051&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0NG", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
