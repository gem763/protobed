Tourists stood in the middle of the street nonchalantly taking photos. Restaurants spilling out onto small squares \u2013 and not a car, moped or bus in sight.\n\nSuch are my memories of Venice, the only car-free city I have ever been to, when a friend and I visited during a student hitch-hiking summer holiday. The Italian city is, of course, unique in that it is built on a series of small islands \u2013 yet it is a refreshing experience being able to wander around without dodging in and out of traffic.\n\nFor the last 100 years, the car has come to dominate the urban landscape. Streets have been widened in many cities to accommodate automobiles, and huge amounts of space are given over to parking them. Private vehicles have revolutionised mobility, but they have also introduced many ills, from air pollution to traffic accidents. And today a small but growing number of cities are trying to design the car out of the urban landscape altogether.\n\nBoth Oslo in Norway and the Spanish capital Madrid have made headlines in recent years for their plans to ban cars from their centres \u2013 although neither have entirely got rid of them yet.", "description": "Many modern cities have been built around cars, with huge amounts of space set aside for roads and parking.
