They need players with the courage to produce special moments on the biggest stages and Marcus Rashford certainly delivered on that front during this absorbing battle, settling a tight game when he blasted home an astonishing free-kick with 17 minutes.\n\nChelsea v Manchester United: Carabao Cup fourth round \u2013 live! Read more\n\nRashford had already scored from the spot and the striker had more belief than any of his teammates when Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s players were on the ropes. The momentum had been with Chelsea but Frank Lampard\u2019s side would be stunned in the end. Their seven-game winning run was over and United, unbeaten in four games, were through to the last eight of the Carabao Cup.\n\nThere was a callow feel to a young Chelsea side, a lack of oomph waiting to be exploited, and United were quick to assert themselves in the physical battles. Scott McTominay set the tone when he steamed into Mateo Kovacic early on, a tackle for which he was rightly booked, and Lampard must have been alarmed when he saw Harry Maguire win the ball off Marcos Alonso with a strong tackle, shrug Christian Pulisic aside and stride unimpeded out of defence.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAdmittedly the England defender followed that manoeuvre by booting the ball out for a throw but United had disrupted Chelsea\u2019s rhythm and were carrying the greater threat in attack. There were hints of menace when Jesse Lingard charged into the area, forcing Marc Guehi to make a last-ditch challenge, and McTominay had gone close in the 13th minute, sweeping a shot just wide after meeting a low corner from Daniel James. The visitors were the more fluent side and it summed up Chelsea\u2019s unease when Alonso, who was frequently outnumbered on the left, gave away the penalty that allowed United to edge ahead midway through the first half.\n\nElmohamady gives Aston Villa edge over Wolves in makeshift cup derby Read more\n\nA fine run from the impressive James, who was always available to receive the ball on the right, created the danger. The winger\u2019s pace carried him deep into Chelsea\u2019s territory and he was entitled to go down after being bumped from behind by Alonso, who was foolish to stick a knee into the Welshman\u2019s back. Chelsea\u2019s left-back could have no complaints when Paul Tierney pointed to the spot, though at least United\u2019s recent struggles from the spot gave him hope of a reprieve.\n\nYet Rashford, who had seen a penalty saved against Norwich last Sunday, was merciless this time. The striker had also missed one against Crystal Palace in August but there was no doubt in his mind here, only the composure to send Willy Caballero the wrong way and slot a low shot into the opposite corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Willy Caballero launches himself full length towards the top corner but cannot stop Marcus Rashford\u2019s dipping free-kick.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka was keeping Pulisic quiet on the opposite flank and Chelsea needed better hold-up play from Michy Batshuayi, who fed off scraps for much of the opening period.\n\nCurtis Jones and Liverpool beat Arsenal on penalties after 5-5 thriller Read more\n\nKept at arm\u2019s length by United\u2019s 3-4-2-1 system, Chelsea had not even mustered a shot on target during the first half. Yet there were brighter signs at the start of the second and the equaliser should have arrived in the 50th minute. Caught out by Alonso\u2019s cross from the left, United were relieved when Hudson-Odoi, who had required treatment after toppling over the advertising hoardings moments earlier, scuffed wide from close range.\n\nChelsea had raised the tempo and it took an excellent saving challenge from Williams to stop a perceptive pass from Billy Gilmour, a beautiful little mover in midfield, reaching Hudson-Odoi. The ball squirted back to Gilmour and the 18-year-old\u2019s shot was blocked by Marcos Rojo, with Tierney waving away the crowd\u2019s appeals for handball.\n\nThe chances kept on coming. Reece James drove forward from right-back and whipped in dangerous crosses. Hudson-Odoi had also woken up, running in behind whenever he saw space in front of him, and the 18-year-old winger should have done better after latching on to a ball over the top from Pulisic, only to send a bouncing effort inches over Sergio Romero\u2019s bar.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nA goal was on the way, though, and it arrived when Caballero punted a clearance towards Batshuayi in the 61st minute. The Belgian striker had spent most of the evening being bullied by Maguire but this time he made the United centre-back look clumsy and slow, nodding the ball away from him, turning sharply and charging towards the area. Maguire\u2019s lack of pace had been exposed and Batshuayi, who scored Chelsea\u2019s winner against Ajax last week, underlined his growing confidence by smashing a low shot beyond Romero from 25 yards.\n\nOn came Anthony Martial and Andreas Pereira, enabling Solskj\u00e6r to switch to a back four, and there was elation when Rashford delivered the game\u2019s decisive moment. The striker\u2019s free-kick wobbled in the air and took the breath away as it flew past Caballero. Chelsea were stunned.", "description": "Marcus Rashford scored an astonishing free-kick winner to give Manchester United a 2-1 Carabao Cup victory at Chelsea", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691947f5c3690401b07f46967faa417009660131/0_130_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b1c8cda7a2faef83b7a027c97b3afe8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
