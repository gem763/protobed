If Parliament cannot agree a way forward, then it is time for a new Parliament \u2013 and the only means of doing this is via a General Election.\u2019\n\nThe Prime Minister, making his plea ahead of a Commons vote tomorrow on whether to hold a December 12 poll, declared that the current Parliament had \u2018run its course\u2019 and should be dissolved\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s remarks came as a new opinion poll gave the Conservative Party a 16-point lead over Labour \u2013 its largest advantage over Jeremy Corbyn since May 2017.\n\nThe Opinium survey for The Observer put the Tories on 40 per cent, Labour on 24 and the Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent.\n\nMr Johnson is expected to lose tomorrow\u2019s Election vote since opposition MPs are saying they will block such a move until No Deal is ruled out \u2013 but No 10 says it will put down similar motions until it wins the day.\n\nMr Corbyn has infuriated his MPs by vacillating about whether to comply with Mr Johnson\u2019s Election pleas. Many worry that a Tory party spurred on by voter frustration over Brexit would lead to a heavy defeat for Labour in a December poll\n\nTo add to the pressure, the Conservatives are this weekend launching a social media campaign with the aim of encouraging voters to email their MPs to push for a chance to go to the polls.\n\nMr Johnson is expected to lose tomorrow\u2019s Election vote since opposition MPs are saying they will block such a move until No Deal is ruled out \u2013 but No 10 says it will put down similar motions until it wins the day\n\nMeanwhile, and in an attempt to \u2018call the bluff\u2019 of Election-blocking MPs, No 10 strategists said they were considering announcing that No Deal was \u2018off the table\u2019 on the grounds that Mr Johnson has in fact secured a deal with Brussels.\n\nIn another development, DUP leader Arlene Foster warned the Prime Minister that her MPs will continue to reject his deal unless he secures further concessions from Brussels.\n\nAddressing her party conference in Belfast yesterday, Ms Foster said that the DUP had put Mr Johnson on the \u2018naughty step\u2019 by voting against his Government twice in the last week because the measures in the new deal for regulatory and customs borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would take Northern Ireland in the \u2018wrong direction\u2019.\n\nFor his part, Mr Corbyn has infuriated his MPs by vacillating about whether to comply with Mr Johnson\u2019s Election pleas.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s remarks came as a new opinion poll gave the Conservative Party a 16-point lead over Labour \u2013 its largest advantage over Jeremy Corbyn since May 2017. The Opinium survey for The Observer put the Tories on 40 per cent, Labour on 24 and the Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent\n\nMany worry that a Tory party spurred on by voter frustration over Brexit would lead to a heavy defeat for Labour in a December poll. And as The Mail on Sunday reports today, a group of Mr Corbyn\u2019s MPs is mobilising to try to topple him.\n\nYesterday, he claimed that Labour would be very happy to fight a General Election once \u2018all vestiges\u2019 of a No Deal Brexit had been taken off the table.\n\nHe also called on Mr Johnson to stop using \u2018ridiculous language\u2019 after he urged Mr Corbyn to \u2018man up\u2019 and back a December 12 poll.\n\nOfficials at Tory HQ say they are ready to go to the polls, with many campaign managers already in place across the country and associated literature going out this week.\n\nStressing that Labour \u2018must agree to an Election on December 12,\u2019 Mr Johnson added: \u2018If they refuse this timetable \u2013 if they refuse to go the extra mile to complete Brexit, I will have no choice but to conclude that they are not really sincere in their desire to get Brexit done.\n\n\u2018If they do not accept this offer, I will continue to campaign for an Election and show the people in this country the stark choice before them: a Conservative Government that will get Brexit done, deliver on their priorities and unite the country, or a Labour Party that will snarl us in further toxic debate and more delay.\n\n\u2018Parliament cannot hold the country hostage any longer. Millions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures.\n\n\u2018This paralysis is causing real damage.\u2019", "description": "The Prime Minister, making his plea ahead of a Commons vote on whether to hold a December 12 poll, declared that the current Parliament had 'run its course' and should be dissolved.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20227196-0-image-a-65_1572126093543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
