The majority arrived with at least one other family member.\n\nMany of those arriving are fleeing violence or poverty and travel north through Mexico until they reach the US border. Upon arrival, they must pass a \"credible fear\" interview to seek asylum in the US, which most do.\n\nThe rule change means they would fail had they not claimed asylum in another country they had first passed through.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Africans risking death in the jungle trying to reach the US\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the ruling, argued it drastically limited those eligible for asylum.\n\n\"The current ban would eliminate virtually all asylum at the southern border, even at ports of entry, for everyone except Mexicans,\" it said in a petition.\n\nA lawyer for the group described the ruling as a \"temporary step\" and said it remained confident at challenging the change.\n\n\"The lives of thousands of families are at stake,\" Lee Gelerent said.\n\nAnyone who has been rejected by a third country or is a victim of human trafficking can still apply.\n\nA US justice department spokesperson said the decision would help \"to bring order to the crisis at the southern border, close loopholes in our immigration system and discourage frivolous claims\".\n\nTrump's 'big win'\n\nAnalysis by David Willis, LA correspondent, BBC News\n\nFacing a surge in asylum claims by Central American and other migrants who have been crossing the southern US border in record numbers, the Trump administration has been desperate to clamp down.\n\nIn July the President announced new rules restricting asylum applications from migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\n\nThat move was immediately challenged in the lower courts, and it may come back to the Supreme Court once ongoing legal challenges have been completed.\n\nBut for now the president has something to celebrate - on Twitter he hailed the decision as a Big Win.\n\nWhy is this controversial?\n\nThe rule change overturns long-standing convention that the US hears asylum claims no matter how people have arrived at the border.\n\nOn the nine-judge Supreme Court, liberal-leaning Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the ruling.\n\n\"Once again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,\" Justice Sotomayor wrote.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Migrants at the border last month in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico\n\nThe route to the US is dangerous, with Central American migrants often deliberately sought out by gangs in neighbouring countries because they are vulnerable.\n\nThere are questions over whether Mexico and Guatemala can cope with a surge in asylum claimants.\n\nMexican officials, who have been working to crack down on migration, have already pushed back strongly against the plan.\n\nEarlier this week, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard reiterated that Mexico would not become a \"third country\" for US-bound asylum seekers.\n\nThe Mexican president, Andres Manuel Labrador, earlier on Wednesday posted an image of himself on the phone to President Trump.\n\nThey are yet to publicly comment on the Supreme Court's latest ruling - which is the second in favour of Mr Trump's migration plans so far this year.\n\nIn July the nation's top court ruled Mr Trump can use $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) of Pentagon funds for his long-promised southern border wall.", "description": "The rules allow the US to reject asylum claimants who have not applied en route to the US border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EAB5/production/_108758006_mediaitem108758005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
