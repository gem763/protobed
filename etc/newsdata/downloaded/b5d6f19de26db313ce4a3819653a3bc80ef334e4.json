That meant investors in the company could not adjust their buying or selling behavior or their risk assessments.\n\nVolkswagen rejects the accusations.\n\n\u201cThe company has meticulously investigated this matter with the help of internal and external legal experts for almost four years,\u201d said Hiltrud Dorothea Werner, VW's board member for legal affairs, in an emailed statement. \u201cThe result is clear: the allegations are groundless.\u201d\n\n\u201cVolkswagen therefore remains confident that it has fulfilled all its reporting obligations under capital markets law. If there is a trial, we are confident that the allegations will prove to be unfounded,\u201d said Werner.\n\nWhen Volkswagen executives knew of the emissions cheating has been one of the key questions hanging over the Dieselgate scandal since it broke in 2015. VW has so far been forced to pay out more than $25 billion in compensation in the U.S.\n\nDiess\u2019 lawyers said he will continue as CEO while the case proceeds, according to Reuters.\n\nEarlier this year, the former CEO of VW unit Audi, Rupert Stadler, was charged by a Munich court over his role in the scandal.", "description": "Prosecutors in Braunschweig say CEOs failed to promptly inform investors of financial implications.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174181935-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
