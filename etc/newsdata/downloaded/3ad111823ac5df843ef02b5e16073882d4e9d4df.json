(Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\n\nThe U.S. men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s loss to France on Wednesday in the World Cup quarterfinals didn\u2019t elicit any rending of garments, even though the loss was the Americans\u2019 first at an international tournament featuring NBA players since 2006. The reasons for the collective shrug were many: Team USA already had qualified for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, the team\u2019s composition didn\u2019t exactly rise to Dream Team level, the rest of the world has long since closed the gap, the game was played on a Wednesday morning in China, etc. It was as if the U.S. basketball-watching public checked the score, noted the peculiarity of the result and went about its day.\n\n[USA basketball has been this low before. The last time, it responded by dominating.]\n\nIn Australia, the seasons are on the other side of the calendar from ours and the basketball players react to World Cup losses like this:\n\nAndrew Bogut after Australia\u2019s double OT loss to Spain:\n\n\n\n\u201cGoogle where headquarters of f***ing FIBA is. It's f***ing disgrace.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Via @jmiklovas)\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/s6qzgJOdJq \u2014 Ballislife.com (@Ballislife) September 13, 2019\n\nThat would be Australian big man Andrew Bogut after the Boomers\u2019 double-overtime loss to Spain on Friday in the World Cup semifinals, a game in which several calls seemed to go in the Spaniards\u2019 favor. One of them, a loose-ball foul on Bogut while he was attempting to pull down a defensive rebound, took place with less than 10 seconds remaining and the Aussies up by one, and the big man responded with a hand gesture that indicated his thoughts about whether the referees were on the level:\n\nMarc Gasol would hit the two free throws that followed to give Spain a one-point lead, but Australia\u2019s Patty Mills sent the game into overtime by making 1 of 2 foul shots on the ensuing possession. After two extra periods, Spain pulled away for a 95-88 win.\n\nThe two sides have something of a history. At the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Sergio Rodriguez hit a pair of free throws with 5.4 seconds left to give Spain an 89-88 victory and the bronze medal, sending the Australians to their fourth fourth-place finish at the Olympic tournament. The call that sent Rodriguez to the line also was considered dicey, as replay showed that Mills had backed out of his way and avoided contact.\n\n\u201cThey got some tough calls towards the end,\u201d Bogut said after that game, in which he battled foul trouble. \u201cPatty\u2019s call towards the end comes three seconds after the ball hits the rim, so [the officials] are obviously thinking about something.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it has to go that way, and disappointing that the play before, Aron Baynes gets an arm-bar foul in a one-point game with 20 seconds left. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. They controlled the tempo of the game, and it wasn\u2019t in our favor.\u201d\n\nFormer NBA big man Luc Longley, then and now an assistant coach for Australia, on Friday took an anatomically foul-mouthed bent when trying to describe the Boomers\u2019 lousy luck with the referees during games against Spain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s f----- very similar. I think, in Rio, I also think we deserved to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a f------ ... I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve gotta do. We\u2019ve gotta find an altar somewhere and burn a sacrifice, or do something the basketball gods, because they\u2019re not kissing us on the [male body part] yet, like they do Spain. You can print that if you want.\n\n\u201cSpain gets kissed on the [male body part] by the basketball gods every time we play them.\u201d\n\nNo, the male body part he mentioned was not the Adam\u2019s apple.\n\nAs for how Australia can recover ahead of Sunday\u2019s third-place game against France?\n\n\u201cThe trick is not compounding this into another loss in two days,\u201d Longley said. \u201cThe trick is cauterizing the wound somehow, without alcohol. That\u2019s usually how I cauterize my wounds. But that\u2019s not the way to do it at the moment.\"\n\nLongley let it all hang out.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got anything beautiful for you, guys. I\u2019m a little bit stunned. I feel f------ stabbed in the heart by that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nWhy everyone is talking about Kobe Bryant, youth basketball coach and former ... dancer?\n\nTeam USA eliminated from World Cup medal contention with 89-79 loss to France\n\nAn ode to the NBA\u2019s \u2018ninja-style\u2019 headbands: Gone but not forgotten\n\nThe Wizards could learn a thing or two from the Mystics, the best team in the WNBA\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox", "description": "Parental guidance is suggested after the Boomers' NSFW remarks.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Am", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
