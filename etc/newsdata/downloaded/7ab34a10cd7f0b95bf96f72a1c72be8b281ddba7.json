But they reflect a significant shift in the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, where duties were twice as high as in Mexico, China and the European Union last year.\n\nThe new opening is a central feature in Economy Minister Paulo Guedes \u2019s plans to make the country of 210 million more competitive, part of an effort to rekindle a moribund economy historically shielded from foreign competition and bogged down by bureaucracy. Since 2014, the country has been mired by recession and low growth, with the jobless rate hovering at 12% or more.\n\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s model of protectionism has failed,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister for Trade Marcos Troyjo, one of Brazil\u2019s chief trade negotiators, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been 40 years without sustainable economic growth.\u201d\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro\u2018s administration is opening up one of the world\u2019s most closed big economies.

It would create a $21 trillion trade bloc of 780 million people, the biggest in the world. But Brazil is also pursuing trade deals with South Korea, Canada, the U.S. and other countries.\n\n\u201cThis administration is pushing for trade openings harder than its predecessors,\u201d said Filipe Carvalho, a Washington-based analyst who tracks Brazil for the Eurasia Group, a political-risk consulting firm. \u201cAn increase in commerce can have a significant impact on the economy and also give Brazil a bigger role in global affairs, both key goals of the administration.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think this trade strategy will yield for Brazil in the short and long term? Join the conversation below.\n\nBrazil has created a system where tariffs were sky high and the state inserted itself to jump start industries or protect them. Car makers are shielded with 35% tariffs on imported autos. Deep in the Amazon, hundreds of factories in the Manaus Free Economic Zone enjoy tax cuts\u2014and tariffs leveled on foreign competitors\u2014as they churn out electronics, motorcycles and other products sold to Brazilians at hefty prices.\n\nBrazilian importers pay tariffs on everything from drugs to clothing, dairy products and more. The country is among the few in the digital age to charge foreign vessels a lighthouse-maintenance fee, a duty created two centuries ago, even though ships now use global positioning systems to navigate. The duty is set to die under the European agreement.\n\nThe problems created by protectionism are evident throughout Brazil\u2019s economy.\n\nWhen Mau\u00e1 University outside S\u00e3o Paulo imported American equipment last year that it couldn\u2019t find in Brazil to upgrade its physics lab, for example, import tariffs doubled the price tag to $70,000, said Francisco Olivieri, a business professor and head of Mau\u00e1\u2019s technology department.\n\nEconomy Minister Paulo Guedes wants to make Brazil more competitive in an effort to boost a moribund economy.

Importers are subject to steep fines if they fail to request a permit, but it is often difficult to determine from which agencies they must seek approval.\n\nSo many years of protective policies have made some Brazilian businesses too fragile to compete in a free market, some analysts and executives say.\n\n\u201cWe have always had a protectionist model,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Ebert, chief operating officer at Xalingo SA, a 600-employee toy maker in Brazil\u2019s southern tip that would face challenges if Brazil keeps opening up to trade.\n\nHe said competing with imports would be hard if conditions in Brazil for businesses, from the quality of infrastructure to red tape, don\u2019t improve before trade deals open the floodgates for cheaper, and often better, rivals. Make those improvements, Mr. Ebert said, and his company\u2019s productivity would increase.\n\n\u201cWe need to be more productive and efficient to deal with the new competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street.\u201d\n\nRelated video At the U.N General Assembly, Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro plans to address concerns about deforestation, the Amazon fires and economic development in his country.

In neighboring Argentina, also considered tough on companies, it takes 311.5 hours a year.\n\nWorn-out roads and a lack of railways make freight prices in the huge nation twice as expensive as in the U.S., according to Pro-Logistic Movement, a Brazilian farming trade group. Brazilian businesses have long said that a trade opening should come only after bureaucracy and taxes were cut and roads, ports and railways expanded and improved.\n\nCarlos Abijaodi, director of industrial development at CNI, the industry confederation, said that businesses now want both trade and reforms to take place at the same time. CNI, which supports trade deals, sees the two changes as central to improving Brazil\u2019s business climate.\n\n\u201cOpening the economy brings great responsibilities upon the government,\u201d Mr. Abijaodi said. \u201cThe government will have to remove costs stemming from bureaucracy, from our tax system, our logistics and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nWrite to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nFrancisco Olivieri is a business professor and head of the technology department at Mau\u00e1 University in Brazil.
