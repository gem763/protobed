In 2016, three Australian tourists had to be retrieved after falling into a crevice.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Uluru's waterfalls Show all 17 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Let\u2019s come together; let\u2019s close it together.\u201d\n\nSince the impending ban was announced, more people than ever have flocked to the Red Centre to make the climb before it\u2019s too late, totalling nearly 10,000 extra visitors a month on average in the last six months.\n\nIn July 2019, 57,000 people came to the park, an increase of 42,000 year-on-year, reports the ABC.\n\nMany of these are clearly choosing to ignore the sign at Uluru\u2019s base, which reads: \u201cWe, the traditional Anangu owners, have this to say. Uluru is sacred in our culture, a place of great knowledge. Under our traditional law, climbing is not permitted. This is our home. Please don\u2019t climb.\u201d\n\nMany Twitter users expressed disappointment that tourists would still choose to sneak in a climb before the ban, knowing Uluru\u2019s significance to the Anangu people.\n\n\u201cI do not understand this at all,\u201d tweeted Lorraine Williams. \u201cWhen we visited Uluru before moving to Australia it never crossed our minds to climb \u2013 the best view is the rock itself \u2013 and we respected and still respect the traditional owners and their request not to climb. So disappointing to see this.\u201d\n\nTerry Australis added: \u201cImagine being specifically, repeatedly, and very politely asked not to do something \u2013 with very good safety, environmental and cultural reasons being outlined at length \u2013 and still acting like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am absolutely disgusted at this. Absolutely no respect for the traditional owners\u2019 wishes,\u201d added another Twitter user.", "description": "Tourists have been filmed queuing in their hundreds for a chance to ascend Uluru before a climbing ban\u00a0comes into effect.
