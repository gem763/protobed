(Sept. 12) AP\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Girl power proved electric in Hollywood on Monday night.\n\nAnd in a series of fiery speeches, A-list stars took candid turns at the podium at the annual Elle Women in Hollywood Celebration, each describing progress they've seen on the ground.\n\nNicole Kidman, letting the rare F-bomb fly (a humorous nod to her presenter and \"Bombshell\" co-star Charlize Theron's expletive-laden introduction with Margot Robbie), segued into a proud story about her 11-year-old daughter, Sunday Rose.\n\n\"The other day I was in the car driving her back from school and I asked the question you always ask \u2013 'What do you want to be someday when you grow up?'\" recalled Kidman.\n\nAfter pondering becoming an astronaut, Sunday said her \"real\" career would be in movies. But not as an actress. \"I want to be a director,\" she told her mother confidently. \"And I'm pretty sure I can make that happen.\"\n\nNicole Kidman posed on the black carpet at the Elle Women in Hollywood Celebration on Oct. 14.

For that little girl to be able to say, 'Yeah, I can be a director' \u2013 I would never have said that. I said I could be an actress, but I never said a director.\"\n\nHonoree Natalie Portman followed by saying she yearns for the day women can fail and keep going. \"We tell our kids that making mistakes is the only way to learn. And we know that the biggest moments of our growth come out of our worst blunders.\" But \"if you are a woman and you are a pain in the (butt), you will not get another job,\" she said.\n\n\"How will we know if we've reached equality?\" Portman asked. When mistakes are forgivable or \"when the post-mistake learning is real, people of all genders get the second chance that men currently do.\"\n\n\u201cGo out post-mistake and succeed, wildly,\" she challenged the largely female audience. \"(Mess) up and thrive, sisters!\" Portman declared, subbing in an F-bomb.\n\nWhen it was her turn to be honored, Mindy Kaling questioned a different double standard. \"Why is it the sole responsibility of people of color to hire people of color?\" wondered the \"Late Night\" star/writer, adding that white directors who are not held to the same standard \"are free to churn out movie after lily-white movie until the end of time simply because Ava DuVernay exists. She gets tired, guys!\"\n\nThen Gwyneth Paltrow took the stage, admitting she wished she'd prepared a speech. \"Cause I'm drunk and I'm just the lame old white lady,\" she cracked. The \"Politician\" star then said creating her lifestyle website Goop, \"where we can help women eliminate shame, it's been the most rewarding thing of my life, really.\"\n\n\"Queen & Slim\" director Melina Matsoukas closed the night by dedicating her speech to Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman fatally shot by police in her Fort Worth, Texas, home during a welfare check who had been playing video games with her young nephew. \"She was killed in her own bedroom which is meant to be a safe haven for a person. ...Today we stand her to honor her life,\" she said.\n\nAlso honored at the event were Scarlett Johansson, Lena Waithe and Zendaya.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/15/nicole-kidman-daughter-natalie-portman-gwyneth-paltrow-elle-celebration/3983214002/", "description": "At the annual Elle celebration Monday night, Nicole Kidman, Natalie Portman and Gwyneth Paltrow got real about progress in Hollywood.", "authors": ["Andrea Mandell", "Published A.M.
