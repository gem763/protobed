The match officials took no action after reviewing the incident, but the wing was summoned to appear before a disciplinary panel this week and found guilty.\n\nWales working hard to stay within laws at Rugby World Cup, says Justin Tipuric Read more\n\nCheika was speaking at Australia\u2019s base in Tokyo Bay having announced his side to face Wales here on Sunday. It contains four changes from line-up against Fiji, all in the back division, and the match-day squad contains 1,287 caps, more than 50 a man, one of the highest in the tournament\u2019s history.\n\nCheika was angry not only at the ban but criticism of the Wallabies in the panel\u2019s judgement after Hodge had said in his evidence that he had no knowledge of World Rugby\u2019s decision-making framework for high tackles and had not been trained on it. \u201cThis was of some general concern,\u201d the judgement said.\n\nCheika volunteered to speak about the issue at the start of his team media conference. \u201cThere has been some chat about the players not being told about the framework: the judge put it in there. I want to make a couple of points. The framework is for referees, not the players, and used to decide whether there are red or yellow cards in a game. In my view, the officials in this tournament are using that framework very well.\n\n\u201cSecond, our players are coached to tackle around the middle where they can dislodge the ball. We do not need the framework to tell them how to tackle. I am not sure where that is coming from and I do not know why it was put in the judgement.\n\n\u201cReece was nervous while giving his evidence. There are people starving out there but they flew a QC over. When people are asking you questions and you have done nothing wrong you are nervous and may not have answers to all the questions on the top of your tongue. We thought we would just mention it. People are making a point about us so we thought we would make one back \u2013 a bit of tennis.\n\n\u201cI do not know why they did it. I do not particularly want to talk about this today because there is a part of it which is us versus everyone else. We know that and we are not going to let it derail us. We will suck it up and get focused on what is important \u2013 the match on Sunday. We are not going to let them get to us. We will concentrate on our footy and do our best for Australia.\u201d\n\nAustralia have until Saturday lunchtime to appeal, although as Hodge irregularly had his ban halved for mitigating circumstances despite pleading not guilty he would face being given an extra three matches if unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cIt will be up to Reece predominantly,\u201d said Cheika. \u201cWe will see what he reckons and go from there. We have talked about it with the players. No one believes that what Reece did met the red card threshold because of the framework they have in place.\u201d\n\nHodge will be replaced by Adam Ashley-Cooper \u2013 who will win his 120th cap \u2013 for the match against Wales, which is likely to decide who emerges top from Pool D. Bernard Foley returns to the halves alongside Will Genia and Dane Haylett-Petty will wear the No 15 jersey. There is no place for Kurtley Beale or Nic White in the starting XV; both players shift to the bench. Five-eighth Christian Lealiifano, who struggled against Fiji in Australia\u2019s opening Rugby World Cup match, has been dropped entirely.\n\nThe drastic backline overhaul was not down to form, Cheika said. \u201cJust a different picture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought about this from the very start. We had a plan of different pictures we wanted to produce. It\u2019s a really tight go across the board in our team in a lot of positions. We know Wales are a very strong team. We know we\u2019ll have to be on for 80 [minutes] to have success against this team.\u201d\n\nWales, meanwhile, have named an unchanged team after Monday\u2019s impressive opening against Georgia. Their Lions\u2019 No 8 Ross Moriarty remains on the bench and captain Alun Wyn Jones will set a new national record of 130 caps.\n\n\u201cWe had a good debate about the loose forwards and whether we started Ross, but we felt we played pretty well in the first half against Georgia and that it would not have been fair to drop anyone,\u201d said head coach Warren Gatland. \u201cWe are not looking far ahead beyond this game. We are just trying to build some momentum and it will be tough whoever you meet if you reach the quarter-finals. The intensity in training has gone up a notch this week and it will be another great game against Australia.\u201d\n\nAustralia: 15-Dane Haylett-Petty, 14-Adam Ashley-Cooper, 13-James O\u2019Connor, 12-Samu Kerevi, 11-Marika Koroibete, 10-Bernard Foley, 9-Will Genia, 8-Isi Naisarani, 7-Michael Hooper (captain), 6-David Pocock, 5-Rory Arnold, 4-Izack Rodda, 3-Allan Alaalatoa, 2-Tolu Latu, 1-Scott Sio.
