Thus, effectively \u201ccasting a really wide net out there to catch people that may not even be conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re a-political, maybe they\u2019re leftists, but everyone, no matter what side of aisle you\u2019re on, you\u2019re consuming pop culture,\u201d said Clark, adding that her added perspective may inspire non-political people to think differently.\n\n\u201cConservatives are finally demanding that we get a seat at the table when it comes to culture \u2014 because we\u2019re seeing a complete shift right now in pop culture,\u201d added the TPUSA contributor.\n\nClark also mentioned Kanye West\u2019s latest album, Jesus Is King \u2014 as well as some recent interviews featuring the rapper \u2014 which have been dominating the national conversation surrounding political culture.\n\n\u201cSaying that black people don\u2019t have to vote Democrat, talking about Christianity,\u201d noted Clark, \u201cwhen people like Dave Chappelle \u2014 who are not conservative by the way \u2014 but you know what Dave Chappelle is doing is actually just pushing back against politically correct comedy, and so what I think the future is, is that we\u2019re going to start seeing in the entertainment world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to see some people coming out as conservatives, but we\u2019re also going to see people that are just not leftists,\u201d she added.\n\nClark said that her new \u201cPOPlitics\u201d show \u2014 which will be \u201cpop culture without the propaganda\u201d \u2014 is available every weekday at 4:00 p.m. EST on Instagram, as well as TPUSA\u2019s official YouTube channel.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Turning Point USA contributor Alex Clark told Breitbart News about her new original show, POPlitics, which will cover \"all things\u00a0pop culture and lifestyle from a uniquely conservative perspective.\" Clark spoke to SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow in a Wednesday interview for the show\u2019s weekly TPUSA campus report.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/TPUSA-Alex-Clark-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
