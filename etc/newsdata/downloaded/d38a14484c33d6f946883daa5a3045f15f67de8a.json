'There was a no shoes rule, and walked into a room of people whose pain radiated off of them, like some terrible superpower.\n\n'I was such an open nerve that on my first day of group therapy when I was asked to share a little bit about why I was there, I told my seemingly endless tale of, whoa, you know, the one that justified and necessitated being numbed by medication.\n\n'The patients and the therapist simply looked at me and said, \"shit.\" \u2019\n\nAn honor; The writer-actress was given the Women Of The Year award by Demi Moore, 56, at the event, hosted by actress and singer Katey Sagal, 65, who has been sober for three decades\n\nCuddling up: Demi, looking beautiful in a blue jumpsuit, has also battled with addiction\n\nLena added: 'I love Friendly House because they are trans and non-binary inclusive, because they don\u2019t turn women away because of income bracket, because they bring women together who are from really different paths of life and allow them to connect through the miracle of recovery.'\n\nShe insisted she began to heal 'because I allowed myself to be loved by a group of people in recovery who showed me that I was worth saving and worth loving no matter what metaphorical and, like, sometimes literal alleys I had wandered down.'\n\nDespite that Lena said she felt 'shame' when she eventually left rehab but she's learned that her recovery 'doesn\u2019t cancel out' who she was.\n\n'I realized being me has hurt and sometimes it\u2019s hurt so much that I couldn\u2019t bear it. But being me is also a super power. And it\u2019s the same for all of you.'\n\nAt the podium: The Girls creator and star recalled the moment when her parents dropped her off at the threshold of the treatment center 'like it was camp'", "description": "The 33-year-old writer-actress spoke about her addiction at the the Friendly House treatment center's 30th Awards Luncheon at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills on Saturday.", "authors": ["Bobbie Whiteman For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20303936-0-image-a-13_1572305135720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
