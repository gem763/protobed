Elena Delle Donne wasn\u2019t close to 100% healthy, the team lacked scoring depth and, ultimately, no one in the league could match the Storm\u2019s talent.\n\nBut this year, the Mystics have been the WNBA\u2019s standard-bearer for by and large the entire season. Delle Donne powered her way to an MVP award, and after a year away from the WNBA Emma Meesseman returned to the fold to give the Mystics the X-factor they lacked.\n\nNow, the No. 1 Mystics will take on the No. 2 Connecticut Sun in the Finals, starting with Game 1 Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Entertainment and Sports Arena.\n\nThe Mystics beat the fourth-seeded Las Vegas Aces 94-90 Tuesday to win their semifinal series in four games. Delle Donne scored 25 points, while Meesseman netted 22 on 9 of 14 shooting and 4 of 4 from the 3-point arc. Offensively they played well in space, and defensively they held one of the Aces\u2019 best players, A\u2019ja Wilson, to four points.\n\nMeesseman was a starter for much of the series and posted 27- and 30-point games in Games 1 and 2. But with guard Kristi Toliver finally healthy enough to move from bench contributor to starter for Game 4, Meesseman switched back to a supporting role off the bench and still managed to have a strong game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the box score, I\u2019m looking at four players in double figures, the things we did, Emma Meesseman accepting her role of changing the lineup today to go back to our lineup that we started the season with,\u201d coach Mike Thibault said. \u201cI thought we would get more punch-off out of our bench today, match-ups would work a little better. Not only did she accept her role but she excelled at it.\u201d\n\nConnecticut beat the Mystics two out of three times during the regular season, but in their most recent matchup on June 29, the Mystics rang up a 102-59 win, one of the most lopsided results in league history.\n\nThe analytics say the Mystics have the best offense the WNBA has seen. Both their offensive rating of 115.9 and their 1.128 points per possession set league records. A few players have been cold during the postseason so far, but besides Delle Donne and Meesseman, Natasha Cloud, Aerial Powers and at times LaToya Sanders have made tough shots or assists in clutch moments.\n\nConnecticut will counter with Jonquel Jones, their 6-foot-6 center and leading scorer and rebounder. The Mystics don\u2019t have anyone quite that size to guard her, but Jones won\u2019t pose as unique a problem inside as, say, the Aces\u2019 Liz Cambage, who averaged 23.8 points per game in the semifinals.\n\nCloud said the Sun are \u201ca team full of people that, at any moment, they can put up 30\u201d points. But she was not short of confidence that the Mystics were ready to achieve the goal they\u2019ve chased for years, saying the core of the roster has learned from the adversity it\u2019s faced in the last few seasons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown together, but the biggest thing has been our relationships off the court have translated on the court,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cYou see how much fun we have and how much we enjoy when others thrive and do well. This is what separates us. We\u2019re really a family. Our relationships off the court have made our relationships on the court much better.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
