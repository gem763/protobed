His erratic actions, followed by revelations of his alleged behavior, have cost him tens of millions of dollars and cast a light on his off-the-field conduct.\n\nThe text messages that surfaced this week ended his brief tenure with the Patriots in a matter of hours. A person familiar with the matter said the texts provided tangible evidence of inappropriate behavior while he was a member of the team. Coach Bill Belichick has control over the team\u2019s personnel but this person said he consults with owner Robert Kraft when off-the-field issues arise, including this case.\n\nWhen the Patriots signed him, they were taking a risk on a player who has been the best at his craft in recent years but who veered into unpredictable behavior over the past few months. Then, just as he signed with the Patriots, the situation took a deeply troubling turn.\n\nBritney Taylor, a former college classmate and trainer of Brown, filed a civil lawsuit accusing him of inappropriate sexual conduct in three instances with her\u2014including a 2018 occasion when he physically overpowered her with \u201cgreat violence\u201d and raped her despite her cries for him to stop. In two other incidents, she says, he exposed himself and forcibly kissed her and in another ejaculated on her back without her consent. Brown, through his lawyer, denied the allegations.\n\nThe team had no knowledge of the allegation until after he signed, the person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe NFL and the team found out about the lawsuit as it became public, and the league quickly launched an investigation. But the league, and the team, had few immediate disciplinary options. Because the allegations against him stemmed from civil lawsuit, and were not reported to police, there was limited evidence to act upon until an internal investigation could be conducted.\n\nThe Patriots kept Brown in the immediate wake of the lawsuit, and he played in his first game with the team last Sunday. It would be his last.\n\nThis week, Sports Illustrated reported that Brown allegedly acted inappropriately toward another unnamed woman, an artist who had been contracted to paint a mural for him. The woman\u2019s lawyers allege Brown came onto her while he was naked, and their relationship ended abruptly after that. Brown denies that he engaged in such activities, his lawyer Darren Heitner said.\n\nAfter that story\u2019s publication, the woman\u2019s lawyers say, Brown sent her \u201cthreatening\u201d text messages. The messages were sent to her on a chain that included others, who were asked by Brown to investigate the woman\u2019s background. Brown also accused her of making up lies for money.\n\nOne of the members of the text chain was a convicted drug dealer, according to a letter her lawyers sent the league. Some included on the thread--including Heitner, his attorney\u2014did not send any messages to the woman or respond to Brown\u2019s texts on the chain, a person familiar with the text conversation said.\n\nThose alleged threats were reported to the league on Thursday. In brief remarks Friday morning, Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Brown was still on the team. Hours later, they released him.\n\n\u201cWe feel that it is best to move in a different direction at this time,\u201d a team spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe NFL had already begun investigating Brown before he was released. NFL investigators met with Taylor for 10 hours on Monday, another person familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn the other case, the league has communicated with the woman\u2019s lawyer, who argued in a letter to the league that Brown\u2019s behavior violates the league\u2019s personal-conduct policy. \u201cThe NFL advised us that the Patriots directed Mr. Brown to have no further contact with our client, either directly or through his associates,\u201d the woman\u2019s lawyers, Lisa J. Banks and Debra S. Katz said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe NFL and the Patriots clearly took our client\u2019s concerns seriously,\u201d Banks and Katz said after Brown\u2019s release. \u201cThe NFL has assured us that regardless of Antonio Brown\u2019s roster status, it will continue to investigate all claims regarding his behavior.\u201d\n\nSince Brown entered the NFL, he has been one of the league\u2019s best players. Until this season, he had played exclusively with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with whom he blossomed from a sixth-round draft pick into one of the game\u2019s most formidable assets. From 2013 to 2018, he led the NFL in receiving yards.\n\nBut he grew discontent in Pittsburgh, sat out the last game of the 2018 season and forced a trade. That landed him with the Raiders, a franchise notorious for taking on mercurial yet talented players. They gave him a rich new deal, with nearly $30 million guaranteed if he fulfilled his contract. But he squandered that before ever playing in a game with them.\n\nOver the course of weeks, he showed up to training camp with injured feet from a cryotherapy mishap, beefed with the league over wanting to use a helmet that did not meet safety guidelines and got into a fight with Oakland\u2019s general manager after he was fined for missing practice. Then he posted a video of a conversation with the team\u2019s coach, Jon Gruden, and demanded his release.\n\nThat wish was granted, and just as the season began he signed with New England. His tenure with the team captured why he drew so much attention: in one game, he displayed his uncanny abilities and caught a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. But because of his alleged off-the-field behavior, that game would be his only one with the Patriots.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "description": "The New England Patriots released star wide receiver Antonio Brown after less than two weeks with the team, after multiple women accused the receiver of sexual misconduct, including one allegation of rape.", "authors": ["Andrew Beaton", "Andrew.Beaton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109287/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
