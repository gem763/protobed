United, has scored once in the regular season and in each of the three friendlies against international opponents. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nPlayers from Mexican club Puebla had had enough. It was an exhibition against D.C. United before a small, midweek crowd at Buzzard Point, and when the referee looked away, they swatted at their irritant, forward Quincy Amarikwa. There were slaps and an alleged punch.\n\nIf video review had been available in the Sept. 4 friendly, Amarikwa said, \u201cthree of them would have gotten sent off. I can\u2019t speak Spanish, but I got in their heads so bad. That\u2019s funny.\"\n\nSome players gain advantages with speed or strength. Others have superior technical ability. Then there is Amarikwa, a well-traveled forward in his first season in Washington who uses Jedi mind tricks and psychological warfare to unnerve opponents.\n\nDuring stoppages, he will stare at a foe with widened eyes and a broad smile, his index fingers pointed at his temples. It\u2019s not hard to read his lips: \u201cI\u2019m in your head.\"\n\nDuring a recent interview, that phrase was plastered on his black T-shirt, in small letters below \u201cMSL,\u201d short for Mental Strength League, which has become his brand and philosophy.\n\nLast month, he applied his cerebral tactics on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Los Angeles Galaxy\u2019s 6-foot-5 superstar. Despite giving eight inches, Amarikwa marked him on corner kicks and harassed the ever-dangerous Swede, who did not score during United\u2019s 2-1 home victory.\n\nNo room at all for Zlatan. pic.twitter.com/pDnx5T2Rhl \u2014 ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) August 12, 2019\n\n\u201cI got all inside Ibra\u2019s mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are developing land there now and building a couple of skyscrapers and put a building in the middle that says, \u2018I am in your head.\u2019 The rent is free. Anyone and everyone, come join us.\u201d\n\nOther Galaxy players were targeted as well, prompting shoves and Amarikwa rubbing his eyes to imply they were crybabies.\n\nQuincy just went up a few notches in my book \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d. Vamos #DCU pic.twitter.com/ArkuZWiNyF \u2014 Dave Topp (@Topper18) August 12, 2019\n\nHis Twitter page features an edited photo of him and Ibrahimovic, plus emoji of fingers pointed at a head.\n\nAmarikwa, 31, attributes his longevity \u2014 six teams, including San Jose twice, and four in-season trades \u2014 to doing blue-collar tasks, such as keeping the ball while others join the attack and drawing fouls in dangerous spots. It\u2019s the kind of stuff, he lamented, that is not quantified (and, by extension, not monetized) in soccer.\n\nYes, he also scores once in a while: This year, he has pocketed one goal in league play (a terrific volley to forge a draw against New England) and one in each of the three international friendlies, including the 1-1 draw with Puebla. Amarikwa has appeared in 19 of 30 MLS matches and started twice.\n\nHis reputation as a hard-working, athletic forward \u201cis my fail-safe,\u201d Amarikwa said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to beat me when the best part [of my game] is my psychological advantage over you.\u201d\n\n[Russell Canouse will take the playing time with United where he can get it]\n\nHis language, Amarikwa said, never crosses the line. \u201cI am not saying anything that would question my integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are definitely calling me a lot of not family-friendly words. You just agree with them and say: \u2018Yes, I am that. Hell, yeah, I am that, too.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe fact opponents are taking the time to confront him, Amarikwa said, proves his tactics are effective.\n\nAsked whether referees warn him about his chatty ways, Amarikwa said: \u201cThe referees are probably annoyed with [the opposition] complaining every three seconds, crying about me talking. How soft are you?\u201d\n\nIn a whiny, high-pitched voice, Amarikwa mimics what he says he hears opponents say.\n\n\u201cRef, he is talking to me! Tell him to leave me alone. I am a professional athlete. Ref, he asked me a question. Tell him to stop it!\u201d\n\nTeammate Paul Arriola has overheard Amarikwa\u2019s exchanges.\n\n\u201cHe is a funny guy,\u201d Arriola said. \u201cHe does a lot of repeating what they are saying. They are looking at him like they have no clue what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m looking at Quincy like, \u2018You are a fool.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUnited acquired Amarikwa as a free agent just before the season opener to provide front-line depth behind top scorer Wayne Rooney. (Late this summer, he dropped on the depth chart when Ola Kamara signed.) Representing himself, Amarikwa signed a one-year guaranteed contract for the senior minimum salary ($70,250).\n\nThe organization knew it was getting a savvy player who wears down opponents physically but also brings unique intangibles.\n\n\u201cMost players I have coached, you can put in bucket A, bucket B, C, D, right?\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said. \u201cHe is in a different bucket. I like people that are different and have different ideas. He is a very intriguing guy.\u201d\n\nAmarikwa has delved into the business world, preparing for life after his playing career. His pursuits include online marketing and asset management.\n\nHe does a lot of talking not only on the field, but off it. He engages teammates in deep conversation, seeking to understand how they think and why they make certain decisions.\n\nNot everyone appreciates all of it. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d one team member said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAt first, Olsen was not sure Amarikwa would fit into the group, and two months into the season, the club thought about releasing him, multiple people close to the team said.\n\n\u201cHe comes with a lot of ideas,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cHe pushes guys to think outside the box, and more times than not, that\u2019s healthy. He has found his groove with the group; I don\u2019t think that was always the case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t completely understand him, but I am trying to make an effort to understand him more.\u201d\n\nAfter a recent training session, Amarikwa and Olsen conversed on the field out of earshot of staff and reporters for some 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the minimum with Quincy,\u201d Olsen said, laughing.\n\nWhile his in-house relationships have strengthened \u2014 most players seem to like him and respect him, and he is close with captain Rooney \u2014 Amarikwa sees value in his multifaceted contributions on the field.\n\n\u201cI figured out something you don\u2019t know and I am better at it than you are,\u201d he said as if speaking to opponents. \u201cThe problem is you might not like what it looks like, but the fact you don\u2019t like what it looks like means I am in your head \u2014 and I\u2019ve already won.\u201d\n\nD.C.
