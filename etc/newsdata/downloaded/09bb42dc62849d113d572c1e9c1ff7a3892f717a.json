The result: these crunchy, nutty, caramel chunks\n\nThis recipe was made by accident. Whenever a Marvel film comes around, my friends and I always find time to go to the cinema and, of course, snacks are essential. While we all get popcorn, we also have our speciality snacks: Babs has a pasta bowl, George a smoothie and Henry goes for honey-roasted nuts. I have caramel popcorn, which recently Henry went and tipped his nuts into, and it inspired today\u2019s recipe... we\u2019re talking honey caramel with a few extra tasty twists.\n\nAccidental honey-caramel popcorn\n\nLeave the popcorn to cool completely before breaking into chunks.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 20 min\n\nServes 4-6\n\n3 tbsp vegetable oil\n\n100g popcorn\n\n2 tsp fine sea salt\n\n200g salted peanuts, chopped\n\nFor the honey caramel\n\n110g honey\n\n150g caster sugar\n\n70g unsalted butter, chopped, plus extra for greasing\n\nGrease and line a 20cm x 30cm baking tin with greaseproof paper.
