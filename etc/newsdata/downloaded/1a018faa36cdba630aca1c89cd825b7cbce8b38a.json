But now it\u2019s finding its voice | Nesrine Malik", "language": "en", "text": "There is a bogeyman that haunts the Arab world. Its spectre looms large and sinister over Arab politics. Its arrival is threatened, like a curse, as a warning by parents to precocious children when they misbehave. Its name is Syria. A suppurating wound that will not heal, the Syrian civil war continues to bleed lives, and draw in neighbours and allies involved in their own proxy battles.\n\nJust as it seems one front is closed, a twist restarts hostilities \u2013 the latest involving a capricious US president and an insecure Turkish one, with the Kurds in northern Syria bearing the brunt. An abrupt American withdrawal paved the way for yet another conflagration, yet another power calculus \u2013 as Bashar al-Assad extends support to the Kurds \u2013 and yet another lease of life for Islamic State. More than 100,000 people are on the move in northern Syria. And at least 750 people with suspected links to Isis have reportedly broken out of a camp in north-east Syria, raising the possibility of a new shot in the arm for the terror group.\n\nWhen, earlier this year, the Sudanese revolution began to gather steam, the Syria bogeyman was predictably summoned. It didn\u2019t help that Sudan had received Syrian refugees. Their increasing number in Sudan \u2013 a country more accustomed to sending refugees than receiving them \u2013 was its own live warning. Is this what you want? The Syrian scenario was presented as an inevitability: this is what happens when people demand the overthrow of their leaders, when the natural order is challenged. Things certainly will fall apart.\n\nFighting continues on Syria-Turkey border as war crimes alleged Read more\n\nThe supposed Syria menace is backed by a cast of similar characters in the region. Libya, riven by factional fighting and only last month the scene of US airstrikes against militants, is also often mentioned with a shudder, a \u201cthere but for the grace of God go we\u201d if we continue challenging the status quo. Then there is Egypt, a country that, in its regression after the Arab spring, is now such a closely patrolled security state that the number of political prisoners in its jails is literally inestimable.\n\nEach day seems to bring a fresh hell across these three countries, a rebuke to all those who think that in the Arab world there is another way of politics that doesn\u2019t involve strongmen. You hear this logic internalised and vocalised by Arabs themselves in a sort of exceptionalist self-flattery. It\u2019s just our temperament, you see, we need leaders to manage our strong and stubborn character.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to be working. This is the year that the spirit of protest in the region was proven to only have been dormant, rather than extinct. The Sudanese overthrew Omar al-Bashir in a grand majestic revolution, where a revolutionary body of thousands pitted itself against the formidable machinery of the state\u2019s military dictatorship. Despite the country already suffering from ethnic and tribal divides so pronounced that an entire murderous paramilitary complex arose from its fissures, despite there being a history of bloody conflict that pointed more towards a Syria- or Libya-style disintegration, this was not enough to chill the need for change. Even after hundreds were slaughtered and the internet shut down, protesters still coordinated and found their way on to the streets of Sudanese cities.\n\nPlay Video 0:43 Trump compares Turkey and Kurds fight to 'two kids in a lot' \u2013 video\n\nNot even in Egypt has the protest movement died. If there is any indication that scorched earth suppression is inevitably a short-term solution, it is that protests are happening again. In September the first significant protests since former army chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power. In this country a tweet or a Facebook post can result in a jail sentence; and the security stakes are so high that a protester will leave home expecting not to return. Many did not. Estimates are that about 2,000 were detained.\n\nLast week it was Lebanon, where protests have erupted across several cities. There is now a similar kaleidoscope of images that plays out across Arab cities where lines have been drawn between the people and the government. Sometimes one has to squint to work out whether the throng of bodies and mobile phone screen constellations is in Beirut, Cairo or Khartoum. Both in Lebanon and in Sudan, one scene repeated itself with uncanny similarity; protesters addressing the security forces, the army and the police, rebuking them for not crossing the lines to join their comrades. In Sudan many did cross those lines, joining the revolutionaries against their own employers.\n\nThat defection, or demand for defection, lies at the heart of the resurgence of political protest. If the Arab revolutions that grew eight years ago were about removing lone dictators, the current wave is about removing an establishment that for too long has drained resources. Egypt\u2019s protests were triggered by a former government contractor who exposed Sisi\u2019s epic profligacy. In Sudan, food prices and a scarcity of basics pushed the middle class over the edge while those in power luxuriated in their spoils. In Lebanon, a tax on WhatsApp voice calls tipped those fed up with economic mismanagement over the edge. Last month it emerged that the prime minister, Saad Hariri, had gifted $16m of his own money to a South African model six years ago.\n\nDissent will not be chilled by pointing to the failures of the Arab spring. Warnings to remain quiet, pointing to the pitfalls of taking action, are increasingly going unheeded. Arabs are beginning to realise that to excessively fear what may happen in the future is to be tricked into submitting to an unacceptable present.\n\n\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Dissent is no longer dampened by pointing to the failures of the Arab spring, says Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik", "authors": ["Nesrine Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86cde60972ec27bbc9f8d7848a81ed1a00827a47/0_229_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cf842c24c740dde9d7422131efe6b15a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
