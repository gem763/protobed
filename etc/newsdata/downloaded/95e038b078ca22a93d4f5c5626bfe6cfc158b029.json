In 2018, the New York Times cancelled a public event with him following other allegations.\n\n(Sources: NY Post, TMZ, Time, Guardian)", "description": "James Franco has been accused of reportedly sexually exploiting two women from his acting school.", "authors": ["Lesego Mkhize"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9437/18b018e22b204f93b03aa42a28edb28a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
