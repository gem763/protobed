They recommend owning short-dated protection, in particular, suggesting bearish bets on the iShares iBoxx High-Yield Corporate Bond exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe Fed is widely forecast to make the third reduction in interest rates this year. Markets will be watching in particular for the central bank\u2019s future outlook -- whether it seems willing to ease policy further or wants to signal a pause. In addition to the Fed decision, a slew of economic data, including gross domestic product and the monthly jobs report, are also due by the end of this week.\n\n\u201cPuts on emerging-market equities, broad U.S. equity indexes and certain U.S. sectors (largely the most cyclical) are the most attractive to own into Wednesday\u2018s FOMC decision and a macro-heavy week, while high-yield credit ranks highest among non-equities,\u201c the analysts wrote in a note Tuesday, using a screen of options expiring Nov. 8.\n\nEmerging-market and European equities may have less downside as they are already unloved by investors, making high-yield credit, which is more heavily owned, the best way to hedge against a Fed disappointment, the strategists said.\n\nThe Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and Materials Select Sector SPDR Trust would be the best ways to hedge sectors, they said.", "description": "Here\u2019s How to Hedge If Fed Disappoints Stocks, BofA Analysts Say", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic78696ef4681d583f6c1222ae342774f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
