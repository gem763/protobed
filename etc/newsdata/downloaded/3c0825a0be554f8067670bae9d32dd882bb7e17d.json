Ron Helus as well as other officers killed in the line of duty, FOX 11 of Los Angeles reported.\n\nHelus died last Nov. 7, when a 28-year-old suspect allegedly attacked the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, killing a total of 13 people and wounding about a dozen others. The suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities have said.\n\nThousands of dollars had already been raised for fallen officers' families, but the money is now being returned to donors because Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel reportedly withdrew the police department because Trump supporters would be speaking at the event.\n\nHANNITY: DEMS WANT TO IMPEACH TRUMP BECAUSE THEY'RE 'HELL-BENT ON TAKING REVENGE' FOR 2016 DEFEAT\n\n'Wow, are you kidding me?'\n\n\"He basically said over and over in the conversation, 'This is not Trump country, that slogan 'Make America Great' is not favorable, popular, within 1,200 square miles,' that we don\u2019t want Republicans here. I could not believe it,\u201d Mike Randall, vice president of the Fallen Officers Foundation, said, according to FOX 11.\n\n\u201c'The only thing,' and I quote, 'the only thing you [could have done to make] this worse, Mike, was to invite Dick Cheney and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.'\n\n\"And I went, 'Wow, are you kidding me?\"\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans were invited to the event. Gov. Gavin Newsom's public safety liaison, Trump supporter Scott Baio, who attended Helus\u2019 church, and Trump-supporting singer Joy Villa were all scheduled to attend.\n\nHe also said Democratic Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin was upset that her former opponent had been invited.\n\nHe added that Hagel told him to get rid of the Republican speakers or the police department would withdraw. They finally did pull out.\n\n\"He goes, 'Yeah, this ain\u2019t gonna work for us,' I said, 'You\u2019re not gonna support this with the honor guard?' And he goes, 'No, we\u2019re not bringing the honor guard. We\u2019re not coming. We\u2019re not going to be there, not supporting it',\" said Randall.\n\n'This is not OK. This is prejudice.'\n\nThe Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Department issued a statement, saying:\n\n\n\n\"The 'Blue Bowl' event was represented as a charitable flag football tournament to raise funds for the family of Sergeant Ron Helus. An event that would honor Ron\u2019s memory and provide support to his wife Karen and son Jordan. As the event began to materialize, we became concerned with the behavior of some of the organizers of the event. Although I believe the organizers had good intentions, the event was moving in a direction we no longer felt comfortable supporting.\u201d\n\nSinger Villa called the chief's response \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"This is not OK. This is prejudice, hello?\" she said. \"You\u2019re shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president? This is disgusting, I\u2019m appalled, and in all my years being an out conservative, I\u2019ve never seen something so despicable like this.\u201d\n\n\"You\u2019re shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president?

Did he run in and go, 'Are you Republican or Democrat or independent, I need to know before I help you?' No they don\u2019t. ...
