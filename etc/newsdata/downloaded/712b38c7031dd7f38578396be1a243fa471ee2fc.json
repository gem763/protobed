It\u2019s kind of hard not to laugh at communities that want to lecture you on how to live your life when they can\u2019t seem to live without human feces on their sidewalks.\n\nYet the latest move by San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors is perhaps the most ridiculous thing they\u2019ve done yet.\n\nThe city of San Francisco has formally adopted a resolution calling the National Rifle Association a domestic terrorist organization. San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took the step of officially declaring the nation\u2019s premier gun-ownership advocates a terrorist organization. District 2 Supervisor Catherine Stefani wrote the scathing declaration reading in part, \u201cthe National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence.\u201d \u201cThe NRA has it coming to them, and I will do everything that I possibly can to call them out on what they are, which is a domestic terrorist organization,\u201d said Stefani.\n\nThey have it coming to them, huh? An organization that hasn\u2019t advocated for violence, fights for a constitutionally-protected right, and has no known members engaged in violence has the label \u201cterrorist organization\u201d coming to them?\n\nSure.\n\nWhen did the board of supervisors declare Antifa\u2013a group that routinely engages in violence in an effort to create political change? I don\u2019t recall seeing that announcement. Funny, that.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s statement was pretty much dead on.\n\nThe NRA responded with a statement reading in part, \u201cThis ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few. The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans.\u201d\n\nSome people have their own issues with the NRA, but let\u2019s be clear here. This is stupid. This is nothing more than the San Francisco Board of Supervisors grandstanding and flexing their non-existent muscles. It carries no bite to it in the least. It\u2019s nothing but an anti-gun town council trying to remind everyone that they\u2019re really anti-gun.\n\nMeanwhile, the city can\u2019t deal with the very real problems the NRA points out in their statement. It seems to me that they need to spend a little less time virtue-signaling and a little more time cleaning the literal crap off of their streets. I mean, if they\u2019re going to tell the rest of us how to live and what issues we should support, they should be working to make sure you don\u2019t pray that what you stepped in was dog poop.\n\nThe board\u2019s declaration has no real teeth to it and it won\u2019t actually accomplish anything, but it\u2019s still funny that they\u2019ll label a group that hasn\u2019t actually broken any laws a terrorist organization while ignoring Antifa and groups like them. Hell, even labeling white nationalist groups as terrorists would make more sense than slapping that title on the NRA.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s not like anti-gunners have ever really bothered with things like facts, reality, or anything similar.", "description": "The San Francisco Board of Supervisors made the declaration about the same time some poor schlub stepped in human feces somewhere in their city.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
