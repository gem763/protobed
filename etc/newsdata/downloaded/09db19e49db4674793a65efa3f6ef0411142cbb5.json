These are allies of ours that American soldiers are still continuing to fight alongside. All we did was arm them and they fought for America,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to leave them and abandon them.\u201d\n\nMcCain then directed her anger at anyone who supports the president\u2019s decision.\n\nMEGHAN MCCAIN SMACKS DOWN JOY BEHAR'S CLAIM ECONOMY IS SLOWING: 'THAT'S JUST FAKE NEWS'\n\n\u201cTo everyone in the White House and every Republican who was mad that President Obama pulled out of Iraq, you feckless, unpatriotic cowards,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot believe this is where we\u2019re at, diplomatic wise.\u201d\n\nMcCain added, \u201cThis is a great day for ISIS\u2026 shame on everyone who is supporting this.\u201d\n\nTURKISH PRESIDENT SNUBS BOLTON, ANGRY OVER CALL TO PROTECT KURDISH FIGHTERS IN SYRIA\n\nMcCain said it could be a \u201cwag the dog\u201d situation but reminded viewers that Trump \u201cran on isolationism.\u201d\n\nCo-host Joy Behar also chimed in, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction from the second whistleblower.\u201d\n\nTrump first made waves on the issue in December 2018, when he abruptly announced the U.S. would completely pull its troops from Syria, tweeting that the mission to defeat ISIS was completed. The move prompted the resignation of then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and a coordinated campaign by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton to try to protect the Kurds, America's fighting partner in the region.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe decision sent shockwaves through the region and Washington, with U.S. officials telling Fox News that top Pentagon officials were \u201ccompletely blindsided\u201d and \u201cshocked\u201d by the order to pull back hundreds of U.S. troops, a move that effectively green-lights the Turkey operation.\n\n\"The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no end in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,\" Trump tweeted on Monday.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gerren Keith Gaynor and Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.", "description": "ABC News\u2019 \u201cThe View\u201d co-host\u00a0Meghan McCain blasted \u201cfeckless, unpatriotic cowards\u201d who support President Trump\u2019s decision\u00a0to pull U.S. troops from northern\u00a0Syria during a scathing rant Monday.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
