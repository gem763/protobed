Another thing that is also true is that hurtful things and hateful things often come at us in the form of humor, and we just have to learn how to handle both of those things.\n\n\u201cWhen a piece of art that is out there to challenge conventions does something that\u2019s really harmful, then I think it\u2019s time to turn it off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we get to have those debates.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate, made the comments after several comedians came under fire recently for telling politically incorrect jokes. Dave Chappelle was panned by critics for his latest Netflix special mocking transgender people, Asians and rape victims, among others, and more recently \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Shane Gillis was punted from the NBC program last month amid an outcry over his past use of racist and homophobic slurs.\n\n\u201cI will say that there comes a point where you\u2019re just straight up hurting people, and I don\u2019t know what goal you\u2019re hoping to achieve,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said on Snapchat. \u201cAs much as there has been a lot of political correctness, there\u2019s also this weird way in which it\u2019s become fashionable to attack political correctness that I think has become its own weird correctness out there.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I may be at risk of sounding simplistic, I\u2019m just coming at this from the perspective of, like, helping and hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cIs what we\u2019re doing every day, whether you\u2019re a politician or a comedian or an artist or a business person or whatever, are you doing more good than harm out there? And if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s time for some reflection and time for some adjustment.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, 37, is among a dozen candidates participating in a Democratic primary debate Tuesday evening. Recent nationwide polling has him among the top 10.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
