A particular video continues to haunt her. Lucy had been shooting all day with a porn studio and she liked the people she was working with, so when they asked her to do just one more scene, she said yes. Lucy ended up sucking a penis-shaped dildo that squirted out soapy white liquid. She couldn\u2019t stop giggling. It felt silly giving a blow job to what was essentially a bubble blower for fake cum.\n\nEverything seemed less comical when a fan messaged Lucy saying that they loved her new Pornhub upload. She freaked. The video wasn\u2019t supposed to feature on anything but small subscription-based site Wank It Now. Watching it back, Lucy was horrified. She doesn\u2019t do boy/girl material and the dildo looked far more realistic than she thought it would. Now people were assuming she was progressing onto more hardcore material. \u201cMy fans were sharing it around saying, \u2018oh my God, Lucy\u2019s doing proper porn now, she\u2019s got cum dribbling down her face\u2019,\u201d Lucy tells me, over the phone. \u201cI thought, \u2018no, I\u2019m really not.\u2019 Now I get loads of messages asking me to do boy/girl stuff.\u201d\n\nAfter the video, Lucy changed all her levels \u2013 the scorecard explaining to porn production companies how far you'll go. Now she won\u2019t touch sex toys, specifically fake cocks. Across her career as a performer, from camming to OnlyFans to porn shoots, Lucy has had hundreds of hours of footage stolen from her. Whether it\u2019s a video of her showering, making out with women, or full frontal nudes of her legs spread, someone will have uploaded it onto the internet.\n\nLucy is not unlucky. This is not some glitch in an otherwise fair system. Almost every time you watch free porn, whether on Pornhub or at the bottom of some obscure forum, it has been uploaded without the owners\u2019 permission. This means that everyone involved, from the performer to the producers, won\u2019t earn anything. Porn does not suffer from a piracy problem. Really, the industry as it is now couldn\u2019t exist without piracy \u2013 it actively relies upon it.\n\nAnd the issue began with Fabian Thymann, the man who built a billion-dollar porn empire. In 2012, Fabian Thylmann became so rich he installed a Bond villain-style aquarium in his house large enough to warrant paying a diver to come in every week to clean its coral reef. Fabian\u2019s cash injection came after his online-porn company Manwin (since renamed MindGeek) gained control of the top ten porn \u201ctubes\u201d. From Pornhub to YouPorn to RedTube, these YouTube knockoffs aggregate thousands of stolen pornographic videos and disseminate them online for free.\n\nThis investment might have earned Fabian $150 million, but not everyone did so well out of the rise of these websites. Users ripping porn from paid-for subscription sites and uploading them onto the tubes for free, left the value of porn studios\u2019 work vastly diminished. Performers who used to make $1,500 an hour now get $500. Meanwhile, porn production companies have to hire a permanent member of staff to scrape the internet for their stolen videos. It recently emerged that Pornhub is promoting and profiting from Girls Do Porn, a company being sued by 22 women for allegedly coercing women into having sex on camera before spreading those videos on the internet.\n\nWhen Napster and Limewire offered a similar service to Fabian\u2019s for the music industry \u2013 allowing users to upload stolen music for others to download \u2013 they were sued by the Recording Industry Association of America. But the porn studios didn\u2019t have the same amount of financial backing or political connections to threaten MindGeek out of business so were not able to take action in 2012.\n\nNow, sex workers operating on camming sites like LiveJasmin or subscription services like OnlyFans are having their content ripped and uploaded onto Pornhub for free. When they try to take action against this, it often feels like they are screaming against a brick wall.\n\nAfter Alessa Savage realised a threesome she shot for her OnlyFans page had been uploaded onto Pornhub without her permission, she felt really tired. Alessa knew there wasn\u2019t much she could actually do to get the video back. \u201cI didn\u2019t even bother reporting it,\u201d she tells me down the phone. \u201cI just left it. Even if Pornhub took it down, there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop the user re-uploading, you can\u2019t steal that content back off them.\u201d\n\nLucy has managed to get her work taken down off Pornhub, but says it\u2019s an arduous process. \u201cYou have to prove you\u2019re the owner of the video. Often people send them the original, unedited footage. If you can\u2019t prove it, they won\u2019t take it down.\u201d According to Lucy, you have to nag sites like Pornhub several times before they listen. \u201cThey make it such a struggle to take it down because they want the content; they are always on the side of the person uploading it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent money on travel, renting the location, hiring film cameras, photographers, lingerie, hair, nails, \u00a3400 STI tests. Someone would have paid \u00a315.99 for a month's subscription to my OnlyFans account, and in ten minutes he would have downloaded it all, uploaded it \u2013 done.\" \u2014performer Alessa Savage\n\nMeanwhile, Elle Brooke, who found her content uploaded for free onto illegal forum The Fappening Blog, spends around 30 minutes everyday scrolling online to see if someone has ripped her work. \u201cPeople have told me I\u2019m on Pornhub. I must have a blonde doppelg\u00e4nger because every time I search \u2018Elle Brooke\u2019 nothing comes up. But then they must have uploaded it under a different name so I can\u2019t find it.\u201d\n\nAlessa\u2019s stolen threesome video frustrated her from a financial point of view. \u201cI spent money on travel, renting the location, hiring film cameras, photographers, lingerie, hair, nails, we had to get STI tested, which costs 400 quid a pop. We all put a lot of effort into it, getting everyone in the same place at one time, actually doing the shoot, editing the video \u2013 I\u2019m not a professional, so it takes me ages to put something half decent together.\" Alessa uploaded the video to her OnlyFans where someone ripped it and uploaded it onto PornHub. \"He would have paid \u00a315.99 for a month's subscription to my OnlyFans account, and in ten minutes he would have downloaded it all, uploaded it, done.\u201d\n\nFrom that highlighter she bought that picks up nicely on her cheekbones on camera, to the expensive acrylics nails, the money Alessa spent on her work is now helping to line someone else\u2019s pockets. The more views Alessa\u2019s video gets, the more money the anonymous uploader makes through advertising.\n\nWhile that financial side irritates Alessa, the part that hurts her the most is the principle that some people think it is OK to steal from porn stars. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to explain why this was wrong if it were any other art form. If someone was stealing Hollywood movies or leaking Cardi B\u2019s new album, they would instantly see why that is not OK. But, people just don't see it like that; they see porn as something they shouldn't have to pay for.\u201d\n\nWhen I emailed the porn tubes asking what they were doing to prevent piracy, RedTube didn\u2019t reply after several requests for comment. PornHub pointed out that it\u2019s free to use their digital fingerprinting software which scans new uploads for potential matches for copyrighted material (however, this only works if you're uploading your video directly onto PornHub \u2013 it's useless if someone else has ripped your content from OnlyFans or another website). YouPorn referenced how piracy is against their terms of service and how they take quick action when a video has been taken without permission. XHamster say they are working on improving their AI to track down stolen uploads, but point out that it is difficult when they receive 7000 new videos a day. XHamster also recommends that performers embed digital watermarks to allow them to identify content and block it before it is uploaded.\n\nPorn stars don\u2019t make as much money as they used to, and that\u2019s a direct result of a cultural expectation that porn should be free. Having work stolen means they have to work harder to make less. Their bodies are used to help rich men install giant fish tanks into their mansions.\n\nWhen I asked Alessa what she would say to the person who uploaded her video illegally, she replied: \u201cThey should get out there and start shooting their own, because there is a market out there for everyone. Even if they are out there living in their mum's basement, someone is going to want to watch them wank, so just do it for yourself. Why are you being a little thief, it\u2019s lame man, it\u2019s lame.\u201d\n\n@annielord8", "description": "Free sites like PornHub and YouPorn depend entirely on content stolen from performers and sex workers.
