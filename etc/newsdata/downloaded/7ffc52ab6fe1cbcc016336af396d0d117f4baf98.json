That didn\u2019t really get shown.\u2019\n\nDespite having the word \u2018love\u2019 in its title, Love Island came under some criticism this year for focusing too heavily on romantic relationships between the Islanders at the expense of their friendships and sillier stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I feel like hopefully for the next one they\u2019ll show a lot more of the funny things because I think a lot of people really wanna see that stuff,\u2019 Lucie said, \u2018I think it\u2019s really relatable and it\u2019s entertaining, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nWith boyfriend Joe Garratt (Picture: Bob Grey/BACKGRID)\n\nWe have to agree with you there, Lucie!\n\nSince leaving the villa, the TV personality has rekindled things with her on/off partner Joe, with the couple having met on their first day in the villa.\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk about their flourishing romance, Lucie revealed: \u2018We just didn\u2019t like anyone else. He really liked me, I really liked him. We weren\u2019t looking for anyone else.\n\n\u2018We went on the show to find someone so we just had that connection straight away. So coming home we\u2019ve got to know each other a lot more outside the villa so we\u2019re enjoying it and we\u2019re back together.\u2019\n\nLover Island is available to stream on the ITV Hub.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
