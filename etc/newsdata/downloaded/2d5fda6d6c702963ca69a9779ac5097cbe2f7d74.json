As for the match itself, it was another scintillating performance from the hosts who topped their pool with a 100 per cent record and now go on to play South Africa in the quarter finals.\n\nThe defeat means Scotland are on their way back home early having failed to make it out of the pool stages and pressure is mounting on head coach Gregor Townsend. However, former Scotland international Craig Chalmers says it's no time to panic just yet, and he's backing Townsend to turn things around during the Six Nations.\n\nIreland qualified at Scotland's expense. Despite spending more than half the game with 14 men, they eased past Samoa and now face the prospect of tackling tournament favourites New Zealand in the last eight. Ex-Ireland international Mike McCarthy played against the All Blacks and he joins the show to make a case for his former side.", "description": "After a surreal week for the sport, Brian Moore is joined in the studio by World Cup winner Maggie Alphonsi to reflect on the highs and lows both on and off the pitch.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/n5G36ZmNiIg/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
