The Bank of England\u2019s credit conditions survey shows that business lending remained more or less flat as a pancake for the three long years after the EU referendum. That\u2019s changed and not in a good way.\n\nThe latest update shows a decline in the third quarter of 2019 which is expected to accelerate during the current quarter. If lending performs in line with expectations for the final three months of 2019, it will show the sharpest decline since the run up to the financial crisis.\n\nThat statement demands a little context. In the absence of an economic earthquake, the decline won\u2019t come close to the slump the Bank\u2019s graphs show occurred in the latter part of 2007 when the UK was in the midst of the global credit crunch.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t bode well for UK plc. If businesses aren\u2019t borrowing they aren\u2019t investing. They\u2019re cutting.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to ask at this point whether the squeeze is caused by the banks or whether its down to a lack of appetite from their customers. The answer is that it\u2019s a bit of both.\n\nOn the day data was released, NatWest trumpeted that it was pumping a couple of extra billion into its \u201cBrexit preparation fund\u201d for small businesses. NatWest is, of course, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority owned by the Brexit-backing government. Smart move on the part of its bosses, then.\n\nBut across the entire market, when you look at big- and medium-sized businesses, as well as small ones, the fact is that the banks are tightening up. They\u2019re just doing it at a time when demand from their customers is also weak.\n\nThis chimes with what I was recently told by a major bank. While it expected to hit its lending targets I was told this had been a struggle. Its customers were willing to borrow to fund their day to day activities but not to do anything more than that. So no investment.\n\nThis has been the case pretty much since the Brexit vote landed and explains why the Bank\u2019s chart has been flatlining for so long. You would expect businesses\u2019 day to day borrowing to be fairly constant at a time when the economy has basically been flatlining. It\u2019s the big projects that introduce an element of volatility into the figures.\n\nThe decline that\u2019s emerged in the most recent quarter is a real cause for concern because it paints a picture of both banks and businesses battening down the hatches.\n\nAh but, I hear you say, hasn\u2019t BoZo the Downing Street clown got a Brexit deal of sorts? Mightn\u2019t that change things?\n\nThe \u201csharpest decline in business borrowing since the financial crisis\u201d, is, after all, only an expectation for what the next set of numbers will show. If a deal is signed, sealed and delivered, shouldn\u2019t that blow away some of the uncertainty, which is at the core of the UK\u2019s current economic malaise?\n\nOnly up to a point. Let\u2019s assume that BoZo ends up with a smile on his face after pulling off achieving something he helped to prevent Theresa May from achieving by getting his deal through parliament, a big if until MPs\u2019 votes are cast and counted.\n\nSuch an outcome would take no deal \u2013 a scenario that causes businesses nightmares with good reason \u2013 off the table. So the most cancerous uncertainty would be removed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Sure the UK will enter a temporary transition period under the current EU rules but uncertainty will remain until the UK\u2019s final trading relationship with its biggest market is settled.\n\nTrade tensions and stalling growth, meanwhile, make the global backdrop to all this a troubled one.\n\nEven if the credit squeeze isn\u2019t as bad as the data suggests it will be, there aren\u2019t, sadly, too many grounds for optimism.", "description": "On top of all its other economic problems, is Britain facing a corporate credit crunch?\u00a0The Bank of England\u2019s credit conditions survey shows that business lending remained more or less flat as a pancake for the three long years after the EU referendum.
