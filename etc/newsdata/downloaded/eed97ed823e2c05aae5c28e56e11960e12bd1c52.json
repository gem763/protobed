Col. Alexander Vindman will testify that he heard Trump\u2019s now-infamous July call with the Ukrainian president and twice raised concerns to his superiors, conservative pundits began accusing him of dual loyalty.\n\nVindman, a decorated Iraq War veteran who emigrated from Ukraine as a child, these right-wing talkers said, is not sufficiently loyal to the United States and may even be a double agent for his homeland.\n\nOn her Monday evening Fox News show, host Laura Ingraham and her guest John Yoo, the Bush-era \u201cTorture Memos\u201d author, focused on the fact that Vindman is a Ukrainian-American immigrant. Yoo even accused Vindman of being a spy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a decorated colonel, by the way, in the Iraq War,\u201d declared Ingraham, a leading Trump booster on cable-news primetime. \u201cBut because Colonel Vindman emigrated from Ukraine along with his family when he was a child and is fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, Ukrainian officials sought advice from him about how to deal with Mr. Giuliani, though they typically communicated in English.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English,\u201d she continued. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d\n\nYoo replied, \u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nDespite the immediate online backlash that both Yoo and Ingraham received for openly suggesting that Vindman is a Ukrainian spy, the Trump-friendly talking points were recycled yet again by pro-Trump cable stars on Tuesday morning.\n\nOn Fox & Friends, Trump\u2019s favorite morning show, co-host Brian Kilmeade repeatedly claimed that Vindman came \u201cfrom the Soviet Union\u201d while asserting the Iraq War veteran\u2019s sympathies lie with Kyiv.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s got a Purple Heart and he is from the Soviet Union,\u201d the Fox star said. \u201cHe immigrated here and has an affinity toward the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also know he was born in the Soviet Union, immigrated with his family, young,\u201d he added. \u201cHe tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone, former GOP congressman-turned-CNN pundit Sean Duffy dutifully launched a series of attacks on Vindman\u2019s loyalty.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that [Vindman] is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d the former MTV reality star said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about his concern [for] American policy, but his main mission was to make sure the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand it: We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from. Like me, I\u2019m sure that Vindman has the same affinity.\u201d\n\nDuffy, who since joining CNN last week has repeatedly used his new platform to regurgitate conspiratorial defenses of Trump, went on to suggest Vindman\u2019s loyalties lie with Ukraine because \u201che speaks Ukrainian, he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free.\u201d\n\nThe president, meanwhile, hadn\u2019t yet embraced this line of attack from his loyal media defenders as of publication but did blast Vindman for being an alleged \u201cNever Trumper\u201d who was simply misinterpreting the president\u2019s \u201cperfectly appropriate phone call.\u201d\n\nLast week, the president insisted that all \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d were \u201chuman scum\u201d and \u201cmore dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have pushed back on the burgeoning right-wing narrative about Vindman, however. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) on Tuesday called upon her fellow conservatives to stop questioning Vindman\u2019s loyalty, calling it \u201cshameful.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s almost as if the president\u2019s top sycophants at Fox News and CNN are reading from the same script.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona", "Tasia Jensen", "Video Journalist"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1397,w_2485,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572363798/GettyImages-1184187139_xm9t2z", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
