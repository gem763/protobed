Both sides blamed each other for fighting that has rattled the U.S.-brokered cease-fire.\n\nNearly two days into the five-day halt in fighting, the two sides were still trading fire around the key border town of Ras al-Ayn. There has also been no sign of a withdrawal of Kurdish-led forces from positions along the Syrian-Turkish border as called for under the agreement, reached between Turkey and the United States.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said it was \u201ccompletely abiding\u201d by the accord and that it was in \u201cinstantaneous coordination\u201d with Washington to ensure the continuity of calm. The ministry accused Kurdish-led fighters of carrying out 14 \u201cattacks and harassments\u201d the past 36 hours, most in the town of Ras al-Ayn, which is besieged by allied fighters before the cease-fire. It said the Syrian Kurdish fighters used mortars, rockets, anti-aircraft and anti-tank heavy machine guns.\n\nTurkey also said Saturday said it has recaptured 41 suspected Islamic State members who had fled a detention camp amid the chaos caused by the fighting earlier this week.\n\nThe Kurds, meanwhile, appealed to Vice President Mike Pence to enforce the deal saying Turkey has failed to abide by its provisions and has continued the siege of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said there were still clashes inside Ras al-Ayn and medical personnel could not enter to help the wounded.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Turkish-backed fighters entered Syria and advanced into Kurdish-held Shakariya, a village east of Ras al-Ayn that saw clashes and a Turkish strike a day earlier.\n\nVideo posted online showed the fighters driving alongside the wall Turkey has erected along the border and boasting that they were headed on \u201can assault\u201d into Syria. The video did not show them crossing the border.\n\nSyrian state media said Turkish-backed fighters also made an \u201cinfiltration attempt\u201d south of Ras al-Ayn but were repelled in clashes with the Syrian government military that had just moved into the area. The reports gave no further details.\n\nThe Observatory said Saturday that Turkey-backed Syrian fighters have prevented a medical convoy from reaching Ras al-Ayn. It said a medical convoy arrived outside the town Friday but Turkey-backed factions closed the road ahead and behind, leaving it stuck outside Ras al-Ayn.\n\nThe agreement \u2014 reached in negotiations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 would virtually hand Turkey its aims in the invasion, requiring Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border during the cease-fire.\n\nThe Kurdish-led force, which said it was in contact with the Americans during the negotiations, said it will abide by the halt in fighting but has not committed to any pull-out. Erdogan warned Friday that Turkey will relaunch its assault on Tuesday when the deal runs out if the Kurdish fighters don\u2019t pull out of a zone 30 kilometers (20-miles) deep running the entire length of the border.\n\nOn Saturday, the Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 41 suspected Islamic State members were re-captured after fleeing a detention camp amid fighting earlier this week in Syria. He said 195 other suspected IS members had already been recaptured. He said the captured IS suspects would be relocated to areas controlled by Turkey in northern Syria, including Afrin and al-Bab.\n\nLast week, there were reports that after a Turkish shell landed near Ein Issa camp that holds members of IS families, more than 700 managed to flee amid the chaos.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run English language broadcaster TRT World said the IS members and families were captured by Turkey-backed Syrian opposition forces.\n\nErdogan has accused Syrian Kurdish forces of releasing some 750 IS members and families, amid Turkey\u2019s offensive. The Kurds say they broke out of their camp a week ago, attacking guards, amid heavy clashes and Turkish airstrikes nearby.\n\n___\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.
