REUTERS/Daniel Munoz/File Photo\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Sydney\u2019s business district should be freed of restrictions that have successfully curbed alcohol-related violence in Australia\u2019s largest city but hurt its economy and nightlife, a parliamentary panel recommended on Monday.\n\nThe measures, introduced in 2014, denied entry to bars and pubs after 1:30 a.m. and banned the sale of alcoholic drinks after 3 a.m.\n\nThe panel recommended the removal of those restrictions in Sydney\u2019s central business district but said they should be retained in the Kings Cross district, which had been a hotspot for alcohol-related violence before the measures.\n\nConsultancy firm Deloitte estimated the so-called lockout laws had cost Sydney\u2019s economy as much as A$16 billion ($10.8 billion) a year.\n\n\u201cRepealing lockouts in the central business district and Oxford Street is an important first step that will breathe oxygen into Sydney\u2019s night life,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor, Clover Moore, said.\n\nPeople arguing to retain the laws cited a sharp cut in alcohol-fuelled violence in the regulated areas, as well as a safer environment for emergency workers.\n\nThose opposed told the panel the laws had killed the city\u2019s night life and hit the viability of the music and creative arts industries.\n\nGladys Berejiklian, premier of the state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, indicated this month that she supported an easing of restrictions.\n\n($1=1.4804 Australian dollars)", "description": "Sydney's business district should be freed of restrictions that have successfully curbed alcohol-related violence in Australia's largest city but hurt its economy and nightlife, a parliamentary panel recommended on Monday.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435424834&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0AM", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
