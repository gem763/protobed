Russian law forbids travel to restricted zones, including Severodvinsk\n\nThe town of Severodvinsk experienced a surge in radiation readings after the reported explosion of a nuclear missile at a testing site in Nyonoska, 35 miles away\n\nThe US state department confirmed that the explosion of the 8 August in the sea off of Nyonoska was a 'nuclear reaction,' caused by an attempt to retrieve a 'nuclear cruise missile'\n\nThe US state department confirmed to Fox News that the diplomats were in the country on official travel after properly filing travel with the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nA report today said the three had been later released after a document check but are considered, by the Russian police, to have broken the law.\n\nIt was unclear how long they were held.\n\n'While in Severodvinsk, access to which is restricted for foreign nationals, they were unable to produce documents necessary for visiting the city,' said the REN TV report.\n\nOther reports suggested they were held in Severodvinsk.\n\nAn earlier US intelligence assessment found that the explosion on 8 August in the sea off Nyonoksa came during a recovery mission to salvage a lost Burevestnik missile from the beneath the surface.\n\nThis nuclear-powered missile - capable of flying for days on end as it probes weaknesses in Western defences - is reported to be ready to go to war by 2025.\n\nLast week US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas G. Di Nanno told a United Nations committee: 'The United States has determined that the explosion was the result of a nuclear reaction that occurred during the recovery of a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile.'\n\nA man in a radiation protective suit checks the helicopter which brought the injured military scientists to Moscow . The explosion on the 8 October killed five nuclear scientists and injured many more. It also caused a radiation spike in the city that the US attaches were travelling to, Severodvinsk\n\nHe went on: 'The missile remained on the bed of the White Sea since its failed test early last year, in close proximity to a major population centre.'\n\nThere were earlier disputes over whether the Burevestnik or another weapon was involved in what went wrong in the White Sea which local officials said had caused a radiation spike.\n\nPictures revealed the sea platforms or pontoons involved in the explosion after which Moscow was accused of a Chernobyl-style cover-up.\n\nOne appears to be seriously damaged.\n\nOne victim reportedly suffered a radiation dose 'one thousand times higher than lethal.'\n\nAt least five were killed in the explosion.\n\nAll were involved in Russian missile testing.\n\nRussian officials later said the Nyonoska area was safe and uncontaminated.\n\nThis contradicted a stark warning to locals from a military figure in the aftermath of the nuclear accident.\n\nHe warned villagers not to go to the site where the pontoons are washed up.\n\n'Those (radioactive) elements may still be there, in the sea,' he said.\n\n'The sea may throw out on the shore those things on the pontoons that were destroyed\u2026\n\nPhotographs and video of destroyed pontoons posted by the local resident of Nyonoksa. The residents have said that they died because the pontoon lifted them into the air. All of the people who were killed worked on missile testing at the facility. Locals have been advised not to approach the pontoons as they could still be radioactive\n\n'Some people are already planning to visit this place, to share all this. So I would like to warn you \u2013 you should not do this, because it can lead to problems that you are afraid of\u2026\n\n'Horrors would follow.\n\n'This is what I am warning you about.'\n\nHe also told villagers who live close to the testing site that one pontoon had exploded from underneath\u2026\n\n'They were killed because the pontoon was lifted up into the air.\n\n'And those on the pontoon got dreadful injuries.'", "description": "Three US military attaches were removed from a Russian train and held  while travelling from a town where a nuclear missile killed five scientists and a city that witnessed a radiation spike soon after.", "authors": ["Will Stewart For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19825822-0-image-a-13_1571299380221.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
