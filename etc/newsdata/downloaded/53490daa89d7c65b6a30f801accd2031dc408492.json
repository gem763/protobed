Since the discovery, over 4,000 exoplanets have since been found \u2013 1,900 of which have been confirmed. Professor Queloz and Professor Mayor's discovery is now regarded as a pivotal moment in astronomy that changed our understanding of our place in the universe. No planet other than those in our own solar system had ever been found before.\n\n'The chemistry that led to life has to happen elsewhere. So I am a strong believer that there must be life elsewhere.\n\n'Life doesn't just mean a green man coming to you, life started way before animals were crawling on the surface of earth.'\n\nHe says he is certain that in 100 years time aliens will be known to us but says that it is very 'realistic' that within 30 years scientists could develop a machine to allow us to detect aliens in distant solar systems.\n\nProfessor Queloz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics along with his research partner Dr Michel Mayor, the Swiss duo discovered 51 Pegasi b at the University of Geneva in 1995.\n\nTheirs was the first confirmation of the existence of an exoplanet, which is one which orbits a star other than our Sun.\n\nIt is now regarded as a pivotal moment in astronomy because no planet other than those in our own solar system had ever been found before.\n\nSince the discovery, Professor Queloz has successfully developed the Doppler technique to be more precise, leading to the discovery of further 1,900 or so confirmed exoplanets. One 10th of those were discovered by Professor Queloz himself.\n\nThe other half of the award was given to James Peebles, from Princeton University, US, 'for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology'.\n\nProfessor Michel Mayor (left) and Professor Didier Queloz worked together to discover the planet 51 Pegasi b in 1995, the first one to be discovered orbiting a star which isn't the Milky Way's sun\n\nProfessor Queloz said: 'I do hope that this Nobel Prize will help give a further boost for this fascinating question when we think about life on another planet.'\n\nHe added that he was convinced of life on other planets and that scientists would not be searching for it, if they did not think it existed.\n\nThe now Nobel Prize laureate missed the call from the committee informing him of his win\n\nBoth NASA and the European Space Agency are officially searching for life on other planets.\n\nThe now Nobel Prize laureate missed the call from the committee informing him of his win while busy in a meeting with colleagues - leaving it to a press officer from Cambridge to break the news to him.\n\nProfessor Queloz said: 'This morning I was just a Cambridge professor working with colleagues, and then all of a sudden my life changed entirely.'\n\nHe added: 'I was in a scientific meeting, absolutely focused by the scientific meeting. I know it is the week of Nobel Prize, but I didn't pay attention.\n\n'To tell you the truth, people mentioned the Nobel Prize early on when we made the discovery 20 years ago, and after some time it has been said.\n\nDr Queloz stated that life on other planets 'doesn't just mean a green man coming to you' and may be found in more basic forms that may help us to understand how life on earth started\n\n'In a way you get used to it, but also there are so many great discoveries elsewhere and so many programmes, so it tends to fade away from my mind, and I wasn't expecting it all this morning.\n\n'I was not really in the mood, because I was in the mood for the scientific meeting.'", "description": "Planet hunter Didier Queloz, 52, from Switzerland, says he is 'convinced' we are not alone.
