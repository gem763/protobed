In contrast, customer remediation boosted the bank's NIM by 2 basis points, as these fell in the first half of 2019 compared with the previous six months.\n\nSims will also discover the somewhat bemusing fact that not all the major banks include aspects of customer remediation in their NIMs.\n\nIn its results for the year to June 2019, the Commonwealth Bank said that its NIM held steady in the first six months of this year from the previous six months at 2.10 per cent. But the giant bank's operating expenses \u2013 which included close to $1 billion in remediation costs \u2013 were up by 2.5 per cent.\n\nAnd CBA boss Matt Comyn signalled that the Reserve Bank's rate cuts in June and July would reduce the bank's NIM by around 4 basis points in the 2020 financial year.", "description": "ACCC boss Rod Sims will need to become nimble with NIMs as he investigates allegations the banks are shortchanging their loyal customers on interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2676%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_398%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b776e4281da1faca7ee62e7354504f29281a3cee", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
