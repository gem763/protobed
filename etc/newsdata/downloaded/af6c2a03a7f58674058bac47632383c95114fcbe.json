If tensions turn into warfare, the factory-fresh F-35s could face an Iranian air force operating some of the oldest active fighters in the world.\n\nThe Iranians with their four-decade-old F-4s, F-5s and F-14s might not seem to have a chance against the Americans flying arguably the world\u2019s most advanced fighter aircraft. But history, and recent testing show how Iranian pilots flying old planes could defeat Americans flying brand-new ones.\n\nFor one, the F-35, while new, isn\u2019t necessarily a stellar aerial performer. In 2015 someone associated with the F-35 test effort leaked an official report explaining the stealth fighter\u2019s limitations in air-to-air maneuvers with an F-16.\n\n\u201cThe F-35 was at a distinct energy disadvantage,\u201d an unnamed F-35 test pilot wrote in a scathing five-page brief. \u201cInsufficient pitch rate,\u201d he added. \u201cEnergy deficit to the bandit would increase over time.\u201d\n\nThe complaints continued. \u201cThe flying qualities in the blended region (20 to 26 degrees [angle of attack]) were not intuitive or favorable,\u201d the pilot wrote, adding that there\u2019s no point for an F-35 pilot to get into a sustained, close turning battle with an enemy pilot. \u201cThere were not compelling reasons to fight in this region.\u201d\n\nThe pilot\u2019s revelations underscore what many observers long have suspected about the F-35. While its radar-evading qualities and high-end sensors might allow it to gain a favorable position for long-range missile shots, in a close fight the F-35 hardly excels.\n\nIf an Iranian pilot can survive a merge with an F-35 and engage the stealth fighter in a turning dogfight, the Iranian might just bag himself a stealth fighter. It\u2019s worth noting that the Iranian air force flies scores of fighters that excel precisely in that regime.\n\nAmerican-made F-5 Tigers, for instance. Former U.S. Navy pilot Francesco Chierici who flew F-5s in the adversary role, sang the plane\u2019s praise in a 2019 article for The War Zone. \u201cThe Tiger was clean, just an AIM-9 and a telemetry pod on the wingtips, and occasionally a centerline fuel tank,\u201d Chierici wrote. \u201cShe slipped through the \u2018number\u2019 (Mach 1) easily. \u2026 The F-5 was a pair of engines and wings. It was so simple \u2026\u201d\n\nAerodynamically, the F-5 will always be what we call a category-three fighter, where the F-35 and F-22 are now category-five fighters. Compared to modern jets, it is underpowered, slow and bleeds airspeed badly in a sustained turn, not to mention it has no stealth other than its tiny size. But with just a few modifications, the F-5 is being turned into a threat plane with a legitimate sting. The newest upgrades include an [electronically-scanned] radar, good [radar-warning] gear, chaff and flares, a jamming pod and a helmet-mounted cueing system for a high off-boresight IR (infrared-guided) missiles. A Tiger so outfitted can provide Super Hornets and F-35s a legitimate threat, especially in the training environment.\n\nIran indeed has been upgrading its F-5 fleet, although the modifications likely will not include the latest sensors and helmet sights.\n\nStill, all things being equal the F-5 despite its age might still possesses the agility to gain the advantage over an F-35. Again, provided the F-5 pilot survives the merge to a close-in fight.\n\nAlso From TNI: Donald Trump: The Worst President Ever?\n\nAlso From TNI: Donald Trump: Best President Ever?\n\nAlso From TNI: Why Japan Really Lost Pearl Harbor\n\nThat\u2019s a big assumption. F-35 pilots understand the limitations of their aircraft and certainly would do their best to avoid a dogfight. The Iranians might have to ambush the Americans in order to force the fight to close range. It\u2019s unclear how the Iranians might do so, given the Americans\u2019 huge advantage in sensors and situational awareness.\n\nDavid Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.
