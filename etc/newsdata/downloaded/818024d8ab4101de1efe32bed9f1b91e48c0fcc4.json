Riders plummeted down the nearly vertical 17-story chute\u2014taller than Niagara Falls\u2014at speeds up to 70 miles per hour. German for \u201cinsane,\u201d Verr\u00fcckt was designed to challenge the laws of physics. Visitors flocked to Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City, Kansas, to experience its thrill.\n\nThat is, until August 7, 2016, when the raft that 10-year-old Caleb Schwab was riding went airborne and hit a metal pole supporting a safety net, resulting in his decapitation and instant death.\n\nNathan Truesdell, a filmmaker from nearby Missouri, heard about the devastating incident on the news. \u201cMy first thought was that it must have been a freak accident\u2014what a horrible, horrible story,\u201d Truesdell told me. \u201cBut once I took a closer look, I started to realize how complicated this story really was, and how this could have happened to anyone who went down that slide.\u201d\n\nThe story, it turned out, was one of gross negligence, lax state regulations, and the consequences of hubris. Truesdell\u2019s chilling short documentary The Water Slide, premiering on The Atlantic today, uses news and promotional footage to depict the ill-conceived project and its tragic fallout.\n\nIn 2012, the Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry, together with the senior designer John Schooley, fast-tracked Verr\u00fcckt\u2019s construction to coincide with an appearance on a reality TV show about amusement parks. (They were also gunning for a Guinness World Record.) Although they had built rides before, neither Henry nor Schooley had a background in mechanical engineering. And according to state law, they didn\u2019t need those credentials to deem their own ride safe\u2014unlike in the neighboring state of Missouri, water parks in Kansas do not require inspections by a state agency.\n\nAs chance would have it, Schwab\u2019s father was a Kansas state representative. On the day of Caleb\u2019s accident, the Schwab family had been visiting the water park for Elected Official Day, an annual promotion from Schlitterbahn that offered free admission to Kansas elected officials and their families.\n\n\u201cThere wasn't a lot of science or ride engineering involved in the testing and design,\u201d Truesdell said. \u201cThey were sending sandbags down and basically hoping that they didn't fly off of the slide. The netting that ultimately ended up killing the child was added to prevent the rafts from flying off of the slide completely.\u201d\n\nIn the film, Schooley speaks to a reporter after having tested the ride himself. \u201cThat was really exciting because we truly didn\u2019t know whether we were going to survive it or not,\u201d he says. \u201cA ride might be scary, but you figure that they have it figured out. We didn\u2019t know whether we had it figured out or not.\u201d\n\nHenry and Schooley were ultimately indicted on charges of aggravated battery, aggravated endangerment of a child, interference with law enforcement, and involuntary manslaughter. Henry faced a charge of second-degree murder. The state alleged that the two men had rushed forward with the ride\u2019s construction without the technical expertise required to design a properly functioning waterslide, skipped \u201cfundamental steps in the design process,\u201d and relied \u201calmost entirely on crude trial-and-error methods\u201d for safety testing.\n\nAccording to court documents, a team of experts who inspected the ride after Caleb's death found \u201cphysical evidence that indicated that other rafts had gone airborne and collided with the overhead hoops and netting before the fatality.\u201d What\u2019s more, on July 3, 2014\u2014one week before the ride\u2019s grand opening\u2014an engineering firm that was hired to perform accelerometer tests on Verr\u00fcckt\u2019s rafts issued a damning report that \u201cguaranteed that rafts would occasionally go airborne in a manner that could severely injure or kill the occupants.\u201d Other documents cited evidence of dozens of Schlitterbahn customers who had been injured on the ride. Schlitterbahn allegedly buried or downplayed these reports.\n\nIn February, a judge dismissed the charges against Henry and Schooley. The water park is now closed, and the slide has been demolished.\n\n\u201cWe are good at sending thoughts and prayers,\u201d Truesdell quipped.", "description": "A fatal accident at a waterslide park was the result of gross negligence, lax state regulations, and a whole lot of hubris.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/08/Water_Slide_Site/video-featured.jpg"}
