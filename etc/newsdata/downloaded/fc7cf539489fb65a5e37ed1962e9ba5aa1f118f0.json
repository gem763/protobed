I think it\u2019s probably a little intimidating if you haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d\n\nLanding Brad for the role was something that Crane admitted was a dream of the writing team, who really wanted him to say yes.\n\n(Image: Warner Brothers)\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nHe admitted that they \"really went after\" Brad as they desperately wanted him to act with Jennifer.\n\nCrane continued: \u201cObviously, it was up to him, and it was up to [Jennifer], and it was just a great piece of casting. When he said yes, we were thrilled.\u201d\n\nBrad and Jen were in the middle of their relationship when the episode aired and despite there being some animosity when he hooked up with Angelina Jolie , the pair have since reconciled.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
