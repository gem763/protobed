Read the obituary (Andrew Harnik/For The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nThat first year, according to Regardie\u2019s, Mr. Sturtevant asked Maret parents to arrange social gatherings in their Cleveland Park neighborhood where the school is now located. There he would plead his argument that Maret would be a good school for their children. He recruited 225 students his first year.\n\n\u201cA headmaster has to be a good salesman and a good actor,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Albert Sturtevant was born in Washington on Sept. 5, 1930. His father was a stocks and securities broker. He graduated in 1948 from the private Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Connecticut. At Harvard, he was asked to leave during his sophomore year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cToo much flamboyance! I didn\u2019t study,\u201d he told Regardie\u2019s. He graduated in 1953 from Rollins College in Florida. He ran an auto dealership in Baltimore then in 1963 received a law degree at George Washington University. He taught and coached at the all-boys Landon School in Bethesda, Md., before joining the Maret staff as development director.\n\nAD\n\nAs the chief helmsman of a private preparatory school, Mr. Sturtevant was an anomaly. There was no rule book. Law and order was administered on an ad hoc basis. A Jewish student who complained that matzoh was unavailable in the school cafeteria on Passover was invited to share matzoh peanut butter sandwiches with the headmaster in his office.\n\nHe told a teacher asking for a pay raise that she would make a good used car salesman. This was a complement, she later learned. Into gatherings of kindergartners he sometimes tossed a large yellow banana. The child who caught it got to ask the head of the school any question he chose.\n\nAD\n\nThere was a story told at his retirement about a kindergarten student who had two gerbils, both of which were named \u201cMr. Sturtevant.\u201d One morning the child discovered that one had devoured the other. The headmaster\u2019s response: \u201cNow he knows which is the REAL Mr. Sturtevant.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo the Maret campus on Cathedral Avenue, where the main building once functioned as a summer White House in the 19th-century administrations of Presidents John Tyler, Martin Van Buren, James Buchanan and Grover Cleveland, Mr. Sturtevant added buildings. He beefed up the school\u2019s academic program.\n\nIn retirement Mr. Sturtevant lived in Maine, Chestertown, Md., and Sanibel, Fla. He was a fly fisherman and a sailor.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to the former Frances Seiberling, ended in divorce. His second wife, Janet Knox Sturtevant, died in 1982.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 28 years, Linda Webber Sturtevant of Brooklin and Sanibel; a daughter from his first marriage, Elizabeth Sturtevant of Battle Ground, Wash.; three sons from his second marriage, William N. Sturtevant III of Durham, N.H., Peter Albert Sturtevant Jr. of Washington and Thomas K. Sturtevant of New York City; two stepchildren, Philip Marriott of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Brooke Bartletta of Hingham, Mass.; and 17 grandchildren.\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He was credited with guiding the preparatory school\u2019s recovery from imminent collapse to financial and academic health.", "authors": ["Bart Barnes"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yMjXMFbQIG6S5-OCUHO8I0mDCW0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECFHXCHZZMI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
