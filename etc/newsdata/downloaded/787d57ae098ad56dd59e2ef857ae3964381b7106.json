The striker will miss Saturday's league fixture against Hibernian at Easter Road and will not be available for the Scotland squad to be announced by Steve Clarke on Tuesday for next month\u2019s Euro 2020 double header against Russia in Moscow and San Marino at Hampden Park.\n\nAs matters stand, Celtic are covered at both ends of the field. Christopher Jullien and Kris Ajer have bonded as a central defensive partnership, while Vakoun Bayo scored against Partick Thistle in the midweek Betfred Scottish League Cup quarter-final amidst a generally impressive all-round performance.\n\nThe 5-0 rout of a struggling Jags side expanded the category of obscure statistics with the news that, since he took charge for a second spell, Lennon has become the most successful Celtic manager over an opening passage of 31 games.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s down to the players,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I came in it was really, really difficult \u2013 and people on the outside might not appreciate that \u2013 but there were huge shoes to fill. And then you had to pick up at a really pressured time of the season, with big games. The changeover could have been difficult but the players made the transition as easy as it could possibly have been.\n\n\u201cThere will be so many twists and turns as the season goes on and you just try to keep a sense of perspective, whether things are good or bad.\u201d\n\nThe trip to Hibs takes on added significance as a preview of the sides\u2019 next meeting, in the Betfred Scottish League Cup semi-final at Hampden on November 2. Paul Heckingbottom\u2019s players responded to a home defeat by Hearts in last weekend\u2019s Edinburgh derby to beat Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Wednesday after extra time and penalties and Lennon said:\n\n\u201cFrom the psychological point of view, it\u2019s a big lift and it shows a bit of character after losing the derby at home. \u201cThey\u2019ve picked themselves up and gone to a difficult place and got through, but how much did that take out of them, with extra time and penalties on an artificial pitch which can be demanding?\u201d\n\nDerek McInnes is hopeful of Aberdeen's chances against Rangers Credit: Jane Barlow\n\nAt Ibrox, meanwhile, Rangers host an Aberdeen side ravaged by injuries. James Wilson has a knee strain and his attacking colleague Connor McLennan is struggling with a dead leg, while defenders Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor were already missing along with midfielders Stephen Gleeson, Funso Ojo, Craig Bryson and Scott Wright.\n\nThe Dons lost only two of seven meetings with Rangers last season and knocked Steven Gerrard\u2019s players out of both cup competitions.\n\n\u201cWe have had adversity to deal with in the past and probably have a wee bit of that to deal with at the minute with the injury situation, but we know that we can go down there and still put in a performance that can hopefully get a positive result against a very good Rangers team,\u201d said Derek McInnes, the Aberdeen manager.\n\nGerrard acknowledged the setbacks Rangers faced against Aberdeen last season, but declared that his squad have become more potent. \u201cWe believe we are better, we believe we have improved, recruited well and that we are in a good place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur last fixture here against Aberdeen, we played ever so well. We controlled the majority of the game and we found a real performance on the day. That is the game the players need to focus on, because it wasn\u2019t so long ago.\u201d\n\nOff the field, Aberdeen have won the Best Professional Football Club prize in the 2019 UEFA Grassroots Awards for the work done by their Community Trust (AFCCT), which \u2013 amongst other activities - has helped six local grassroots clubs to achieve the highest level of the Scottish FA\u2019s club accreditation scheme. It is also active in 13 partner schools, organising football-related health and wellbeing activities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.", "description": "Celtic have suffered a major injury setback with the news that Jozo Simunovic will be absent for three to four months and could return to his native Serbia to address the rehabilitation work required after the surgical clean-out of a knee injury.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uk_.978IX4o1U4.7URRG1A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gaRp5wgzFi0cGDWWDcIoog--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/3fa2b61440187b7be1f2b65ceb3c49ae", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
