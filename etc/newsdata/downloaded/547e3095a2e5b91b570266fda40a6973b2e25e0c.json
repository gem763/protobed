Can't thank you enough as my dog is beside herself with fear at these times.'\n\nSainsbury's official Twitter account replied: 'Hey Sally, thanks! We won't be selling fireworks in any of our stores this year. Hope this helps!'\n\nMs Woolf then tagged other stores to urge them to follow suit.\n\nShe Tweeted: 'Please note @asda @morrisons @Tesco @waitrose.\n\n'Sainsburys aren't selling fireworks in any stores this year as it causes so much stress in pets, wildlife & kids. Please think about doing the same. #Diwali2019 doesn't have 2b celebrate with fireworks, it's a festival of light!'\n\nTypically supermarkets and other general retail outlets sell fireworks in the October to November period and for New Year, but do not sell at the other periods in most areas.\n\nSainsbury's is understood to be the first major retailer to carry a year-round ban.\n\nUsing or buying fireworks illegally can result in a \u00a35,000 fine or imprisonment for up to six months.\n\nAnimal charities welcomed the move.\n\nA spokesman for the Dogs Trust said: 'We congratulate Sainsbury's on their decision not to sell fireworks this year and would encourage others to do the same.\n\n'Although they can look beautiful, fireworks can be very distressing for dogs when let off unexpectedly, and because they are so easily accessible all year-round, dog owners are on tenterhooks as to when their beloved pooch will next be frightened.\n\n'A survey found over half of the British public think fireworks should be limited to public displays only.\n\n'To reduce the distress caused to dogs we would like their use restricted to licensed public displays at certain times of the year or organised events, which are well publicised. This will enable owners to take steps to prepare their dogs ahead of any fireworks events. Good for the dogs and good for firework fans.'\n\nA Sainsbury's spokesperson confirmed they would not be selling fireworks this year.\n\nA spokesman said: 'Fireworks are no longer available in our stores but customers can continue to choose from a range of seasonal products, such as glow sticks and light up spinning wands.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted Tesco, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl and the Co-op for their position on the sale of fireworks.", "description": "Animal welfare charities have praised Sainsbury's decision.
