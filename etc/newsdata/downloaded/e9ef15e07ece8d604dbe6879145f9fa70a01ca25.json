REUTERS/Santiago Arcos\n\nIndigenous people at the heart of Ecuador\u2019s biggest protests in more than a decade are vowing to stay on the streets unless President Lenin Moreno repeals austerity measures linked to securing a $4.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re defending the country. He\u2019s doing everything wrong,\u201d said Maria Lourdes Castillo, a 26-year-old broccoli picker from the highland province of Cotopaxi as she took off her shoes to rest her feet during a brief break from protests.\n\nCastillo, wearing a traditional bowler hat and layered skirt, said Moreno\u2019s decision to end a four-decade subsidy on fuel had already started to push up prices on a wide range of products. \u201cBut our wages won\u2019t go up. They never do,\u201d she said.\n\nProtests that started a week ago burgeoned into a massive nationwide strike on Wednesday, with workers unions joining several thousand indigenous people marching in the highland capital as many more rallied around the provinces.\n\nIndigenous protesters from the provinces have used a cultural center as a base in Quito: teams of volunteers stay ready to tend to the wounded from clashes with police, while older women prepare squash stew in a giant pot.\n\nMany have slept in a park under heavy blankets brought from home.\n\nThe marches have forced Moreno to move his government to the coastal city of Guayaquil, where thousands also rallied to support him in counter-protests on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTHE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT\u201d\n\nBut Moreno has refused to overturn the measures and has blamed unrest - without evidence - on his leftist predecessor Rafael Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nIndigenous protesters say Moreno, who has been careful to distinguish between violent troublemakers and his \u201cindigenous brothers\u201d, is nevertheless trying to de-legitimize their demands.\n\n\u201cHe can blame whoever he wants but he knows the people are right,\u201d said Pedro Aranga, a 60-year-old street vendor and a native Quichua Ecuadorean. \u201cThis is hurting me and it hurts all of us. We don\u2019t have much money to spend.\u201d\n\nAranga said a large sack of potatoes in his local market had risen from $20 to $60 \u2013 out of reach for him and many others.\n\nMoreno\u2019s government has blamed retail vendors for taking advantage of increased fuel prices to hike food more than necessary. Some police operations have targeted speculation in markets in Quito and Guayaquil.\n\nBut what started as a concrete demand to reinstate fuel subsidies has turned into wider protests with many calling for Moreno to step down. The shift is no small thing.\n\nIndigenous protests have been key detonators in pushing previous presidents from office.\n\nFormer mayor of Guayaquil Jaime Nebot participates in a \"White March\" calling for peace, in Guayaquil, Ecuador October 9, 2019.

He said there wouldn\u2019t be an austerity package,\u201d said Victoriana Quingallo, a 33-year-old potato farmer who traveled to Quito with her children for the protest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay here until it\u2019s all repealed!\u201d", "description": "Some walked to Quito from the countryside.
