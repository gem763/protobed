They will be a big threat, and I will be nervous if we play them,\u201d Erasmus admitted to reporters in Kobe.\n\n\u201cJapan is a much bigger threat than people think and they beat Ireland the other day. I\u2019m not quite sure who would be the easier bet. Scotland can also still sneak in there.\u201d\n\nThe Pool A equation will only be decided on Sunday, but for now the Bok players are enjoying two days off after 16 weeks together and a World Cup campaign that is building momentum.\n\nTheir forward domination has been a feature of the tournament so far and will continue to be their key weapon.\n\nItaly coach Conor O\u2019Shea believes they are potentially the most powerful side ever to take to a rugby field after watching his team get bullied in a 49-3 loss in Fukuroi City.\n\nOnce a platform has been laid up front, the Boks are able to unleash their skilful and pacy backs, and in wings Cheslin Kolbe and Makazole Mapimpi have two lethal finishers.\n\nErasmus has so far been able to rotate his squad, with each of the 31 players having made at least one start, ensuring rest for those that need it and game-time for those feeling on the fringes.\n\n\u201cWe are in a good position in terms of personnel, but from now on it counts for nothing. You lose one game and you are out,\u201d Erasmus said.\n\nA record of 27 tries scored and three conceded in their four pool games speaks to the structure and organisation of the Boks, and that is what opposing teams will find difficult to break down.\n\nAn area to ponder for Erasmus is the back-up fly-half role to Handre Pollard, with Elton Jantjies blowing typically hot and cold, though 2007 World Cup winner Frans Steyn and Damian Willemse are options there as well.\n\nWillie le Roux has also had a underwhelming tournament as the first-choice full-back and could face pressure in his position from Willemse and Warrick Gelant.", "description": "South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has ticked the boxes on a successful Pool B campaign at the Rugby World Cup which, despite an opening defeat to New Zealand, may provide them with a gentler route to the final in Yokohama on Nov. 2.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438649784&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98018", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
