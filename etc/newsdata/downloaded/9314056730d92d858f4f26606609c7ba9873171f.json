Ron Johnson of 'Fox News conspiracy propaganda' on Ukraine", "language": "en", "text": "NBC anchor Chuck Todd on Sunday accused Sen. Ron Johnson of engaging in \u201cFox News conspiracy propaganda\u201d after the Wisconsin Republican blasted efforts to sabotage President Trump and raised questions about Ukraine\u2019s role in 2016 election interference.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here. I have no idea,\u201d said Mr. Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nHis \u201cpropaganda\u201d allegation came as Mr. Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, cited his concerns about the extent to which leaks from the intelligence community regarding the Ukraine have fueled the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nDuring the combative interview, Mr. Johnson said the president\u2019s foes constructed \u201cthis false narrative that resulted in him being set up by [former FBI director] James Comey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he has this special counsel appointed that has hampered his entire administration and now once that was proven false, he would like to know, and I would like to know, and I know his supporters would like to know, where did this all come from?\u201d asked the Minnesota Republican. \u201cWho planted that false story? Who leaked?\u201d\n\nAn angry Mr. Todd jumped in with, \u201cSen. Johnson, please! Can we please answer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u2019re not criticizing him?\u201d\n\nWATCH: In an exclusive interview with Meet the Press, @SenRonJohnson (R-Wis.) turns questions about President Trump\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president into unfounded attacks on Democrats. #MTP https://t.co/tjLwXg1o8H pic.twitter.com/xf8UdbiN0m \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) October 6, 2019\n\nMr. Johnson, a supporter of military aid to the Ukraine, said he was upset after hearing over the summer allegations that Mr. Trump was seeking to condition the aid to an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s involvement in his son Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nWhen Mr. Johnson asked the president about a quid pro quo, he said \u201che completely denied it. He adamantly denied. He vehemently, angrily denied it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, I\u2019d never do that,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cSo that is the piece of the puzzle I\u2019m here to report today. Unlike the narrative of the press, that President Trump wants to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent, what he wants is an accounting of what happened in 2016. Who set him up? Did things spring from the Ukraine?\u201d\n\nHe cited a 2017 article in Politico saying that \u201cUkrainian officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is potential Ukrainian interference in 2016,\u201d said Mr. Johnson. \u201cThat is what Trump wants to get to the bottom of.\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said afterward it was \u201cwild, the lengths to which Republicans are going to try to avoid being criticized by this president.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s a good friend, but I\u2019m deeply scared by the positioning that Republicans have chosen to take. That interview was just a giant green light to the president of the United States to continue to solicit foreign interference in U.S. elections,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\n\nMr. Johnson argued that, \u201cI want to get to the truth. I\u2019m not defending the president. I\u2019m not here to denounce him either.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he reason he had very legitimate concerns and reservations about Ukraine was first, corruption\u2014generalized, it\u2019s endemic, we all know that\u2014and then specifically about election interference in the 2016 election,\u201d said Mr. Johnson\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
