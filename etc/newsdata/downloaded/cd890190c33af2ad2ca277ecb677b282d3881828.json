Your favourite comics artist\u2019s favourite comics artist, a status cemented by the just-ended five-year marathon spent as the draftsman on award-winning pop music super-drama The Wicked + The Divine. For his next trick, he\u2019s going full cartoonist, writing and drawing an all-new sci-fi series and he told Kotaku all about it.\n\nAfter a half-decade at the drafting table making one of the modern era\u2019s most buzzed-about comics, one would think that McKelvie might allow himself a nice long holiday. As far as I can tell, he took a measly month off. The reason? McKelvie wants to push himself even more.\n\nThe Wicked & The Divine's Creators Look Back At 5 Years Of Excellence And Exhaustion One of the best comics series in the last decade came to an end last week. As you\u2019d expect, writer Kieron Gillen and artist Jamie McKelvie have a lot of thoughts about saying goodbye to The Wicked & The Divine. Read more\n\nThe next gauntlet he\u2019s thrown down is scripting and drawing The Killing Horizon, an ambitious space saga of his own creation. The series reunites McKelvie with WicDiv colorist Matt Wilson and the pair are joined by letterer Aditya Bidikar, designer Cecile Richard, and editor Katie West. Here\u2019s McKelvie\u2019s boilerplate describing the project:\n\nThe post-post-apocalyptic future. Far from Earth, a specialist in studying dead alien societies is embedded with a military unit to excavate a new find. She\u2019s done it before. It\u2019s good work and it\u2019s safe. She thinks it\u2019s just another job. She\u2019s wrong. Lost and alone, deep beneath the warped, skeletal spires of the millennia-dead city, she finds something powerful. Something unlike anything any human has ever known. Something that needs her to take it on a journey no living being has ever taken. Something that will make her a target for every side fighting a deadly war. It calls to her. She answers.\n\nAfter debuting a teaser image on Instagram last week, McKelvie\u2019s talking about his new project for the first time. He corresponded with me over email earlier this week, answering questions about separating pleasure from profit, moving from fantasy magic to space opera, getting back to writing after so long away.\n\nJamie McKelvie: It\u2019s a big change. And that was kind of the impetus for it! I\u2019ve spent a good portion of my career doing things I know I\u2019m OK at. That\u2019s all good, but I wanted to challenge myself and expand what I\u2019m capable of. I never felt I was very good at the science fiction elements that appeared in my previous work. A lot of my career motivation has been spite: \u201cOh, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m good at that thing? I\u2019ll prove you wrong.\u201d So I\u2019m doing that to myself now. Is that healthy?\n\nIn terms of execution, the canvas becomes vast and that\u2019s more than a little bit scary for me. Humans are humans, cars are cars, you can generally recognise that a tree is a tree.\n\nThose boundaries vanish when you\u2019re doing a story like this. With such a drastic change of setting, storytelling possibilities expand out in all sorts of different directions. There\u2019s a sequence I\u2019m really excited about drawing that arose from a quandary: how do I approach this moment/image on the page? The story possibilities spill out into the \u201cstorytelling\u201d possibilities and that\u2019s got me buzzing.\n\nNarcisse: How is the main character of The Killing Horizon different than other protagonists you\u2019ve brought to life?\n\nMcKelvie: I\u2019m still discovering through writing her, I think. She\u2019s not a teenager, which is obviously a big departure! And so, unlike Laura at the start of WicDiv, she thinks she\u2019s got the life she wants. She might even think she\u2019s happy. But she\u2019s created an environment for herself where she can ignore the things about herself she doesn\u2019t want to work on. Obviously, that changes drastically. Finding out how she deals with that is really interesting to me.\n\nAn ominous teaser for Jame McKelvie\u2019s new sci-fi comic. (Image: Jamie McKelvie, Image Comics)\n\nNarcisse: Folks who follow you on Instagram will have seen you building miniature mechs. So there are going to be mechs in this, right? And is this going to be another worrisome case of turning something you love into work?\n\nMcKelvie: Hah, no mechs! Or at least, no human-built mechs. They just didn\u2019t fit into this world. It\u2019s funny, though; I do love making gunpla and Lego mechs because there\u2019s no way to monetise them and I really needed a creative outlet that wasn\u2019t something that earned me money. The mind goes to different places. There\u2019s a freedom that comes from it.\n\nYou know, I realised this week that I haven\u2019t sat down to work on any models since the day I finished WicDiv. The need for that pressure valve was gone.\n\nNarcisse: It\u2019s been a long time \u2014 the days of Suburban Glamour, to be specific \u2014 since you wrote anything for comics. Did you notice anything that changed in your process or approach as you\u2019ve been working on the new project?\n\nMcKelvie: My ambition. It always grows to outpace my ability, but I am really feeling it this time. It\u2019s pushing me.\n\nNarcisse: This feels like a weird but necessary thing to ask: Have any of Kieron Gillen\u2019s scripting tics rubbed off of on you, after collaborating with his old, sad self for five years on The Wicked and The + Divine?\n\nMcKelvie: It\u2019s such a different thing, writing for yourself. Kieron often talks about how a script is really a letter to the artist, which doesn\u2019t really apply when you\u2019re writing for yourself. But I suppose the biggest thing is the need to set challenges, push things, see what I can make comics do. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s his influence or if that\u2019s why we always worked well together because we already both had that same drive.\n\nNarcisse: Why did you feel the need to write this yourself, as opposed to partnering with someone?\n\nMcKelvie: It\u2019s interesting, a friend recently reminded me that back when I was starting out, I didn\u2019t consider myself an artist. I just drew as a method of telling the stories I wanted to tell. That got put aside for a long while. I don\u2019t mean to sound regretful about that, because of course I\u2019m not. I wouldn\u2019t have worked with Kieron for so long if I didn\u2019t love what we were doing. But it was always what I set out to do. And now I am lucky to be in the position to be able to see where that takes me.\n\nSpace explodes with colour, thanks to Matt Wilson (Image: Jamie McKelvie, Matt Wilson, Image Comics)\n\nNarcisse: How have you and Matt Wilson talked about the tones and palette for the new project?\n\nMcKelvie: As I mentioned last time I talked to you, having a long-running successful book is great, but it traps you in the decisions you made years ago. Now we have a chance to start afresh and we\u2019re looking at a lot of different approaches and thinking about how they may look and how they\u2019ll feed into the vibe of the story.\n\nI love working with Matt because he\u2019s willing to throw ideas back to me all the time. There\u2019s a lot of back and forth right now about possible directions. I\u2019m planning to start drawing in January so we have a bit of time.\n\nNarcisse: WicDiv called on you to draw a broad range of fashion and facial expressions because of the nature of the story it told and the characters it featured. These were ordinary young people dealing with the highly emotional drama of becoming superpowered pop stars. Are there similar considerations that are readily apparent now as you dive into a new kind of story?\n\nMcKelvie: The emotional core is always central for me. So even when we\u2019re dealing with space travel or interstellar politics or the ruins of millennia-old alien civilizations, I\u2019m still focused on how that pares down to the immediate world of the characters.\n\nThe fashion thing is a challenge, though! I can\u2019t rely as much on existing inspiration. But I\u2019m having a lot of fun with it. As always, it\u2019s about what the look says about the character.\n\nNarcisse: Is there a particular question you\u2019re trying to answer with the new thing?\n\nMcKelvie: There\u2019s a couple, for sure. I\u2019m not ready to talk about them all yet! But I\u2019m also writing my way through my thoughts on courage and/or lack thereof. When I stand up for things, when I don\u2019t, why I do, why I don\u2019t, what I can do to do a better job of it. That\u2019s making its way into the story in a big way.", "description": "Jamie McKelvie is one of those guys.
