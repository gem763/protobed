Ilhan Omar and former Vice President Joe Biden. He also managed to piss off the Prince estate.\n\nIn front of a crowd of more than 10,000 at the Target Center, Trump openly pushed debunked conspiracy theories about Omar, including that she married her brother to give him permanent residency status in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen scandals like Omar\u2019s, and nothing gets done about it,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cShe is a disgrace to our country,\u201d Trump added, jabbing his finger in the air as the crowd jeered around him. \u201cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I\u2019m very angry at you people right now.\u201d\n\nOmar has also long been one of Trump\u2019s favorite and most effective bogeywomen. Earlier this summer, he tweeted that Omar \u2014 who immigrated to the U.S. from Somalia as a refugee when she was 12 \u2014 should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which [she] came.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd his comments have so emboldened right-wing conspiracy theorists that earlier this year House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to request additional security for the freshman congresswoman, who she said was in \u201creal danger.\u201d\n\nBut Trump went further on Thursday night, claiming that the sizable Somali refugee community in Minneapolis burdens taxpayers and drains local resources.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise you that, as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration control,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe also pointed to Omar\u2019s boycott of Israel to imply that she is anti-American, at one point calling her an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said the U.S. support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d Trump said to cheers. \u201cRepresentative Omar has a history of launching virulent, anti-Semitic screeds, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAnd she is one of the big reasons that I\u2019m going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.\u201d\n\nLater, he turned his attention to a more recent obsession: the Biden family. He started with the former Vice President, his potential opponent in next fall\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cHe was never considered smart, he was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d Trump said of Biden on Thursday to thunderous applause from the crowd, before stepping away from the podium and shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nHe also made time to target Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?\u201d Trump jeered, referring to yet another conspiracy about Hunter\u2019s previous business dealings in China. Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son, kicked off the rally by suggesting that voters change his dad\u2019s infamous \u201clock her up\u201d chant from the 2016 election \u2014 which referred to Hillary Clinton \u2014 to \u201clock him up.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s obsession with the Bidens, of course, has made him and a colorful cast of associates the targets of a rapidly widening investigation by House Democrats. But while Democrats clamor to see Trump removed from office, he talked last night about serving several more terms.\n\n\u201c\u2018President, you\u2019ve been here now, for, think of it, almost three years, can you believe we\u2019re here three years?\u2019 We, we, it\u2019s we,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we have to promise them no more than 16 years, okay? No more. No more. Sixteen more years.\u201d\n\nHe then followed up with a wave of his hand, and said, \u201cI\u2019m only kidding. Now they\u2019ll go back and say, \u2018SEE, HE WANTS TO RUN FOR MORE!\u2019\u201d\n\nEven Prince\u2019s estate had something to say about Trump\u2019s rally, after the campaign played \u201cPurple Rain\u201d from the Minnesota rock icon \u2014 despite agreeing a year ago it wouldn\u2019t use any of Prince\u2019s songs on the trail.\n\n\u201cThe Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in Minneapolis.
