The U.S. is already home to more Hong Kongers than any country outside of mainland China, and recent data suggests more are looking to leave. Applications for a key emigration document, the \u201cgood citizenship card,\u201d are up 54 per cent in the past year, according to official data.\n\nBut anti-immigrant political rhetoric, high-profile incidences of gun violence and impending changes to the \u201cinvestor visa\u201d program have encouraged Hong Kong\u2019s would-be emigres to consider alternatives such as Australia, Canada, Singapore, and Taiwan.\n\nThe street demonstrations, which raise fundamental questions about the future of Hong Kong, escalated this month with the shootings of two teenage protesters by police.\n\nEven before the protest movement began, the U.S. was losing lustre. In a December survey by Chinese University of Hong Kong, one-third of the city\u2019s citizens said they\u2019d consider leaving. Among them, the most popular destinations were Canada and Australia, with at least 18 per cent of respondents each, followed by Taiwan, at 11 per cent, and Singapore at 5 per cent. The U.S. was the top choice for 2.9 per cent.\n\nAustralia is a favourite for clients of John Hu, founder and principal consultant at John Hu Migration Consulting in Hong Kong. Advantages include a small time difference with China and mild climate. Canada is also popular, Hu said, especially for clients who want to follow family members who previously emigrated there.\n\nCanada last year recorded its biggest influx of immigrants since 1913. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the country has aggressively wooed immigrants. Its Global Skills Strategy program, for example, offering temporary work permits to applicants in as little as two weeks, has lured about 40,000 workers and their family members over the past two years.\n\nFamily ties make the U.S. attractive. So does the EB-5 investor visa program, which offers residency to anyone able and willing to make a US$500,000 investment in a business or other project that creates jobs. Applications from Hong Kong citizens are processed separately from investors from the mainland, which means that once an application is considered, it can often be approved with little if any wait.\n\nThe price of those visas is about to surge, however. Starting on Nov. 21, the minimum investment rises to US$900,000, part of a reform of the EB-5 program.\n\nEven for those currently in the queue, a bureaucratic backlog means it can take years to get a visa. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has slowed its handling of paperwork to a crawl, making applicants wait years for an answer to their petitions. The department was buried in 930,311 pending cases of all types at the end of June, government data show, double the number of pending cases from 2015.\n\nThe estimated wait for processing investor visas is at least 28.5 months, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. \u201cEB-5 is not likely an answer to people in Hong Kong who say they need a quick exit strategy,\u201d said H. Ronald Klasko of Klasko Immigration Law Partners in Philadelphia. \u201cIt will probably be at least three years before that\u2019s going to get them to the U.S.\u201d\n\nPeople who don\u2019t want to wait often find other ways to enter and stay in the U.S., including student and visitor visas. \u201cDuring these troubles, my clients have been in the U.S. and Canada visiting,\u201d said Carolyn Lee, an immigration attorney based in Ithaca, N.Y.\n\nA less formal immigration status can also overcome another barrier daunting wealthy people who want to move to America: its unique and costly tax rules. For example, new immigrants must disclose all foreign holdings to the Internal Revenue Service, a level of scrutiny that many aren\u2019t prepared for.\n\n\u201cMany of my Hong Kong-based are considering alternatives\u201d to the U.S., said K. Eli Akhavan, a partner at CKR Law in New York. \u201cThe tax bite can be quite heavy.\u201d\n\nHu, the immigration consultant, said American tax rules often take a backseat to quality-of-life issues for families considering the U.S. \u201cHong Kong media\u2019s frequent coverage of school shootings in the U.S. has also made people worry about safety,\u201d he said. Another concern for some, he added, is that \u201cracial discrimination is relatively serious in certain areas.\u201d\n\nStill, the U.S. remains a popular place to do business, educate children, and park money. And even in the most stable times, the global super rich often see spreading assets around the world as an important way to protect their fortunes, said Kathryn von Matthiessen, partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New York.\n\n\u201cMost families I work with are looking to create dynastic wealth,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means they have to manage political volatility and geographic volatility.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "The U.S. has traditionally served as an island of safety and security, particularly for the world's wealthy.
