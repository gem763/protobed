This particular stretch of road was full of bends and it is only a matter of time before someone is killed.\n\nIt was the third time in as many weeks that major roads have been disrupted by the activities of the West Country's Blackmore and Sparkford Vale Hunt\n\nThe latest video, uploaded by hunt monitors from Somerset Wildlife Crime and Hounds Off, shows hounds bounding across the A-road as hunt supporters hold up the traffic for about 15 minutes\n\nTwo weeks ago, MailOnline reported on a video showing cars swerving to avoid hounds as they appeared to chase a fox across a busy stretch of the A352 near Sherbourne, Dorset\n\n'Seconds before the video began, a man on a quad bike had given the sign that a fox had been sighted and this was the response.\n\n'Mark Doggrell is the main huntsman with the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale and he started calling the hounds in the hope that they would pick up the scent.\n\n'This time there were plenty of hunt supporters around to warn the traffic of what was ahead but these hunts treat A-roads as though they are bridleways and the police always seem to turn a blind eye.\n\n'It makes a mockery of the claim that they are simply hunting trails as why would you lay trails across busy roads?'\n\nDespite his best efforts to re-discover the scent, Mr Doggrell fails and the video ends with him stomping through the mud with his pack of hounds at his side.\n\nMr Doggrell, 50, is a well-known figure in the hunting community. Three years ago he was cleared of causing GBH to a hunt saboteur whom he rode into on his horse.\n\nNicola Rawson, then 42, was left with seven broken ribs, a partially collapsed lung and had to be airlifted to hospital following the incident.\n\nHe was cleared after a jury decided he had not intentionally hit her but she later successfully took out a civil claim against him.\n\nThe film begins begins with a huntsman on horseback trotting down the centre of the A3030. Dogs can be seen running down the side of the road as cars begin to pull up in terrible driving conditions. Mr Doggrell then arrives on his horse (right) and starts blowing his horn\n\nHunt monitor Pete White, who shot the footage, said: 'It is just incredibly dangerous to have up to 40 fox hounds tearing across an A-road. This particular stretch of road was full of bends and it is only a matter of time before someone is killed'\n\n'This particular hunt have been really pushing the limits,' said Mr White. 'They have very little respect for anyone else in the community and regard it as their God-given right to go where they please.'\n\nJust two days earlier the same hunt had stopped traffic on the busy A37 road near Lottisham.\n\nThat video begins with three riders trotting down the road after a hound which can be seen running away in the distance.\n\nThe riders make no attempt to speed up after the animal, but five cars and a van are forced to weave around them.\n\nIn the next clip, the road is heavy with traffic, all forced to slow down as the huntsmen perform manoeuvres on the verge.\n\nThe hounds can then be seen in full cry in a field just off the A37. A fox is seen skirting the wood in the field and as the hounds delve into the wood, the fox doubles back and sprints across the field to the 'safety' of the road.\n\nThe clip ends with horns being blown and the hunt continuing as another fox darts up a country lane.\n\nMr Doggrell, 50, declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline at his farmhouse near Sherborne, Dorset. His wife Lucy said: \u2018He\u2019s not going to like this.'\n\nMr White added: 'This time there were plenty of hunt supporters around to warn the traffic of what was ahead but these hunts treat A-roads as though they are bridleways and the police always seem to turn a blind eye'\n\nMr Doggrell, 50, declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline at his farmhouse near Sherborne, Dorset.
