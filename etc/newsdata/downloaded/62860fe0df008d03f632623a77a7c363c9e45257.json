But the similarities largely end there.\n\nGordon D. Sondland, Donald Trump's pick for ambassador to the EU, is a patron of fine-art museums who at one point publicly disavowed Trump's presidential candidacy because of his anti-immigrant and nationalist views.\n\nA long-time establishment Republican, Sondland is also a first-generation American whose parents escaped Nazi Germany. And he is a self-made, multimillionaire hotel magnate from the Pacific Northwest, which is about as European as it gets in America without crossing the Canadian border.\n\nThe contrasts with Trump could prove a major asset if Sondland's nomination is approved, given that the EU is mostly seething at the U.S. president these days over an array of policy disputes \u2014 pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, threatening steel tariffs, and abandoning the Paris climate change accords to name just a few.\n\nIn the last presidential campaign, Sondland had initially been a supporter of Jeb Bush.\n\nEven in their common industry, the sensibilities of the two men could not seem more different. Unlike Trump, whose tastes trend toward gilded and gaudy, and who never owned a building he didn't want to slap his own name on, Sondland's company, Provenance Hotels, is known for refurbishing and reimagining old, historic buildings, and its properties have names like the Sentinel Hotel, the Healthman Hotel, and the Hotel Preston.\n\nSondland and his wife, Katherine Durant, also run a charitable foundation.\n\nSondland's political views on Europe are largely unknown, and like other political appointees with no experience in diplomacy he is likely to face a steep learning curve.\n\nHe will also likely face doubts about whether he has Trump's ear. He is a longtime major donor, and fundraising \"bundler,\" for the Republican Party, who was appointed to the Commission on White House Fellows by President George W. Bush, and served in fundraising roles for Bush, former Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, as well as for the Republican National Committee.\n\nBut he is an ally of Reince Priebus, the ex-chief of staff, who was an early casualty of the chaotic churn in Trump's White House. In the last presidential campaign, Sondland had initially been a supporter of Jeb Bush, and had been named part of the former Florida governor\u2019s Jewish leadership team.\n\nLater, Sondland abruptly withdrew from participating in a major fundraiser for Trump in Seattle in August 2016, and publicly disavowed his candidacy, after Trump feuded with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son, Humayun Khan, was an army captain killed in the Iraq war.\n\nThe president of Provenance Hotels, Bashar Wali, who immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, also withdrew as a host of the Seattle fundraiser.\n\nAt the time, a company spokeswoman explaining the decision had noted Sondland's historic support for Republican candidates. \"However, in light of Mr. Trump's treatment of the Khan family and the fact his constantly evolving positions diverge from their personal beliefs and values on so many levels,\" the spokeswoman said in a statement to local media, \"neither Mr. Sondland or Mr. Wali can support his candidacy.\"\n\nAfter Trump was elected, however, Sondland donated $1 million to his inaugural committee, through four limited liability companies that he controlled. The donations were traced to Sondland by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks the influence of money in U.S. politics. The same spokeswoman then declined to comment when journalists inquired about the donations.\n\nSondland has never worked in government, but he served on the transition team for Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat who held that office from 2003 to 2011. Kulongoski named Sondland to the Governor's Office of Film and Television, which Sondland led for more than a decade.\n\nReached by email, Wali said he expected Sondland to do well in Brussels. \"Gordon is a self-made American success story, and the same skill set that led to his success in business, here at home and internationally, will be crucial when acting as a representative of our country, negotiating on behalf of the U.S. and managing multiple agendas.\"\n\nSurvival story\n\nWhile the nomination to the ambassador's post is undoubtedly a direct result of Sondland's generous financial support, and decades of aggressive fundraising on behalf of the Republican Party, his family history is a European survival story that will resonate in Brussels and across the Continent.\n\nHis parents, G\u00fcnther Sondland and Frieda Piepsch, were born in Germany where they married in 1937, when she was just 16.\n\nSondland told their story in a public interview with the Portland Business Journal.\n\n\"They were both born in Berlin,\" he said. \"They had to escape Nazi Germany. That was the beginning of the uprising of Hitler, and they left Germany in a very, very precarious way. My mother was able to get out of Germany because her father was Russian, and those with a Russian passport could leave. My father was not so fortunate and he had to be smuggled out of Germany.\"\n\nHis mother, then pregnant, ended up in Montevideo, Uruguay, where his sister was born. And it would take another eight years for the couple to be reunited.\n\nSondland's mother recounted the escape story, of his father being hidden in the vegetable bin of a freighter and nearly losing his legs, for an oral history project.\n\nIn telling the family's remarkable journey, she also described how she instilled an entrepreneurial spirit in her son by offering to pay for half of a tape recorder he wanted when he was 12.\n\n\"I said, 'Gordie if you can earn half the money I pay the other half,'\" she told the interviewer. \"So he went, he did lawn work for the neighbors and all sorts of thing and he earned half.\"\n\nSondland met Durant, his wife, in the early 1990s when she was working as a commercial real estate broker and showed him a building that he didn't buy.\n\nAs for his father, Sondland said, \"He wound up in France. And the French took him in. He joined the French Foreign Legion, fought in North Africa and then was put in a concentration camp in Africa, was rescued by the British, and joined the British army. He obviously spoke fluent German so he wound up helping the British army decode German ciphers.\"\n\nAfter being reunited, the couple moved to Seattle in 1953, where Sondland was born four years later. In the interview, he credited international aid workers with helping his parents stay in touch.\n\n\"I have a huge amount of respect for the Red Cross, the International Red Cross,\" he said. \"Because they were the agency actually that facilitated communication between refugees. So they passed letters back and forth, and my mother still to this day has several shoeboxes full of letters between she and my father.\"\n\nSondland met Durant, his wife, in the early 1990s when she was working as a commercial real estate broker and showed him a building that he didn't buy, according to a joint interview the couple gave to Oregon Business. They married in 1993 and have a college-age son and daughter. \"Today we say it was the best deal we\u2019ve ever done that didn\u2019t go through,\u201d said Durant, who goes by Katy and runs their foundation as well as one of their real estate investment firms.\n\nDurant is originally from Oregon and the couple own a home there but Sondland has also maintained a residence in the state of Washington, where he grew up, and which critics assert has been used to avoid Oregon's higher state income taxes. Indeed, the nomination Trump sent to the Senate lists Sondland's home state as Washington.\n\nIn the Portland Business Journal interview, Sondland described his mother as \u201cDr. Ruth\u2019s twin sister\u201d \u2014 with the same short stature and heavy German accent as the American sex therapist Ruth Westheimer \u2014 and said his parents had imparted to him their deep love of fine art.\n\nIn addition to other philanthropic efforts, Sondland and Durant are major benefactors of the Portland Museum of Art, where they endowed a program to allow children under 18 to visit free. Sondland, in the public interview, also talked his own approach as a collector, in which he described himself as far more deliberative than the impulsive president he would represent in Brussels.\n\n\"Any dealer who says 'you have to buy it now or it's going to be gone,' I generally won't do business with,\" he said. \"I try to go back and visit it again because ... art interacts with you differently depending on what mood you are in. And I might be in a manic mood, I might be in a great mood, I might walk in and look at the painting and say, 'I want to buy that,' but then the next day I'll go and look at the same painting and \u2014 what was I thinking? \u2014 it doesn't inspire me.\"\n\n\"So if, after a few visits, I still feel the same about it and Katy and I agree on the piece, then we'll put it in the collection.\"\n\nAs for their tastes, he said, it runs the gamut. \"Figurative. Impressionist. Contemporary. We have glass. We have sculpture. We have a little bit of everything and you react to different mediums differently. And a lot of the works we have no room for in our home, so they are in some of the hotels and they are loaned to museums.\"\n\nHe added, \"We were fortunate enough that we loaned two works to the White House, which hung there for eight years.\"\n\nIf Senate confirmation goes smoothly, he will have a new home of his own to decorate soon enough.", "description": "Gordon Sondland is a wealthy hotel magnate with German roots.", "authors": ["David M.
