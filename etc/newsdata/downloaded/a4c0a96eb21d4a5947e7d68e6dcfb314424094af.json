The two individuals, Eric Mayefsky and Nina Wornhoff, were eventually hired to the campaign.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe emails from Zuckerberg and Chan were first reported on Monday by Bloomberg. The aide to Buttigieg said that the emails were unsolicited and came earlier this year at a time when the campaign was inundated with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from people hoping to work for the fledgling presidential bid.\n\n\u201cTo give you a sense of what the time was like, we literally had people staking out the coffee shop on the first floor of our building wanting to work for our campaign, hoping to run into someone,\u201d the aide said.\n\nMayefsky was hired as senior digital analytics adviser and Wornhoff was hired as organizing data manager.\n\nThe aide also noted that it wasn\u2019t unusual for campaigns to hire staffers recommended to them. Lis Smith, a senior communications adviser for Buttigieg, tweeted on Monday that the campaign has so far gotten staff recommendations from former presidents, members of Congress and one of Buttigieg\u2019s high school teachers.\n\nBen LaBolt, a spokesman for Zuckerberg and Chan, did not immediately respond to The Hill\u2019s request for comment. But according to Bloomberg, the couple made the recommendations after Mayefsky and Wornhoff asked them to connect them with the campaign.\n\n\u201cHaving seen Mark\u2019s visit to South Bend in 2017 and Facebook Live with Mayor Buttigieg, colleagues later asked Mark and Priscilla to connect them with the Buttigieg campaign as they were interested in joining,\u201d LaBolt told Bloomberg in a statement.\n\nLaBolt added that Zuckerberg and Chan \u201chave not decided who to support for President.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg on Monday also made clear that he is not supporting Buttigieg's campaign.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be taken as an endorsement,\" Zuckerberg told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe have several mutual friends from college who introduced me to Pete a number of years ago. When a number of colleagues I had worked with at Facebook or my philanthropic foundation were interested in working [for the Buttigieg campaign], they asked me or wife Priscilla to send over their resume, and so I did that.\"\n\nThe revelation that Zuckerberg actively recommended potential hires for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign came as Zuckerburg and Facebook face scathing criticism from Democrats over the website\u2019s resistance to moderating political ads.\n\nPresidential candidates, including Sen.

His only political donation this year was a $5,000 contribution to Facebook\u2019s PAC, which gives money to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nZuckerberg and Buttigieg both attended Harvard University in the early 2000s and Buttigieg was friends with two of Zuckerberg\u2019s roommates, including Chris Hughes, one of Facebook\u2019s co-founders who has since become a vocal critic of the social media platform.\n\n-- Updated at 1:57 p.m.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan recommended two individuals for staff positions on Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, an aide to the South Bend, Ind., mayor confirmed to The Hill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_041118gn14_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
