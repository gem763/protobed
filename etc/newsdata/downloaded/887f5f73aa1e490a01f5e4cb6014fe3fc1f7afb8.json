I think a no-deal exit is very dangerous. If he comes on Monday and says that, OK.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nHe added: \"The 12th December date is really odd for many reasons.

I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be doing. And I\u2019m going to enjoy it!\"\n\nThe Labour leader said of Boris Johnson: \"This is a very strange Prime Minister running parliament in a very strange way.\"\n\nMeanwhile a meeting of EU27 ambassadors broke up without a decision on a potential delay with plans in place for a further meeting at the start of next week.", "description": "The Labour leader says he wants an election but he fears Boris Johnson could crash the UK out", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20722295.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-25-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
