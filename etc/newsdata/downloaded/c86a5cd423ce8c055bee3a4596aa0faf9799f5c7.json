They try to make it about the actors. And it\u2019s not about me and him,\u201d Snipes told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cFlattery - what do they say? Imitation is the best form of flattery. Yeah. So you know, it\u2019s something that he has acknowledged he wanted to do, and his family wanted him to do it. So I\u2019m appreciative of getting the love. And I\u2019ve created something that others want to carry on, and maybe put their own stamp on it.\u201d\n\nSnipes, who trained in martial arts, is working on a different action-focused project.\n\n\u201cSo we did that (Blade). That\u2019s all great. But we got something else that we going to rock,\u201d Snipes said. \u201cSo all of that stuff that you saw in the \u2018Blade\u2019 franchise, we got something that\u2019s going to come out that I think people will be pleasantly, pleasantly pleased.\u201d\n\nSnipes spoke to The Associated Press while promoting \u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d which opens Oct. 4 . He plays the director and co-star of \u201cDolemite\u201d in the Netflix movie about filmmaker Rudy Ray Moore and his creation of the 1975 Blaxploitation classic. Eddie Murphy portrays Moore.\n\n\u201cAs an artist, I don\u2019t stay in one spot,\u201d Snipes said. \u201cI\u2019m constantly pushing the envelope of my creativity.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The news that another actor was cast as vampire hunter Blade came as a surprise to Wesley Snipes, who portrayed the character in three successful films, but he says he's moving on.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ryan Pearson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/people-wesley_snipes_53342_c0-181-2123-1418_s1770x1032.jpg?9b36df2ee0784b0f8ad27798005ad7822035fcf3", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
