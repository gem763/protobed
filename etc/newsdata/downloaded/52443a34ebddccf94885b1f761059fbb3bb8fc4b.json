Liberal and conservative Trump critics have applauded the CIA operative to legitimize his revelations. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Oct. 6, after a second Ukraine whistleblower came forward, \u201cWe hope others will follow their courageous example.\u201d\n\nBoth demonizing and canonizing whistleblowers are pointless exercises. As a matter of law, a whistleblower\u2019s motivations are irrelevant. People who come forward to expose injustice and abuse of power often have deeply personal reasons: ideological disagreements, personal vendettas, career frustrations. W. Mark Felt, the FBI official who became \u201cDeep Throat,\u201d had recently been passed over for the bureau\u2019s top job. The protections afforded by our laws to people like him don\u2019t discriminate based on intent. A whistleblower\u2019s putative desire for vengeance against his employer or colleagues is no more relevant to the strength of his charges than his putative altruism. Only the facts matter \u2014 in this case the accusations in the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s nine-page complaint, whose validity Congress must weigh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is a danger in our desire to cast whistleblowers in the heroic mold. It imposes unrealistic demands for purity on all aspects of their lives and can deter people who don\u2019t feel particularly pure or heroic from blowing the whistle, according to A.J. Brown, a professor at Griffith University Business School in Australia and an international authority on whistleblowing and public integrity. Australia\u2019s Parliament put it well in a 1994 report: \u201cThe public interest in the exposure and correction of illegal and improper conduct is just as well served by an allegation which proves on investigation to be accurate, but which was made purely out of spite, malice or revenge.\u201d Brown promotes the view of whistleblowing as a \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201ceveryday\u201d kind of heroism, a facet of simply doing one\u2019s job properly.\n\nIn the United States, lawmakers have argued that negative intent can be a crucial tool in uncovering malfeasance. \u201cSetting a rogue to catch a rogue,\u201d wrote Sen. Jacob M. Howard, who authored the False Claims Act during the Civil War, \u201cis the safest and most expeditious way I have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice.\u201d Since its passage in 1863, that statute has become an effective tool to fight corporate fraud, since it enables individuals with evidence of wrongdoing against the federal government to bring suit against corporate offenders or individuals on behalf of the American people, even when the Justice Department decides not to intervene, and to collect a bounty if they win. The False Claims Act has led to the recovery of more than $60 billion in ill-gotten tax dollars and the deterrence of an estimated $1 trillion in further fraud.\n\nWhistleblowers\u2019 sense of outrage, anger or vindictiveness can drive them to make their disclosures. Mary Inman, the London-based head of the international whistleblower practice at the international law firm Constantine Cannon, observes that more than half her clients had been fired before they approached her, and others suffered career setbacks or workplace reprisal for raising concerns internally. \u201cMost whistleblowers make their life-changing decision to act from a complex mixture of raw emotions \u2014 fear, indignation, righteousness, desire for vengeance after having been silenced or maligned,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that they were mistreated can definitely become a tipping point for them, the animus that drives them finally to report the wrongdoing they\u2019ve sat on for a long time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInman says she prefers working with the more pragmatic whistleblowers \u2014 whose range of emotions often includes fear of being swept up in a criminal probe of the wrongdoing they see at work \u2014 over what she calls \u201csoap box\u201d whistleblowers motivated primarily by righteousness, who in her experience rarely feel a sense of justice at the end of a case. \u201cPeople who blow the whistle defensively, or even out of spite for how colleagues have treated them for speaking up, are often intensely practical and realistic people who understand the imperfections of the legal system and make ideal clients.\u201d\n\nSuch motivations can help sustain the years of dogged and draining effort that whistleblowing often requires. In 2002, Allen Jones, an investigator at the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector General in Harrisburg, discovered a massive, multistate fraud scheme run by major pharmaceutical companies. When his superiors pressured him to halt his investigation, citing Big Pharma\u2019s political clout in the state, Jones became an undercover operative in his own office. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018You\u2019re the enemy. And I\u2019m going to prove what you\u2019re doing, when you\u2019re doing it and why it\u2019s wrong,\u2019\u00ad \u201d he told me of his stance toward some of his bosses and colleagues. Jones eventually published his allegations on the Internet and in interviews with major newspapers, and helped the state of Texas win a legal settlement of $158 million against Johnson & Johnson in 2012 \u2014 10 years after he uncovered the scheme. That marked the end of the case and helped make a larger national settlement that the Justice Department and a team of whistleblowers concluded with Johnson & Johnson for $2.2 billion. As one anonymous whistleblower told me of another organization\u2019s attacks on his motives: \u201cThey tried to dismiss me as a disgruntled employee. Which of course I was \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t be disgruntled, after everything I\u2019d seen and suffered at my workplace?\u201d\n\nOne of the most successful and momentous acts of whistleblowing in American history may fit this pattern. Felt was the de facto second-in-command at the FBI when the bureau\u2019s longtime head, J. Edgar Hoover, died. Felt had seemed to be his heir apparent. But President Richard Nixon instead chose L. Patrick Gray to lead the bureau, a major disappointment for Felt, according to reporting by Bob Woodward. Surely Felt was also alarmed by Nixon\u2019s crimes and his attempts to control the FBI, but it\u2019s impossible to discount the likelihood that his frustration impelled him to become Deep Throat, the anonymous source to Washington Post reporters Woodward and Carl Bernstein. That choice helped bring down Nixon and his Watergate co-conspirators. Had Nixon promoted Felt, what might history have looked like?\n\nTwitter: @tommuellerX\n\nAD", "description": "Personal vendettas can be just as powerful a motivator as principled objections.", "authors": ["Tom Mueller", "Tom Mueller Is The Author Of", "Crisis Of Conscience", "Whistleblowing In An Age Of Fraud."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IEEonXTQkccPo9iPDNGAJlXJrgg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KKYY3RVA6MI6JMKGK54DF2X4WQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
