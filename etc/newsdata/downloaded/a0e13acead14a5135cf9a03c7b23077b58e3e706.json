I remember as a kid seeing WWII movies and you'd have some captain or lieutenant or officer of some sort saying, 'OK, we're going over this hill, come on fellas.' If that guy is a pessimist, who's going to go over the hill with him? I think if you equate that to business, it's in many respects somewhat similar.\"\n\nThis year alone, the company has launched the Disney+ streaming service and acquired 21st Century Fox in a $71 billion deal \u2013 its fourth powerhouse acquisition under Iger, along with Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilm.", "description": "Bob Iger believes in looking on the bright side.
