Accenture scored companies on technology adoption, depth of technology adoption and cultural readiness. From there, Accenture segmented companies into leaders, defined as the top 10%, and laggards, which represent the bottom 25%.\n\nSimply put, Accenture's leaders see enterprise technologies as a system compared to independent fixes. Leaders also adopt earlier, reinvest and are more deliberate about purchases.\n\nThe biggest takeaway from Accenture's report revolve around the following:\n\n98% of leaders are adopting artificial intelligence, but only 42% of laggards have.\n\n94% of leaders trust their business data. That trust is a precursor to adopting AI and analytics. 64% of laggards trusted their data to be reliable enough for business change.\n\n95% of leaders have adopted cloud computing and advanced tools such as serverless computing compared to 30% of laggards.\n\n91% of leaders work with cross departmental teams to combine IT and business strategies compared to 41% of laggards.\n\nIn 2018, laggards surrendered 15% in forgone annual revenue and may miss out on 46% in revenue growth by 2023 without enterprise technology change.\n\n90% of leaders ensure data quality compared to 64% of laggards\n\nIT budgets 2020: How the money will be spent, and who will spend it | Research: 2020 IT budgets increase as priorities grow | How to add artificial intelligence to your 2020 IT budget\n\nAccenture explained in its report:\n\nToday's C-suite is making significant investments in new technologies. Yet they are not necessarily achieving full value. They're deploying technologies in pockets, or silos, of their organizations, without a strategy for scaling the innovation from these technologies across the enterprise. Unable to scale their innovation, they're not realizing the full benefits of their technology investments. This is creating what we call the innovation achievement gap\u2014the difference between potential and realized value from technology investments.\n\nUltimately, leaders are looking to meld data, infrastructure, applications, humans and machines in one system. In theory, these systems should be more able to adapt and scale over time.\n\nTechnologies that enable leaders range from big data to cloud to Internet of things to machine learning and artificial intelligence to containers and robotics.
