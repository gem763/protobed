Too often, whenever racism has reared its head in the stands at games, the argument that it is simply a manifestation of a social problem has been used to excuse inaction. Only when racism is absent from society can it be expected to be absent from sports, the logic runs.\n\nThere is some truth in that, of course, but that does not mean sports should sit around and wait. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, said his players have been \u201chardened\u201d to racism because of the issues they face at home, a brave statement for a manager who might have seen an opportunity to take the easy path to the higher ground. There is a bleak truth in that, and yet it did not stop England\u2019s players from doing what they could to make a stand, an example that UEFA might follow.\n\nJust because racism exists in society does not mean, after all, that it should be permitted to exist in the closed environment of soccer. The old idea that the best way to prove the racists wrong is by winning \u2014 as though black players who are abused and lose, simply because they happen to be on weaker teams, are in some way complicit in their own punishment \u2014 has been proven wrong. So, too, has the belief that stopping games is in some way giving the racists what they want.\n\nIt is here that what happened in Sofia offers its second lesson. England\u2019s players were abused in a stadium that was operating at limited capacity because of a similar incident in a previous game, and Bulgaria\u2019s next game is subject to a partial stadium closure for the same reason. UEFA\u2019s paltry fines for racist offenses have long been a laughingstock, despite Ceferin\u2019s protestations to the contrary.", "description": "There is no reason that any player, white or black, should have to go to a country or a stadium with a history of racist abuse.", "authors": ["Rory Smith"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/sports/16onsoccer1/merlin_162709755_7f7127ce-c6d0-485c-8c61-2dae955f3e13-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
