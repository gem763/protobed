Just as important to know: These are Delta basic economy fares, a classification that leaves several things to chance. You\u2019ll be assigned a seat at check-in, for example, and you\u2019ll be stuck in the last boarding group and thus will probably have to gate-check your luggage.\n\nIf you can be fine with those limitations, though, there are some great deals to be had. In most cases, they\u2019re fares that are meant for travel happening sometime between October and February 2020, and the deals include a $97 round-trip offer in basic economy between Atlanta and Nashville; a $99 round-trip offer between Los Angeles and San Diego; a $117 offer between Austin and Cincinnatti; and a $127 offer between Seattle and San Jose.\n\nThe full list of routes and discounted fares offered can be found on Delta\u2019s sale website. Of course, just because a fare that\u2019s discounted here looks pretty low doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t find a comparable offer elsewhere \u2014 one that may also have some of the perks like earlier boarding that you\u2019re denied through this Delta sale. Speaking of those basic economy limitations here, savvy travelers should be able to easily get around them using certain co-branded credit cards that offer perks like early boarding, luggage benefits and the like.\n\nIf you decide these deals are worth it, though, remember \u2014 you\u2019ve only got a few more days to decide, as the fare sale is only good through Wednesday.\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "description": "Regular travelers probably don't associate the idea of sales and low-fares with a carrier like Delta Airlines, which are more in the wheelhouse of a low-cost brand like Southwest that offers up flash fare sales on the regular.Nevertheless, that's exactly what Delta has going at the moment \\", "authors": ["Andy Meek"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a1hSabxpCrM_rcK97p9j_g--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/webp.net-resizeimage-16.jpg?quality=98&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
