According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF), men's breast tissues and cells can \u2014 indeed \u2014 develop cancer, even though they're not milk-producing breasts.\n\nThe NBCF reported that men are less likely to think a lump is cancerous \u2014 and thus, don't get it checked out. The foundation also stated that men rarely get inflammatory breast cancer like many women.\n\nInstead, for the most part, they end up with \"infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\" Accordingly, this happens when duct cells encroach on surrounding tissues in the breast area.\n\nMac was diagnosed in 2012 with breast cancer. He was a FedEx pilot and served 28 years for the Air Force. He couldn\u2019t believe his diagnosis but he wants other men and women to be educated about metastatic breast cancer before it\u2019s too late. @LocalMemphis pic.twitter.com/ZDh2jfKVv4 \u2014 Caitlin McCarthy (@Local24CaitlinM) October 16, 2019\n\nMurray Calloway County Hospital's radiologist, Dr.\n\nAdam Lyles, noted that this particular cancer risk for men is one in 833. However, for women, it's one in eight \u2014 significantly higher. But since there's hardly any awareness regarding men's breast cancer, males typically have a higher mortality rate than women. The doctor mentioned that the yearly diagnoses in men were around 2,400 in 2005. Now, Lyles said that in 2019 2,670 new cancer cases will have been diagnosed in men.\n\nAnd throughout the lifetimes of these cases, 500 men will die. Plus, since a mammogram isn't really on a male's to-do list, the doctor said men's breast cancer is generally detected during its latter stages.\n\nBreast cancer symptoms in men\n\nFor the most part, signs and symptoms are quite similar to those in women. Men could have lumps, swelling, or knots in the chest \u2014 typically around the nipple. The American Cancer Society stated that it's usually painless when occurring.\n\nYet, Dr. Lyles mentioned that the mass could appear in a variety of ways: soft or hard, mobile or fixed. But in most cases, he said it's still around the nipple area.\n\n#Breastcancer is not just a women's disease, men can get it too. In fact, men carry a higher mortality than women because awareness among men is lower and they are less likely to assume that a lump is breast cancer, which can cause a delay in seeking treatment.#Pinktober pic.twitter.com/x6soEDdlf5 \u2014 VPCG (@_vpcg_) October 16, 2019\n\nToo, \"skin dimpling\" or \"puckering\" could happen, as well as the nipple turning inward.\n\nThere could also be discharge from the nipple. The doctor stated that these are signs there could be a mass underneath the area. The cancer society mentioned that men's breast cancer can also spread under the arm and around the collar area, causing a lump or swelling in those regions. This could happen before the breast tumor is actually detectable by touch.\n\nRisk factors in a man's breast\n\nAccording to the radiologist, age is the primary factor.\n\nHe said it's usually found in men over 60 years old. However, family history is also a huge issue \u2014 as well as obesity, alcohol abuse, and liver disease. Yet, another risk factor in men is too much exposure to estrogen. Too, radiation exposure is a key factor, especially in older age. Dr. Lyles mentioned that \u2014 for instance, if men have gotten radiation treatment for \"lymphoma\" or something \u2014 those men's breast cancer risks increase for the future.\n\nMen's breast: Getting checked for cancer\n\nSince men's breast cancer conditions get worse with age, Dr. Lyles mentioned staying on top of it and continually getting checked. He said men should evaluate their chests with just as much attention as their testicles for testicular cancer.\n\nWhat I have learned on this Breast Cancer tour so far is , early detection saves lives . If you feel anything , please see a doctor . 1 in 8 women will get it & 1 in 833 men will get it . The key is catching it early pic.twitter.com/xV9VmlshIM \u2014 Rodney Smith Jr (@iamrodneysmith) October 12, 2019\n\nHe noted that men will get mammograms like women and undergo similar processes \u2014 even possibly an ultrasound. If anything looks suspicious, males could get a biopsy as well. Adam stated that, as long as it hasn't metastasized to the lymph nodes, it's usually a successful detection and treatment.\n\n\"If it is found early, it can be successfully treated just as it is in women, and completely cured most of the time,\" the doctor told Murray Ledger & Times.", "description": "Men's breast cancer is steadily increasing.
