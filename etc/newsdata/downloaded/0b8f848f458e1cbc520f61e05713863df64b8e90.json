And the General Assembly \u2013 known to diplomants as UNGA \u2013 is just one part of the whole.\n\nBut while microstates like Tuvalu and poverty-stricken nations like Sierra Leone and Syria have paid what the organization considers their fair share, America is the only one of the G7 nations that hasn't written a check in 2019.\n\nPresident Donald Trump blasted the United Nations on Wednesday for not collecting dues from 1.3 of its member nations\n\nThe president's grousing omitted the fact that the United States is among the delinquent countries, paying nothing so far this year toward the UN General Assembly\n\nThe UN overall is running a deficit of $230 million.\n\n'So make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States!' Trump groused on Twitter.\n\nUNGA's website reports that '[a]s of 7 October 2019, 129 Member States' out of 193 'have paid their regular budget assessments in full.' The other one-third have not.\n\nA State Department official told DailyMail.com on Wednesday that the U.S. will make its dues payments sometime 'in the fall,' but did not explain the delay. Congress appropriated the money in January.\n\nThe U.S. owes the UN as much as $674 million for the overall regular budget this yead, the U.S. mission to the UN confirmed Wednesday.\n\nSecretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Tuesday that the global organization, based in New York City, is facing a severe cash shortage and 'our work and our reforms are at risk' unless more countries pay up.\n\nTrump has complained in the past that the UN is a wasteful white elephant that sponges off wealthy countries for activities -- like climate change initiatives -- that make the U.S. less competitive.\n\nThe president didn't raise the UN's budget problems when he addressed the General Assembly in September, avoiding charges of hypocrisy\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres spoke to world leaders, including Trump, during General Assembly week in New York City\n\nThe White House succeeded in getting Congress to impose a cap for this year on U.S. funding of UN military peacekeeping operations, down from 27.9 per cent to 25 per cent.\n\nWashington is still $381 million behind in its dues for past years. The State Department official suggested that's a result of the 25 per cent cap.\n\nNot including peacekeeping costs, the organization's budget for 2018-2019 is nearly $5.4 billion. The U.S. will ultimately pay 22 per cent of that.\n\n'Overall the United States, as the largest contributor to the UN, contributes roughly $10 billion annually in assessed and voluntary contributions across the United Nations system,' State siad.\n\nAnd the Trump administration 'has been very clear on its position that no one member state should pay more than one-quarter of the Organization\u2019s budget.'\n\nGeterres said the UN might 'face a default on salaries and payments for goods and services by the end of November' and has already rationed travel budgets.", "description": "The U.S. is the only one of the G7 nations that hasn't paid its dues to the UN General Assembly in 2019.
