The two other parent companies did not respond to emails or phone calls requesting comment.\n\nSoutheast Asia has suffered for years from annual bouts of smoke caused by slash-and-burn clearances of forests for farms and palm oil plantation land, raising worries about public health and the impact on tourism.\n\nThe minister named the subsidiaries as Sime Indo Agro, a unit of Sime Darby Plantation; Sukses Karya Sawit, a unit of IOI Corporation; Rafi Kamajaya Abadi, a unit of TDM Berhad; and Riau-based Adei Plantation and Industry, a unit of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Group.\n\n\u201cThese are the total of foreign firms (whose lands) we have sealed,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\n\u201cHIGH ALERT\u201d\n\nSime Darby said none of the land used by its subsidiary had been closed as a result of fires. \u201cThere has not been any action taken by the Indonesian Authorities to seal off the operations of PT Sime Indo Agro due to fire occurrence,\u201d Sime Darby said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nIOI said its subsidiary Sukses Karya Sawit (SKS) has not received any official notification on its land being sealed off. But it said several small fires had been extinguished in recent months.\n\n\u201cSKS has been on high alert and has put in place measures to deal with the dry weather and the risk of fire. We were able to quickly extinguish several small fires that have occurred over the last couple of months and have assisted other companies and villagers to respond to fires on our neighbouring lands,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nKuala Lumpur Kepong and TDM Berhad, which is owned by the Malaysian state of Terengganu, did not reply to emails or phone calls requesting comment.\n\nSukses Karya Sawit, Rafi Kamajaya Abadi and Adei Plantation and Industry could not be reached for comment.\n\nTeresa Kok, Malaysia\u2019s minister in charge of palm oil, said any report of fires on land controlled by Malaysian companies was a \u201cserious accusation\u201d.\n\nKok said she had contacted the four Malaysian companies and they would cooperate with the authorities to \u201ccorrect this accusation and put matters right quickly\u201d.", "description": "Indonesia's environment minister said on Friday some forest fires in its territory had started on land used by subsidiaries of Malaysian companies, as the two neighbours traded blame for blazes that have spread haze across the region.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429392772&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0R0", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
