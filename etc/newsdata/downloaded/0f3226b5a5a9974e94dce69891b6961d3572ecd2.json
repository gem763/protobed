They also urged for an improvement of pay packages for groundsmen and local coaches.\n\nNo age-level cricket players were included among those seeking the 11-point demands.\n\n\"We did not include under-19 team here as they are preparing for the World Cup. Everybody else is here and we know everybody is with us,\" Bangladesh Test captain Shakib al Hasan said at a press conference on Monday in the capital, Dhaka.\n\n\"We are not going to be involved in cricket unless our demand is fulfilled.\"\n\nMain demands:\n\n\n\n- BPL must go back to franchise model\n\n\n\n- DPL must go back to open market transfers\n\n\n\n- Central contract salary should be higher, and include more players\n\n\n\n- Higher first class match fees\n\n\n\n- Players association to no longer have conflict of interest \u2014 Mohammad Isam (@Isam84) October 21, 2019\n\nHasan said the strike is for domestic and first-class cricket to international cricket.\n\n\"We could not include our women's cricketers because this decision was taken suddenly and if they have any demands they can include it with us,\" Hasan said.\n\nThe planned boycott has thrown Bangladesh's upcoming tour to India, which starts on November 3, in jeopardy.\n\nBangladesh Cricket Board CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury said they would discuss the matter.\n\n\"We have just been informed about the development through media. They [players] are yet to talk on this matter with us directly,\" Chowdhury said.\n\n\"We surely will take a decision on this matter. At this point, I can't say anything on this.\"\n\nBangladesh is currently ranked ninth on the list of 12 Test playing nations.", "description": "Players say they will not take part in any cricket activity unless their 11-point demand list is met by the board.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/be988872a1c44c26909afd2f69efadd3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
