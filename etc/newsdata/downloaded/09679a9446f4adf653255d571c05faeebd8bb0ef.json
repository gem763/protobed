Fear of death is normal. I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t fear death when you\u2019re chasing after convicts. But when you run away from doctor, that means you have to do your own doctoring.\u201d\n\nDOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER SAYS 'BROKEN HEART' LED TO HIS RECENT HOSPITALIZATION\n\nFollowing Chapman's diagnosis, Dr. Oz spoke to the magazine, explaining that the TV personality -- who lost his wife, Beth Chapman, in June after a two-year battle with throat cancer -- was \u201cdenying care that he knew would be life-saving.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Duane] was fearful,\u201d Dr. Oz said. \u201cBeth had been his north star. She was the one that would go with him and keep him balanced so he could deal with these things. Losing her took away his biggest support.\u201d\n\nDOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER SUFFERS HEART EMERGENCY: REPORT\n\nHe continued: \u201cI said, \u2018What would Beth do. What would she say to you? I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be happy with what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re throwing away your life, you\u2019re throwing away your ability to parent your kids. You have to man up.\u2019 That\u2019s what she would say.\u201d\n\nChapman admitted that initially he \"hesitated for a minute\" but eventually agreed to receive care.\n\nDOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER HONORS HIS LATE WIFE BETH IN NEW SHOW: 'SHE'S STILL HERE WITH ME'\n\n\u201cI hesitated for a minute thinking, I don\u2019t want to have to go through this again,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die right now. I\u2019m not afraid to die anymore, but I really didn\u2019t care for awhile if something would happen. I do care now.\u201d\n\nAccording to People, Chapman is now on blood thinners, maintains a healthy diet and is working on kicking his smoking habit.\n\n\u201cOnce this goes away, I am 100 percent,\" Chapman said. \"I\u2019ve had fears. The blood clot is not a normal thing but it happens a lot, but I\u2019m going to be 100 percent. I\u2019m encouraged by it.\"\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Chapmans starred in the A&E show for eight seasons until it was canceled in 2012.
