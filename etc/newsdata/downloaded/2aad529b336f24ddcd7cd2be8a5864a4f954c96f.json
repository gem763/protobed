Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Tuesday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nJordan\u2019s remarks come as Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, was breaking his silence in his first nationally televised interview since his relationship with companies in Ukraine and China came under scrutiny.\n\nIn the interview, Biden maintained he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, but Jordan, the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe American people knew right from the get-go this was wrong,\u201d Jordan told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nHUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON UKRAINE BUSINESS DEALINGS, CLAIMS HE DID 'NOTHING WRONG AT ALL'\n\nJordan went on to say, \u201cThe American people understand fairness, they instinctively get this wasn\u2019t fair, this wasn\u2019t proper, this wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nBiden, 49, told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, \"poor judgment.\"\n\n\u201cI know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,\" he said in an exclusive sitdown with ABC's Amy Robach at his Los Angeles home.\n\n\u201cWe just know this stuff smells,\u201d Jordan said.\n\n\u201cI think the American people, again, they saw this for what it is. They know it smells. They know it\u2019s wrong and that\u2019s the fact.\u201d\n\nPROOF OF LINKS: PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS JOE, HUNTER BIDEN GOLFING WITH UKRAINE GAS EXEC\n\nBiden said he did not discuss the Burisma Holdings board seat with his father, who is currently running for president, except for one \"brief exchange\" that was previously reported.\n\nA photo obtained by Fox News last month showed Joe Biden and Hunter Biden golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter. Joe Biden had told Fox News that he never discussed his son\u2019s foreign business dealings with him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I don't regret being on the board. What I regret is not taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the United States that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea,\" he said, claiming that the allegations of impropriety have been \"debunked by everyone.\"\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Hunter Biden announced he will be stepping down from the board of a Chinese equity fund and that he would not work for any foreign-owned companies if his father becomes president.\n\nFox News\u2019 David Montanaro contributed to this report.", "description": "Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings are something \u201cthe American people knew right from the get-go this was wrong,\u201d Rep.
