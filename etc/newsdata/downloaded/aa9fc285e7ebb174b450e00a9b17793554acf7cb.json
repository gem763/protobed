Defendants sold approximately 2.9 billion digital tokens called \u201cGrams\u201d at discounted prices to 171 initial purchasers worldwide, including more than 1 billion Grams to 39 U.S. purchasers. Telegram promised to deliver the Grams to the initial purchasers upon the launch of its blockchain by no later than October 31, 2019, at which time the purchasers and Telegram will be able to sell billions of Grams into U.S. markets. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to register their offers and sales of Grams, which are securities, in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.\n\n\u201cOur emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \u201cWe allege that the defendants have failed to provide investors with information regarding Grams and Telegram\u2019s business operations, financial condition, risk factors, and management that the securities laws require.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token,\u201d Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \u201cTelegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, charges both defendants with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and seeks certain emergency relief, as well as permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation is being conducted by Daphna A. Waxman, Morgan B. Ward Doran, and John O. Enright of the SEC\u2019s Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Carolyn Welshhans, Acting Chief of the SEC\u2019s Cyber Unit and Lara Shalov Mehraban, Associate Regional Director of the New York Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s litigation will be led by Jorge G. Tenreiro and Kevin McGrath.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
