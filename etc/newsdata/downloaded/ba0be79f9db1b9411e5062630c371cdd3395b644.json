Despite wearing a large black coat and being partially concealed by a rock, her stomach appears flat.\n\nOddly, she was not mentioned among names of North Korean leadership accompanying Kim on the visit.\n\nInstead, reports mention the name of Kim's sister - Kim Yo-jong, who appears to have been filling in for Ri on official engagements since the June summit.\n\nShe was among those accompanying Kim on his recent horseback ride at Mount Paekdu, and was shown separately from Ri on the Kumgang trip.\n\nThe last time Ri was seen in public was at a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in June. Until then, she had appeared in state media roughly once a month, making the absence significant\n\nRumours had swirled that Ri's absence meant she was pregnant. She is already thought to have three children with Kim, though none have been acknowledged by the North Korean state\n\nDuring his visit to Kumgang, Kim ordered the demolition of 'unpleasant-looking' South Korean facilities at the jointly-build resort, saying they looked like 'temporary buildings at construction sites.'\n\nLittle has been confirmed about the private life of Kim Jong-un, whose own existence was not acknowledged by North Korean state media until 2010, when it is thought he was already 27 years old.\n\nSouth Korean intelligence sources have said Kim likely married Ri in 2009, as he was preparing himself for rule, and could have up to three children aged between one and eight years old.\n\nBasketball player Dennis Rodman, who struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim around 2013, claims to have held one of Kim's children - a daughter named Ju-ae.\n\n'He's a good dad and has a beautiful family,' Rodman said at the time.\n\nNothing is known about the genders of the other two children, and it is not clear if Kim has a male heir.", "description": "Ri Sol-ju was seen alongside husband Kim Jong-un during his visit to the Mount Kumgang resort this week, marking the first time she has been seen in public in more than four months.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/07/20118136-0-image-a-2_1571900020874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
