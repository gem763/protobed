By keeping impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump under wraps, they are controlling the messaging and what the public knows. What\u2019s out there doesn\u2019t look great, but we should see it for ourselves.\n\nPolitics shouldn't get in the way of transparency. It's too important.\n\nThis is only the fourth time in U.S. history that a president has faced a formal impeachment inquiry, so there\u2019s not a lot of precedent.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., speaks at a news conference in front of House Republicans after Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper arrived for a closed door meeting to testify as part of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Prior to official impeachment probes into former presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, the full House took a vote. That\u2019s not happened here, and members should be given the opportunity to go on the record with a vote.\n\nIn this case, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry late last month \u2014 before she or other members of Congress had seen the full whistleblower report, or the transcript of the July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president that sparked the saga.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-California, has happily complied. Other committees are involved, but Schiff is running the show, selectively leaking juicy tidbits while keeping everything else secret.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.

Lee Zeldin, was present for Taylor\u2019s testimony, and tweeted the following: \u201cThis transcript should be released ASAP along w ALL of the other transcripts. Much of his leaked opening statement collapsed, but Schiff keeps the public in the dark on that!\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, and other disgruntled Republicans are becoming more vocal in their opposition to the process and the lack of transparency. Scalise has spearheaded a House resolution that would open the process to all members, including access to depositions and interviews.\n\nSimilarly, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, on Thursday introduced a resolution chastising the Democratic-controlled House for its \u201cclosed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThis is not the time for political games. If the accusations against the president are credible, let the American people hear them and make their own judgments.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2019/10/27/editorial-shine-more-light-impeachment/2454663001/", "description": "If the accusations against the president are credible, let the people hear them and make their own judgments.", "authors": ["The Detroit News", "Published P.M.
