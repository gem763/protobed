It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nBut speaking with reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump was asked whether he had asked any foreign leaders for corruption investigations of people who were not seeking to challenge him in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cYou know, we would have to look,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nThe House of Representatives has embarked on an impeachment inquiry against Trump stemming from the president\u2019s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In that call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, a request that led members of the administration to contact a CIA agent who ended up filing a formal whistleblower complaint.\n\nOn Thursday, the president reiterated his call for Ukraine to investigate Biden. He also called on China to do the same.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, talks with reporters in the Capitol after a vote on Sept. 12.

During a June 18 phone call, Trump brought up the standing of Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the presidential race, CNN reported Thursday. While the record of that call was stored in the same highly secure electronic system that houses the full record of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, Trump is also reported to have told Xi that he would remain silent on protests in Hong Kong while trade negotiations continued with the U.S.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House appears poised to impeach Trump on the contents of the call as outlined in a partial summary released by the White House as well as the whistleblower complaint. Whatever articles of impeachment are approved would then head to the Senate, where no Republicans aside from Romney have publicly voiced disapproval of the president\u2019s requests for foreign investigations of Biden.\n\nThe Utah senator also broke ranks with his party in September, when the story of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky was first reported.\n\nRomney has had a hot-and-cold relationship with Trump. In April, he became one of the first Republican members of Congress to criticize Trump following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the president\u2019s ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election and his attempts to obscure them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019\n\nIn order for Trump to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Senate would need to vote to convict him.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Republican Sen.
