But that\u2019s just the cold, hard facts about the World Cup... We all understand that.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old Hansen has not confirmed his post-World Cup plans, but New Zealand media reported earlier this year he was moving to a director of rugby role with a Japanese club.\n\nHansen, who is already regarded as one of New Zealand\u2019s greatest rugby coaches and could cement his legacy by guiding the team to a third successive World Cup title, has refused even to think about what it might mean if his side lose on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll affect me when it\u2019s finished. You haven\u2019t got any room to get gaga emotional. You\u2019re here to do a job,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cThe team is bigger than the individual, always has been, always will be.\n\n\u201cThe jersey and legacy of the jersey demands you to be there giving 100% of what you have. So you don\u2019t have time to think about yourself. You\u2019re thinking about the job you\u2019ve got to do.\n\n\u201cWhen the tournament is over, that\u2019s when you step back and have a reflection and think about what\u2019s next and what life will be like. But at the moment, it\u2019s not even in your mind.\u201d\n\nFollowing Hansen will be a hard task and his current understudy Ian Foster has already indicated his willingness to step into the spotlight in 2020.\n\nSchmidt was also touted as a potential successor to Hansen but said he was not planning on coaching at all in 2020 in order to spend more time with his family.\n\nHe barely touched on the ramifications of an Ireland loss on Saturday, and instead preferred to focus on the good relationship he had with his fellow New Zealanders.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re good guys to have a drink with afterwards,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really enjoy the rivalry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone not to have respect for what the All Blacks have achieved.\n\n\u201cAs a coach, coming from New Zealand, seeing those guys at the top of the tree, it\u2019s pretty awesome to be in the mix coaching against them.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to catching up and then we\u2019ll both sit nervously in the coaches\u2019 boxes and hope that our teams can get the result on the day.\u201d", "description": "All Blacks coach Steve Hansen was not prepared to think about it and Ireland's Joe Schmidt did not address it, yet Saturday's World Cup quarter-final between their sides will mark an end of an era for one of the head coaches.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442049686&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G27X", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
