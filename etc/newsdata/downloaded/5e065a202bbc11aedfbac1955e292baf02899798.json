Do you think the House of Representatives should impeach President Trump?\"\n\nWeek 1: 45.2% of those polled said they \"support\" or \"strongly support\" impeachment, and opposition, and 29.8% said they \"oppose\" or \"strongly oppose\" impeachment.\n\nWeek 2: 47.1% of those polled said they \"support\" or \"strongly support\" impeachment, and 29.2% said they \"oppose\" or \"strongly oppose\" impeachment.\n\nWeek 3: 46.6% of those polled said they \"support\" or \"strongly support\" impeachment, and 29.5% said they \"oppose\" or \"strongly oppose\" impeachment.\n\nInsider has also polled Americans about the investigation itself, asking \"Do you believe launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump for soliciting foreign interference in a US election is the right thing to do?\"\n\nWeek 1: 52.1% of those polled said \"definitely yes\" or \"probably yes,\" and 32.6% said \"definitely not\" or \"probably not.\"\n\nWeek 2: 54.7% of those polled said \"definitely yes\" or \"probably yes,\" and 33.5% said \"definitely not\" or \"probably not.\"\n\nWeek 3: 52% of those polled said \"definitely yes\" or \"probably yes,\" and 35% said \"definitely not\" or \"probably not.\"\n\nA consistent plurality support impeachment, but neither side has secured new support from the undecided\n\nThe relative consistency of the numbers suggest that neither supporters of impeachment, nor opponents, have won over a significant contingent of the public to their side. In addition to the answers above, each week, nearly a quarter of respondents have indicated that they either \"don't know\" or \"neither support nor oppose\" impeachment.\n\nNonetheless, there is potential for public opinion to shift as familiarity with the investigation rises. Our polling has suggested that knowledge of the Ukraine scandal that led to the impeachment inquiry has increased \u2014 and among respondents who are familiar with the situation, strong support of impeachment has bumped up, and strong opposition to impeachment has decreased.\n\nPartisanship has veered sharply\n\nBroken down by party, the results are considerably less steady. More than 70% of respondents who self-identify as Democratic voters have said they support impeachment, and more than 64% of those who self-identify as Republican voters oppose it week by week.\n\nBut those numbers fluctuated drastically two weeks after the announcement of the impeachment inquiry. As more revelations quickly emerged, Democrats moved strongly in favor of impeachment proceedings, and Republicans became more adverse to them. When Insider polled on October 4th and 5th, 82% of Democrats said they support impeaching Trump \u2014 a jump of nine percentage points. In the same vein, Republican voters saw a sharp 11-point increase in opposition to impeachment, from 64% opposed to 75%.\n\nFor comparison, among independents \u2014 characterized as respondents who said they don't plan to vote in a major party's primary or caucus, or don't know \u2014 support for impeachment has hovered around 35% each week, while opposition has stayed around 20%.\n\nIn Insider's latest poll, both Democrats' and Republicans' sentiments have returned to week one numbers, indicating that partisanship on the matter is fickle and changes quickly with the news. Still, the topic remains divisive \u2014 and the question of whether either side can win over a higher share of the American citizenry remains.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Trump, explained in 60 seconds\n\nTrump's presidency is disintegrating as he faces his worst 30 days since taking office\n\nAs the impeachment probe intensifies, 40% of Americans say they think Mike Pence would make a better president than Trump\n\nGenerally speaking, digital polling tends to skew toward people with access to the internet.
