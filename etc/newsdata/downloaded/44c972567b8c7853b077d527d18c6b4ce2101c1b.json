Trump had complained for several days that forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contradicted his Sept. 1 Alabama tweet, the officials said.\n\nMulvaney then called Ross, who was traveling in Greece, and told him that the agency needed to fix things immediately, the officials said. Mulvaney did not instruct Ross to threaten any firings or offer punitive actions. But Ross then called NOAA acting administrator Neil Jacobs, the officials said. That led to an unusual, unsigned statement from NOAA released on Sept. 6 that backed Trump\u2019s false claim about Alabama and admonished the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham, Ala., division for speaking \u201cin absolute terms\u201d that there would not be \u201cany\u201d impacts from Dorian in the state. The Weather Service is an arm of NOAA, which is an agency within the Commerce Department. The New York Times first reported some elements of the White House involvement.\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian near peak intensity. (NOAA/RAMMB)\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he did not direct NOAA to issue such a statement. \u201cNo, I never did that,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did that. It\u2019s a hoax by the media. That\u2019s just fake news.\u201d\n\nBut the apparent political pressure on a group of scientists who are supposed to be independent led House Democrats on Tuesday to launch an investigation into the Commerce Department\u2019s involvement in NOAA\u2019s unusual decision to side with Trump over its scientists.\n\nRep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), chairwoman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), chairwoman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, sent a letter to Ross requesting information related to the department\u2019s dealings with NOAA and Dorian.\n\nThe Science Committee, which has jurisdiction over NOAA, is requesting a briefing with Commerce Department staff who may have been involved in issuing instructions to NOAA that led to several directives being sent to Weather Service staff and culminated in the Sept. 6 unsigned statement.\n\n[NOAA leader, in Alabama speech, says \u2018weather shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue\u2019]\n\nThe imbroglio began Sept. 1, when Trump tweeted that a number of states, including Alabama, were at risk from Dorian. Trump falsely asserted that the state would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by the powerful hurricane. A short time later, the Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office tweeted: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from # Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane # Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nJacobs has since said that the forecasters were not aware of the Trump tweet and were responding to a flood of calls from concerned residents.\n\n[NOAA\u2019s chief scientist will investigate why agency backed Trump over its experts on Dorian, email shows]\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disturbed by the politicization of NOAA\u2019s weather forecast activities for the purpose of supporting incorrect statements by the president,\u201d Johnson and Sherrill wrote to Ross. The House members want to know who ordered and helped draft the Sept. 6 statement and whether Commerce Department or White House staff members were involved in threatening NOAA leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to supporting the activities of the NWS and its dedicated staff. During your Senate confirmation hearing, you committed to allowing federal scientists to \u2018be free to communicate data clearly and concisely\u2019 and that you would \u2018not interfere with the release of factual scientific data,\u2019 \u201d Johnson and Sherrill wrote.\n\n\n\nForecast track for Hurricane Dorian issued at 5 AM ET on Sept. 1. (NOAA)\n\nThey noted that based on news reports, it appears that Ross violated the \u201cvalues of scientific integrity.\u201d\n\nThe Science Committee is requesting all records of communication among Commerce Department officials, NOAA and the White House between Sept. 1 and Sept. 9 pertaining to the president\u2019s tweet and NOAA\u2019s Sept. 6 statement.\n\nThe committee also wants to hear from three Commerce officials in particular by Sept. 30: NOAA deputy chief of staff Julie Kay Roberts, Commerce chief of staff Michael Walsh Jr. and Commerce policy director Earl Comstock.\n\nAt the time Trump sent the Sept. 1 tweet, the only hurricane forecast product that was showing potential impact in Alabama noted the probability of seeing tropical-storm-force winds, and even that showed about a 5 percent chance of such conditions in a small portion of the state. The official track forecast at the time of his tweet showed the storm moving up the southeastern coast, away from Alabama.\n\nBut between Sept. 1 and the statement of Sept. 6, Trump issued several more tweets trying to justify his original statement.\n\nRep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), who serves on the Science Committee and chairs a subcommittee on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for Ross to resign and for an investigation into whether Ross and other political appointees violated NOAA\u2019s scientific integrity policy.\n\nCommerce Department probes\n\nIn addition to the Science Committee\u2019s investigation, others are initiating probes into NOAA\u2019s decision to back Trump\u2019s claim. These include the Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general and NOAA\u2019s acting chief scientist.\n\nA spokesman for the Weather Service confirmed Tuesday that the Commerce Department inspector general had launched a probe. The spokesman said two senior leaders had received notice of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, NOAA acting chief scientist Craig McLean wrote an email Sunday, saying he would open an investigation into whether the agency\u2019s Sept. 6 statement, as well as previous emails to Weather Service staff, violated the agency\u2019s scientific integrity policy.\n\n\u201cThe content of this news release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey lifesaving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products, that specific danger arises.\u201d\n\nAs a result, McLean told his staff that \u201cI am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\"\n\n\u201cI have a responsibility to pursue these truths,\u201d he added. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nThe scientific integrity policy includes a provision that states, \u201cIn no circumstance may any NOAA official ask or direct Federal scientists or other NOAA employees to suppress or alter scientific findings.\u201d\n\nThese investigations are taking shape as outside groups call for inquiries and circulate letters of support for Weather Service scientists.\n\nJane Lubchenco, head of NOAA under President Barack Obama; Richard W. Spinrad, NOAA\u2019s chief scientist under Obama; and Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, filed a joint request for NOAA to initiate an investigation into possible violations of its scientific integrity policy, Lubchenco wrote in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, a new tropical weather system is brewing, and this one may actually hit Alabama.", "description": "Lawmakers, Commerce Department launch investigations into NOAA\u2019s decision to back Trump over forecasters.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hgyQLAjV5vVo0PkD4LyHbUWUM58=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-09-2019/t_865bed3a586b4dfbb01d45f5c404dd39_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_05_24_20_Still018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
