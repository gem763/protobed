Lee wandered backyard\n\nThe courtyard is behind the home (pictured), complete with tailored shrubbery, a plethora of leafy plants and trees to liven up the brick patio space where residents can bask in the beautiful weather\n\nThe front door, which has not changed in the 244 years since it was first installed, is surrounded by pure white molding that encapsulates residents when they step into 607 Oronoco Street address from a brick driveway\n\nWashington Fine Properties describes it as: 'A newly-functional home in an antique and beautiful envelope.'\n\nIn true Virginia fashion the home is shrouded in history.\n\nPresident George Washington dined at the property, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, the French military officer from the Revolutionary War who visited in 1824.\n\nThese side-by-side pictures shows just how little the formal dining room has changed over the several decades since Robert E. Lee sat in the room for dinner, but the patterned wallpaper has been switched for an olive green\n\nRobert E. Lee lived in the multistory home from age of five in 1812 until he left for the United States Military Academy in 1825.\n\nFound at 607 Oronoco St, Alexandria, VA, 22314, the home is a national landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe dwelling has exquisite high ceilings and includes multiple seating areas to entertain guests.\n\nMark and Ann Kington of Alexandria, Virginia, renovated the kitchen space, equipping it with stunning marble counter tops, beige colored cabinets and impeccable glass pantry space, after buying the home in 2000 from the Lee-Jackson Foundation for $2.5 million\n\nInterested buyers can imagine themselves leaning up against the gray marble counter top, coupled with faux-brick wall tiling, beige cabinets and stainless steel appliances\n\nThe core interior has been left untouched, boasting glistening hardwood floors, an original fire place and high ceilings that make the home feel airy\n\nA spacious dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows lets residents bathe in sunlight as they walk through the home.\n\nThe kitchen has been updated with an center island and glass-front cabinets.\n\nThe master suite features a sitting area and a fireplace perfect for chilly northeaster winters.\n\nA look inside the one of the home's sitting rooms shows how the Lee family's minimalist style with wooden chairs and a thin couch, has transformed to provide new resident's optimal comfort with plushy chairs and windows to let in sunlight\n\nThis room, an successful example of tasteful pattern mixing among the carpet, rug and flowery window drapes, is perfect for those residents looking for a private, peaceful place to unwind in the Alexandria home or get some work finished at the dark wood desk\n\nA master bath includes dual vanities and a stand-alone tub.\n\nThe home also has an office, drawing room, a family room and a recreational room.\n\nThe land surrounding the home is a stunning garden space with patios made for relaxing.\n\nThe property contains a detached studio and a two-door garage.\n\nSurrounding the dark stone fireplace is yellow patterned wallpaper that contrasts with the tan carpet cover mounting the stairs alongside a dark wood banister\n\nThe Kingston couple decided to play around with the dark wood accent pieces, swapping the wooden floor and stair tread for a patterned carpet that spans the entire room\n\nWhen residents walk up winding staircase, passing framed works of art and an open window situated between the bottom and top stories, they will discover the top of the Lee's old home where the master bedroom and bathroom can be found\n\nThere's also a spacious recreational room with beautiful, floor-to-ceiling cabinets that wrap around the entire carpeted space and frame the white brick colored television stand that previously held a fire place\n\nBefore it was a television stand, the dark brick fire place was surrounded by pure white molding that possessed a detailed trim along the top\n\nLee's childhood home, while filled with maternal love, marked a rough patch during the Lee family's life.\n\nAccording to PBS, the family moved into the property after Robert's father, Henry Lee, landed in debt prison because of bad investments.\n\nPlaced side-by-side in photos, it's clear the updates have maintained the Lee family's original vision but wth the additional of carpeted floors, flowery drapes and twin beds\n\nWith his father away and older brother attending Harvard University, Robert was forced to take care of his 'invalid' mother and sickly sister.\n\nTwo centuries after the Lee's moved there, Mark and Ann Kington bought the property from the nonprofit group Lee-Jackson Foundation for $2.5 million in 2000.\n\nFrom the age of five, Robert E. Lee most likely spent his days playing in his home's luscious backyard with his older brother, when he was home from Harvard University, and his younger sister, when she was not bedridden with illness\n\nIn a completely modern addition, the home has been furnished with an detached studio (pictured) and a two-door garage that appears to have been built with red brick, black doors and\n\nA site map of the property shows the true extent of the space, including two peaceful terraces, a patio facing the main road, a gracious lawn space to throw parties a two car garage, and a main residence all shrouded among tall trees\n\nPreviously, the home was used as a museum, but the charity was were no longer able to afford its upkeep.\n\nThe Kington family overhauled the home during a three-year renovation that fixed up the kitchen, bathrooms and added a new roof.\n\nThe windows were rebuilt or replaced and, most impressively, they removed 43 layers of paint.\n\nMark Kington told the Alexandria Times: 'It didn\u2019t look like [it does now]. The walls looked like they hadn\u2019t been painted in 30 years.'\n\n'It was gloomy and gray, but as we walked through, you could tell that this was a significant house and, architecturally, that\u2019s a lot of what we were drawn to.'\n\nThey lived in the home for 18 years before attempting to sell the house last year.", "description": "Confederate General Robert E.
