It was the lowest rate since China started reporting data by quarters in 1993.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed to a 26-year low in the latest quarter amid a tariff war with Washington, adding to deepening slump that is weighing on global growth.\n\n\u25c6 Global Repercussions\n\nThe slowdown in China, the world's biggest trader, has global repercussions. It is depressing demand for industrial components from Asian countries and prices of soybeans, iron ore and other commodities, hitting Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund cited the U.S.-Chinese tariff war as a factor in this week's decision to cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 percent from its previous outlook of 3.2 percent.\n\nTrump agreed last week to delay a tariff hike on Chinese goods and said Beijing promised to buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods. Officials say the two sides still are working out details.\n\nBeijing has yet to confirm the scale of possible purchases of U.S. goods. It is unclear whether Chinese leaders want more steps including possibly lifting punitive tariffs already in place before purchases go ahead.\n\n\u25c6 Cooling Domestic Activity\n\nAn even bigger impact on Chinese growth appears to come from cooling domestic activity including consumer spending and investment. Retail sales growth declined to 8.2 percent over a year earlier in the first three quarters of 2019, down from the first half's 8. percent, the National Bureau of Statistics reported.\n\nChinese leaders are in a marathon campaign to nurture growth based on domestic consumption and reduce reliance on trade and investment. But those plans call for maintaining the level of exports that support millions of jobs.\n\nFactory output growth slowed to 5.6 percent in the January-September period, down from 6 percent in the first six months of the year. China's exports to the United States, its biggest foreign market, fell 21.9 percent in September from a year ago. That helped to drag down overall Chinese exports by 1.4 percent. Imports of American goods sank 15.7 percent.\n\nThe latest economic growth figure was the lowest since China began reporting data by quarters in 1993. Annual growth tumbled to 3.9 percent in 1990 but rebounded to 9.3 percent the following year.", "description": "China's Quarterly Economic Growth Slows to 26-Year Low", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/19/2019101900341_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
