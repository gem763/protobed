(Photo: Sarah Bergeron)\n\nNothing says romance during Halloween like an adorable couples\u2019 costume, such as Peter Pan and Wendy or Popeye and Olive Oil \u2014 or a murderous clown demon and their victim.\n\nWhile Pennywise from \u201cIt,\u201d the movie adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s chilling classic, doesn't necessarily inspire romance to most, one horror-loving couple in Oklahoma felt appearing as the terrifying dancing clown and one of his young victims would be the perfect way to ring in the Halloween season.\n\nMaci Ann Tate, who created the uncanny enlarged forehead, red wig, and shoes through a lot of \"trial and error,\" started to design her Pennywise costume in January to attend horror conventions with her boyfriend, Jonathan Krell.\n\nMaci Ann Tate dressed as Pennywise from 'It.' (Photo: Sarah Bergeron) More\n\n\"The idea for the photo shoot, in particular, came from how long I have been putting this [costume] together. I figured I\u2019ve invested so much time and money into the costume and practicing [the makeup, I] might as well make lasting memories from it,\" Tate tells Yahoo Lifestyle. She says Krell is \"definitely my match. We are both into the same things, and convincing him to play the role [of Georgie] didn\u2019t take much.\"\n\nMaci Ann Tate and her boyfriend, Jonathan Krell, dressed as Pennywise and Georgie from 'It.' (Photo: Sarah Bergeron) More\n\nTate turned to her friend, Sarah Bergeron, to help her document her vision.\n\n\"I picked Pennywise as he seemed to be the most challenging of costumes to do and looks as theatrical as possible,\" Tate says, adding that applying her makeup took over two hours.\n\n\"I was blown away when we met at her house before the shoot,\" shares Bergeron, who tells Yahoo Lifestyle that this was her first photo shoot besides the ones with her child. Bergeron added that when she arrived at Tate\u2019s home on the day of the shoot, her friend ran out to her car and completely terrified her with the final look.\n\nWhile frightening her friend was one thing, Tate did take precautions as to not scare any passersby.\n\n\"I contacted The Village, the small suburb of Oklahoma City that I live in, on their non-emergency line, along with citizens on the suburb's Facebook page,\" Tate says. \"[I asked] them to not call the police.\"", "description": "A couple in Oklahoma dressed up as Pennywise and Georgie in an epic \"It\"-themed photoshoot.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Hb18XwOvHJysR.IqbJJ02w--~B/aD0yNzMwO3c9NDA5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/451897a0-f12e-11e9-bf77-19f140c826e1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
