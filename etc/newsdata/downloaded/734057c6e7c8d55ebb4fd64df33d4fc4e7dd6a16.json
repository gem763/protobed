We proved we\u2019d be out the country, but the judge wasn\u2019t interested in adjourning it.'\n\nThe I'm A Celeb star - who failed to turn up to court because she was abroad -reasoned her ability to drive is vital due to her location, her 17-year-old son Harvey's needs and her terminally ill mother Amy.\n\n'I need to drive and I am going to appeal', she said.

Last month, she revealed she was selling her garish \u00a375,000 pink Range Rover and Fiat Ducato horsebox 'because they get her into trouble'.\n\nHer lawyers wrote to the court to try and adjourn the hearing because she was out of the country.\n\nBut District Judge Robert Hunter refused any further delays, telling Bexley Magistrates' Court: 'This hearing has already been adjourned once. This date was agreed by both sides.

The media personality has been banned from driving a number of times in the past.\n\nSome of her previous convictions - including a disqualification from January 2018, driving while disqualified last July, and six points for an offence she was convicted of in January this year, were read to the court.\n\nIn 2012, she was disqualified for a year after failing to respond to two speeding tickets. Last February, Katie was banned for six months after failing to tell police who was driving when her car was caught breaking a 50mph speed limit near her home.\n\nShe was banned because she already had six points on her licence and was handed a further six by a court.\n\nThe Eurovision star was also banned for three months in January after being caught driving while disqualified and without insurance last summer.\n\nAnd in February earlier this year, she was banned for three months for being almost twice the legal limit while in charge of her pink Range Rover last October.\n\nNo-show: Katie did not attend the hearing on October 10 at Bexley Magistrates Court, claiming she was only due to return to Gatwick Airport in the morning (pictured in February)\n\nShe was found slumped in the back of the 4x4 after police saw it hit a grass verge minutes before in Shooter's Hill, Greenwich, South East London.\n\nThe former Loose Women panellist recently refuted claims that she will be forced to give up her home as she is due back in court over bankruptcy repayments.\n\nShe avoided bankruptcy last December after reaching an agreement over a \u00a322,000 tax bill.", "description": "The former glamour model, 41, has branded her two-year driving ban 'b*******' and 'obscene', just days after she was charged.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo", "Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/01/19717786-0-image-a-102_1571100387763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
