The Democrat said leaders are doing a whip count and asking members how they would vote.\n\nThe House is already investigating Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s family. But the White House and Republicans have dismissed the probe as \u201cillegitimate\u201d because there has been no formal House vote to open impeachment proceedings. Trump\u2019s allies are challenging Democrats who may be politically reluctant to put their names formally behind impeachment.\n\nMany first-term Democrats from swing districts have recently come out in favor of Trump\u2019s impeachment over the Ukraine call.\n\n\u2014By Laurie Kellman\n\n__\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is acknowledging he earned $500,000 for work for a company run by a business associate who has been charged with federal campaign finance violations.\n\nGiuliani says he received two payments totaling $500,000 related to the work for Lev Parnas\u2019 company, Fraud Guarantee, which is based in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nGiuliani says he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee\u2019s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues, and that he is confident the money came from a \u201cdomestic source.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also is playing down the $500,000 total, saying he\u2019s had larger contracts with other clients.\n\nParnas and an associate were arrested last week trying to board an international flight. The charges against them relate to a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nThe men had key roles in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe payments were first reported by Reuters.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nA former White House adviser on Russia has told House impeachment investigators that she had strongly and repeatedly objected to the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nA person familiar with Monday\u2019s behind-closed-doors testimony of Fiona Hill described her testimony to The Associated Press.\n\nYovanovitch herself testified last week that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to fire her.\n\nHill testified for more than 10 hours Monday in the Democratic inquiry. At issue are Trump\u2019s pleas to Ukrainian officials for investigations into political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and into the country\u2019s involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFive more private interviews are scheduled this week, mostly with State Department officials, though it\u2019s unclear if all will appear after Trump declared he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the probe.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump and the House impeachment inquiry (all times local): 2:43 p.m. House Democratic leaders are gauging", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/35884a_nancy-pelosi-washington-90973-nancy-pelosi-suzan-delbene-speaker-house-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
