Many good, innocent, people lost their lives and were injured yesterday.\u201d\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said at a press conference Sunday that Davis texted him saying, \u201cThank you all for praying. This is all of our worst nightmare, but thank God she\u2019s alive and relatively well.\u201d\n\nDavis said Anderson\u2019s \u201cmouth is pretty bad,\u201d but that it doesn\u2019t seem like her jaw was affected. Abbott, reading from the text, said Anderson will undergo surgery on Monday to remove shrapnel from her chest and to fix her bottom lip and mouth.\n\nAs part of her text to the governor, Davis said: \u201cToddlers are funny, because they can get shot but still want to run around and play.\u201d\n\n\u201cToddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play,\u201d reads a text message from the mother of the 17-month-old who was shot yesterday that is being relayed to the media by Gov.

We are thankful for our beautiful baby girl and look forward to reuniting her at home with her twin brother soon.\u201d\n\nPolice believe the 36-year-old shooting suspect acted alone when he led police on a chase across the city while firing at people in several areas with an AR-style weapon. Law enforcement shot and killed him in the parking lot of a movie theater in Odessa.\n\nOdessa\u2019s police chief refused to name the 36-year-old shooting suspect at the same Sunday conference Abbott appeared at, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot gonna give him any notoriety for what he did.\u201d\n\nThe 17-month-old\u2019s story inspired many people, including actress and activist Alyssa Milano, to donate to a GoFundMe to help the baby\u2019s family. The fundraiser\u2019s creator, Haylee Wilkerson, says she is a friend of the family, and the GoFundMe raised more than $160,000 as of Sunday evening.\n\nThis is Anderson Davis. She is 17 months. She was shot by a gun in #OdessaShooting.\n\n\n\nShe has shrapnel in her right chest.\n\n\n\nShe has a hole through her bottom lip and tongue.\n\n\n\nHer front teeth were knocked out.\n\n\n\nHere is how to help her: https://t.co/ZEYnbIlAo5 #NoRA pic.twitter.com/XE1lkf5diH \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) September 1, 2019", "description": "The mother of Anderson Davis, who was wounded in Saturday's mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, said the 17-month-old is expected to fully recover.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c5aac2500007e0400df5d.jpeg?cache=k0kzx2tfww&ops=1778_1000"}
