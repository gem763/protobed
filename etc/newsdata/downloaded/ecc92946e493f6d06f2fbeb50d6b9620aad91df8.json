But Mr Disler said taking into account sales costs associated with the sales, the net result was a 5.3 per cent discount compared to URF's book value.\n\n\"These are normal selling costs for this market,\" he said.\n\nThe pair said it would take more than two years to sell 36 properties earmarked in their efforts to reduce debt.\n\nOne of the properties sold during the quarter was 72 Glen Avenue in West Orange. The six-bedroom mansion was bought for $US1 million at a Sheriff's Auction in August 2017, but was disposed of for $US875,000, incurring $US50,000 in costs.\n\nEarlier this month, former chief executive Alan Dixon's temporary departure was made permanent.\n\nThe fund said it would save almost $3 million in annual costs after shedding 50 staff, moving to smaller offices and adding credit card charges to rent payments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther costs would be saved by internalising maintenance and repairs and cutting back landscaping arrangements at its properties.\n\nSources said the US office had recently cut weekly \"happy hours\" and quarterly staff events.\n\nMost of the URF's investors are clients of wealth management firm Dixon Advisory, which has been at the centre of a controversy after steering clients into the investment along with other in-house products.\n\nAs the unit price has plunged, more investors questioned the decision to allocate large portions of their investment portfolios towards the URF shares, notes and preference shares.\n\nClass action law firms have taken an interest in developments and are in contact with clients of the firm.\n\nThe Evans Dixon Group was formed by the merger of Evans & Partners and Dixon Advisory and listed in 2018.", "description": "The $1.4 billion URF portfolio is being sold off to repay debt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9619%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_704%2C$y_47/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1697df8c2b630d4c8cfd4cb5320fdfaf020368d4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
