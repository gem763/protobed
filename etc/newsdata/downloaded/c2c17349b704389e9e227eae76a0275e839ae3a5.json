This is the only part of the withdrawal agreement that has been renegotiated, though there have also been changes to the accompanying non-binding political declaration.\n\nAlso, 11 pages of annexes relating to the original Irish backstop have been removed.\n\nEverything that has been removed from May's protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland Everything that is new in Johnson's protocol\n\nAll the other sections remain the same as in the original withdrawal agreement that was rejected by parliament three times under Theresa May\u2019s premiership. This includes 20 pages on the UK\u2019s future contributions to the EU budget and 19 pages on rights and obligations.\n\nThe new withdrawal agreement includes a fresh solution to the Irish border question, replacing the backstop with a commitment that Northern Ireland will retain substantial regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.\n\nEven so, much of the 15 pages on the new Ireland/Northern Ireland protocol is lifted directly from the agreement brokered by May and her team.\n\nThe most significant changes were new sections on the customs territory of the UK and the movement of goods. A notable removal was a section committing the EU and UK to \u201cendeavour\u201d to conclude a new agreement by 31 December 2020.\n\nThis, then, is the revised deal that parliament will be asked to approve on Saturday. For Johnson to pass his deal, he needs to win over some of the 70-plus MPs who we think are undecided.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Guardian analysis shows less than 5% of the original deal has been renegotiated.
