Picture taken January 30, 2010. (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo )\n\nFormer vice president and current Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden defended his son Hunter\u2019s Ukrainian business dealings during an interview with 60 Minutes that aired Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never discussed my business or their business, my sons\u2019 or daughter\u2019s,\u201d Biden said after being questioned by CBS\u2019s Norah O\u2019Donnell. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that\u2019s it and they have to make their own judgments.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Hunter] was already on the board. And he\u2019s a grown man. And it turns out he did not do a single thing wrong, as everybody\u2019s investigated,\u201d he added when asked why he didn\u2019t counsel his son against joining the board.\n\nBiden\u2019s defense comes after his son admitted during an interview with ABC earlier this month that \u201cit was poor judgement\u201d to serve on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was vice president and overseeing diplomatic measures in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d Hunter Biden said in the ABC interview. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has continually stressed that the Bidens acted in a corrupt manner in Ukraine, and asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the matter during a now-infamous July 25 call that has become the impetus for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nReports this past month suggested that Burisma hired Biden as a \u201ca helpful non-executive director with a powerful name\u201d in the midst of corruption investigations, and paid him and his business partner Devon Archer $80,000 per month.\n\nDuring the 60 Minutes interview, Joe Biden challenged President Trump to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how straight you are, okay old buddy? I put out 21 years of mine. So show us your tax returns, bud. What are you hiding? You wanna deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release your tax returns or shut up,\u201d Biden said.", "description": "Biden\u2019s son recently admitted \u201cit was poor judgement\u201d to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was overseeing diplomatic measures.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Matthew Continetti", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Rich Lowry", "Ben Shapiro", "Dan Mclaughlin", "Kevin D.
