She now has a window to either expand her appeal to millions of voters who are uncertain about her candidacy, or make sure they write her off.\n\nIt all comes down to health care.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator portrays herself as the candidate of dreaming big and fighting hard. That is working well when it comes to her signature promise of fixing what she calls a rigged economic system that favors rich people and corporations at the expense of much of the rest of America.\n\nFinancial struggles and insecurity are problems that know no party, after all. And polls show 6 in 10 believe that wealthy people aren't paying their fair share. The same large majority favors raising their income taxes or (as Warren has proposed) imposing a wealth tax. An even larger 69% say corporations aren't paying enough.\n\nWarren's support for \"Medicare for All\" and the phaseout of almost all private insurance, however, is working much less well. In fact, it\u2019s scaring people off.\n\nPeople want choices on health care\n\nWarren won predictable applause at the last Democratic debate when she declared, \u201cI've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d They like their doctors, nurses and pharmacists, she said, and they\u2019d be able to keep them \u2014 the only difference would be the bill would go to the government, not an insurance company.\n\nThat tremendously oversimplifies an intensely personal, complicated issue.\n\nA few months ago, a friend told me over dinner that he liked his health insurance and would oppose any plan or candidate that forced him to give it up. That came as an utter shock, but then I considered the sources of our respective plans. He has excellent insurance through a top university. I have expensive, skimpy insurance in an industry that has fallen on hard times.\n\nElizabeth Warren at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry on Sept. 21, 2019, in Des Moines, Iowa. More\n\nThere are lots of people with marginal insurance or no coverage at all. But there are also lots of people like my friend. That has become increasingly clear as unions, a core Democratic constituency, defend the private health insurance plans they have negotiated, sometimes giving up higher wages in exchange.\n\nPolling reflects this reluctance to throw out the existing patchwork of private insurance and public plans like Medicare and Medicaid. Most people prefer to build on the current system, the premise of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), rather than move to Medicare-only. Seven in 10 like the idea of giving everyone a choice between private insurance or a public, government-run option (like Medicare, for instance). Even a majority of Democrats favor that approach over Medicare for All.\n\nMedicare for All as 'goal' to fight for\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who all oppose eliminating private insurance companies, make arguments tailored to those numbers. Buttigieg at the debate framed Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan as \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d versus trust and choice, as in Buttigieg's proposal for Medicare for all who want it: \u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them.\u201d\n\nWarren's health plan is headlined \u201cHealth care is a basic human right\u201d and says that while we must defend the ACA from damage, \u201cit\u2019s time for the next step.\u201d That step is Medicare for All, \"a goal worth fighting for.\" There are no specifics about costs, transitions, structure or timing. There are, however, details on other ways Warren is trying to improve health care.\n\nShe has introduced bills to make drugs more affordable, expand mental health coverage and help communities fight the opioid epidemic. She has several proposals to ensure that rural areas have the health care facilities and workforce they need. And while she co-sponsored Sanders' Medicare for All bill, she has also co-sponsored a State Public Option Act to let states sell Medicaid plans to anyone, regardless of income.", "description": "Warren is not as all or nothing as her health care rhetoric suggests.
