Brexit narrowly passed; Trump, while losing the popular vote, still legitimately won the U.S. presidency. Both countries were deeply and rather evenly divided over both epochal events, and the bitterness and polarization has only deepened since.\n\nBut how epochal have they actually been? Three years later, Brexit remains elusively over the horizon, somehow slipping further from view the closer you get to it. Trump, still in his first term, somehow survived the Mueller Report, including clear evidence of obstruction of justice, but has failed to shift immigration policy legislatively, build the wall, win a trade war, or get growth above 3 percent, even with massive unaffordable tax cuts. Yes, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh \u2014 but only after ending the judicial filibuster, and then with a profoundly polarizing nomination, in Kavanaugh. And, yes, judges in general. But any GOP president would have nominated the same crew.\n\nIn some ways, then, both 2016 turning points have been on hold since. Brexit may still never happen; Trump, as this week\u2019s huge news shows, may not even be able to run for president in 2020. Or Brexit could happen in a month\u2019s time, and Trump could get reelected handily. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat we do know is that both 2016 shifts are now entering a critical phase. Brexit, already postponed, is now scheduled for October 31, which the prime minister and the E.U. say is the absolute deadline, even as Parliament is insisting that it be extended once again. Boris Johnson\u2019s government no longer has a majority at all, keeps losing votes in the Commons (this week a majority actually refused to allow a brief recess, as is routine, for the Tory Party Conference), and is begging to be put out of its misery by an election. Meantime, the opposition refuses to vote for an election until Johnson betrays his electoral promise and postpones Brexit again. Which he won\u2019t. Because Leave voters would abandon him and empower the Brexit party. And so deadlock. But also tick-tock.\n\nIn the U.S., the Congress has effectively long stopped legislating, and the president has almost nothing on his agenda that has any realistic chance of becoming law, including the NAFTA update. And now, of course, we have discovered devastating evidence that Trump has indeed been colluding with a foreign government to intervene on his behalf in the next election, but this time as a sitting president and with Ukraine, not Russia. The revelation has prompted an impeachment inquiry that will force the Senate GOP, at some point, finally to choose if they back the president or the rule of law. It\u2019s crunch time.\n\nAnd so the tension mounts. The strategies of both Johnson and Trump are very similar: Keep demonizing the elites as trying to nullify the results of the referendum and the last presidential election, play hardball with opponents, rally the right, and push constitutional restraints until they are at risk of breaking altogether. So far, it\u2019s worked, but both Johnson and Trump are showing the strain. Trump\u2019s approval numbers are in the low 40s. Johnson\u2019s are in the upper 30s.\n\nBoris, it now seems, was too hardball when he expelled 21 Conservative dissidents from the party earlier this month; his rhetoric, especially when he refused in the Commons even to sympathize with those MPs facing death threats, has been increasingly indecent; his speech at the U.N. this week was surreal and a little loopy, and another little scandal with yet another paramour hasn\u2019t helped. He has a potentially winning hand \u2014 if the election were held now, he\u2019d be a favorite to prevail. But he\u2019s playing with a little too much fire to be so unafraid of getting burnt. He could still be a transformative prime minister of a post-Brexit U.K.; but it\u2019s just as possible he\u2019ll be responsible for the destruction of the Tory Party, the collapse of the British economy, and the end of the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd Trump is melting down. This is a relative term, of course. He\u2019s been mentally unstable and clearly addled for a long time. But this week, he seemed drained to me, dazed, depressed, delusional. His swift concessions to the Democrats \u2014 allowing a semi-transcript of his chat with Zelensky to be published, even though it was damning, and then releasing the whistle-blower complaint, even though that clearly makes matters much, much worse, and implicating his own attorney general and vice-president in a conspiracy \u2014 were signs of panic. Was this a strategy to appear innocent, with nothing to hide? If so, \u201cdelusional\u201d doesn\u2019t quite capture it, does it?\n\nBut I bet Trump does not even understand the high crime he committed \u2014 leveraging national-security policy to get a foreign government to smear a political opponent. Trump admires mafiosi, and always has. He has done his best to emulate them his entire life. Why would he not continue to do so? And a narcissist of Trump\u2019s proportions is simply unable to act in the interest of something other than himself, or see his personal interests as different than or subordinate to his public duties. So his psyche is stopping him from seeing what a big deal this is, while his eyes and ears see potential catastrophe. This will not end well. And it didn\u2019t help that Rudy Giuliani kept popping up on cable news, like a whirling dervish in a skull mask, digging his client into a deeper and deeper political grave.\n\nYesterday, Trump\u2019s manic tweeting was close to clinical evidence of a narcissist\u2019s decompensating and dangerous rage. While his own acting director of national intelligence vouched for the whistle-blower\u2019s integrity and adherence to protocol \u2014 \u201cHe did the right thing\u201d \u2014 Trump was lashing out, demonizing the potential witness, accusing him of partisanship and an alliance with spies around the president. Paranoid much?\n\nListen to him ramble on about the \u201ctranscript\u201d of the Zelensky call in a private meeting with Republicans: \u201cIt was perfect. I could not have said or had a better conversation.\u201d A few minutes of incoherent raging and reminiscing later: \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person that gave the whistle-blower the information, because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right?\u201d So someone should be executed for relaying a \u201cperfect\u201d conversation. The man is unwell.\n\nThe president\u2019s only defense is that what he did was perfectly legal and appropriate, which has made watching Fox News this week so fascinating. Arguing that a president can legally collude with a foreign leader to influence an American election is one step up from their response to the Mueller Report, which was that it was obviously wrong but didn\u2019t happen. More to the point, they are making this argument because they have no place else to go. No wonder a prominent Republican senator told Gabe Sherman: \u201cThis could unwind very fast, and I mean in days.\u201d\n\nWhere will this end? The extortion is so obvious, and the cover-up so crude \u2014 they just stuck that particular tape into a top-secret drawer for some inexplicable reason \u2014 that it is easily comprehended by the general public. We\u2019ll see how the polling shakes out, but the early signs do not seem good for Trump to me. Every poll has a plurality supporting impeachment, or a tie. Rasmussen even found 11 percent of Republicans believing that Trump committed treason.\n\nMaybe another shoe will drop that Trump can exploit. Maybe the Democrats will screw it up again. Maybe Hillary Clinton can save Trump\u2019s hide (she\u2019s doing a media blitz next week). This is the beginning of an unpredictable process \u2014 but my gut this week tells me it\u2019s more Nixon than Clinton. To allow a president who has brazenly abused his public office to continue in that office is to invite far worse abuses. Look what lesson Trump took from the Mueller Report! He made the Zelensky call the day after Mueller testified. Can you imagine what he would be willing to do if he got away with this again? Tyranny is dynamic, not linear. The one thing we know is that we have a president who has committed almost the definition of an impeachable offense (bribery, treason), and keeps upping the ante. That\u2019s a huge risk to take, even for Republicans.\n\nAnd so we\u2019re moving suddenly \u2014 and sooner than I expected \u2014 to a moment of truth. It can\u2019t be postponed in either country for much longer. No resolution will be unifying, I suspect, for either country. If Trump and Brexit go down, we should be worried about a more radicalized and potent far right. If Trump or Brexit prevail, the elites will not take it lightly. So strap in \u2014 this is it. In so many ways, that\u2019s a relief.\n\nThe Pathos of Greta\n\nThe case of Greta Thunberg is a fascinating one. Some argue that she is being used; that children should not be spearheading political movements; and that her Asperger syndrome is propelling her fixation on the climate crisis. Others see her as a brilliant and charismatic truth-teller, a Joan of Arc for the climate crisis. A new memoir by her family in the voice of her mother, not yet translated into English, tells a story of a remarkable young woman with a great deal of anxiety. Paulina Neuding, Quillette\u2019s European editor, explains the background to Greta\u2019s current passion:\n\nGreta is eleven years old and has gone two months without eating. Her heart rate and blood pressure show clear signs of starvation. She has stopped speaking to anyone but her parents and younger sister, Beata. After years of depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks, she finally receives a medical diagnosis: Asperger\u2019s syndrome, high-functioning autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism \u2014 which explains why she sometimes can\u2019t speak to anyone outside her closest family. When she wants to tell a climate researcher that she plans a school strike on behalf of the environment, she speaks through her father.\n\nThunberg, mercifully, attends a school for children with special needs, and seems to have channeled her acute fear and panic to good ends. Her mother \u201cstresses that her daughter has never felt better than during her campaign for the climate. Greta herself has said that realizing that she could do something about climate change has helped her recover.\u201d The question is whether what Greta describes as her own personal \u201cfear and panic\u201d should be the basis for a global campaign for radical change to protect the climate. And there are aspects in the book that make one worry about her parents\u2019 influence. Neuding notes: \u201cThe book posits that oppression of women, minorities, and people with disabilities stem from the same overarching root problem as climate change: an unsustainable way of life.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know Swedish, but I have no reason to doubt Neuding\u2019s reading. And I don\u2019t think the climate crisis is integrally related to any other social phenomenon than the merciless wheels of capitalism and wealth creation, which have improved the lives of countless millions over the past couple of decades, but devastated the planet at the same time. But watching Thunberg this week, and absorbing the intensity of conviction she brings to arguably the most urgent crisis humanity faces, I didn\u2019t care about these picked nits. I found her spell-binding, her rage utterly justified, her fear genuine and rational.\n\nWhat if it takes a 16-year-old with Asperger\u2019s to address this subject with the urgency and seriousness it deserves? There\u2019s a striking clarity and brilliance to some people on the spectrum of autism. Unintimidated by social cues, they can blurt out the truth. This past week, we got yet another report from the world\u2019s scientists that the pace of change is accelerating, especially in the oceans, that a great mass extinction is already well underway. I\u2019m sorry but the excuses for inaction have now gone far beyond legitimate skepticism toward grotesque collective irresponsibility in the face of a huge problem that will plague every human being who comes after us. The face of disgust and loathing that Greta directed toward president Trump when their paths nearly crossed at the U.N. this week was more than justified.\n\nI get her anger; her speech at the U.N. rang completely true to me; the generational injustice is massive. There is no evidence that she is being coerced into this. In fact, her autism-related capacity to focus obsessively on what is in front of her nose is better than the denial, forgetting, and apathy of the rest of us. There is suffering in this. You can see it in her eyes. But there is suffering behind anyone truly, implacably dedicated to changing the world. And the suffering she is trying to halt \u2014 of future generations of humans, and of animals and plants over which we humans have dominion \u2014 is on a different scale entirely.\n\nYes, she deserves some privacy, some space to take care of herself, and I hope she has the support to do that. Yes, she is young. Yes, her crusade has touches of masochism and self-sacrifice. But rather than criticize a teenager for leading this fight, or her family for supporting her, we might do well to ask ourselves why those far older than she have done so little for so long. And seem to suffer nothing.\n\nThe Value of Fathers\n\nLast Friday, on Real Time With Bill Maher, in a debate with Heather McGhee, I cited a statistic for how many African-American babies are born to an unmarried mother: \u201cWhen 70% of African-American kids are born without a father or two parents, they aren\u2019t supported \u2026 There is a real problem in African-American society about bringing up kids \u2026 It\u2019s much more acute in that community.\u201d I was referring to a statistic about kids born to unmarried mothers: The latest CDC data show a 69 percent rate of births to unmarried mothers among African-Americans, including mothers who live with their children\u2019s father. The equivalent data for other groups are 52 percent for Hispanics, 28 percent for whites, and 12 percent for Asian-Americans. The average for everyone is 40 percent. Here\u2019s another data set for children under 18 living in single-parent homes, or homes where their unmarried parents cohabit, based on the Census and the American Community Survey: 65 percent for African-Americans; 41 percent for Hispanics; 24 percent for whites; 15 percent for Asian-American kids.\n\nMcGhee implied that I was impugning the parenting of African-Americans, in the manner of Joe Biden\u2019s remark in the last Democratic debate about the government intervening to help poor African-Americans to bring their kids up right. Tour\u00e9 also wrote a piece making a similar case, rejecting what he called \u201cthese mythological notions that the Black father isn\u2019t at home and isn\u2019t doing his job \u2026 It denigrates the character of Black men, supposing they\u2019re not contributing to the well-being of their families.\u201d He considered my worry about single motherhood as \u201cone of the core tenets of racist thought.\u201d\n\nAllow me to say I am not judging the parenting skills of anyone else, let alone black men. I have no qualifications to judge anything of the kind. I\u2019m just worried, as both Biden and Barack Obama have expressed, that this pattern of family structure gives black kids an objective disadvantage in life. The social science is unanimous: \u201cChildren who grow up with only one of their biological parents (nearly always the mother) are disadvantaged across a broad array of outcomes \u2026 they are twice as likely to drop out of high school, 2.5 times as likely to become teen mothers, and 1.4 times as likely to be idle \u2014 out of school and out of work \u2014 as children who grow up with both parents.\u201d\n\nThis applies across all races, and increasingly among poor whites, whose family structures today are undergoing the same collapse that African-American families have already gone through. (As recently as 1960, only 22 percent of black kids were living without two married parents in the home.) Family is not the only factor, of course. The legacy of racism uniquely hurts black kids; relative poverty also explains a lot. But growing up in a stable household with two married parents makes a huge difference for future success, whatever your race and class, and that difference appears to be widening as time goes by.\n\nBoth McGee and Tour\u00e9 cite another CDC study, and it contains important nuances. I\u2019m grateful for their pointing it out. It notes that black fathers who live in the same house as their kids tend to be more dedicated than fathers from other racial groups. For example: \u201cA larger percentage of black fathers (41%) had helped their coresidential children with homework every day in the last 4 weeks compared with Hispanic (29%) or white (28%) fathers.\u201d Or this: \u201cBlack fathers (70%) [who lived with their kids] were most likely to have bathed, dressed, diapered, or helped their children use the toilet every day compared with white (60%) and Hispanic fathers (45%).\u201d\n\nBlack fathers who do not live with their kids are also more involved than other groups of absent fathers: \u201cA higher percentage of Hispanic fathers aged 15\u201344 (52%) had not played with their noncoresidential children in the last 4 weeks compared with white (30%) and black (25%) fathers.\u201d\n\nBut the core of the report is about the big difference between fathers of all races who live in the same house as their kids, and fathers who live apart. It\u2019s understandably a very big difference. So, for example, 65 percent of fathers who lived with their kids talked to them about their day in the last four weeks; only 16 percent of fathers who lived apart did the same. Of those fathers with kids in the home, 81 percent had played with their kids in the last four weeks; of those fathers who did not live in the same home, it was 10 percent. Or take reading to your kids: Of fathers in the same home as their kids, 29 percent read to them in the previous month, while only 5 percent of those living elsewhere did. This difference unsurprisingly far outweighs any racial gaps.\n\nAnd a key statistic in this study is that 24 percent of black fathers live apart from their kids, compared to 18 percent for Hispanics and 8 percent for whites. Tour\u00e9 and McGhee are right to stress that, in this study, a majority of black dads do live with their kids. But it\u2019s also true that proportionally fewer do than any other racial group, and that most of the cohabiting fathers do not have the extra commitment of marriage.\n\nI had no intention of disparaging black fatherhood, and I apologize if that was the inference. But it is wrong to think that, on average, black kids are getting the same benefits from growing up in a stable family as their peers in other demographics. We know that matters for future flourishing.\n\nSee you next Friday.", "description": "The year 2016 was a watershed in Anglo-American politics.
