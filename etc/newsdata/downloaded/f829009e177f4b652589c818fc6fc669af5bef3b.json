You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2015 and I will,\u201d the letter begins.\n\nTrump urges Erdogan to negotiate with Kurdish forces, then concludes by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nThe letter was written the same day that the Turkish military launched an offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria after Trump\u2019s Oct. 6 order for U.S. troops to withdraw from the region \u2015 a decision that was met with bipartisan condemnation and that leaves the lives of U.S.-allied Kurds in jeopardy and risks the re-emergence of ISIS.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s letter was first reported by Fox Business, many Twitter users presumed it to be satire or a hoax, and White House journalists felt the need to clarify when tweeting it that it was, in fact, real:\n\nFelt the need to ask WH if this is actually real and it is. pic.twitter.com/bHyIFw6cvO \u2014 Katie Rogers (@katierogers) October 16, 2019\n\n.@theOnion might as well shut down, because it can\u2019t do better than this. https://t.co/U3OMKEfAbh \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 16, 2019\n\nWH confirms this letter is real: https://t.co/Y8ZOScDIsi \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 16, 2019\n\n1. This is embarrassing beyond words.\n\n2. It suggests the President is mentally unstable.\n\n3. No competent staff would have let this thing leave the building.\n\n4. Imagine the letters we *haven't* seen. https://t.co/xs28pY53fI \u2014 Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) October 16, 2019\n\nI am a historian of US foreign policy. I have read many, many letters from US Presidents to foreign leaders, and I have never read a letter from the US President so unhinged, so threatening, so bizarre, so completely lacking in basic etiquette. Trump is deeply, deeply unwell. https://t.co/XOOo2689sI \u2014 Brad Simpson (@bradleyrsimpson) October 16, 2019\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront,\u201d David Gergen, who has been an adviser to several presidents, said the letter \u201chad such an adolescent quality to it\u201d that when he first saw it, he assumed it was fake.\n\n\u201cWhen I read it, I immediately called my research assistant and said, \u2018See if this is fake. I just can\u2019t believe the White House sent this out,\u2019\u201d Gergen said.\n\n\u201cIt is unprecedented to the best of my knowledge, and I do think it makes it tougher to work with Turkey, which is a member of NATO, and we need to figure out a way to get this stopped short of much more violence.\u201d\n\nFormer presidential adviser David Gergen says President Trump's letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"had such an adolescent quality to it,\" adding, \"I can't believe the White House sent this out. Because it is unprecedented.\" https://t.co/VJF0jVn3lb pic.twitter.com/yrGG1hQkHf \u2014 OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) October 17, 2019\n\nThe president was said to have handed around copies of the letter in a meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday, and copies were also reportedly handed out on the Senate floor.\n\nIt appears the president believed the letter had been something to be proud of, and multiple reports cited a Democratic aide from the meeting who said Trump opened the meeting by boasting about his \u201cnasty\u201d letter to Erdogan.\n\nTrump opened his meeting with leaders by boasting of his \"nasty\" letter to Erdogan, per Dem aide familiar with meeting. Aide says that at one point Trump suggested there were communists in Syria and Democrats would like that. \"I hate ISIS more than you do,\" Trump told Pelosi. \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) October 16, 2019\n\nPer the same source, Trump handed out copies of the letter he'd sent to Erdogan at today's meeting in what was interpreted as an attempt to show everyone how tough he'd been. \u2014 Jill Colvin (@colvinj) October 16, 2019\n\nSenators were passing around a printed copy of Trump's Erdogan letter on the Senate floor, per source who witnessed the scene. \u2014 Burgess Everett (@burgessev) October 16, 2019\n\nThe best/worst part is Trump probably leaked his Erdogan letter to Fox News thinking it made him look strong and smart. \u2014 Wajahat \"Tough Guy\" Ali (@WajahatAli) October 16, 2019\n\nTwitter users had a field day with the correspondence, creating dramatic readings and re-enactments:\n\nHonestly this letter from Trump to Erdogan would make more sense if it were written in crayon on lined practice paper rather than on White House letterhead pic.twitter.com/YN97BuXgqk \u2014 Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) October 16, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s letter to Erdogan bears uncanny resemblance to this letter my daughter wrote to my son (when she was six). pic.twitter.com/J2G741UzVQ \u2014 Elie Honig (@eliehonig) October 17, 2019\n\nI present to you all, Trump's crazy letter as the Star Wars crawl pic.twitter.com/0ayBvJIz1F \u2014 Eric Koch (@EricDKoch) October 16, 2019\n\nI staged a dramatic reading of Trump\u2019s letter to Erdogan.\n\n\n\nThe part of Erdogan is played by my cat - Ow, Fuck. pic.twitter.com/cbTvskZFWu \u2014 Myke Cole (@MykeCole) October 16, 2019", "description": "The president wrote a letter to the Turkish leader telling him not to invade Syria, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy.
