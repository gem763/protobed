Widely criticised for his handling of corruption cases, Mr Shokin was eventually voted out of office.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump envoy 'warned Giuliani that Biden corruption claim not credible'\n\nThe ad goes on to criticise another common Trump target, accusing \"media lap dogs\" of aiding Democrats' impeachment efforts. It depicts prominent journalists bashed by Mr Trump: CNN hosts Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, White House correspondent Jim Acosta and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\nCNN said in a statement that \"in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\"\n\nMr Murtaugh maintained that the Biden ad is accurate and was \"reviewed by counsel.\"\n\nAnother 30-second video titled \"Coup\" and released on Wednesday has been rejected as well, CNN said on Thursday.\n\n\"Coup\" decries Democrats' impeachment efforts as an attempt to \"undo the election regardless of facts\" and attack Mr Trump \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nIt also accuses representative Adam Schiff, D-Calif, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of fabricating evidence during a discussion of a whistleblower complaint against Mr Trump, a claim also broadcast from the president's Twitter account (Mr Schiff has said his paraphrase of Mr Trump's controversial call with Ukraine's president \"was meant to be at least part in parody\").\n\nThe impeachment push is \"nothing short of a coup and it must be stopped,\" the Trump ad declares.\n\nCNN cited similar concerns about false statements in declining that newer commercial, saying the spot makes claims about the whistleblower complaint against the president that the intelligence community inspector general has debunked.\n\n\"In addition, it is inaccurate to use the word 'coup' to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process,\" the company stated, echoing critics who slammed Mr Trump's comparison of impeachment to an opposition group's violent, illegal overthrow of a government.", "description": "CNN will not run two Donald Trump campaign ads because they make \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims while discussing impeachment, the television channel said on Thursday.The network added that the adverts disparage its journalists and push unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against former vice president", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/issbkwXz8DiAu9_I0UP41Q--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b3ae9465c80f9ee0c3318bfa4921fa89", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
