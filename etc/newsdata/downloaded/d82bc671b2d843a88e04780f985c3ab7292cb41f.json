If she can repeat that at next year\u2019s Olympics, it would be a feat no female gymnast has managed at a single Games.\n\nBut for Biles, it\u2019s not about the statistics.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be more thrilled with the performance that I put out at this world championships,\u201d she said. The medal record? \u201cI\u2019m not a number person.\u201d\n\nIt's not about the number of medals for Simone Biles; it's about the performance.

And to be second is super crazy,\u201d the 16-year-old U.S. gymnast Sunisa Lee said after taking silver behind Biles in Sunday\u2019s floor exercise. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she\u2019s been doing this for so long.\u201d\n\nBiles\u2019 24th medal came on the beam, breaking a tie for 23 with Belarusian gymnast Vitaly Scherbo.\n\nBiles scored 15.066 after a near-flawless routine, opting for a simpler dismount than the double-double she performed earlier in the championships.\n\nThat dismount is a sore point for Biles, who introduced the double-double to competition this season and had the skill officially named after her at the worlds \u2014 there are four Biles skills now. She feels the International Gymnastics Federation didn\u2019t reward it with a high enough difficulty rating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth the one-tenth (extra difficulty point). I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just not,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen her score was announced, guaranteeing the medal record, Biles leaped up from her seat with a broad smile and punched the air.\n\n\u201cI was really excited. I thought it was going to be at least a 14.8, 14.9, but to see 15, I was like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s pretty crazy,\u2019 so I was very proud,\u201d she said.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise by a full point, scoring 15.133, despite a step out of bounds on one pass, and blew kisses to the audience after finishing her routine.\n\nBiles hasn\u2019t confirmed whether she\u2019ll continue to compete after next year\u2019s Olympics, so this week may have been her last at the world championships. Blowing kisses to the crowd wasn\u2019t meant as a goodbye to the competition, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a good floor routine, farewell to just the end of this world championship chapter here in Stuttgart,\u201d she said.", "description": "It may be her last round, as the star hasn't confirmed whether she will continue competing after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/simonebilesap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
