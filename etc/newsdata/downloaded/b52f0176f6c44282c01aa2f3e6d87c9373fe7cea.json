On top of that, lay the lamb shoulder, onion quarters and rosemary and pour in the red wine, lamb stock and Worcestershire sauce. Season with some salt and black pepper. Cover with tin foil.\n\nRoast for 8 hours.\n\nRemove the lamb from the oven, take the meat out of the roasting pan and set aside to cool for a moment.\n\nIn the meantime, pour the gorgeous juices from the roasting pan into a saucepan to get it reducing on the stovetop. Add 250\u2013500 ml (1\u20132 cups) water.\n\nLet the juices bubble away for about 20 minutes on a medium to high heat until the sauce starts to thicken. Once thickened, taste for seasoning and then strain it through a sieve. Now it\u2019s ready to pour.\n\nPull the bones out of the meat and trim off any excess fatty bits. Place the deboned lamb neatly on a beautiful platter, drizzle liberally with the reduced lamb sauce and serve with roasted red onions and some fresh rosemary or mint. Serve the mint dressing on the side or drizzled over the lamb.\n\nMint dressing\n\nThis has been a good \u2018go-to\u2019 dressing recipe for us for ages and it lasts beautifully in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to a week. This dressing is sensational on lamb and even on fresh carrot, spinach and herb or pea salads.\n\nBlend all of the dressing ingredients together in a blender or NutriBullet, and voila! Delish minty drizzle.\n\nReprinted with permission of Kate Lund and Rebecca Lund from their Delish Sisters cookbook published by Penguin Random House South Africa.", "description": "Slow-roasted lamb was always our first choice of dinner when we came home from boarding school for holidays.
