A Republican resistance emerged and so did the \u201cDeep State.\u201d Steve Bannon was back and so was Anonymous. So many developments ... so little time. It\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll recap the week for you.\n\nDamning Testimony\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine gave a vivid and impassioned account Tuesday of how multiple senior administration officials told him that President Donald Trump blocked security aid to Ukraine and refused to meet the country\u2019s leader until he agreed to publicly pledge to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nIn testimony to impeachment investigators delivered in defiance of State Department orders, the diplomat, William Taylor, sketched out in remarkable detail a quid pro quo pressure campaign on Ukraine that Trump and his allies had long denied. He said the president sought to condition the entire U.S. relationship with Ukraine \u2014 including a $391 million aid package \u2014 on a promise that the country would publicly investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. His account implicated Trump, citing multiple sources inside the government.\n\n____\n\nA Republican Resistance\n\nIt was a week of pushback by members of the Republican Party. On Wednesday, House Republicans staged a protest at the Capitol that delayed a crucial deposition in the impeachment inquiry. Chanting \u201cLet us in! Let us in!\u201d about two dozen members pushed past Capitol Police officers to enter the secure rooms of the House Intelligence Committee, where investigators had been conducting private interviews.\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Republicans introduced a resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry. Senior Republican aides said the resolution was not expected to come to the Senate floor for a vote until next week at the earliest.\n\nThe president also got some encouragement from Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and other supporters and former aides. They launched a new radio show from Bannon\u2019s basement, called \u201cWar Room,\u201d to help fight impeachment.\n\nAnd finally, Trump canceled subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post. Officials in the West Wing on Thursday announced that copies of the two papers would no longer be delivered to the White House. The administration is moving to force federal agencies to end their subscriptions, as well.\n\n____\n\nThe Impeachment Inquiry Is On, Judge Says\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge ruled that the House was legally engaged in an impeachment inquiry, delivering a major victory to House Democrats and undercutting arguments by Trump and Republicans that the investigation was a sham. (Rep. Adam Schiff is among those leading the inquiry.)\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is entitled to view secret grand jury evidence gathered by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ruled in a 75-page opinion. Attorney General William Barr had withheld the material from lawmakers.\n\n____\n\nTrump\u2019s War on the \u2018Deep State\u2019 Turns Against Him\n\nNameless, faceless and voiceless, the CIA officer who first set off the impeachment inquiry seemed to be practically the embodiment of the \u201cdeep state\u201d that the president had long accused of trying to take him down.\n\nBut over the last three weeks, the so-called deep state has emerged from the shadows in the form of real live government officials, who have defied a White House attempt to block cooperation with House impeachment investigators and provided evidence that largely backs up the whistleblower. One of the witnesses, Laura Cooper, the military\u2019s Russia-Ukraine expert, received a warning letter before she testified.\n\nAlso worth noting: An anonymous Trump administration official who published a September 2018 essay in The New York Times, about the active resistance to the president\u2019s agenda and behavior from within his own administration, will publish a book next month.\n\n____\n\nIn Ukraine, a Forgotten War\n\nThe New York Times traveled to the front lines of the war in Ukraine, a bare-bones fight against Russian-backed separatists. The war there has killed 13,000 people, put a large part of Ukraine under Russia\u2019s control and dragged on for five years. It was almost forgotten by the outside world until it became a backdrop to the impeachment inquiry. Ukrainian soldiers on the front line were jolted when U.S. military aid was suspended in July. While the aid was restored in time to prevent any military setbacks, it took a heavy psychological toll, they said, striking at their confidence that their backers in Washington stood solidly behind them.", "description": "More damning testimony.
