So far, von der Leyen has not shown any indication that she will change her mind on the name. She could, however, decide that an adjustment now would improve relations with the Parliament and come at no cost, since she would not be seen as being forced to make a retreat.\n\nThursday's backing for Schinas stands in sharp contrast with the weeks of griping about the post, which complicated von der Leyen's hopes of a smooth confirmation process for her team, which is due to take office on November 1.\n\n\"Do you agree the choice of title was a mistake or even worse a case of bad political judgment?\" she asked \u2014 Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in 't Veld\n\nMany MEPs have slammed the \"protecting our European way of life\" title as a \"dog-whistle\" of right-wing extremists. Some had even threatened to reject the job in its current form.\n\nLast month, Iratxe Garc\u00eda, the leader of the S&D group, said in a statement: \"We have a serious problem with linking the \u2018protection of the European Way of Life\u2019 with migration,\" and \"we won\u2019t accept the title as it is.\"\n\nEven though those who criticized his portfolio ended up voting for him, some MEPs tried to confront Schinas during the hearing with tough questions aimed at making him recognize that his portfolio name is a mistake.\n\nDutch liberal MEP Sophie in 't Veld told Schinas that \"if this [the portfolio] was ever meant to unite people it failed miserably because it is divisive and it excludes people.\"\n\n\"Do you agree the choice of title was a mistake or even worse a case of bad political judgment?\" she asked.\n\n\"This title is simply unacceptable,\" said Magid Magid, a British Green MEP, adding that the phrase \"European way of life\" sounds like it was taken from a 1990s extremist internet chat room.\n\nSchinas defended his portfolio and argued that he \"has never shared the view that the title of my portfolio can be a threat or indicate an 'us versus them' culture.\"\n\nHis EPP group was the first political force to put out a statement full of praise, insisting that Schinas, who has worked in the EU institutions for decades, gave an eloquent performance and will be a skilled commissioner.\n\nThe Greek politician \"possesses the necessary attributes and skills for his significant role in the next Commission in this new chapter of European history,\" said Esteban Gonz\u00e1lez Pons, the EPP group's vice chair, after the hearing.\n\nSchinas \"will help us in promoting our common values and principles ... Those that made Europe the most prosperous and welcoming continent in the world,\" Gonz\u00e1lez Pons said.", "description": "Greek nominee sails through his confirmation hearing.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "David M.
