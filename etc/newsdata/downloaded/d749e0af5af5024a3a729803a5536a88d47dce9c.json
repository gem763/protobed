Eliot L. Engel, Adam B. Schiff, and Elijah E. Cummings, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight committees, respectively.\n\n\u201cHe also directly expressed concerns that this critical military assistance and the meeting between the two presidents were being withheld in order to place additional pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the President\u2019s demand for Ukraine to launch politically motivated investigations,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to colleagues.\n\nA whistleblower complaint alleging that President Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky in a July 25 phone call into digging up dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 newly formalized impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn one text exchange, dated July 19, Mr. Volker said in part to Mr. Sondland and William Taylor, Charge d\u2019Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine: \u201cMost impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation - and address any specific personnel issues - if there are any\u201d\n\nIn another, on the morning of the phone call, Mr. Volker texted Mr. Yermak: \u201cGood lunch - thanks. Heard from White House - assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/\u2019get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow- kurt\u201d\n\nIn another exchange, dated Sept. 9, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sondland discussed the notion of withholding military aid for political reasons.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.\n\nMr. Sondland replied: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nHe then suggested they stop the \u201cback and forth by text.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 1, Mr. Taylor had asked: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me,\u201d Mr. Sondland replied.\n\nThe chairmen said that selected portions of the texts had been leaked to the press \u201cout of context,\u201d but that the additional excerpts are still \u201conly a subset of the full body of the materials, which we hope to make public after a review for personally identifiable information.\u201d\n\nMr. Volker, who resigned last week, testified on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Republicans said the appearance did little to advance Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
