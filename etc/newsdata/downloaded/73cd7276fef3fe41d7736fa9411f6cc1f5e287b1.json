He wore a black suit, dark glasses and a scowl. Beside him was team president Bruce Allen.\n\nThey walked almost in step down a concrete corridor, Snyder and Allen did, passing a window that looked into the emptying stands. If they had turned their heads, they would have seen the score still burning on a field-level scoreboard \u2014 Giants 24, Redskins 3 \u2014 that said this season, at 0-4, offers no hope. Their first-round quarterback, Dwayne Haskins, had been intercepted three times in his first game after replacing Case Keenum in the second quarter. The Super Bowl champion New England Patriots loom next week. And in this moment of crisis, Snyder seemed unsure of what to do next.\n\nDoes he fire Gruden, as two people with knowledge of the situation said Snyder was considering last week if the team fell to 0-4? Does he fire defensive coordinator Greg Manusky, whose unit gave up 389 yards and 24 first downs to a rebuilding Giants team with a rookie quarterback, Daniel Jones, making his second career start? Does he do nothing and hope something changes?\n\nFor now, everyone remains.\n\n[The key moments from the Redskins\u2019 24-3 loss to the Giants]\n\nSo Gruden was left walking between an interview room and the locker room mumbling about an early gamble that didn\u2019t work on a day when little did. He shook his head. He thought about all the injured and missing players and seemed unsure himself how this year can fix itself.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see here. Well, the first explanation is Brandon Scherff, Chase Roullier, Jordan Reed, Trent Williams and Terry McLaurin are on the sidelines watching the game,\u201d Gruden said, naming five injured or holding out starters after he was asked why his offense didn\u2019t work Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s the first explanation. Second explanation is the guys we are playing aren\u2019t executing as well as they should be and I\u2019m calling a crappy game.\u201d\n\nThat appeared to sum up an offense that was 2 for 11 on third downs, gained just 176 yards and got only eight first downs. But as running back Chris Thompson later said, \u201cI\u2019m looking at everything, not just Jay.\u201d\n\nThere is no single explanation for what went wrong and for what continues to go wrong. Even when things go right, they go wrong. For the second straight week, the Redskins had a wide receiver get wide open for what should have been an easy touchdown on the game\u2019s first play only to have Keenum overthrow him.\n\nOn the Giants\u2019 first drive, the Redskins stopped New York on third down deep in Washington territory only to have Gruden accept a holding penalty, thinking he could push the Giants out of field goal range. Instead, New York got 16 yards on third down, converted a short fourth down and six plays later scored all the points it needed on a pass from Jones to running back Wayne Gallman.\n\nGallman, who also had a touchdown run in the second quarter to make the score 14-0, was supposed to be a reason the Redskins had a good chance to win this game \u2014 primarily because he wasn\u2019t star back Saquon Barkley, who is out with an ankle sprain. But Gallman and four other Giants rushed through giant holes in Washington\u2019s defense for 164 yards.\n\nThey ran with such ease, New York was able to overcome Jones\u2019s two interceptions \u2014 gifts the Redskins could do nothing with because they couldn\u2019t move the ball.\n\nWith Keenum missing several open throws, Gruden pulled his starter for Haskins, the rookie the coaches have not wanted to play because they didn\u2019t think he was ready. And while Haskins did help get a few first downs, he mostly struggled as the Giants\u2019 pass rush swarmed through yet another makeshift offensive line.\n\n[Perspective: This wasn\u2019t about Jones vs. Haskins. It was a well-run NFL franchise vs. the Redskins.]\n\nHis final line was not pretty, especially compared to that of fellow first-rounder Jones, who only had eight incompletions. Haskins completed 9 of 17 passes for 107 yards, was sacked twice and had three interceptions, the third of which was returned 32 yards by Jabrill Peppers for a touchdown that made the score 24-3 and all but ended any hope the Redskins would come back.\n\nKeenum bluntly said he was \u201csurprised\u201d to be benched.\n\nHaskins said he \u201cdidn\u2019t execute the way I wanted to.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe good thing about it is that it hurts and there are going to be brighter days tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen that tomorrow comes was uncertain. Gruden did not commit to using Haskins next week against New England despite the crumbling season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just worried about tonight,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich could have been an answer to a number of questions.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just not handed the keys because of where you are drafted,\u201d Gruden continued.\n\nAs to who will hold the keys to what doors at the team facility, that was to be determined Monday. The players did not blame the coaches, but frustration is setting in. Many, especially on the defense, believed this was going to be a strong team and had remained encouraged following the season\u2019s first two defeats. Sunday was different, though. Even defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, who attacks each defeat with a vow to play better, brushed out of the locker room with a flurry of words in Spanish.\n\nAfter most of the players had left, running back Adrian Peterson put his shoulder on Haskins\u2019s shoulder and whispered in his ear. Encouragement, Peterson later said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be good,\u201d Peterson promised.\n\nPeterson, though, is the team\u2019s past. Haskins is its future. And in the nearly empty locker room, there did not look to be a steady bridge between the two.", "description": "Washington fell to 0-4 with a 24-3 loss to New York, but owner Daniel Snyder did not immediately announce a decision about whether he will retain the head coach.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TA4CnPqFIkHM6x3Uy_tb_mVhbFA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PW2SDHHC6UI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
