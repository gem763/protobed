Williams, with 72 retail stores and a fast-growing online presence, had been hamstrung from achieving its growth potential because the plant had been running at full capacity.\n\n\"Capacity has been a restraint in the 2019 period. Demand is ahead of supply,'' he said.\n\n\"There's a lot of opportunity and headroom for this company,'' he said.\n\nHe said the group is tapping in to a new generation of customers in the younger demographic who value sustainability and longevity of products.\n\n\"We call them boot boys and boot girls,'' Mr Vuppalapati said.\n\nSpurning fast fashion\n\nIn an era of fast fashion where chains such as Zara, H&M and Uniqlo sell cheap garments with a short shelf life aimed at customers wanting to discard items quickly for a new look, R.M. Williams is at the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\n\"It's not just R.M. Williams but all brands with authenticity,'' he said. Longevity and sustainability had been at the core of the company's products since it began in 1932.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Fortunately for us, we don't have to do anything different''. The group runs a re-sole and repairs service where 28,000 pairs of boots are sent to the plant each year to be reinvigorated. He pointed to a pair of boots being readied for a clean-up that were made in 1965 and are still going strong.\n\nMr Vuppalapati prefers the term ''workshop'' to factory to describe the 30,000 sq m Salisbury plant and is proud of an expansion of manufacturing in his industry where offshoring of production is the norm.\n\n\"We are actually going the other way,'' he said.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in financial year 2019 reached $23 million and the company is budgeting for $30 million in EBITDA in fiscal 2020.\n\nA new collaboration with star industrial designer Marc Newson on a range of gardener boots is about to be launched as part of an expansion. Mr Newson has worked with big-name brands including Apple, Nike, Louis Vuitton and Qantas.\n\nGreatest Showman\n\nActor Hugh Jackman is a 5 per cent shareholder in R.M. Williams, while IFM Investors has 13 per cent. L Catterton owns 82 per cent and has controlled the group after a buyout in 2014 from former owner, News Corp executive Ken Cowley.\n\nMr Vuppalapati said Mr Jackman, who is a global ambassador for the brand, is a hands-off investor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Hugh is a private investor. He stays that way,'' Mr Vuppalapati said. Mr Jackman, who visited the Salisbury plant in March, has a representative on the board.\n\nHugh Jackman performs on stage in New York during Hugh Jackman The Man. The Music. The Show. Kevin Mazur\n\nMr Vuppalapati said online sales now made up about 6 per cent of overall sales, and were growing strongly, with the brand now sold by e-commerce groups such as The Iconic.\n\nOnce the new production line is in place by early 2020 the production output would rise initially to 350,000 pairs of boots, and through extra shifts being added, increase to 500,000 pairs of boots.\n\n\"By 2023 we will be at half a million pairs of boots,'' he said.\n\nThe leather goods maker was founded by the late Reginald Murray Williams in 1932.", "description": "R.M.
