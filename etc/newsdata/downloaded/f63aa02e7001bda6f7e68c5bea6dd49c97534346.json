The brand abruptly cancelled it after recent controversies, including a connection to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, and an executive\u2019s comments about transgender models that sparked a furor.\n\nCourtesy: @seyitaylor/Twitter More\n\nTo its credit, Victoria\u2019s Secret is looking to turn things around.\n\nControversial CMO Ed Razek stepped down recently, the brand hired its first openly transgender model and it seems to have full support from its parent company. And at L Brands\u2019 investor meeting earlier this month, Victoria\u2019s Secret executives agreed that things need to change \u2014 with the head of its lingerie department promising an \u201cevolution.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Customers have] been very vocal about what [they\u2019d] like to see from us in terms of inclusivity, #MeToo, rethinking the fashion show. We\u2019re essentially in agreement at this,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Rihanna\u2019s fledgling career as a make-up and clothing mogul shows how upstarts are laying claim to territory Victoria Secret once owned indisputably. Meanwhile, the lingerie company, owned by L brands, saw quarterly sales fall once again in its latest reported period, slipping 7% from a year earlier. The stock is down roughly 25% year to date.\n\n2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on November 8, 2018 at Pier 94 in New York City More\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret knows the stakes are high. Brand changes already in the works will include hiring more diverse models, and, taking a cue from competitors like Aerie (AEO), which rely on untouched advertisements and body-positive campaigns to drive sales.\n\nStill, investors are cautiously optimistic with many industry experts believing it might just be too little too late.\n\nFormer Victoria\u2019s Secret model Nina Agdal previously told Yahoo Finance the brand \u201chas a long way to go\u201d before rebounding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Rihanna\u2019s \u2018Savage X Fenty Show\u2019 dropped on Amazon Prime \u2014 and the reviews highlight why market leader Victoria's Secret has been struggling.", "authors": ["Alexandra Canal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rxdr93uFE860TSVcW2xESA--~B/aD0yMjIyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/459f7b90-e16f-11e9-9fff-edc29cc5a388", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
