All the players are world class from different international teams and we know what to face tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe football Tottenham play is very beautiful to watch and it\u2019s innovative and creative. We have to make sure we have the mental and physical resilience to respond to their new challengers.\u201d\n\nSpurs\u2019 biggest threat is Harry Kane, who has scored 160 goals in all competitions in the past five seasons, and Kovac said he saw similarities in his own striker Robert Lewandowski, who has finished as Bundesliga\u2019s top scorer four times.\n\n\u201cHis (Kane) quality in the Premier League and England squad speaks for itself. He\u2019s sensational and he can do it all,\u201d Kovac said. \u201cHe\u2019s good at holding up and good with his head. There\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t do, he\u2019s a very strong striker.\n\n\u201cHim and Lewandowski are probably the top two, three or four in the world. I will see how things pan out tomorrow. Both don\u2019t miss a lot of chances and are both very hungry.\n\n\u201cWe know that Harry Kane is very dangerous and we\u2019ll have to do our best to not let him score.\u201d\n\nKovac confirmed defender Lucas Hernandez, who was injured in their last Bundesliga match at Paderborn, was not involved in training while full back David Alaba and winger Ivan Perisic would be fit to play on Tuesday.", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur's philosophy under manager Mauricio Pochettino should be held up as a beacon for clubs competing in Europe and is proof that patience is ultimately rewarded, Bayern Munich manager Niko Kovac said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435663240&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T187", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
