Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nElizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, is a strong candidate for president. She has a clear and compelling message about the unfair distribution of American prosperity. She\u2019s smart, well versed in economics, and far more lucid than her fellow front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden. She\u2019s a charismatic speaker. At campaign events, she\u2019s excellent at answering voters\u2019 questions.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big risk for Democrats in nominating Warren: that beneath her talents, she has the soul of an ideologue. If that\u2019s how she conducts herself in the general election\u2014or if Republicans can effectively paint her that way\u2014it substantially increases the danger that President Donald Trump will be reelected. And if Warren were to beat Trump, this disposition would make her a counterproductive president, more likely to revive the Republican Party than to enact significant legislation.\n\nOn this question\u2014the question of who Warren is\u2014Tuesday night\u2019s debate sent ominous signals.\n\nWarren did show pragmatism on a few issues. Instead of confiscating assault weapons, she proposed to focus on achievable gun laws. She agreed that American troops should come home from Syria, but she stipulated that it had to be done as part of a negotiated agreement. When fellow candidate Andrew Yang challenged her claims about automation, employment, and income subsidies, she said she was open to evidence. \u201cI want to understand the data,\u201d she told Yang. \u201cI want to make sure we\u2019re responding to make this work.\u201d\n\nBut on the biggest issue, Warren nailed herself to a coercive and unpopular position. She insisted on a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d program that would abolish all private insurance for basic health care. And she ruled out the idea that she might pivot to a voluntary alternative\u2014Medicare for All Who Want It\u2014that would allow people to keep their private insurance if they preferred it. \u201cI will not embrace a plan like \u2018Medicare for all who can afford it\u2019 that will leave behind millions of people,\u201d the senator declared, using a pejorative term for the voluntary approach.\n\nWarren gave two reasons why she couldn\u2019t tolerate nongovernment insurance. First, a private insurer could limit its coverage or reject a claim. \u201cI will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis, and the insurance company says, \u2018Sorry, we\u2019re not covering your expensive cancer treatments,\u2019 \u201d she explained. Second, she argued that private insurers stay afloat by denying necessary care and that they otherwise contribute nothing to cost containment. \u201cEvery dollar of profit that an insurance company made last year,\u201d she told a CNN panel after the debate, \u201cwas made by saying one word: No.\u201d\n\nWhen CNN\u2019s Van Jones questioned the wisdom of coercing everyone into Medicare, Warren responded as though she didn\u2019t understand the objection. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to be forced,\u201d Jones reminded the senator. \u201cWhy is that good politics? Don\u2019t you think Americans are going to feel like you\u2019re forcing something on them they don\u2019t want?\u201d Rather than engage the question, Warren repeated her talking point: \u201cWe should leave no one behind.\u201d Jones persisted: \u201cWhat about the people who \u2026 want to have the freedom to opt out? Do you care about them and their freedom to opt out?\u201d Again, Warren batted the question away. \u201cWhat I care about,\u201d she told Jones, \u201cis that they don\u2019t get pushed out\u201d of being covered at all.\n\nWarren also dismissed queries about the cost of her proposal. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author of the Senate\u2019s Medicare for All bill, argued that on balance, his bill\u2014which Warren supports\u2014would save people money by eliminating premiums, deductibles, and copayments. But he conceded that as part of the math, Medicare for All would require a big tax hike on the middle class. Warren refused to make the same concession, despite being asked several times. In her post-debate interview, she said the price of her plan could \u201cvary by literally trillions and trillions of dollars.\u201d She said \u201crevenue streams\u201d would cover it, but she didn\u2019t explain what they were.\n\nPolls suggest that if Warren becomes the nominee, her crusade for a government monopoly on health insurance will be a significant liability. But her hard line on health care is just one part of a sweeping, invasive agenda that could alarm many voters. \u201cOn the first day, I will \u2026 repeal the filibuster,\u201d she told the debate audience. \u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it.\u201d Warren demanded that every major American company allot 40 percent of its board seats to directors chosen by employees. She also defended her pledge to dismantle several corporations. \u201cWe need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them.\u201d\n\nThis scorched-earth campaign might help Warren get the nomination. But it might burn her.\n\nWhen other candidates disagreed with Warren\u2014pointing out, for example, that her proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of the superrich had been tried and abandoned in other countries because it didn\u2019t yield the projected revenues\u2014she accused them of selling out. \u201cWhy \u2026 does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d Warren protested. She accused her rivals of \u201ctaking money from the big tech executives\u201d and \u201ctaking money from big drug executives.\u201d\n\nThis scorched-earth campaign might help Warren get the nomination. But it might burn her, by provoking other Democrats to form an opposition bloc in the center of the party. During the debate, several candidates challenged Warren\u2019s extremism. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told her, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up.\u201d Tom Steyer, a Democratic donor-turned-candidate, said the party should \u201ctalk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector,\u201d not just \u201ctax and have programs to break up companies.\u201d\n\nThe greater danger to Warren, as a candidate and potentially as the nominee, is that her positions on these issues will contribute to a portrait of her as a zealot. \u201cYour idea is not the only idea,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told Warren. O\u2019Rourke made a related point: \u201cSometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up.\u201d Buttigieg chimed in, \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with Sen. Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat.\u201d\n\nWarren professed dismay at these rebukes. \u201cI\u2019m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d she said. Her surprise might well be genuine because she spends her days in a bubble of love. She seldom does interviews with aggressive journalists. She answers a few questions at each rally, but the questioners adore her. After the debate, when she was asked whether Medicare for All would require a tax increase, she suggested that real people didn\u2019t care about that. \u201cThe tens of thousands of people who come through the selfie line to me talk about their costs,\u201d not their taxes, she said. But the people in Warren\u2019s selfie lines aren\u2019t the voters Democrats need to attract. They\u2019re already in the bag.\n\nMaybe Warren has a secret plan to win the election. Maybe, if she wraps up the nomination, she\u2019ll modify Medicare for All and repackage herself as a sensible progressive who can unite the country. But Tuesday\u2019s performance suggests otherwise. It suggests that the senator we\u2019ve seen in recent encounters\u2014dismissive of religious conservatives, defiant about making false statements, only vaguely apologetic for having claimed Native American ancestry\u2014is the real Elizabeth Warren. Tenacity isn\u2019t always a virtue.", "description": "Tuesday\u2019s debate points to trouble for Democrats if she wins the nomination.", "authors": ["William Saletan"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/37d7a90b-daf1-4c08-828c-60e820371c8a.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
