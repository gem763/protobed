Res. 604, according to a list obtained by Breitbart News. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for retelling a fictional phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nSchiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nCongressman Biggs\u2019 legislation has quickly gained support throughout the House Republican Conference. Support for the resolution extends from the House Freedom Caucus conservatives to moderates and House GOP leadership.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the resolution quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Last Thursday, Breitbart News reported 45 House Republicans have cosponsored the resolution. Last Friday, the bill gained 61 cosponsors. On Monday, the resolution had 73 sponsors, and support for the bill has reached triple digits as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe bill\u2019s growing list of Republican sponsors shows the GOP has moved to defend President Donald Trump against House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhen Biggs sponsored the bill, he said Schiff\u2019s stunt was \u201cinexcusable\u201d to \u201cmislead the American public with such a statement.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.
