'He is having another wave of agony over his mother, Princess Diana. The trip was going to be very difficult as he was retracing his mother's steps.'\n\nHarry made an 'emotional' pilgrimage to Huambo to follow in the steps of his mother - who famously walked through a partially cleared Angolan minefield.\n\nDuring a day of symbolism that saw Harry wear body armour and a protective mask as Diana had done to watch a de-mining team at work, and tour an orthopaedic unit she visited \u2013 he said her memory remains with him 'daily' and her 'legacy' lived on.\n\nHe added that the visit was 'deeply personal and meaningful' to him.\n\nIt comes after Harry and Meghan (pictured on the programme) opened up in a behind-the-scenes documentary on Sunday, which followed the pair on their ten-day tour of South Africa\n\nMeanwhile, Angela suggested that there is more to the royal pair's 'unhappiness' than just the prince's recent trip.\n\nIt comes after Harry and Meghan opened up in a behind-the-scenes documentary on Sunday, which followed the couple during their ten-day tour of South Africa.\n\nIn ITV's 'Harry & Meghan: An African Journey', the former Suits actress revealed she was 'existing not living' while her husband spoke out about his struggles with mental health.\n\nMeghan described struggling with the pressures of royal life and the 'damaging' impact of a British stiff upper lip.\n\nIn what was the first on-screen interview since becoming a mother, the American former actress admitted to feeling 'vulnerable' during her pregnancy with Archie under the media spotlight.\n\nMeghan added: 'I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair and that's the part that's really hard to reconcile.\n\n'I've said for a long time to H \u2013 that's what I call him \u2013 it is not enough to just survive something. That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive and feel happy.\n\nShe added: 'I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried. But I think what that does internally is probably really damaging.'", "description": "Speaking on Sky News, royal biographer Angela Levin said it's 'incredibly sad' that Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, 'can't seem to help each other' out of their mutual unhappiness at the moment.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20124362-0-image-a-2_1571909711684.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
