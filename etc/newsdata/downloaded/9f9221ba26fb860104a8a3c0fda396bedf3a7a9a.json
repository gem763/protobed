Every New York City electric customer will help pay for about $240 million in upgrades to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s system pushed for by Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 if the Public Service Commission approves the rate plan.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCon Ed took over some work on the MTA\u2019s facilities in an unusual arrangement after Cuomo blamed the utility for thousands of delays, a figure that was likely inflated, amid public outrage over subway problems in the summer of 2017.\n\n\u201cCon Ed was a convenient political scapegoat for Governor Cuomo to blame for the meltdown in subway service,\u201d said Reinvent Albany\u2019s John Kaehny in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cThe governor did a lot of chest thumping about Con Ed having to pay huge amounts for emergency electrical upgrades, but it was obvious Con Ed would eventually pass those costs onto its customers. That day has come, and Con Ed customers will soon be paying a backdoor MTA tax.\u201d\n\nThe Public Service Commission, the utility regulator Cuomo effectively controls, first ordered Con Ed to perform work on its own equipment serving the MTA in August, 2017. It made clear the utility wouldn\u2019t be expected to do work on the MTA-owned portion of the system.\n\nBut then, in an October order, the PSC directed the utility to take over contracts and costs dealing with the MTA electric system and pay for upgrades and repairs. The commission punted on the cost issue, but it was clear Con Ed would seek to recover its costs from ratepayers.\n\n\u201cTo protect the health, safety and welfare of the public in New York City and the surrounding suburbs, Con Edison was directed to address service outages, derailments and disruptions on the MTA subway system,\u201d said Public Service Commission spokesperson Jim Denn.\n\n\u201cThe Department\u2019s investigation found that power quality weaknesses of the Con Edison and MTA systems are inextricably intertwined and that any solution would need to focus jointly on both systems. That conclusion was confirmed by an independent engineering expert that worked cooperatively with the MTA, Con Edison and DPS on the power quality issues involving both systems, and costs related to the repair are being considered.\u201d\n\nThe PSC has refused to release the report in response to a public records request, citing \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d The rate proposal will be subject to public comment and may be modified by the PSC.\n\nThe utility did take responsibility for two major subway delays due to power outages in April and May 2017.", "description": "If the plan is approved, every New York City customer will help pay for about $240 million in upgrades.", "authors": ["Marie J.
