Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nI recently found myself entranced by a series of type generators \u2014 websites that allow you to create experimental animated type, then transform them into personal pieces of moving art. It\u2019s easy to lose track of time playing with all the settings. And if you get frustrated (and I honestly don\u2019t believe you can because they\u2019re so fun) there are presets you can toggle to help.\n\nThe mastermind behind these sites is Kiel Mutschelknaus, a multidisciplinary artist whose work spans design, animation, typography, and recently, coding. Mutschelknaus, an educator at Maryland Institute College of Art in their graphic design department, has been working on more than 30 different generators, and he\u2019s published four online so far. He calls them Space Type Generators, and the different versions \u2014 v.Cylinder, v.Field, v.Stripes, and v.Coil \u2014 offer different parameters you can customize, like how the text animates, the colors, speed and, of course, what the text says.\n\nI reached out to Mutschelknaus to learn more about the generators and his process.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind making these generators?\n\nThey mainly come from a place of learning and experimentation. Last year I was creating these typographic chandeliers and it was so hard to experiment and iterate on the forms with the software I was using (After Effects and Cinema 4D). It took the programs forever to render changes. I decided to switch up the tools and translated into a coded environment, Processing.\n\nFrom there it just exploded. I could get instant feedback of the forms through changing the parameters as it was animating. I kept adding more and more waves and parameters to different aspects of those forms. It was crazy easy to generate motion graphics. And to generate generators. And to iterate on those generators. Crazy fruitful. I\u2019ve ended up with 30+ generators.\n\nWhat is your process in building one of these? What do you use?\n\nI start coding them in Processing, which is a Java-based coding environment for coding noobs like myself. If I think the generator is efficient enough to run in a browser, I recreate it in JavaScript with the p5.js library (which is some JS that closely mirrors Processing). Then it\u2019s just pushing it to the site.\n\nI always get questions about what the typeface is. The type in the generator isn\u2019t an existing typeface. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve coded directly in Processing / p5.js that is a series of lines with a stroke applied to it. It\u2019s my very rough, makeshift variable font I call LoFi Mono. I would love to explore getting actual fonts to work in the generators.\n\nWhere did you learn the skills needed to build something like this?\n\nIt\u2019s been largely self-taught from YouTube University. I had a pretty traditional, print-based graphic design and illustration background. In grad school at Cranbrook, I started to explore motion graphics and that quickly led to learning 3D and coding. And then I started teaching motion graphics! Which turned out to be a really great way to learn more about it.\n\nI\u2019ve also always had an interest in math and that\u2019s really come in handy with these recent experiments in waves and trigonometry.\n\nOne of the many reasons I really enjoy your work is that it\u2019s a nice blend of design, type, motion graphics, and coding \u2014 did you always have an interest in coding or did that come later?\n\nIt came later. I started with motion graphics and I found the bridge from there to coding to be very direct. Motion graphics and coding both have a basis in loops and embedded animations and connected systems and objects and parameters, and really it\u2019s all the same thing.\n\nYou\u2019re currently full-time faculty at the Maryland Institute College of Arts\u2019 graphic design department, can you tell us a little about what you teach there?\n\nI teach classes in motion graphics, 3D, and some foundational graphic design classes. I\u2019ve always enjoyed emerging technologies and processes and that\u2019s become my niche in the department. My 3D / 4D graphics class is actually going to be designing 360 environments for our final project and I\u2019m hoping we can critique the pieces in VR, which I\u2019m very excited about.\n\nHow does teaching compare to freelancing?\n\nThey inform each other in a surprisingly symbiotic way. I\u2019m able to bring client projects from my studio practice to the class to illustrate IRL examples of what we\u2019re talking about. And on the other end, I\u2019m constantly bringing ideas that come up in our class back to my studio practice. (Those early typographic chandeliers that inspired all these pieces actually came from a motion tracking demo I was doing for my advanced motion graphics class.)\n\nIf someone was interested in learning how to build similar apps or sites, what advice would you give them?\n\nFor coding start with Processing. And Daniel Shiffman. I\u2019m a devout follower of D. Shiffman and the church of Processing. He\u2019s so generous with his YouTube channel and his online books. It\u2019s a great, great place to begin learning about the core concepts of coding.\n\nDo people share what they make using your generators with you?\n\nYeah! I don\u2019t always get tagged, but people have been great using the #SpaceTypeGenerator. I\u2019m really excited when I see it being used as one component of a larger designed piece. It\u2019s satisfying to see STG used as an actual image-making tool alongside PS or AI.\n\nDo you have a favorite?\n\nI recently collaborated with Post Typography to create a custom generator for an identity project they had. Their designers had been playing with STG v.Field and it was incredibly rewarding to see practicing professionals I admire twisting and breaking the tool into really beautiful forms. They were generating visuals I hadn\u2019t considered before. Very exciting.\n\nDo you have anything you\u2019re working on now you\u2019d like to share?\n\nI have like five new generators running through my mind. Those will probably start in Processing and possibly migrate to an online home. I\u2019m having a real challenge with optimizing some of my existing Processing generators so they can work in a browser with JavaScript.\n\nI\u2019m really interested in bringing one of the Perlin noise generators online. There\u2019s lots of beautiful, flowing, random forms I would love to see people experiment with.\n\nDo you have any exhibitions planned for the future?\n\nNo, but it\u2019s something I want to do. Instagram has been a great platform to share these but I would like to see them in a physical space. Whether it\u2019s an interactive installation or large-scale prints, I really want to get them off the small screens.\n\nNot a question, just want to share with you how much I love this:\n\nYeah! Thanks! I used my first type generator to create the forms, brought them into C4D, and played with reflection and light to create the movement. Ugh. I\u2019d love to come back and explore this more, too.
