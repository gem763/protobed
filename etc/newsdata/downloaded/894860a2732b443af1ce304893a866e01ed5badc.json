Its new test is a slightly weird one \u2013 the company is adding a feature to let you speed up or slow down video playback on your phone.\n\nAccording to a report by Android Police, the streaming platform is exploring an option on its Android app that\u2019ll let you speed up episodes up to 1.5x and slow them down to 0.5x.\n\nNetflix speed adjustment test\n\nThe company confirmed it\u2019s a mobile-only test in a blog post:\n\nWe\u2019re always experimenting with new ways to help members use Netflix.This is a mobile only test and gives people the ability to vary the speed at which they watch on phones or tablets \u2013 choosing from normal to slower (0.5X or 0.75X) or faster (1.25X and 1.5X). It\u2019s a feature that has long been available on DVD players \u2013 and has been frequently requested by our members.\n\nNetflix added that this feature can help you skip to the part in an episode with your favorite scene, or slow it down for a fast-paced or a foreign-language title. Netflix VP Keela Robertson said the app also adjusts the pitch of the audio when you change the playing speed, so it doesn\u2019t sound weird.\n\nIt\u2019s quite common for podcast listeners to speed up playback speed to consume more content. However, I\u2019m not sure if the experience will be enjoyable with speeding videos up.\n\nIt\u2019s quite common for podcast listeners to speed up playback speed to consume more content.

But for what it\u2019s worth, my colleague Abhimanyu staunchly disagrees, as he routinely watches YouTube videos at 1.5x to get through his watch list.\n\nThankfully, Netflix said it\u2019s not planning to roll out this feature anytime soon.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F03%2FNetflix-mobile-hed.jpg&signature=16ebcc4e7fb68ceef818df9cd0ca93d6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
