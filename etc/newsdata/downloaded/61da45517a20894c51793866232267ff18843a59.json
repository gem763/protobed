Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\nBeijing also said that \u201cserious\u201d mid-level talks will begin in mid-September, cheering Wall Street investors who are sensitive to changes in the roller-coaster trade war.\n\nMrs. Sanders, who left the White House at the end of June, spoke to Fox News as new job numbers showed non-farm payrolls increased by 130,000, or short of Wall Street estimates of 150,000.\n\nThe former press aide said the economy is still strong, even if the August report fell short of expectations.\n\n\u201cI think at the end of the day there is no question the president and his administration have turned the country around and put it on the right track,\u201d Mrs. Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s still the strongest economy in the world.\u201d\n\nFailure to take on China, she said, would send the economy in the wrong direction, as the White House seeks to undo what it views as Beijing\u2019s unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property.\n\nIf the U.S. relents, she said, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna lose our country and we\u2019re gonna lose a lot more American jobs.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Dave Boyer contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
