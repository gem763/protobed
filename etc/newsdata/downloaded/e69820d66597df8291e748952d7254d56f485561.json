At Trump\u2019s direction, the White House released a reconstruction of the call, and Maguire acknowledged that the complaint is \u201cin alignment\u201d with what those notes revealed. The complaint also alleges that senior White House officials acted immediately to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call.\n\nRead: The problem with the whistle-blower system\n\nDemocrats at the hearing immediately argued that the allegations amounted to a \u201cbetrayal\u201d by the president of his oath of office and the nation, as well as a cover-up. They saw them as bolstering their case for an impeachment investigation. But they spent most of today\u2019s hearing pressing Maguire on why he withheld the complaint from Congress, in contravention, they argued, of a federal whistle-blower law requiring him to turn it over.\n\n\u201cI believe that everything in this matter is totally unprecedented,\u201d Maguire testified in his defense. He explained that because the complaint touched on a phone call between the president and a foreign leader, he thought it was \u201cprudent\u201d to first seek guidance from the White House counsel and the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel as to whether the allegations would be protected by executive privilege. He also disagreed with a finding by the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general that the complaint raised an \u201curgent concern,\u201d which by law would require its prompt transmission to Congress.\n\nDemocrats harped on Maguire\u2019s decision to go first to the White House and the Department of Justice on the grounds that there was an inherent conflict of interest given that the complaint implicated both Trump and Attorney General William Barr. Maguire said he felt he had no choice. \u201cI am not authorized as the director of national intelligence to waive executive privilege,\u201d he said.\n\nMaguire denied a report in The Washington Post that he\u2019d threatened to resign if the White House ordered him to withhold the complaint from Congress. But throughout the hearing, he did little to challenge the notion that this was a job he did not seek and, given his current predicament, did not particularly want. Maguire, 68, was running the National Counterterrorism Center when Trump asked him to serve as acting DNI after Dan Coats, a former senator from Indiana, resigned this summer. He picked him over Coats\u2019s deputy, Sue Gordon, who left the government after Trump made clear he would not allow her to become acting director.", "description": "Joseph Maguire did not endorse the explosive allegations of an anonymous whistle-blower, but neither did he rise to the president\u2019s defense.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1171323588/facebook.jpg?1569506794", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
