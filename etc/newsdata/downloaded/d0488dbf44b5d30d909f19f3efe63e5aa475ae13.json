Ta\u2019Mya Bulger, 13, became her middle school's first female football player \u2014 and was also named homecoming queen\n\nDouble duty: She recently won the popularity contest at Clanton Middle School in Alabama during halftime for a football game she was playing in\n\nTa\u2019Mya is an enthusiastic athlete, and also plays girls basketball, soccer, and track.\n\nShe became interested in football when her little brother started to play, and joined a team back in fifth grade.\n\nBut her mother, Tamera Hinton, told Yahoo that she didn't let her try out for the school team until seventh grade, worried about her playing with boys her age.\n\nShe finally gave her the OK, and this fall, Ta\u2019Mya joined the football team as a wide receiver and defensive back, making her the first ever girl to play.\n\n'I loved it,' her coach, Thomas Hughes, told CBS42. 'I told her when she asked me if she could play \u2014 absolutely, I told her [I\u2019d] loved to have her come out and see what she had.'\n\nHead-to-head: She's been playing football for years, but her mom only recently let her join the school team and play with her male classmates\n\nOne of the guys: Ta\u2019Mya said she doesn't mind being the only girl, and she's not treated any differently (pictured with her teammates)\n\nWhat a dream!

It\u2019s like being at school with a bunch of boys,' she said.\n\nIn fact, she seems to be quite popular among her classmates, since she won the homecoming queen title this fall.\n\nHer mother is thrilled with how she juggles her various interests.\n\n'As a mom, it was incredible,' she told Yahoo Lifestyle. 'She\u2019s humble, she\u2019s not the most \u2018status quo\u2019 popular girl, but she\u2019s kind, she\u2019s on the honor roll, and she\u2019s probably the most athletic in the school. It was nice that she got this recognition.'\n\nTa\u2019Mya added that she hopes to keep playing football through high school, but her main focus is soccer, which she'd like to play in college.", "description": "Ta'Mya Bulger, 13, recently won homecoming queen during a halftime ceremony for a football game she was playing in at\u00a0Clanton Middle School in Alabama.", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19699930-0-image-a-53_1571068066533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
