However, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal last year, arguing it did not go far enough, and reimposed sanctions.\n\nTehran responded with two separate moves that breached some of the terms of the deal, although it says it still aims to save the pact.\n\nRouhani had threatened to take further measures by Sept. 5 unless France and the other European signatories of the pact did more to protect Iran from the impact of the U.S. penalties.\n\n\u201cI think it is unlikely that we will reach a result with Europe by today or tomorrow ... Europe will have another two months to fulfil its commitments,\u201d Rouhani said, according to state TV.\n\n\u201cThe talks between Iran and European countries are moving forward ... but we have yet to reach a conclusion,\u201d he added.\n\nIran would continue with plans to breach the pact further and accelerate its nuclear activity, Rouhani said, without giving a fresh deadline.\n\n\u201cThe third step (in reducing Iran\u2019s commitments) will be the most important one and it will have extraordinary effects,\u201d state TV reported him as saying.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani attends the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Dushanbe, Tajikistan June 15, 2019.

That ship was released in August.\n\nIran\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi appeared to back the main terms of the French proposal in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur return to the full implementation of the nuclear accord is subject to the receipt of $15 billion over a four-month period, otherwise the process of reducing Iran\u2019s commitments will continue,\u201d the semi-official news agency Fars quoted Araqchi as saying.\n\n\u201cEither Europe has to buy oil from Iran or provide Iran with the equivalent of selling oil as a credit line guaranteed by Iran\u2019s oil revenues, which in some sense means a pre-sale of oil,\u201d Araqchi added.\n\nGovernment spokesman Ali Rabie said Iran would stick to its nuclear commitments \u201cif France can get the approval of the U.S. and announces it.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they cannot get the approval, then we will take the third step.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Iran's top nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi talks to journalists after meeting senior officials from the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany and France in a hotel in Vienna, Austria, October 19, 2015.

Washington has not commented on the proposal which would contradict its stated policy of imposing \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to force Tehran to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes as well as what the White House views as its destabilising regional behaviour.\n\nIran\u2019s English-language Press TV issued a short report stating: \u201cIran has rejected a $15 billion loan offered by EU\u201d - though Western and Iranian sources had described the French plan as the offer of a credit line, not a loan. Precise details of the plan have not been made public.", "description": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani gave European powers another two months to save a 2015 nuclear deal on Wednesday, but warned that Tehran was still preparing for further significant breaches of the agreement if diplomatic efforts failed.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426079338&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830PV"}
