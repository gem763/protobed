Accompanying the album announcement are two singles: \"Hyperlife,\" a glowing pool of synth pads and swirling vocals, and \"Uneventful Days,\" a syrupy rainforest banger. The pair are wildly different yet both somehow trademark Beck, a testament to his wide-ranging sound. (\"Saw Lightning,\" which came out in April, is also set to be on the album.)\n\nYouTube\n\nHyperspace may push Beck's sonic palette even further into hip-hop territory, as it features extensive co-writing and co-production from Pharrell Williams, who contributed to the three singles released from it so far. (Other collaborators include Sky Ferreira, Chris Martin, Terrell Hines and Paul Epworth.) It'll be Beck's first studio album since 2017's Colors, which won Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical at the 61st Grammy Awards.", "description": "The musical polymath's new album, which features collaborations with Pharrell, Chris Martin, Sky Ferreira and more, is due out November 22.", "authors": ["Mano Sundaresan"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/17/beck_wide-476c36ffa0341c3628e0756f6c7c7bf456c17d53.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
