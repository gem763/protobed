Mike Lee (R-Utah) intends to bring up the letter and address the issue at a Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing Tuesday, his office confirmed to Axios.\n\nBe smart: Both agencies have clashed over who has jurisdiction to investigate, particularly Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year the two agencies agreed that they would divide up investigations into the companies, with the DOJ taking on Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Apple, and the FTC looking into Facebook and Amazon.\n\nTensions apparently rose in July when the DOJ announced another sweeping investigation into Big Tech platforms for their dominance, a move which reportedly had the FTC concerned that the DOJ would be stepping on its turf to investigate Facebook.\n\nThe big picture: A growing list of media investigations are presenting evidence of tech platforms abusing their dominance to promote their own products and services.\n\nOn Monday, the Journal reported that Amazon has changed its search function to more prominently feature products that are more profitable for the company. Amazon denies the report, saying it features products customers want, \"regardless of whether they are our own brands or products offered by our selling partners.\"\n\nLast week, a New York Times investigation revealed that Apple-owned apps often top rivals in its own App Store.\n\nFriday, the House Judiciary Committee sent Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon lengthy document requests, including executives' private communications, for its own investigation into the companies' practices.\n\nThe bottom line: Multiple probes can help regulators cover the vast territory they have set out to explore. But any time and resources they spend fighting each other will only benefit the companies they are seeking to hold accountable.\n\nGo deeper: The growing list of U.S. government inquiries into Big Tech\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated since publication.", "description": "Multiple probes can cover more ground, but they could end up fighting each other.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/vZdpXZCvp4eNbgvcnki5gu0FL3o=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/09/17/1568724906140.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
