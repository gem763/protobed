SiteLock evaluated cyber awareness based on how integrated cybersecurity was in a candidate\u2019s platform, how often the candidate discussed it, and the actions taken in relation to cybersecurity by the candidate.\n\nSome of the factors SiteLock used to make these evaluations were whether a candidate had ever been involved in a data breach, whether campaign email addresses had been found on the dark web, if the candidate had publicly supported legislation on cybersecurity issues and whether the candidate had a published privacy policy on their campaign website.\n\nSiteLock also scanned candidate websites to ascertain how at-risk they were to cyberattacks, finding that 58 percent of the candidates\u2019 sites use out-of-date software.\n\n\u201cTechnically, anything short of perfect cybersecurity awareness practices should be viewed as a security flaw because it only takes a single vulnerability to fall victim to a bad actor,\u201d SiteLock wrote in a blog post announcing the report card findings. \u201cThe fact that not one candidate can be credited with a perfect score proves that cybersecurity awareness is an overlooked issue.\u201d\n\nSiteLock noted that Warren \u201crose to the top\u201d of the awareness ranking in large part due to her \u201cadvocacy for stronger cybersecurity practices,\u201d particularly in regards to securing elections.\n\nWarren described U.S. elections in a blog post for Medium in June as \u201cless secure than your Amazon account,\u201d and laid out a plan for overhauling the U.S. voting system in order to heighten security.\n\nBooker also included strengthening election security as part of his national security platform, vowing to \u201cprotect our democracy from foreign interference\u201d if elected. Almost all of the other candidates scored by SiteLock have either prioritized or discussed the need to shore up election security.\n\nSiteLock wrote that Trump would have received a higher grade had Trump International Hotels not been involved in three data breaches between 2016 and 2017 and if cybersecurity was part of his 2020 platform.
