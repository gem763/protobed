Elizabeth Warren once again refused to say whether taxes would rise for middle-class families in order to pay for her preferred vision of expanding the Medicare program to cover all Americans.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cMiddle-class families are going to pay less,\u201d Warren said during the third Democratic debate, hosted by ABC, in Texas on Thursday. \u201cCosts are going to go up for wealthier individuals and giant corporations.\u201d\n\nWarren only referenced total costs, which is what families have to deal with, she said.\n\nWhen asked directly about tax obligations, she once again dodged the question.\n\nWarren supports Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan for a Medicare for All program, which he admitted on Thursday could cost more than $30 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo finance the plan, Sanders has said taxes would rise for the average American family, though he says people would pay less overall thanks to lower health care costs.\n\nHe has estimated that taxes could rise by $10,000 for the average family. He added that a family currently paying $20,000 for private insurance \u2013 in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses \u2013 would see that obligation eliminated. Instead, taxes would increase by $10,000.\n\nUnder his Medicare for All proposal, Americans would lose their private insurance.\n\nSanders unveiled his updated Medicare for All bill in April, which would expand coverage of the government-run program to all Americans, not just those over the age of 65. He pushed a similar proposal in 2017.\n\nSanders and Warren squared off against a number of others on the debate stage on Thursday \u2013 including former Vice President Joe Biden, who does not share their Medicare for All vision.", "description": "Independent Vermont Sen.
