The Canadians themselves are generally well versed in Bitcoin, as at least 85% of residents are aware of it. The only problem may be where to start.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll show you how to buy and sell bitcoin in Canada using different methods.\n\nHow to buy and sell bitcoin in Canada?\n\nThere are four ways how you can buy and sell bitcoin in Canada which include:\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThrough peer-to-peer platforms.\n\nIn person.\n\nUsing Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nLet\u2019s take a brief look at each of these options.\n\n1. Buying and selling bitcoin in Canada using crypto exchanges\n\nUntil the infamous QuadrigaCX scandal, Canada was known as a home to many trustworthy exchanges. Although the unpleasant case has besmirched the country\u2019s crypto industry reputation, there are still services that people can turn to. These include:\n\nCoinbase (accepts credit/debit card payments, bank wire transfers, and cryptocurrencies).\n\nCoinbase Pro (same as Coinbase but for more experienced users)\n\nKraken\n\nChangelly\n\nCoinmama (accepts credit/debit card payments)\n\nBesides, you can try these Canada-based exchanges/services:\n\nCoinsquare\n\nBitbuy\n\nShakepay\n\nMyBTC.ca\n\nCanadian Bitcoins\n\nBitAccess\n\nNDAX\n\nBitvo\n\nMost of these platforms accept e-transfers and bank wires for funding and withdrawal, among other options. Most Canadian Bitcoin services also support Interac e-Transfer, which makes it super easy to fund an exchange account for everyone with a Canadian bank account.\n\nBank wire transfer is another convenient option but mind it takes more time (1-3 days) for the funds to reach your exchange account. Besides, bank wires tend to have minimum funding limit so be sure to check exchange\u2019s terms and conditions regarding user deposits.\n\nPerhaps the most convenient option to purchase bitcoin in Canada is by using a credit card, but it is also the most expensive one. Exchange fee\u2019s for credit card transfers vary from 5% to 10%, so calculate the premium you\u2019re willing to pay beforehand.\n\nCoinsquare exchange.\n\nFor more info on credit card purchases, read our guide \"How to buy Bitcoins with a credit card.\"\n\n2. Buy and sell bitcoin via peer-to-peer platforms\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to use crypto exchanges, you can look for individuals and organizations that buy or sell bitcoin directly. It works like this:\n\nYou register on a platform. You search for a person/organization who wants to buy or sell bitcoin directly using your preferred exchange method (PayPal, bank transfer, face-to-face meeting, etc.) You check their reputation on the platform (don\u2019t deal with untrustworthy accounts who have negative or none reviews). If you deem the account is trustworthy, you text each other and agree on the method of the exchange. You follow your agreement and finalize the deal.\n\nWebsites that allow for such communication to take place are LocalBitcoins, Paxful, and BitKan.\n\nAlternatively to these platforms, you can also try using a decentralized Bitcoin exchange, like BitSquare or Coinffeine. Decentralized exchanges require less communication with the other party, and are super convenient if you prioritize speed, privacy, and anonymity.\n\nBitsquare (Bisq) - a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n3. Buy or sell bitcoin in Canada face-to-face\n\nThe process of buying or selling bitcoin in a face-to-face meeting is like the one using peer-to-peer platforms. You are likely to use the same peer-to-peer platforms like LocalBitcoins or Paxful to find someone who wants to deal with you. The only difference is that instead of making a wire transfer or paying in some other way, you\u2019re arranging a meeting where you exchange bitcoins for cash (or any other mutually agreed payment option).\n\nFace-to-face meetings may sound weird at first, but they are highly popular among people who prioritize their privacy and security.\n\n4. Buying and selling bitcoins in Canada via Bitcoin ATM\u2019s\n\nYou can also use a local Bitcoin ATM, but be warned: they charge high fees. If this is not a problem for you, you can find the closest Bitcoin ATM at websites such as Coinatmradar.com.\n\nFinding a nearby Bitcoin ATM in Canada shouldn\u2019t be too tricky, as Canada has the second largest number of Bitcoin ATM\u2019s worldwide (681 at the time of writing), trailing only behind the United States.\n\nBitcoin ATM's map in Canada.

If you\u2019re using your virtual tokens to pay for goods and services, the rules for barter transactions apply. If, like most people, you\u2019re treating Bitcoin more like gold \u2013 buying it to sell it at a later date for a profit \u2013 you\u2019ll have to declare any capital gains or losses on your tax return.
