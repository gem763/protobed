(Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\n\nWashington Wizards forward Isaac Bonga stretched his long arms to defend an inbounds play Sunday, and moments later he committed his second personal foul in a matter of four seconds.\n\nBefore the game, Justin Anderson neatly folded his clothes and placed them atop white sneakers, but his work attire was bunched on the floor. Anderson doesn\u2019t have a stall inside the home locker room at Capital One Arena, so his No. 7 jersey hung from a lower cabinet drawer.\n\nAdmiral Schofield has his own space, but like all of the young Wizards players, he must abandon it the moment Bradley Beal beckons his crew to pregame chapel.\n\nJordan McRae, given the night off Sunday, never took off his hooded warmup jacket as Washington lost, 115-108, to the Milwaukee Bucks in the second-to-last game on their exhibition schedule.\n\n[The Wizards must transform their defense, and they brought in a coach to do just that]\n\nThese are the four candidates to start at small forward when the Wizards begin the regular season Oct. 23: a second-year player packed with potential but who needs more court time to learn the game, a training-camp invitee who signed a non-guaranteed contract (that doesn\u2019t come with a locker during the preseason), a rookie who has to do what he is told and a veteran accustomed to fighting for a roster spot.\n\nMost of the Wizards\u2019 starting lineup is secured. Beal and Ish Smith are set in the backcourt, and Thomas Bryant and No. 9 draft pick Rui Hachimura, most likely, will anchor the front line. But injuries have eliminated top small forwards Troy Brown Jr. and CJ Miles from the rotation for the foreseeable future, leaving the Wizards with a decision to make ahead of the opener in Dallas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said Friday night in New York. \u201cWe got a lot of guys that are fighting for opportunities and, like I said, it\u2019s not just talk \u2014 it\u2019s wide open. Especially with all of the injuries, it\u2019s really wide open.\u201d\n\nSo open, in fact, that a player who under normal circumstances would have been happy winning the 14th or 15th spot on the roster could become a starter.\n\nAnderson earned the attention of Wizards General Manager Tommy Sheppard in workouts over the summer and signed a one-year deal to compete for a roster spot. But like any player without a guaranteed contract, he could be waived by Oct. 21. Anderson, a 2015 first-round draft pick, can help as an athletic defender and floor-spacing wing, but he said he has not focused on the possibility of becoming a Day 1 starter.\n\n\u201cObviously, it would be great to be a starter. Obviously, I feel like I can really help this team,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut as far as the race, I kind of have tunnel vision. I don\u2019t want to look to the left or to the right of me. I know Usain Bolt, he looks to the left of him because he knows he\u2019s so much far ahead of everybody, but my thing is I want to put myself in a position to not look back.\u201d\n\n[At Wizards camp, a lot of talk about a \u2018new mind-set\u2019 and changing team\u2019s direction]\n\nThe Wizards converted McRae\u2019s two-way contract to a standard deal in April, but his salary will not become fully guaranteed until Dec. 20. McRae is no stranger to this precarious scenario. While he was with Cleveland during the 2016-17 season, his contract did not become guaranteed until January. And last season in the Wizards\u2019 organization, McRae spent the majority of the year dominating G League defenses by averaging 30.4 points and only playing significant NBA minutes near the end of the campaign.\n\nAgainst the Knicks on Friday, McRae made his best argument for starting when he hit his first six shots and finished with 15 points in a 115-99 win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve honestly been in these situations since I\u2019ve been in the league,\u201d McRae said. \u201cSo not that you want to get comfortable getting used to it, but I\u2019ve been in it before so I already kind of know what to expect.\u201d\n\nIf the Wizards truly want to lean into their youth movement \u2014 and live with the shaky results \u2014 then Bonga or Schofield could get consideration for the starting spot. The players\u2019 vast potential, however, may not be enough to prove they are ready for the assignment.\n\nThe physical possibilities for Bonga, whose 7-foot wingspan enticed the Los Angeles Lakers to trade for him on draft night a year ago, are impressive. With his 6-8 frame, he can play the wing and potentially make plays as a big point guard. He is also light enough on his feet to be active on the defensive end. But Bonga logged only 22 games in the NBA during his rookie season with the Lakers, so his experience is limited.\n\nBonga started Sunday night against the Bucks but picked up those two fouls within four seconds in the first four minutes. With 8:20 remaining in the third quarter, Bonga, who did not practice during the opening days of training camp because of knee soreness, needed help leaving the court. The team later announced he had suffered a left ankle strain, and he did not return. Bonga finished the game scoreless with one rebound and one assist in 16 minutes.\n\n\u201cI think he has a pretty good feel for the game,\u201d Brooks said recently. \u201cHe needs some experience. These are great opportunities for him to get some experience, especially since we have a lot of guys that are out.\u201d\n\nSchofield filled in for Bonga in the second half Sunday and showed off his range by making an open corner three. But Schofield, a muscular, 6-4 wing, concentrated more on the defensive end. He matched up at times against a similarly built player in Thanasis Antetokounmpo and tried to stop his free movement.\n\nThe Wizards ultimately received little offensive production from the small forward spot: Anderson and Schofield finished with five points each on a combined 3-for-7 shooting. Just one preseason game remains Friday in Philadelphia, and the four-man race for the small forward starting job continues.\n\n\u201cIt literally feels like I\u2019m waiting for a middle school tryout to see if my name is on the list,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m just locked in, trying to get a locker. It\u2019s a brand new situation for me. I don\u2019t want any sympathy. I don\u2019t want any handouts. I want to earn everything. I\u2019m not used to any other way.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAs NBA-China controversy continues, \u2018Free Hong Kong\u2019 protesters demonstrate at Wizards\u2019 exhibition\n\nWizards rookie Rui Hachimura looks like a \u2018wise veteran\u2019 in first preseason game\n\nThe Wizards want more Thomas Bryants", "description": "Isaac Bonga, Justin Anderson, Admiral Schofield and Jordan McRae are all in the mix to start at the No. 3 spot on opening night.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards.", "October At Pm", "Candace Buckner Covers The Washington Wizards.
