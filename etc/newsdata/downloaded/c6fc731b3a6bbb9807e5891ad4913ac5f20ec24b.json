For more details about the Disney\u2019s technology, check out the footage in the video section above or head to this page.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the entertainment giant has toyed with robots.\n\nDisney has previously showcased robotics research implementations that focused on ultra-realistic Avatar-themed animatronics and a one-legged hopping robot reminiscent of Tigger.\n\nRead next: UK judge slams Craig Wright's defamation case against Roger Ver", "description": "Researchers from Disney have developed anti-vibration software for mapping CGI movements to actual robots in the physical world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F07%2Fdisney-research-robot-ai-vibration.jpg&signature=d4bfadc670bc5d4bb8dd2008a3c58f50", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
