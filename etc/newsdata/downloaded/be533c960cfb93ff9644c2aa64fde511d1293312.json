Wow.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign communications director, Lily Adams, responded by telling CNN that the accusations were similar to those President Obama faced when many claimed he was not born in America. According to the New York Times, Trump Jr. deleted the tweet and his spokesperson told the outlet it was a misunderstanding.\n\nThis month, according to CNN, Harris sought to have President Trump suspended from Twitter for trying to \"target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower\" who made controversial claims about a phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.
