I told my wife that they were not beating me that day, even though I had never won a NASCAR Cup race. Nobody had ever lost 462 races and then just won,\u201d Waltrip told Fox News. \u201cBut Dale Earnhardt Sr. had told me I had the ability, and that day, I knew I would.\u201d\n\nAt that point in his tumultuous career, Waltrip had completed some 462 Cup races \u2013 and failed to cross the line first in each and every one of them \u2013 branding him with the gong of NASCAR\u2019s longest-ever losing streak. But under the Florida sun on the legendary racetrack, Earnhardt blocked the field of 40 cars to allow Waltrip a much-coveted victory.\n\n\u201cWith 30 laps to go, I took the lead for the first time. Behind me was his son Dale Earnhardt Jr., and behind him was Dale Sr., the three of us working together,\u201d Waltrip recalled. \u201cAnd then crossing the line and taking that checkered flag \u2013 the emotion I felt was relief.\u201d\n\nBRIAN BANKS BIOPIC PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON FALSE RAPE ALLEGATIONS AND THE LIVES IT DESTROYS\n\nIt was a unique friendship amid the vicious arena of professional racecar driving. The celebration would be short-lived. Earnhardt Sr. crashed on the last lap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian and I believe in angels and God. I believe those angels took me straight to Victory Lane and I didn\u2019t stop at the crash. I was waiting for Dale to walk through the gate but he didn\u2019t. I knew something was wrong,\u201d Waltrip said. \u201cNo one had answers. Half an hour later, my publicist delivered me the ultimate news.\u201d\n\nWaltrip\u2019s story and his bond as the chronic underdog with the feared and famed Earnhardt -- known in the sport as \u201cThe Intimidator\u201d -- is the subject of a new documentary, \u201cBlink of an Eye,\u201d directed by Paul Taublieb.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this to be just a race car movie, it\u2019s a movie about what happens when somebody really believes in you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an untold story, a marvelous story. Dale Earnhardt Sr. was the Michael Jordan or the Brad Pitt of the racecar world. When you deal with a real person and their family, there is a sense of responsibility.\u201d\n\n'LAND OF THE LOST' STAR KATHY COLEMAN RECALLS GETTING INTO TROUBLE ON SET, REVEALS WHY HIT SHOW CAME TO AN END\n\nAnd while Earnhardt was a deeply private person, Taublieb hopes audiences see the many layers beneath his exterior as a ruthless competitor staring down the finish line.\n\n\u201cDale had a heart of gold and truly cared about other people,\u201d he surmised. \u201cAnd Michael taught me as a filmmaker to own your emotions, be raw and share who you are. Some might think he was a loser, but he definitely was not.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd for Waltrip, telling his story is a catharsis bound by faith and belief in overcoming adversity.\n\n\u201cFor a few months after that Daytona, I was just going through the motions,\u201d he added. \u201cThen I came out of it, and I went back to Daytona to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlink of an Eye\u201d opens in New York and Los Angeles September 6th, and for one day only in select cinemas nationwide on September 12th in partnership with Fathom Events", "description": "Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr. recount the tragic event in new film.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
