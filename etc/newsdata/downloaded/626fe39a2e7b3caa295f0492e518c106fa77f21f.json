Statements released today by Museum of the Bible and the Egypt Exploration Society reveal that the Mark fragment was just the beginning of the scandal. Investigations have revealed that (so far) 13 pieces in the Museum\u2019s collection are in fact the rightful property of the Oxford-based non-profit Egypt Exploration Society.\n\nThe artifacts in question are all Bible and Bible-related fragments; 12 were written on papyrus and one on parchment. In other words, just the kinds of things that fit the Green Family and Museum of the Bible\u2019s interests. They are part of the Oxyrhynchus Collection, a vast collection of fragments from ancient trash-piles in the city of Oxyrhynchus (modern Al-Bahnasa) in Egypt. The collection was excavated in the late 19th to early 20th centuries and most of it is now the property of the Egypt Exploration Society, which acts as curator of an Oxford-based collection.\n\nAll of which raises the question: how did a U.S.-based company and, later, museum come to be in possession of these ancient Egyptian artifacts? According to the EES statement, they \u201cwere taken without authorization from the EES \u2026 Eleven of these pieces came into [Museum of the Bible\u2019s] care after being sold to Hobby Lobby Stores by Professor [Dirk] Obbink, most of them in two batches in 2010.\u201d The Museum of the Bible\u2019s statement more directly confirms that the antiquities were \u201csold illegally\u201d by a \u201cknown expert.\u201d A spokesperson for Museum of the Bible further clarified to The Daily Beast, that of these 13 items, only four are the property of the museum, with the remainder belonging to Hobby Lobby as part of the Green Collection.\n\nBoth the EES and the University of Oxford confirmed that Obbink is \u201cunder investigation \u2026 [for] the removal and alleged sale of EES texts.\u201d In the meantime, the University of Oxford confirmed that Obbink continues to be employed there. The university was unable to comment on whether or not Scotland Yard are involved.\n\nOf the 13 illicit Oxyrhynchus items currently in Museum of the Bible\u2019s collection, two were sold by another buyer. In an online comment Mike Holmes, who heads up Museum of the Bible\u2019s Scholar\u2019s Initiative, stated that the second buyer was \u201c Khader M. Baidun & Sons/Art-Levant Antiquities of Israel. The exact circumstances of how those two items moved from Oxford to Israel are unknown to\u201d the Museum of the Bible. Both the Green family and Obbink had ties to the Baidun family. Obbink once jointly owned an antiquities company called \u201cCastle Folio\u201d with a man named Mahmoud Elder who, in turn, served as an officer for another company with Alan Baidun. Additionally, a member of the Baidun family was arrested in Israel in 2017 following investigations into a separate antiquities smuggling scandal involving Hobby Lobby. As revealed by The Daily Beast in 2015, Hobby Lobby was subject to a federal investigation for illegally importing illicit antiquities in 2011. The case was settled in 2017.\n\nBy cooperating with the EES and helping to facilitate the return of the stolen items there\u2019s no question that Museum of the Bible is doing the right thing here. But there are still questions about how something like this happened in the first place. The EES notes in their statement that in most cases, not only was the item itself taken, but the identifying card catalogue and photograph were also missing. It was only because the EES had back-up records that they were able to identify the missing unpublished texts. In response to the statements, noted New Testament scholar and papyrologist Brent Nongbri writes on his blog that \u201c The sale of the manuscripts and the attempt to cover it up by removing records is almost unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of the buyer, in this case Hobby Lobby. The invoice released by Museum of the Bible in June says nothing about the origins of the papyrus fragment other than just \u201cEgypt.\u201d This is legally insufficient. There should be an export date, supporting documentation, and a history of ownership. An enquiry from The Daily Beast to Hobby Lobby, last June, asking for additional provenance details for the sale did not receive any response. The Museum of the Bible, for its part, is not entirely in the clear: any museum accepting donations or loans to its collection should ask for full documentation of the legal status of the item.\n\nObbink did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Daily Beast but 18 months ago, in a brief response to emails, he stated that any story that he tried to sell a fragment of the Gospel of Mark to the Green family \u201cis not true.\u201d\n\nIf the allegations are true, they reveal a perfect storm of complicity between seller, buyer, and institution in which an unscrupulous academic was able to remove and sell valuable historical artifacts; a buyer was willing to look the other way on questions of provenance and legitimate ownership; and a museum failed to do due diligence when accepting donations.\n\nNongbri added that this may be a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d about academic superstars like Obbink. \u201cThere seems to have been very little oversight of Dirk Obbink by Oxford, the AHRC, the EES, or anyone else before this scandal broke\u2026 the EES has admitted that Dirk Obbink was keeping papyri in his personal office (allegedly the place where he was also peddling manuscripts). Even \u2018geniuses\u2019 need oversight.\u201d\n\nAs for Museum of the Bible, which is legally distinct from Hobby Lobby and was not involved in the purchase of these papyri, it\u2019s unclear what the fallout will be. Jill Hicks-Keeton, assistant professor of religious studies at Oklahoma University and co-editor of The Museum of the Bible: A Critical Introduction, told me \u201cThis is bad news [for Museum of the Bible] \u2013 worse for Obbink, whose scholarly credentials are often raised by MOTB advocates as evidence of the museum\u2019s legitimacy. The disgrace of Obbink should raise serious questions in all of our minds about the Museum of the Bible. Chief among mine is why its Director of the Scholars Initiative is releasing the evidence. If the Museum of the Bible will use this news to publicly distance itself from the scandal, we should be wary. Steve Green is still its board chair\u2026Is the Museum really distancing itself from its past and charting a new course, or merely coming clean about some scandals to give the appearance of reform?\u201d\n\nFor the field of papyrology this may be a moment of reckoning. One of their most distinguished luminaries\u2014a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d winner, no less\u2014is alleged to have sold antiquities that he did not own. When I spoke to Nongbri in June he told me \u201cIf this isn\u2019t a one-off thing, and there are more records of sales, it becomes harder to believe that other scholars who work closely with Dirk Obbink didn\u2019t know this kind of thing was going on.\u201d The scale of the problem, as Nongbri notes, is still undetermined. If items were illicitly leaving the Oxyrhynchus collection and being funneled through Baidun it\u2019s possible that other items (and indeed dealers) are involved. Perhaps this is the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019s also possible that other Oxyrhynchus papyri were sold to different U.S. buyers. Regardless of the scale of the problem, the fact that items could leave the collection at all demonstrates that there is a need for greater transparency in the administration of shared intellectual and cultural heritage.", "description": "The Museum of the Bible revealed today that at least 13 Biblical fragments in its collection were illicitly sold by a Oxford professor to Hobby Lobby's Green family.", "authors": ["Candida Moss"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571088005/GettyImages-874207562_lkr7fc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
