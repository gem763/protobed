Adam Schiff, told reporters that Democrats were bound and determined to pass gun control legislation, regardless of how long it takes, regardless of what else is taking place in the political world, regardless of how many stones Second Amendment supporters throw into the way.\n\nTake this as a threat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going away until we get legislation signed into law that protects our children,\u201d she said in a brief video posted by The Hill.\n\nHer determination shouldn\u2019t be dismissed.\n\nIn between all the whistleblowing-slash-Ukraine-slash-impeachment brouhaha brewing and bustling about Capitol Hill, remember: Pelosi is the one who kept up the fight for Obamacare, when most others thought it was a dead deal.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s Fight: How She Revived Obamacare After Democrats Left It For Dead,\u201d The Intercept wrote in November of 2018.\n\n\u201cIt is dangerous to underestimate Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Anne-Marie Slaughter wrote in a piece for the Financial Times in June.\n\nQuite right.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Pelosi is particularly skilled with people, or that she\u2019s got a diplomatic touch that rivals Midas\u2019 in terms of turning sour grapes to gold.\n\nIt\u2019s that she\u2019s been so long on Capitol Hill that she knows where all the bodies are buried.\n\nShe was first elected to Congress in 1987 \u2014 and if you think a woman rises to the top of legislative power, where no other woman in U.S. legislative history has gone before, without trading a few favors for favors, without greasing a few palms, without becoming schooled in the art of strongarm politicking, well then, take this left-handed wrench. Go trade it for a right-handed ratchet.\n\nIn other words: You\u2019re a fool.\n\nPelosi is a long-time politician because she\u2019s learned how to play the political game.\n\nShe\u2019s maintained leadership of the Democratic Party in the House because she\u2019s learned how to offer carrots and apply sticks with equal skill.\n\nAnd she\u2019s done it all, seemingly, absent the burden of conscience and soul.\n\nOn Sept. 29, she tweeted: \u201cThis week, in addition to officially launching a formal impeachment inquiry into @realDonaldTrump\u2019s abuses of power, we continued the fight to #EndGunViolence and met \u2026 to discuss the #EqualityAct.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Pelosi also tweeted: \u201c@SenateMajLdr McConnell seems to think he can wait out the calls for him to bring up background check legislation. He\u2019s wrong \u2014 we aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nBelieve her.\n\nPelosi, along with her fellow anti-Second Amendment leftist-leaning zealots, aren\u2019t going anywhere at all.\n\nThe fight for law-abiding Americans to maintain their God-given rights to self-defend, via the Second Amendment, isn\u2019t going to end any time soon. Forewarned is forearmed.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
