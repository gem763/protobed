REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nThe warning, announced late Thursday, came as the bank\u2019s supervisory board approved plans announced last week to cut thousands of staff and close a fifth of branches following a failed merger with bigger rival Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).\n\nCommerzbank, part owned by the German government after a bailout, has been struggling for years with a legacy of bad debts, high costs and fines, and tough trading conditions have hampered its recovery efforts.\n\n\u201cNegative interest rates, increasing regulation, a weaker economy and tough competition ... The challenges facing banks are enormous,\u201d Zielke said.\n\nOutgoing finance chief Stephan Engels added the latest loosening of policy by the European Central Bank \u201cwill not make our lives easier\u201d, and that a programme designed to cushion the blow for banks would not fully compensate.\n\nCommerzbank shares were down 1.2% at 0735 GMT.\n\nThe bank said on Thursday that board member Bettina Orlopp would succeed Engels as chief financial officer, while Sabine Schmittroth would become board member for human resources.\n\n\u201cOver the course of 2019, the market environment has continued to deteriorate further. This has been particularly evident in the corporate clients business,\u201d it said, explaining the downgrade in its revenue expectations.\n\nThe supervisory board also approved plans to sell a stake in the bank\u2019s Polish subsidiary mBank (MBK.WA) and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.\n\nThe lender flagged the strategic overhaul last week.\n\nThe measures were approved by the board during a two-day meeting.\n\nAmong the plans, the bank will cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in \u201cstrategic areas\u201d, so the group headcount will fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce.\n\nThe mBank sale will further reduce staff levels. Headcount will fall to 29,300, a spokesman said. The company now employs about 40,700 people.\n\nCommerzbank said the strategy would involve investment of 1.6 billion euros (\u00a31.4 billion), with 750 million euros going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.\n\nThe restructuring plan is negative for the German lender\u2019s credit rating, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has said.\n\nThe agency said plans to sell mBank would \u201cfurther limit the bank\u2019s growth potential given that mBank meaningfully contributed to the group\u2019s revenue and profits, and its growth\u201d.", "description": "The challenges facing banks are \"enormous\", Commerzbank Chief Executive Martin Zielke said on Friday, after the German lender said it no longer expected a rise in underlying revenues this year.", "authors": ["Tom Sims", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434232119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1P0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
