Take a deep breath before engaging.", "language": "en", "text": "So when discount broker Charles Schwab scrapped the $4.95 commission on all online trades, as a buy-and-hold investor I immediately thought, \u201cBad idea.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause anything that encourages more trading could induce nonprofessionals like myself to buy and sell more stocks. That\u2019s a loser\u2019s game. I can\u2019t compete with the professional investors who work for institutions such as mutual funds, foundations, companies and universities. Those really smart professionals, known as institutional investors, pound away all day on their computer screens, trying to make a profit on massive trades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd even those people aren\u2019t successful all the time. That stacks high odds against nonprofessionals like myself being able to pick stock market winners.\n\n\u201cYou will lose more money trading than you will save by not paying any transaction costs,\u201d said Daniel P. Wiener, chairman of Adviser Investments, based in Newton, Mass. \u201cMost investors trade poorly. They tend to buy high and sell low. The best investors and the names that everyone knows in the investment markets are people who do their research, make their purchases and stick with them.\u201d\n\nThat said, even Warren Buffett, Ken Langone, Carl Icahn, George Soros and others go through rough patches and lose money on investments.\n\nAD\n\nNo one I spoke to thought Schwab\u2019s move was a bad thing. It\u2019s one of the discount brokers like TD Ameritrade, ETrade and Interactive Brokers who have helped drive down brokerage fees and democratize the stock market for all.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of investors are going to benefit from lower commissions,\u201d Odean said. \u201cI am not coming out against lower commissions. But there will be a minority that will likely trade more than they would otherwise.\u201d\n\nSchwab is part of a trend adopted by Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and the discount stock brokerage houses as they drive commissions and fees toward zero to compete for market share.\n\n\u201cI see this more as a change in the business model for online brokers than I do as a change in investor habits,\u201d said Fritz Gilbert, who writes a blog called the Retirement Manifesto.\n\nAD\n\nSchwab\u2019s revenue from commissions on securities trading represents only 6.7 percent of its $10 billion-plus in revenue. The brokerage is also a bank, and it makes most of its money \u2014 around 57 percent \u2014 from interest on the uninvested cash that people leave in their accounts. Schwab invests that money at a higher return than it pays out to its clients.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSchwab is making money,\u201d said Kenny Polcari of SlateStone Wealth. \u201cTrading feels free to you, but you are generating plenty of money to Schwab.\u201d\n\nSchwab also makes money on selling advice to investors and on proprietary fees it charges on its in-house exchange traded funds and mutual funds. The company is betting that eliminating commissions will attract more customers who will become clients of its services.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a classic, \u2018Put up a poster in the window saying you have a gallon of milk you are selling in the back of the store for $2.99,\u2019 \u201d said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. \u201cThe owner is betting you buy a bag of Cheetos, some bread and bubble gum on the way to getting the milk and coming back up front.\u201d\n\nJohnson said reducing the trade commissions is not going to change investor behavior.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThose previously inclined to trade are not going to trade any less,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThose who did not trade are not going to wake up the next morning and start being day traders.\u201d\n\nI am somewhere in between. First of all, I do not have an issue with Schwab or its brethren in the money management business earning a profit. I do not want to go back to the cumbersome days when you bought stocks through a stockbroker.\n\nAD\n\nBut I also hope people don\u2019t think that because trading is free, they should jump on the computer and punch in a trade on a whiff of emotion or a tip from their Uber driver.\n\nOdean doesn\u2019t have a problem with people trading when they need to convert an asset into cash, such as selling stock shares to pay for a child\u2019s college tuition. But his studies in the past cast doubt on the ability of individual traders like me to distinguish between future winners and losers.\n\nAD\n\nIf the study were run today, Odean said, \u201cthe market might be a little more efficient, creating a little less of an opportunity to shoot yourself in the foot. That said . . . there is still an opportunity for people to win and lose, and on average the institutional investors win more often than individuals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMy own experience at picking winners and losers is not great. I bought a dozen stocks including General Electric, Alcoa and McDonald\u2019s decades ago. I took a bath on GE and Alcoa, and I sold McDonald\u2019s more than 10 years ago. McDonald\u2019s has been on a rocket in the last few years, causing me much regret over selling the fast-food giant.\n\nMy other stocks have done fine, mostly thanks to my wife\u2019s suggestions. If you are dying to own individual stocks, most professional advice is to own a diverse group of established companies in different industries. That would include financials, energy, technology, health care, utilities and consumer staples. Then hold those stocks and reinvest the dividends.\n\nAD\n\nSchwab doesn\u2019t disagree.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long advocated a \u2018core and explore\u2019 approach,\u201d said Alison Wertheim, Schwab\u2019s vice president for public relations. \u201cBut investing for the long-term, by establishing a low-cost, diversified portfolio that takes on less risk, should be the foundation for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people, if they do some research, should assemble a portfolio of a dozen stocks, with an average holding period of at least a year and, ideally, a number of years,\u201d said Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund manager who writes an investment newsletter.\n\nThat\u2019s what I did about 25 years ago. It isn\u2019t perfect, but it can work for you.\n\nBut there is also no shame in simply owning an index fund and letting it do the work.\n\nOr as Odean advises, just sit tight.\n\n\u201cETrade use to run an ad that said, \u2018It\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning and you want to place a trade for a fast-moving stock without waking your baby or your broker. It\u2019s time for ETrade.\u2019 \u201d Odean recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018It\u2019s time to go back to sleep.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD", "description": "As financial houses like Charles Schwab and ETrade race to zero fees, would-be day traders need to weigh the odds and proceed with caution.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M3qSR9G9PbN9ClndLjP3yYwBsW8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUJ7S7XV2II6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
