The only problem? There may not be much new for Google to show, given everything that\u2019s already leaked.\n\nWhen we first published this roundup in September, we thought we knew a lot. We\u2019d already seen multiple hands-on videos of actual Pixel 4 XL that showed off three colors, its dual cameras, and gave us a pretty good idea of its specs. And earlier this year, Google itself got in on the action: it mic dropped the back of the phone and revealed the Pixel 4 would have both a Face ID competitor and built-in radar for air gestures. But it turns out even that was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nSo what\u2019s new? We may have now seen the smaller Pixel 4 as well, plus the official spec sheet for both new phones. It also seems as if the Pixel 4 might give you dual exposure controls right from the camera viewfinder. That face unlock feature? Looks to be pretty speedy in practice. And, oh yeah, Pikachu might teach how you to use those air gestures. And that\u2019s just the start.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already read this gigantic post once, settle in with some coffee to read it again \u2014 we\u2019ve added lots of new info about what to expect from the Pixel 4. We\u2019re collecting every single credible leak so you don\u2019t have to hunt them down yourself. And keep checking back, because we\u2019ll be updating this as we find even more.\n\nIndustrial Design\n\nWhat we know: It\u2019s got a big camera square around back, a huge top bezel up front to house all its sensors, and a prominent black band around the sides.\n\nWhat we think we know: Thanks to an unprecedented number of leaks, we can show you what appears to be the Pixel 4 XL from practically every angle.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: The fingerprint reader. Is there one?\n\nThe industrial design for the Pixel 4 isn\u2019t much of a mystery because Google showed us a preview back in June:\n\nWell, since there seems to be some interest, here you go! Wait 'til you see what it can do. #Pixel4 pic.twitter.com/RnpTNZXEI1 \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) June 12, 2019\n\nRight away, we can tell Google has moved away from its previous Pixel design language. The two-tone matte glass back is gone, replaced with a sleeker monolithic design with no fingerprint divot \u2014 almost like an iPhone. And that\u2019s before we consider that it\u2019s got an iPhone 11-like camera square: a prominent rounded square housing at the top left of the device with at least two prominent cameras inside.\n\nHere\u2019s what today\u2019s Pixel 3 looks like, for comparison\u2019s sake:\n\nGoogle also showed us that the top of the phone will have a large bezel to house a bunch of sensors we\u2019ll discuss later. For now, know that Google appears to be moving away from the massive, ugly notch on the Pixel 3 XL.\n\nThat\u2019s all Google has officially shared about design, but there\u2019s a lot more we can show you, thanks to many leaks.\n\nWhen we first published this post, we had only seen the Pixel 4 XL, but now we have an idea of what the smaller Pixel 4 looks like, too, thanks to what appears to be an official render of the Pixel 4 in black from serial phone leaker Evan Blass:\n\nAnd, in September, The Verge obtained no fewer than 21 photos of what\u2019s purportedly an unreleased Pixel 4 XL (though, apparently, it\u2019s not a final unit), giving us another look at the entire front and back as well as a close-up of that camera square:\n\nIf you want a better look at the sides and bottom of the phone, look no further than Vietnamese site GenK:\n\nThis industrial design is also corroborated by many leaked videos from people who\u2019ve touched the phone, and even by what appears to be a Google-made ad:\n\nAccording to people who\u2019ve touched early units, both the rear cover glass and the outer band have a textured matte finish that resists fingerprints and sweat.\n\nColors\n\nWhat we know: The Pixel 4 will come in black and orange.\n\nWhat we think we know: There may be a white model.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: Other possible colors.\n\nGoogle apparently can\u2019t wait to show off the colors of the Pixel 4, as it has already shared two of them: the first tweet about the Pixel 4 revealed a sleek black, and an official Google ad in Times Square revealed a brand-new orange.\n\nAnd recently, serial phone leaker Evan Blass not only shared that official-looking render of the black Pixel 4, but also official-looking renders of the Pixel 4 XL in white and orange. And it seems they\u2019ll have typically Google-y names \u2014 the colors will apparently be referred to as \u201cJust Black,\u201d \u201cClearly White\u201d and \u201cOh So Orange,\u201d according to 9to5Google.\n\nHere\u2019s the whole alleged lineup in-person:\n\nLike earlier Pixels, each appears to have a colorful power button as an accent, with the black and orange phones offering a white button and the white phone sporting an orange button. We can also see that the camera bump stays black on all three phones \u2014 as opposed to the iPhone 11, where Apple mills it right out of the same piece of colored glass.\n\nA \u201cmint green\u201d version of the Pixel 4 might also be on the way, Indiashopps.com reported in June, but we haven\u2019t seen it in any of the leaked videos or photos of the Pixel 4 XL so far. There\u2019s a chance it could be just for the smaller Pixel 4, since we haven\u2019t seen many leaks of that yet. But given that Google has used the same colors across both smaller and larger models of previous Pixels, it seems less likely.\n\nSpecs and what\u2019s in the box\n\nWhat we know: Not much.\n\nWhat we think we know: CPU, RAM, battery size, screen resolution, and storage sizes for both Pixel 4 models, and that a new \u201cPixel Neural Core\u201d chip may replace the Pixel 3\u2019s Visual Core chip.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: If a leaked spec sheet is accurate, we know just about everything.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t shared any hardware specs for the Pixel 4 yet. But based on the flood of leaks, we think we can expect some nice but incremental upgrades from the Pixel 3 and one big upgrade we\u2019ll discuss later. Here\u2019s what looks to be the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL\u2019s official spec sheet, via 9to5Google:\n\nToday\u2019s flagship Android phones like the Galaxy Note 10 almost always use Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 855 processor, so that\u2019s just playing catch-up. But it should be a decent boost over last year\u2019s Snapdragon 845. The bigger change might be the RAM: if true, it\u2019s a 2GB jump from the Pixel 3 to the Pixel 4. And the smaller Pixel 4 may get a slightly larger screen at 5.7 inches, up from 5.5 inches on the Pixel 3.\n\nOne intriguing addition? It seems the Pixel 4 will also have a \u201cPixel Neural Core\u201d chip, which will probably replace the image-processing Pixel Visual Core chip found in the Pixel 3.\n\nHere are some screenshots from our tipster that seem to corroborate what\u2019s inside the larger Pixel 4 XL, including a screen resolution of 3040 x 1440 (leaks haven\u2019t shown us what the smaller Pixel 4\u2019s resolution might be):\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s what apparently comes in the box with the Pixel 4 in the US, again via 9to5Google:\n\nThis list seems to confirm that the Pixel 4 won\u2019t come with USB-C headphones nor an adapter, so if you want to listen to music, you\u2019ll need to provide your own or go down the Bluetooth headphone path. But if you\u2019ve been waiting to spring for Bluetooth headphones until a new generation of 2017\u2019s fiddly Pixel Buds, you might be in luck \u2014 Google may announce a second generation of its Bluetooth Pixel Buds soon, according to 9to5Google.\n\nA speedier screen\n\nWhat we know: Nothing. Google hasn\u2019t said anything about the Pixel 4\u2019s display.\n\nWhat we think we know: The Pixel 4 might feel smoother to use because it may have a 90Hz variable refresh rate display.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: How much a variable refresh display might drain the battery.\n\nThat key new hardware feature we mentioned in the specs section? Not only does Google\u2019s spec sheet mention that the Pixel 4 may have a 90Hz variable refresh rate screen, we\u2019ve seen it in action in several leaked videos. It could make scrolling around the phone feel a lot nicer, much like the buttery smooth screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro.\n\nThere's even a menu setting for the so-called \u201cSmooth Display\u201d in the supposed Pixel 4 XL\u2019s settings menu, according to photos like this one from GenK:\n\nAnd here\u2019s a video of the supposed Pixel 4 XL's screen in action, including on-device gameplay footage of PUBG Mobile:\n\nGoogle's leaked setting suggests the higher refresh rate might have an impact on battery life, though. While The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn still saw the 90Hz OnePlus 7 Pro easily last a full day in his review, it has an even larger 4,000mAh battery, and we've definitely seen the 120Hz Razer Phone last longer with the refresh rate turned down.\n\nNextrift, in a hands-on with what appears to be a Google Pixel 4 XL, found that when Smooth Display is switched on, the display\u2019s refresh rate appeared to be \u201clocked\u201d at 90Hz. It speculated that the refresh rate would dip to 60Hz only if an app didn\u2019t support the faster refresh rate.\n\nHello, telephoto\n\nWhat we know: The Pixel is no longer a single-camera phone. There'll be at least two main cameras around back. No more wide-angle front-facing camera, though.\n\nWhat we think we know: That second camera has a telephoto lens capable of up to 8x digital (not optical) zoom, and the Pixel 4\u2019s camera software might let you change exposure through the viewfinder. The Pixel 4 might also have a new astrophotography mode and a mode for capturing quick action shots.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: The full extent of the Pixel\u2019s camera software upgrades.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has now surpassed the Pixel 3\u2019s single camera in image quality, but the Pixel 4 may be bringing another sensor: a second 16-megapixel camera with a telephoto lens, according to data found in the Google Camera app by 9to5Google.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know its focal length or everything it can do, leaked photos suggest you might be able to zoom up to 8x with the new Pixel phones using what\u2019s likely a combination of optical and digital zoom.\n\nOtherwise, the Pixel 4 seems to be sticking with a 12.2-megapixel main camera \u2014 a tried-and-true resolution for phones specializing in low-light images, typically by using larger pixels instead of cramming more of them into the same space \u2014 but now with a slightly faster f/1.73 aperture that should let in a little bit more light than the previous f/1.8 lens.\n\nHere are some portrait-style photos apparently from the Pixel 4 that 9to5Google says Google may use to promote the new phone. (The photo of the dog is particularly striking.)\n\nHere\u2019s a few more of those apparent official marketing photos, including some that appear to have Night Sight turned on, also from 9to5Google:\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven non-marketing photos that appear to be from the Pixel 4 look sharp \u2014 check out these from Nextrift, which says it took the photos on the left with a Pixel 4 XL and the photos on the right from a Galaxy S10 Plus. The Pixel 4 XL holds up:\n\nBeyond taking detailed photos, what else can those cameras actually do? Well, XDA Developers got its hands on an early build of the Google Camera app from one of those phones, and it confirmed both a \u201cMotion Mode\u201d for capturing action shots, and a new astrophotography mode that had previously been rumored. (That Google-made ad? It shows off astrophotography, too.)\n\nThe redesigned camera interface looks organized and pretty easy to use, putting lots of options within easy reach without cluttering up the screen too much:\n\nIf you want to take better photos of people in action, such as when they\u2019re playing sports, the new \u201cMotion Mode\u201d might help. But we haven\u2019t seen any photos taken with the mode, so it\u2019s not quite clear how well it might work.\n\nAnd that astrophotography mode? The cache of Pixel 4 photos obtained by 9to5Google also has photos that appear to be taken using the new mode \u2014 have a look for yourself:\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these two modes are just the start. There\u2019s always the chance that Google has kept a brand-new camera feature under wraps that blows our minds as much as Night Sight did.\n\nOne potentially cool addition to the Pixel 4\u2019s viewfinder that\u2019s not shown above is the ability to manually manipulate the exposure of highlights and shadows in your image, as shown in what appears to be an official Google marketing video of the feature obtained by 9to5Google. This feature honestly looks pretty wild, and very useful:\n\nOne other note on cameras: the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s extremely busy front bezel no longer includes a wide-angle selfie camera. Now, we appear to be looking at a single 8-megapixel front-facing cam with an aperture of f/2.\n\nFace ID has competition\n\nWhat we know: Google officially says you'll be able to unlock your phone with your face, like Apple\u2019s Face ID.\n\nWhat we think we know: The setup process looks very similar to Apple's.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: How well the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock actually works.\n\nThose new rear cameras aren't the only image sensors on the Pixel 4. It's also got an entire Microsoft Kinect\u2019s worth of infrared cameras and projectors powering an all-new face unlock system, according to Google's blog post.\n\nCheck out this GIF below to see how it works. See if you can spot the important difference from Apple's Face ID:\n\nSee it? The Pixel 4 won\u2019t make you swipe up to unlock your phone after a face is detected, potentially saving you thousands of future thumb swipes. Your thumb may thank you.\n\nIn its blog, Google shares a few more neat details about how it all works:\n\nAs you reach for Pixel 4, Soli proactively turns on the face unlock sensors, recognizing that you may want to unlock your phone. If the face unlock sensors and algorithms recognize you, the phone will open as you pick it up, all in one motion.\n\nWhat's Soli? More on that in a sec.\n\nGoogle also says the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock will work at \u201calmost\u201d any orientation. If true, it could be another improvement on Apple\u2019s Face ID, which previously only worked when your phone was in portrait.\n\nLike Apple, Google says it\u2019s not storing your face in the cloud. The company says all of the facial recognition processing is done on-device.\n\nAnd, Google says face recognition can be used for payments, too, like Face ID. If you want to see how that works, here\u2019s what looks to be an official Google video of the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock being used to buy Monument Valley 2 on the Play Store, via XDA Developers:\n\nIt also looks like you\u2019ll set up the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock system just as easily as Face ID. Here's the similar head roll you'll do to train it, according to a GIF posted by GenK:\n\nNextrift posted a Pixel 4 XL hands-on video that showed more of the face unlock setup process. (They had the \u201cuse accessibility face unlock\u201d option checked, which doesn\u2019t seem to require rotating your head to set up face unlock.)\n\nNextrift said that \u201ca quick glance\u201d was all that was needed to unlock their Pixel 4 XL. In their hands-on video, unlocking the phone seemed quite fast:\n\nNextrift also claimed that the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s face unlock works \u201cin very dark environments,\u201d but they didn\u2019t capture this on video.\n\nNextrift also found an interesting disclaimer on the face unlock settings: \u201cYour phone can be unlocked by someone who looks a lot like you, say, an identical sibling.\u201d Apple mentioned similar possibilities when it unveiled Face ID on the iPhone X, so this isn\u2019t unusual.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what appears to be an official marketing video of face unlock in action, shared by 9to5Google. Looks pretty speedy in this, too:\n\nThe Pixel 4 has built-in radar\n\nWhat we know: Google fit a tiny radar chip called Soli into the top bezel of the Pixel 4 to let you do things on the phone with the wave of a hand.\n\nWhat we think we know: A few ways it might work, including skipping songs, silencing calls, and checking your lock screen.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: How good the motion-sensing will actually be or how useful motion-sensing might be at all.\n\nYou read that right: Google crammed a tiny radar into the Pixel 4 to sense your hands waving above the device. That information comes straight from Google, which claims you\u2019ll use it to switch apps just by swiping, as shown in this video:\n\nGoogle calls the tech Soli, and it\u2019s something that the company has been working on for years. In the Pixel 4, Google says Soli will power something it calls Motion Sense, which will let you \u201cskip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls\u201d with the wave of a hand. (It also appears in that leaked ad.)\n\nIt may also serve as a neat, low-power way to check your lock screen without touching your phone, according to these leaked menus:\n\nAnd, in what appear to be marketing videos of the feature made by Google, we can see swiping gestures used to silence an alarm and a phone call as well as skip a song, as shared by 9to5Google:\n\nHowever, none of these leaks have shown off Soli in the real world \u2014 GenK couldn\u2019t get it to work \u2014 so we don\u2019t have any idea right now if Motion Sense will be easy to use or perhaps really fiddly.\n\nXDA Developers says they got their hands on the APK for a Motion Sense app that seems to be built into the Pixel 4, and in it, they apparently found a list of 23 apps that may support the Pixel 4\u2019s gesture to skip songs. Some notable ones: Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, Spotify Stations, YouTube Music, and YouTube.\n\nBased on data found in this APK, XDA Developers also says the Motion Sense app will work in 53 regions, up from the 38 that had been previously reported. But there are a few notable countries missing from the list, including Japan, Mexico, India, and New Zealand.\n\nOne fun thing to look forward to about Soli \u2014 it seems Google plans to show you how to use the feature with the help of some Pok\u00e9mon. There is apparently an app on the way that will be titled Pok\u00e9mon Wave Hello, and in it, it seems you\u2019ll use motion gestures to pet and play with five Pok\u00e9mon. 9to5Google has a video of the full demo, which is short, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t show off the motion gestures because the demo isn\u2019t running on a Pixel 4. Here\u2019s a few screenshots:\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA next-generation Google Assistant is on the way\n\nWhat we know: A \u201cnext generation\u201d Google Assistant is coming to new Pixel phones \u201clater this year.\u201d\n\nWhat we think we know: The Pixel 4 will be the phone to introduce that much faster, next-generation Assistant with a new UI.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: If the next-generation Assistant will really be as fast or as efficient at responding as Google claims.\n\nGoogle has told us a little bit about the next-generation Google Assistant already, showing a video of someone moving from task to task without requiring them to say \u201cHey, Google\u201d each time:\n\nRunning on-device and coming to new Pixel phones later this year, the next generation Google Assistant can understand and process your requests up to 10 times faster, making operating your phone, multi-tasking and even composing email easier than ever. #io19 pic.twitter.com/iNPpOvwDM2 \u2014 Google (@Google) May 7, 2019\n\nGoogle showed that same demo live onstage at Google I/O, making it seem as if interacting with the next-gen Assistant will be more natural without the occasional awkwardness that exists currently:\n\nIf the next-gen Assistant works as advertised, it seems like it could be a great way to move around your phone using just your voice.\n\nNextrift\u2019s Pixel 4 XL appeared to have the next-gen Assistant built in. In its testing, Nextrift said the Assistant was \u201cnoticeably quicker\u201d at processing requests and that it could actually make requests of the Assistant without prompting with \u201cHey, Google\u201d each time.\n\nNextrift also has a picture of what seems to be Assistant running on the Pixel 4 XL with a slick new UI:\n\nWe can get a better look at that new UI and the Assistant in action in this YouTube playlist from XDA Developers:\n\nDon\u2019t believe the 5G rumors\n\nWhat we know: One rumor about a 5G variant of the Pixel 4 was faked.\n\nWhat we think we know: Federal Communications Commission filings suggest Google\u2019s next phones won\u2019t have millimeter-wave 5G either.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: Google could have a separate 5G version of the Pixel 4 it hasn\u2019t submitted to the FCC yet.\n\nYou might have seen some chatter about Geekbench scores for a \u201cGoogle Pixel 4 XL 5G,\u201d but don\u2019t get your hopes up. Those scores were faked, and early reports that a set of new Google phones had shown up at the FCC with millimeter-wave 5G were probably confused by the fact that Google\u2019s Soli radar technology uses millimeter-wave as well.\n\n(We took a look at the FCC filings, and they do show a millimeter-wave radio. But it runs at very low power, primarily emits through the front of the phone, and automatically turns off when you\u2019re holding it against your head, which all sound more like Soli.)\n\nThere\u2019s always the chance that Google will release a 5G version of the Pixel 4 down the line, but we wouldn\u2019t count on it.\n\nA few other things\n\nIt seems like Google may be adding some smaller, quality-of-life upgrades to the Pixel 4 lineup, too:\n\nLive Caption, which can automatically transcribe spoken audio from videos or audio playing on your phone, might finally arrive with the Pixel 4 after the company first announced it in May at its I/O developer conference. XDA Developers was able to get Live Caption working on a Pixel 2 XL using APKs ripped apparently from a prerelease Pixel 4 device, and based on its testing, the feature seems to work as Google promised. Here\u2019s a video from XDA Developers of Live Caption transcribing a YouTube video:\n\nThe new Assistant feature that might ship with Pixel 4 might save you from the tedium of waiting on hold during a call. A new \u201cHold my Phone\u201d feature might be able to tell you when a human finally picks up again, according to a source who spoke with 9to5Google.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to theme your Pixel 4 by changing the default color for quick settings / button toggles and picking different icon styles, according to leaked photos and screenshots and a hands-on video from 9to5Google:\n\nThe Pixel 4 might have a way to keep your phone from automatically turning off if it sees that you\u2019re still looking at it. There was a feature called \u201cscreen attention\u201d in an early Android Q beta that appears to have made its way to these leaked Pixel 4 XL units as well. And we suspect that the Pixel 4 could take advantage of its newfound Face ID-like tech to do that similarly to the iPhone.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been jealous of Apple\u2019s white-balancing True Tone displays, the Pixel 4 may have an answer to that as well: a feature called Ambient EQ, which \u201cdynamically adjusts the display based on surrounding light levels.\u201d\n\nLeaks have shown that Google will likely include a new voice recorder app on the Pixel 4 that can automatically transcribe your recordings. 9to5Google has a hands on with the new app:\n\nSqueezing your Pixel to activate Google Assistant may continue to be a thing this year, as this leak seems to confirm that Active Edge will return.\n\nGoogle will introduce new live wallpapers with the Pixel 4, according to 9to5Google, which has previews of nine of them. Many of the new wallpapers are optimized for dark mode and can be customized in different ways (such as choosing a different color) so you can make your wallpaper your own. A couple have some fun tricks; for example, one looks to act like a compass, while another seems to show planets and moons from the perspective of the center of the solar system. Here\u2019s a video of what seems to be the new wallpapers:\n\nPixels might soon have new safety features if you\u2019re in a car crash. XDA Developers found this in what seems to be an accidental update to the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s Emergency Information app, which will apparently be rebranded to \u201cPersonal Safety.\u201d It says that if you\u2019re using the new app, and your Pixel senses that you\u2019ve been in a car crash, it will give you two prompts to confirm that you\u2019re safe. If you don\u2019t, the app will automatically dial 911 for you, and can send your location to emergency contacts.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle may release \u201ca somewhat significant update to YouTube Music\u201d with the Pixel 4, according to a source who spoke with 9to5Google. And Google said, on September 27th, that YouTube Music will now come preinstalled on all devices that ship with Android 10, so we can reasonably expect that YouTube Music will come preinstalled on the Pixel 4.\n\nThe Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL should support Netflix in HDR, according to since-removed listings at Netflix\u2019s support page, but so do the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.\n\nAlthough it could easily come to other Pixel phones as well, XDA Developers spotted an intriguing new \u201cRules\u201d feature that could let you program your phone set its ringer volume (or go silent) when you arrive at a certain place or connect to a particular Wi-Fi network.\n\nBy the way\n\nGot a tip for us? Use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity.\n\nYou might be wondering how all of these unreleased Google phones are finding themselves in the hands of bloggers and vloggers. We don\u2019t have the answer to that yet. Last year, early Pixel 3 XLs that look earmarked for internal testers were reportedly stolen and sold on the Ukrainian black market, and the subsequent Russian language reports all seemingly had the white version of the phone.\n\nThis year, we\u2019re primarily seeing the white model of the Pixel 4 XL \u2014 only these leaks appear to be centered around Vietnam and Thailand, not Ukraine and Russia. We traced a few of them back to a Hanoi shop known as D Store Mobile, but the owner wasn\u2019t interested in hiding; they gladly sent us 20-plus pictures of the phone! 9to5Google also reports that sellers on a Malaysian auction site are selling Pixel 4 XL demo units, so perhaps we will see leaks from those phones soon, too.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got more information, we\u2019d love to know what you know.
