They could cut off his arm tomorrow, and he would find a way to play left-handed.\u201d (Jack Dempsey)\n\nBetween games of the Mid-Mississippi Classic high school baseball tournament, one of Cannon Gibbs\u2019s teammates ventured into the bleachers to talk with parents. When he returned, the teammate nodded toward the crowd and shared an unusual report: \u201cMinshew is in the stands eating a jar of peanut butter,\u201d the teammate told Gibbs.\n\nGibbs scanned the seats and spotted Gardner Minshew, sure enough, eating peanut butter with a spoon straight from the jar. Gibbs would eventually come to call Minshew a football teammate at East Carolina and one of his best friends. Growing up in Brandon, Miss., they were rivals from pre-adolescence, always on opposite soccer and baseball and high school football teams. For some reason, watching Minshew devour his gooey snack made him dislike Minshew even more.\n\n\u201cJust eating in the sun,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cJust eating a jar of peanut butter casually.\u201d\n\nMinshew\u2019s journey \u2014 from collegiate nomad to Washington State cult hero to sixth-round pick to emergency starting quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars to the NFL\u2019s rookie of the month \u2014 has introduced the NFL universe to his compendium of wonderful eccentricity. He stretches in nothing but a jockstrap in the locker room, grooms his mustache with utmost care and regards shirt buttons as optional. He pairs Technicolor headbands with jean shorts. His grandfather wanted him named Beowulf. His parents instead chose Gardner Flint Minshew II, even though there is no Gardner Flint Minshew I.\n\nMinshew replaced free agent splash Nick Foles midway through Jacksonville\u2019s opener, and he provided the Jaguars a capable passer and a breath of fresh air. Rather than wallowing in Foles\u2019s injury or star cornerback Jalen Ramsey\u2019s trade request, Jacksonville has reveled in its mustachioed hero. An advertisement stripped across the top of the Jaguars\u2019 website offered a ticket deal called the Minshew Mania Mini Pack, which includes a headband and fake mustache.\n\nUnderneath the Legend of Gardner Minshew lies the reason Minshew arrived here. All the Uncle Rico comparisons and disco-ball fits belie his seriousness of craft. He is a football junkie who refused to accept the evaluation of coaches who thought him too short and slow for big-time college football or not strong-armed enough for the NFL. Those who knew him before his national starburst call him a weight room freak, film nerd and practice field rat. At Brandon High, his father, Flint, dropped him off an hour before the first bell, five days a week, so he could break down film with his offensive coordinator. At ECU, he could out-squat offensive linemen. His parents bought him a passing target, and within two months, it broke from overuse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Wyatt Rogers, Minshew\u2019s high school coordinator. \u201cIf you told me in 10 years he was going to be the president, I would not be surprised. He is the most focused person I\u2019ve ever been around. They could cut off his arm tomorrow, and he would find a way to play left-handed.\u201d\n\nConsider the peanut butter story. It can play for laughs \u2014 a high school, pre-mustache Minshew chomping on peanut butter while watching his pals play baseball. As Gibbs later realized, he only wanted to add more protein to his diet after his morning weightlifting session. It was a means to improve, performed with no regard for how others viewed him.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t doing it for any purpose other than for the betterment of himself,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cTo others, it just looks kind of strange.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason why wearing a mustache and things like that are okay, because he doesn\u2019t let it get to him,\u201d second-year Jaguars wide receiver D.J. Chark said. \u201cHe just likes to play football. You can\u2019t ask much more of him than that.\u201d (David Zalubowski)\n\nSunday afternoon in their living room, Rogers and his son, Will, a Mississippi State quarterback commit, watched Minshew\u2019s Jaguars play at the Denver Broncos. On third and five from inside the Denver 10-yard line, Minshew took a shotgun snap. He evaded a pass rusher by shuffling right. He darted forward to avoid another. He sprinted and bobbed through a claustrophobic gaggle, all the while keeping the ball tucked to his chest, before he found an open receiver in the end zone.\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d Will said. \u201cThat\u2019s the \u2018Avoid\u2019 drill right there.\u201d\n\nAt Brandon, Minshew would take a three-step drop while Rogers held five tennis balls. Rogers would rifle the tennis balls at Minshew, and Minshew had to dodge them before firing a pass at a target.\n\n\u201cNormally, we don\u2019t do it with Von Miller rushing,\u201d Rogers said, laughing in reference to Denver\u2019s superstar pass rusher.\n\n[The NFL's search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense]\n\nRogers met Minshew when he was in the fifth grade. He had developed a reputation as a local expert on the Air Raid offense, and Minshew\u2019s father wanted to learn more about it for the Pop Warner team he coached. Father and son drove the 75 minutes to where Rogers lived at the time, and Rogers saw an unusual football intelligence in Minshew, even then.\n\nBy the time Minshew had reached high school, Rogers had become Brandon\u2019s offensive coordinator. An injury opened the way for Minshew to start as a freshman, and he never relinquished the position. Minshew honed his accuracy with endless repetition. Minshew\u2019s family bought a $2,500 throwing target about half the size of a soccer goal, with three cutouts filled with catch nets. It could be folded up and transported on a trailer hitch.\n\nMinshew used it every day after school, even in the offseason. When Rogers learned the extra practice violated Mississippi rules, he knew Minshew would refuse to stop, so he moved the drills inside the P.E. gym so nobody could see them. After two months, the target broke from overuse and had to be fixed.\n\n\u201cHe wore it out, man,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nMinshew carried a gallon jug of water with him everywhere to stay hydrated. He was first player in the weight room and the last one to leave, always loading up squat bars and leg presses. The constant work and study made him a prolific star, posting absurd statistics and playoff victories against Mississippi\u2019s best competition. But he stood only 6 feet tall, and his raw speed impressed no one. The biggest colleges in the state passed him over.\n\n\u201cThey damn sure missed out on him,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI can tell you that.\u201d\n\n\n\nMinshew before Washington State's game against UCLA in September. (Young Kwak)\n\nMinshew enrolled at Troy and immediately found it a poor fit. He transferred to Northwest Mississippi Community College and won the junior college national championship. From there he went to East Carolina, where a brutal schedule and a coaching transition led to constant losing over his two seasons as a part-time starter.\n\nEven as the Pirates lost, Minshew won over teammates. Gibbs, a linebacker and his roommate, knew if Minshew was in the room, even in the summer, he would either be reading the Bible, a novel or his playbook. He arrived at fall camp practices in white T-shirts and overalls while carrying a lunch pail, to send the message he had come to work. At a team talent show, Minshew performed the entire dance sequence from the end of \u201cNapoleon Dynamite.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as he started dancing, we all started cracking up,\u201d said ECU offensive tackle Garrett McGhin, another former teammate who considers Minshew a best friend.\n\nTeammates there marveled at Minshew\u2019s energetic competitiveness. He treated ping-pong as life-or-death struggles. When other teammates wanted to rest, he would send group texts to organize Spikeball games. He befriended the entire ECU team \u2014 offensive and defensive players \u2014 and wore the same Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt to team functions, practice and class. On nights out, he would dance and sing along to everything between Alan Jackson and Lil Boosie, in between orders of vodka waters.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say he knows what he likes when it comes to liquid encouragement,\u201d McGhin said. \u201cIt\u2019s his own personality, just amplified. He\u2019s a dancer. He\u2019s definitely got some moves when he\u2019s out on the town. \u2026 He had that energy you just kind of gravitate to. He\u2019s the epitome of, you treat the janitor the same way you treat the CEO.\u201d\n\n[From the archives: Wazzu's Minshew has been everywhere, man]\n\nAfter he graduated from ECU, Minshew still had one year of eligibility left. Alabama offered him the chance to be a backup, and Minshew nearly accepted for the chance to start his career in coaching under Nick Saban.\n\nIn the other corner of the country, tragedy happened. Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski, who had been expected to become the Cougars\u2019 starter, committed suicide. One ripple effect, as meaningless as it seemed, is that Coach Mike Leach had a quarterback opening. He called Minshew and famously asked him, \u201cYou want to come lead the nation in passing?\u201d\n\nTurning down Alabama was hard. But Rogers knew right away Minshew would choose Washington State. He had wanted to play in the Air Raid since middle school, and now he could quarterback for the man who mastered it.\n\n\u201cI think that kind of rang a bell,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cLike, \u2018I may have a few snaps left in me before I chase this coaching thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn one year in Pullman, Minshew became a cult figure. He did lead the nation in passing. The school passed out mustaches for students \u2014 men and women \u2014 to wear in the seats. After Washington State beat Oregon, fans carried Minshew off the field.\n\nRogers still chokes up when he recalled the moment, thinking back to the Mississippi college programs who turned him away, to all the worn-out equipment and the nomadic path required to reach the tops of those shoulders.\n\nAs Minshew became a star, his persona grew larger than his football acumen. Last year, when pictures of Minshew\u2019s mustache first appeared during the summer, Rogers called his former quarterback.\n\n\u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d Rogers asked. \u201cThat thing looks terrible. Shave that crap off your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, I can\u2019t,\u201d Minshew replied. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of taken on a life of its own.\u201d\n\nMinshew has embraced stardom without losing his devotion to football. \u201cOne of those worlds will never cross into the other one,\u201d Rogers said. In an NFL locker room, things like the rookie quarterback garnering attention for his quirky looks can rankle veterans. But Minshew\u2019s focus and sincerity have prevented that. After the Jaguars drafted Minshew, he called team officials less than an hour later to request a playbook.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason why wearing a mustache and things like that are okay, because he doesn\u2019t let it get to him,\u201d second-year Jaguars wide receiver D.J. Chark said. \u201cHe just likes to play football. You can\u2019t ask much more of him than that.\u201d\n\nIn Jacksonville, and across the NFL, Minshew Mania will continue, and not because of how he stretches or his facial hair or an uncommon name. It will continue because he expects more of himself than anybody else, and he has the drive to prove himself right.\n\n\u201cThe Gardner you see for the Jags is the same Gardner he\u2019s been since I\u2019ve known him,\u201d McGhin said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been his own person. He doesn\u2019t care. Those aviators, I think he\u2019s had the same single pair of aviators for five years. It\u2019s funny, because they don\u2019t even sit right on his face.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nFinding the next Sean McVay has proved elusive as losses pile up for first-year NFL coaches\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 5: Count on the Cowboys, Steelers and Raiders\n\nDerek Carr defends Vontaze Burfict, \u2018one of the most misunderstood people in the NFL\u2019", "description": "Those who know the Jaguars quarterback say that beneath the mustache and the legend lies a football junkie.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports", "October At Pm", "Adam Kilgore Covers National Sports For The Washington Post.
