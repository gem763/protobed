He also said that the EU must match the U.K.\u2019s recent compromises in order to reach a deal, which he said he still believes is possible.\n\nJohnson also promised Macron that his new proposals command support in the British parliament that the deal reached between Brussels and his predecessor, Theresa May, did not have.\n\n\u201cThis is the chance to get a deal done: a deal that is backed by parliamentarians and a deal which involves compromise on all sides,\u201d a senior No. 10 Downing Street official said. \u201cThe U.K. has made a big, important offer but it\u2019s time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not, the U.K. will leave with no deal. The surrender act and its authors are undermining negotiations, but if EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters on Saturday that \u201ctime is tight\u201d to find a compromise before the European Council summit on October 17 and 18.\n\nJohnson also spoke to Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa over the weekend, and will continue talks with EU27 leaders Monday, Downing Street said.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "French president said the \u2018principles of the European Union\u2019 must be maintained.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Lili Bayer", "Charlie Cooper", "Thibault Larger"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/h_55299904-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
