Chelsea is my priority but afterwards if in the end I am forced to make a choice, I will do it like when I left Arsenal.\n\n\u2018He (Frank Lampard) will almost certainly watch the matches [I just played for France]. In any case, I am going back to Chelsea pumped up.\u2019\n\nChelsea, of course, are currently operating under a two-window transfer ban and would not be able to replace Giroud should he be sold.\n\nLampard has intimated he wants to keep the Frenchman but with Abraham in such fine form it looks unlikely that the club will be able to satisfy the forward\u2019s need for playing time.\n\nMORE: Manchester United fear difficulties in landing new signings in January transfer window", "description": "Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud admits he will have no option but to leave the club in January should he continue to be left out of the side by Frank Lampard....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1168930526_1571145861.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
