In landmark cases, the court has at times recognized that the force of the ruling\u2019s bottom line is more important than the specific legal principles at stake \u2014 that there are some cases in which it\u2019s more essential for the court to speak with one voice than to air every possible legal argument.\n\nThe court insisted on unanimous opinions, for instance, in critical civil rights cases, such as Brown v. Board of Education, \u201cBrown II,\u201d and Cooper v. Aaron, decisions that found school segregation to be unconstitutional and ordered school districts to desegregate. It had done the same in Ex parte Quirin, a 1942 case that had upheld the government\u2019s use of a military tribunal to try eight German saboteurs caught in the United States during World War II. We know from the justices\u2019 private papers in each of these cases that it wasn\u2019t that the justices each agreed with every word of the court\u2019s opinions; they simply agreed that the cases were important enough that they shouldn\u2019t be determined by a divided vote, and that the reasoning shouldn\u2019t be called into question through separate opinions.", "description": "", "authors": ["Steve Vladeck", "Washingtonpost.Com Outlook What-Would-Happen-If-Trump-Ignored-Divided-Supreme-Court-Ruling-Against-Him"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
