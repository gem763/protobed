The Sept. 17 election left the sides essentially tied but Mr. Rivlin said that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s chances of forming a government were greater than Mr. Gantz\u2019s \u201cat the moment.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Netanyahu faces a stiff challenge: He has 28 days to assemble a majority of at least 61 seats in the 120-seat Parliament and no clear path to that number. The parties that have endorsed his bid for another term won 55 seats.\n\nMr. Rivlin had been pushing Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to forge a broad unity government including both their parties. Mr. Gantz won the endorsement of 54 lawmakers, one less than Mr. Netanyahu.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must assemble a parliamentary majority, a task that eluded him in the previous election.", "authors": ["Isabel Kershner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/world/25israel-sub/25israel-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
