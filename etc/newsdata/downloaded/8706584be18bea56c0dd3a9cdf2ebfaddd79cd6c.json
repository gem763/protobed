We have not yet disclosed our main sources of power and what they have seen and we have used so far is a small part of our capacities,\u201d the major general said.\n\nAFP contributed to this story", "description": "Iran's top Revolutionary Guards commander, Major General Hossein Salami, warned destroying arch-rival Israel was an \"achievable goal.\"", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/major-general-salami-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
