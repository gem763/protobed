The embattled leader was able to deliver her policy speech more than an hour later by video\n\nStanding ramrod-straight, she then launched into a dry and detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong's shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent, and other welfare issues.\n\nWith its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for development, the 50-minute speech titled 'Treasure Hong Kong our home' seemed likely to fuel protesters' criticism that Lam is deaf to their concerns about the future of the territory's freedoms, unique in China.\n\nEven before Lam delivered it, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed the address as a 'shame and a sham' and said the chief executive had lost all authority.\n\n'She is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,' Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam's address there.\n\nA man watches a television broadcast showing Lam delivering a policy address in Hong Kong on Wednesday after her attempts to speak live at the city's legislature were abandoned\n\nLam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement.\n\nThe widespread use of tear gas by riot-control squads and 2,600 arrests, widely decried as heavy handed, have triggered public disgust with the 30,000-strong police force once considered among Asia's finest.\n\nHardcore black-clad and masked protesters have responded with widespread vandalism of China-linked businesses, subway stations and other targets, and attacked police with gasoline bombs and other weapons.\n\nHundreds of basketball fans gather in Wan Chai Southorn Playground to show support of the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey and leagues commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday after Morey showed support for the city's protesters and Silver protected free speech\n\nThe Asian financial hub has been rocked by street protests since June.

The bill was passed yesterday, a move that enraged China\n\nThis month, two police shootings that injured teenage protesters, the stabbing of a police officer, and the detonation of a small, remote-controlled bomb close to police officers ratcheted up violence to levels unprecedented since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nSaying rioters are 'spreading chaos and fear,' Lam appealed for order and sought to end her address on a positive note.\n\nHer Facebook profile was updated before she spoke, with a photo of a smiling Lam against a backdrop of a rainbow over Hong Kong's harbor.\n\n'We have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other,' she said.\n\n'I thoroughly believe that Hong Kong will be able to ride out this storm and move on.'", "description": "Beijing-backed Lam had to be escorted out of the meeting hall by security guards after opposing lawmakers today twice forced her to stop delivering a speech laying out her policy objectives.", "authors": ["Billie Thomson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/10/19779960-0-image-a-14_1571218026295.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
