However, 48% of the population did not take a single flight abroad in the last year.\n\nThe new findings bolster calls for a frequent flyer levy, a proposal under which each citizen would be allowed one tax-free flight per year but would pay progressively higher taxes on each additional flight taken.\n\nThe revelations follow a new report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government\u2019s official adviser, which urged ministers to put tougher regulations on the international aviation and shipping sectors to keep the economy on track for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nEnvironmental activists said the new figures showed the UK could cut air traffic and emissions without affecting ordinary holidaymakers.\n\nA radical way to cut emissions \u2013 ration everyone\u2019s flights | Sonia Sodha Read more\n\n\u201cThere is this narrative that tackling the climate change problem from aviation means stopping people from taking holidays or seeing their families \u2013 and actually, when you look at this data that is wrong,\u201d said Leo Murray, director of innovation at 10:10 Climate Action.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is target a minority of problem flyers and stop them from taking so many flights,\u201d he added.\n\nThe findings are based on responses from more than 15,000 English residents who participated in the 2018 National Transport Survey and were revealed to the Guardian following a Freedom of Information request.\n\nThe aviation sector accounted for about 7% of the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. It is projected to be the single biggest source of emissions in the UK by 2050 due to the steadily increasing demand for flights.\n\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, also endorsed the idea of a frequent flyer levy. \u201cIt makes it easier for families to fly once a year, but the escalating tax on further flights means that the people responsible for most of the problem are the ones who end up paying most of the tax \u2013 or, ideally, flying a lot less,\u201d he said.\n\nSi\u00e2n Berry, co-leader of the Green party, said the new data showed the UK could cut its air traffic without hitting those who can least afford it. \u201cIt\u2019s about people who fly again and again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cA progressive tax on the most frequent flyers is a fair policy that most people would come behind if the government put it forward,\u201d she added.\n\nTuesday\u2019s CCC report suggested a number of policy options to curb demand for flights, including a frequent flyer levy, and said technological improvements alone could not be the solution to the growing emissions problem. There is currently no country in which travellers pay an escalating levy on each flight they take in a year.\n\nHow your flight emits as much CO2 as many people do in a year Read more\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a true zero-carbon plane, demand cannot continue to grow unfettered over the long-term,\u201d it stated.\n\nEmissions from international aviation are not currently included in national carbon budgets such as the UK\u2019s but instead managed by a dedicated UN agency \u2013 the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, some have said the body is too secretive and close to industry to take on the major polluters.\n\nThe CCC said international air travel should be included in the UK\u2019s climate strategy like any other business sector.\n\n\u201cNot having [international aviation] in the target is a barrier to putting in place good policies to get us on the trajectory to be net-zero overall,\u201d said Chris Stark, the CCC\u2019s chief executive.\n\nHe argued that the UK should take a leading role in cutting emissions from the sector, rather than wait for more comprehensive international agreements to be struck.\n\n\u201cThere should be no barrier to bringing aviation emissions into the carbon budgets and then putting in place a set of policies that at some stage in the future will be compatible with those international agreements,\u201d Stark said.\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cTackling climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges that we face. Which is why this government has set a bold 2050 net zero target for the UK and a greener aviation industry will play a key role in that.\n\n\u201cThe government is funding the future of flight and have announced \u00a35m in funding for new technologies like electric and autonomous aircraft to help us tackle climate change. We are working with our partners to ensure the government takes a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.\u201d", "description": "FoI request to DfT reveals 10% most frequent flyers took more than half of flights abroad in 2018", "authors": ["Niko Kommenda"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40e9831a69bc8e097e91aa12fcfcb968961160f/0_254_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28335d5398617b6c824bf867b5cff104", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
