A July 2013 study of 4,500 couples even found that money-related arguments were the most intense fights couples had, no matter their income or debt levels.\n\n\"Arguments about money are the top predictor for divorce because it happens at all levels,\" lead researcher Sonya Britt, assistant professor of family studies and human services, said in a press release.\n\nThose arguments often derive from different financial views, like if one partner is a spender and one is a saver.\n\nThere are, however, ways to quell that anxiety and prevent money-related fights if you and your partner want to move in together, combine finances, or budget for a specific goal like buying a home or having a child.\n\nBut first, remember that you and your partner will never see everything eye-to-eye, including money matters, and that's OK. Relationships aren't about harping on your significant other until they break down and agree to do what you want.\n\nRelationships are, however, about growing from difficult conversations, and this a necessary one. It's important you first both acknowledge your divergent financial strategies if you want to avoid future pent-up feelings that could end your relationship.\n\nApproach the discussion as a chance to get know your partner\n\nBefore you even start a conversation about money, shift how you're thinking about it. Rather than a battle, view it as a way to learn more about each other and what makes you tick, Tribeca Therapy founder Matt Lundquist, said.\n\n\"Think of it as building infrastructure for talking about hard things,\" Lundquist said. \"People who can talk about money in uncomfortable ways can also do the same about sex or other [touchy] topics.\"\n\nRead more: The 2 types of fights that can end your relationship, according to therapists\n\nHe added that often, couples who discuss these awkward topics come away learning more about their partners than they assumed they would. Maybe you'll learn your partner's online shopping habit that you can't stand is a habit because they almost never shop at brick-and-mortars, or that they spend a lot on take-out meals because no one taught them how to cook.\n\n\"Be more curious versus having a mindset of 'I can't live the way you do,'\" Lundquist said.\n\nWhether your parents were suckers for discounts or enjoyed splurging, their philosophies likely rubbed off on you. d3sign/Getty Images\n\nFirst, discuss how money affected your upbringing\n\nYour initial money chat should focus on getting to know more about your individual backgrounds as they pertain to money. See, it's impossible to separate how you were raised and how you saw your parents treat money from your own financial hangups. Taking a deep dive into that subject can help you understand a partner's live-in-the-moment attitude toward spending, for example, and they can understand your more frugal approach.\n\nRead more: How to prevent wedding-planning stress from ruining the big day, according to a therapist devoted to anxious brides\n\nWhen you're having this chat, make sure you let each other speak without interrupting the other, since this conversation isn't about proving your money moves are the right ones. In fact, if your partner's money habits bother you, think about why even before you even approach them.\n\nQuestion your own money-related assumptions\n\nIf, for example, you're afraid your partner's spending habits will result in them falling short on the rent you both contribute to, consider whether there's evidence that's true or if that supposition stems from your fears. For instance, maybe you have a family member who was evicted for falling short on rent and you fear that could become you, or your parents harped on you for your entire life about making rent on time and it's now ingrained in your mind.\n\nOften, people's money-related fears lead them to believe their own money habits are morally superior to others' habits. That mindset won't get you anywhere productive relationship-wise.\n\nRead more: The 5 steps all couples need to take if they want to repair their relationship after cheating\n\n\"Don't pass your fear to the other person,\" Lundquist said. \"Recognize it comes from within you; otherwise it can destroy your relationship because it makes you mad at the other person.\"\n\nRevisit your money discussion throughout your relationship.

When that happens, you both have to be open to reevaluating the terms of your unofficial contract and re-learning what money means to each of you.\n\nIf you love and trust your partner enough to live under the same roof, buy a house together, or start a family together, you have to trust they'll understand the types of financial situations that make you uncomfortable and will do what they can to prevent them because they love you too. And you should do the same for them, too.", "description": "If your partner's money habits are giving you anxiety, it's time to address the conflict before it could ruin your relationship for good.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d96744e32bf0f03207a6918?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
