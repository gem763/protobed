When we voted to leave it seems very clear to me that it was the political union that we were voting to leave, not any 'free' (It never has been, or will be, 'free'!) trading agreement. The EU frequently boasts of the 'wonderful' trade agreements it has made, painfully slowly, throughout the world over the years.
