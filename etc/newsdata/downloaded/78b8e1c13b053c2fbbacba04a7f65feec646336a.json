And when Wall Street doesn\u2019t get the nitty gritty from management teams and politicians, it will often loudly voice its displeasure \u2014 usually by dumping stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the lay of the land at the moment in the markets following President Trump\u2019s trade truce announced late Friday afternoon. The president quickly hyped a potential win in China buying $40 billion to $50 billion in agricultural products from struggling U.S. farmers. Stocks initially moved higher on the news, but then reversed course and continue to trade with a downward bias on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a game-changer,\u201d UBS head of equities derivatives research Stuart Kaiser tells Yahoo Finance of the preliminary trade agreement, which isn\u2019t yet signed. Kaiser thinks if anything the trade truce sets a near-term floor in the stock market \u2014 but he nonetheless expects the S&P 500 to end 2019 at 2,550.\n\nThe major stock index is currently trading above 2,900.\n\nWall Street still not sold\n\nAsk around Wall Street and the mood is that what Trump just announced doesn\u2019t solve several serious issues that have held back the markets these past six months. For starters, $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods are still in effect. Many businesses, as a result, are still seeing their costs of production go up and earnings power go down.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 11: U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He after announcing a \"phase one\" trade agreement with China in the Oval Office at the White House October 11, 2019 in Washington, DC. China and the United States have slapped each other with hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs since the current trade war began between the world\u2019s two largest national economies in 2018.

CEOs of major companies have no reason to be more optimistic today \u2014 relative to a week ago \u2014 that putting capital to work would earn a strong return amidst a trade war with key export market China.\n\nSo, why bother pulling the trigger on expensive new equipment? And why should investors buy into the notion that slumping U.S. economic growth would magically ignite into 2020?\n\n\u201cThe bottom line for us is that without a significant rollback of existing tariffs, we don\u2019t see how a mini deal will change the currently negative trajectory of growth in the economy and earnings,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson says.\n\nJust provide more details\n\nThe market was bid up going into the U.S. and China trade talks on hopes of a true breakthrough. That didn\u2019t come to pass, however. Considering any progress made on trade in the last week could be blown up with one Trump tweet or comment made in a pool session with reporters outside the White House, it\u2019s likely that markets will revert back to being on edge.\n\nIf Trump wants to unleash that yearend rally in stocks that boosts his poll numbers, he would be wise to get the details of phase one of his trade deal out there into the markets and strongly signal that reaching phase three isn\u2019t a pipe-dream during a hypothetical second term.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
