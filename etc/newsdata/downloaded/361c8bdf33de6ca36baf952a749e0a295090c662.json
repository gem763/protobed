More than 1,000 people were said to have attended the event, which featured meditation and dancing.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesperson Zoe Jones, 24, said Marble Arch would be used throughout the two-week protests as demonstrators move between other sites.\n\nShe said: \"The next two weeks will involve marches and family-friendly events, there'll be some spicier actions as well and some will be arrestable.\n\n\"We've had 4,000 rebels sign up and say they are willing to be arrested - which is a huge increase on the number arrested in April .\n\n\"The public perception of XR is that we're disrupting ordinary people's lives by blocking roads and that's why this time we're taking our protests to the seat of power and taking it to Westminster.\n\n\"We are on the public's side and we are ordinary people who are extremely concerned.\"\n\nThe group, which was founded in the UK and staged its first action in October last year, takes inspiration from protests including Ghandi\u2019s Satyagraha and the US civil rights movement to bring attention to climate change.\n\nSince its inception it has caused disruption in cities across the world, bringing major thoroughfares in central London to a standstill as protesters occupied roads and glued themselves to buildings and trains.\n\nHowever, the Metropolitan Police has raised concerns that the action takes officers away from other duties. Ahead of the protests, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: \u201cThe Met has been planning the policing operation for this protest, unprecedented in its length and scale, for several months.\n\n\u201cThey are planning a prolonged, co-ordinated protest, designed to bring the heart of London to a standstill and disrupt the daily business of people who live, work and are visiting London\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe organisers have said that one of their aims is to overwhelm police resources. This is hugely disappointing and irresponsible, when officers are working hard every day to tackle violence and keep the capital safe and secure.\n\n\u201cSignificant operations like this take officers away from their communities and core responsibilities, but Londoners can still count on the Met to respond to crime.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that this protest is proportionately policed, officers are being drawn from across the service, with shifts extended and rest days cancelled. This will impact on officers and staff and I want to acknowledge and commend their commitment.\"", "description": "The Metropolitan Police\u2019s decision to seize protest equipment and arrest activists from climate campaign group Extinction Rebellion has been called \u201cplain wrong\u201d by MPs in the run up to the group\u2019s fortnight of action in Westminster and across the world.", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/18/police-extinction-rebellion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
