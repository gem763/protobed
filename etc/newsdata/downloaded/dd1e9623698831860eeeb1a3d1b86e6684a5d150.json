There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him,\" Silver said at the first TIME 100 Health Summit on Thursday about Beijing's reaction to Morey tweeting the slogan: \"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\" in support of pro-democracy protesters there.\n\nMorey later deleted the tweet from his personal account, but not before spurring a rebuke from the NBA and inciting a backlash in China. Authorities in the communist country canceled publicity events and news conferences last week, while state TV refused to broadcast two exhibition games between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nLakers superstar LeBron James, considered one of the more outspoken athletes on social justice issues in a league that prides itself on being one of the most progressive in sports, was skewered this week after he criticized Morey\u2019s tweet as \"either misinformed or not really educated on the situation.\" Some Hong Kong protesters burned and stomped on James jerseys during a rally. They threw basketballs at a photo of James and chanted support for Morey.\n\nOn Thursday, Silver said the NBA has lost a lot of money due to the flashpoint with China.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201c\u2026The losses have already been substantial. Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we'll see what happens next.\"\n\n\"I don't know where we go from here,\" Silver added. \"The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who previously has claimed the NBA and American businesses were surrendering to \"Chinese techno-authoritarianism,\" said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s good that Morey still has his job and the NBA deserves credit there. Let\u2019s put this in perspective though: When an American citizen stands for basic human rights, the Chinese Communist Party tries to get him fired. But when a Chinese citizen stands for basic human rights, the Chinese Communist Party has a way of making them disappear.\u201d", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has revealed that Chinese\u00a0officials\u00a0asked him to fire Houston Rockets\u00a0general manager\u00a0Daryl Morey over his pro-Hong Kong tweet, which caused an international controversy.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
