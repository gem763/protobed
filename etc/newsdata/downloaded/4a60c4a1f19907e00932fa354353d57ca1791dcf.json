Warren\u2019s rallies have attracted tens of thousands of supporters, a sign of grassroots enthusiasm that had been a hallmark of Sanders\u2019s 2016 run.\n\nThe news media and pundits appear eager to cast the race for the nomination as a two-person contest between Biden and Warren.\n\nA sense of urgency has fallen over Sanders\u2019s supporters, who worry that the liberal energy in the race has shifted behind Warren.\n\n\u201cIt does look like she\u2019s starting to take over,\u201d said one Sanders ally with close ties to the campaign. \u201cNobody is attacking us, and that\u2019s probably because their internal polling says there\u2019s no reason to attack us, for the same reason you don\u2019t see people out there attacking Beto O\u2019Rourke. Biden\u2019s not out there attacking our electability. His allies are out there attacking Warren\u2019s electability. Why do you think that is?\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign says it\u2019s not sweating the ebbs and flows of the race.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders has a lifetime record of standing for working people in marginalized communities and he\u2019ll continue to do that, that\u2019s why he almost won the nomination last time and will win the nomination this time,\u201d said Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver. \u201cThere are a lot of new candidates and voters are appropriately kicking the tires on them. But at the end of the day, Bernie\u2019s consistent advocacy and his willingness to fight for working people are what will set him apart.\u201d\n\nLiberals not that this primary season is longer than most, and that it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to sustain momentum in a field this large.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to count out any candidate, including Sen. Sanders,\u201d said Neil Sroka, a strategist for the progressive group Democracy for America, which has not endorsed yet but is considering several candidates, including Sanders and Warren. \u201cBernie and his supporters have a long history of being counted out and left for dead, so declaring this race in any way over, or finalized or having moved on to a new phase is completely premature.\u201d\n\nOver the past few weeks, the Sanders campaign has quietly reshuffled its top leadership positions in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the Sanders campaign replaced the state director who oversaw his 2016 primary victory over Clinton in the Granite State. That move was puzzling to some, as polls show Sanders running strong in New Hampshire.\n\nLate Wednesday, the Sanders campaign confirmed to The Hill that it also parted ways with its Iowa political director.\n\nA poll of Iowa released this week found Biden at 25 percent and Warren at 23 percent, with Sanders falling to fifth place at 8 percent, although most other surveys show Sanders running stronger in the Hawkeye State.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nBut Democrats say that staffing isn\u2019t necessarily the issue. They say Sanders needs to find a new formula, because playing the same hits from 2016 isn\u2019t working as effectively this go-round.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything differently, it\u2019s the exact same thing,\u201d said one unaffiliated Democrat. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s realized the game has changed and he\u2019s not running against one individual person, he\u2019s running against 20 people.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWeaver argued that this time around, Sanders has shifted his focus from attacking billionaires to being the lead proponent on \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll continue to draw a contrast here with the other candidates who as a group have weaker proposals with lofty goals but not enough substance to achieve those goals,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nAnd Sanders\u2019s allies say reports about him losing traction are overblown. They believe Sanders\u2019s fervent base of supporters and his commitment to Medicare for All have kept him in a strong position in the race.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew there would be ebbs and flows in a competitive race and most people are just now beginning to tune in,\u201d said Jonathan Tasini, a progressive writer who backed Sanders in 2016 but has not endorsed in this race. \u201cWith all that has happened, Bernie continues to have a very strong, loyal base, which is expanding, for example, to growing support among Hispanics. At the end of the day, all the polls, big crowds and media hype today won\u2019t matter as long as there is a strong organization to turn supporters out to vote.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign believes it\u2019s being underestimated and has accused the media of highlighting polls aimed at furthering a narrative around his decline.\n\nIt\u2019s true that not all polls show Warren breaking free from Sanders.\n\nA national Fox News survey released on Wednesday found Biden at 29 percent support, followed by Sanders at 18 percent and Warren at 16 percent. Sanders remains competitive in most polls of Iowa and New Hampshire, and analyses have found Sanders with a solid base of support from a diverse coalition that includes white working class voters and Hispanics.\n\nOn Thursday from Chapel Hill, N.C., Sanders embarked on a tour of colleges and universities in an effort to turn out the young voters who have been the bedrock of his national campaigns.\n\nPolls show Sanders dominating the field with young voters and the campaign believes their support is not reflected in the polls.\n\nThe campaign says it has raised more from young donors than Biden, Warren, Sens.

Nina Turner.\n\nSome progressives note that Warren still has a lot of work to do with black voters, although recent polls show her gaining some traction here.\n\nSanders this week will also be doing outreach to labor unions, with a focus on teachers, which the campaign says is the top occupation for Sanders\u2019s donors.\n\nThe campaign has released new ads promoting the teacher strikes in West Virginia. Tasini praised this strategy, noting that the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association \u201csend the largest organizational share of delegates to the Democratic convention.\n\n\u201cWhile other candidates court big money at fancy fundraisers, this campaign is supported by teachers from West Virginia and every state in the country,\u201d said Shakir.", "description": "Sen.
