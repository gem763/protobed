Thanks to an innovative, interlocking narrative and unconventional structure, Breaking Bad, the ongoing spinoff series Better Call Saul, and the newly released El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie are catnip for dedicated fans who love to track minute details and callbacks.\n\nTo understand exactly how the timeline works, it makes sense to start with the original series, even though it\u2019s essentially the middle part of the story. Breaking Bad, by and large, covers a two-year period of Walter White\u2019s life, which marks his evolution from steady family man and teacher into meth-dealing criminal mastermind. The show is typically understood to begin in 2008, meaning that the main action of El Camino, which tracks the actions of Aaron Paul\u2019s Jesse Pinkman immediately after the series finale, begins in 2010. There are some date discrepancies over the course of Breaking Bad\u2019s five seasons, such as a reference to the death of Osama bin Laden (who wasn\u2019t killed until 2011), but by and large the timeline proves to be internally consistent.\n\nEl Camino is focused on what happens to Jesse after Walter White murdered the men who locked him in a cage for six months, getting its title from the car Jesse steals to make his emotional getaway in the final moments of the Breaking Bad series finale. Many important Breaking Bad characters make appearances despite being dead, as the movie flashes back to important moments within the timeline of the show. Those flashbacks, and how they fit into the original Breaking Bad timeline, are as follows.\n\nMike and Jesse\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nThe first trip backward \u2014 featuring a cameo by Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut \u2014 takes place just after the great methylamine train heist in Breaking Bad season five, which ended with Todd (Jesse Plemons) shooting a young boy who had the bad luck to spot them. Mike and Jesse both decided to get out of the meth business at that point, which displeased Walt greatly.\n\nTodd and Jesse\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nThe extended sequence where Todd enlists Jesse\u2019s help to deal with the body of his housekeeper is set during the several months of \u201cGranite State\u201d when Jesse was being held by the gang of Nazis, led by Kenny (Kevin Rankin). It\u2019s here that Jesse learns that Todd has a large stash of cash hidden in his apartment, which Jesse goes to obtain after escaping his cage.\n\nJesse\u2019s Cage\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nAlso taking place during that time frame is the additional sequence explaining how Jesse\u2019s new adversaries Neil (Scott MacArthur) and Casey (Scott Shepherd) were connected to Kenny\u2019s gang \u2014 Neil was the welder who built the rig that kept Jesse chained up in the meth lab/warehouse.\n\nWalt and Jesse\n\nIt was relatively inevitable that there would be a flashback to happier days for Jesse and Walt (Bryan Cranston), specifically the morning after one of their desert cook sessions. It\u2019s not said explicitly, but based on Walt\u2019s coughing and Jesse\u2019s emphasis on hydration, it seems likely that this was the infamous trip from season two\u2019s \u201c4 Days Out,\u201d when their attempt to cook over a million dollars\u2019 worth of meth stranded them in the desert with a nonfunctional RV.\n\nJane and Jesse\n\nIn that flashback, Jesse talks with an unseen girlfriend on the phone \u2014 it\u2019s of course Jane, whom Jesse remembers later in a film-ending flashback. Based on wardrobe (Jesse\u2019s bright-yellow hoodie) and the script (Jesse brings up Jane\u2019s thoughts about \u201cthe universe,\u201d which came up in a flashback scene from the season-three episode \u201cAbiquiu\u201d), this scene is likely set during their drive home from visiting the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe museum in Santa Fe at some point during season two, before their descent into heroin use.\n\nHow does this all connect to the larger timeline? There aren\u2019t any major references to Better Call Saul in El Camino, but the spinoff series, which functions largely as a prequel to Breaking Bad, begins approximately in 2002, and by season four has arrived in the year 2003, an era where the phones are not smart and Blockbuster Video still thrives.\n\nFlashbacks on Saul fill in a great deal of Jimmy McGill\u2019s (Bob Odenkirk) backstory, including looks back at his childhood and key milestones in his early law career, while the main timeline not only tracks Jimmy\u2019s life, but the rising drug empire of Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), with appearances by long-dead Breaking Bad characters in happier and healthier times. (Mark Margolis, as the eventually handicapped Hector Salamanca, gets to prove that he can do a whole lot more than just ring a bell emphatically.) Better Call Saul is driving quickly toward the year 2008, when Jimmy McGill has fully transitioned into \u201ccriminal\u201d lawyer Saul Goodman. At the end of season four, Jimmy is now using the name Saul Goodman for his still quasi-legit legal practice, but the show has yet to close the gap between those specific years.\n\nBetter Call Saul also features a few flash-forwards to Jimmy\u2019s future life, post-2010, as \u201cGene,\u201d a Cinnabon franchise manager trying to keep a low profile in Omaha, Nebraska. It\u2019s not exactly clear how much time has elapsed since Saul Goodman left Albuquerque for his new life, which happened about six months before the end of Breaking Bad, approximately in March 2010. So there\u2019s every chance that in season five of Saul, we could get a flash-forward to Gene turning on the news \u2014 and finding out what happened to his ol\u2019 pals Walter and Jesse.", "description": "The Netflix movie sequel El Camino, starring Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, is packed with flashbacks to previously unseen moments from Breaking Bad.
