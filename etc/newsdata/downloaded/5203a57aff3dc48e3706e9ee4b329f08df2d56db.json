We are reliable to each other.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Twenty-five years after the signing of a landmark peace treaty, ties between Jordan and Israel mirror the ebbs and flows of a turbulent region, while many Jordanians still regard the Jewish state as an \"enemy\".  \"Israel remains our number one enemy,\" Yazid Khleifat, a 38-year-old", "authors": ["Mussa Hattar"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.EQHTETs9k1al9StoytLiw--~B/aD01NTY7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/8b40d6f95ee146b111d8481529ef5e5b82c8cfb4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
