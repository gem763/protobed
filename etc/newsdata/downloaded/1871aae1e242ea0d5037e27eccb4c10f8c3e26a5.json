During his visit to last night\u2019s The Late Show, Gelman got the chance to revisit the extremely short-lived role, which took place at the end of The Colbert Report\u2019s sixth episode on Comedy Central. The show originally had plans to turn the segment into a recurring thing at the end of every episode, where \u2014 similar to how Jon Stewart used to toss the show to Colbert \u2014 Colbert would then toss to a nonexistent morning show called Yet Another Day, with Gelman\u2019s Spencer serving as its very first co-host.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m a star now! I\u2019ve made it! I\u2019m on The Colbert Report! This is a bit; they\u2019re gonna be bringing me back all the time,\u2019 you know? And then \u2026 nothing. Nothing for quite a while,\u201d Gelman says, reflecting on the experience. After Colbert apologizes for cutting him, Gelman says, \u201cI appreciate it. But I understand, because you have a whole show to run, you got this really talented guy in there, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh God, I like him, but I don\u2019t totally know how to use him. I like him a lot, but I don\u2019t want to see him all the time.\u2019\u201d Colbert: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we said after you shot: \u2018He\u2019s really good! He\u2019d look better with a beard, but he\u2019s really good!\u2019\u201d", "description": "On CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d Brett Gelman looks back on the very tiny role he had during the sixth episode of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-brett-gelman-colbert.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
