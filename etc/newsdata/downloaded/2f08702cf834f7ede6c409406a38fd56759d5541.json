But the first day he can officially start the process has not yet arrived. According to the terms of the agreement, Trump can submit a letter on Nov. 4 to the United Nations to start the clock to withdraw the United States formally from global climate pact.\n\nWithdrawing takes one year, which would mean the United States would leave the agreement one day after the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election.\n\nAlthough Trump initially said he may seek to renegotiate the terms of the Paris agreement to make it more favorable to the United States, submitting the letter closes the door to that possibility. Trump says the deal was costly for the United States, the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China.\n\nThe United States, under former President Barack Obama, had pledged under the Paris accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 to help slow global warming.\n\nAndrew Light, a former State Department official during the Obama administration that helped broker the Paris agreement, said the formal withdrawal would make it difficult for U.S. diplomats who participate in other discussions like the G7.\n\n\"It will take some time to recover from this train wreck of U.S. diplomacy,\" said Light, currently a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Valerie Volcovici and Alexandra Alper; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Peter Cooney)", "description": "", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Timothy Gardner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Uor.DzAZwvPZ5rIVNkbzMQ--~B/aD01MzM7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/reuters.com/a764c887a0e3eb7dfebbaf6d4fe961bf", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
