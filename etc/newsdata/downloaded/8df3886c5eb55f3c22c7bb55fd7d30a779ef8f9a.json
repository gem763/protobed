But they're pretty cool trucks.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s recently established GM Defense subsidiary has unveiled a Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 pickup-based Infantry Squad Vehicle that is being considered for acquisition by the military branch. The trucks trade their pickup profiles for an open-top nine-passenger troop-toting configuration, with three rows of seating plus two side-facing seats in the rear. They\u2019re all equipped with four-point harnesses and the truck provides easy access since there are no doors, just a roll cage that offers attachments for gear. It can also be used to strap the truck under a UH-60 helicopter for a lift, unless you'd rather park it in a Ch-47 Chinook, where it fits just fine.\n\nGM says the vehicle shares 70 percent of its parts with the 4x4 Colorado ZR2, including a suspension that features unique Multimatic DSSV shocks that were originally developed for racing and sports cars. Their advanced design allows for high-speed running as well as high-jumping.\n\nAnd while the ZR2 is available with a gasoline V6, the test trucks use its optional 2.8-liter four-cylinder turbodiesel engine, which is rated at 186 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque.\n\n\u201cOur ISV entry is a fully-integrated platform that leverages decades of GM\u2019s engineering, manufacturing and quality expertise at scale to provide the most cost-efficient, reliable and effective answer possible to meet and exceed the Army\u2019s demanding requirements,\u201d GM Defense President David Albritton said about the proposal.\n\nGM President Mark Reuss added in a promotional video that \u201cit makes me so proud as an American to be able to prepare something like this that keeps our troops safe and keeps them on the leading and cutting edge of technology.\u201d\n\nTesting of the trucks will begin in November at the Army\u2019s Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland, where they will be competing against submissions from the teams of Oshkosh/Flyer Defense and SAIC/Polaris for a contract to be awarded in March to build 651 vehicles through 2024. The final per-vehicle price for the program has not been announced, but the production ZR2 starts at $42,000 and the aim of using it as the basis for the ISV is to keep costs as low as possible.", "description": "Not your average SUV.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
