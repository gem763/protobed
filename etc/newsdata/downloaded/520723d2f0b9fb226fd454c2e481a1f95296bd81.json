The total super asset pool is $2.8 trillion but is projected to rise to $5.4 trillion by 2029, according to KPMG.\n\nMost of the debate has focused on present-day wage impacts and long-run implications for household income and retirement.\n\nBut Dr Nassios and his colleagues wanted to explore the effect of a higher SG on Australia\u2019s macroeconomic stability, or vulnerability to economic shocks.\n\nTheir analysis, published in the latest edition of the Journal of Policy Modeling, breaks the SG rise into two components.\n\nThe first is an increase in the proportion of household savings that sit within the super sector. This is called the \u201cintermediation effect\u201d because it represents savings households would have made in the absence of an SG rate rise.\n\nRather than allocating these savings to housing equity and bank deposits, as households have a propensity to do, the money is instead allocated according to the super sector\u2019s asset allocation.\n\nDr Nassios and his colleagues estimate that the intermediation effect accounts for about 30 cents of each dollar of additional super contributions. The remaining 70 cents is new savings and materialises as an increase in the household savings rate. This is the \u201csavings effect\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are several ways in which an SG rise can diminish or enhance macroeconomic stability, the paper says.\n\nOn the downside, a higher SG increases private debt stocks relative to domestic income.\n\n\u201cSuperannuation funds do not invest directly in housing,\u201d the paper says. \u201cThis contrasts with households, who allocate 49 per cent of their financial assets outside superannuation to housing equity.\u201d As a result, there is less capital available to equity finance housing.\n\n\u201cA large part of this increase in private debt stocks we see when the SG rate rises is therefore driven by a rise in housing debt-to-equity ratios in Australia.\n\n\"Our simulations show that, in the long run, housing debt-to-equity ratio will be 120 basis points \u2013 or 1.2 per cent \u2013 higher than it otherwise would have been, in response to a 1 per cent rise in the SG rate.\n\n\"The corollary of this is that a rise in the SG rate of 2.5 per cent is expected to drive long-run housing debt-to-equity ratios approximately 3 per cent higher than they would have been at the current SG rate. This enhances vulnerabilities to asset price and income shocks.\u201d\n\nOffsetting this, two things happen to boost macroeconomic stability.\n\nFirst, because the savings effect increases the national savings rate, our reliance on foreign capital falls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReduced foreign financing dependency enhances macroeconomic stability because it better insulates Australia from the kinds of foreign credit supply shocks that materialised during the global financial crisis.\n\n\u201cAustralian banks found it difficult to raise offshore bond finance during the 2008 financial crisis, a key channel via which the crisis affected Australian macro stability,\u201d the paper says.\n\nAnd second, there is a deepening of the domestic market for bank bonds.\n\nWhile households do not buy bank bonds directly, superannuation funds do. As superannuation funds expand when the SG rate rises, so too does domestic demand for bank bonds. The Financial System Inquiry raised the shallow nature of the corporate bond market.\n\nAn SG rate rise therefore offers potential diversification benefits in Australian bank capital structures, the paper says.", "description": "Housing debt-to-equity ratios will be 3 per cent higher if the super guarantee rises to 12 per cent, but Australia will be less reliant on foreign capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2606%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_53/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1d6a07c0de2f897f6c16b107d8f7c97c26477422", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
