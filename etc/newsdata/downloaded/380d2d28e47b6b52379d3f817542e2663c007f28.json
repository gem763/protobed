This was temporarily lifted last year to allow women to watch the World Cup being streamed at a stadium in Tehran.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhile the sporting ban is not written into law, it is \"ruthlessly enforced\", says Human Rights Watch.\n\nFootball's governing body Fifa set a deadline of 31 August for Iran to allow women into stadiums - something the country has not yet guaranteed.\n\n\"We are aware of that tragedy and deeply regret it,\" a Fifa statement said. \"Fifa convey our condolences to the family and friends of Sahar and reiterate our calls on the Iranian authorities to ensure the freedom and safety of any women engaged in this legitimate fight to end the stadium ban for women in Iran.\"\n\nCalling the case \"heart-breaking\", Philip Luther from Amnesty International said her death showed the impact of Iran's \"appalling contempt for women's rights\".\n\n\"Her death must not be in vain. It must spur change in Iran if further tragedies are to be avoided in the future.\"\n\nThe woman's self-immolation has led to a lot of debate in Iran.\n\nMasoud Shojaei, the captain of the Iran men's football team, said on Instagram that the ban is \"rooted in outdated and cringe-worthy thoughts that will not be understood by future generations\".\n\nEarlier this month, Iranians started campaigning online for world sporting organisations to ban the country from competitions to stop what they see as state interference in sports.", "description": "She was on trial for entering a football stadium disguised as a man - a punishable offence in Iran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DFF5/production/_108733375_gettyimages-975374276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
