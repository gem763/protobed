While Mr Trump was effectively neck-and-neck against Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders in the same July poll, but those four candidates all beat him now by at least four per cent, with Mr Sanders taking a nine-point lead.\n\nThe poll showed the president trailing by even wider margins among women, with former Vice President Joe Biden president holding a 30-point lead over Mr Trump among the voting bloc. Ms Harris, Ms Warren and Mr Sanders all hold over 20-point leads among women against the president as well.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The former vice president also had a 16-point lead against Mr Trump in the latest Quinnipiac polling.\n\nWhile the former vice president remains the frontrunner to beat Mr Trump in a variety of national polls, candidates like Ms Warren, Ms Harris and Mr Sanders have also made significant gains against Mr Biden and there are still several months to go before the first round of primary voting in February.\n\nThe poll generally reflects other national surveys that all seem to show each of the top five candidates (and several others) holding leads against Mr Trump. That fact alone should cause doubt about the president\u2019s claims that it is a \u201cphony suppression poll\u201d that was released as part of a coordinated effort between polling companies, media entities and their alleged \u201cDemocrat partners\u201d. Moreover, that is not how polling works, and the nationwide joint-poll has been tracking public opinion about the 2020 race for months.\n\nMr Trump is correct in stating the poll is \u201chypothetical\u201d. That is true because all polls are hypothetical.\n\nPolling reflects snapshots in time of voters\u2019 attitudes towards candidates and cannot predict outcomes with 100 per cent accuracy. However, the significant gains seen by Democratic candidates against the president \u2014 at a time when his approval rating appears to be dipping from his career high of 44 per cent in the middle of the summer \u2014 may show weakening support for a second term of Mr Trump's presidency.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Trump also stirred controversy when he suggested hosting the next G7 summit at his financially-struggling resort in Florida \u2014 a move House Democrats have vowed to investigate.\n\nThe next round of Democratic debates on Thursday will likely play a role in determining whether Mr Biden can maintain his status as the clear frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the general election, or if any of the other candidates can break out and finally take a lead over the former vice president.", "description": "Donald Trump has\u00a0vented his anger after a new poll\u00a0suggested he would lose the 2020 election against all of the leading\u00a0Democratic candidates.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/19/front-trump-11-september-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
