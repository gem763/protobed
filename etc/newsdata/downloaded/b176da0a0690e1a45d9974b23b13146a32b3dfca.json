That said, we can always use more, so email me if you're interested in telling your story.\n\nI like to take these milestones to stop and pause (like I did when we completed the first 100), to look back at what we've learned so far. That's what I'd like to do today.\n\nMillionaires are what I expected\n\nBefore we get too far, I have to acknowledge that the findings from these interviews don't surprise me much.\n\nThis is because these are my people. I'm one of the group (now over $4 million!) so I knew what to expect. How else do you think I came up with E, S, and I?\n\nThat said, there are some nuances that did surprise me a bit.\n\nSo I'll break this post into two major parts \u2014 findings I expected and the ones that were at least partial revelations to me. I'll also compare and contrast what the millionaires have done to the actions we've taken in our lives.\n\nLet's get started. First, here are the findings I was pretty sure of:", "description": "Now that John from ESI Money has interviewed 150 millionaires, he's found some of the patterns to be expected \u2014 but others to be a complete surprise.", "authors": ["Esi Money"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b52bd754caa2edf700577?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
