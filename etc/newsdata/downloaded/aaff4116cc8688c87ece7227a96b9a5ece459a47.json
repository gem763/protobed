If it's the latter, be prepared for a financial hit.\n\nBut that's not preventing people from flipping houses. American homeowners flipped 217,000 single-family homes or condos in 2017, the most in 11 years, reported Ronda Kaysen of The New York Times, citing real estate data company ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nBut flipping houses isn't as easy as reality TV makes it out to be \u2014 or as quick. We talked to several people who have been through the process of flipping a house more than once, and many said the real-life timeline of house flipping is longer than depicted. The consensus? You need to be prepared for unforeseen circumstances, especially going over budget.\n\nYou're also bound to learn the hard way from mistakes.

Sometimes, a flipped house will take longer to sell or won't sell for as much as you anticipated, decreasing your profit.\n\nBut that's not to say house flipping can't be rewarding \u2014 or a good investment \u2014 especially if you love doing it.\n\nHere's what house flipping is really like, according to house flippers themselves.", "description": "House flipping isn't all HGTV makes it out to be.
