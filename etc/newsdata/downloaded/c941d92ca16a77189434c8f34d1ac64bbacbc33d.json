'When the board sign a manager like Unai, they know it's all going to be part of a process.\n\n'He has his ideas and he's done so well at Sevilla and Valencia and Paris \u2013 so everyone trusts in the manager.\n\n'Sometimes things don't go your way but then it's about turning it around. I think if you take out from last season those three games which we lost \u2013 it would have been a very positive season and turned out another way.\n\nThe right-back says Emery deserves respect for his achievements at PSG and Sevilla\n\nEmery is under pressure already after Arsenal's inconsistent start to the season\n\n'It is part of a process and I think we are improving as players and the manager is getting to know us every single day and for us it is to just to keep going forward with the head up.'\n\nBellerin made only his second start of the season in the late comeback victory against Vitoria on Thursday following nine months out with a knee injury.\n\nThe Spaniard admits it was a difficult time to be away from the sport he loves but said it gave him the chance to spend rare time with family and friends.\n\n'When something you love so much, for whatever reason, is stopping you from doing it, I don't think there is a worse thing.\n\n'But while the process has been really hard, I've also taken a lot of positives out if it \u2013 as a person and as a player.\n\n'I had family and friends with me and other distractions that in the past six years of my life I wasn't able to do while I was playing all the time, like being in my home town for two months.\n\n'Even though I was sitting on the sofa and couldn't move, it was a long time since I'd been able to enjoy my friends and family. When life takes things from you, it gives you other positives and always important to look at the brighter side.\n\n'I am feeling better every day. I am ready whenever the decision of the manager is to play me.'", "description": "Hector Bellerin insists under-pressure manager Unai Emery has the complete trust of all the Arsenal players despite the club's indifferent start to the season.", "authors": ["James Sharpe For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20227026-0-image-a-11_1572125837329.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
