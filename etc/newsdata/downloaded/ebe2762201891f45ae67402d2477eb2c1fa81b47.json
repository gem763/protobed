Before the exit of its finance chief, M&S saw other top executives leave, including the head of its clothing business, Jill McDonald.\n\nThe company is looking to find \u00a3350 million ($436.3 million) in cumulative savings by fiscal 2020-21 through a mix of store closures, technology improvements and organizational changes. Around \u00a3100 million of that already has been achieved, the retailer said in its most recent annual report.\n\nM&S has been struggling with volatile sales in its food and clothing business while facing industrywide challenges such as rising commercial property taxes and Britain\u2019s coming departure from the European Union, which could result in distortions to supply chains, analysts said.\n\nA new finance chief succeeding Mr. Singer is expected to advance the cost-reduction efforts, analysts said. \u201cDelivering on the cost-savings plan is currently the single biggest role for the finance director,\u201d said Mr. Cochrane, adding that there would be little room for a new CFO to make significant changes to the current strategy.\n\nThe company plans to close stores while also reducing the number of employees in the head office. Outsourcing certain information technology functions is set to bring additional efficiencies, according to Mr. Cochrane.\n\nThe new CFO is likely also going to be involved with managing the financial implications of a deal that M&S struck with online food retailer Ocado Group PLC earlier this year. As part of the transaction, M&S got a 50% stake in Ocado\u2019s U.K. food delivery arm to boost its online offering.\n\nCost and revenue synergies are expected, analysts said, and M&S will have the chance to purchase the remaining part of the business in a few years.\n\nM&S financed a large part of the transaction with a rights issue. Its share price has declined around 20% since the beginning of the year, resulting in an exclusion from the FTSE 100 index of biggest companies in Britain that took effect Monday.\n\nManaging the financial consequences of Brexit, currently scheduled for Oct. 23, also could be among the tasks for a new CFO, analysts said. M&S sources part of its fresh produce from Continental Europe and a chaotic Brexit without a separation agreement between the U.K. and the EU could upend those supply chains, according to Eleonora Dani, an analyst at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.\n\nM&S didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for additional comment.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at nina.trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "The finance chief of British retailer Marks & Spencer is leaving after just over a year in the role, a move that comes in the middle of a turnaround effort.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110008/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
