We will come out on Oct. 31 and we will get it done.\u201d\n\nBut Ruffalo, 51, who has been embodying the Green One and his mild-mannered human alter ego Dr. Bruce Banner onscreen since the first \u201cAvengers\u201d movie in 2012, smashed that comparison to bits.\n\nHe tweeted on Sunday that the Hulk is much more powerful when working with his team \u2014 not running amok on his own.\n\n\u2018Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive.\u2019 Mark Ruffalo\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of a whole,\u201d Ruffalo wrote on Twitter TWTR, +0.30% . \u201cMad and strong can also be dense and destructive. The Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cPlus\u2026 he\u2019s always got Dr. Banner with science and reason.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole.

Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted that, \u201cThis is the kind of thing my kids would say aside from they would never make such glaring errors about The Hulk, I\u2019ve raised them properly.\u201d\n\nBrexit coordinator and Belgian political Guy Verhofstadt called the Hulk comparison \u201cinfantile\u201d even to \u201cTrumpian standards.\u201d\n\nEven to Trumpian standards the Hulk comparison is infantile. Is the EU supposed to be scared by this? The British public impressed? Is this Boris Johnson whistling in the dark? https://t.co/g6FwEQCTMG \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) September 15, 2019\n\nThe only similarity between Boris Johnson and the Incredible Hulk is that they both often wake up wondering where their trousers are. \u2014 Mr Roger Quimbly (@RogerQuimbly) September 15, 2019\n\nJohnson was scheduled to have his first meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday to seek out a longshot Brexit deal before next month\u2019s deadline.
