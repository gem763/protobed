It's needed before someone gets hurt, or in a team setting, before it becomes too much of a distraction. So understandably Cassel gave up after Brady's brutal series of pranks, but that didn't stop the offensive lineman from escalating it to the point where Bill Belichick had to get involved.\n\nStory continues\n\nI was done, I wiped my hands with it and said, \u2018I give,'\" Cassel said. \"The lineman decided to fill his car up with (foam) peanuts, put confetti in his air conditioning unit, and at that point, Bill had to step in and say, \u2018Look, guys, this isn't World War 4, okay. We can't have you guys going around hurting somebody or killing somebody.'\"\n\nThat was the end of it, or at least it appeared to be. Brady still wouldn't give Cassel his missing tire back.\n\n\"At the end of the day I did have to go home with my buddy for at least four days before he would give me back my other tire,\" Cassel said.\n\nSo again, don't get into a prank war with Brady. But if you do get into your own prank war, try to make sure you have more money than the other person.
