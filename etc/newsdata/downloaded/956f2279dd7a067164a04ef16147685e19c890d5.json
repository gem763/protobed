A mechanic found a tube underneath the cockpit that had been obstructed with foam, according to the paper.\n\nAlani glued the foam inside the tube leading from the outside of the plane to its air data module, federal prosecutors allege. The system reports the plane's speed and other flight data.\n\nHe reportedly told federal air marshals he was angry over stalled contract negotiations between the mechanics' union and the airline, which had hurt him financially. He allegedly said he didn't mean to harm anyone on board and had tampered with the aircraft's data module to cause a \"delay or have the flight canceled.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInvestigators said they suspected Alani after reviewing video footage. In it, he is said to be seen exiting a truck on the day of the flight and accessing the compartment where the navigation system was located.\n\nHe is expected to appear in court Friday.", "description": "An American Airlines employee, allegedly angry over stalled union contract talks with the company, has been accused of\u00a0disabling\u00a0the navigation system on a flight slated to take off from Miami over the summer, investigators said Thursday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Aircraft-Exterior-AA-737-Livery-Left-Front-Side.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
