Practice for the Japan Grand Prix also starts Friday in the western city of Suzuka.\n\nAn official from Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency (JMA) said the storm is currently as strong as four of the biggest typhoons to hit Japan in recent decades, including Faxai, which struck the Tokyo region last month causing widespread damage in the Chiba area.\n\nHagibis \u201cwill have a power that matches these four typhoons, and we expect maximum wind speeds of 45 metres per second (162 kilometres/100 miles per hour)\u201d on Saturday, the official said at a briefing.\n\n\u201cThe typhoon will bring heavy rains to a wide area\u2026 strong winds will come first, followed by rainstorms,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe ask residents to carry out voluntary evacuations at early stages, paying attention to evacuation advisories issued by local municipalities.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the JMA warned that \u201cis possible that violent winds, torrential rains, high waves and violent waves will be seen across the nation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the typhoon was churning above waters in Western Pacific, packing gusts up to 270 kilometres (170 miles) per hour, the weather agency said.\n\nThe current track has the storm veering towards Japan\u2019s central coast, but its final path remains uncertain.\n\nThe JMA organised the briefing in part because the country has a three-day weekend from Saturday through Monday, when many Japanese travel.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 A super typhoon among the most powerful in decades was set to hit Japan this holiday weekend, weather officials warned Wednesday, and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/5147da_man-reacts-as-waves-crash-seafront-on-enoshima-island-on-coast-kanagawa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
