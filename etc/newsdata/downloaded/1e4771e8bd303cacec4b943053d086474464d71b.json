There are a slew of reasons for the decline, but a trade war doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAt the epicenter of the crisis are soybean farmers. They've lost China, their biggest buyer, due to the trade war, and soybean prices have cratered as a result.\n\nBut many big farms have been able to circumvent the problem. One North Dakotan, whose farm is about 100 times the size of a typical one, shelled out $800,000 to buy steel bins that can hold excess soybeans until prices come back up, per Reuters. That's not an out available to most farmers.\n\nBigger retailers, like Walmart and Amazon, have also been able to stave off the trade war's effects.\n\n\u201cLarger retailers may be able to find alternative sources or be able to absorb a price increase without passing the cost on to their customers,\u201d David French, senior vice president of government relations for the National Retail Federation, tells the Washington Post. \u201cBut the smaller you are, the more vulnerable you are to the impact.\"\n\nSmaller retailers that are forced to raise prices will find it even harder to compete with the giants. American consumers are increasingly unwilling to accept price hikes on everyday goods, Axios' Courtenay Brown reports.\n\nBigger manufacturers are also faring better than their smaller counterparts.\n\nFor most American companies, China is a major part of the supply chain \u2014 and rejiggering a decades-old supply chain is costly and difficult, Duesterberg says. The big manufacturers have the resources to make these sweeping changes, and the small ones don't.\n\nIn some cases, the bigger players can even get Chinese exporters to cover some of the cost of the tariffs for them, says Duesterberg. \"They\u2019ve got more leverage\" because they're making massive orders.\n\nWhat to watch: Chinese officials will arrive in D.C. on Thursday for the latest round of trade negotiations with their American counterparts. Look for more small businesses to suffer \u2014 or even close their doors \u2014 if the parties fail to reach a deal.", "description": "Meanwhile, scores of American small businesses are losing profits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/KdFLAQUAhYbWUEoKeWInNgGYOlo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570666556789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
