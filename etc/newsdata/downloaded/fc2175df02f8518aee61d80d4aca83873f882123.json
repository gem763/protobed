Bunch III writes in his upcoming memoir that he had to refuse the extraordinary request from the incoming president in January 2017, the Washington Post reported over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe notion that we could shut out visitors on the first King holiday since the opening of the museum was not something I could accept,\u201d Mr. Bunch writes in his book \u201cA Fool\u2019s Errand: Creating the National Museum of African American History and Culture in the Age of Bush, Obama and Trump,\u201d according to the Post.\n\nMr. Trump eventually made his visit, accompanied by, among others, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and pro-life activist Alveda King, Dr. King\u2019s niece.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bunch\u2019s book, the visit went poorly as Mr. Trump \u201cwas in a foul mood and \u2026 did not want to see anything \u2018difficult.\u2019\u201d Among other things, when shown material on the Dutch role in the global slave trade Mr. Trump replied, \u201cYou know, they love me in the Netherlands.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I could say was \u2018let\u2019s continue walking,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bunch wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is little I remember about the rest of the hour we spent together. I was so disappointed in his response to one of the greatest crimes against humanity in history,\u201d Mr. Bunch\u2019s book continues. \u201cHere was a chance to broaden the views and the understanding of the incoming president and I had been less successful than I had expected.\u201d\n\nThe recollections of Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary and also present for the Feb. 21 tour, were that the incoming administration requested a date before the King holiday, precisely to minimize public disruption. He also told the Post the president was engaged, most especially on the museum\u2019s section on Mr. Carson\u2019s medical career. Mr. Bunch\u2019s book also says the president was taken by the material on Muhammad Ali.\n\n\u201cThe president and I shared our stories about Ali and what he meant to America,\u201d wrote Mr. Bunch, who was the black-history museum\u2019s founding director from 2005 to earlier this summer, when he became the Smithsonian\u2019s secretary.\n\nIn an interview with the Post, Mr. Bunch also reined in some of the criticism of the president made in his book, which was written last year.\n\nIn the book, he accuses Mr. Trump of deepening racial divides, citing his \u201ccombative relationship with many in the African American community\u201d and his purported \u201crefusal to criticize the white supremacists \u2026 rioting in Charlottesville.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind there were things he learned, engaged with,\u201d he told The Post about the visit described in the book. \u201cWhat I hope is that the Smithsonian can play that role in a time of partisanship and division. I\u2019m not saying who caused it, but the reality is, it\u2019s a different time. And so I just want us to play that role.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
