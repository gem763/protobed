Mayor Todd Strange did not seek re-election.\n\nThree City Council seats are still up for election after five were decided in the Aug. 27 election. City Council members and the mayor are elected to four year terms. The newly elected officials will be elected to serve from 2020 to 2024.\n\nLocal government officials are responsible for dealing with the city's problems. They're the most accessible to the average citizen. City politics and issues have the potential to influence the state and nation. It\u2019s also more feasible to hold local politicians accountable than it is to point the finger at national officials who can be more elusive.\n\nThe polls open Oct. 8. Here's what you need to know when you vote.\n\nWho will be the next mayor?\n\nMontgomery Probate Judge Steven Reed and TV station owner David Woods are competing in the runoff for mayor. Reed gained almost double the votes, 42%, as Woods in the August mayoral election against 10 other candidates. Woods had around 24% of the votes, beating out 10 other candidates to face Reed in the runoff. The winner will be sworn in as mayor Nov. 12 at Montgomery City Hall.\n\nThe mayor makes recommendations to the City Council, appoints staff, sets salaries and keeps the City Council informed on finances. The mayor appoints the finance director, executive assistant, sanitation director, street maintenance director, parks and recreation director.\n\nCity officials tried to increase the mayor's salary to $125,000 last year but were unsuccessful. The mayor gets paid $95,000 per year.\n\nMontgomery mayors typically stay in office longer than the four-year term. The past three mayors have stayed in office longer than average. Elected in 2009, Strange has been in office for a decade. Before him, Bobby Bright was also in office for a decade and the mayor before him, Emory Folmar, more than two decades.\n\nThe city could be on the verge of electing its first black mayor. Montgomery is one of the rare cities of its size in the South that has not elected an African American mayor.\n\nSteven Reed\n\nSteven Reed was elected Montgomery\u2019s first African American probate judge in 2012. In 2015, he was the first probate judge in Alabama to issue same-sex marriage licenses. He was re-elected in 2018.\n\nHe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996 in business administration with a focus in finance from Morehouse. He received a master's degree from Vanderbilt University in 2004. He was senior aide for four years to former-Lieutenant Gov. Jim Folsom Jr. who served as lieutenant governor from 2006 to 2010.\n\nReed attended Cloverdale Junior High and Jeff Davis High School. He opened a restaurant, Roly Poly Sandwiches in 2005. He's also worked for a management consulting firm.\n\nHe decided to run for mayor to address Montgomery's challenges like public education and safety. He talked about elevating the economy by being more receptive and supportive of young talent and making the off pace city more competitive.\n\n\u25ba Steven Reed:Growing up the son of a politician informs Steven Reed's parenting\n\nDavid Woods\n\nDavid Woods has owned WCOV/Fox television station since 1985. He financially supports and volunteers for organizations that deliver supplies, drill wells, renovate schools and provide health clinics to poverty-stricken areas in African nations.\n\nSince 2007, he's donated and volunteered for Forgotten Children Ministries, a missionary organization providing services to children in Honduras.\n\nWoods studied broadcasting at University of Alabama. After college, he worked as a doorman for three years at a hotel in San Diego before managing his father's television stations.\n\nHe plans to enhance public schools with his influence, and address the issue of unsupervised children by reopening community centers. He said he would solicit businesses to sponsor the centers in exchange for brand advertising. He plans to tackle the issue of blight by demolishing buildings, creating vacant lots and turning them into parks.\n\n\u25ba David Woods:David Woods attributes his passion for philanthropy to his father\n\nCity Council candidates\n\nThere are three seats open on the City Council to represent District 3, District 5, and District 6. Like the mayor, City Council members are elected to a four year term. City Council meetings are open to the public and accept public comment.\n\nCity Council members make decisions on policy, proposing laws, passing codes and approving the budget.\n\nAfrican American and female representation on the Montgomery City Council will be disproportionate when compared to the city's racial and gender composition for another term.\n\nThe City Council will remain made up of four African American council members and five white male council members regardless of the outcome of the Oct. 8 runoff since five white men won seats in the Aug. 27 election.\n\nThe ratio of males to females on the City Council was also disproportionate to Montgomery's population for the 2015 to 2019 term and that will remain the same. Of the remaining candidates going to the runoff, two are women and four are men.\n\nDistrict 3: Tracy Larkin, Marche Johnson\n\nTracy Larkin is an U.S. army veteran of three years. He was elected to the City Council in 1999 and has served four terms non consecutively. Larkin was a Democratic candidate for the Alabama State House of Representatives in 2014. Larkin is a due-process hearing officer at the MPS Central Office of Student Services.\n\nMarche Johnson is an Army veteran who was born and raised in Montgomery. She lived in Trenholm Court and Sheridan Heights neighborhoods. She has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Troy University.\n\nDistrict 5: C.C. Calhoun, Phyllis Harvey-Hall\n\nCornelius Calhoun is a former City Council member who served from 2003 to 2015. He's also a retired U.S. Army 1st Class Sergeant. He's an ROTC instructor at Sidney Lanier High School and deacon at First Baptist Church of Greater Washington Park.\n\nPhyllis Harvey-Hall was an elementary school teacher with Montgomery Public Schools for 25 years prior to retirement. She's a former prevention educator for the Family Sunshine Center. She does part-time consulting for the National Association of Educational Progress.\n\nDistrict 6: Oronde Mitchell, Jon Dow\n\nOronde Mitchell is a Montgomery Public Schools resource officer. He ran against his current opponent, John Dow, for City Council in 2015. Mitchell has owned a mobile car wash company, City Hand Car Wash, since 2003.\n\nJonathon Dow was a Montgomery councilman from 2011 to 2015. He ran for mayor in 2007. While on the council, he was a district recruiter for Alabama State University for four years.\n\n\u25ba Council election:Race/gender makeup will remain disproportionate to Montgomery's population\n\nElection Center not open Election Day\n\nVoting results will not be projected at the Election Center. Results will be projected in real time at Montgomery City Hall. Police officers will pick up the memory sticks at polling locations and bring them to the Election Center where the memory sticks will be read in the tabulation room. The election team, the city clerk and the chief of police will all be at the Election Center. Once the polls close, the Election Center will not be open.\n\nElection Center staff told the Advertiser that Montgomery City Hall has a larger venue with better parking.\n\nWhat does it mean that the election is being monitored?\n\nIn the Aug. 27 election, poll workers removed memory devices from voting machines before information was downloaded causing a delay in results.\n\nMemory devices containing voting information for Districts 5 and 6 were unreadable and a court order had to be granted to receive the ballots for two precincts, so the Election Center could re-run them.\n\nThe first results for the municipal election were announced about 90 minutes after the polls closed. The returns in such a small election are typically announced much sooner in Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery City Clerk Brenda Blalock said the error was not intentional or criminal.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of State will be observing the election to ensure no irregularities occur. Five monitoring teams of two staff members will observe the polls during the Oct. 8 runoff. The teams will be there from when polls open at 7 a.m. until they close at 7 p.m.\n\n\u25ba Memory card mystery:Did human error or faulty devices cause Montgomery election results delay?\n\n\u25ba Mayoral runoff:After election complaints, Secretary of State promises to keep close watch on Montgomery mayoral runoff\n\nExpected turnout\n\nSecretary of State John Merrill does not release predictions for municipal elections. Based on knowledge from previous municipal elections, Merrill expects 60% of the voter turnout from the Aug. 27 election to vote in the runoff. Based on turnout from previous elections, Merrill expects around 26,000 people to vote.\n\nBecause there will not be a runoff for all nine City Council Districts, the full 43,746 voters (31.33% of the number of registered voters in the district) who participated in the Aug. 27 election are not expected to vote Oct. 8.\n\nSara MacNeil can be reached at smacneil@montgome.gannett.com.
