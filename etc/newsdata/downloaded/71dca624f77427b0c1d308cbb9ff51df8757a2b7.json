In an interview published on Friday, Mr McDonnell \u2013 who at 68 is only two years younger than Mr Corbyn \u2013 said he and the leader would have to quit if Labour lost the next Election.\n\nHe also appeared to rule himself out of stepping into Mr Corbyn\u2019s shoes in any event, saying \u2018whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman\u2019.\n\nHe mentioned party schools spokeswoman Angela Rayner as a contender, although Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey is thought to be Mr McDonnell\u2019s preferred candidate.\n\nCorbyn critic Jess Phillips reacted by saying she might stand for the leadership if the 70-year-old quit.\n\nThere are even suggestions the Labour leader would formally stand aside to let pro-Remain Mr McDonnell become interim Prime Minister\n\nThe claims emerged amid reports that Mr McDonnell, one of Mr Corbyn\u2019s oldest political allies, was behind last week\u2019s alleged \u2018demotion\u2019 of key Corbyn aide Karie Murphy\n\nBut senior party sources said Mr McDonnell could still take over as leader if the General Election is postponed until next spring.\n\nOne said: \u2018It\u2019s clear what\u2019s going on here is a battle over Jeremy\u2019s succession, with him and McDonnell keen to ensure the Left \u2013 and not the moderates \u2013 stay on top.\n\n\u2018Obviously, if there\u2019s an Election before Christmas, Jeremy leads us into it. But if not, John could very well take over even if only on a temporary basis. If we end up having a second referendum rather than an early Election, Corbyn may well call it a day. He looks really tired and he won\u2019t want to lead us in another referendum campaign.\u2019\n\nThe source added that Mr McDonnell was likely to win more support than deputy leader Tom Watson as the only figure capable of \u2018bridging the gap\u2019 between Corbynistas and moderates.\n\nInsiders also claim Mr McDonnell is the only Labour figure Mr Corbyn would step aside for to head a coalition anti-No Deal government, given that Liberal Democrats and Tory rebels have vowed never to put Mr Corbyn into No 10.\n\nSenior Lib Dem MPs dismissed the prospect last night, saying the Shadow Chancellor was \u2018just as toxic\u2019 as Mr Corbyn for them.\n\nSources close to Mr Corbyn last night said there was \u2018no question\u2019 of him standing down if there was no early Election, insisting he was \u2018fighting fit\u2019. They also said that he \u2013 not Mr McDonnell \u2013 took \u2018all major decisions\u2019.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr McDonnell dismissed talk of leadership ambition on his part as \u2018rubbish\u2019 and said he was not responsible for staffing in the leader\u2019s office nor in the party\u2019s HQ.", "description": "Insiders said the Shadow Chancellor is in day-to-day charge of the party with Mr Corbyn happy for his long-term ally to 'run the show' and maintain the Left's grip on the party.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor", "Brendan Carlin For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19635856-0-image-a-12_1570912555204.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
