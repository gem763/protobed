The driver gave no indication at the time that a mess was made, and I left the vehicle in the state that I found it.\n\nMr Hancock says there is no way the damage in the car was from his journey (Picture: Oliver Hancock)\n\n\u2018I was sent two photos from Uber of the supposed damage I had done, which I believe are fake, from a different incident or were created by the driver in retaliation to the poor review and complaint I made.\u2019\n\nMr Hancock says the system at Uber is \u2018extremely flawed and easily abused\u2019.\n\nHe said he totally appreciated that a \u2018driver\u2019s car is how they make their money\u2019 and would be \u2018happy to pay if he had done any damage\u2019.\n\nMr Hancock claims that Uber has unfairly sided with the driver, \u2018based on two photographs\u2019 and that he has not been provided with any opportunity to refute this.\n\nCould a no-deal Brexit still happen?\n\nHe added: \u2018Their system does not allow any mitigation, or any response from the customer and only requires a driver to send some photographs through the app in order to pass on an extortionate charge to the customer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Uber spokeswoman said: \u2018The Uber app is based on mutual respect for both riders and drivers.\n\n\u2018For licensed drivers who use the app, their vehicles are their place of work and any damage or mess can mean they are unable to continue working.\n\n\u2018When a driver claims a cleaning fee, they are required to provide us with the details of the trip, the passengers and the incident itself, as well as photographic evidence and a validated cleaning receipt which our support team then investigates.\n\n\u2018In this instance, we have refunded the rider. We are constantly evaluating our processes and technology related to these claims and will take appropriate action whenever fraud may be detected.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
