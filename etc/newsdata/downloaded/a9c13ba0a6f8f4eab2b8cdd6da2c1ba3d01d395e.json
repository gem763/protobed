Both sides said deputy-level officials would work together in mid-September to lay the groundwork.\n\nPlans to meet in person come as both sides ramp up punitive tariffs on each other; the U.S. plans to raise them even more. U.S. tariffs of 15% on $300 billion worth of mostly consumer items from China are coming into effect. China is retaliating, hitting items like American soybeans with higher tariffs. And it is letting the yuan depreciate to help mitigate the impact of the levies.\n\nU.S. tariffs of 25% on $250 billion of Chinese imports, largely on items used by businesses, are set to rise to 30% on Oct. 1, likely before the next round of trade talks can conclude.\n\nChinese state TV said the two sides plan to work together and \"create favorable conditions\" for the negotiations.\n\nWilliam Mauldin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 04, 2019 22:52 ET (02:52 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
