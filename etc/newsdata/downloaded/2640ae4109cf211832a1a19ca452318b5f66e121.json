Their one-hour meeting started at the serene Fisherman's Cove resort and then continued on the beach washed by the Bay of Bengal, according to Indian media.\n\nIt mostly revolved around economic cooperation and struggle against extremism that plagues both India and China. Modi in Xi had also apparently tried to iron out wrinkles that emerged after New Delhi revoked autonomy status of its Jammu and Kashmir state that borders China.\n\n\u201cWe had decided that we will manage our differences prudently and won't allow them to turn into disputes,\u201d Modi told Xi, to which he replied: \u201cYesterday Prime Minister as you said, you and I had engaged in candid conversations like friends, heart to heart discussions on bilateral relations. And, I look forward to further discussions.\u201d\n\n#ChennaiConnect | A relationship with a canvas as broad as the ocean\n\n\n\nPM @narendramodi & Chinese President Xi continue their discussions on 2nd day of Informal Summit.

Modi, a conservative Hindu politician, said India and China have been economic powers that traded with one another \u201cfor the most part of the last 2000 years.\u201d He recalled their first informal summit at China\u2019s Wuhan last year that gave \u201ca fresh momentum\u201d and boosted \u201cstrategic communication between our two countries.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s one-in-one spelled \u201cthe start of a new era in India-China relations,\u201d PM Modi offered.\n\nEarlier on Friday, he unleashed a charm offensive on XI, taking him on a personal tour of temples and monuments in the coastal town of Mamallapuram which has historical India-China ties.PHOTOThey also had extensive talks over dinner at which Xi was treated to range of local specialties from the region.\n\nMamallapuram is one of the most beautiful places in India, full of vibrancy. It is linked to commerce, spirituality and is now a popular tourism centre.\n\n\n\nI am delighted that President Xi Jinping and I are spending time in this scenic place, which is also a @UNESCO heritage site. pic.twitter.com/5oH95Rh34p \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 11, 2019\n\nThat meeting went beyond schedule, with the leaders talking for two and a half hours.
