which may require systematic overhauls to undo - he says that hospitals could easily avoid administrative wastes by doing things like updating and ensuring the properly code these services.\n\nHe says that the use of outdated, ineffective medicines is similarly little more than laziness from doctors who don't bother to keep up or change with shifting industry standards.\n\nBut the more insidious and, in Dr Berwick's opinion, most 'plausible' explanation for the waste of so much money in health care, is politics.\n\nHe notes that this waste goes to the pockets of health care, pharmaceutical and medical corporations.\n\nThe more they make - even when those profits are gleaned from poor treatment and overcharges - the more powerful the sway of these corporate lobbies over politics is, and the more likely the same problems, wastes and price hikes can continue.\n\n'In large measure, the challenge of removing waste from US health care and reinvesting that harvest where it could do much more good is not a technical one,' wrote Dr Bernick.\n\n'It is a political one.\n\n'In short, removing waste from US health care will require both awakening a sleepy status quo and shifting power to wrest it from the grip of greed.'", "description": "The amount of money 'wasted' on health care -
