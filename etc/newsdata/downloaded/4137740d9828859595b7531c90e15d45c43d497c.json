So far, no connection between the meetings and the De Sousa case has been reported.\n\nAndrea Saccucci, an Italian lawyer who has submitted an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of De Sousa, confirmed on Sunday that his client had left Italy but could not explain why De Sousa had returned to the United States despite her fears about the U.S. administration.\n\n\"She only told me that she is now in the States,\" Saccucci told Reuters.\n\nIl Corriere quoted De Sousa as saying that \"thanks to the recent changes to the Whistleblower Act\" she could reveal further details on the case.\n\nThe kidnapping of Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was part of a CIA \"extraordinary rendition\" program to snatch terrorism suspects in various countries and transfer them in secret to undergo interrogation in third countries.\n\nThe cleric said he was tortured after being transferred to Egypt under the program, an aspect of President George W. Bush\u2019s \"war on terror\" that drew condemnation from human rights groups and even some U.S. allies.\n\nDe Sousa has always claimed her innocence, saying she was not in Milan on the day of the abduction and did not plan the kidnap.\n\n(Reporting by Giselda Vagnoni; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "description": "ROME (Reuters) - A former U.S. spy, pardoned by Italy in connection with the CIA kidnapping of a terrorism suspect in Milan, has fled from Italy to the United States fearing for her safety, Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera on Sunday quoted her as saying.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
