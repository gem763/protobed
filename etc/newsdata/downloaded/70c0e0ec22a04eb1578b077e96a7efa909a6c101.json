Her blue sandals clicked on the hardwood floor, echoing off the empty green walls of the two-bedroom rent-controlled apartment in Northwest Washington where she had spent the past 40 years of her life. Reluctantly, she spun from one room to the next, packing boxes, folding sheets, unfolding sheets, opening cupboards, closing cupboards, doing a mental inventory.\n\nWhat to take? What not to take? Where would she and her family live now? She hadn\u2019t looked for an apartment since everyone called D.C. by its old nickname: Chocolate City.\n\nNow that city was vanishing, and so was Sanathera Price\u2019s place in it.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to move,\u201d said Price, 61, sinking into a chair in the living room of her beloved apartment in the 1800 block of 13th Street NW. \u201cMy time is up, I guess. I know I have to move. But I\u2019m stuck.\u201d\n\nHer emotions welled up in the thick, oppressive summer heat inside the apartment. The air conditioning was broken, and the fan had stopped spinning in the living room. She opened a window that faced a red brick wall.

Construction workers hammered and drilled, transforming an apartment building two doors down into condos that will sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Tourists with rolling bags swept in and out of the huge brownstone mansion next door that has become a bustling bed-and-breakfast. Millennials sped up and down the sidewalk on scooters. The corner store across the street at 13th and T had begun selling organic milk to cater to the newcomers. Rowhouses around the corner where black people once lived were being gutted, renovated and flipped. Now her own building was being emptied of its last tenants to be remade into something far fancier, something she knew she would never be able to afford. Price had to pack, move and turn in her keys before Labor Day.\n\n\n\nPrice, with help from her granddaughter Zahara Hilliard, 6, packs up her belongings ahead of the move from her longtime apartment. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nShe\u2019d planned to stay here until she became an old lady, in a building that sits just off U Street, a corridor known as Black Broadway. Next door to her was the historic century-old Whitelaw Hotel, designed by noted African American architect Isaiah T. Hatton. Down the street: a childhood home of Duke Ellington.\n\nShe\u2019d moved to this block in Shaw when she was a mother in her 20s, raising three children and a nephew in a neighborhood that was once mostly black and is now overwhelmingly white.\n\nShe paid $525 a month to rent her two-bedroom apartment \u2014 at least $1,500 less than what many apartments in this neighborhood now commanded.\n\nPrice was wearing a blue summer dress and her thick hair was plaited in two French braids. She\u2019d just gotten off work at the Social Security Administration office in Northeast Washington, where she has worked for as long as she has lived in this apartment.\n\n\u201cI am the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like change,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent 40 years in the same job; 40 years in the same apartment.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d cooked and cleaned at 1829 13th Street NW, first on the building\u2019s third floor and later on the first floor. There were Christmas trees, home-cooked meals and first-day-of-school photos. And there was loss.\n\n\n\nThe Whitelaw Hotel, at 1839 13th St. NW, was described in 1919 as the \"first hotel apartment of its size built for the exclusive use of colored people in this country.\" (Library of Congress/Library of Congress)\n\nOne day in 2001, her husband, Walter Hilliard, got out of bed at 4:30 a.m. to get to his job as a dump truck driver. Suddenly, he fell to the bedroom floor.\n\n\u201cI jumped up, turned on the light and found him,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHis mouth was twisted, but he kept saying, \u2018I\u2019m all right. Just give me a minute.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t. He was taken to a hospital with an aneurysm that eventually killed him at age 53.\n\n\u201cHe never came back home,\u201d she said.\n\nNow she lived in the apartment with her second husband, Elgin Allen, one of her sons, and two of her 10 grandchildren.\n\nThrough it all, Price said, her biggest fear was \u201cgetting put out. I never wanted to be put out.\u201d\n\nAfter four decades of dutifully paying her rent, that\u2019s exactly what was happening.\n\n\n\nIn Shaw and across the District, affluent white people have moved in, forcing less affluent black people out. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018More and more expensive\u2019\n\nPrice is among thousands of people being displaced in the nation\u2019s capital by warp-speed gentrification.\n\nIn Columbia Heights, Capitol Hill, Navy Yard and other neighborhoods, affluent white people have moved into the city, forcing less affluent black people out of the city.\n\nThe District has one the nation\u2019s highest displacement rates for low-income residents, according to a study by the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity, which investigates social and economic disparities in the United States.\n\n[Gentrification in D.C. means widespread displacement, study finds]\n\n\u201cWe see over and over again, D.C. is getting more and more expensive with incentives for owners to turn buildings into luxury condos,\u201d said Lori Leibowitz, managing attorney for the Neighborhood Legal Services Program. \u201cAs that process happens, our clients \u2014 many of them are black, and longtime residents \u2014 are getting pushed out of D.C.\u201d\n\nThe forces of displacement arrived at Price\u2019s doorstep five years ago, when her 14-unit building was sold by Talley R. Holmes Jr., a black lawyer and real estate magnate, to Clydeco 2013 LLC for $2.8 million. It is now worth an estimated $6 million, according to Redfin.\n\nThe residents formed an association under the city\u2019s Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives tenants a chance to buy the building where they live. It also provides some negotiating leverage.\n\nClydeco and its agent, Frederick Silvers, assured Price and her neighbors that they would not have to move, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe toll of gentrification I really don't want to move. My time is up, I guess. I know I have to move. But I\u2019m stuck. Sanathera Price I\u2019m part of the change. I feel bad. There is one [black-owned] house left on this block. An original elderly couple who have been here a long time. When I moved here, there were more. I feel like they are being pushed out, but they are making millions on the houses they\u2019ve had for so long. a homeowner who moved to the block five years ago We see over and over again, D.C. is getting more and more expensive with incentives for owners to turn buildings into luxury condos.

Lori Leibowitz, managing attorney for the Neighborhood Legal Services Program\n\nThe battered brick building, which was built in 1956, needed refurbishment. So the tenants voted to trade their purchase rights for repairs and a guarantee that they could remain in their rent-controlled apartments.\n\nBut most of the promised repairs never happened, and several months after the purchase was complete, the tenants filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court, claiming that Clydeco \u201chad been lying during the negotiations.\u201d According to the complaint, at the same time \u201cit was telling the Building\u2019s residents that it intended to operate the Building as a rental property for the long term and that they could stay in their homes, it was telling its lenders that it planned to convert the Building to condominiums and sell the units for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Clydeco denied the allegations in a motion to dismiss the case. When reached by a reporter, one of the attorneys said he could not comment on the case, which was settled in June. The terms of the settlement were confidential.\n\nPrice, one of the last holdouts, had no choice. She had to pack up. Her 25-year-old daughter took the lead on looking for a new home for her mother. She checked out apartments in suburban Maryland. She researched a property for sale in Suitland.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice little house with a yard,\u201d Price said. But it was so far from the D.C. neighborhood she loved.\n\n\n\nA gathering on 13th Street NW, where white residents are displacing black residents. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018Who can afford that?\u2019\n\nEven with the settlement, Price wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a million-dollar condo in Shaw. Or rent the apartment advertised across the street for $3,500 a month.\n\n\u201cWho can afford that?\u201d she asked.\n\nA white woman walked by and told Price that she\u2019d seen the apartment, and that it was beautifully renovated. Price said she had no doubt that it was nice, but that it was beyond her means. The woman, who volunteered that she\u2019d \u201cinherited wealth,\u201d agreed with Price that the neighborhood had become extraordinarily expensive. Later, Price wondered what the woman meant by \u201cinherited wealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think she means, like, millions of dollars?\u201d she asked.\n\nShaw once boasted a concentration of African American wealth, epitomized by the Whitelaw Hotel. Built in 1919 by black entrepreneur John Whitelaw Lewis, the Whitelaw was a refuge during segregation when white-owned hotels refused to take bookings from African Americans. It drew legendary boxer Joe Lewis, bandleader Cab Calloway, and legal giants Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall. Duke Ellington, who lived in several houses in Shaw when he was growing up, also stayed at the hotel. A photo of his tab still hangs in the lobby.\n\n\n\nTrash is piled up in the formerly elegant ballroom of the historic Whitelaw. By the 1970s, the hotel had become a drug haven. (Library of Congress/Library of Congress)\n\n[The four days in 1968 that reshaped D.C.]\n\nThe Whitelaw was elegant, boasting its own ballroom. But with integration came its slow decline. Then Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and the 1968 uprising ripped through Shaw. By the 1970s, the hotel had become a drug haven. Trash piled up in the ballroom.\n\nA detective told The Washington Post in 1977 that on almost any given day inside the Whitelaw, one might find \u201ca drug addict crawling around the halls with a needle in his arm. Or somebody would stumble over you with a sawed-off shotgun. Or you\u2019d stop a guy to ask him a few questions and a packet of dope would fall out of his pocket.\u201d\n\nThat year, the D.C. government decided to close the Whitelaw for building code violations.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t live there. The riots destroyed the neighborhood back in \u201968 and then the Whitelaw turned into a place you were lucky to come out alive,\u201d said Jim Dickerson, founder of Manna, a nonprofit group that renovated the hotel and turned it into an affordable apartment building in 1991.\n\nMae Green moved into the Whitelaw in 1999. By then, white people were starting to buy in Shaw, but it still felt like her community. Twenty years later, that\u2019s no longer true, she said.\n\n\u201cLike, you can go into the Rite Aid, and you will see 48 boxes of hair color and only three for a person of color,\u201d said Green, who is black and works as a security guard downtown. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t make sense because we were here. We are still here. But it\u2019s almost as if you don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn this street in Shaw, apartment buildings are being turned into luxury condos, and rowhouses are being gutted, renovated and flipped. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nGreen and Price talked over the wrought-iron fence surrounding a patch of grass where their children once played. Their longtime neighbor Kia Hopkins, 44, a nursing assistant who has lived in the Whitelaw for 20 years, stopped to say hello. Hopkins said that the newcomers make her feel invisible.\n\n\u201cSometimes, they look at you like, \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 Or they bump you,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cJust now, a lady let her dog come up on my leg. She didn\u2019t say anything\u201d or apologize. She just kept walking in the direction of Black Broadway, she added.\n\nPrice recounted what happened during her annual Fourth of July cookout in 2018. White neighbors, she said, \u201ccalled the police. They said the music is too loud. But across the street they can have a party on the sidewalk, and nobody says a thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter the Whitelaw fell into disrepair, Manna, a nonprofit group, renovated the hotel and turned it into an affordable apartment building in 1991. (Library of Congress/Library of Congress)\n\n\u2018A wreck when I bought it\u2019\n\nPrice waved to another longtime neighbor, Gary Hyde, a white man who bought in Shaw long before it was gentrified.\n\nHyde, a federal worker, waved back. He walked up the stairs to his brownstone, where he lives and runs a bed-and-breakfast. The brownstone is sandwiched between Price\u2019s apartment building and another brick apartment building, which he also owns and is turning into condos. Inside his house, jazz is playing. The living room is decorated with oil paintings and antiques. The afternoon light streams though the curved bay window over a piano that Ellington once played.\n\nHyde flipped through photos of what the brownstone, which had been used as a halfway house, once looked like.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty much a wreck when I bought it\u201d in 1999, he said. It had no kitchen. There were drop ceilings and fluorescent lighting throughout. \u201cI did almost all the work \u2014 except plumbing and wiring.\u201d\n\n\n\nGary Hyde outside his brownstone in Shaw, where he has renovated 12 houses. He owns the adjacent apartment building, which is being transformed into luxury condos. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nHe paid $525,000 for the brownstone and the attached apartment building, which lacked a separate entrance back then. Now the brownstone alone is assessed at $1.1 million, according to D.C. tax records. The apartment building at 1825 13th Street NW is being transformed into a six-unit luxury condo building called the Boss Shepherd. It\u2019s named for an influential figure in 19th century Washington \u2014 a white man who helped transform the city.\n\nHyde has renovated 12 houses in Shaw, now a far more desirable and expensive neighborhood than when he arrived in 1985. Nearly all his neighbors were black then, but he doesn\u2019t consider himself a gentrifier. He said he helped stabilize the neighborhood and save houses from collapse, including one around the corner at 12th and T streets.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked through the door the first time, I fell through the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people think about that when they say gentrification is terrible across the board.\u201d\n\nBogdan Builders is converting this 13th Street brownstone, built in 1891 into luxury condominiums.

The sidewalk in front of the red rowhouse memorializes Price\u2019s son Wesley, who wrote his name in the wet cement.\n\nPrice pointed to a house that a black pastor and his wife once owned.\n\n\u201cHe was this man who every morning got up and cleaned the whole street all the way to T,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAcross the street was the home of a black doctor.\u201d\n\nBut that man was gone and so was the black family that used to live next to him, and the family that lived next to them.\n\nPrice kept walking, like a tour guide explaining the history of her neighborhood. She stopped at a house that used to be a church.\n\nSuddenly, a voice came from over the house\u2019s low wrought-iron fence.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a church,\u201d said a white man drinking a glass of white wine on the front lawn. The homeowner, a real estate agent, moved here five years ago.\n\n\u201cAre you still in the neighborhood?\u201d he asked Price.\n\nShe told him she still lived around the corner.\n\nHe said he knows gentrification has caused displacement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of the change,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel bad. There is one [black-owned] house left on this block. An original elderly couple who have been here a long time. When I moved here, there were more. I feel like they are being pushed out, but they are making millions on the houses they\u2019ve had for so long.\u201d\n\nHe said he can sometimes feel the resentment when he passes black people on the street. \"We are a Friday hot spot for African Americans who come in from suburbs,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe Whitelaw is now an affordable apartment complex. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nPrice interrupted: \u201cYou think it\u2019s African Americans from the suburbs or African Americans who moved out and are coming back to their neighborhoods?\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know.\n\nPrice ended the conversation by inviting him to her annual summer cookout: \u201cWe barbecue. We play cards. I always invite all the neighbors.\u201d\n\nThe man politely declined. He\u2019d be at his beach house, he said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell him that she won\u2019t be his neighbor much longer.\n\n\n\nSanathera Price wanted to grow old in this apartment building where she raised her children. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018This building was mine\u2019\n\nOne by one, the boxes were loaded into a friend\u2019s truck on a warm August night. After about an hour, Price\u2019s apartment was empty.\n\nShe did one last walk through, remembering all that had passed here, 40 years of life.\n\nHer eyes welled, but her daughter, Ciara Hilliard, told her: \u201cCome on, Mom, don\u2019t start that.\u201d\n\nPrice, her son and two grandchildren were going to move in with Hilliard in Oxon Hill, Md., while Price\u2019s husband would stay with his sister in Capitol Heights. They were still looking for a new place. But first Price had to walk away from her old place.\n\n\u201cI really thought this building was mine,\u201d she lamented. \u201cMr. Holmes owned the building, but I ran it. I told him what was going on and when he had to make repairs. I welcomed new people to the building. I swept and mopped the floors in the stairwell \u2014 from the third floor all the way down to the laundry room. I made my husband paint the lobby. I used to put a Christmas tree by the door every year.\u201d\n\nWhen there was a fire a couple of years ago, she said, she was the one who banged on her neighbors\u2019 doors to wake them up. \u201cThey called me the mayor of the building,\u201d she recalled.\n\nHer daughter tugged at her to leave.\n\n\u201cCome on, Mom. Don\u2019t start,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI keep telling you, this is a fresh start. \u2026 You\u2019re going to have a dishwasher. And air conditioning. And maybe a yard.\u201d\n\nPrice looked one last time. Then she closed the door, locked it and handed in the keys to her home.\n\nPhotos by Marvin Joseph.
