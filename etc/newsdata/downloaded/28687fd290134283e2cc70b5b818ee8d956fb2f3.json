It allows us to add liquidity to the bond and to continue our program of diversification that has seen us widen our investor base and increase the range of debt we offer,\u201d NTMA Director of Funding Frank O\u2019Connor said in a statement.\n\nIreland received over 11 billion euros worth of orders, a similar level of demand from a year ago, with asset managers snapping up 43% of the debt, banks a further 24% and the remainder divided out between hedge funds, central banks and the pension and insurance sector, all distributed throughout Europe.\n\nHaving raised 15.4 billion euros in cash from bond sales and placements out of a 14 to 18 billion euro target for 2019, the NTMA canceled its one remaining regular bond auction scheduled for Nov. 14.\n\nAlthough green bonds make up a fraction of the overall market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and companies look to tap into increasing investor appetite as calls grow for tougher and swifter steps against climate change.\n\nLed by issuance in France and the Netherlands, a total of 8 billion euros in sovereign green bonds were issued in the second quarter, the greatest quarterly change to date, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said last month.\n\nBNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Barclays (BARC.L) Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO), J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) and Davy Stockbrokers were joint lead managers on the deal.", "description": "Ireland raised 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Thursday from the sale of green bonds at a yield well below a debut sale a year ago, highlighting the growing popularity of the bonds which provide cash for projects with environmental benefits.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
