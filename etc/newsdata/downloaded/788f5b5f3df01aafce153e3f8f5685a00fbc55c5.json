That\u2019s definitely a place that you don\u2019t want to be when you\u2019re in this league.\u201d\n\nSmith finally joined the fun, running under a deep throw from Dak Prescott on a 51-yard touchdown that sparked a second straight strong performance from the Dallas offense in last week\u2019s 31-21 win over Washington.\n\nNow Smith wants to do it again for the Cowboys (2-0), three-touchdown favorites at home against Miami (0-2) on Sunday. Not only did the long TD do wonders for his comeback, Smith\u2019s role might increase with a knee injury that could sideline leading receiver Michael Gallup for a month.\n\n\u201cEverything that I\u2019ve been doing has helped me get to this point,\u201d said Smith, who had 74 yards receiving against the Redskins after entering the game with 135 career yards and one TD from 14 games over his first two seasons in 2015-16. He hadn\u2019t played in two years.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t really want to change anything. I don\u2019t want to overhype myself or overthink anything. I just want to stay even keel and just go out here, just work hard every single day and try to have a great performance on Sunday.\u201d\n\nAfter a half-dozen or so teams passed on Smith as he looked for a job in 2018, the Cowboys signed him as soon as the season was over. He quietly went through offseason workouts - so quietly, even some of the players in the receivers room with him didn\u2019t know the whole back story.\n\n\u201cI knew he had some injuries, but I didn\u2019t know the severity of them,\u201d said Randall Cobb, who joined the Cowboys as a free agent. \u201cYou look back, it makes you think about him during OTAs and training camp. You saw his confidence continue to grow and to build.\u201d\n\nEveryone else noticed in preseason games, when Smith stood out enough to make the roster. He went without a catch in the opener, then punctuated his comeback by displaying the breakaway speed that was his most notable attribute during a 12-TD senior season at Ohio State.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d said Elliott, one of the stars who overshadowed Smith during Ohio State\u2019s title run five years ago. \u201cJust a guy who has battled the way he has in his NFL career and just to see four or five years later, things are coming together. I\u2019m happy for him.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s son, Devin Smith Jr., saw his dad\u2019s preseason TD catch in Hawaii on television, so the youngster would ask every day when Smith got home if he scored a touchdown that day. The kid finally got the answer he wanted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an inspiration,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cInjuries can hurt careers and sometimes people can never bounce back. But in this case, you found a guy that does great in offseason, training camp and preseason. He really got his confidence back and forgot about those injuries and forgot about all those things and reasons that said maybe he couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe addition of Cobb and emergence of Gallup, both behind No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper, left Smith battling for one of the final roster spots. He left little doubt he deserved it, and now has everybody wondering what could be while Gallup is out.\n\n\u201cI love playing this game,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing this game since I was five. So the fact that it\u2019s a possibility that I could be done playing the game really scared me. I just had to do everything I could to get back.\u201d\n\nNestled between his former Ohio State teammates in the Cowboys locker room, Smith can say he is back.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Devin Smith glances to his left and right in the Dallas Cowboys locker room while trying to explain how difficult it was to be out of the NFL for a year following two major knee injuries that derailed his career.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/cowboys_redskins_football_40412_c0-291-4357-2831_s1770x1032.jpg?11ae5dade39dc722eb06241954e0927e2205ca26", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
