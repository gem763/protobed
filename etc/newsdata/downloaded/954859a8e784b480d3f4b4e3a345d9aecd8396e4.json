U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were 0.3% lower at\n\n$1,509.10 per ounce.\n\n\"Gold prices are trading with weak momentum. Last week the\n\nECB (European Central Bank) already cut interest rates, now the\n\nfocus will be on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee),\" said\n\nJigar Trivedi, a commodities analyst at Mumbai-based Anand Rathi\n\nShares & Stock Brokers.\n\n\"The recent high near $1,560 in gold is a good resistance as\n\nof now. I do not think prices will go above it, lest the Fed\n\nindicates there will be another rate cut in December.\"\n\nEconomists and analysts widely expect the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve to cut its benchmark rate for a second time this year to\n\ncounter risks posed by the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe chaotic moves in money markets and late-day swings in\n\nU.S. federal funds futures mean the CME's FEDWATCH tool shows\n\nabout a 65% chance that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis\n\npoints on Wednesday.\n\nDenting safe-haven appeal for gold, Saudi Arabia sought to\n\nreassure markets after the attack on Saturday halved its crude\n\noil output, saying full production would be restored by the\n\nmonth's end.

Further consolidation is\n\nexpected over the next few weeks, especially as trade headlines\n\ncontinue to exert their influence on near-term price action,\"\n\nUBS analysts said in a note.\n\nAlso in focus is the Bank of Japan's policy meeting due on\n\nThursday. The central bank is expected to ease its policy this\n\nyear. Among other precious metals, platinum XPT= dropped 0.5% to\n\n$938.33 per ounce, while silver eased 0.6% to $17.90 an\n\nounce.
