It took us a while but we got there in the end,\u201d Vunipola said of the sessions with Reid. \u201cBeing brutally honest can hurt a few feelings (but) it was really good (Reid) gave us the platform to do it.\u201d.\n\nJones was the head coach of Japan at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and guided them to the biggest upset in the tournament\u2019s history with a victory over two-time champion South Africa. South Africa recovered to reach the semifinals.\n\nJones, who was head coach when Australia lost the 2003 Rugby World Cup final in extra-time to England, and was a consultant with South Africa when the Springboks beat England for the title in 2007, is now at the helm of English rugby.\n\n\u201cEddie has definitely got the baggage out,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cIt was something that was very important to us, and it has probably freed us up a lot in terms of our relationships.\u201d\n\nEngland opened with a 35-3 win over Tonga and a 45-7 win over the United States, and now faces two-time semifinalists Argentina on Saturday in Pool C.\n\n____\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nTonga assistant coach Dan Cron has four photographs at his home in Wellington, New Zealand - mementoes of the times teams he has coached have faced teams coached by his father, New Zealand scrum coach Mike Cron.\n\nSo far it\u2019s not a fair fight. The cumulative score is 244-47 in favor of the elder Cron.\n\nTheir first meeting was during Dan Cron\u2019s time with Tonga in the opening match of Rugby World Cup in 2011 at Eden Park in Auckland. New Zealand won 41-10. Dan was with Samoa in 2017 when they played the All Blacks in a 78-0 loss. A recent All Blacks-Tonga World Cup warm-up match ended 92-7. The fourth - when Mike was with the Panasonic Wild Knights and Dan with Suntory Sungoliath in Japan - was a lot closer.\n\n\u201cWe were 30-0 up at halftime, but then they brought on their stars and won 33-30,\u201d Dan Cron told the tournament website Tuesday. \u201cI thought I had him that day. I will get him one day.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand beat South Africa and plays its second Pool B match against Canada in Oita on Wednesday. In Pool C, Tonga has lost to England and Argentina.\n\n___\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nAfter playing the same side against Japan and Samoa in five days, has Russia made nine changes to the starting lineup facing Ireland in the Rugby World Cup on Thursday in Kobe.\n\nThe only six starters retained on Tuesday for a third straight Pool A match are prop Kirill Gotovtsev, lock Bogdan Fedotko, flanker Tagir Gadzhiev, midfielder Kirill Golosnitskiy, wing German Davydov, and fullback and captain Vasily Artemyev.\n\nFlyhalf Yuri Kushnarev, Russia\u2019s all-time record holder for caps and points, missed out on the matchday 23.\n\nRussia lost to Japan 30-10 and four days later lost to Samoa 34-9. Both times Russia faded in the second half.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 12 at the Rugby World Cup (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/japan_rugby_wcup_england_96026_c0-145-4611-2833_s1770x1032.jpg?d2f0867b08a7f6b04a5119d5e3affa981c6d7041", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
