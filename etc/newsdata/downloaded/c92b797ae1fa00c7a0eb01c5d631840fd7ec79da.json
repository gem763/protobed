Canada\u2014and specifically the Liberal Party over the past four years of its majority power\u2014has not. Trudeau, like his American counterpart in former president Barack Obama, who endorsed him last week, ultimately left a first-term legacy that provided beautiful, progressive rhetoric on the healing and drastic reversal in federal policy needed for his Indigenous constituents, but provided little by the way of concrete action.\n\nFor the past month, Indigenous writers in the Canadian media, both national and local, have bemoaned the lack of discussion on Indigenous issues in the 2019 election. In early September, Tanya Talaga, an Anishinaabe columnist for the Toronto Sun, denounced Trudeau\u2019s silence in the wake of a court\u2019s decision to demand the city of Ottawa compensate Indigenous children $2 billion for years of \u201cwillfully and recklessly\u201d underfunding their child welfare program. Three weeks later, and three days before the deadline to do so, Trudeau\u2019s government appealed the decision.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this silence and antagonistic governing from the party purportedly claiming to be on their side, Indigenous voter numbers in Canada were expected, going into Monday\u2019s election, to dip from their historic 2015 rates, barring a surprising turnout. When previously asked about why they might sit out this election, First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit voters had said that it might be more useful to return to participating solely in their own governments instead of waiting on Canada\u2019s federal system to come through for them. \u201cThere are things set in place that you can\u2019t change, that they can\u2019t change,\u201d Vivian Pratt, a would-be voter from the Constance Lake First Nation, told CBC, referring to the Canadian government. \u201cBut we can change them. We can stand up for our land and voice our opinions.\u201d (For those curious what Indigenous governance looks like, read this profile of the Haudenosaunee.)\n\nFor their part, First Nations leaders have been very open in addressing the decision by their people to abstain from the 2019 prime minister election. A large portion of the apathy stems from the aforementioned sentiment that anti-Indigenousness is a bipartisan effort. But it\u2019s also a problem of Indigenous people being disallowed from dictating the terms of engagement when it comes to campaign and election events. Not a single one of the 2019 debates featured an Indigenous panelist or moderator.", "description": "As in the United States, even progressive politicians often offer only empty promises.", "authors": ["Nick Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/82b6a35f82946b8e9581b71efb59757b4a240886.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
