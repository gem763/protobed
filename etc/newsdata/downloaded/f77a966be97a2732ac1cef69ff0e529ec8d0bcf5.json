The Trump administration has blamed the attack on Iran.\n\nThe federally owned petroleum reserve of hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil has only been tapped three times, most recently in 2011 amid unrest in Libya.\n\n___\n\n1 a.m.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is reporting that the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities mean that a return to full production may take weeks. That could mean a spike in oil prices as traders worry about supply, with potential negative consequences for the global economy.\n\nThe Journal reports that Saudi officials say a third of crude output will be restored Monday. Officials said they would use other facilities and existing stocks to supplant the gap in production.\n\nThe weekend drone attacks hit Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest oil processing facility and a major oil field, halting production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day, about half of the country\u2019s global daily output and more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily production.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, but U.S. officials say Iran is responsible. Iran denies it.\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nSenior U.S. officials are citing intelligence assessments, including satellite imagery, to support their case that Iran was responsible for Saturday\u2019s attacks on key Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure.\n\nThe officials say the intelligence shows that the strikes are inconsistent with the kind of attack that would have been launched from Yemen.\n\nThe U.S. government is releasing satellite imagery showing what officials say are at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities. The officials say the photos show impacts consistent with attack coming from the direction of Iran, rather than from Yemen.\n\nThe officials say additional devices, which apparently didn\u2019t reach their targets, have been recovered and are being analyzed by Saudi and American intelligence agencies.\n\nThe officials are speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\n\u2014Associated Press writer Zeke Miller\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nSatellite images examined by The Associated Press appear to show damage at the heart of a Saudi oil processing facility targeted in a claimed drone attack by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels.\n\nThe images Sunday come from the European Commission\u2019s Sentinel-2 satellite.\n\nThe images appear to show black char marks in the heart of Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq.\n\nThose marks were not visible in a month\u2019s worth of earlier satellite images of the facility.\n\nThe Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies in August identified the area with the char marks as the plant\u2019s stabilization area.\n\nThe center said the area\u2019s functions mean \u201cthe likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations.\u201d\n\nNeither Saudi Arabia nor the state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco have said how much damage was done to the facility.\n\n___\n\n7:55 p.m.\n\nKuwait says it is increasing security across the oil-rich small nation after an attack on oil sites in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a report Sunday night by the state-run KUNA news agency.\n\nKUNA said the order came from Prime Minister Jaber Al Mubarak Al Sabah, who asked officials to \u201ctighten security measures around vital sites inside of the country.\u201d\n\nSeparately, KUNA said authorities would investigate reports of drones flying over Kuwait. It did not elaborate.\n\nLocal Kuwaiti media has reported that witnesses say they saw a drone near a presidential palace on Saturday morning, around the same time of the attacks in Saudi Arabia.\n\n___\n\n6:00 p.m.\n\nGermany is condemning the attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and calling for de-escalation in the region.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Berlin said in a statement Sunday that \u201cthere can be no justification for such an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s civilian and critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIt noted that Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack and said it \u201cheightens tensions\u201d in the region when de-escalation is \u201curgently\u201d needed.\n\nThe statement didn\u2019t mention Iran, which the U.S. alleges was behind Saturday\u2019s attacks.\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nA leader of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels says they were able to \u201cexploit vulnerabilities\u201d in Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defense system to stage the attack previous day on the kingdom\u2019s vital oil installations.\n\nMuhammad al-Bukhaiti told The Associated Press on Sunday that the U.S. allegations that Iran was behind the attack reflected \u201cpolitical bankruptcy\u201d of the administration in Washington.\n\nThe drone attack claimed by the Houthis hit the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility and a major oil field on Saturday, sparking huge fires at a vulnerable chokepoint for global energy supplies.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the attacks and said that here\u2019s \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d\n\nPompeo said on Saturday that \u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Saad Hariri has condemned the drone attack on Saudi oil installations, describing it as an escalation that could widen conflicts in the region.\n\nHariri said in a statement on Sunday that the attack the day before in Saudi Arabia should push the international community to rein in \u201call the arms of aggression and terrorism that are striking Arab countries.\u201d\n\nHariri said Lebanon stands by Saudi Arabia, adding that the latest \u201caggression\u201d against the kingdom is part of attacks targeting Gulf Arab states and also undermines regional and international security.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister says that blaming Iran for Yemeni rebel attacks on major Saudi oil sites will not end the war in the Arab world\u2019s most impoverished country \u2014 but that talks might.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif also said in a tweet on Sunday that \u201cHaving failed at \u2018max pressure\u2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo turning to \u2018max deceit\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe also says: \u201cUS & its clients are stuck in Yemen because of illusion that weapon superiority will lead to military victory.\u201d\n\nZarif also tweeted: \u201cBlaming Iran won\u2019t end disaster.

Those militias in recent weeks have been targeted themselves by mysterious airstrikes, with at least one believed to have been carried out by Israel.\n\n___\n\n12:10 p.m.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry has dismissed the U.S. accusation that it was behind an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure the day before, calling it part of Washington\u2019s policy of \u201cmaximum lies.\u201d\n\nAbbas Mousavi made the statement on Sunday.\n\nHe says Washington adopted a \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against Iran but because of \u201cits failure, (the U.S.) is leaning toward \u2018maximum lies\u2019\u201d now.\n\nSaturday\u2019s drone attacks by Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels have halted about half of Saudi oil supplies after hitting the kingdom\u2019s biggest oil processing facility and a major oil field.\n\nThey set off huge fires and led to a suspension of \u201cproduction operations\u201d at the Abqaiq facility and the Khurais field.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the Saudi crown prince after the attack, expressing U.S. support for the kingdom\u2019s security and stability.", "description": "The president tweeted that he's authorized the release of strategic petroleum reserves \"if needed\" to stabilize energy markets after an attack on Saudi o...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ebc58240000c92b7b4d12.jpeg?cache=a4kqtnvtku&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
