Would you want it to be legal for your sexual partner to hide the fact that they\u2019re HIV positive from you? No person has the right to knowingly put others in jeopardy or endanger their health.\n\nDemocrats like Buttigieg argue, though, that due to advances in medical technology and HIV treatment, it\u2019s possible for someone to have HIV but not be contagious. This is true, in some cases, and it\u2019s a wonderful advancement. But it still doesn\u2019t justify the repeal of disclosure laws \u2014 not even close. For one, having an \u201cundetectable\u201d viral load, and therefore not being contagious, isn\u2019t a permanent status. It can fluctuate. So while yes, tests might show that an HIV-positive person is not contagious at one moment, that can always change, leaving enough risk that to warrant mandatory disclosure.\n\nI, for one, would sure as hell want to know if a sexual partner has HIV, whether they think they\u2019re contagious or not. And if they\u2019re really undetectable and therefore not dangerous, then there\u2019s little harm in having them explain that to a sexual partner.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Polumbo", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Pete-Buttigieg-Thinks-It-Should-Be-Legal-To-Knowingly-Give-Someone-Hiv"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
