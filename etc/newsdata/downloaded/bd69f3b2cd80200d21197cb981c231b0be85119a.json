He said he hoped \u201cthe first results\u201d would come by the end of that year.\n\nBut nearly 18 months later, much of the data remains unavailable to academics because Facebook says it has struggled to share the information while also protecting its users\u2019 privacy. And the information the company eventually releases is expected to be far less comprehensive than originally described.\n\nAs a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016. Seven nonprofit groups that have helped finance the research efforts, including the Knight Foundation and the Charles Koch Foundation, have even threatened to end their involvement.", "description": "The social network says it has struggled to get the information to researchers because it also wants to protect its users\u2019 privacy.", "authors": ["Davey Alba"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/business/29fbdata1/29fbdata1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
