Charles Schwab (SCHW), E*Trade (ETFC), and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) all announced that they would be offering commission-free trading. Investors are not happy about this decision and have been trading down these e-broker stocks since the announcement.\n\nInvestors and analysts are specifically pessimistic about Charles Schwab, the largest publicly traded electronic brokerage in the US. SCHW has fallen roughly 15% since its no-fee trade announcement, October 1st. The stock had been selling off all year as interest rates fall, and economic uncertainty shakes the market. This latest decision was icing on the cake of a struggling year.\n\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation Price and Consensus More\n\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation price-consensus-chart | The Charles Schwab Corporation Quote\n\nAnalysts have been dropping their EPS estimates and have pushed SCHW into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nThe Space\n\nThe retail investor space has been changing rapidly over the past 10 years, with the traditional Wall Street stockbroker becoming archaic. The days of high testosterone, fast-moving exchange floors are almost entirely over as efficient computerized systems take the main stage in high finance.\n\nElectronic brokerages were a revolutionary step in the evolution of retail investing. Early adopters like Schwab were able to capitalize on this. Investors could now buy and sell stocks on their own personal computers without a stockbroker having to mediate the transaction. This significantly cut costs for investors and made it easy for anyone, no matter the amount of capital, to play their hand in the equity markets.\n\nThe most recent change in electronic trading came with millennial\u2019s favorite free-trading app Robinhood. This application started a cultural shift in investing for the young generation. The ability to trade with no fees has brought a substantial portion of the millennials to the equity markets.\n\nMillennials are the largest consumer group and create a sizable market for electronic brokerages. With the younger generation being more interested in stocks than past generations, the longstanding e-brokerages want to take back that market. The zero-commission move was a play that these firms couldn\u2019t avoid if they wanted to remain competitive in the field.\n\nBusiness Impact\n\nCharles Schwab doesn\u2019t rely on trading commissions as much as some of the other e-brokers, but it will still impact 7% of its revenue. The move of investor capital into passive funds like ETFs and index funds is hurting the firm\u2019s asset management segment. Falling interest rates are likely negatively impacting Schwab\u2019s banking business as margins narrow.\n\nTake Away\n\nI would stay away from any electronic broker stocks until the full impact of their shift to free trading impacts the business. Robinhood can make money through selling users orders to market makers and through its premium platform. Schwab and its cohorts could offer similar premium packages to investors.\n\nWait for SCHW\u2019s earnings report on October 21st for more color on the impact of this new move.\n\nMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!\n\n\n\nIt could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.\n\n\n\nZacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.
