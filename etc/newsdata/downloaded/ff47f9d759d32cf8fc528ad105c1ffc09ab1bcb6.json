The river\u2019s trout, which attract anglers from across the state and region, depend on the surges of cool lake water because otherwise the river could get too warm for them to survive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the middle is a 94-year-old hydroelectric dam that uses the lake water to generate electricity and that bears some responsibility for keeping water users on both sides of the earthen dike happy. The Maryland Department of the Environment is currently weighing a new permit to govern how the dam owner must manage water flow over the next dozen years.\n\nThe permit, expected to be issued by the end of the year, has been the focus of a months-long debate because the lake and river waters are the lifeblood of the economy in Garrett County, a remote part of the state with few remaining industries. Wherever the water flows, it draws with it tourism dollars, whether tied to speedboats and personal watercraft, tackle and lures, or rafts and paddles.\n\nThe environmental agency\u2019s John Grace said the state will weigh the impacts on both sides of the dam before issuing a final permit. Advocates for the lake and for the river will get one more chance to share their concerns publicly at an Oct. 15 hearing at Garrett College in McHenry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really challenging situation to make everyone totally happy,\u201d said Grace, chief of the source protection and appropriations division of the state water supply program. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic, but I think it\u2019s realistic for us to be consistent and follow our mission.\u201d\n\nWet or wet-enough weather has mostly prevented conflict for the past six or seven years. But those who see the potential for a faceoff know that it could be just a dry season away.\n\nDrought has developed rapidly across parts of Maryland in recent weeks, and all of Garrett County and the surrounding area are considered \u201cabnormally dry,\u201d a precursor to drought. A relatively small 62-square-mile watershed feeds Deep Creek Lake, so its fortunes can change quickly, for better or worse, Grace said.\n\nAD\n\nFlash drought declared in D.C.\n\nAs population and development spread around the area, Neil Jacobs said, he\u2019s prepared for more conflicts. The McHenry resident and angler said he expects that there will be more need to share water resources in the future.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be some pain,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to have to take a little pain.\u201d\n\nTo residents, many of whom spend summers or weekends in the area but live elsewhere in Maryland and Pennsylvania, lake access is paramount. Development has been spreading around the lake ever since its creation, when Deep Creek was impounded to power the hydroelectric station, which began operating in 1925 and is now owned by Brookfield Renewable Power.\n\nAD\n\nConcerns about low lake levels last appeared in 2012. They prompted the Deep Creek Watershed Foundation, a nonprofit, to commission research that found significant potential effects on water access.\n\nThe lake\u2019s surface currently lies at an elevation of about 2,458.5 feet, though it\u2019s often higher in the summer. Just six inches below that level, at 2,458 feet, about 9 percent of the lake\u2019s 2,200 boat slips lose access to water, said David Myerberg, the foundation\u2019s president. At two feet lower, 2,456 feet, 15 percent are affected.\n\nAD\n\nIn some southern coves, the impact is more pronounced, with more than half of boat slips inaccessible when the lake surface lies at 2,457 feet or lower, Myerberg said.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s why property owners are concerned about proposals from trout fishery advocates and managers to increase the amount of water released for the sake of the fish.\n\nFrom the perspective of anglers and biologists, the lake water helps maintain the viability of one of Maryland\u2019s most popular stocked trout fisheries. Water released from Deep Creek Lake travels about two miles through a tunnel to the power plant beside the Youghiogheny, known by most as the Yough (it rhymes with Bach).\n\nRising temperatures and a loss of shade caused by deforestation mean that in the late summer, the Youghiogheny\u2019s waters often reach 77 degrees, the upper limit of habitability for trout. When that happens \u2014 about a dozen times a month during the summer, on average \u2014 Brookfield\u2019s permit requires it to release cool water from the bottom of the lake.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo address concerns that the river could warm to that threshold more often, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources proposed that Brookfield be required to start any necessary temperature-related releases two weeks earlier in the spring and continue them two weeks later in the fall. Officials also suggested that releases occur even if the river is flowing at levels high enough that, in the past, water temperatures rarely reached the danger zone for trout.\n\nJohn Mullican, field operations manager for the department\u2019s freshwater fisheries program, said it\u2019s important to maintain favorable conditions for fish or the state could lose valuable tourism.\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019re reduced, it takes years for that to recover, if it can recover,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nResidents, organized under the Property Owners\u2019 Association of Deep Creek Lake, have countered with requests that the temperature-related releases use less water or that Brookfield cut back on whitewater-rapid-related releases when necessary to prevent significant reductions in lake water. They have also pressed for more evidence that fish-related releases are necessary.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the argument has been made to support the need,\u201d said Paul Weiler, the group\u2019s president. \u201cDid anybody do a fish kill count?\u201d\n\nSome tweaks to Brookfield\u2019s permit have been less controversial. Whitewater rafters asked to shift some dam releases from Fridays to Saturdays in April and to squeeze in extra Saturday releases when water levels allow. A section of the river known as the Upper Yough that runs downstream of the Brookfield facility north toward the town of Friendsville is popular with kayakers and rafting companies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese few changes will have a great impact on the white-water boating and the commercial rafting industry with very little impact on lake levels,\u201d Roger Zbel, owner of Precision Rafting Expeditions in Friendsville, wrote in an email to Brookfield officials this year.\n\nAD\n\nAndy Davis, a spokesman for Brookfield, said the Canadian company is open to changes so long as its facility can keep producing the 20 megawatts of electricity it is capable of generating.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t predict the future,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf people want more releases, it\u2019s going to depend on how much water there is.\u201d\n\nMyerberg, of the watershed foundation, said that the group isn\u2019t taking a position in the debate but that any changes will have to reflect compromise.\n\n\u201cWe want to be fair to all the people who use the water,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just the people who use the water when it\u2019s in the lake.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun", "description": "Maryland is weighing a new permit that will govern the water flow of the lake over the next 12 years.", "authors": ["Scott Dance"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/l5uUpKtSGMwyv310YkFfN3Youqg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QZXTNRXDRYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
