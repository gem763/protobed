If this happens, then today\u2019s practice results will make up the grid. If that is the case, then eighth place is not a bad place to start the race.\n\n\"It\u2019s close in the middle of the grid \u2013 with half a second covering about ten cars \u2013 so it\u2019s going to be a close battle whatever happens on Sunday,\" the Mexican driver said.\n\nLance Stroll: \"There are question marks about whether qualifying will even happen \u2013 because we don\u2019t know if the storm will have cleared by Sunday morning. It certainly made things a little bit more interesting in FP2 and we had to think more about qualifying today.\n\n\"With everything cancelled tomorrow, it\u2019s quite a strange feeling. There are not a massive amount of things to do in the hotel and we won\u2019t be going outside. So I guess we will hang out and watch some movies until the weather improves\", Stroll said.\n\n\"It has been quite an unusual day. The Super Typhoon is closing in on Japan and the organisers took the sensible decision to call off track activities on Saturday. With qualifying and the race taking place on Sunday, it means we lose the final practice session\", SportPesa Racing Point F1 team principal Otmar Szanfnauer said.\n\n'We knew this just as first practice began, so we hastily adjusted our programmes to ensure we completed our qualifying preparations today. Now it\u2019s a case of wait and see what happens when the typhoon hits and how long it takes to clear us. I\u2019m hopeful that we can still have the race on Sunday, but obviously the safety of the fans and everybody involved in the sport will take priority\", the German said.", "description": "As Typhoon Hagibis bears down on the Suzuka circuit, SportPesa Racing Point F1 team put in a commendable display in the two opening practice sessions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9464/d161400ece39455a94be9d1764fcc5e7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
