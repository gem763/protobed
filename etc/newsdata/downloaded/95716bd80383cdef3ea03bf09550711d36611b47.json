I think the strategic decision that King Jong Un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further.\u201d\n\nDismissing any hopes of a deal, Bolton said that \u201cunder current circumstances, [Kim] will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.\u201d\n\nThree weeks ago, Trump announced in a tweet that he had informed Bolton that he was \u201cno longer needed at the White House,\u201d asking for his resignation letter.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure followed reports that he and the president were clashing on foreign policy matters including how to address North Korea, a country with which Trump has developed a far warmer relationship than past administrations, meeting with Kim three times for talks that have resulted in no significant progress on denuclearization. Meanwhile, the regime has continued to conduct missile tests while receiving virtually no pushback from Trump.\n\nIn his remarks, Bolton emphasized his belief \u201cthat there is only one country in the world that can stop nuclear proliferation, and we\u2019re in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if the Unites States fails in this mission, there is no other state or combination of states and no international organization that can be a substitute,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we fail, nuclear proliferation succeeds.\u201d\n\nDuring the president\u2019s speech at the United Nations General Assembly last week, he noted that the U.S. \u201chas never believed in permanent enemies\u201d and again called for denuclearization, calling North Korea \u201cfull of tremendous untapped potential.\u201d\n\nThat same week, Trump told reporters a fourth meeting with Kim \u201ccould happen soon,\u201d though he gave no timeline, according to The Associated Press.", "description": "The former national security adviser is warning that the regime will never end its nuclear program willingly.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9246bb220000c104e0438b.jpeg?cache=0q0odtue4p&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
