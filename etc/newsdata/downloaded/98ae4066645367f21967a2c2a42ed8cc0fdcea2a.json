A fitter England won a Grand Slam in his first Six Nations and were on a roll that would eventually end in a world-record equalling run of 18 consecutive Test wins against major opposition.\n\nJones, however, had told biographer Donald McRae in 2016: \"Wait until the third season, mate. We might hit a bit of a low then.\"\n\nHis words proved prophetic, with England losing five matches in a row in 2018, but Jones never wavered in the belief that England could win the World Cup in Japan.\n\nLast week's stunning semi-final win over the tournament's hot favourites, reigning champions New Zealand, was a tactical triumph for Jones.\n\nHe was responsible for the 'V' formation that saw England confront the haka in a bid to deny New Zealand a psychological edge before kick-off, as well as the often questioned selection of fullback Elliot Daly - whose run initiated the move that led to Manu Tuilagi's try in under two minutes.\n\nJones also chose as his captain Owen Farrell, once seen as a hothead but now a calming influence, and has skillfully switched between using the skipper and George Ford at fly-half in his \"horses for courses\" strategy during the knockout games.\n\nEngland defence coach John Mitchell, in charge of the All Blacks' team beaten by Jones's Wallabies in a 2003 World Cup semi-final, said there was far more to his boss than smart quips.\n\n\"He's a very good coach... He's always had a kind heart and has always been a guy that has wanted to learn and been willing to share as well.\"\n\nMeanwhile Jones paid a typical tribute to his backroom staff by saying: \"The assistant coaches have done an outstanding job.\n\n\"If you look at the percentage of work, I should probably give my money back, but I probably won't.\"\n\nIf England win the World Cup, however, Jones's employers at Twickenham will reckon he was worth every penny of his lucrative contract.", "description": "Eddie Jones' coaching career is set to come full circle when his England side face South Africa in Saturday's Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9534/210c47ac874545baa663122e0deb3ed8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
