The account will be reinstated.\n\nAnd yes, @MerrittForGA is back from the dead. Good. Twitter has blinked, but done little else: Merritt has yet to hear directly from the social-media giant explaining why the account was targeted and terminated, what was Twitter\u2019s admitted \u201cmistake,\u201d who made it, and why.\n\nMerritt has also told NR he seeks an opportunity to confront Twitter, because, minus the interest of conservative media, his account would likely still be dead. And maybe to share the rhetorical question: What happens to combat vets who lack media friends or can\u2019t gain media attention to Twitter\u2019s unjust banishments?\n\nFor him, the story is far from over.", "description": "Yes, @MerrittForGA is back from the dead.", "authors": ["Jack Fowler", "Andrew C.
