The camp here [at Leda] is very overcrowded. There are food and housing problems,\" the 50-year-old told AFP.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the UN, although Bangladeshi officials said they expected a delegation would visit the island in the next few weeks.\n\nFailed repatriation attempts\n\nBangladesh and Myanmar signed a repatriation deal two years ago, but virtually no refugees have returned to date, with UN investigators describing conditions in Myanmar as \"unsafe, unsustainable and impossible\".\n\nNearly 3,500 Rohingya in Bangladesh in August refused a United Nations-led bid to repatriate them to Myanmar over safety concerns.\n\nThe refugees were cleared for repatriation following a joint exercise led by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Bangladesh government.\n\nMyanmar refuses to recognise the Rohingya, a mainly Muslim minority who live primarily in Rakhine state, despite having lived there for generations. They have been denied citizenship and are rendered stateless.\n\nA UN report last month said Rohingya remaining in Rakhine state faced a \"serious risk of genocide\", warning that the repatriation of a million others remains \"impossible\".\n\n\n\n", "description": "Rights groups have warned the island might not be able to withstand violent storms during the annual monsoon season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/509221ef965144e9bb159ac9e93e4a93_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
