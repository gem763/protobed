Former decathlon world-record holder Ashton Eaton used to describe how even a winning performance left a nagging frustration which drew him back in for more, hoping to squeeze those extra centimetres, those milliseconds which would drip out a few more points. This is the thing about heptathlon; you can never really complete it. The world record still stands at a ridiculous 7,291 points, set by Jackie Joyner-Kersee at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. And so perhaps it helps to have the mentality of the reigning world and Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, who doesn\u2019t really see impossible as a barrier, so much as a target.\n\n\u201cI think the interesting thing about the heptathlon is that you have so many things to handle at the same time,\u201d says Thiam, sitting in an old rickety stand overlooking her training track in Liege. \u201cYou try to do a perfect heptathlon. The goal is to do a heptathlon where you do personal bests everywhere and it\u2019s almost impossible. If I could do in all my PBs in one heptathlon that would be incredible, and it would be a very high score, I think. Even just six PBs that would be really high, but like I say, it\u2019s almost impossible. But I hope I can do that one day, that\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\nIf multi-discipline sport is the purest test of athletic ability then there\u2019s an argument to say Thiam is the best female athlete on the planet. Aged 25, she already has the third highest heptathlon score in history as one of only four women to have broken the 7,000 points barrier. She could compete in most of the seven events individually but her jumping is exceptional, with a high jump PB of 2.02m only 7cm short of the 30-year-old world record. In a few days\u2019 time in Doha she could add \u2018world champion 2019\u2019 to her extensive list of titles, and as if to drive home the point, last week she completed an undergraduate degree in geography. She\u2019s weighing up a masters in territorial planning, of course, but that can wait for now.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really long six years so I\u2019m happy I finished it.\u201d When Thiam began her degree at the University of Liege, there were plenty of critics on hand to warn her that studying would detract from her athletic achievements. Was she pleased to prove them wrong? \u201cYeah, I think so. Not that I was trying to, I didn\u2019t care, but I think I showed it\u2019s possible to get to a very high level and that also to do something on the side can also be beneficial, because I think it\u2019s really healthy along with athletics to have study on the side.\u201d\n\nBy most standards this year should have been a struggle: alongside her studies she battled a slew of injuries, yet still set personal bests in the long jump, high jump, 200m and shot put, to even her own astonishment. \u201cIt was a very weird year because I had a few problems physically, but whenever I went back to competition it was always really really great for my personal PBs. I was a bit surprised about that but I try not to really think about it or try to find a reason. I\u2019m just feeling good so I just go with it.\u201d\n\nThe terrifying part for rivals like Britain\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson is that Thiam might yet get better. She already has the optimum physical attributes for an all-round athlete, standing tall at 6ft 2ins with springs in her legs and a deceptively powerful upper body, and leaving her degree behind has given her the gift of time to hone her craft.\n\n\u201cI would get up early to start with training or school, 8am-8pm, so pretty long, and tiring,\u201d she says with a grin and a look that says she doesn\u2019t miss the morning alarm clock. \u201cNow I have way more my time for myself because I\u2019ve been really tired all these years, it was a hard rhythm to keep up with. More time to rest, more time to go to the physio, to do exercise on the side, to pay attention to what I\u2019m eating. Because when you don\u2019t have time you have more temptation to go an order something rather than cook something healthy yourself, so I think it\u2019s going to change a lot. Probably also more time to go to training camp, because with the studies I couldn\u2019t really leave Belgium more than twice a year, so now I can whenever I want.\u201d\n\nShe is free to leave Belgium altogether, of course. On arrival this seems an inauspicious place to find an Olympic champion: the autumn sun is shining on the old municipal track which in an hour or so will be filled with kids practising and hoping to emulate Thiam, whose face hangs on a poster on by the car park. This part of Belgium, or any part come to think of it, is not exactly a hotbed of athletics legacy; Thiam could easily move to California or Monaco where the sun shines a little brighter and where so many of the world\u2019s best athletes live and train. She still works with the same coach, Roger Lespagnard, a 73-year-old Belgian former decathlete and kindly man who interrupts our interview to introduce himself. She loves to travel and cook, and is clearly someone with a broad perspective on life; isn\u2019t she tempted to leave Liege and try something new?\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do more of the two-weeks, three-week training camps through the year, but I think my training base will still be here. I don\u2019t want to change that. I started with my coach when I was 14 and I\u2019m 25 now. It\u2019s really fitting with me so I don\u2019t see any reason to leave to be honest. If one day I see not enough progress or we don\u2019t agree on some stuff, of course I would consider it, but it\u2019s working good.\u201d\n\nIt would mean leaving behind her mother, too, who brought her up in Belgium after her father returned to his home country, Senegal. Thiam rarely talks about her personal life, nor should she; she has said before that she is naturally shy, a trait which has hardened over time into a quiet resilience. \u201cI think I had to get used to a lot of things that I wasn\u2019t used to, situations I wasn\u2019t comfortable with. Press conferences, having to talk in front of a lot of people. I think it\u2019s OK now but I\u2019m still the same me so I\u2019m still a shy person I think, I\u2019m a discreet person. Maybe I\u2019m more protecting of myself [now], because Belgium is a small country and I got in the light all of a sudden and everybody wants to know everything about you. There\u2019s some stuff I\u2019m happy to share with people but there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s only for me, like sentimental life. So I will protect myself.\u201d\n\nShe has learned not only how to cope with the spotlight but how to embrace it too; earlier this year she walked the catwalk at the Paris Fashion Show alongside other athletes wearing a luminous yellow dress and running trainers. \u201cThat was so cool!\u201d she says. \u201cI was a little bit stressed I\u2019d fall and ruin the show.\u201d\n\nUltimately it is Thiam\u2019s talent and work ethic which threw her into the limelight, beating Jessica Ennis-Hill to Olympic gold in Rio aged only 22, while nursing a damaged elbow. She exudes a seemingly unshakable motivation to find self-improvement that makes you want to bottle it up and take it home, and perhaps it has actually helped that she is introverted at heart; athletics is by and large and isolated activity, with only your body\u2019s aches and your mind\u2019s doubts for company, a spiritual journey in which most of the gratification is found in the dedication.\n\n\u201cI think everybody has bad days, but [for me] not so many actually, I just love sport. It\u2019s a job of course, it\u2019s a lot of sacrifice, but I feel lucky it\u2019s my life. I never thought I would be able to make it a job. I\u2019m just very lucky that my passion is actually paying the bills. It\u2019s hard, but I get a lot of satisfaction when I finish a training that\u2019s hard and I gave my all.\u201d\n\nWhere does she push herself to next? The world record may still be \u201cuntouchable\u201d, she says \u2013 \u201cI hope one day I\u2019m close enough to say \u2018OK that\u2019s my goal, I want to beat it\u2019 but I\u2019m really, really, really, reeeally far from it\u201d \u2013 but then Thiam doesn\u2019t really do impossible. After these World Championships her attention will switch to Tokyo 2020 Games where she will arrive not under the radar like Rio but most likely as the overwhelming favourite to win gold. Yet you suspect that in these intervening years she has learned more than enough to cope with the expectation.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve learned a lot through the years on the mental side,\u201d she says. \u201cRio a lot, definitely, it changed my head. I feel like it\u2019s a bit cliche, but nothing can really stop me. I can get injured but I don\u2019t lose my motivation, I\u2019m always going 100 per cent, I just try to find another way. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing this year and it paid off. Now I feel in really great shape, I just want to have fun and I feel like I can do a big score.\u201d", "description": "There is something addictive about multi-discipline events like heptathlon.
