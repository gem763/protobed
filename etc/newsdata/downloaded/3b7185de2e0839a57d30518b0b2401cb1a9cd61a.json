Walking down familiar territory \u2015 42 Street right past the hulking mass that is the Port Authority building \u2015 tourists are jumbled up with office workers and young hipsters, who all avoid the homeless lying here and there on the sidewalk.\n\nThe city is all about the hustle, and there aren\u2019t many places where that is more evident than in Times Square. If you walk just a little bit farther, you\u2019ll reach a place that is a brick-and-mortar representation of that ambitious spirit, one of a multitude of other stores selling the same thing: pizza slices for a dollar.\n\nWedged in between a tiny caf\u00e9 selling Vietnamese baos and the remnants of a seedy flophouse hotel, this pizza parlor is part of the rise of the dollar pizza slice in New York City, a rise that illustrates a wave of resilience in the face of gentrification and high rents.\n\nRichard Levine via Getty Images Pizza lovers line up at a 2 Bros. Pizza store in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThose who hail from New York City have maintained for years that a slice should cost you roughly about the same as a ride on the subway. It\u2019s known as the Pizza Principle, which was laid out in a report by an independent blogger in 2014.\n\nBut when the housing market bubble burst in 2008, spurring a major recession, people\u2019s pockets got tighter. Out of that period of chaos, the dollar slice as we know it today was born. Midtown Manhattan became dotted with these bargain pizza parlors. There are 61 within the five boroughs today with a mobile app serving as a directory.\n\nFor many who partake in these dollar slices, the main appeal is the price combined with the taste. As streetwear entrepreneur Jovan Stroop sees it, \u201cI feel like it has become a New York staple in some ways,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cNew York is already known for excellent pizza, and $1 pizza gives people another option.\u201d The fact that these places are open 24 hours also helps night owls who need to satiate their hunger after a work shift or after a hard night of partying.\n\nThis is best summed up by Katherine Cahill of Boston, who said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re out late without much money and you see a place selling dollar slices, who wouldn\u2019t go \u2018Hell yeah\u2019 for that?\u201d\n\nThe most surprising thing is that 11 years after the first parlor opened, there are still so many in operation. This despite commercial rent prices dropping 4.5% since last year, to $776 on average per square foot, the costs are still high enough to see flagship retailers like Barneys New York close their doors. Dollar pizza slice parlors have been able to weather the storm of closures by keeping customers lined up for more (with 2 Bros. Pizza and 99 Cent Fresh being the two leading franchises among the crowd).\n\nRichard Levine via Getty Images\n\nA visit to the 2 Bros. Pizza over on 38th Street at 8th Avenue showed a huge line out of the back for dollar slices (slices with toppings were $2 and up and were served at the front). Location matters, too. Many are found near major subway junctions, like Times Square, and in areas with a lot of foot traffic, like the Lower East Side.\n\nMany dollar slice joints are also doing combo deals, where two slices and a bottle of water will run you $2.75, competing with many fast-food chains. The use of electric ovens in these pizzerias instead of traditional ones can turn out upwards of 400 pies a day.\n\nAs executive chef Russ Barrett said, \u201cThe technology today, when it comes to ovens, allows them to churn and burn but be more efficient.\u201d\n\nIngredients matter, too. Many opt for cheaper ones from places like Restaurant Depot, which are called \u201cafter-market.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne example is, these places use all-purpose flour, which is [cheaper than] the double-0 flour that\u2019s milled in Italy and is the standard\u201d for pizza dough, Barrett told HuffPost. \u201cYou can tell the difference when it comes to the crust. It\u2019s impossible to not make money off of pizza if your margins are lower.\u201d\n\nThe biggest takeaway when it comes to dollar slices comes from seeing guys from places like Bangladesh and El Salvador behind the counter. Some were reluctant to talk about their experience. As one who declined to give his name at a 99 Cent Fresh Pizza said, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the business. I\u2019m just happy to work here.\u201d", "description": "Built as a response to a recession in 2008, these pizza shops could soon come in handy again.", "authors": ["Christopher Smith", "On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7026e1240000fd0c74a759.jpeg?cache=yKZLvvEe3t&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
