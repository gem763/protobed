It could be 80 years, it could be 50 years, it could be 20 years, and we\u2019re going to be on the front line.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018As a doctor, I\u2019m proud to be part of Extinction Rebellion. This is a public health intervention.\n\n\u2018Many of my colleagues have been here, many have been arrested.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve tried other means, telling the government what we think they should do \u2013 and they haven\u2019t done it.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
