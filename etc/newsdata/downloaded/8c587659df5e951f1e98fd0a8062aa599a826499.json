Season on HBO Max", "language": "en", "text": "Who\u2019s calling Alia Shawkat? HBO Max, that\u2019s who! Photo: TBS\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 months since TBS announced it was ordering a third season of its critically beloved cult hit comedy Search Party, and since then, there\u2019s been not a hint about when the new season would be hitting screens. The mystery surrounding the show\u2019s fate is now over: Search Party is jumping to HBO Max, the streaming platform from TBS parent company WarnerMedia that\u2019s set to launch next spring. And in even better news, the streamer has green-lit \u2014 and already filmed! \u2014 a fourth season of the Alia Shawkat\u2013led series. It was only a matter of time before all that streaming money went to fund the latest in post-hipster New York character fashions.\n\nSeason three of Search Party will premiere at the same time HBO Max debuts in spring 2020, with season four dropping at some point beyond that. HBO Max has not yet announced if it plans to debut shows on a binge-friendly all-at-once model, weekly, or some combination thereof, so it\u2019s not yet clear how Search Party will roll out. HBO Max will be an ad-free service, so a binge release could very much be a possibility. (Seasons one and two will be available in full when HBO Max premieres, so you\u2019ll definitely be able to binge those episodes.)\n\nIf you need a reminder on where things stand with Search Party (and if you haven\u2019t watched the second season, stop reading here), the last season ended with Dory snapping and pushing her neighbor April off the side of the Staten Island Ferry (after April tried tried to blackmail her for $100,000), and then getting arrested for the murder of Keith Powell thanks to an \u201canonymous tip.\u201d\n\nAccording to series creator and showrunner Charles Rogers, the third season will switch gears from season two\u2019s Hitchcockian paranoia to a legal thriller. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of that media frenzy, To Die For\u2013type of genre,\u201d Rogers told Vulture in an exclusive interview. Even though Rogers says the season will find Dory \u201cdescending into the darkest recesses of her shadow side,\u201d the show\u2019s sense of humor will remain. \u201cAs the season goes on, things ratchet up up and get very circusy, in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of courtroom chaos and compounding variables that make it all so much harder to deal with,\u201d he said. The characters, like most people caught in true-crime stories, also get very famous, which fulfills some of their own dreams: Rogers promised an exchange where Meredith Hagner\u2019s Portia asks, \u201cDo you think we\u2019re the most famous people in the world right now?\u201d and John Early\u2019s Elliott answers, \u201cI hope so.\u201d\n\nRogers and fellow creator and showrunner Sarah-Violet Bliss are keeping the shape of the show\u2019s fourth season more secret, but they said it grew out of an idea they hatched in the writers\u2019 room on the first day of writing the third. That fourth season will operate in yet another genre, according to Rogers, and it\u2019ll have more \u201creflective\u201d ideas that bring the show more \u201cfull circle\u201d \u2014 though they\u2019re still leaving open the possibility of continuing on from there. That season is also the first written specifically for a streaming service, which as Bliss points out, means they don\u2019t have to write episodes around commercial breaks anymore. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow up with you on how that feels to us,\u201d she joked. And while HBO Max isn\u2019t yet confirming how the show\u2019s episodes will be released, the Search Party team seems very much onboard with the idea of all eps dropping at once. \u201cIt feels like HBO Max is going to have a very binge-y feeling to it because it\u2019s going to be such a big streaming platform, and that\u2019s always felt like the way the show should be,\u201d said Rogers.\n\nWhile having Search Party as part of its launch roster will give HBO Max a title with an preexisting fan base \u2014 always a good thing for a subscription-based service \u2014 the decision by WarnerMedia execs to shift the show to streaming was less about bolstering Max and more about finding a better home for Search Party. Despite great buzz and reviews, the series generated decidedly so-so linear ratings during its two seasons on TBS, and even with delayed viewing, still wasn\u2019t anything close to a hit. In an April 2018 press release announcing renewals of both Search Party and the Tracy Morgan comedy The Last O.G., TBS hyped the latter\u2019s Nielsen and multi-platform numbers, bragging it had reached \u201cnearly 25 million viewers across TBS\u2019 linear, digital, mobile and on-demand platforms\u201d and that it ranked as \u201cthe largest cable comedy premiere since 2015.\u201d The same release, while noting double-digit audience growth between season one and two, talked up how Search Party was the network\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 series on digital, and became the fastest TBS original to reach one million views on [video on demand] in season one,\u201d adding the show had \u201can on-demand audience as much as 17 years younger than linear.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Search Party is a much better fit for a subscription-based VOD platform trying to reach cord-cutters and millennials. Moving the show to Max allows WarnerMedia to keep a title with great buzz and a devoted audience without having to worry about selling ad time on a show with such a small audience. \u201cWith HBO Max we have the unique opportunity to continue this brilliant, acclaimed series and connect with even more of the younger, digital natives who have worshipped it the most,\u201d Kevin Reilly, chief content officer for HBO Max (and president of TBS, TNT and truTV), said in a press release announcing the move.\n\nAnother reason it makes sense for Search Party to leave its original home? TBS is evolving from a comedy-focused network to a more general-interest cable channel, meaning Search Party no longer fits the edgy/quirky comedy brand the network had explored in recent years with shows such as Angie Tribeca, Wrecked, and The Detour, all of which have now ended. TBS is still doing comedies, including The O.G., but it has also begun ordering some drama projects as well.", "description": "The cult hit Search Party is jumping from TBS to HBO Max, the  WarnerMedia streaming platform that\u2019s set to launch next spring.
