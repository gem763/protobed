Nothing surprises me anymore,\" he proclaimed, adding \"but it\u2019s nice to have the support of the president of the United States.\"\n\nSEAN SPICER DEBUTS ON 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' SHIMMYING TO SPICE GIRLS SONG IN NEON-GREEN RUFFLED SHIRT\n\nLast month, POTUS tweeted out his thoughts on Spicer being cast as a contestant: \"Just heard that Sean Spicer will be on 'Dancing with the Stars.' He will do great. A terrific person who loves our Country dearly!\"\n\nSpicer said he was at dinner when he found out about Trump's tweet.\n\n\"I take a call just thinking [that] I normally don't answer numbers that I don't recognize. And [the man on the other line] said, \u2018Hey, are you going to answer the tweet from the President?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Look, you got to call the White House.\u2019 \u2018No, it\u2019s about you.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Would you like me to read it?\u2019 because I was at a place where you put your phone down when you're having dinner. And so he read it off, the reporter and I said, \u2018OK, I guess it's nice to have the support of the president.\u2019\u201d\n\nSPICER HITS BACK AT CRITICS PROTESTING HIS CASTING ON 'DANCING WITH THE STARS'\n\nSpicer revealed that he wrote Trump back directly and said: \u201cThank you Mr. President. I\u2019m in it to win it!\u201d\n\nSpicer, 47, told us that the reason he decided to do the show was to bring some levity to the current state of affairs.\n\n\"Look, we can sit around tonight from a totally diverse set of backgrounds and root for each other. We can have fun together and actually be excited when another person does really well. We're missing that right now. And this is a great show to bring families and individuals together, even if it's just two hours a week.\"\n\n'DANCING WITH THE STARS' HOST TOM BERGERON SLAMS POLITICALLY 'DIVISIVE BOOKINGS' AFTER SEAN SPICER IS CAST\n\nWhen asked how his performance went, the extremely novice dancer admitted that he was pleased.\n\n\"If you saw that opening package and you realize where I started and where I ended up tonight, the judges may have some problems, but I think it's a miracle what she has been able to transform me into in just three weeks,\u201d he said, of working with his professional dancing partner, Lindsay Arnold.\n\nAnd regarding the lime green outfit, the song \u2013 \u201cSpice up Your Life,\u201d and the fact that judge Carrie Ann Inaba told him that she was granting him \u201cthe best fluorescent shimmy of the night,\u201d Spicer says it was all in good fun.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWell, it definitely wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d he explained. And he hopes that America will appreciate his playful side, even if it\u2019s a bit at his own expense. \u201cIf they want to see a silly guy wearing a line green shirt, then sure. But I'm having fun and if that's the side they see, great,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while Spicer didn\u2019t receive rave reviews from the judging panel, he isn\u2019t letting that stop him. \u201cIf you didn't think I was all in, you know it tonight!\u201d he exclaimed. And he could care less if you like him or hate him. \u201cI'm going to be who I am. If you like what you saw, great. If not, then don't vote for me.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the leader of the free world will tune in on Monday nights, Spicer replied, \u201cHonest to God, I have no idea. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me\" before playfully adding, \u201cI just want his vote. Whether you watch or not, as long as you vote!\u201d", "description": "Some viewers may be divided over \"Dancing with the Stars\" contestant Sean Spicer, but the former White House press secretary has one supporter: President Trump.", "authors": ["Nicole Pajer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/sean-spicer-abc-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
