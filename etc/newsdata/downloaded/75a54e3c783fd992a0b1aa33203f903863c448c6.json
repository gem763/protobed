It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the two sides had struck a \u201cgreat new deal\u201d and urged U.K. lawmakers to ratify it in a special session on Saturday.\n\nImmediately complicating matters was Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish government allies which didn\u2019t waste a minute to say they could not back the outline deal because of provisions for the Irish border.\n\nJohnson needs all the support he can get to push any deal past a deeply divided Parliament and will surely temper jubilation at the EU summit. The UK parliament already rejected a previous deal three times.\n\nTechnical negotiators struggled longest to finetune customs and sales tax regulations that will have to manage trade in goods between the Northern Ireland and Ireland \u2014 where the U.K. and the EU share their only land border.\n\nAfter months of gloom over the stalled Brexit process, European leaders have sounded upbeat this week. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that \u201cI want to believe that a deal is being finalized,\u201d while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were \u201cin the final stretch.\u201d\n\nThey were proven right on Thursday.\n\nUpon the news, the pound hit a five-month high upon the U.S. dollar.\n\nJohnson \u2014 who took office in July vowing Britain would finally leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may \u2014 likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest.\n\nHe will have to climb some more to get the Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party on board. DUP leader Arlene Foster and the party\u2019s parliamentary chief Nigel Dodds said they \u201ccould not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues,\u201d referring to a say the Northern Irish authorities might have in future developments.\n\nThe party said the position was unchanged after the announcement of the provisional deal.\n\nBoth the customs and consent arrangements are key to guaranteeing an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland \u2014 the main obstacle to a Brexit deal.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story corrected a typographical error in the DUP leader\u2019s name to Arlene, not Arlen.", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 Britain and the European Union said Thursday that they have struck an outline Brexit deal after days of intense see-saw negotiations \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/609f21_britain-nato-87477-british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-walks-out-greet-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
