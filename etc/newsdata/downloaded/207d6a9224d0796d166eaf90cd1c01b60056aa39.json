Debunked: Moon landing conspiracy theories 1/8 Flag waves but there is no wind on the moon The theory goes that as the flag is waving in the wind, it must have been on earth as there is no wind on the moon. If it were on the moon it would simply droop. The truth is that it is not waving, rather it is being held in place by a telescopic pole running through the top of the flag and it is crumpled as it had been screwed up for days en route to the moon Nasa 2/8 Boot doesn't match the boot print It is suggested that this picture of a boot print on the moon is fake because it does not line up with the tread of this boot from Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit. That\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t NASA 3/8 Boot doesn\u2019t match the boot print The print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we\u2019re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong. NASA 4/8 No stars in outer space? Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun. NASA 5/8 Astronauts couldn\u2019t survive the radiation belts The Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth\u2019s magnetic field. The conspiracy theory goes that the astronauts could not possibly survive exposure to this level of radiation. NASA 6/8 Astronauts couldn\u2019t survive the radiation belts Professor Anu Ojha of the National Space Centre answers: \u2018Firewalking. If you\u2019ve ever done firewalking, you\u2019ll know the one thing you don\u2019t do is linger around in the middle of the firepit. You cross as quickly as you can... as long as you walk across quite quickly, looking at the thermal conductivity of your feet, you are not going to have enough thermal energy going into the soles of your feet to burn you. You\u2019re absolutely fine. Just don\u2019t hang around in the middle! In a similar way, the transit time through the Van Allen radiation belt right at the beginning of the Apollo voyages was incredibly short. Travelling through the Van Allen radiation belt if you are going fast enough \u2013 which you need to be if you\u2019re going to the Moon \u2013 is no problem whatsoever.\u2019 AFP/Getty 7/8 Shadows aren\u2019t parallel - must be a lighting set-up These two shadows are pointing in separate directions, hence they must be lit by two separate lights in a studio set-up rather than the single-point source of the sun. NASA 8/8 Shadows aren\u2019t parallel - must be a lighting set-up No, this is simply a matter of perspective. The moon\u2019s surface is not flat and so the shadows are not projected perfectly parallel. This question would have never been asked if we could see the beginning of the shadows, which would all align with the same vanishing point.
