We have quarters that are 5-10 per cent growth, and then others that are 40-50 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"If the market sees 5-10 per cent and then 50 per cent, it'll be hard for investors to have a sense of the expectation of the business and for management to have to answer those questions when they have meaty things they need to be doing to drive growth.\"\n\nLaunched in late 2012, Rokt has grown from a small office of eight people in Sydney to a global workforce of 220. Its Sydney office is still home to the majority of its people, but New York now has a staff of 80 and the company has eight global offices.\n\nRokt's software is designed to help businesses monetise under-used portions of their websites. It lets them present consumers with personalised complementary products and offers after they complete a transaction \u2013 a time when Rokt believes they are most receptive to marketing.\n\nThe benchmark to become a unicorn (a $US1 billion company, as valued by venture capitalists) is usually to achieve about $US100 million in revenue, which Rokt is positioned to do by the end of 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week the company made its third acquisition, buying business-to-business marketing technology company OfferLogic for an undisclosed sum.\n\nOfferLogic, which adds 10-15 per cent to the size of Rokt according to Mr Buchanan, has created similar technology to it but focuses on the business market, not consumer-facing businesses.\n\nExpanded marketplace\n\nIt was immediately merged under the Rokt brand and added clients such as Staples, GoDaddy, Yelp, Google and VistaPrint to Rokt's stable of customers.\n\nMr Buchanan said the addition of a B2B vertical had expanded its marketplace twentyfold.\n\n\"Twelve months ago, I came across OfferLogic and they were solving the same problem but in a different vertical. It was a match made in heaven,\" he said.\n\n\"Our technology can fuel a three-fold increase in their performance straight away because we're so much further along. They would have to spend 10 years building what we've done in five.\"\n\nMr Buchanan said he had spent two years \"dating\" OfferLogic CEO Bryan Seastead, getting him comfortable that the firms would fit well together, before making an offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Often acquisitions fail because most are done on a business case that is optimistic and relies on cost synergies. My belief is that if there isn't a strong revenue synergy, you're in a tough spot to make it work in the long run.\"\n\nMr Buchanan said there were a handful of other acquisition opportunities on Rokt's radar that would add to its client base.\n\nThe company intends to spend $US40 million on research and development in 2020, with $US38 million of that to be spent in Australia.\n\nIt is investing in building up the artificial intelligence capabilities of its platform, as well as adding more languages, currencies and data analytics. It has also expanded into the financial services sector, personalising payment options for customers and surfacing offers for new credit card deals at the checkout.", "description": "Bruce Buchanan's marketing tech company Rokt is making headway in the huge US market, and revenue is up 100 per cent this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2188%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_471%2C$y_117/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c9ba1466f3cd9ffe987d42063ac4447debd88777", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
