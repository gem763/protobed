Archie Bradley retired the final four batters for his 15th save.\n\nLeake allowed four earned runs in 26 innings over previous four starts, but the Marlins hit him hard early.\n\nMarlin hit his 20th homer in the second inning and Harold Ramirez followed with a run-scoring single. Dean hit a solo homer in the fourth.\n\nLeake gave up three runs on eight hits and struck out four.\n\nAlcantara allowed one run over seven innings his last start, against San Francisco. He wasn\u2019t nearly as effective against the Diamondbacks, who scored four runs off the right-hander in the first three innings.\n\nAlcantara left a 1-2 pitch up and over the plate in the first inning to Almonte, who sent it into the pool deck in right-center.\n\nLeyba hit run-scoring triple and scored on Jerrod Dyson\u2019s single in the second inning, then drove in another run in the fourth on a groundout. Walker\u2019s 26th homer put Arizona up 5-3 in the sixth.\n\nAlcantara allowed five runs - four earned - on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: C Jorge Alfaro was back in the lineup after being hit on his non-throwing hand by a bat and leaving Tuesday\u2019s game in the second inning.\n\nDiamondbacks: CF Ketel Marte was out of the lineup and had a precautionary MRI after leaving Tuesday\u2019s game in the fifth inning with back stiffness. \u2026 SS Nick Ahmed was out for the second straight due to an injured finger on his throwing hand suffered in Monday\u2019s game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: RHP Robert Duggar has allowed two runs or less in five straight starts heading into Friday\u2019s game at home against Washington.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Merrill Kelly is 2-1 with a 1.35 ERA in three starts heading into Friday\u2019s game at San Diego.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Leake worked effectively through traffic into the seventh inning, Domingo Leyba had two RBIs and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Miami Marlins 5-4 on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/marlins_diamondbacks_baseball_90890_c0-135-3230-2018_s1770x1032.jpg?d79d3613d4110c5ce2e0fecabe3f1569544f8ba7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
