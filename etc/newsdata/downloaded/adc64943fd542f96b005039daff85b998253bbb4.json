Over the past fortnight he has tabled reforms, including the abolishment of several cabinet positions, and some cuts to spending, but the moves have fallen short of the structural changes demanded by protesters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Saad Hariri.

The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah \u2013 the most powerful figure in Lebanon despite not holding an official position \u2013 has warned of widespread chaos if protests were allowed to continue.\n\nHariri\u2019s supporters spent much of Tuesday trying to talk him out of quitting, fearing even deeper instability in Lebanon, where political uncertainty and extreme levels of government debt have caused widespread alarm in recent months and spilled over into mass demonstrations, the scale of which had not been seen for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cI know for sure that the main target is the top of the system,\u201d said Ali Dirani, a 33-year-old protester. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a domino effect; what I expect is that Hariri is expendable for the confessional regime that we\u2019re trying to topple. What people should focus on now is that we need to find an alternative. Our problem is not with Hariri personally, or even his government. We have a problem that is rooted in the system of decision-making and the relationship between citizen and state.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, Patricia Zogheib, 45, said: \u201cWe should celebrate the first step of success. Not complete success yet. But it must be acknowledged. May we wake up tomorrow with more realistic plans to go forward.\u201d\n\nCamille Abusleiman, who was labour minister until he resigned earlier this month, said: \u201cWe had proposed that the PM resign alongside the ministers representing the [political bloc] Lebanese Forces. Although late, we welcome his resignation and hope he will go through with it, as the people of Lebanon have clearly lost confidence in this government.\u201d\n\nRose, 26, was protesting in central Beirut when she heard that Hariri had gone. \u201cWe just want to say that this is the first out of many,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the others to show some dignity. But I doubt they have it.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Nadia al-Faour", "description": "Hariri says he intends to make \u2018positive shock\u2019 to country gripped by mass protests", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d768020dad2503b19f5b0edccb1c401c8141ae/0_33_2703_1621/master/2703.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4925f1bac11bde4f3d563d9cd43e8e25", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
