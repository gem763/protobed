You have abused your positions and the access you had in a quite appalling way, in watching autopsies and in taking the photographs and screenshots you did.\u201d\n\nCrabtree said both defendants used the CCTV system to replay the footage of the footballer\u2019s postmortem examination and took screenshots.\n\nBray sent a screenshot to a relative while Ashford let a friend photograph the screenshot he had taken. The images appeared on Twitter and on other sites.\n\nThe footballer\u2019s sister, Romina Sala, said in a victim impact statement that her family was devastated by the pair\u2019s actions. She said: \u201cI have seen photos of Emiliano\u2019s body leaked on Instagram, and I cannot believe there are people so wicked and evil who could do that.\n\n\u201cI was sad as people were making jokes about it. I\u2019ll never erase the images from my head. My brother and mother can never forget about this. It\u2019s hard for me to live with this image.\u201d\n\nSala, 28, had just signed for Cardiff City when the plane he was travelling in crashed into the sea, north of Guernsey, on 21 January. His body was recovered and a postmortem took place at Bournemouth borough mortuary.\n\nSwindon crown court heard that Bray, a director of Camera Security Services (CCS), watched live footage of the postmortem on the afternoon of 7 February \u2013 outside the hours that the company is contracted to monitor the cameras.\n\nBray\u2019s and Ashford\u2019s actions came to light on 14 February when a member of the public flagged up the image to the police.\n\nPolice investigated and found a text message exchange between Bray and Ashford while the postmortem was taking place.\n\nThe first message, from Bray, read: \u201cNice one on table for you to watch when you are next in\u201d, followed by an emoji of a face being sick. Ashford replied: \u201cNot from the plane that crashed into the sea?\u201d\n\nEmiliano Sala plane fell thousands of feet in seconds \u2013 investigators Read more\n\nAfter Bray realised the image was distributed online she told Ashford: \u201cDelete your pics\u201d and the pair discussed deleting CSS\u2019s live feed of the autopsy room cameras.\n\nWhen she was interviewed by the police, Bray admitted watching live footage of Sala\u2019s postmortem on 7 February and re-accessing next day. But she also said: \u201cI don\u2019t sit there watching mortuary footage all day, I\u2019m not sick. Although I am sick, because I\u2019ve just done that.\u201d\n\nAshford, who worked as a night-shift camera operative at CSS for 13 years, admitted he had watched mortuary footage in the past, and had a \u201cmorbid obsession\u201d with forensics.\n\nThe court was told that Bray had allowed a \u201cculture\u201d to become embedded at CSS whereby she and other staff would watch postmortems.\n\nForensic pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said he was not aware the security cameras in the mortuary were able to film postmortem examinations and that if he had he known, he would not have allowed it to take place, adding it was a \u201cflagrant breach of medical confidentiality\u201d.\n\nBray, of Corsham, Wiltshire, and Ashford, of Calne, Wiltshire, admitted three counts of computer misuse. Bray also admitted perverting the course of justice by trying to cover up what had happened.\n\nAnthony Johns, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \u201cSherry Bray and Christopher Ashford caused immense suffering to Mr Sala\u2019s family and friends with their deeply offensive actions. It is impossible to imagine why anyone would wish to record or view these sorts of images in such a flagrant breach of confidentiality and human decency.\u201d", "description": "Sherry Bray and Christopher Ashford receive 14 months and five months in jail respectively", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/429234f6ab5abdeb8084879f608544c612d2c3ed/0_72_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=62a7b67bfc72fd4a7c0746964aaab547", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
