(Oct. 11) AP Domestic\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 California will be the first state to ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products and the third to bar most animals from circus performances under a pair of bills signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe fur law bars residents from selling or making clothing, shoes or handbags with fur starting in 2023.\n\nAnimal rights groups cheered the measure as a stand against inhumane practices. The proposal was vigorously opposed by the billion-dollar U.S. fur industry, and the Fur Information Council of America has already threatened to sue.\n\nIt follows Newsom\u2019s signing of legislation that makes California the first state to outlaw fur trapping and follows bans on sales of fur in Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a leader when it comes to animal welfare, and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cBut we are doing more than that. We are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames.\u201d\n\nIn this Sept. 18, 2018 file photo protesters with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) hold signs to ban fur in Los Angeles prior to a news conference at Los Angeles City.

And it excludes the sale of leather, dog and cat fur, cowhides, deer, sheep and goat skin and anything preserved through taxidermy.\n\nIt could mark a significant blow to the fur industry that makes products from animals including mink, chinchillas, rabbits and other animals. The U.S. retail fur industry brought in $1.5 billion in sales in 2014, the most recent data available from the Fur Information Council.\n\nFashion designers including Versace, Gucci and Giorgio Armani have stopped or say they plan to stop using fur.\n\nUnder the California law, there is a fine of up to $1,000 for multiple violations.\n\nAnimal rights groups have said animals may be subject to gassing, electrocution and other inhumane actions to obtain their fur.\n\nAdvocacy group Direct Action Everywhere said it\u2019s working with activists to pass similar bills in cities nationwide, including Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon, and it\u2019s optimistic California\u2019s law will spur action.\n\n\u201cOrdinary people want to see animals protected, not abused,\u201d said Cassie King, an organizer with the Berkeley-based group.\n\nIn this Sept. 18, 2018, file photo, Margo Paine, center, joins protesters with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) holding signs to ban fur in Los Angeles prior to a news conference at Los Angeles City.

He further said fake fur is not a renewable or sustainable option.\n\nCalifornia joins New Jersey and Hawaii in banning most animals from circus performances.\n\nThe law exempts domesticated dogs, cats and horses and does not apply to rodeos.\n\nCircuses have been declining in popularity for decades. The most well-known act, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, closed in 2017 after 146 years of performances.\n\nState officials say at least two circuses that include live animals were scheduled to perform in California this year. At least 18 circuses don\u2019t use animals, including Cirque du Soleil.\n\nIn this July 7, 2016, file photo, led by three costumed tigers, dozens of animal rights protesters with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) gather at City Hall in Los Angeles to call on the city to prohibit using tigers, lions, and other wild animals in circuses. (Photo: Richard Vogel, AP)\n\nAt first, critics warned the proposal was too broad and would impact county fairs, wildlife rescues or rehabilitation organizations. In response, lawmakers narrowed the definition of circus to include \u201ca performance before a live audience in which entertainment consisting of a variety of acts such as acrobats, aerialists, clowns, jugglers, or stunts is the primary attraction or principal business.\u201d\n\nThe law includes penalties of up to $25,000 per day for each violation.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ben Hueso authored the measure, arguing wild animals in circuses endure cruel training and near-constant confinement.\n\nThe Southwest California Legislative Council opposed the law, saying it will prevent people from being able \u201cto experience the thrill of a circus performance featuring beautiful, well-cared-for animals.\u201d\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals lauded both new laws.\n\n\u201cToday is a historic day for animals in California, including those who have been whipped into performing in circuses, or skinned alive for their fur or skin,\u201d PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement.\n\nIn this Friday, March 16, 2018, file photo Benjamin Lin looks over a 60-year-old cheetah jacket he is restoring at the B.B.

California lawmakers slam utility amid widespread power outage\n\nThe head of the Human Society of the United States also praised the law about fur products.\n\n\u201cThe signing of AB 44 underscores the point that today\u2019s consumers simply don\u2019t want wild animals to suffer extreme pain and fear for the sake of fashion,\u201d said Kitty Block, the group\u2019s CEO and president. \u201cMore cities and states are expected to follow California\u2019s lead, and the few brands and retailers that still sell fur will no doubt take a closer look at innovative alternatives that don\u2019t involve animal cruelty.\u201d\n\nAlso Saturday, Newsom signed legislation aimed at helping protect horses from slaughter. The law requires public and private auction yard operators to post new signage, maintain sworn statements and post identifying information online starting Jan. 1.\n\nIt is key to ensuring California\u2019s horse population isn\u2019t illegally sent to slaughter, said the bill\u2019s author, Democratic Assemblyman Todd Gloria.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/13/california-bans-fur-sales-and-production-bars-animals-circuses/3968947002/", "description": "The fur law, signed Saturday by Gov.
