And past tense . . . I tried to remember where Rob had been the past hour while I was nursing. How long had he been alone in the bedroom? The bathroom?\n\nLong enough to swallow too many pills.\n\nI shook his shoulders, panicked. \"Rob, what did you do? Tell me!\"\n\nThe world settled into slow motion. As if hovering above the scene, I noticed the splotches on my shirt where my swollen breasts had leaked, the dead fly on the edge of the window sill, pine needles scattered yellow on the wet street, the baby\u2019s bubbly breaths behind me.\n\nThen time sped up and my brain raced into action: call an ambulance, try to make Rob throw up, pack diapers for the hospital. I was reaching for my phone to dial 911 when Rob finally responded.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said, almost too quiet to hear. \"I didn't do anything yet.\"\n\nMy exhale lifted the hair on his temple. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been holding my breath. \u201cAre you going to kill yourself?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe those words were coming out of my mouth. Or that I actually believed the answer was yes.\n\nIllness vs. 'powerful myth'\n\nThree months before Tyler was born, Rob began suffering from insomnia, paralyzing indecision and panic attacks. Neither of us had any previous experience with mental illness, and I didn\u2019t understand what was happening. My husband was always the even-keeled one, the one singing aloud in the grocery store and keeping his cool in crises.\n\nI attributed Rob\u2019s symptoms to the fact that we were adjusting to returning to life in the United States after spending a year abroad, both of us stressed as we searched for jobs and prepared to become parents.\n\nI dragged Rob to various doctors. One prescribed Ambien for sleep. Another recommended more exercise. Yet another gave him natural supplements to reduce stress. None of them seemed to recognize his mounting anxiety or the scale of his psychological pain.\n\nI had hoped that everything would get better after the baby came, that seeing his son\u2019s face would reset the broken parts of Rob\u2019s mind. Instead, everything shattered into finer pieces \u2014 he became sullen and withdrawn, convinced that he was doomed.\n\nAlthough Rob was eventually diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and severe depression, the psychiatrist never linked the illnesses to the changes associated with becoming a father.\n\nNeither did I. I thought only women experienced mental illness related to childbirth and that it only happened postpartum.\n\nBut when I finally confided in my friends about Rob\u2019s mental illness, I learned that he was not alone: Other dads in our community had suffered from anxiety or depression during their partner\u2019s pregnancy or during their child\u2019s infancy. Yet, like us, these families kept their distress quiet, not sure what to name it or how to resolve it.\n\nExpectations about how a new father should act do not include melting into a puddle on the living room floor. Yet research has found that 1 in 7 dads in the United States suffer from mood disorders during the perinatal period (the time before and after birth), which skyrockets to 1 in 4 dads in the three to six months postpartum.\n\nIf up to one-quarter of American men are afflicted with paternal mental illness, why is it still under the radar?\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s a stigma around mental health in general and an even heavier stigma around mental illness related to having a baby,\u201d explained Wendy Davis, the executive director of Postpartum Support International. At a time when Hallmark messages tell us we should be brim-full of joy and gratitude, any doubt or depression associated with becoming a parent is viewed as \u201ca personal failure,\u201d she said.\n\nWill Courtenay, a psycho\u00adtherapist, expert in men\u2019s health concerns and founder of \u00adPostpartumMen, agreed: \u201cThere\u2019s a very powerful myth in our society that men don\u2019t get depressed.\u201d\n\nCourtenay said entrenched cultural norms that men should be \u201cemotionally strong\u201d explain why even trained mental health clinicians are less likely to diagnose anxiety or depression in men than in women.\n\nAnother reason paternal mental illness is underdiagnosed is because it often appears differently from women. Depressed dads, Courtenay said, might act more frustrated, irritable and angry. Other red flags are emotional withdrawal, working constantly, complaining of pain with no cause, or an increase in risk-taking behaviors such as drinking, drugs, gambling or extramarital sex.\n\nProfessionals, and often family members, tend to write off a new dad\u2019s symptoms as a normal part of the transition to parenthood, which is what Rob experienced. People kept saying he\u2019d feel better if found a job. Or took a shower. Or got off the couch at all. When I felt the most overwhelmed by his flat stare and heavy silence (usually after a particularly rough night of tending to a colicky newborn by myself), I was guilty of saying the same unhelpful things \u2014 wishing out loud that Rob would \u201cjust get over it and stop moping around.\u201d\n\nBut a mood disorder is different from \u201cmoping around.\u201d A disorder can be diagnosed when a mental shift lasts longer than two weeks, interferes with daily functioning (including changes in sleeping, eating and physical performance), and creates a loss of identity. Rob was physically incapable of getting a job \u2014 he broke out in a cold sweat every time he had to leave the house. It was very obvious that the chemistry in his brain and body was off-kilter.\n\nAs with women, hormone changes can play a big role in a father\u2019s mood. Recent studies show that men\u2019s hormone levels fluctuate when their partner is expecting a baby, which is nature\u2019s way of priming dads to nurture their offspring. In general, when his partner is pregnant, a man\u2019s testosterone levels drop and he produces higher levels of estrogen, cortisol and even prolactin (the hormone that tells the body to make breast milk).\n\nBut if a man\u2019s hormonal shift is too big or too little, it can leave the father feeling stressed, aggressive or depressed. The hormonal changes can be compounded by lack of sleep once the baby arrives, which is known for its harmful effects on the mind and the nervous system.\n\nStruggles, stress, recovery\n\nOther countries are catching on that dads need more tools to cope with the sea change of becoming a parent. In Britain, dads are now screened if the mother is diagnosed with a perinatal mood disorder, because up to half of dads experience mental illness if the mother does, too. But we have a long way to go, said Andy Mayers, a psychologist at Bournemouth University in Britain.\n\n\u201cRecent research shows that we need to give dads early support so that it\u2019s less likely to escalate to the point of them needing medical intervention,\u201d Mayers said.\n\nMayers advocates universal perinatal mental health screening for both parents, as well as social groups specific to dads, such as online forums, monthly calls or community meetups.\n\nI didn\u2019t know any of this five years ago when my husband was sobbing on our floor. I, too, bought into the fiction that men aren\u2019t as affected by having a child. I know better now.\n\nDuring his year-long mental illness, Rob waged war every single day against an internal monologue that told him he was useless as a parent and as a partner, and that suicide was inevitable. One gray winter afternoon, he tattooed my name on one forearm and our son\u2019s on the other to remind him why it was worth continuing to fight a seemingly endless battle.\n\nI fought hard, too, learning how to care for a helpless infant and an equally helpless husband. Someone was always crying in our house \u2014 sometimes all of us at once. Each time I walked through our front door, I swallowed hard, hoping like hell that I wouldn\u2019t find that Rob had lost the battle.\n\nWe navigated Russian roulette medical treatments that included two dozen different prescription drugs, breathing machines, behavioral therapy and even hypnosis. Then, inexplicably, one spring afternoon Rob decided to trim the maple tree in our front yard. The next day he went for a walk. A week later he patted my back in the kitchen after dinner, a long-absent touch that brought hopeful tears to my eyes.\n\nSlowly, Rob came back to us. Slowly, our son learned that his dad could laugh. As the wounds started to heal, we began to talk about what had happened and how to prevent it from happening again \u2014 not just to Rob, but also to other parents who may be suffering in the dark.\n\nDaniel Singley, a psychologist and founder of the Center for Men\u2019s Excellence and \u00adPadreCadre.com, has studied what he calls the \u201cdude to dad transition\u201d for nearly a decade and says that connection is key for helping men navigate the transition to parenthood.\n\n\u201cStep one is having more conversations about the fact that it\u2019s not just women who experience perinatal mental health issues. Step two is providing men with a sense of community so they don\u2019t feel isolated,\u201d Singley said.\n\nSo here I am, starting a conversation: If your family is suffering, you are not alone. You are not a failure. You will get better. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help.\n\nSixteen months ago, Rob and I welcomed our daughter into the world. We made the decision to have another child with our eyes wide open to the potential pitfalls. This time, though, we managed to sidestep them, thanks largely to luck but also to the fact that we had shared our story with friends and family, creating a community better able to support us the second time around.\n\nPostpartum depression is one of the most common complications of childbirth\n\nFirst drug specifically for postpartum depression is approved\n\nResearch shows postpartum depression might affect dads too", "description": "We know how mothers can be affected, but what happens to fathers before and after childbirth is not so well recognized.", "authors": ["Brianna Randall"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=100", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
