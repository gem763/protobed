For example, a \u00a3200,000 mortgage taken over 25 years on the average two-year fixed rate would result in monthly repayments of \u00a3896.23.\n\nOn the five-year however, the monthly repayment would be \u00a3932.89, totalling a difference of \u00a336.66 per month.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there \u2013 the same mortgage on the average 10-year fixed rate would result in average monthly repayment so \u00a3948.42 \u2013 just \u00a315.53 per month more than the five year fixed-rate deal.\n\nThe average two-year fix has plateaued, while five and 10-year fixes have continued to drop\n\nWhat do I need to watch out for?\n\nA 10-year fix sounds like a great idea if you know exactly how your life is going to pan out over the next decade - but very few of us do, and so the extra security a 10-year deal brings is a trade-off against how flexible you want to be in the future.\n\nThe same can be said for a five-year deal, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nIf you find a deal you like the look of, read the small print to see what early repayment charges you may be liable for.\n\nFor example, late last year Yorkshire Building Society released an unusual 2.25 per cent interest seven-year fixed rate deal at 65 per cent loan-to-value.\n\nThis is a good rate, but the range carries a series of early repayment charges \u2013 5 per cent up to 2020, 4 per cent in 2022, and 3 per cent up to 2024 decreasing to 1.5 per cent in 2026.\n\nThis means that on a \u00a3200,000 mortgage balance, it'll cost you \u00a310,000 to get out of the deal before a year is up.\n\nEven if you decide to move in the final year - 2026 - you'll still have to pay an early exit fee of \u00a33,000 if you need a new mortgage on your next home.\n\nYou should be able to take a good fixed mortgage with you if you move, as most are portable. This means you can take your existing rate and terms to a new property.\n\nHowever, be careful to check how this would work in practice, as many people need to borrow more when they move house, usually to a bigger, more expensive home.\n\nAnother thing to check is the fee - lenders sneaked up product fees following the Bank of England's base rate rise last year, so use This is Money's true cost mortgage calculator to find out how much you'll actually be paying each month for each deal.\n\nFor example, Atom Bank's 95 per cent two-year fix is is at 2.84 per cent with no fee while Nottingham Building Society's's same offering is slightly lower at 2.80 per cent with a \u00a3999 fee.\n\nBut taking this fee into account, on a \u00a3200,000 mortgage taken over 25 years Atom's offering would be \u00a34.11 cheaper per month.\n\nTo find the best rates for yourself, you can use This is Money and L&C's mortgage finder tool.", "description": "It's the best time in seven years to lock into a longer mortgage as new data shows the gap between two and five-year fixes has shrunk to near-record lows.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
