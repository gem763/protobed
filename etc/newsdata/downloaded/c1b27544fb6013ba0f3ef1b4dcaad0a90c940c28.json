The fresh coat of paint and (virtual) new shelves make for welcome additions, but it\u2019s going to take some getting used to. Then there\u2019s the new community-centric game page display, which somewhat ironically has the community divided. Here are some tips to help you deal with all of that and more.\n\nAccessing the new library\n\nFor now, the new Steam library is still in beta, so by default, you\u2019re stuck with the old digs for a little longer. Savour these more innocent times, because when change comes, it strikes like an arrow. That\u2019s tip number one, and it also doubles as life advice.\n\nTip number two (but the first tip that exclusively applies to Steam): If you want to access the new library now, click the \u201cSteam\u201d drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of Steam, select \u201csettings,\u201d and click over to the \u201caccount\u201d tab. You should see a section labelled \u201cbeta participation.\u201d\n\nFrom there, select \u201cchange,\u201d because ultimately, you are the arbiter of change in your own life, not some mindless tumbleweed being blown whichever way the wind takes you (turns out the second tip was also life advice after all, surprise). Doing that should make a pop-up appear. Select \u201cSteam beta update,\u201d restart Steam, and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n\nHiding those pesky community features\n\nThe new Steam library is heavily community oriented, which isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s cup of tea. As far as I can tell, this is the most complained-about element of the overhaul at the time of writing. In particular, folks seem to take issue with the way that individual games\u2019 pages put the game activity of your friends and, regrettably, a whole bunch of randos front and centre. Fun fact: The Steam community likes to post porn! Not all of that porn gets moderated right away! Fortunately, your friends get prime real estate at the top of the activity feed, but even then, their achievements and screenshots can still spoil major portions of games you might be playing.\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s no option to entirely disable this, but there is a workaround. First, open up the same settings menu you used to enable the new library. This time, select the \u201clibrary\u201d tab. In there, you should see an option called \u201clow bandwidth mode.\u201d Select it. This will, among other things, disable community content by default. This doesn\u2019t remove your friends\u2019 accomplishments from the activity feed, so you\u2019ll still have to watch out for that, but it renders broader community content entirely optional.\n\nImproving performance\n\nIf you activated low bandwidth mode, you\u2019re already part of the way to shrinking the Goliath-like footprint of new Steam. Part two is just as easy. Simply go to the same too-tucked-away menu and select \u201clow performance mode.\u201d You\u2019ll lose out on a few graphical effects, but everything will load much faster. It\u2019s a worthwhile trade-off if you\u2019re running Steam on an older machine, or even if you\u2019ve got a snarling hotrod of a PC and just want to play your dang games already.\n\nDragging and dropping\n\nThe new Steam library places a big emphasis on \u201ccollections,\u201d which allow you to organise games according to Steam-generated tags or whatever arbitrary criteria you please.\n\nIf you want to add a new game to a collection, you can right click on that game and scroll down to \u201cadd to,\u201d but that\u2019s a pain. Instead, just drag that game\u2019s icon or title to whichever collection you please and drop it there. This works whether you\u2019re in the sub-menu for a particular collection or viewing your Steam library as a whole.\n\nStopping games before they start\n\nYou know the nightmare lurking in the heart of man, for you have lived it: You\u2019re scrolling through your Steam library, looking to play a particular game, but you\u2019re only half-thinking about the task at hand, and before you know it, you\u2019ve launched the wrong game.\n\nNow you have to watch a bunch of splash screens and other obligatory nonsense that you don\u2019t and will never under any condition give even a single shit about. Then, and only then, can you quit to desktop.\n\nIf, however, you look near a game\u2019s title in its new detail page after you\u2019ve launched it, you should see a big \u201cSTOP\u201d button. Hit that, and Steam will abort the launch. Thank god.\n\nViewing games by size on your hard drive\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, your hard drive is constantly on the brink of heaving its girth into an increasingly tantalising grave because you\u2019re terrible at efficiently managing space. However, eventually, something has to give, such as when it\u2019s time to install a new game.\n\nThe new Steam library makes it easy. In every category (or \u201cshelf,\u201d as Steam now calls them), there\u2019s a range of \u201csort by\u201d options, one of which is \u201csize on disk.\u201d You can do this for your entire library, or just in particular categories. Now go ask yourself if you\u2019re really ever going to finish Assassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey, or if it\u2019s time to say goodbye.\n\nYou have a bunch of new games now; don\u2019t panic\n\nAfter the library update, you might find your game collection looking a little more voluminous than before. This is because Steam now displays free-to-play games you\u2019ve played in your library, even if you don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d them or they\u2019ve been removed from the Steam store.\n\nSome Steam users may choose to wear this bigger, buffer game number as a badge of pride. However, if you don\u2019t want your library cluttered up by games that you may never play again, you can just create a collection dedicated to free-to-play games and then, in the library\u2019s list view, shift-click all of those games, right click, go to the \u201cmanage\u201d tab, and click on \u201chide selected games.\u201d\n\nSorting your pile of shame\n\nIf you really enjoy feeling bad about yourself, why not formalise the list of games that you feel ashamed you haven\u2019t gotten around to playing? When creating a new collection, there\u2019s now a category for \u201cplay state.\u201d This includes an \u201cunplayed\u201d option, which will group together every game you\u2019ve never laid a finger on, you constantly overwhelmed, guilt-ridden game goblin.\n\nToday I learned that I have exactly 666 unplayed games on Steam. \u201cSee you in hell,\u201d I\u2019ll tell my game collection when I\u2019m on my deathbed. \u201cYou tell them who sent you,\u201d it\u2019ll reply.", "description": "Yesterday, Steam\u2019s first big library overhaul in eons entered open beta.
