But others said they were \"obviously sarcastic.\"\n\nReporter Ben Penn published a piece headlined, \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface,\u201d which detailed now-former Dept. of Labor staffer Leif Olson\u2019s sudden resignation.\n\nOlson reportedly resigned from his position after the reporter asked the DOL for comment on Facebook posts he posted in 2016 when Paul Nehlen lost to Paul Ryan in the Wisconsin Republican primary.\n\nNBC, COMCAST SILENT ON LAWRENCE O\u2019DONNELL\u2019S RETRACTED REPORT THAT BYPASSED MSNBC\u2019S VERIFICATION PROCESS\n\n\u201cOlson, an unsuccessful GOP candidate in 2012 for a Texas district court judgeship, fired off a series of late-night posts on his personal Facebook page three years ago that started as a sarcastic quip about former House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s blowout primary victory. They then devolved into an exchange referencing two anti-Semitic tropes: that Jews control the media and that they look out for members of their own faith,\u201d Penn wrote.\n\nOlson was a Ryan supporter in 2016 when his primary opponent was Nehlen, a self-described \u201cpro-White\u201d candidate with a history of defending white supremacist messages on social media. Olson took to Facebook after Ryan's victory and appeared to mock a Nehlen supporter with a series of messages.\n\nOlson told Penn that the remarks were simply \u201csarcastic criticism of the alt-right\u2019s conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic positions\u201d and declined to comment on why he resigned from his job as a senior policy adviser.\n\nPenn noted that \u201ca review of a decade of Olson\u2019s Facebook posts shows that he usually promotes his Christian faith and conservative views\u201d and the \u201cRyan exchange appears to be the only appeal to Jewish stereotypes.\u201d\n\nWHITE HOUSE SLAMS MSNBC FOR UNVERIFIED REPORT, SAYS LEFT-WING OUTLETS HAVE 'WEAPONIZED' THE MEDIA\n\nMedia members on both sides of the political spectrum have scolded Penn over the report.\n\n\u201cThis article is a joke. The comments in question are so obviously sarcastic it would take willful blindness to miss it,\u201d conservative commentator Ben Shapiro wrote.\n\nNew York Magazine writer Jonathan Chait called the situation \u201cterribly unfair\u201d and laid out his reasoning in a series of tweets.\n\n\u201cTrump Labor official Leif Olson has resigned due to a putatively anti-Semitic Facebook post. But if you read the post, it appears to be mocking anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,\u201d Chait wrote. \u201cLet's walk through it. The context for the post is a primary challenge to Paul Ryan by anti-Semitic right-winger Paul Nehlen\u2026 In the post that got him fired, Olson was mocking Nehlen and the logic of his supporters.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChait added, \u201cI'm not endorsing Olson or his policies, and I'm sure he has all kinds of objectionable beliefs. But firing him as an anti-Semite over this post strikes me as terribly unfair.\u201d\n\nNeither Penn nor Bloomberg Law immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cTo Leif Olson's friends & others who take issue with this reporting, I sent a screenshot of a public FB post to DOL, seeking comment. 4 hours later I received this response: \u2018Today, the Department of Labor accepted the resignation of Leif Olson effective immediately,\u2019\u201d Penn tweeted.\n\nCNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT\n\nPenn also shared a series of direct messages that New York Post columnist John Podhoretz sent over the Bloomberg report.\n\nOlson responded in a lengthy Facebook message where he said, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when making fun of alt-right anti-Semites led to being branded as an anti-Semite, but here we are.\"\n\nThe Department of Labor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOthers were also outraged by the situation:", "description": "Critics took to social media Tuesday after\u00a0a Trump Labor Department official\u00a0resigned following a Bloomberg Law reporter asking about the staffer's old Facebook posts that he labeled anti-Semitic.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
