James Smith, who called a non-emergency police number, said he saw the doors were open and the lights were on, which struck him as unusual. He knew Jefferson, his neighbor, was home with her 8-year-old nephew.\n\nPolice parked around the corner, so the woman couldn\u2019t see them, according to Smith, 62. About 15 minutes later, he said, he heard a loud bang and saw several more officers rush inside.\n\nExplore where you live. Subscribe for 12 FREE weeks of unlimited digital access.

In the back of home, one officer appears to see a figure through a dark window, and he quickly twists his body to the left.\n\n\u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d he shouts through the window, his gun drawn. He then fires a single shot through the window.\n\nHe does not identify himself as a police officer in the video.\n\nPolice said in the statement that the officer, who joined the department in April 2018, saw a person standing inside the home near a window.\n\n\u201cPerceiving a threat, the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOfficers entered the residence locating the individual and a firearm and began providing emergency medical care.\u201d\n\nPolice released photos of a gun they said that they found in a bedroom at the house. Police did not say whether Jefferson was holding the weapon when the officer shot her.\n\nJefferson was pronounced dead at the scene. The officer has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation, police said.\n\nThe East Allen Avenue shooting was the seventh time since June 1 that a Fort Worth police officer has shot a civilian. Six of those people died.\n\nMayor Betsy Price and City Manager David Cooke canceled a trip to Phoenix they had planned to begin Sunday to attend economic development meetings because of Jefferson\u2019s death.\n\nThe police major case unit, internal affairs unit and the Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s Office were on the scene Saturday.\n\nSmith, who has lived on the street for 50 years, said he had been trying to be a good neighbor, calling police on a non-emergency number so they could check on the woman. But he was wrestling with his emotions after a sleepless night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaken. I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m upset. And I feel it\u2019s partly my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\n\nSHARE COPY LINK\n\nThe south Fort Worth community was jolted by news that felt like a familiar story, and later in the day more than 10 black community leaders and pastors held a press conference to call on city leadership to act quickly and hold the officer in question accountable.\n\nPastor Michael Bell, speaking inside his own Greater Saint Stephen Baptist Church, read the police statement after it was released about noon and offered an immediate response. He wondered, visibly emotional and upset, how a person could be a \u201cperceived threat\u201d inside of her own home.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no \u2018perceived threat\u2019 \u2014 unless it\u2019s black folk,\u201d he said. \u201cJust our presence \u2014 we\u2019re the threat.\u201d\n\nPolice said they wanted to be transparent with a quick response in releasing some body camera video. But they said they were unable to release video from inside the house, citing state law.\n\nPolice did not respond to a list of questions sent by the Star-Telegram, including if the woman had been holding a weapon, what the officer perceived as a threat and if officers knocked on the front door or identified themselves as police officers.\n\n\u201cBeing the preliminary stages of this critical investigation we have provided all the information we have available to release at this time,\u201d Lt. Brandon O\u2019Neil, a police spokesman, said in an email.\n\n\u2018It makes you not want to call the police department\u2019\n\nSmith said his neighbors look after each other. When he called the non-emergency number early Saturday morning, he said he told police he was simply worried about the welfare of his neighbor and her nephew, he said.\n\nThey typically live with an aunt who has been in the hospital, he said. His grandchildren, nieces and nephews play with the 8-year-old who was inside the house, and he often worries about the boy crossing the street.\n\nHis niece, who also lives on East Allen Avenue, had initially told him about the open doors and the lights, and when he saw it himself, he thought it was concerning.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the doors open, I thought about [the child,] I thought about his grandma, I thought about his aunt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wanted to make sure they were safe. That\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nBut around 9 a.m. on Saturday, as he stood outside the woman\u2019s home, he wondered if he had done the right thing. Pastor Kyev Tatum, a community activist, was with him, comforting him.\n\nHe knows his street has a bad reputation, Smith said. Maybe, he wondered, police \u201cthought they were coming to something they weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe shooting has left him feeling angry and upset, he said, but also saddened.\n\n\u201cIt makes you not want to call the police department,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel safe with the police department, then who do you feel safe with? Do you just ignore crime or ignore something that\u2019s not right?\n\n\u201cThey tell you, \u2018If you see something, say something. ...Well, if you do that and it costs somebody to lose their life, it makes you not want to do that. And that\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nSHARE COPY LINK", "description": "Fort Worth police released body camera video Saturday of a deadly officer-involved shooting on Allen Ave. An officer shot and killed a woman in her home after a neighbor called police because a door was open.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/2pfz02/picture236076443/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Allen%20St.%20shooting%201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
