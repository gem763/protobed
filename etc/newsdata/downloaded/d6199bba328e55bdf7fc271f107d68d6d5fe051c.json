(AP) - A food bank that serves roughly 1,100 people in Pierce County, Washington was damaged in a fire Friday, and officials don\u2019t yet know how much food, if any, can be saved.\n\nFamilies in need of food showed up throughout the day of the fire and were directed to other food banks for help, Spanaway Food Bank director Harold Smith said.\n\n\u201cThe first step is just to make sure that the people who come here have a place to go,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, I\u2019m devastated.\u201d\n\nThe food bank\u2019s freezers and refrigerators were lost in the fire, and the food might not be salvageable, Smith said. The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department will make the final determination.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re destroyed at this point,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe fire was reported around 6 a.m. and was \u201cheavily involved in fire\u201d when crews arrived, Central Pierce Fire & Rescue spokesman Darrin Shaw said. At least one of the six portable structures that make up the food bank complex is a total loss, he said.\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn\u2019t immediately known.\n\nThe Spanaway Food Bank is staffed entirely by volunteers, and it has operated for over 40 years. The bank hands out about 15,000 pounds of food each month, with families generally coming by once or twice a month for supplies, Smith said.\n\nThe fire could not have come at a worse time, he said.\n\n\u201cOur busiest time for receiving funds and food are this time of year,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEverybody thinks about the food bank this time of year. This is our biggest collection time and consistently our biggest distribution time as well. So it\u2019s sickening, it\u2019s just sickening.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, the food bank will be rebuilt.\n\n\u201cWe are going to rebuild, without a doubt \u2014 we\u2019ve just been here too long,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all get together and rally. Pray for us.\u201d\n\nMichelle Douglas, the chief executive officer of the Emergency Food Network, said the Spanaway Food Bank is one of 80 food resource sites served by the network. She said Emergency Food Network workers can direct clients to an alternative food bank for now. The organization is also collecting monetary donations for the Spanaway Food Bank, Douglas said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A food bank that serves roughly 1,100 people in Pierce County, Washington was damaged in a fire Friday, and officials don't yet know how much food, if any, can be saved.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
