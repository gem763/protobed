The show was quickly scrubbed from the Chinese internet.\n\nA check of the popular video streaming sites Youku and Bilibili turned up zero mentions of \u201cSouth Park.\u201d A search on the search engine Baidu did pull up mentions of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d but some results were removed.\n\nCreators Trey Parker and Matt Stone issued a faux apology, saying, \u201cLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy.\u201d\n\nThey were referring to a rapidly deleted tweet by the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting the Hong Kong protests. That angered Chinese authorities, with the state broadcaster canceling plans to show a pair of preseason games this week and reviewing all cooperation and exchanges with the league.\n\nMeanwhile, video games maker Activision Blizzard said Tuesday it kicked a Hong Kong esports pro out of a tournament and seized his prize money after he voiced support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protest movement.\n\nThe company also said it suspended Ng-wai Chung, known as Blitzchung, from the Hearthstone Grandmaster card game for a year.\n\nChung\u2019s offense was to shout \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d during a post-game interview on the weekend with two Taiwanese \u201ccasters,\u201d or hosts, who ducked under their desk, apparently not wanting to be associated with the slogan used by protesters in the semiautonomous Chinese city.\n\nUnder the game\u2019s rules, players can be removed for behavior that results in public disrepute, offends the public or damages its image, Blizzard said, adding that the two hosts were also fired.\n\nChinese authorities generally do not officially comment on the myriad acts of censorship carried out on the Internet and in other forms every day.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver was trying to find a middle way as the league faced a firestorm sparked by Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nOn a visit to Tokyo, Silver said he and the league are \u201capologetic\u201d that so many Chinese officials and fans were upset, but also said he isn\u2019t apologizing for Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d", "description": "The episode comes as the NBA suffered backlash in China over a pro-Hong Kong tweet by the Houston Rockets general manager.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS864_Southp_ZG_20191008104536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
