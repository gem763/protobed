They want to make sure a \"no-deal\" departure is blocked before agreeing to an election.\n\nA new bill that seeks to force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay before the Oct. 31 deadline is set to become law on Monday.\n\nJohnson has said he will not seek a delay. His government is studying the bill for possible loopholes that might allow a legal challenge.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson voiced optimism Monday that a new Brexit deal can be reached so Britain leaves the European Union by Oct. 31.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275705.1568022171!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ireland-brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
