(Oct. 15) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Underscoring the fast-moving diplomacy around the White House's attempt to get Turkey to call a cease-fire in Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan abruptly reversed course Wednesday and said he will meet Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when they arrive in Turkey on Thursday. Earlier, Erdogan ruled out the meeting and said he'd only meet with President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump is not traveling to Turkey.\n\nPence and Pompeo leave for Ankara on Wednesday afternoon. News of Erdogan's refusal to meet with them was first reported by Sky News, a British broadcaster.\n\nErdogan subsequently confirmed he would meet with the senior American officials in a brief statement to Turkish media that was tweeted out by his communications director.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear why he changed his mind.\n\nAlso earlier, Erdogan rejected Trump's request in a phone conversation to call a halt to Turkish military operations in northeastern Syria. Turkey's leader said he will not negotiate with Kurdish forces his government is trying to push out of the area.\n\n\"They say 'declare a cease-fire.' We will never declare a cease-fire,\" Erdogan told reporters on a flight back from Baku late on Tuesday where he attended a regional business summit in Azerbaijan's capital.\n\nIn an address to Turkey's Parliament on Wednesday, Erdogan said that Turkey's military offensive would end if Syrian Kurdish fighters left a border area in northeast Syria, according to the country's official Anadolu news agency.\n\nThe Trump administration is scrambling to contain the escalating domestic and international fallout from President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, a move that paved the way for Turkey's assault on Syrian Kurdish fighters who it considers to be terrorists. U.S.-led coalition forces have for the last several years successfully partnered with Syrian Kurds to fight the Islamic State group.\n\nWho are the Kurds?: A Middle Eastern people with 'no friends but the mountains'\n\nLawmakers in Congress, back from a two-week recess, lashed out at Trump's decision and laid the groundwork for a legislative crackdown Wednesday on Turkey that would go beyond the White House's move to sanction Turkey over its military invasion.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., derided Trump's sanctions on Turkey as a \"wet noodle\" and said she would push a bipartisan resolution rebuking the president's withdrawal, which she and others have portrayed as a betrayal of Kurdish fighters who helped the U.S. battle Islamic State terrorists in Syria.\n\n\"The president gave the green light to Turkey to go in and commit this humanitarian disaster unto the Kurds, making us an untrustworthy ally,\" Pelosi told reporters Tuesday. \"And then had a wet noodle for his sanctions, which just were not up to the task.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaking on the lawn of the White House. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP)\n\nRepublicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, warned that \"leaving the field now\" would allow the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, to make a comeback and create a vacuum in Syria for Iran and Russia to fill.\n\nOver the last few years, Syria's Kurds have carved out a semi-autonomous state on territory that once belonged to the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. While Syria's Kurds are considered to be some of the region's bravest and most able military fighters, they have recognized they are ultimately no match for Turkey's far larger and better equipped military. After Trump announced the U.S. troop withdrawal, Kurdish leaders entered into an agreement with Assad to try to stem Turkey's advance. Assad's forces, in turn, are backed by Russia's military, an alliance that has enabled him to slowly turn the tide of Syria's nearly decade-long civil war in his favor.\n\nAs Russia has moved to fill the void left by the U.S. withdrawal from the conflict, French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said in an interview on French television channel BFM Wednesday that France is now looking to Russia for help, given their \"common interests\" in defeating ISIS in Syria. France and a number of other countries have also banned weapons sales to Turkey. The U.S. is still selling arms to Turkey.\n\nTrump has invited Pelosi and McConnell, along with other congressional leaders, to the White House Wednesday afternoon for a meeting on the crisis.\n\nAmerican withdrawal: Russia takes over key U.S. outposts in Syria\n\nPence and Pompeo are expected to press Turkey to enact a cease-fire. A senior Trump administration official declined to detail the U.S. delegation's schedule in Turkey, but said U.S. officials would use the threat of additional U.S. sanctions as leverage to pressure Erdogan to stop his military's advance into northeastern Syria.\n\nBut the Turkish leader has signaled no interest in a cease-fire and apparently little fear of U.S. sanctions, partly because Russia's military presence makes it the de facto power broker in the conflict. Erdogan said the offensive would continue until Turkey achieves its aims completely, which is to create a \"safe zone\" between Turkey and Syria that acts as a buffer area to Syria's Kurds. The \"safe zone\" would also enable Turkey to resettle several million Syrian refugees currently living on its territory in volatile border areas.\n\nErdogan has shrugged off the threat of additional U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"They are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions,\" Erdogan said on his way back from Azerbaijan, according to comments first reported by the Reuters news agency.\n\nWhat we know: Turkey's offensive in Syria\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/16/trump-faces-chaos-backlash-syria-turkey-rebuffs-ceasefire/3993179002/", "description": "Turkey's President\u00a0Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he will, after all, meet with\u00a0Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo when they\u00a0arrive in Turkey on Thursday.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Kim Hjelmgaard", "Published A.M.
