Moore's death was initially classified as an accidental methamphetamine overdose.\n\nBuck, a well-known figure in LGBT political circles, has given more than $500,000 to a range of Democratic groups and candidates \u2014 including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\nMAN WHO DIED IN DEMOCRATIC MEGADONOR ED BUCK'S HOME CALLED HIM A 'F---ING DEVIL,' REPORT SAYS\n\nAccording to NBC4, the suit was filed in LA Superior Court and alleges wrongful death, sexual battery, hate violence, drug dealer liability, negligence, infliction of emotional distress, and two violations of civil rights.

Dean, 55, reportedly had a relationship with Buck years before Moore\u2019s death.\n\nDean reportedly warned his friends to steer clear of Buck and referred to him as a \"f---ing devil\" and \"a horrible, horrible man.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDean is said to have specifically told a friend in the fall that he had no intention of visiting Buck, and that \u201che didn\u2019t want to end up dead.\u201d\n\nHollie McKay and Christopher Carbone contributed to this report.", "description": "The mother of a man who died in the West Hollywood apartment of prominent Democratic Party donor Ed Buck filed a wrongful-death lawsuit Tuesday.", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
