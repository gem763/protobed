And as a result of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s strategy of not \u201cfocusing on Trump,\u201d the president has every reason to scoff at the prospect of aggressive congressional oversight, up to and including a genuine \u201cgo big\u201d effort at impeachment.\n\nCombined, these elements must force us to consider a truly horrifying series of questions: Does President Trump have the means, motive, and opportunity to tilt the 2020 election? The answer, unfortunately, is yes, yes, and yes. And it behooves Democrats to understand that now, before it is too late.", "description": "The president has given us ample signs that he will use the powers of the presidency in ways previously unimaginable.
