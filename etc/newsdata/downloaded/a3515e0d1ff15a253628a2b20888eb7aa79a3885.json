The scientific paper written by Dr Michael Darby describes and names the new species of beetle Nelloptodes gretae that measures about one millimetre (0.04 inch) long\n\nDr Darby spotted the beetle while he was studying the museum's Spirit Collection.\n\nDr Max Barclay, senior curator in charge of Coleoptera at the Natural History Museum, said: 'The name of this beetle is particularly poignant since it is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them.\n\n'So it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species.'\n\nThe beetle has been featured in The Entomologist journal's monthly magazine.\n\nMs Thunberg was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, which was later awarded to Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.", "description": "London's Natural History Museum has named the 1mm-long beetle, which was discovered in Kenya in 1965, Nelloptodes gretae in honour of the 16-year-old's tireless environmental work.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20183220-0-image-a-28_1572013578448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
