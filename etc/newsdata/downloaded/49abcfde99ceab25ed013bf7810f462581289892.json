The stock traded as low as $148.50, its lowest since Aug. 28.\n\nOf the 27 analysts surveyed by FactSet, at least four analysts downgraded FedEx\u2019s shares and 10 analysts cut their price targets for the stock. The average rating remains overweight, and the average price target was lowered to $171.23 from $180.52 as of the end of August.\n\nAnalyst David Ross at Stifel Nicolaus downgraded the package delivery company to hold, after being at buy since March 2018, and cut his price target to $171 from $185. Ross said he expects the stock to continue to underperform over the next few quarters as the global economy is unlikely to rebound in 2020.\n\nKeyBanc Capital\u2019s Todd Fowler also cut his rating to sector weight, after being at overweight for at least the past two years, citing a softer international outlook, a downbeat outlook on FedEx Ground margins and concerns over the need of increased near-term business investment.\n\nFedEx also got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets\u2019 Fadi Chamoun, who said that while his team continued to be positive on the long-term outlook, \u201cnear-term challenges are larger than anticipated and visibility into a positive inflection point in fundamentals is limited.\u201d\n\nThose analysts who kept their ratings intact were quick to point out to that uncertainty going forward.\n\nThe guidance cut could mean FedEx\u2019s profits hit their lowest, but it is \u201chard to see a path to a rebound\u201d and sustained growth, analysts at Morgan Stanley, led by Ravi Shanker, said in a note. Enough \u201cstructural headwinds\u201d remain to keep earnings under pressure for a while, they said.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs, led by Jordan Alliger, said FedEx\u2019s outlook was \u201cquite disappointing\u201d even as the analysts didn\u2019t have high expectations for the quarter. They kept their buy rating on the stock, however, taking \u201cthe forest through the trees approach,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cPutting the economy aside, fundamentally FedEx is very well-positioned to remain at the forefront of global, time definite delivery, with very few companies able to meet the demand for ever tighter delivery time frames,\u201d the Goldman analysts said. \u201cThis gives comfort that the business model itself is not broken long term.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Peter Tyler Brown at Raymond James also kept the equivalent of a buy on FedEx shares, saying his team \u201cremain optimistic in the long-term earnings power\u201d of FedEx\u2019s ground shipping business and believe its freight business, underpinned by the company\u2019s \u201cdominant\u201d network of terminals could continue to drive earnings growth.\n\nMoreover, once TNT is fully integrated, its road network can provide \u201csubstantial cost savings in Europe\u201d for FedEx, they said. FedEx bought TNT in 2016.\n\nFedEx in August ended its contract to deliver Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, -0.28% ground packages, and in June ended its FedEx Express domestic contract with e-commerce giant.\n\nFedEx losses on Wednesday weighed on the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -1.21% and also on rival United Parcel Service Inc.\u2019s UPS, -1.10% shares. FedEx shares have lost 7% this year, contrasting with gains of 20% and 16% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.03% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, +0.13%\n\nTomi Kilgore in New York contributed to this report", "description": "FedEx stock tanks as several analysts downgrade it following a quarterly miss and a steep outlook cut for the logistics company.", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ746_Fedex__ZG_20181205131743.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
