But the contract -- unthinkable for Microsoft even a year ago -- will likely come at a cost, legal and internal.\n\nAmazon.com Inc., the market leader in cloud services, is considering a challenge to the award of the contract to Microsoft\u2019s much smaller Azure business, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s interference in the bidding process, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon had been widely considered the front-runner because of its superior size and previous cloud contract with the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nMeantime, Microsoft employees have protested involvement in the contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, intended to bring U.S. military technology into the modern era.\n\n\u201cWe are disheartened that Microsoft accepted the JEDI contract,\u201d a group of employees wrote on Twitter. \u201cAs Microsoft workers, we are now complicit of \u2018increasing the lethality\u2019 of the U.S. Department of Defense.\u201d\n\nThe group, calling itself Microsoft Workers 4 Good, was quoting a Defense Department official\u2019s description of the contract\u2019s goal.\n\nMicrosoft shares jumped as much as 4.1% in before-market trading on Monday from a close of $140.73 on Friday in New York. If it maintains the gain, the stock will trade at a record level.\n\nMicrosoft has said it will continue to pursue government and military work, despite objections from some employees. The company will also be involved in bids for a second large Defense contract that involves cloud-based email and collaboration software.\n\nMicrosoft says workers can request to be moved to other projects. But that is no simple matter in huge cloud efforts: Sales, marketing, engineering and data center operations can involve tens of thousands of workers.\n\nNo matter the potential problems, the contract remains a major win for one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies -- showing investors and potential customers that it is a strong alternative to Amazon Web Services, which has been for years considered the default choice.\n\n\u201cThis is a paradigm changer for Microsoft,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s a landmark win that will change the cloud computing battle over the next decade. It\u2019s a shocker to Amazon and Bezos to lose it.\n\n\u201cBut for Microsoft it signals a new era of growth in cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cThis adds $10 to the stock in my opinion.\u201d\n\nIn the past year, Azure has racked up some large deals from Kroger Co. to AT&T Inc., but a customer as big, demanding and secretive as the Pentagon will go a long way toward cementing Azure\u2019s reputation as a serious contender.\n\nAmazon, which won a lucrative cloud contract with the Central Intelligence Agency in 2013, was seen to have the upper hand in the competition. But politics entered the picture. Trump has long been at odds with Amazon\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos. The world\u2019s richest man also owns the Washington Post, which Trump claims has treated him unfairly in its coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised about this conclusion,\u201d said Douglas Stone, an Amazon spokesman.\n\nHe added that the company was \u201cthe clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion. We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield.\u201d\n\nAmazon Web Services, the retail giant\u2019s cloud computing arm, has a wide lead in the business of selling cloud services to businesses and governments, with $32.5 billion in sales during the most recently reported 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft, which doesn\u2019t break out comparable sales for its Azure unit, likely pulled in a fraction of that, analysts say. Based on both companies\u2019 earnings reports last week, Synergy Research Group expects Amazon to boost its share of the market to about 33.5% and Microsoft to rise to around 16.5%.\n\nTrump surprised the industry earlier this year when he openly questioned whether the contract was being competitively bid.\n\nA new book by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, alleges that Trump, in the summer of 2018, told Mattis to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d and lock it out of the bid. Mattis didn\u2019t do what Trump asked, Snodgrass wrote. Mattis has criticized the book.Amazon was believed to be the front-runner until Friday evening.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. shares surged after the company scored a major victory in securing a milestone, $10 billion Pentagon contract for cloud computing services.
