The presidential candidates continue to prove this by proposing energy policies that would devastate the American economy while ignoring the appalling impact of Chinese pollution on the atmosphere.\n\nMarianne Williamson declared that we need to act \u201cradically\u201d to avert \u201cmassive food shortages\u201d and \u201chundreds of millions of environmental refugees.\u201d As unhinged as she sounds, she is stating the Democratic Party platform as dictated by progressives such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Williamson is not even an outlier among her fellow candidates, many of whom have endorsed the preposterous Green New Deal.\n\nSome candidates have even crafted their own versions of the Green New Deal, but the most frightening manifestation of such climate extremism is that some candidates are now pledging to ban fossil fuels, a move that would dramatically raise energy prices in places such as Ohio, which is among the top states that consumer natural gas in the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,\u201d Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race Democratic lawmakers, 2020 candidates pay tribute to Conyers 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE said during the presidential debate in Texas. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Tlaib endorses Sanders at Detroit campaign rally MORE, another leading face of the Democratic Party, pledged to \u201csign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands\u201d and upped the ante with a plan to ban fracking across the country.\n\nA fracking ban would tear a gaping hole through the fabric of the Ohio economy, which has benefited greatly from the shale boom. An Ohio University professor calculated that the shale industry contributed more than $22 billion to the state economy and supported nearly 150,000 jobs in 2015 alone, and that was before the energy boom we have experienced here since President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE began rolling back the draconian Obama era regulations that kept our energy sector from reaching full potential.\n\nBehind the scenes, longshot candidates such as Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has come out with his own multitrillion dollar plan to \u201cfree ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology,\u201d are doing their best to keep pace with the front runners. While these proposals are understandably terrifying for Ohioans, they represent the sort of damage that elicits standing ovations in Beijing. For all their talk of environmental protections, the Democrats are shockingly unconcerned about the devastating carbon footprint of China.\n\nThis inexplicable hypocrisy should be concerning to genuine climate activists striving to promote clean water and air across the globe. After all, it is no secret that rampant Chinese pollution will easily outweigh our efforts to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cAll of the gains that we have made are offset exponentially by the Chinese,\u201d said Energy Department deputy secretary Dan Brouillette in a recent interview, noting that the 14 percent reduction in American energy emissions that has occurred since President Trump withdrew the United States from the disastrous Paris climate agreement is offset by about a monthly worth of Chinese emissions increases. \u201cThey are making near zero progress regarding these types of issues,\u201d Brouillette added.\n\nThe Democrats are well aware of this problem, yet they tout energy policies that would cripple the American economy without achieving meaningful environmental objectives, proving they are exploiting the issue of climate change as a vehicle for their socialist ambitions.\n\nMadison Gesiotto is an attorney and a commentator who serves with the advisory board of the Donald Trump campaign.
