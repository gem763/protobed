They all did.\n\n\"I can tell you I heard clearly from [the mayors] that many of them want us to bring a national [handgun] ban,\" Trudeau said afterward.\n\nWhile rejecting the idea of a national ban, Trudeau promised a re-elected Liberal government would give individual municipalities the authority to ban or restrict handguns on their own.\n\nBut the reaction of the assembled mayors to a signature Liberal campaign pledge shows that some municipalities want Ottawa to do much more.\n\n\"We would obviously prefer that the handgun ban be national. They're not prepared to go forward right now,\" Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie told reporters after the event. \"But they have introduced other measures, including funding, enhanced funding, that will go directly to the cities and they are banning semi-automatic assault weapons.\"\n\nAsked why his party would pursue a limited ban instead of one covering handguns, Trudeau punted the question. \"We are taking the strongest step in Canadian history to move forward on tougher gun legislation,\" he replied.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also has proposed giving municipalities the power to ban handguns. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said these policies would do little reduce gun violence because they target legal firearms owners instead of criminals. Scheer has promised what he's calling a tough-on-crime approach to gangs, including new bail restrictions and longer sentences for gang-related offences.\n\nInstead of a cross-country handgun ban, the Liberal Party has promised to pursue a ban on \"military-style assault rifles\" like those used in recent mass shootings in the U.S.\n\n\"These guns are designed to inflict mass casualties and have no place in Canada. Canadians are tired of excuses and know that 'thoughts and prayers' don't make our communities any safer,\" the Liberal platform reads.\n\nMost gun-related homicides in Canada \u2014 65.3 per cent of the total in 2018, according to Statistics Canada \u2014 are carried out with handguns.\n\nWhile police don't have accurate data on the origin of crime guns, hundreds of guns are confiscated by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) every year as gang members procure illegal firearms from the U.S. to carry out their crimes.\n\n'Military' and 'assault' style firearms to be banned\n\nThe Liberals haven't said which firearms would be classified as \"military\" or \"assault\" style according to their policy. As it stands, those terms have no legal definitions.\n\nTrudeau said Tuesday he'd rely on the advice of experts to determine \"which guns are which.\"\n\nA re-elected Liberal government would offer owners of such military-style weapons a \"buyback program\" at \"fair market prices\" for firearms legally purchased in Canada.\n\nThere are more than a million restricted and prohibited firearms in Canada. But not all of them are considered \"assault\" weapons \u2014 making it very difficult to estimate the potential cost of a buyback program.\n\nFor a similar program, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern earmarked $125 million to buy back about 175,000 firearms in that country.\n\nPolice Sr. Sgt.

So are fully automatic firearms that can unleash a flurry of bullets in seconds.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday why he's principally focused on firearms that are used less often in homicides, Trudeau pointed out there's still a grim history of violence associated with such weapons \u2014 the 1989 Polytechnique massacre and the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting being the better-known examples.\n\n\"We need to strengthen gun control in this country. And the choice is clear. Liberals are going to strengthen gun control. Conservatives want to weaken gun control,\" he said.", "description": "Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau had mayors from the Greater Toronto Area on hand Tuesday as he touted his party's promise to crack down on firearms \u2014 but all those assembled suggested the federal government should go beyond what Trudeau has promised.", "authors": ["Parliamentary Bureau", "John Paul", "J.P.", "Tasker Is A Reporter In The Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau In Ottawa.
