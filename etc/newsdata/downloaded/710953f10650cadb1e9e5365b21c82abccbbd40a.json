In running through them at will, Sterling also ran the game. His surges were the direct source of three of England\u2019s five goals, having also nodded the equaliser.\n\nThat was Sterling\u2019s second headed goal of the season, reflecting the improvement in his movement, and one of many reasons he has moved onto another level.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And just as he has entered his prime \u2013 and started operating at that truly elite standard \u2013 it has naturally followed that he has become England\u2019s most important player. This is not to diminish Harry Kane, but the bald fact is that Sterling\u2019s contribution to the overall attacking movement of the team currently surpasses that of the Tottenham Hotspur striker.\n\nSterling just brings so much together, ties so much together to then unleash it, and all because he has got to that point the top players do when it all just comes together for them.\n\nIt has clicked.\n\nOne figure familiar with how City work says a key to this is how Sterling now has \u201ca complete understanding of his own strengths and weaknesses\u201d.\n\nThat has partly come from a complete understanding of the game. Those who have worked with Sterling say that, even in his best season at Liverpool in 2013-14, he was a \u201cstraight-lines player\u201d. It was why he might have initially plateaued at City under Manuel Pellegrini, who played boxier formations.\n\nPep Guardiola immediately addressed that. No player is restricted to effective tram-lines in his formations, and especially not fluid forwards of such potential. There is constant rotation, constant movement.\n\nOne of the core tenets of Guardiola\u2019s entire approach is getting players to mentally register the idea of a pitch being divided into 18 different areas, and where to move within them in relation to the ball, their own teammates and the opposition.\n\nIt can take a lot to get your head around, which was why the Catalan\u2019s first season at City was so underwhelming. Once it sinks in, though, the effects are\u2026 well, what we\u2019ve seen for the last two years. And what we\u2019re seeing now with Sterling.\n\nHe gets it. But he doesn\u2019t just get the idea. It has all given him a deeper idea of how the game works. It is like he is now seeing it in 4-D. It has given him a complete understanding of positioning, of how to use space. The same source likens some of it to how the Germans coach, and Thomas Muller\u2019s instinctive understanding of how to make the type of run that instantly takes four players out of the game. That was the Bayern Munich forward\u2019s best quality. It is one of many Sterling qualities.\n\nBecause, in that, Guardiola is just like any other teacher. If an exceptionally gifted one.\n\nHe has just helped Sterling bring out what he already has.\n\n\u201cHis awareness of where defenders were,\u201d Southgate enthused. \u201cHis ability to ride challenges, his vision and desire to get in on goal\u2026 I couldn\u2019t speak highly enough of the way he played.\u201d\n\nThis is why Sterling has started to score so much, and started to be so devastating in open play.\n\nIt is those technical qualities tied together and enhanced by his greater understanding.\n\nIt is what is completing him as a player, what is bringing it all together.\n\nThis is precisely why this stage of a player\u2019s career becomes his prime, because it sees that optimum combination of youthful athleticism with psychological maturity. Few will be capable of a prime like Sterling\u2019s though.\n\n\u201cRaheem\u2019s two performances have been of the highest level,\u201d Southgate added, just as effusively.\n\nAnd it feels he can still go higher. He looks that unstoppable right now.", "description": "For someone as measured with his words as Gareth Southgate, it was strikingly effusive. \u201cI think he\u2019s been almost unstoppable,\u201d the England\u00a0manager said of his top performer, the brilliant Raheem Sterling.
