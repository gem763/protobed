'When I saw the (Spain) game I thought that's him out until the next international break but it's not as bad.'\n\nPaul Pogba will miss the game with a foot injury but Anthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are back in contention despite not having trained much after injury and illness.\n\nLuke Shaw, Phil Jones and Jesse Lingard have also been sidelined but Solskjaer is waiting for news after many of his players returned from international duty\n\n'Of course, I would like to tell you positive news,' said Solskjaer. 'Hopefully we'll see on Sunday who's come through the last two sessions because there are players that just started training on the verge of coming back so I can't really say.'\n\nSolskjaer has challenged his players to take risks against Liverpool and 'make history' by being the one to score the winning goal against Jurgen Klopp's side, as he did as a player at Old Trafford.\n\n'The staff and players know when it's Liverpool coming up,' he added. 'It's a game that's going to be watched by so many, and when you sign for Manchester United this is the first one you look forward to against one of the main rivals.\n\n'It's always been a big fixture and it's a chance for them to \u2013 as I did a couple of times \u2013 to get in the history books because if you can score a winner against Liverpool that's always going to be there with them.\n\nMidfielder Paul Pogba is definitely ruled out of Sunday's match with leaders Liverpool\n\n'Of course, when you lose the majority of your front creativity that we started with you're going to struggle to create as many chances as you'd like.\n\n'Against Newcastle we had 75 per cent possession but you can't carve that opening. The pressing up high has been very good, all the attitude and desire has been very good, but not enough chances created and taken.\n\n'Sometimes that's confidence, that's human nature. You say players missing chances they won't normally miss but it's up to us to keep working and get the ball in between the posts, that goal never moves, that's the easiest bit because you know where it is.\n\n'The culture I'm seeing every day, the attitude of the training, the desire we see in the players here, they want to give absolutely everything for us.\n\n'At times I didn't feel they had the robustness, or the mentality at times. For us, we've been working really hard on the physical robustness and the conditioning. Of course, we've had injuries but maybe that's part of the process here.\n\nStriker Anthony Martial could be in contention to play but lacks match fitness after injury\n\n'I remember when Jurgen came in at Liverpool, if you compare, he also seemed to get a few injuries early on because of the workload and intensity he wanted his team to play with but you don't see that any more. He can play with the same 11 every week and we can get there.\n\n'Liverpool are doing well in the league, that's for sure, but we're looking forward to this game. I think it's the perfect game for our players, the perfect game for our fans. We've had a tough time, a difficult time lately, but I'm sure we'll give them a good game.\n\n'It's business as usual. We're trying to improve the team, we're trying to work towards something but we're heading somewhere we feel but we need results and I expect the players to come out and prove why they're at Man United.\n\n'The mood here is always good. We've come a long way on what you call the culture, the environment. We're working in and it's a positive one.\n\n'But the mood in a football club is always affected by the results. It's been better than expected within here and people that you meet can see what we're trying to do.\n\n'But winning games is the biggest thing in football, that breeds confidence, that's when you get a good mood, and then you can smile. It's a determined bunch of players and a determined club but you can't say we walk around smiling all the time.'", "description": "David de Gea is unlikely to play in Manchester United's clash with bitter rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday but has yet to be completely ruled out.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/10/19876794-0-image-a-8_1571390420330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
