President Barack Obama controversially resisted bipartisan efforts to send lethal military assistance to Ukraine, and Congress has steadily appropriated more money for those programs than the Obama and Trump administrations requested.\n\nBut never before has the White House withheld the entire military allotment for Ukraine until the last days of the fiscal year, as Trump had done, nor has the president ever done so in such an opaque and un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox manner, according to House and Senate aides with knowledge of the process.\n\nAccording to those aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, lawmakers were informed in the spring that the administration intended to start sending money to Ukraine on a rolling basis. But the funds were never transferred \u2014 and by August, congressional appropriators became aware that officials at the Pentagon and the State Department had lost control over the process at the Office of Management and Budget, an executive office run by Mick Mulvaney, who also serves as the president\u2019s acting chief of staff.\n\nFor weeks thereafter, congressional aides said, the OMB announced short-term holds on Ukraine funds. There was never an express reason given except that the administration was conducting a vague \u201cinteragency review\u201d of the funds.\n\nAs the holds continued into September, Democrats introduced two amendments: one to ensure they could roll the current fiscal year\u2019s funds into 2020 and another to hold back $5 billion of the defense budget until Trump releases next year\u2019s military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe government\u2019s fiscal calendar begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cThe administration asked for the money, was given the money and then refused to spend the money until last night . . . with only 18 days left in the fiscal year,\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said during an appropriations committee hearing last week, asking: \u201cWhy the delay?\u201d\n\nPrivately, Democrats are wondering whether the Trump administration was trying to use that money as leverage over the Ukrainian president, hopeful it would spur an investigation of Biden, who is a leading Democratic candidate for president. Biden on Friday suggested there could be a connection.\n\n\u201cIf these reports are true . . . it means he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia \u2014 pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor,\u201d the former vice president said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans echo Trump in suggesting whistleblower complaint is politically motivated\n\nCongressional Republicans have bristled at any criticism of Trump\u2019s management of the Ukraine money, arguing that he had every right to withhold the money while Ukraine was transitioning to a new president, who had up until his election earlier this year been a comic actor with no political experience. They have also alleged that Obama and Biden tried to leverage U.S. aid in their dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHouse Republican leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday: \u201cI just watched our former vice president, in his own words, say he influenced Ukraine to fire somebody based upon aid that America was providing.\u201d McCarthy was referring to comments Biden made at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018, bragging that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, not military aid, unless Ukrainian leaders promptly fired the country\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to me that the last administration didn\u2019t give Ukraine any military aid [and] we actually have an administration that wants to do that,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said, erroneously.\n\nObama resisted approving lethal military aid for Ukraine but distributed about $231 million of the $250 million Congress appropriated for military assistance in fiscal 2016, according to congressional appropriators. That was the first year Congress expressly indicated in its defense bill that some of Ukraine\u2019s military assistance \u2014 $50 million \u2014 was intended for lethal aid.\n\nThough Obama\u2019s stance on lethal aid for Ukraine sparked open protest from senior administration advisers, Democratic and even some Republican aides resisted making a comparison that suggested Trump\u2019s policies were \u201cbetter\u201d for Ukraine, as he and his political allies have.\n\nWhen Congress began appropriating large sums of military aid for Ukraine, some criticized Obama for worrying that providing the lethal assistance Kiev wanted might provoke Russia. But there were legitimate and widespread concerns, aides said, that the fledgling Ukrainian armed forces \u2014 which at that point were more a shifting consortium of militias organized under the country\u2019s interior ministry than a cohesive, traditional military \u2014 would not be able to manage sophisticated weapons systems responsibly.\n\nFurthermore, aides noted, while the Obama administration could have taken bolder steps on military aid, it was clear that the president stood with Ukraine in opposition to Russia \u2014 by his statements, his sanctions and his other efforts to assist the country along with European allies. By comparison, aides said, Trump\u2019s disdain for NATO and embrace of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin have made his policy convictions regarding Ukraine less clear.", "description": "Democrats question whether Trump withheld military aid to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new leader to investigate the former vice president\u2019s son.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UEF6E5W4AAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
