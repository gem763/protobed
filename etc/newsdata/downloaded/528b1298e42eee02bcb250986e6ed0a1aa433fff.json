Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts Democrat, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, urged supporters to contribute to a bail fund for the protesters on FundRazr, which raised nearly $25,000 before being closed.\n\nThe Boston police union has asked Ms. Pressley to withdraw her support for the protesters, saying her fundraising effort \u201cserves only to encourage criminal and disruptive behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe parade, sponsored by Super Happy Fun America, was accused of being homophobic and racist \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called the event a \u201cwhite supremacist parade\u201d \u2014 which organizers disputed.\n\n\u201cOf the twelve speakers on our stage, five were African American, four were women, and three were African American women,\u201d said Super Happy Fun America in an online statement.\n\nThe group also pointed out that its grand marshal was right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, who is openly gay.\n\n\u201cThe only connections to racism and bigotry are in the deluded minds of protesters who all repeat the same mantra against those with whom they disagree,\u201d said the group.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
