I came upon the book the year that I became a father. And I have to admit that it\u2019s an argument about the spiritual consequences of fatherhood and family life that had a profound effect on my own book about my transformation from fatherless American son to Irish-American father. Armed with Eberstadt\u2019s insights, I found I had recovered something of a lost birthright through my own children: the answer to a question deeply wrapped up in identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEver since reading How the West Really Lost God, I have been thinking, talking, and writing about how the shrinking size of families and their brittleness is exercising a powerful influence over our society and politics. Shrinking families means smaller networks of kinship and familial care, which spreads out. Your friends and neighbors have fewer brothers, sisters, and cousins who might serve as role models or a kind of professional network for those who don\u2019t go to top-tier universities.\n\nNow, in her new book, Primal Screams, Eberstadt explores how the unstable, half-formed, and shrinking family explains the urgent cries and screams found in modern identity politics, which emerged just as the sexual revolution was radically transforming the default family life for most Americans.\n\nShe begins with an evocative introduction about the myth of the \u201clone wolf\u201d and our misunderstanding of a fundamentally social creature. She writes:\n\nWhy did anyone believe in the myth of the \u201clone wolf\u201d in the first place? Temple Grandin and Catherine Johnson theorize that people missed the truth initially because most research on wolves was done on animals in captivity. Animals in captivit \u2014 typically separated from their families and surrounded by nonrelated animals in an unnatural setting \u2014 exhibit behaviors markedly dissimilar from those left in nature. These effects range from heightened anxieties and aggression to the development of \u201cstereotypies,\u201d or compulsive repetitive tics, and other self-destructive habits that do not arise in the animal\u2019s native ecosystem. Animals can indeed live in \u201cforced packs\u201d (i.e., among unrelated members of their kind). But it is in forced packs that problems of dominance and hierarchies become accentuated, as animals deprived of familial order must then develop new strategies for competition. Wolves living in families, explain Grandin and Johnson, do not have dominance fights.\n\nShe recounts the multitude of changes in how large pluralities and small majorities of families and children live now, and she says:\n\nMany people, back then and now, have believed in good faith that these familial mutations amount to a net plus for humanity, and that their own lives have been immeasurably enhanced by the freedoms that only the revolution could have brought. This book makes a different case, also in good faith: that these same changes have simultaneously rained down destruction on the natural habitat of the human animal, with radical results that we are only beginning to understand. Its argument is not about individual choices, but about the collective environmental impact of many millions of them, taken over the course of many years.\n\nBy the end of the book, we\u2019ve had similarly suggestive parallels to the breakdown of kin networks among elephants, coyotes, and other social species. The heart of Primal Screams is an argument that humans form their social identity and their sense of self through their relationships to their parents, siblings, and an extended network of cousins, aunts, and uncles. Not only this, but they previously may have found peace and purpose through their religious identity, which puts them, their neighbors, and all of society into a familial relationship with God, the father. In the absence of these character- and self-forming influences, atomized individuals are seeking solace, consolation, and power \u2014 occasionally vindictive power \u2014 in the most abstract form of political identity groups.\n\nThe strength of Eberstadt\u2019s argument comes from the fact that she finds fundamentally authentic the pained, plaintive expressions that are given voice in identity politics. They indicate real feelings of transgression, abandonment, and vulnerability. Though many identity-politics practitioners might find Eberstadt\u2019s analysis condescending \u2014 as when she diagnoses certain novel political gestures as a pediatric tantrum \u2014 this reader found it sympathetic on the whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is, Eberstadt\u2019s analysis points to a process of understanding this phenomenon, not just fearing it. And with understanding perhaps may come social reconciliation and healing. \u201cIt is no disservice to its victims to observe that there might be wider environmental changes that have increased the attraction of gender fluidity and ambiguity,\u201d Eberstadt writes. \u201cLike feminism, the new virtual gender communities offer what in-person communities used to: connections, an audience, a sympathetic ear, and a relational answer to the question Who am I?\u201d Primal Screams takes it for granted that identity politics is, if nothing else, a substitute good for meeting real human needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end, this book has short comments and critiques on its thesis from conservative Rod Dreher, liberal Mark Lilla, and Peter Thiel, the investor and determined futurist. Lilla acknowledges that Eberstadt has helped explain the demand side for identity politics, where he addressed the supply side. But he takes the sexual revolution for granted and complains that conservatives underestimate the innate desire for smaller families that is revealed once the process of embourgeoisement takes place. Thiel credits Eberstadt on the theory but attributes family breakdown and uncertainty not to the pill and the revolution in mores but to the declining economic base for the middle class, one that can only be restored by a full recovery of working toward a better future. Somewhat paradoxically \u2014 though, no less convincingly \u2014 Dreher holds that the recovery of \u201cfamilism\u201d could come through a revived monasticism.\n\nThese reactions are a useful reminder that Eberstadt\u2019s work is not only for conservatives but also for everyone who thinks about contemporary society and finds himself puzzled, worried, or in a foreboding frame of mind about the alarming spike in identity politics as well as suicide, depression, substance abuse, and loneliness.", "description": "The strength of Eberstadt\u2019s argument comes from the fact that she finds fundamentally authentic the pained, plaintive expressions that are given voice in identity politics.", "authors": ["Michael Brendan Dougherty", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "Jack Crowe", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kyle Smith", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mary-eberstadt-primal-scream-b.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
