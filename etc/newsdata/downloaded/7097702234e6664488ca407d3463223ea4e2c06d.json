Dravon Ames, 22, and his fiancee, Iesha Harper, 24, were later identified as the civilians in the video. They were accused of shoplifting at a Family Dollar store.\n\nChief Jeri Williams said Tuesday that two officers had been sent to the Disciplinary Review Board and that the board had recommended a written reprimand for the first officer and a six-week unpaid suspension for the second officer.\n\n(MORE: Phoenix couple in viral-video arrest confront mayor: 'It just makes me sick to my stomach')\n\nWilliams said that she agreed on the discipline decision for the first officer, whom she said had used \"inappropriate\" language, but had also tried to de-escalate the situation. However, Williams said, she had differed with the board on how to discipline the second officer, Chris Meyer.\n\nPHOTO: Dravon Ames and his pregnant fiancee, Iesha Harper, speak at a news conference, June 17, 2019.
