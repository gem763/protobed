I can be grateful and happy to be part of this,' Enrique told Liverpool's official website.\n\n'It's amazing. It has been a very difficult time, probably the most difficult time of my life.\n\n'To [wear] this shirt again, it's my club \u2013 I feel like this is my club \u2013 and to play 90 minutes again with this team is amazing.'\n\nA \u00a3115m radiotherapy machine in Paris helped remove the cancerous cells in Enrique's brain\n\nThe surgery involved entering the brain through the nasal passages to remove the tumour\n\nEnrique, now 33, showed off his superior fitness levels by playing 90minutes of the contest.\n\n'There were a lot of goals, all in the first half. It was really good, I really enjoyed [playing] 90 minutes,' he added.\n\n'I don't even remember the last time I played 90 minutes. I was really happy to see the guys and obviously to play again.\n\n'When you are retired, to come here and play in front of the fans, you have memories and you enjoy it so much. I won't forget this.'", "description": "Former Liverpool defender Jose Enrique has reflected emotionally on the most testing year of his life, which saw him battle a brain tumour before recovering in time to take back to the football pitch.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19657706-0-image-a-24_1570978698698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
