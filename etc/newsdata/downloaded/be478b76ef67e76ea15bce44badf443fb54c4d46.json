The video features Cary Poarch, who claims he was a satellite uplink technician at CNN\u2019s Washington Bureau before, he says, his \u201cdream job\u201d quickly turned into a nightmare due to CNN's blatant bias.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don\u2019t care about them. Let\u2019s just stay very focused on impeachment,\u201d a person identified as Zucker says in the recording. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just pretend, oh, this is going one way.

Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump\u2019s fame when he greenlighted \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nThe duo has famously feuded since Trump\u2019s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage.\n\nZucker is also heard telling staff to call out Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and encouraging CNN on-air personalities to attack Fox News.\n\nFOX NEWS CRUSHES MSNBC, CNN TO WIN 71ST STRAIGHT QUARTER AS 'HANNITY' FINISHES ATOP CABLE NEWS\n\nCNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the clip, Poarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and that he secretly recorded Zucker\u2019s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was \u201cpumping out propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically me wanting the news to be what they used to be -- news -- and not infotainment or a game show or chasing the ratings,\u201d Poarch told O\u2019Keefe. \u201cCNN purports it to be facts first and that\u2019s clearly not the case.\n\n\"I noticed after\u2026 that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was on board the \u2018I hate Trump Train.\u2019\u201d\n\nTRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nThe video also showed someone identified as a CNN media coordinator Nick Neville being secretly recorded.\n\n\u201cJeff Zucker, basically the president of CNN, has a personal vendetta against Trump\u2026 it\u2019s not gonna be positive for Trump.
