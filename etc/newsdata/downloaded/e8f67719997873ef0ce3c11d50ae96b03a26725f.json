The latter is broken and its presence has been inferred from CT scan data.'\n\nShe added: 'This pterosaur lived in the Winton area, 96million years ago in a conifer forest with floodplain and river channels.\n\n'It was inhabited by long necked sauropod dinosaurs, carnivorous theropods, ornithopods and ankylosaurs.'\n\nThese would have included T Rex, which was only recently found to have lived in Australia, and plant-eating armoured giants like Ankylosaurus.\n\nPterosaurs were the first back-boned animals which evolved to be able to fly.\n\nThey emerged about 228million years ago and dominated the skies for some 160million years.\n\nThe remains were found in Winton in Queensland by a farmer named Bob Elliott, who had been going to a local dinosaur museum since he was a child\n\nDuring that time they evolved into a huge range of species, from tiny sparrow-like creatures to giant beasts like Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus, which had a wingspan of up to 30 feet.\n\nThis fossil, which is described in Scientific Reports includes eight limb bones and large portions of the jaws and skull.\n\nThere are also 40 teeth and five vertebrae, making it the most complete pterosaur ever found in Australia.\n\nIt is thought to be a late surviving member of a family of pterodactyls known as Anhanguera. They went extinct at the end of the Cenomanian 94million years ago.\n\nThe fossil record for pterosaurs in Australia is particularly sparse - with only 15 known individuals.\n\nThis specimen was found at the western Queensland site, a famous dinosaur graveyard, by sheep farmer Bob Elliott in early 2017.\n\nIt is five miles from where the skeleton of Savannasaurus elliottorum, a unique species of sauropod, was found in 2005.\n\nWHAT WERE PTEROSAURS? Neither birds nor bats, pterosaurs were reptiles who ruled the skies in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Scientists have long debated where pterosaurs fit on the evolutionary tree. The leading theory today is that pterosaurs, dinosaurs, and crocodiles are closely related and belong to a group known as archosaurs, but this is still unconfirmed. Neither birds nor bats, pterosaurs were reptiles who ruled the skies in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods (artist's impression pictured) Pterosaurs evolved into dozens of species. Some were as large as an F-16 fighter jet, and others as small as a sparrow. They were the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight - not just leaping or gliding, but flapping their wings to generate lift and travel through the air. Pterosaurs had hollow bones, large brains with well-developed optic lobes, and several crests on their bones to which flight muscles attached.\n\nMr Elliott alerted the local Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum, which he had been visiting since childhood.\n\nLab staff and volunteers carried out a thorough excavation of the area, situated on the bank of a small creek.\n\nThe fossils were fragile and widely scattered. The team had to use a combination of dry and wet sieving techniques to get them out of the ground.\n\nMs Pentland, a PhD student, said the skeleton is exceptionally well preserved.\n\nShe added: 'At this time the Winton region was on the southern shores of an inland sea and was globally positioned about where Victoria's southern coastline is today.\n\n'With a total of 30 bones preserved, or 10 per cent of Ferrodraco's skeleton, the number of pterosaur bones reported from Australia has now tripled.'", "description": "The skull and spinal bones of a Ferrodraco lentoni, which translates to 'iron dragon', were discovered by a farmer in Winton, Queensland, and are some of the most complete from Australia.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/16/19260572-0-image-a-31_1570116920466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
