(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have decided to delay a full House vote on whether to open an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, according to Politico.\n\nSeveral centrist Democrats facing difficult reelection bids, as well as powerful committee chairmen, reportedly were opposed to taking the vote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,\u201d Pelosi commented to reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to call bluffs. We\u2019re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe refusal by Democrats to authorize an impeachment inquiry with a full House-wide vote has drawn the ire of Republicans who claim the move is at odds with historical precedent.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you have given no clear indication as to how your impeachment inquiry will proceed \u2014 including whether key historical precedents or basic standards of due process will be observed,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) wrote in a letter to Pelosi in September.\n\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote a letter to Pelosi on October 8, calling the impeachment inquiry \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d without a full House vote.\n\nDemocratic leadership announced the opening of an inquiry after allegations surfaced that President Trump tried to improperly pressure the president of Ukraine to conduct investigations damaging to political rival Joe Biden.", "description": "Several centrist Democrats facing difficult reelection bids, as well as powerful committee chairmen, were reportedly opposed to the move.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
