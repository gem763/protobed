The other major indie awards show, the Film Independent Spirit Awards, takes place in Los Angeles at the end of the season, the day before the Oscars. Its nominations will be announced on Nov. 21.\n\nGotham nominees are selected by juries consisting largely of film critics. Films must meet a variety of fairly nebulous requirements, including being \u201cfilmmaking with a point of view\u201d that is \u201cmade with an economy of means\u201d and is directed and/or produced by a filmmaker born or based in the United States.\n\nLast year, only one of the Gotham Best Feature nominees, \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d went on to receive an Academy Award Best Picture nomination. It lost at the Gothams to \u201cThe Rider.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'The Farewell': How Lulu Wang Cast the Film's Two Biggest Roles\n\nOver the 15 years since the Gotham Awards introduced the Best Feature category, most years have seen one or two of the nominees also land Best Picture noms.
