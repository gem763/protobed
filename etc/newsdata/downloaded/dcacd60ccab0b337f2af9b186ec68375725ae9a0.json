The next highest countries were Indonesia (82 percent), Ukraine (81 percent) and Switzerland (80 percent), according to ICRC. The average rate was 73 percent.\n\nIn a statement, the ICRC called on all countries to prioritize mental health and psychosocial support in situations of violence and armed conflict.\n\n\"Mental health services have for too long been an after-thought in conflict settings. When traumas are invisible, they can be easily overlooked or deprioritized. Yet war has a devastating impact on the mental health and psychosocial well-being of millions. New mental health problems can appear, and pre-existing conditions may resurface. For some the effects will be life-threatening,\" said ICRC President Peter Maurer.\n\n\"Supporting people's mental health can be lifesaving in times of war and violence, just as much as stemming a bleeding wound or having clean water. Hidden wounds are no less dangerous,\" said Maurer.\n\nMore than one out of five people in conflict-affected areas live with some form of mental health condition, from mild depression and anxiety to post-traumatic stress disorder. That is three times more than the general population worldwide suffering from these conditions, according to ICRC.", "description": "Nearly three quarters of all millennials in 15 countries believe mental health needs are as important as water, food and shelter for victims of wars and armed violence, according to a survey commissioned by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9ed2e7a310cf3e97a07a8c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
