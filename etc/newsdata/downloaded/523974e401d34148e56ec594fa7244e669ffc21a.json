Sivan, the chairman of the Indian Space and Research Organisation (ISRO) according to the Press Trust of India news agency. He added: \u201cIt must have been a hard landing.\u201d\n\nISRO officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe space agency said it lost touch with the Vikram lunar lander on Saturday as it made its final approach to the moon\u2019s south pole to deploy a rover to search for signs of water.\n\nIndia's moon landing suffers last-minute communications loss Read more\n\nA successful landing would have made India just the fourth country to land a vessel on the lunar surface, and only the third to operate a robotic rover there.\n\nThe space agency said on Saturday the lander\u2019s descent was normal until 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the lunar surface.\n\nThe roughly $140m mission, known as Chandrayaan-2, was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits that were confirmed by the Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008.\n\nThe latest mission lifted off on 22 July from the Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, an island off the coast of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nAfter its launch, Chandrayaan-2 spent several weeks making its way toward the moon, ultimately entering lunar orbit on 20 August.\n\nThe Vikram lander separated from the mission\u2019s orbiter on Sept. 2 and began a series of braking maneuvers to lower its orbit and ready itself for landing.\n\nOnly three nations \u2014 the United States, the former Soviet Union and China \u2014 have landed a spacecraft on the moon.", "description": "Efforts are underway to establish contact, days after communications were lost during failed landing", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41fa145428dbb183a9ad6b32296c8ba8bbb1eedb/50_14_816_490/master/816.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3440df2273b70e82702e48218f66f22", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
