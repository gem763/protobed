Eliud Kipchoge, already the world record holder in men\u2019s marathons, became the first person ever to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours at an unofficial event in Vienna, Austria, while Brigid Kosgie set a new women\u2019s world record by finishing in 2:14:04 at the Chicago Marathon.\n\nVersions of the same sneaker were worn by the last five runners to break the official men\u2019s marathon record. The trend prompted a \u201cgroup of elite athletes\u201d to raise concerns about the VaporFly\u2019s impact on fair competition, according to The Times, a British outlet.\n\n\"The challenge for the IAAF is to find the right balance in the technical rules between encouraging the development and use of new technologies in athletics and the preservation of the fundamental characteristics of the sport: accessibility, universality and fairness,\u201d the IAAF said in a statement.\n\nNike did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the situation.\n\nWhile Kipchoge wore a prototype version of the Vaporfly during his unprecedented marathon performance, a base version of the sneakers are available for $250 per pair on Nike\u2019s website.
