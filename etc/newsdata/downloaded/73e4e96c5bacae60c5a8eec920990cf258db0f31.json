Justin Amash reacted to John Bolton\u2019s sudden ouster as White House national security adviser Tuesday by saying he \u201cnever should have been hired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope the president\u2019s next national security adviser will focus on securing peace, not expanding war,\u201d the Michigan independent tweeted.\n\nMr. Amash, a former Republican who publicly left the GOP in July, was among the first members of Congress to weigh in after President Trump announced on Twitter earlier Tuesday that Mr. Bolton had resigned.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a series of tweets. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore\u2026.I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton later said that he offered to resign Monday evening and that Mr. Trump told them they would \u201ctalk about it\u201d Tuesday.\n\nA longtime Republican consultant and statesman, Mr. Bolton, 70, was named the president\u2019s national security adviser in March 2018, making him the third person to hold that position during the Trump administration after Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s successor will be announced next week, Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nElected to Congress in 2011, Mr. Amash was the first and only Republican member of the House of Representatives to speak in support of impeaching Mr. Trump prior to leaving the party. Mr. Trump responded at the time by calling Mr. Amash \u201cone of the dumbest [and] most disloyal men in Congress.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
