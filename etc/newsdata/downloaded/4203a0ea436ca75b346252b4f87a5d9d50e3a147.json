Patty Murray caused a disagreement with Republican lawmakers after she said she would introduce an amendment that would bar the Trump administration from implementing its Title X family planning rule, a Senate GOP aide said. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images Congress Senate spending bills thrown into chaos over abortion policy, border wall\n\nSenate appropriators had barely begun work on Tuesday before the process blew up, mired in disagreements over abortion-related \u201cpoison pills,\u201d funding for domestic programs and President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\nThe squabbling reinforces the likelihood that a stopgap spending bill will be needed through mid-November or early December, which House and Senate leaders are mulling as they face another government shutdown at the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats are trying to \u201cwiggle out\u201c of a handshake agreement included in the budget deal signed by Trump last month, which was aimed at ensuring both sides avoid overly partisan policy provisions that could tank appropriations bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call this a troubling sign, and I hope that\u2019s all it is, and we\u2019ll get past this,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said poison pills aren\u2019t the problem. Republicans want to increase funding for the wall by $12 billion, taking as much as $5 billion from domestic programs and pilfering more military construction funds, he said.\n\n\u201cThey know darn well that $12 billion in additional monies for the wall isn\u2019t going to fly with Senate Democrats or the House,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cSo they ought to get serious negotiating now that they\u2019ve shown the president they\u2019re paying a little more fealty to him.\u201c\n\nThe uproar began on Tuesday after Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) informed colleagues that she would introduce an amendment to the fiscal 2020 funding bill for the Department of Health and Human Services barring the Trump administration from implementing its Title X family planning rule, a Senate GOP aide said.\n\nAs a result, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) abruptly canceled a subcommittee markup for the Labor-HHS-Education measure. Any work on the bill will be postponed until both sides can hash out what constitutes a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d the aide said. The full committee is still scheduled to consider the bill on Thursday.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

We could go right to the full committee,\u201d he said.\n\nAppropriators earlier Tuesday had easily approved in subcommittee the $695 billion fiscal 2020 Defense spending bill, which would boost funding for F-35 aircraft.\n\nSenate Democrats are also balking at Republicans\u2019 proposed Labor-HHS-Education allocation, which amounts to a 1 percent increase over the fiscal 2019 level of $180 billion, the Senate GOP aide said. They also want to add a provision to the fiscal 2020 funding measure for the State Department that would nix the so-called Mexico City policy, which bars U.S. foreign aid from flowing to groups that promote or provide abortion.\n\nDemocrats think the proposed allocation for the Department of Homeland Security, which the GOP aide didn\u2019t disclose, is too high. And they\u2019re objecting to a lack of protections in the Defense bill that would prevent Trump from diverting funds to build a border wall.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans have decided to begin the appropriations process with a partisan plan to raid taxpayer dollars from health care programs, education, job training and our military to pay for an ineffective border wall that will do nothing to address the humanitarian crisis on our southern border,\u201d a Senate Democratic aide said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to restrict the president\u2019s ability to steal from funds appropriated for the military and their families. [Senate Appropriations] Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy is hopeful the Committee can get back on track to complete a bipartisan appropriations process.\u201d\n\nLeahy (D-Vt.) plans to offer his own set of fiscal 2020 funding levels for all 12 Senate spending bills, his office confirmed. Schumer said levels set by Republicans were not negotiated with Democratic input.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) indicated that Senate Democrats plan to take action on Thursday when the full Senate Appropriations Committee takes up the fiscal 2020 Defense measure, possibly introducing an amendment that would block the Trump administration from any further border wall cash grabs.\n\n\u201cCongress cannot and should not be silent when the power of the purse is undermined in this way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are we here? Why do we have an Appropriations Committee if this president can ask for money for certain purposes, we appropriate it, and then he ignores us and takes the money for his own political agenda?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am certain my colleagues and I will be ready on Thursday in the full committee to ask \u2026 all the members of the Appropriations Committee to stand up for our own constitutional responsibility,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nAlice Miranda Ollstein, Jennifer Scholtes and Connor O\u2019Brien contributed to this report.", "description": "The squabbling reinforces the likelihood a stopgap spending bill will be needed through mid-November or early December.", "authors": ["Caitlin Emma"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ef/ca/d4bdc86b470d802d6aad1f60acd6/190910-patty-murray-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
