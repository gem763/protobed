REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\nThe application of information technology to firearms has long been resisted in the United States by gun owners and law-enforcement officials who worry they could be hacked, fail at the wrong moment, or invite government control.\n\nBut with the U.S. Army soliciting bids for high-tech battlefield solutions to create the soldier\u2019s rifle of the future, those concerns may quickly become irrelevant. The Army is moving forward regardless.\n\nOne company seeking an Army contract is working on an operating system that could be embedded into the gun, which could have law-enforcement and civilian applications that may reshape the U.S. debate about gun safety.\n\n\u201cYou could accomplish some of the functionality by duct-taping an iPhone to your gun. However what we offer is the world\u2019s first truly embedded operating system,\u201d said Melvic Smith, 41, principal owner of Dimensional Weapons Systems, which bills itself as the first patented blockchain-based firearms company.\n\nThat system could eventually add any number of applications, Smith said, including \u201csmart gun\u201d technology that would only allow the weapon to be fired by a designated shooter\u2019s hand.\n\nSmart guns in theory could prevent children from accidentally firing guns at home, or render stolen guns useless.\n\n\u201cOur team is composed of veterans, law enforcement officers, people that are pro-Second Amendment to begin with,\u201d Smith said, referring to the amendment in the U.S. constitution that grants American citizens the right to bear arms.\n\n\u201cBut we also have engaged with people in the weapons manufacturing industry. They actually love the technology. They\u2019re worried about political backlash.\u201d\n\nOne investor interested in the technology said the Army contracts could \u201ccreate a market overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need disruptive innovation to tackle the gun violence problem,\u201d said Trevor Neilson, chief executive of i(x) investments, which seeks returns on projects with a positive social impact.\n\nWEAPON OF THE FUTURE\n\nThe Army\u2019s specifications are that its Next Generation Squad Weapon - carbines and machine guns - come equipped with a \u201csmart rail,\u201d a communications and power interface between the analog gun and digital technology.\n\nIt has selected three finalists for the contract, to be awarded next year: defense contractor General Dynamics, firearms manufacturer Sig Sauer, and industrial conglomerate Textron.\n\nWhile they battle it out, the Army already is looking toward the next step, seeking partners to provide the IT.\n\nFirst it wants a partner to build a fire-control (FC) system, which will link a soldier\u2019s weapon to other systems to help the operator remain locked on targets, adjusting for atmospheric conditions and range. Historically used for larger systems such as artillery and antiaircraft weapons, prototypes for the carbine and machine gun are due by November 4.\n\nThen, by the end of the year, the Army will look for Innovative Designs & Engineering Assessment (IDEA) prototypes, open-ended products of the imagination that seem only to be limited to what engineers can fit on a chip.\n\nAtlanta, Georgia-based Dimensional Weapons Systems plans to compete for contracts in both categories with its Camelot operating system, which the company says will be hackproof by using blockchain, the decentralized ledger of information used to protect cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nSmith says his technology will record every movement of a gun, from the angles it is pointed at to the exact time of every round fired, providing a digital record that can be used in training or investigations. It could also diagnose the weapon to indicate when it needs to be repaired or retired from service.\n\nNo other companies for the Army\u2019s add-on technology contracts have publicly identified themselves, as companies tend to closely guard their intentions in such a competitive environment, Smith said.\n\nThe Army did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nINNOVATION STALLED\n\nSmart gun technology has convulsed the firearms industry on at least two occasions.\n\nGunmaker Smith & Wesson nearly collapsed due to the wrath of gun owners and the firearms industry when it toyed with the smart gun idea in 2000.\n\nGerman company Armatix was practically put out of the gun business following a 2014 boycott of its short-lived smart gun by U.S. gun rights advocates who said it was unreliable, and to protest a New Jersey law that would have required all gunshops in the state to sell the weapon.\n\nSmart guns have also stalled because of lack of funding. Many investment funds\u2019 covenants prevent them from investing in firearms, while others want to see a working prototype before committing money.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\nAn Army spokesman said there were a \u201clarge number of vendors expressing interest,\u201d ranging from startups to large established government contractors.\n\n\u201cInnovation almost never comes from the people that have been building the same product for 100 years,\u201d Neilson said.\n\n\u201cWhoever gets this right is going to build a massive company.\u201d", "description": "A carbine that can call in an airstrike.
