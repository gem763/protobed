It's shrunk in 2019 while prices have remained relatively stable. Normally, you'd expect prices to contract in order to reflect the absence of earnings. But the opposite has been true \u2014 and the S&P 500 is has rallied roughly 18% year-to-date.\n\nMadan takes a probabilistic, quantitative approach to investing. He looks at the current market cycle, and tries to combine that with the macroeconomic cycle. Once he's got that dialed in, he relies on a few key indicators to help him separate a viable buy/sell signal from the noise.\n\nRead more: The man who wrote the book on how to make 100 times your money with a single stock outlines the core principles of his investing approach \u2014 and shares his 2 top under-the-radar picks\n\nSome of his favorites are: the ratio of copper/gold, global credit spreads, levels of volatility, and the ratio of cyclicals/defensives. These indicators help either confirm or deny potential trends and inflection points that he can use to trade.\n\nThanks to this strategy, when stocks plummeted in the forth-quarter of 2018, he was raking in the profits. When markets were zigging, Madan was zagging. Now he thinks a slight headwind could spell disaster for a frothy market.\n\n\"It wouldn't take much to \u2014 we think \u2014 set off what we think is a bit of capitulation trade, which is a historical precedent that marks every macro-market cycle bottom,\" he said. \"The current environmental conditions are ripe for a Black Swan.\"\n\nToday, his model is tells him the portfolio needs to be tilted towards the bearish side of the spectrum. Here's a list of positions, matched with an exchange-traded fund that can help the average investor follow suit:\n\nIn addition, Madan is short Bitcoin. He views the controversial cryptocurrency as a risk appetite indicator \u2014 and it's plummeted over $4,500 since late June, foreshadowing the move lower in equities.\n\n\"We think that it's an extremely dangerous period right now,\" he concluded. \"It's a very fragile environment.\"", "description": "Shalin Madan, founder and CIO of Bodhi Tree Asset Management, thinks stocks are walking a fine line in a \"very fragile environment.\"", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d0d3a04e3ecba4343484892?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
