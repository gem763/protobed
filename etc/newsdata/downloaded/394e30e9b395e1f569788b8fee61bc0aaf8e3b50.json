And Brad Parscale, who ran Trump\u2019s digital operation in 2016, has been promoted to manage the president\u2019s re-election campaign in 2020.\n\nNot only will control of the White House and Congress be up for grabs next year, but down-ballot races for governor and state legislatures across the U.S. will elect those overseeing the redrawing of state and congressional maps after the next U.S. Census. The redistricting can cement a party\u2019s political power for the coming decade.\n\nWith so much on the line, Priorities USA is gearing up by offering training this year in Georgia, Florida, Colorado, New Hampshire, Ohio and Nevada, focusing on the labor and advocacy groups that form an activist army for Democrats.\n\nDuring a training session Wednesday, Priorities\u2019 Peter Anich walked the group of about 20 people through the placement of a Facebook ad.\n\nAs an example, Anich used Facebook\u2019s ad manager to show how an ad can be shown to a very specific audience. He demonstrated the creation of a hypothetical ad that would be seen on Facebook by people who\u2019ve indicated on the social media site that they work at the Olive Garden restaurant and have an interest in unions - and live in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many things that you could possibly select,\u201d Anich said, adding the social media giant allows ad buyers to also isolate the ad\u2019s audience by gender and whether they\u2019re using Android devices (which tend to cost less than Apple products and are more likely to be used by those with lower incomes).\n\nRobert Cabrera, a digital organizer with Make the Road Nevada, a nonprofit that advocates for working-class people and immigrants, said Wednesday that he\u2019s created some Facebook ads before but wanted to learn how to use other mediums and make sure his online ads reach the right people when they try to promote the state\u2019s presidential nominating caucuses or advocate on an immigration issue.\n\n\u201cIf we do a digital ad, we want to make it as optimized as possible so we\u2019re not just blowing away the little resources that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to cast a broad ad and not reach our target demographic.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As Democrats race to outpace President Donald Trump's aggressive online operation ahead of the 2020 election, the left's largest super PAC touched down in Nevada this week to help local advocacy groups sharpen their internet presence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michelle L.
