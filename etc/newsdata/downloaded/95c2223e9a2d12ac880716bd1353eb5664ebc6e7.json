His was the last black-owned funeral home in the U Street-Florida Avenue corridor in Northwest Washington. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nThe thick, dusty ledgers were scattered about the cluttered office, 18 of them, their pages filled with neat script documenting the deaths of thousands of black Washingtonians over the course of a half-century.\n\nOpen a volume to Page 123 and there is Lawrence Monroe Ryles, 39, a \u201ccolored\u201d postal worker who on Sept. 13, 1947, was \u201crun over by a train.\u201d Turn the pages and find Melvin Bailey, of 1406 Third St. NW, a 6-year-old who died the same year of meningitis. Deep inside another book is Leon Anthony Porter Jr., 18, whose 1990 death occurred after a bullet pierced his skull.\n\nThis compendium of fatal heart attacks, seizures, neck fractures and bullet wounds belongs to the Hall Brothers Funeral Home, whose owner was shutting down the business after nearly 80 years and preparing to sell its Florida Avenue headquarters, a gracious Victorian rowhouse across from the historic Howard Theatre.\n\nThe demise of Hall Brothers \u2014 the last of a half-dozen black-owned funeral parlors along the U Street-Florida Avenue NW corridor \u2014 is another marker in the evolution of a neighborhood once at the core of African American life in Washington.\n\nNow the strip embodies the demographic and economic shifts that have redefined the city, with young professionals, a preponderance of them white, replacing black families, many of which relied on Hall Brothers for \u201csympathetic service\u201d \u2014 as the funeral home once advertised on hand fans that mourners used to cool themselves.\n\nAt its peak, from the 1950s through the 1980s, Hall Brothers performed as many as 140 funerals a year.\n\nIn 2018, it handled four.\n\n\u201cThey moved out or died out,\u201d the owner, Richard Ables, 77, whose uncles founded the funeral home in 1941, said of his lost clientele.\n\nWhen the furnace gave out last fall, Ables didn\u2019t bother calling a repairman.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d he said one afternoon in his second-floor office, every inch a jumble of files, stray tombstones, unused urns, blank death certificates and business cards once given to prospective clients. \u201cIn the event of my death, please notify: Hall Bros. Funeral Home,\u201d the cards read.\n\nAt the entrance, an announcement board, typically lined with dates and times for viewing the dead, was bare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting in here dying with the business,\u201d Ables said, his face framed by a white beard and round tortoiseshell glasses. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe deaths of thousands of Washingtonians are recorded in Hall Brothers files stretching back decades. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Wednesday, Ables sold the property for about $2 million, more than twice the assessed value. That figure was unimaginable 75 years ago. Land records show that his uncle Ocy D. Hall paid $10,000 for the rowhouse near Seventh Street and Florida Avenue.\n\nAbles said he has not met the buyer, negotiating only through a real estate agent, Amy Harasz. Harasz, citing a confidentiality agreement with her client, said in a text message that she was unable to divulge the buyer\u2019s identity, details about the sale or plans for the property.\n\nThe view beyond Hall Brothers\u2019 front stoop \u2014 a new condo tower to the right, another rising to the left, a former Wonder Bread factory turned into a WeWork space down the street \u2014 in no way resembles what Ables remembers from childhood. In those years, he spent afternoons and weekends hanging out at the funeral home, stowing himself in emptycaskets during games of hide and seek with his cousins.\n\nIn later years, they befriended a worker at the Howard Theatre who sneaked them in a side entrance to see the likes of Smokey Robinson and the Temptations, Chuck Brown, James Brown and Aretha Franklin.\n\n\u201cIf we saw a white person, we\u2019d ask, \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 \u201d Ables said of the neighborhood. \u201cNow it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn undated image of African American funeral directors from across the District of Columbia. (Courtesy of Richard Ables)\n\nIn recent months, he sold the hearse, a bright-white 1994 Cadillac. He figured he would scrap the metal \u201cHall Brothers\u201d sign above the entrance \u2014 the \u201cB\u201d fell off long ago \u2014 along with stacks of American Funeral Director magazines, a TV that hadn\u2019t been turned on in years, and his embalming tools.\n\nHe planned to seek guidance from the District\u2019s Board of Funeral Directors about what to do with a dozen or so containers of unclaimed cremated remains, four of which were beneath a stack of files on the floor to the left of his desk. Another, holding the ashes of Yvonne C. Henley, who died in 1988, was on his office mantel.\n\n\u201cHer daughter came down from New York to order it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d\n\nAbles seemed most concerned about those 18 ledger books scattered around his office, and preserving a record of people such as Lonnie Burton, a \u201claborer\u201d who died of \u201ccongestive heart failure\u201d May 7, 1947; Sarah Lee Rush, 37, whose 1981 death occurred after a \u201cgun shot wound of the chest\u201d; and Clyde Gossett, 29, a \u201ccounselor\u201d who died of AIDS eight years later.\n\n\u201cAll of this should go to a museum or somewhere,\u201d Ables said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where to send it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAs Hall Brothers\u2019 phone rang less frequently over the years, Ables was torn over whether to close the business that his uncles had started after migrating from Mississippi in the 1930s. On Sundays, he liked to drive to a Maryland cemetery to contemplate the future at the graves where his mother, father, brother, aunt and Uncle Ocy are buried.\n\nIn his wallet, as always, he carried his parents\u2019 newspaper death notices and his father\u2019s Social Security card \u2014 documentation that makes him feel connected to them no matter the number of years since their passing.\n\n\u201cDo what you gotta do,\u201d he could hear them telling him, he said.\n\nWhen he took over Hall Brothers in the late 1990s, Ables had promised to \u201ckeep it going as long as I could and pass it on.\u201d But no one in the family was interested. Not his children. Not his cousins, nieces or nephews.\n\nMacy Hall Jr., 76, the founder\u2019s son, had gone to medical school, an interest inspired during childhood when he accompanied his father on funeral calls.\n\n\u201cI was 5 and I\u2019d ask him, \u2018Why are they dying?\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018Because their heart stopped,\u2019 \u201d Hall Jr. said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say I wanted to become a doctor to keep those hearts from stopping.\u201d\n\nMacy Hall Jr. said he loved hanging out at Hall Brothers as a child. Ocy Hall, his favorite uncle, lived upstairs. On Halloween, trick-or-treaters ringing the bell at Hall Brothers could find themselves greeted at the front door by youngsters popping out of a coffin.\n\nEveryone had chores. Macy Jr. polished the brass rails at Hall Brothers\u2019 entrance and, when he got his driver\u2019s license, drove the hearse during funerals. \u201cIt gave me a sense of power and control that traffic would stop to let the hearse through,\u201d he said.\n\nHe became a plastic surgeon instead of a funeral director because \u201cthe business wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d he said, lapsing into mortician shtick. \u201cToo dead.\u201d\n\nOcy and Macy Hall Sr. started their enterprise at a time when blacks \u2014 often shut out of medicine and other professions \u2014 found prosperity and prestige in mortuary science.\n\nBy the 1920s, after African Americans had settled in neighborhoods such as Shaw and Ledroit Park, black-owned funeral parlors opened along the area\u2019s main thoroughfares. The Jarvis Funeral Home was at 14th and U streets from 1920 until it shut down in 1985. Frazier\u2019s was at Florida and Rhode Island avenues from 1929 until 2008, after which a developer turned the building into condominiums.\n\nAfter the 1968 riots, which started at 14th and U streets, McGuire Funeral Service moved north from Shaw to Georgia Avenue NW. R.N. Horton\u2019s relocated from 13th and U streets to Kennedy Street NW, where it still operates, always looking for ways to draw new customers, including by recently purchasing a $100,000 replica of a 1932 hearse.\n\n\u201cThis kind of thing makes your phone ring,\u201d said Randolph Horton, the son of the business\u2019s founder, Rufus, who himself attracted patrons by leading funerals in a tuxedo and wide-brimmed hat.\n\n\n\nHall Brothers Funeral Home has been closed and the building sold. The exterior was photographed June 26. New construction across the street is part of gradual change that spelled the end for the business. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nHall Brothers never went anywhere. Ocy and Macy eventually turned the business over to William Ables, Richard\u2019s brother. When William died of a heart attack in 1998, Richard arranged his brother\u2019s funeral and then took over.\n\nHe tried to draw new clientele, placing ads catering to Hispanics, Ethiopians and Indians, but there was little, if any, response.\n\nSince 2000, Hall Brothers presided over 446 funerals, or about a quarter of the 1,816 it conducted from 1980 to 1999.\n\n\u201cWe got stuck in time,\u201d Ables said.\n\nAs funeral director, he orchestrated the rituals of mourning, helping families pick caskets, shrouds and plots. He especially enjoyed embalming, when, alone with a corpse in a prep room, his radio tuned to classical music, he used his tools to \u201cput that smile back on their face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an art, man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing an art.\u201d\n\nAs he worked, he often found himself thinking about how little he knew about his own family\u2019s history and hoped that the person before him had \u201cshared their story,\u201d the names of their ancestors and the details of how they had lived.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, all that they know is going into the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nHis final \u201ccase,\u201d as he likes to refer to the dead, was Fannie Lomax, 82, of Northeast Washington, a mother of five and grandmother of eight, who died March 16. After her funeral, the only one he performed this year, Ables made sure to log her address, religion, date of birth, date of death and burial site.\n\nAs always, he said, he considered it not just his obligation to record the spare details of a life at its end, but also his privilege \u201cto leave behind a legacy for folks to reflect on.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAs Ables was negotiating with a potential buyer earlier this year, his assistant, Derrick McArthur, got an idea.\n\nPerhaps the D.C. Public Library would want to preserve Hall Brothers\u2019 registries of the dead. A few emails and phone calls later, and Derek Gray, a library archivist, went to Hall Brothers to inspect the records.\n\n\u201cA gem for genealogists,\u201d Gray declared after looking through the books.\n\nIn addition to the registries, the library system took assorted memorabilia \u2014 samples of the hand fans, funeral programs and the brass-coated \u201cHall Brothers\u201d name plate that was in the side window of its hearse.\n\nWhen Ables started telling stories about the neighborhood and performers he saw at the Howard Theatre, Gray said, \u201cWe knew we needed to pull out a tape recorder.\u201d\n\nThe archivist hopes Ables will make himself available for an oral history, something he may have time for in retirement, when he\u2019s not listening to John Coltrane or Miles Davis and contemplating the future, including, as it happens, his own burial.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to be buried in a suit,\u201d Ables said on a recent afternoon, relaxing in Hall Brothers\u2019 parlor. \u201cI want a nice pair of silk pajamas and a smoking jacket. A jazz trio playing at the service. A solid wood mahogany casket.\n\n\u201cSomething that will last,\u201d he said.", "description": "As Hall Brothers shuts down after nearly 80 years, the owner seeks to preserve burial records that document a disappearing black Washington", "authors": ["Paul Schwartzman", "Reporter Specializing In Political Profiles", "Narratives About Life", "Death", "Everything In Between", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b0BOLHphTfwxqsweYj-PN4LShTc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y5JFVRU43AI6TA7DIX663DUNFY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
