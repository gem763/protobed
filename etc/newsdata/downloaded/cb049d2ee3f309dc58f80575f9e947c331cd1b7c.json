A few years ago, as the Department of Labor worked to finalize its \u201cfiduciary rule\u201d for retirement accounts, it often seemed like proponents and opponents of the rule were speaking a different language and drawing from a completely distinct set of facts. It should be no surprise then that, with finalization of the SEC\u2019s new \u201cRegulation Best Interest,\u201d it seems again as though boosters and critics are describing completely different regulations.\n\nThe financial-services industry argues that the regulation is a step forward in protecting consumers, while breathing a sigh of relief at its overall scope. Consumer advocates have been arguing that the rule maintains the status quo and is less than useless because it will give investors a false sense of advisors\u2019 obligations to them.", "description": "The SEC has not gone as far as many would like, but it\u2019s taken some important steps.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt82be987fd176accb/5cf5932bd8bbe50306d29a7c/Saving_1x1.svg", "published_at": "2019-07-04"}
