UK prime minister Boris Johnson tried to convince MPs to support his agreement he made with the EU and MPs debated the proposal. Johnson said in a speech \"now is the time to get this thing done,\" adding that delaying past the Brexit deadline of 31 October would be \"corrosive.\"\n\nJohnson\u2019s cabinet threatened to postpone a vote on a revised deal if politicians voted to drag out Britain\u2019s exit from the 27-nation bloc, again. However, MPs voted 322 to 306 to back a motion designed to rule out a no-deal exit \u2014 which is what will happen if politicians do not agree to Johnson\u2019s new deal with the EU. It was tabled by independent MP Sir Oliver Letwin, which \"withholds approval\u201d for Johnson's Brexit deal until legislation implementing it has been passed.\n\nREAD MORE: Snap poll: Most UK firms push MPs to support Boris Johnson's Brexit deal\n\nThe UK prime minister will have to go to the EU and ask for an extension beyond the 31 October deadline. If he was successful in doing this, it would be the second extension the EU has granted the UK.\n\nJohnson said he will press on \"undaunted\" with his Brexit strategy while the EU said it was up to the UK to \"inform it of the next steps.\" Meanwhile, MPs signalled that a vote on Johnson\u2019s revised Brexit agreement could now take place on Monday \u2014 however, this is up to the Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nBusinesses are not happy\n\nDemonstrators hold placards and EU and Union flags as they take part in a march by the People's Vote organisation in central London on October 19, 2019, calling for a final say in a second referendum on Brexit.

The paralysis of the current situation prevents directors from moving forward with plans for investment and growth. By no means is there unanimity among business leaders on the path ahead, but avoiding a disorderly exit at the end of the month comes out clearly as a pressing priority,\u201d said Jonathan Geldart, Director General of the Institute of Directors.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest independent financial advisors \u2014 said: \u201cOne of the most important days in British political history became something of a damp squib as the Letwin Amendment rendered the Meaningful Vote meaningless.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of a no-deal Brexit is now becoming increasingly likely. As such, the government is said to be upping its no-deal preparations and is set to introduce legislation needed for the UK to leave the EU on 31 October.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister is clear that he will not negotiate a delay and says that the law doesn\u2019t compel him to do so. He will tell EU leaders there should be no delays and that they should reject Parliament\u2019s letter asking for a delay.\"\n\nThe national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Mike Cherry said: \u201cMany small business owners will groan with frustration at the continued uncertainty over a Brexit deal. But the important thing now is for MPs to focus next week on finding a way forward once and for all, which avoids leaving without a deal on 31 October and secures a transition period.\n\n\u201cThe prolonged period of uncertainty caused by the political stalemate has left small firms in limbo, with investment plans on hold and confidence low. This can\u2019t drag on. The Government and Parliament must now work together to ensure there is a deal which secures sufficient time for small businesses to adapt to the longer-term arrangements with the EU.\u201d", "description": "MPs voted 322 to 306 to back a motion designed to rule out a no-deal exit.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QQxMXeM7q2bGkgwndTEBKQ--~B/aD00OTEyO3c9NzM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c7180060-f282-11e9-8dec-5aeb4b5e9830", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
