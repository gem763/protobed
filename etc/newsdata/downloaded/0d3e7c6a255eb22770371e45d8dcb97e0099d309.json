Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) repeatedly denied on Sunday that President Donald Trump was serious about his public call for China to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, despite the fact that he proposed the idea on camera.\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Jordan dodged multiple questions over whether it is appropriate for the president to seek assistance from a foreign government in probing his political rival, claiming it was just the media being \u201call spun up\u201d about it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he really meant go investigate,\u201d he told host George Stephanopoulos. \u201cDo you think China is going to investigate him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if China is going to investigate him,\u201d Stephanopoulos replied. \u201cI know the president asked China to investigate him.\u201d\n\nThough there is now an escalating impeachment inquiry into the president \u2015 fueled by evidence that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to investigate Biden and his son over unsubstantiated corruption allegations \u2015 Jordan asserted that he knows China won\u2019t take part.\n\nStephanopoulos again pushed the congressman to answer the question.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you answer yes or no, do you think it\u2019s appropriate?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he did,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan offers indirect response to @gstephanopoulos if it's appropriate for Trump to comment for China to investigate Bidens: \"You would think after...a few years of following this president you'd sort of understand how this guy communicates.\" https://t.co/OYLvesRkYq pic.twitter.com/y48y8lBJOe \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 6, 2019\n\nAs Trump left the White House on Thursday on his way to Florida, he told reporters, \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThere was no sign he was joking, and Trump has made no remarks indicating it was not a genuine suggestion.\n\nThere remains no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens, though Trump allies like Jordan have continued to support the president despite the release of a whistleblower complaint that has roiled the White House.\n\nThe report, which was filed by a member of the intelligence community in August, cites Trump\u2019s contact with Ukraine as a proof he \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower\u2019s attorney, confirmed on Twitter that he and his legal team are representing \u201cmultiple whistleblowers in connection\u201d with the complaint.", "description": "The GOP congressman repeatedly claimed that the president wasn't serious when he said China should investigate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a154f2100005903324679.jpeg?cache=uwvsd6zuli&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
