PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Carli Lloyd scored twice and the U.S. national team extended its winning streak to 16 games with a 3-0 exhibition victory over Portugal on Tuesday night.\n\nIt was Jill Ellis\u2019 105th victory as the U.S. coach, tying her with Tony DiCicco\u2019s record from 1994-1999. Ellis, now 105-7-18, plans to step down in October following the team\u2019s final two victory tour matches.\n\nThe match at Allianz Field was the third of a five-city tour celebrating the U.S. team\u2019s World Cup victory this summer in France. It was the team\u2019s second straight World Cup title and fourth overall.\n\nThe Americans also defeated Portugal 4-0 last Thursday at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field before 49,504 fans, the largest ever for a stand-alone friendly game for the U.S. women.\n\nThe Americans have won all nine of their meetings with Portugal and have never allowed a goal.\n\nLloyd scored in the 22nd minute and converted a penalty kick some 10 minutes later. The 37-year-old has 117 career goals and leads the team with 12 this year alone.\n\nLloyd, a two-time FIFA World Player of the Year, grabbed headlines recently when she kicked a 55-yard field goal at the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 training camp.\n\nLindsey Horan scored in 93rd minute on a header off a corner kick from Christen Press, who has a team-best 11 assists this year.\n\nAlex Morgan and Rose Lavelle were both out because of concussion protocol. Lloyd started up top for the United States for the second straight game while Jessica McDonald took the place of Megan Rapinoe, who has an Achilles injury. Kelley O\u2019Hara was sidelined by an ankle injury.\n\nDefender Ali Krieger and her fianc\u00e9e, goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris, were not with the team because of a family emergency.\n\nNorth Carolina Courage forward Kristen Hamilton made her debut for the U.S. in the 76th minute, coming in as a sub for McDonald.\n\nA sellout crowd of 19,600 watched the team\u2019s first match at Allianz Field, the home of Major League Soccer\u2019s Minnesota United, which opened earlier this year.\n\nThe victory tour continues next month with games against South Korea on Oct. 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Oct. 6 in Chicago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carli Lloyd scored twice and the U.S. national team extended its winning streak to 16 games with a 3-0 exhibition victory over Portugal on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/portugal_us_soccer_56112_c0-141-3365-2102_s1770x1032.jpg?f449e200c958c942119840e086e472e9df76b88e"}
