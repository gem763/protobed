Border personnel said they checked her passport in their system and found that she had not applied for an Indian visa.\n\nRather than return Malik to Nepal, they arrested her and charged her with violating India\u2019s visa and passport statutes. Her trial began this week.\n\nAD\n\nMalik sounds \u201cvery anxious\u201d and \u201cdesperate,\u201d said her brother Nauman Malik, who also lives in California. He was able to speak to her briefly on Tuesday for the first time since her detention.\n\nAD\n\nMalik forgot her passport at her hotel in Kathmandu, her brother said. He arranged to have it delivered to her lawyer in India in August.\n\nMalik was born in Pakistan and immigrated to the United States as a teenager. She became an American citizen in 1992, her brother said. She worked in information technology until four years ago, when she left her job to care for her mother who had been diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in New Delhi referred queries about the case to the State Department in Washington.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Uttarakhand, India,\u201d said a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in adherence with internal policy. \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad, and are monitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nU.S. embassy officials have visited Malik three times, according to her brother, to check on her welfare.\n\nIndia\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs declined to respond to questions about Malik\u2019s situation, including whether her birth in Pakistan was a factor in her case.\n\nMalik\u2019s detention appears highly unusual. The State Department declined to say whether there were previous cases where Americans had been jailed after arriving at the Indian border without a passport or visa.\n\nAD\n\nAll Americans must apply for a visa before arriving in India. On its website, the State Department says Americans traveling to India without a valid passport and visa \u201cmay be denied admission\u201d to the country.\n\nChandra Shekhar Kargeti, one of Malik\u2019s lawyers in India, said he could not recall a similar case. His previous clients charged with violations of India\u2019s visa and passport laws were Pakistani citizens \u2014 most of them shepherds \u2014 who had unwittingly crossed the border into India.\n\nAD\n\nAshok Kumar, a senior police official in the state of Uttarakhand, said that he, too, was unaware of a case comparable to Malik\u2019s but that authorities had acted properly. \u201cIf you do not have a valid travel document you will be arrested under the Passports Act and the Foreigners Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court of law will now decide.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA Bollywood aficionado who hoped to launch a singing career, Malik had spent time in India in the past. She completed a three-month course at the Asian Academy of Film and Television outside Delhi, an official at the school confirmed.\n\nOn her latest trip abroad, Malik traveled to Indonesia and Nepal before attempting to visit India. On her Facebook page, she posted photos of a sunset in Bali and waterfalls near the Nepali city of Pokhara.\n\nMalik\u2019s brother Nauman Malik said his sister suffers from a herniated disk and has complained of the cold in the jail, which is located high in the foothills of the Himalayas. He recently took a leave of absence from his job as a software product manager to work full time on securing her release. He has started an online petition and contacted numerous senior government officials in the United States and India seeking their help, so far to no avail, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCourts have rejected Malik\u2019s application for bail, and her lawyer said the trial could continue until the end of November. If convicted, she faces a maximum of five years in prison.\n\nFor Nauman Malik, the thought of his sister spending more time in jail is unbearable. \u201cShe made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not a criminal.\u201d\n\nTania Dutta contributed to this report.
