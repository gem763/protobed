Channel 4 has not yet confirmed an air date.\n\nRodrigo (pictured) has experienced a number of complications with his own cosmetic procedures, including struggling to breathe through his nose.\n\nSpeaking around the time that the concept was announced, Channel 4 director Ian Katz, claimed their aim is to 'make entertaining, mischievous and innovative shows about the big issues and arguments in Britain today.'\n\nHowever a number of people have spoken publicly against the format.\n\nOne doctor who was due to take part in the show claimed he turned down the offer because it seemed unethical.\n\nMeanwhile Flack became embroiled in a Twitter spat with fellow TV star Jameela Jamil after announcing her participation.\n\nJameela compared the show to sci-fi drama Black Mirror as she argued that it preys on people's insecurities.\n\nCaroline Flack (pictured) is due to present the Channel 4 show. She was forced to defend herself after she was attacked on Twitter by Jameela Jamil\n\nCaroline responded: 'As you know self image is a complicated, sensitive and personal subject.\n\n'At the heart of this show are people not contestants who have sought help to want to better them selves in their own eyes. Their stories deserve to be told and not ridiculed online.'\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson told Mail Online: 'Cosmetic surgery has become an increasingly mainstream choice in Britain. The Surjury seeks to explore why so many people feel the need to change their bodies, and whether surgery actually makes them happier.\n\n'All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord. This new series allows them to consult with surgical teams and then to discuss their reasons for wanting it with a panel of their peers. If their peers support their decision they will undergo the procedure of their choice subject to the usual surgical checks and consent processes.\n\n'The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities of cosmetic surgery.\n\n'Duty of care to contributors is of paramount importance and all will be independently assessed by the clinic who will carry out their procedure. They will be psychologically assessed and supported regarding their involvement in the programme.'", "description": "Rodrigo Alves from Brazil, who is best known as the Human Ken Doll, has slammed Channel 4's The Surjery.
