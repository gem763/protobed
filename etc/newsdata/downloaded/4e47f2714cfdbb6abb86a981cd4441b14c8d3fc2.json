We\u2019ve undertaken a lot of work on heat management. We recognise that the road events are those that need to be carefully monitored. We have more medical supervision, more water available. There\u2019s no plan to cancel.\u201d\n\nWriting on social media, the British distance runner Helen Davies, who competed in the 2010 Commonwealth Games marathon in Delhi in 30C and 90% humidity, said it was \u201cludicrous, not to mention dangerous and potentially fatal\u201d to run in such conditions. Writing of her experience, she said: \u201cIn the last 5km I was hallucinating and felt like I was cold, despite being the complete opposite, very scary. I would be very worried if I was heading into that marathon.\u201d\n\nCoe conceded that the race, in which Tish Jones and Charlotte Purdue will compete for Britain, would be tough but refused to be drawn on whether it would turn into a farce.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on that, but, of course, I want as many people to finish as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cOur medical teams are going to be very good. The heat is actually not the big issue, the issue is humidity, that is the real challenge. We have extra precautions, we do have extra things out on the course. We have more medical supervision, more water available but, yes, it is going to be tough.\u201d\n\nThe IAAF also announced it had a budget deficit of $20m (\u00a316m) but Coe insisted a new deal with the Wanda Sports Group in China made him optimistic about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s has been a tough four years, there is no point being naive or coy about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the next four years to be the fun bit. We have to grow the sport.\n\n\u201cWe know we have to reach beyond the beltway of athletics fans. We need to form partnerships at every level. We have to place the sport as a service provider for government agendas and get more people active and physically engaged.\u201d", "description": "The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, has said extra medical staff, ice baths and water will be brought in for the women\u2019s marathon amid growing concerns about extreme conditions", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae52cff26c1c2d75a13005d1c12ca2a8c072221d/3_128_6035_3623/master/6035.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42fc4f76f6d940a97b8234198ef58dbc", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
