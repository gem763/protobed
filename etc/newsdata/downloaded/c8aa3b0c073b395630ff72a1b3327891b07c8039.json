You also (hopefully) understood that you weren't really buying a performance-oriented Camry, per se, but simply the most powerful Camry. There is a difference. The 2020 Camry TRD, however, is the first of Toyota's long-standing bread-and-butter mid-size sedans that one could actually construe as \"sporty.\"\n\nSince its introduction in 1983, the closest the Camry has ever come to letting its hair down was a dealer-installed bolt-on supercharger kit for the V-6 model, sold by Toyota's in-house performance arm, Toyota Racing Development, better known as TRD. The Camry's existence was otherwise vanilla, delivering customers reliable, inoffensive transportation and nothing more while riding a wave of ubiquity to a reputation for being automotive wallpaper. There is plenty of \"more\" in the Camry TRD, however, as it represents a near-total performance makeover of the current model, itself the most driver-focused version ever. We even sampled it at the unlikeliest venue for a Camry: Texas Motor Speedway.\n\nPhoto credit: Toyota More\n\nMo' Camry, Mo' TRD\n\nThe TRD's front brake rotors are 0.9 inch larger in diameter than those on the next-sportiest Camry, the XSE V-6 model and are squeezed by two-piston calipers instead of single-piston units. Toyota also has retuned the feel of the brake pedal. Stiffer springs and stiffer, larger-diameter anti-roll bars (27.0 millimeters thick versus 25.4 millimeters on the XSE) increase the Camry's resistance to body roll by 44 percent in front and 67 percent in the rear. The suspension changes are matched by stiffer underbody braces and a V-brace behind the rear seats (as a result, those seats cannot fold as they do on the regular Camry). TRD also fits dampers with internal return springs and revised valving compared with the units on lesser Camrys.\n\nIf this sounds a bit ridiculous in the context of a Camry, we're not done yet. Just look at the matte-black, TRD-specific 19-inch wheels. Not only do they look tough, each one is 3.1 pounds lighter and half an inch wider than the XSE's 19-inch rollers; Toyota also wraps them with Bridgestone Potenza summer tires. And then there is the fast-and-furious body kit, which is includes gloss-black lower-body add-ons\u2014complete with a red pinstripe\u2014and a rear wing supported by two struts.\n\nPhoto credit: Toyota More", "description": "We won't even make a beige joke\u2014this is one seriously sporty Toyota Camry.", "authors": ["Alexander Stoklosa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_s0erCPsO8y7kRnHVKcNUQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/0ebc7c71c696d5b710dbef851797e9d4", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
