People can expect to get their full allocation in 8 or 9 years out of 10.\"\n\nBy contrast, the majority of irrigators in the southern MDB were adopting a \"hand to mouth\" approach to buying water with the hope prices will decline, Mr Cranna said.\n\nHorticultural plantings are also rising in the NSW Northern Rivers region stretching from Grafton along the coast to the Queensland border, incorporating the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed Rivers.\n\nThe region has attracted a wide range of crops including sugar cane and permanent plantings like macadamia, avocados, bananas and blueberries, said Colliers International NSW valuation director John Harrison.\n\n\"Reliable and high annual rainfall - averaging between 1000 - 2000 millimetres - means there is limited trading activity for water entitlements,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToowoomba-based valuation director Jason Osborn said there had been a rapid re-adjustment in land use in southern coastal Queensland in the last two to three years.\n\n\"We've seen an expansion of tree crops with macadamia and avocados often being established on ex-sugar cane land,\" Mr Osborn said.\n\n\n\nAmid a greater understanding of water reliability, he said areas like Mundubbera, Childers, Bundaberg and the Atherton Tablelands were attracting wide national and international interst,\n\n\"I\u2019m talking investments by large corporations into horticulture properties,\" Mr Osborn said.\n\nThere was also rising interest and investment in high value crops in Northern Australia, valuations director Shaun Hendy said.\n\n\"This region [above the Tropic of Capricorn] accounts for 40 per cent of Australia's land mass, 50-60 per cent of its surface water run-off, but has only 8 per cent of the developed irrigation industry,\" he said.\n\n\"Therefore the potential to increase Australia\u2019s horticultural output through Northern Australia is enormous.\"\n\nHe said established growers in southern markets were investigating opportunities in Northern Australia because combined land, water and holding costs to crop maturity were much lower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are also seeing local government authorities supportive of growth in horticulture, as it will diversify their economies,\" he said.\n\nColliers national agribusiness director Rawdon Briggs said the value of macadamia orchards in the Burnett region of southern Queensland had doubled in value in the past four years to $50,000 per hectare for land and water, alongside a five-fold increase in production.\n\n\"That's why the Mary Valley in Queensland and the Clarence Valley in NSW (where prices per hectare average $26 - $30,000) are areas of focus for institutions and large family operations looking to expand,\" Mr Briggs said.", "description": "Horticultural investment is flowing into Tasmania and Australia's north as the drought bites in traditional food cropping regions, says Colliers International.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5806%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_10%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a1f45b08d55c1f39a2b24d4f3fc78545e54d3558", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
