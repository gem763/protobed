(AP) - Piles of steel sit at one end of the property, waiting to be lifted into place. Workers were going in all directions, some pounding nails into wood, others ready to pour concrete, others driving heavy equipment over piles of dirt.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s a construction site.\n\nBefore long, Inter Miami will call it home.\n\n\u201cOrganized chaos,\u201d Inter Miami sporting director Paul McDonough said as he took a look around the site of the now-demolished Lockhart Stadium where work on a new complex is happening 12 hours a day, seven days a week. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\nThese are hectic times for McDonough and Inter Miami, the team headlined by soccer icon David Beckham that will embark on its inaugural MLS season starting early in 2020. The team doesn\u2019t have a coach yet. Or players. Or a schedule. Or even the first blade of grass for its new field.\n\nOver the next few weeks, all those issues - and countless others - will be addressed. Construction is on schedule, with all signals pointing toward everything being ready for the team\u2019s first home match that\u2019s likely to come in March.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t do much to help McDonough\u2019s sleep cycle.\n\n\u201cThis takes up a ton of time and everything keeps me up at night,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK. We\u2019re just on an accelerated timeline. There\u2019s so much stuff going on. But this is expansion. It\u2019s awesome. Everything we\u2019re doing here, we\u2019re trying to do it right.\u201d\n\nAt any given time, there are about 225 workers on the job site - the whereabouts of all of them tracked with an app that gets data from a chip attached to the back of their hard hats. If there\u2019s lightning in the area, work gets halted for 30 minutes until the cell passes. And that\u2019s a big deal, because even with next season still months away every minute counts.\n\nNothing is ready, yet - but it will be.\n\n\u201cThe way it was built out, we\u2019re thinking of the athlete first from the minute they walk in,\u201d said Jacklyne Ramos, the team\u2019s vice president of communications as she stood inside what will be the building containing the locker room and other key spaces for the team. \u201cThe main stadium, that\u2019s for the games. Where we are now, this is where they\u2019ll live.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press got a tour on Monday of what will be Inter Miami\u2019s inaugural home. The shell of the team\u2019s headquarters - locker rooms, equipment room, dining area, coach\u2019s office, what will become the sports performance lab, the academy workout facilities and more - is coming together. Every detail has been thought of; the walk from the players\u2019 parking lot to the building will be short, the training room will be small (\u201cI don\u2019t want them comfortable in there,\u201d McDonough said), and an area will be built just off the outside wall of the locker room to air out cleats after training sessions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never be in the building,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cBoots can stink.\u201d\n\nBeckham spent about five years trying to get MLS back in South Florida, and after many sites were considered - there\u2019s still plans for the team to eventually play in another stadium that Beckham and his partner Jorge Mas want built in Miami - they settled on the former Lockhart site. Lockhart is where the MLS\u2019 Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, eventually folding because of poor attendance.\n\nInter Miami plans to play in Fort Lauderdale until the Miami stadium is complete, but what they\u2019re building at the Lockhart site is permanent; the training complex will remain the facility for Inter Miami\u2019s MLS, USL League One and academy teams.\n\nThe centerpiece of everything is the 18,000-seat stadium, and parts of what will become the field are already largely marked off. Drainage was installed first, followed by four inches of rock for a base. From there, sprinklers go into place and four thin pieces of wood are set in place to mark where the goalposts will go. About a foot of soil will be added in the coming weeks, watered and compacted and graded. Sod is scheduled to go in Nov. 14; from there, it\u2019ll be protected and fenced off and finally, what now seems like an oversized sand pit right now will look like a place to play soccer.\n\nBehind that are more fields, including a turf one that can be used for high school football and other events. The other half-dozen grass fields will be for training and the team\u2019s affiliate clubs.\n\nA coach will be hired soon. A roster is coming. There are plans for a soft opening a few weeks before the season and then, when the first match is played, all the mess and chaos will be forgotten.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready for this. I\u2019m still not,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cI\u2019m learning as we go. Conduits, positioning of poles, there\u2019s so many things that you don\u2019t realize until you live it. But that\u2019s what it takes and we\u2019re getting it done.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Piles of steel sit at one end of the property, waiting to be lifted into place.
