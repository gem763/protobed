In an article about perfume diffusers (I know, I know), we described a particularly well presented one as \u201ca great one for gifting\u201d.\n\nI can\u2019t explain why this grates on me, and why I think it would be better to write \u201ca great one for a present\u201d. Some nouns can be turned into verbs quite happily: you can chair a meeting, fool around and then sleep soundly. But some newer verbings meet customer resistance. I\u2019m not sure about \u201cto holiday\u201d or \u201cto lunch\u201d and I draw the line at \u201cto medal\u201d.\n\nMind you, if we disallow \u201cgift\u201d as a verb, it will make sports reporting difficult. Hardly any match report is complete without one team \u201cgifting\u201d the ball to their opponents.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLast week, for example, we wrote: \u201cThere will be none of the inconsistency or errors that saw Australia gift multiple points to the Welsh in their encounter last month.\u201d All it means is \u201cgive away\u201d, but with the implied metaphor of tying a bow round it and presenting it as a gift.\n\nThat report also used \u201cmultiple\u201d where my preference would be \u201cseveral\u201d. I would say the match \u201csaw Australia give away several points to the Welsh\u201d.\n\nWe used \u201cmultiple\u201d several times in this sense last week; although we used \u201cseveral\u201d about three times as often. As with \u201cgift\u201d, I find it hard to explain why I find \u201cmultiple\u201d an ugly word, although in its case it may be the flavour of court reporting \u2013 \u201cmultiple stab wounds\u201d \u2013 and the doomed attempt to avoid sounding vague.\n\nBut the point is that many readers dislike these uses. They may be irrational to do so, but it is only in our self-interest to avoid them.\n\nTech jargon: We had a wonderful confusion of plurals and tenses in a report about Twitter\u2019s shares falling by 19 per cent. The company had admitted a number of problems, including: \u201cUser data also was still being collected even after they believe they had opted out of a feature that asked them if Twitter could use device-specific settings to personalise their timeline.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cthey\u201d refers to the singular \u201cuser\u201d at the start of the sentence, and these users believed they had opted out \u2013 in the past tense. But this is where tech jargon gets you. The \u201cdevice-specific settings\u201d were also unnecessary, so we could tidy up the whole thing thus: \u201cInformation about users was still being collected even after they opted out of a feature that asked them if Twitter could personalise their timeline.\u201d\n\nPancake: Do you remember those innocent days in politics when Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, used to make David Cameron go pink with irritation by doing what was known as his \u201cflatlining\u201d gesture in the House of Commons? I used to point out that this was the wrong term to describe an economy that was not growing \u2013 that is, in which graph showing the size of the economy was basically flat.\n\n\u201cFlatlining\u201d was originally a word used to describe the monitors showing heart or brain activity in a seriously ill patient. When the trace \u201cflatlines\u201d it means the patient is dead. Bad though the financial crisis was, the British economy survived.\n\nIndeed, it was still there last week, when we commented: \u201cYou would expect businesses\u2019 day to day borrowing to be fairly constant at a time when the economy has basically been flatlining.\u201d", "description": "We used \u201cgift\u201d as a verb a few times last week.
