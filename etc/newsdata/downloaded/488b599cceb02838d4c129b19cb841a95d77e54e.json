Subscribing to the Green New Delusion, these protestors called for extreme changes to cut down on emissions, ranging from ending use of fossil fuels to ridding the country of \u201cfarting cows.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThat\u2019s right: cow flatulence.\n\nEver since a 2006 United Nations study claimed raising livestock caused more climate change than cars and all of transportation, environmental extremists have had their crosshairs set on meat. That study was wrong \u2014 the report\u2019s senior author had to issue a correction \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped activists from continuing their false narrative that meat causes climate change. These fibs have led people to stop eating meat in favor of plant-based diets.\n\nTo be clear: I have no problem with Americans voluntarily choosing a vegetarian or vegan diet; I do have a problem with guilting Americans into diet changes based on faulty information.\n\nTake the environmental case for abstention. Less than 4% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. comes from cows, according to the EPA. America has done a great job of managing emissions caused by animals, having doubled the production of livestock while decreasing the amount of emissions produced over the last 60 years. And if you're going to swap out a burger for a banana, remember -- you can bet they\u2019re not shipped here using \u201crenewable\u201d wind-powered ships like in the 17th Century, but rather modern fossil fuels.\n\nToday, companies are marketing products to solve this supposed meat/climate problem: Meat imitations engineered to taste like meat, but made from plant proteins and processed ingredients. Two products you may have seen or tried are the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger.\n\nTo be clear, I like the Impossible Burger and have lauded Beyond\u2019s attitude about the future. But consumers should know the facts before choosing these products for health or environmental reasons.\n\nAccording to a senior Oxford researcher, \u201cplant-based\u201d meats still has an environmental footprint five times larger than your classic black bean patty. Even if we stopped eating meat entirely, it would only reduce emissions by 2.6%.\n\nWhat\u2019s strange is that, while these products are trying to differentiate themselves from real meat, they are also calling themselves \u201cmeat.\u201d But they aren\u2019t meat -- even \u201cplant-based\u201d could be seen as a stretch.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nMeat imitations are science experiments that are fine-tuned to mimic meat. And they aren\u2019t necessarily any healthier than meat: Compared to meat, the pea and soy protein patties can have more calories and sodium.\n\nThe founder of Impossible claims he'll take a \"double-digit\" portion of the beef market in five years, then eventually cause its downfall (and perhaps the downfall of the chicken and pork markets, too).\n\nA more likely trajectory for plant-based meat is seen in the \"gluten-free\" diet fad. Sales of these products have plateaued and are expected to drop further.\n\nOne reason? Some doctors now say that gluten-free diets aren\u2019t any healthier for people who don\u2019t have Celiac disease. In fact, one study found that gluten-free products tend to have more fat, more calories, and less protein than their counterparts.\n\nI suspect plant-based meat is due for a similar reckoning once consumers discover that the \"health halo\" on these products has lost its shine.\n\nEd Rensi is the retired president and CEO of McDonald\u2019s USA.", "description": "To be clear, I like the Impossible Burger and have lauded Beyond\u2019s attitude about the future.
