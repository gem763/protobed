Schiff (D-Calif.) gave information to the whistleblower who raised concerns about the administration\u2019s actions toward Ukraine; attacked his predecessor for signing a deal with Netflix; and turned the Cabinet Room into a stage for a lengthy advertisement for his Florida golf resort, which he originally picked to host a meeting of international leaders before backtracking this weekend in the face of bipartisan criticism.\n\nUnder Trump, Cabinet meetings have become less about the business of his Cabinet than an opportunity for the president to invite in the assembled press to boast of his own accomplishments, lash out at his critics and to hear the praise flow forth from advisers seated around a large oval table. The gatherings, with the press in attendance, often stretch for 60 to 90 minutes.\n\nDuring a June 2017 Cabinet meeting, Trump went around the table, allowing his top aides to thank him for allowing them to serve his administration. Then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus called the opportunity a \u201cblessing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump trashed his former secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, during a Cabinet meeting in January, shortly after he resigned because the retired four-star Marine general said they didn\u2019t share the same perspective on how to treat allies.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he done for me?\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn Monday, the president seemed particularly aggrieved by criticism of his foreign policy decisions in the Middle East, his attempt to stage the Group of Seven meeting at his golf resort in Florida and the ongoing impeachment inquiry by House Democrats that has dominated the headlines. On every front, he said, he was undeserving of the criticism and tried to deflect it back on his opponents. \u201cIllegitimate\u201d and \u201cphony\u201d were his words du jour.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou people with this phony emoluments clause,\u201d he said, dismissing concerns that hosting international leaders at the Trump National Doral Miami resort would have violated the constitutional ban on presidents accepting gifts or money from foreign governments.\n\nAD\n\nHe batted back questions about whether his decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria and the ensuing Turkish military offensive led to the release of Islamic State fighters being guarded by the Kurds. And he cited a loud cheer from a rally crowd in Texas to back his decision to remove the U.S. forces.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who did the capturing,\u201d Trump, who avoided military service with a bone spurs diagnosis, said of Islamic State militants. \u201cI\u2019m the one who knows more about it than you people or the fake pundits.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMuch of the event seemed about self-validation as Trump\u2019s allies describe a presidency under siege \u2014 and a president frustrated with an onslaught of criticism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very good at real estate,\u201d he said, without being asked about his real estate prowess. For several minutes, he used the White House setting to talk up his resort in Florida while defending himself against claims that he uses the presidency to help his properties.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would have been the best G-7 ever,\u201d he said, now saying he would have held it \u201cfor free.\u201d\n\nCritics charging that the meeting would have offered a high promotional value for Trump\u2019s business was also a canard, according to the president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need promotion,\u201d he said. \u201cI get more promotion than any human being that\u2019s ever lived.\u201d\n\nWithout prompting, he informed the government\u2019s top officers \u2014 and the assembled news media \u2014 about his prowess at filling arenas.\n\n\u201cI can set a world record for somebody without a guitar,\u201d he said of his rally crowds.\n\nAt times he segued into criticizing former president Barack Obama, suggesting that he made money off his presidency, conflating his predecessor\u2019s post-presidency book deals and contract with Netflix with charges that Trump\u2019s businesses have directly benefited from his time in office.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cObama made a deal for a book. Did he run a business?\u201d Trump asked. Obama did not have a business in office.\n\nAD\n\nHe also mocked Obama for not securing a meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un \u2014 a brutal dictator who has repeatedly agreed to meet with Trump but has not agreed to give up his nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cActually, he tried, 11 times,\u201d Trump incorrectly said of Obama. \u201cBut the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. Lack of respect.\u201d\n\nThere were a number of false, or dubious, statements. Defending his attempt to stage the G-7 at his resort, he cited the benefit of having the Miami International Airport nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s right down the road,\u201d he said. \u201cSome say it\u2019s the biggest in the world.\u201d The airport does not rank in the international top 20 for size.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said the presidency was costing him \u201cbetween $2 billion and $5 billion,\u201d though there is no evidence for such a claim \u2014 and his own disclosures show he has continued to profit while in the Oval Office.\n\nAD\n\nThe president said only George Washington had given away his salary like Trump does, though historians say John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover donated their pay.\n\nAs the meeting dragged on and Cabinet officials sat silently, there was little talk of the official reason for the gathering, as the president continued to field questions from reporters.\n\nHe gave backhanded praise to Democrats while excoriating at least one prominent critic in his own party for criticizing him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re vicious and they stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst, they don\u2019t have people like that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe described unidentified \u201clowlifes\u201d trying to keep him from getting out of wars \u2014 and said it would be easier for him not to have to visit Walter Reed hospital and Dover Air Force Base to visit injured soldiers or witness the arrival of the remains of those killed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would be much easier for me to let our soldiers be there, let them continue to die,\u201d he said. \u201cI go out to Dover and meet parents and it\u2019s the most unpleasant thing I do.\u201d\n\nToward the end, he turned to the day\u2019s official agenda \u2014 touting the economic benefits of the number of regulations his administration has cut or weakened.\n\nFor that he first turned to National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, a man Trump described as a \u201cgreat, great remark maker.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be great. Let them know how we are doing. We\u2019re doing poorly, let them know,\u201d he told Kudlow. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that is going to happen.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t.", "description": "They have served as an opportunity for the president to invite in the assembled press to boast of his own accomplishments, lash out at his critics and to hear the praise flow forth from advisers seated around a large table in the White House Cabinet Room.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gExhUcYF1Z3vFp0anIXM9tqwGHU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N7ASBFXUEQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
