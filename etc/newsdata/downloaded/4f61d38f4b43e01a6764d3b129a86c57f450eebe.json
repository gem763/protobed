I just walked away and my teammates didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201d\n\nAccording to Abukaram, the situation left her feeling \u201chumiliated, disappointed, rejected and in denial\u201d and she feels that her \u201crights as an athlete were violated\u201d because she was not given the same opportunity as her teammate.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t given the chance to explain myself to them because they didn\u2019t have the decency to tell me what the issue was,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She ended up finishing in 22 minutes and 22 seconds, the best race of her season.\n\nFollowing the race, the varsity cross-country coach says he checked the rule book, and was unable to find \u201cany clause that prevents or prohibits hair coverings like Noor\u2019s\u201d.\n\nAbukaram reiterated this, writing on Facebook that \u201cthis rule does NOT exist in writing\u201d and that she feels she should \u201cnot have to get a waiver signed and approved by OHSAA to allow me to race due to my religious head covering\u201d.\n\nIn response to the post, which has been shared more than 2,000 times, Abukaram has received an outpouring of support.\n\n\u201cI hope this brave young woman helps clear a path and correct the situation for all of the girls that will compete after her wearing hijabs,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother commented: \u201cFrom one Ohioan to another, I am so sorry to hear about this Noor! Undeniably discriminatory and incredibly unfair!\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted the OHSAA for comment.", "description": "A high school cross-country runner was disqualified from a district meet despite running her fastest race of the season - because she was wearing a hijab.
