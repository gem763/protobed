Carles Puigdemont, the ousted Catalan president considered a fugitive in Spain, denied any links to the activists during a Tuesday interview with Catalan radio in Brussels, where he fled in 2017 after the independence bid.\n\nPuigdemont, who has successfully fought off extradition cases in Belgium and Germany, accused Spanish authorities of looking for ammunition to make a fresh attempt to arrest him.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to push a narrative to accuse me of terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s referendum anniversary protests took place amid a strong police presence, especially in train stations and on highways, which activists have targeted in the past.\n\nIn Girona, some activists threw eggs filled with red paint at riot police and overtunred large trash containers. Marchers holding smoke torches shouted \u201cOut with the occupying forces!\u201d at the gates of the city\u2019s Civil Guard barracks, before moving to the Spanish government\u2019s provincial delegation to stage a sit-in.\n\nA bigger demonstration is expected in the evening in Barcelona, departing from a central square and touring some of the local schools that were stormed by riot police when they were turned into polling stations for the illegal vote.\n\nPolls and recent elections show that the 5.5 million voters of Catalonia are roughly evenly split on the independence issue.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Aritz Parra contributed from Madrid.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A few hundred secession supporters marched early Tuesday in the northeastern city of Girona to mark two years since a banned independence referendum that shook Spanish politics.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Emilio Morenatti"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/aptopix_spain_catalonia_10485_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
