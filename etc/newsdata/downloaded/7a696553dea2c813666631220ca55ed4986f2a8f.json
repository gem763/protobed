In other words, splitting the pie, not expanding it.\n\nCollaboration\n\nResearch by Harvard\u2019s Heidi Gardner reveals there is a significant financial upside when partners work together to solve wicked client problems. She distinguishes this kind of integrative collaboration from cross-selling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former is about drawing together a diversity of knowledge and experiences to add value to clients. The latter is merely an arm's-length referral to a colleague.\n\nConsistent high standards\n\nIn a recent panel discussion, I asked three general counsel what distinguished top firms from the rest. \"Consistency\" was the universal response. Leading firms were characterised by extremely high technical and service standards delivered consistently by all staff at all levels.\n\nSuccessful firms are those that have cultures that are intolerant of mediocrity and expect, and get, high standards from everyone.\n\nDiscretionary effort\n\nOrganisation cultures that are perceived to be purpose-driven and genuinely caring, trusting and fair tend to get the best out of people. Staff are more likely to go the extra mile, to act above and beyond the call of duty, or just do that little bit more.\n\nToxic cultures often result in lower productivity, higher absenteeism and substandard output.\n\nContinuity\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuity builds deeper client understanding and fosters trusting relationships. In a study in a large bank, the researchers found that where a client had five different relationship managers over a two-year period only 40 per cent of clients were satisfied.\n\nThis jumped to over 80 per cent where there had been only one relationship manager.\n\nPositive firm cultures facilitate retention and ensure continuity. A stable workforce also reduces the direct costs associated with staff churn.\n\nSelf-management\n\nEach of the three firms mentioned earlier are characterised by a lean management structure. All senior people, excluding the managing partner, still retain significant practices. Each team within the firm has an ethos of self-sufficiency.\n\nThey don\u2019t see themselves as paralysed subordinates waiting for orders.\n\nAlignment around firm direction, trust in leadership and a strong culture provide the glue that binds the collective but at the same time encourages individual empowerment.\n\nAccountability for action\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrange as it seems, many firms struggle with simply doing what they say they will do. An accountability culture is one where there\u2019s a bias towards keeping promises and there\u2019s less denial and deflection in cases of inaction. Successful firms have the discipline to implement strategy and the fortitude to overcome obstacles that might emerge.\n\nIt is common for law firms to describe their cultures as \"collegiate\", \"respectful\" and \"friendly\".\n\nIn these tough times, just being nice is not going to be enough. It is incumbent on every professional service leader to strive towards a cohesive, productive, healthy and disciplined culture.\n\nThis type of culture will take care of breakfast, but it will also allow a firm to have a strategy for lunch and a glass of the finest champagne over dinner.\n\nJoel Barolsky is MD of Barolsky Advisors and a senior fellow of the University of Melbourne.", "description": "The secret of successful firms that consistently outperform their peers lies in their organisational culture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d610bbf8dcefc6c27905bdd2300b7ea1142dae7f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
