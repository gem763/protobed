Who knows.\n\n\u2018I am going to kill Hugh Jackman, I am going marry Margot Robbie as I would like to f**k her for life, and then I will f**k the Hemsworth brothers but at the same time the both of them,\u2019 she told Zach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut bad news Liam, she may not be the marrying type, as she added: \u2018I couldn\u2019t marry them.\n\n\u2018I would be too insecure, I\u2019d just be like \u201cyou\u2019re too attractive you cannot leave the house\u201d.\u2019\n\n\u2018I will f**k the Hemsworth brothers but the same time the both of them,\u2019 she said (Picture: Youtube)\n\nLiam was snapped on Thursday holding hands with Dynasty actress Maddison, two months after he separated from wife of eight months, Miley.\n\nAfter hiding out in Byron Bay for weeks, the 29-year-old was papped in New York City \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nLiam hid out in Byron Bay for a few weeks with his brothers (Picture: Instagram)\n\nLiam was seen holding hands with fellow Aussie Maddison as they walked over a zebra crossing, and we don\u2019t think the actor was just guiding her over the road.\n\nLater in the evening the pair were snapped again after a night out with pals, passionately kissing in the street with no care for who was watching.\n\nMaddison is best known for playing Kirby Anders on the Dynasty reboot, and also had a role in Strangerland opposite Nicole Kidman.\n\nMaddison is a 22-year-old actress (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Hemsworth has chosen to get back on the dating scene, considering his ex is onto her second post-marriage relationship.\n\nMiley, 26, was pictured kissing Kaitlynn Carter as news of her split from Liam broke, and the girls went on to date for a month before parting ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the We Can\u2019t Stop singer is hooking up with Cody Simpson, even calling the Aussie musician her \u2018boyfriend\u2019 after he visited her in the hospital while she was recovering from tonsillitis.\n\nMiley has been sharing selfies with her beau all over social media, so we doubt she\u2019ll be too peeved that Liam is out here holding hands with a new girl.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
