So I think countries need to wake up.\u201d\n\nChief Scientific Officer at Johnson & Johnson, Paul Stoffels, said developing drugs to combat the disease is an expensive business: \u201cIt\u2019s as expensive as a cancer drug, an immune drug. It takes the same time, the same effort.\n\n\"But, if there\u2019s no real market in the world, it\u2019s very difficult to put a billion dollars behind a TB development programme.\u201d\n\nWatch Good Morning Europe's interview with Peter Sands, Executive Director of The Global Fund in the player above.", "description": "A conference in France, which kicked off on Wednesday, aims to raise funds to combat deadly diseases and condemn them to the history books.", "authors": ["Joao Vitor Da Silva Marques"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/83/70/1000x563_cmsv2_fbbda873-b6d1-58ef-b5d1-9b3e61bcedb0-4218370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
