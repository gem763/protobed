So, we basically hounded him to let us into his studio for this new online series, In the Studio with Steven Sabados, where we get to actually follow along step-by-step as Steven teaches how to make original art, DIY, fashion and home decor pieces that he's created.\n\nIf you've been yearning to unlock your inner artist or take advantage of the myriad positive effects of art therapy on your health and happiness, this is your chance to finally do it with Steven. His first passion is fine art - he has a degree in it! - and he's recently used painting for its therapeutic benefits in difficult times. Over the years, he's blended art with design and other creations, and in this series he'll teach us how to paint with watercolours, silk screen, learn shibori and much, much more.\n\nFor this first project, Steven chose Marble Hydro Dipping. \"This is probably the coolest thing that I've recently come across,\" he says, \"and I'm kind of doing it to everything.\" It's a really fun and easy project with high impact results.\n\nUnlock your inner artist with Steven in his new web series starting with the coolest thing he\u2019s come across lately 9:15\n\nHere's what you'll need to follow along:\n\nA large plastic tub\n\nWater\n\nSpray paint in the colours you like\n\nMake sure you try this project in a well ventilated area, so take the laptop to the garage or outside if you want to follow along with Steven.\n\nPlease share photos of your Marble Hydro Dipping creations with us on our Facebook page so we can add them here!", "description": "Unlock your inner artist with Steven, starting with the coolest thing he\u2019s come across lately", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4289809.1505409687!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/steven-sabados-hydro-dipping.jpg"}
