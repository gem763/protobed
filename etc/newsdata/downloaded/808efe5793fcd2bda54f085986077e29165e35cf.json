We tested a whole range of items to come up with this list of our truly best buys.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Well, you can with Whirli\u2019s subscription service. With gift cards available from \u00a310 (the cheapest subscription model is \u00a39.99 per month), this takes all the hassle out of trying to find a toy a child hasn\u2019t already received. Parents will love how easy it is to simply log on and choose a plan that suits them (the pricier the plan, the more tokens available for toys). There\u2019s a huge range of second-hand toys to select and, after trialing it for several months, we can confirm all items were excellent quality, appeared as new and arrived completely clean (Whirli sterilise them too). Once done, customers can pop the toys back in the post (return postage is free) and select their next bundle. We loved the sheer variety of toys available in the library: there\u2019s everything from jumparoos to books to building bricks; meaning there\u2019s always going to be something the little one will love. What\u2019s more, it's a great way of cutting down on plastic consumption AND saving space.\n\nBuy now\n\nStokke tripp trapp chair: From \u00a3178, Stokke\u200b\n\nThis is a beautifully made \u2013 and ergonomically designed \u2013 piece of wooden furniture that will grow with a child. Available in a variety of wood types and colours (with full name personalisation for that truly unique touch), it\u2019s the perfect alternative to the usual high chair. We were impressed with the craftsmanship, and that although it\u2019s extremely sturdy, it doesn\u2019t take up much space and easily becomes part of the furniture. We think its an ideal choice for godparents or close family, and parents will love that it brings them right up to the kitchen table with the rest of the family. If this is for a newborn, you can also get the newborn set (a nest style cushion with harness that can be attached to the chair), or for older babies, a baby set can also be purchased to convert it into a comfortable high chair. It\u2019s fairly pricey but it is a gift that will truly last a generation.\n\nBuy now\n\nFabric photo album: From \u00a325, My 1st Photos\n\nEvery proud parent loves sharing a photo (or 10) of their newborn, so why not compile a fabric photo book of their favourite snaps? The soft cloth is perfect for tiny hands and, as the book is washable and uses non-toxic ink, you don\u2019t need to worry if they end up in their mouths either. Books can have between 5-18 pictures \u2013 photos from phones and Instagram do work, but we think professional images work best \u2013 and you can caption them too. We found this gift to be particularly useful for babies around six months and onwards; when parents are trying to encourage their little one\u2019s first words and help them recognise faces.\n\nBuy now\n\nMunchkin and Bear large Melbourne MOD padded play mat: \u00a3129.95, Munchkin and Bear\n\nParenthood sees everyone\u2019s living room transformed into a chaotic playroom and while there\u2019s no instant tidying solution, you can make at least one thing stylish with this. Those with rolling and crawling babies will find this a godsend, but it\u2019s suitable for all ages. The super plush, extra thick mat is far more padded than any other we\u2019ve come across before and it\u2019s plenty big enough to fit baby, siblings, and all the family. As well as having lots of practicality points (it\u2019s wipe clean and made of non-toxic PU), the real selling point is just how truly stylish these playmats are. At a glance, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking they are actually statement rugs for brightening up a living space. There\u2019s a variety of designs and while we think the Melbourne design is ideal for brightening up any family\u2019s neutral space; there\u2019s also a variety of different colours to slot in with decor. This play mat is more expensive than most, but we really do believe it is worth every penny.\n\nBuy now\n\nPrezzybox personalised the A to Z of wonderful things book: \u00a321.99, Prezzybox\u200b\n\nStorytime is so important for little ones and that\u2019s why we love this A to Z book. We all know children love to see their names in print, but the fun doesn\u2019t stop there; with personalisation allowing you to add your own special message to the child, along with adding details like their siblings' names, date of birth and their hometown to bring their life on to the page. The beautiful illustrations make this book feel extra special and make it a lovely christening gift.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Dou-Doods baby comforter: \u00a325, The Dou-Doods\n\nLots of babies love to snuggle up to a comforter and chances are most parents have one stuffed into every bag. We love these from Dou-Doods as they\u2019re cool and super soft. Each of the 14 comforters comes with a little personality and we loved the label with their name and date of birth; sure to treasured by any young recipient. If gifting this one to a newborn, the wide, flat surface is ideal for them to safely snuggle with (it\u2019s made from really soft cotton jersey so we found it to be ideal for sensitive skin) while slightly older babies will love the black and white design and gripping on to the ears, fingers and toes. If you\u2019re gifting to a family, you can also purchase a matching mask for older siblings so they don\u2019t feel left out by all the fun!\n\nBuy now\n\nPrezzybox personalised initials baby raincoat: \u00a329.99, Prezzybox\n\nNow we\u2019re properly into autumn, this adorable raincoat is the perfect stylish addition to any baby\u2019s wardrobe. Available in three bold colours (the vibrant yellow was a hit with our mother and child tester) and four different sizes that go from six months to four years, it\u2019s a practical but beautiful coat that does a great job of protecting from the essential protection from the elements. You can also have it personalised with three initials.\n\nBuy now\n\nLittle Box of Books subscription (0-3-year-olds): From \u00a318.99, Little Box of Books\n\nFamilies come in all shapes and sizes but despite living in a thriving diverse society, that\u2019s not always reflected in the books children read. Cue Little Box of Books; a service that delivers inclusive children\u2019s books into homes all around the country (both gift box options and different length subscriptions are available). The stories remain compelling but what\u2019s different is you\u2019ll find families being shown in all different ways, characters with disabilities and from different backgrounds. We received the three book subscription ( \u00a324.99 a month), which featured a mix of books (such as the board book Amelia which tells the story of the pilot Amelia Earheart and the mesmerising Little Mermaid picture book, retold with a range of diverse characters.) Alongside this, for each box purchased, Little Box of Books donates a brand new book to Doorstep Library; a charity that works with disadvantaged families in London to promote reading. We really love the concept and it would be the perfect gift for parents keen to teach children about the world around them.\n\nBuy now\n\nHippychick plush wheelybug ride on toy: \u00a369.95, Hippychick\n\nLooking for a gift for a child who always wants to be on the move? This is it, and we love it. Aimed at aged one and up, the bright animal designs will attract all ages and the plush covers \u2013 the hedgehog being our favourite \u2013 are soft to snuggle up to but also easy to be washed and changed. Unlike other toys, this can be ridden in all different directions; making it easy to navigate.Younger babies can be pushed along while holding on to the animal, and older babies can navigate themselves making an ideal transitional toy for learning skills like coordination that are vital for bike riding. An adorable product that\u2019s designed to last.\n\nBuy now\n\nBooks & Pieces 'Baby, Let\u2019s Eat!': \u00a34, Books & Pieces\n\nPart of the Indestructible range, this book promises something very special indeed: it\u2019s rip-proof (believe us, we tried our absolute best to disprove this on behalf of our readers but got nowhere!), chew-proof, non-toxic and super easy to wash! This is the ideal budget-friendly gift for a teething baby who loves nothing more than putting everything in their mouth. Featuring super-bright colours and simple drawings and labeling of staple foods, it\u2019s a particularly fun read for those between six months to one year as they start their weaning journey and learn all about the food around them.\n\nBuy now\n\nKokoso baby bundle: \u00a344, Kokoso\n\nThis luxurious bundle of organic baby skincare is really a gift for both mum and baby and comprises of two types of thick and creamy hair and body wash (softly scented and fragrance-free); a giant tub of wonder product coconut oil, konjac baby sponge and natural wooden hairbrush and spoon. As soon as we opened these products, we were taken in by their natural coconutty smell and their velvety texture; both gliding on wonderfully to our baby\u2019s skin. The wooden hairbrush and coconut oil did a fantastic job of tackling cradle cap, which any parent knows can be a real bugbear for the first six months or so of a baby\u2019s life. Older children will love to hold the super absorbent, squidgy sponge as they learn to wash themselves. There\u2019s plenty of baby skincare on the market but these really are exceptional quality; any parent would love to receive this (and we can bet, if they\u2019re anything like us, mum will happily borrow them herself too).\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Gifts for newborn to 1-year-olds\n\nWe love Whirli\u2019s subscription service: it means there\u2019s zero chance of getting a present that ends up in the \"to bin\" pile and is a fantastic way for parents to cut down on their plastic purchases. For a bigger invested, Munchkin and Bear\u2019s plush play mats are stylish and sturdy and really will revolutionise playrooms. Finally, for those on a budget, we loved Baby, Let\u2019s Eat! by Books & Pieces; a great read that thanks to it\u2019s \u2018indestructible\u2019 label will last longer than most on their bookshelf.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
