It will also conduct research on further relaxing market access in FTZs, and opening up the service sector, he said.\n\nSince 2013, 18 free trade pilot zones have appeared across the nation. The country also expanded the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to the Lingang New Area.\n\nOn Sept 9, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), presided over the 10th meeting of the central committee for deepening overall reform.\n\nDuring the meeting, Xi, also the Chinese president, chairman of the Central Military Commission and head of the central committee for deepening overall reform, said efforts should be made to strengthen synergy, coordination and efficiency in advancing reform.\n\nOfficial data showed China's foreign trade maintained stable growth in the first three quarters of 2019.
