Engaged employees are also more likely to see their job as a calling and derive deeper meaning from the day-to-day work.\n\nBut you can have too much of a good thing, and job engagement is no exception.\n\nNew research shows that employees who are too engaged are likely to have difficulties in their personal lives and may take part in actions that negatively affect the company. In addition, such workers can become more difficult to manage over time and produce worse results.\n\nDeeply engaged employees who become more difficult to manage can be overly demanding of superiors and become suspicious of their intentions, says Stuart Bunderson, professor of organizational ethics and governance at Washington University in St. Louis. When Prof. Bunderson first started looking at how zookeepers derived meaning from their work, for example, he learned that many tend to look at their job as a calling. That, in turn, made them tougher to manage than less-engaged employees. They also expected more from those above them. The zookeepers objected to placing a carousel at the zoo, for instance, because they saw it as trivializing the zoo\u2019s mission, until it was repositioned to promote conservation, Prof. Bunderson found.\n\nThe professor also studied managers five years after receiving their M.B.A. degrees and found that the most engaged employees displayed similar qualities. A \u201chigher sense of moral duty\u201d makes it tougher for them to respect deadlines or work in a team, he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as acceptable compromises or good enough when things are framed in moral terms,\u201d says Prof. Bunderson, who in January published a review of research into work as a calling. \u201cSo, for example, if I see my calling as helping my consulting clients find the best possible solution for their problem,\u201d he says, \u201cI will become especially frustrated when management tells me that I need to push certain solutions or limit the amount of time I can spend in problem diagnosis\u2026especially when compared to my colleague for whom a job is just a job.\u201d\n\nSome researchers have found that work engagement has a negative impact on a personal level. In a 2018 study, after a three-month period, workers who said they felt emotional ties to their work reported experiencing more stress in reaction to workplace demands than workers who said they didn\u2019t feel emotional ties to their work, says Thomas Britt, a psychology professor at Clemson University who studies work engagement.\n\nExcessive work engagement may be especially detrimental for senior-level executives, says Ante Glavas, a University of Vermont professor who is studying the impact that engaged employees can have on their direct reports.\n\n\u201cYou can have this existential level of engagement that leads to interpreting that the rules don\u2019t apply to you,\u201d says Dr. Glavas. Senior managers who exhibit this kind of behavior, he says, may start to ignore day-to-day responsibilities and feel it is their job to focus on social or environmental missions instead. Such managers also may feel that instead of focusing on their day-to-day roles, they should pursue projects that they deem more important or that are more prominent within the company.\n\nDeeply engaged employees also are more likely to cut corners. In a study of lower-level sales employees in China, researchers found that pharmaceutical sales workers who were more engaged in their work were more likely to behave unethically on the job\u2014doing such things as sabotaging colleagues to take credit for their work, leaving colleagues out of important meetings or not sharing relevant information with others on the team. \u201cThe feeling of [job] ownership is the key to increasing engagement and is associated with negative outcomes,\u201d says Melody Jun Zhang, assistant professor of management at City University of Hong Kong.\n\nSo what can companies do to have healthy levels of work engagement, without crossing the line into excessive levels? Ease up, some researchers say.\n\nOne suggestion is that companies should skip the emphasis on engaging workers through corporate social responsibility, which often takes place outside of an employee\u2019s direct job description. In a 2016 review of literature on the subject, Prof. Glavas found evidence suggesting that attempting \u201ccorporate social responsibility strategies\u201d such as volunteering is likely to breed employee resentment even as it creates more engagement.\n\nDirect managers should focus on engaging those who are unengaged rather than attempting to raise overall engagement numbers, says Tomas Chamorro, chief talent scientist at staffing agency ManpowerGroup Inc. in New York. Surveys that seek to measure individual engagement or that compare employees with benchmarks at other companies can also increase the kind of extreme engagement that is detrimental, says Mr. Chamarro.\n\n\u201cWe still want them to be engaged, but moderately engaged,\u201d he says. \u201cA certain degree of dissatisfaction is very positive. Even good things are bad at extreme levels.\u201d\n\nMs. Dizik is a writer in Chicago.
