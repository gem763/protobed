AAPL 1.18% unveiled a trio of iPhones with additional cameras and stronger battery life, betting that improvements to familiar features along with a suite of low-price subscription services will enliven flagging sales of the devices.\n\nAt its marquee product showcase in the Steve Jobs Theater, the company\u2019s on-campus auditorium named after Apple\u2019s co-founder, the tech giant lavished much of its time Tuesday on the flagship device he helped create a dozen years ago. The trio of new but familiar-looking iPhones\u2014now under the iPhone 11 brand\u2014blended standard updates such as longer-lasting batteries and new colors with more innovative features such as a night mode for low-light photos and the ability to shoot video by holding down the camera button.\n\nApple also introduced an updated smartwatch with improved power that allows it to display time throughout the day, and the company set prices for its new TV+ and Arcade videogame subscription services\u2014which largely undercut competitors with a price of $4.99 a month. TV+ comes free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac, a perk that could get more people to buy a new device or upgrade.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t reveal any surprise new devices, delivering instead the type of incremental hardware improvements that have defined its events in recent years and stirred up questions about Apple\u2019s innovation prowess under Chief Executive Tim Cook. Mr. Jobs\u2019s successor has transformed Apple into one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies but hasn\u2019t delivered a megahit product on par with the iPhone, which made its debut in 2007, or the iPad, first released in 2010, the year before Mr. Cook took over.\n\nThe Apple Watch made its debut five years ago and has largely been a success, as have the more recent AirPods wireless earbuds, but not enough to shore up falling iPhone sales. Mr. Cook has since pushed Apple to leverage its hardware success to sell more software and services.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you plan on switching to any of the new iPhone models? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe watch and new subscription services are central to Apple\u2019s efforts to diversify its business as the iPhone falters. Its customers are holding on to current iPhones longer and bristling at prices of new models that average nearly $1,000. Those struggles are particularly acute in China, where Apple is battling increased competition, trade tensions and a decelerating economy.\n\nAmid the backdrop, Apple lowered the price of its most popular model by $50, countering three consecutive years of price increases. The iPhone 11, a 6.1-inch device that updates last year\u2019s XR model, will start at $699 and include a dual-rear camera.\n\nIts two higher-priced devices come with triple-rear cameras and are stamped with the \u201cPro\u201d brand, a nod to a more premium market. The iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999, featuring a 5.8-inch OLED display, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max, at $1,099, has a plus-size, 6.5-inch display.\n\nApple said the phones will make their debuts on Sept. 20.\n\nApple also lowered the price of one of its Apple Watch models, reducing the Series 3 by 33% to $199. It maintained a price of $399 on the company\u2019s newest model, the Series 5.\n\nThe smartwatch prices showed Apple is willing to eat the cost of tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers. The Apple Watch was among its first products subjected to the 15% tariffs the Trump administration introduced on $111 billion in Chinese-made goods earlier this month.\n\nApple can absorb the extra costs of tariffs without it affecting margins because memory prices have fallen in recent years, providing a cushion, analysts said.\n\nThe company priced its TV+ subscription well below Netflix Inc., which charges $12.99 a month for the standard option, and Walt Disney Co. , which will offer a new streaming service in November for $6.99 a month. Mr. Cook touted Apple\u2019s $4.99 price tag as a deal, comparing it to the cost of a digital movie rental.\n\n\u201cYou can be aggressive on services prices without it negatively affecting your brand,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cClearly, they want their customers to use it and not feel forced to choose between it and Netflix or Hulu.\u201d\n\nTV+ will make its debut Nov. 1 with shows such as \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a drama about a morning talk show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Additional shows will be added in the months afterward, Mr. Cook said.\n\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook touted the price for TV+, saying it was comparable to a movie rental on iTunes.

It has more than 900 million iPhone users world-wide, but only a fraction own an Apple Watch or pay for the company\u2019s streaming-music service. It has rolled out several new accessories and services to deepen its reach into users\u2019 wallets, including AirPods wireless earbuds, a credit card and a videogame service called Arcade.\n\nThe emphasis on services and newer products has coincided with several high-profile executive departures, including design chief Jony Ive, who will leave later this year to start his own design firm. It has also revived questions about the company\u2019s ability to offer the type of hardware innovations that turned the iPhone into one of the world\u2019s best-selling products.\n\n\u201cApple isn\u2019t growing like they were before,\u201d said Mike Frazier, president of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, a Walnut Creek, Calif.-based firm with about $500 million under management that counted Apple as its largest holding before scaling back its investment this year. \u201cThey\u2019re a victim of their own success.\u201d\n\nApple needs to encourage enough iPhone upgrades to avoid repeating the smartphone sales slump that dogged the company last year, forcing it to slash its revenue forecast in January for the first time in more than 15 years. Worldwide sales of the company\u2019s smartphones fell 15% to $109.02 billion for the three quarters ended in June. Shipments have declined an estimated 17% over that period, according to analysts, outpacing the smartphone industry\u2019s projected decline of 2% this year.\n\nWall Street has already begun to look ahead to next year\u2019s models that are expected to feature 5G, a faster fifth generation of wireless technology that will result in speedier smartphones. It will be lagging behind rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. in bringing that technology to market.\n\n\u201cThey will lose market share in China in the premium space without 5G because the country is going to ensure 5G is relevant,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cThat will trigger adoption of Huawei, Xiaomi and others and hurt Apple.\u201d\n\nDow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.\n\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "description": "Apple unveiled a trio of iPhones with additional cameras and stronger battery life, betting the moves coupled with subscription services will enliven flagging sales of the devices.", "authors": ["Tripp Mickle", "Tripp.Mickle Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105847/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
