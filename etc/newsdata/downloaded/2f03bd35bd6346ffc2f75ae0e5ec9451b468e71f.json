He spent 10 seasons with Minnesota, rushing for 11,747 yards.\n\nPeterson\u2019s lone game against the Vikings happened in 2017 when he was with the New Orleans Saints. That game, a Week 1 loss, produced Peterson\u2019s famous stare-down with Saints coach Sean Payton \u2014 as cameras caught the two arguing on the sideline. Peterson finished with just 18 yards on six carries.\n\nOver the last two weeks, Peterson has become the source of the Redskins\u2018 offense. When the team fired coach Jay Gruden, Callahan put an emphasis on his commitment to the run.\n\nThat delighted Peterson, who has 199 yards on 43 carries in the last two games. Peterson was inactive for Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles, as well.\n\nRunning back Chris Thompson said Thursday\u2019s game will \u201cbe emotional\u201d for Peterson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be bigger for AP more than anybody,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe had and made a lot of memories in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nThompson is also dealing with an injury of his own. The 29-year-old missed Sunday\u2019s loss with a toe injury and said he did not know if he will be to face the Vikings. The Redskins won\u2019t practice in pads this week as they prepare a short turnaround.\n\nPeterson\u2019s injury, too, comes on the heels of new criticism of the grounds-keeping at FedEx Field.\n\n49ers cornerback Richard Sherman ripped the conditions of the field after their win, comparing it to when former Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III tore his ACL in the 2012 playoffs against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nPuddles of water and mud formed as rain poured throughout. Players consistently slipped as they tried to run upfield, also sliding when tackled.\n\n\u201cYeah, that was as bad as I have seen,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve played in this stadium once before in the playoffs and it was pretty bad. That\u2019s the year (Griffin) went down with a knee injury and the field was pretty awful. It was mostly sand, like playing in the sandpit. (On Sunday,) it was rain and everything was going bad.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
