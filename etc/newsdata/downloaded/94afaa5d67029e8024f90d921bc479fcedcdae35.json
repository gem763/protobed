However, when I tuned in, Ledger was already revving up to deliver more definitive takes.\n\n\"Phony partisan impeachment inquiry driven by the Democrat caucus in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional and it is in violation,\" Ledger said in a recent episode.\n\nLedger was, of course, referring to the legitimately elected Democratic majority in the House. He echoed a point White House counsel member Pat Cipollone made in a letter to lawmakers slamming the inquiry as \"baseless, unconstitutional.\" This was widely dismissed as a fiery distraction tactic on behalf of the president, but Ledger stated it as fact.\n\nLedger then presented the story of a Virginia teacher who said he was fired for not using a student's preferred pronouns and lamented what he called the \"pronoun hell our culture is being pulled down into.\" As he spoke, the banners flashed \"embracing Judeo-Christian values\" and \"Constitutional concerns.\"\n\nIt's easy to imagine how Ledger's show, with his claims of \"constitutional travesty\" and critiques of \"radical\" people and the \"fascist Left,\" would be pleasing to Trump, serving him good headlines or certain issues that could light the fire behind his next tweet.\n\nThe president shortly thereafter delivered on that hypothesis, quoting Ledger by name and doubling down on the host's \"Constitutional Travesty\" claim in a tweet, adding that it was \"the likes of which we have never seen before. It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!\"\n\nWay before the hour timeslot was up, the show left me feeling angry and suspicious that almost every person in a position of power was trying to suppress my freedom.\n\nLedger's sign-off left me scratching my head when he told the audience, in what could serve as an ironclad boost of his credibility after an hour of bombastic claims, to remember that \"Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.\"", "description": "The six-year-old network is something of a surprise competitor for President Donald Trump's long favorite and massive conservative mainstay, Fox News.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db71520dee019707d69aed6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
