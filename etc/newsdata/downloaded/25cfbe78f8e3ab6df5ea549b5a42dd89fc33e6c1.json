Wirtz, one of four Americans killed in a suicide bombing in Syria, at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It is the most solemn of rituals for American presidents: comforting the soldiers wounded under his command or the families of those who have died. For generations, presidents have typically discussed those encounters in the most delicate of tones.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing I have to do, by far, much harder than the witch hunt, is signing letters to parents of soldiers that have been killed,\u201d President Donald Trump said at the White House this month.\n\nBut in arguing that there must be an end to \u201cendless wars\u201d in Afghanistan and more recently in Syria, Trump has given graphic accounts of distraught widows and disfigured soldiers in terms rarely, if ever, heard from a president before. In one recent instance, he said he had seen grieving family members \u201cmake sounds, scream and cry like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nTrump has particularly focused on describing the ceremony of transferring the flag-draped coffins of U.S. soldiers killed overseas from the military cargo planes that have brought their remains home to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.\n\nIn his telling, it is a gut-wrenching ordeal, a scene of anguish from the families of the fallen that bolsters his determination to bring American soldiers home from overseas conflicts. The public shares that desire, according to one recent survey, which found that 46% of Americans believe that military intervention makes the country less safe, while just 27% believe the opposite.\n\nAll recent presidents have struggled with the cost of war, and how to speak publicly about it, and to many of his supporters, Trump is talking in authentic and admirably frank terms about a reality many Americans and Washington policymakers never confront.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s comments also offend some veterans and military experts. They say that solemn words about fallen heroes ring hollow from a president who received a Vietnam draft deferment and who has managed a dangerously chaotic foreign policy.\n\nOthers wince at the bluntness of Trump\u2019s accounts.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d said Andrew J. Bacevich, a retired Army colonel turned author and historian whose son was killed while serving in Iraq in 2007. \u201cThose are infinitely private and painful moments. And to have anyone presume to comment on that, I think is beyond reprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s politicizing casualties,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has paid two visits to Dover Air Force Base, according to a White House spokesman, but it is unclear whether he has actually witnessed such scenes himself, or is repeating accounts he has heard from the military officers he has encountered there.\n\nAt a recent rally in Minnesota, the president referred to a widow jumping \u201con top of the flowers,\u201d adding \u201cI\u2019ve seen this.\u201d But the coffins unloaded at Dover, known as transfer cases, are not adorned with flowers.\n\nVisiting Dover is a \u201ca very tough experience,\u201d he said at the rally, describing grieving families awaiting the return of their deceased sons or daughters with remarkable poise.\n\nOn his first visit, the president said, he told an unnamed colonel that the relatives he had met appeared to be \u201cdoing great.\u201d The colonel warned that would change: \u201cNo sir, they\u2019re not going to do great. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThen, Trump said, \u201cthis big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane,\u201d a door opens and lowers a ramp, down which several soldiers carry a flag-draped coffin.\n\n\u201cAnd I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll run to the coffin. They\u2019ll break through military barriers,\u201d he said on another occasion, and \u201crun to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin. Crying mothers and wives. Crying desperately.\u201d\n\nDan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that supports a noninterventionist American foreign policy, called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201csome of the most powerful and most eloquent remarks of his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was very important that he take some time to remind the American people of the human toll of these endless wars,\u201d said Caldwell, a former Marine who served a tour of duty in Iraq. \u201cPolicymakers, especially here in Washington, D.C., need to understand that these wars have a real cost,\u201d he added.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- It is the most solemn of rituals for American presidents: comforting the soldiers wounded under his command or the families of those who have died.
