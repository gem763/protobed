It was blatant.\u201d\n\nThen Cameron echoes the explicitly racist Conservative campaign slogan used in Smethwick in 1964: \u201cThey might as well have said: \u2018If you want a Muslim for a neighbour, vote \u201cremain\u201d.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Smethwick, Peter Griffiths had been elected as Conservative MP on the slogan \u201cIf you want a n**** for a neighbour, vote Labour.\u201d\n\nCameron writes that Johnson\u2019s claims of concerns about British sovereignty were \u201csecondary to another concern for Boris: what was the best outcome for him?\u201d\n\nJohnson \u201crisked an outcome he didn\u2019t believe in because it would help his political career\u201d and was open to a second referendum after a renegotiation, according to a Sunday Times account of Cameron\u2019s book, For The Record.\n\nCameron is even more acerbic about Gove, who was once his close friend. Writing about Gove\u2019s decision to stand against Johnson for Tory leader, he says: \u201cAs for Michael, one quality shone through: disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris.\u201d\n\nTheir conduct during the EU referendum campaign amounted to \u201copen warfare\u201d and the pair seemed to be different people by the end, Cameron writes. \u201cBoth then behaved appallingly, attacking their own government, turning a blind eye to their side\u2019s unpleasant actions and becoming ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism.\u201d\n\nHe said Patel\u2019s attacks on his government\u2019s immigration record \u201cshocked me most\u201d but he did not want to fire her and create a \u201cBrexit martyr\u201d. Cummings was part of a \u201ccauldron of toxicity\u201d with Nigel Farage, he says.\n\nReaction to Cameron\u2019s memoirs has seen the former PM attacked by Conservatives from all wings of the party.\n\nBrexiters were enraged by his suggestion that a second referendum might be necessary and that the Vote Leave campaign lied.\n\nBut Justine Greening, Cameron\u2019s former international development secretary who now sits as an independent MP, said his decision to hold the EU referendum had proved to be a \u201chorrendous mistake\u201d that turned a Tory obsession into a national issue.\n\nGreening said she had most concerns about how the Remain campaign was conducted, with major failings in an \u201celitist\u201d Remain campaign that had failed to reach out enough sufficiently to young voters. \u201cPatently, looking at the situation that Britain finds itself in now, as well as the Tory party, it was a horrendous mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cHe took the one thing that divided the Tory party and managed to put it centre stage.\n\n\u201cThe campaign was far too negative. It was quite staid, elitist, well-to-do. It needed to reach out far more to younger voters and talk about their opportunities, their futures. Instead they just played Ukip at their own game and lost.\u201d\n\nIn the book Cameron says that he is \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for the uncertainty and division that had followed the 2016 referendum, and in his first interview he suggested a second poll might be necessary. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can rule it out, because we\u2019re stuck,\u201d he told the Times.\n\nThe hardline Brexiter and former cabinet minister John Redwood said Cameron risked deepening national divides by wading back into the Brexit debate, and that he should be proud of having called the referendum, not ashamed of it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept that,\u201d he said when asked about Cameron\u2019s claim that Vote Leave lied. \u201cI don\u2019t really think David Cameron reopening arguments in the referendum campaign is helping achieve what he says he wants to achieve, which is the country settling down again and accepting the decision it has made,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme.\n\nCameron detailed his regrets about losing the referendum, but refused to apologise for calling the poll, and said that renegotiating Britain\u2019s EU membership and holding a referendum was the \u201cright approach\u201d. However, the former prime minister\u2019s re-emergence has unleashed a fresh debate about his role in the Brexit impasse and his motives for holding the referendum, including among many who were once close to him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Gove and Boris Johnson at a Vote Leave press conference in 2016.

Conservative MEP and hardline Brexit supporter Daniel Hannan tweeted: \u201cEveryone agrees that David Cameron made a terrible blunder by holding a referendum. Everyone except, you know, the general population.\u201d\n\nSir Malcolm Rifkind, the former defence secretary, said that an EU referendum had become inevitable. He said Cameron\u2019s major mistake had been promising to renegotiate EU membership without any guarantees that he would secure major concessions. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a question of Cameron being right or wrong \u2013 I don\u2019t think he had much choice and was unlucky on the timing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has always been a bit of a gambler. The gambling worked in the Scottish referendum and not in this one.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s revelation that he smoked cannabis at school and later with his wife, Samantha, drew criticism over his perceived failures on Britain\u2019s drugs policy.\n\nLabour MP David Lammy asked why he had not used his time in power to change laws that penalised many young people for the same drug use Cameron wrote about in his memoir.\n\n\u201cListen stoner why didn\u2019t you use your privilege to do something about the working class young people who have ended up banged up, jobless and with a criminal record for smoking weed like you,\u201d Lammy wrote on Twitter.", "description": "Former PM vents fury in his memoirs at his old colleagues over their stance on Brexit", "authors": ["Michael Savage", "Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0041dbae7d789b2f6f7caf4fa6e728c1754f3e04/0_134_4530_2718/master/4530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4ae5b115699ed158184effb4ec12524", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
