If you hate Khabib and his team, why do you say bad things about people?\u2019\n\nThe former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion attempted to explain his actions, saying: \u2018The disrespect they showed me in the build up to the fight, they sold items in the grocery with my face on it\u2026\u2019\n\nConor McGregor is not a popular man in Dagestan (Picture: TASS via Getty Images)\n\nThis did not appease the volatile chap, though, who shouted: \u2018All the people? My father, my brother, you think are all cowards?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcGregor was not for backing down, simply repeating: \u2018Yes, yes, yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why cowards? My father?! What did he do to you?! My brother, what did he do to you?!\u2019 the Dagestani shouted before hurling a bottle at McGregor and being bundled away by security.\n\nThe Irishman did not seem overly concerned by the verbal and physical attack, ducking out of the way of the bottle then continuing to take questions.\n\nThe 31-year-old announced on Thursday that he will return to fight in the UFC in January, having not fought since October of last year.\n\n\u2018I have agreed the date with the company,\u2019 McGregor said.\n\n\u2018As far as the opponent, I have the opponent\u2019s name, but from experience if I know if I give you the name the UFC would flip it. They are a crafty company. \u2018Ask the UFC who the opponent is because I do not give a f*** who the opponent is.\n\n\u2018January 18th, the return of the Notorious Conor McGregor, 12 weeks from today at the T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada. That will be the beginning of my season.\n\n\u2018I will then look to compete against the winner of the Nate Diaz-Jorge Masvidal for the Bad Motherf***er title.\n\n\u2018Obviously I have history with Nate Diaz and we are set to make the trilogy bout. I feel Nate will get the better of that one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Then I will seek the Moscow bout. It will be against the winner of Tony Ferguson and Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t even say the guy\u2019s name, who gives a f*** what the guy\u2019s name is. That is the bout we want. We want the bout in Russia.\u2019\n\nMORE: Conor McGregor announces UFC return in January and Nate Diaz trilogy fight in 2020\n\nMORE: Dan Hardy advises Conor McGregor to take Dustin Poirier fight and avoid Justin Gaethje", "description": "Conor McGregor was forced to duck as an enraged Dagestani threw a water bottle at him during a press conference in Moscow.
