Johnson, who is of mixed race, was on the mat and in uniform before a match on Dec. 19, 2018 when he was ordered by a white referee, Alan Maloney, to have his dreadlocks cut off or be barred from competing in the wrestling tournament.\n\nMaloney determined that Johnson could not wrestle without a hair cover, citing a National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rule that places restrictions on the length of an athlete\u2019s hair and when an athlete must wear a hair cover. The rule had previously been interpreted by various New Jersey wrestling officials to require a hair covering for several traditionally black hairstyles regardless of hair length but the teenager was not able to locate a hair cover that met the rules\u2019 specifications, according to a press release by the state's attorney general.\n\nNEW JERSEY REFEREE WHO FORCED WRESTLER TO CUT DREADLOCKS BEFORE MATCH IS UNDER INVESTIGATION\n\nJohnson, who appeared visibly upset in the video and received high fives from other teammates and wrestlers present, opted for the impromptu haircut and went on to win the match.\n\nThe video sparked outrage from many, with Olympic gold medalist Jordan Burroughs calling the incident \"an abuse of power, racism, and just plain negligence.\"\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Joint Agreement brings an end to our investigation of the December 19, 2018 incident at Buena Regional High School. The NJSIAA Task Force, working cooperatively with the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, thoroughly investigated the facts of that day\u2019s incident, as well as the language and interpretation of the wrestling hair-length rules,\" NJSIAA executive director Larry White said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the investigation, those rules have changed. We are confident that those changes, together with the training programs NJSIAA will be developing in collaboration with DCR, will ensure that a situation like this does not happen in the future.\n\n\u201cThe NJSIAA\u2019s mission includes fostering a safe and healthy playing environment for student-athletes, providing training for school administrators, coaches and officials, and making sure that rules promote fair play. Today\u2019s Joint Agreement helps advance each of those goals.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the referee's suspension, NJSIAA will provide implicit bias training to all high school sports officials in New Jersey.\n\nThe DCR also issued new training materials titled \u201cGuidance on Race Discrimination Based on Hairstyle,\u201d which specifically stipulates that any policy that bans, limits or restricts hairstyles \u201cinextricably intertwined with or closely associated with race,\u201d such as twists or locs may violate New Jersey law.\n\n\u201cDiscrimination against Black people because of their hair, which is often based on stereotypes that traditionally Black hairstyles are \u2019unprofessional\u2018 or \u2019unkempt,\u2019 is a persistent form of anti-Black racism,\u201d DCR director Rachel Wainer Apter said in a statement. \u201cThis guidance makes clear that employers, housing providers and places of public accommodation cannot police Black hair. And the MOA will ensure that high school athletes across the State can focus on being their best, not worrying that their hair will subject them to differential treatment based on race. We are grateful to the NJSIAA for their hard work on this Agreement.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAttorney General Gurbir Grewal also condemned racism of any kind saying \u201cStudent athletes should be able to compete with each other on a level playing field.\"\n\n\"Racial discrimination in the enforcement of the rules of any sport is inconsistent with the spirit of fair play. The Division on Civil Rights\u2019 action today makes it less likely that any student athlete will have to endure discrimination that not only undermines fair competition but also violates our state laws.\u201d", "description": "A New Jersey high school referee was handed a two-year suspension on Wednesday after he forced a teenaged wrestler to cut off his dreadlocks moments before a match to avoid forfeiting it.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
