Cloudflare is also launching a paid version, Warp Plus, that uses Cloudflare\u2019s Argo technology, which promises additional speed and security.\n\nCloudflare\u2019s goal for Warp is to make a mobile VPN that not only makes browsing more secure, but also faster. And, since it\u2019s a VPN for your phone, it should make any internet traffic from your phone more secure, too. However, you can\u2019t use Warp to spoof your location \u2014 you\u2019ll need to use another VPN if you want to watch your favorite show that\u2019s not on the US version of Netflix.\n\nThere were approximately 2 million people on the Warp waitlist\n\nCloudflare says there were \u201capproximately two million people\u201d on the waitlist for Warp. The company adds that it wanted to launch Warp in July, but the release took longer than expected. \u201cIt turned out that building a next generation service to secure consumer mobile connections without slowing them down or burning battery was\u2026 harder than we originally thought,\u201d writes CEO Matthew Prince in a blog post.\n\nIn my own testing of the free version of Warp, I haven\u2019t felt any noticeable changes to my internet speeds or battery life. According to Cloudflare, that free version has no bandwidth caps or \u201climitations,\u201d and I haven\u2019t noticed any particular slowdowns. That said, if you want the additional speed and security benefits of Warp Plus, you\u2019ll have to pay $4.99 a month in the US. Cloudflare says the price will vary by region.\n\nIf you were on the waitlist, Cloudflare says it will give you 10GB of Warp Plus, but some commenters on the announcement blog and on Reddit haven\u2019t seen that show up yet. If you haven\u2019t, Cloudfare is advising you to send a bug report in the app by tapping on the little insect icon on the top of the screen. If you recently switched phones, though, you might be out of luck \u2014 Cloudflare says your waitlist number was tied to your individual device.", "description": "Cloudflare has rolled out its free Warp VPN to its 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver mobile app for all users after announcing it in April.
