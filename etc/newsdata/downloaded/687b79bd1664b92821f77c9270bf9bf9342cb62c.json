They\u2019re called the \u2018Joker Stairs\u2019 now, and apparently come up on Google as a \u201creligious destination\u201d.\n\nI regret to inform you that the influencers are at it again.\n\n\u2018Step Street\u2019 in the Highbridge area of South Bronx is being swarmed by insta nerds who want to recreate the film\u2019s poster, trailer, and huge scene, where Phoenix\u2019s Joker is dancing down the stairs to a tune produced by an awful man who I refuse to name.\n\nLooks something a little like this:\n\nAnyway because absolutely nothing is good and sacred anymore, the stairs are being inundated by folks yearning to get The Perfect Shot\u2122, which is drawing the ire and mild owning of the Bronx locals.\n\nThe pics, they look a little something like this:\n\n????I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it\u2019s a comedy ???? I whipped up a female Joker in about 2 days just so I could shoot on the iconic stairs! ????\u2764\ufe0f This amazing set will be going live soon\n\nPhotos by @rongejon #Jokerstairs #Joker #jokermovie pic.twitter.com/qWY6h2AF44 \u2014 Veronica Rae (@VeronicaRaex) October 15, 2019\n\nLocals are retaliating by reminding folks that are deadset on wanting to visit the Joker stairs to see the filming location that the South Bronx area can get really bloody rough, and that robberies are pretty common in the area. But like, anything for the \u2018gram, right?\n\nIf y\u2019all keep going to \u201cthe joker stairs\u201d y\u2019all gonna end up getting robbed and ya ass beat and really look like a clown, watch. pic.twitter.com/qMG9vhatGJ \u2014 The Lord ???? (@KalelFelder) October 18, 2019\n\nWhy are they promoting the stairs on West 167th in the Bronx as a tourist location? Just because the Joker danced down them in a movie?! White folks, that's a sure fire way to get robbed at gunpoint! Those stairs are legendary\u2026 For criminal activity. ???????????? \u2014 Ashley Banks hit single (@IamLeoBitches) October 20, 2019\n\nthis isn\u2019t even a joke but seriously don\u2019t visit \u201cJoker Stairs\u201d you will get robbed or someone will throw garbage on you LMAO \u2014 Z ????
