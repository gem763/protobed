The Western community with a charming main street dates back to 1859 when people moved here to ranch. Around the turn of the century, due to Evergreen\u2019s proximity to the state capital, city folks started migrating to the region to build summer homes and hunting cabins. After an alpine reservoir was filled in 1928 to create Evergreen Lake, the area increased in notoriety. Today houses still sit on ample acreage, and wildlife\u2014like elk and bears\u2014is omnipresent. This gives the town of about 9,000 people a middle-of-nowhere vibe despite being only roughly 30 to 40 minutes from both downtown Denver and popular ski areas further west. It\u2019s one of just a few foothill enclaves that has not changed drastically over the years, meaning despite its glitzy residents, Evergreen remains real as it gets.\n\nEvergreen\u2019s charming main street dates back to 1859 when people moved here to ranch.

Famous acts have included Willie Nelson, Neil Young and Gregg Allman.\n\nMountain Home\n\nThis interior design store sells home furnishings and accessories that have a cabin aesthetic. The shop, housed in a barn that was built in 1942, was recently purchased by local interior designer Alexa Cowley; her firm now operates out of the space.\n\nRevival Brews\n\nLocated in a rustic building dating back to the late 1800s, this no-frills (in the best way) restaurant offers a rotating tap list of beers and homemade pub fare. Evergreen residents congregate here after a day outdoors.\n\nEvergreen Crafters\n\nThis is the place to go for Colorado art, jewelry, wind chimes, and local, one-of-a-kind gift items shoppers can\u2019t find anywhere else. It\u2019s been serving the mountain community since 1948.\n\nIllustration: Shaw Nielsen\n\nEvent of the year\n\nThe Evergreen Rodeo, with roots dating back to 1935, takes place every Father\u2019s Day weekend. It\u2019s a blow-out event that includes a parade with more than 100 participants (marching bands, floats, horses, antique cars) passing through downtown.\n\nMembership to have\n\nFounded in 1962, the Hiwan Golf Club has an 18-hole golf course and a pool. Non-golfer members join just so they can use the latter.\n\nAdvice for the buyer\n\nUpper Bear Creek Road, in a small canyon with a creek running through it, is one of the prime spots to buy in Evergreen; many of the most fabulous houses on this street rarely change hands. For buyers looking for horse properties, Evergreen is also full of barns and arenas.\n\nOn the market\n\n5 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms Photo: Rob Larsen\n\n$2.795 million\n\nA Chalet-style house, this 7,456-square-foot property has vaulted ceilings with big picture windows and a wraparound deck that provide views of the estate\u2019s 15 wooded acres, which include a fenced horse pasture.
