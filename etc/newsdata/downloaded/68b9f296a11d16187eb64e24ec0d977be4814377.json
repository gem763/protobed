Gary Peters is eager to determine the frequency of military overnights at the golf resort. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo defense Senator seeks independent probe of military\u2019s use of Trump resort\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has formally requested an independent investigation into the Air Force\u2019s increased use of a commercial airport in Scotland and overnight stays at the Trump Turnberry resort.\n\n\u201cI am disturbed by the growing number of those in government willing to engage in questionable taxpayer funded travel to and lodging at properties owned by the president \u2014 properties from which President Trump can draw income at any time,\u201d Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Glenn Fine, who is fulfilling the duties of the Pentagon inspector general.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve an independent inquiry into the Air Force\u2019s increasingly frequent visits to Prestwick Airport, as well as answers to how many of those visits involved stays at Trump Turnberry by military personnel,\u201d Peters added in the letter, first obtained by POLITICO.\n\nThe Air Force is already conducting a review of its refueling and lodging practices following the revelations that Air Force personnel have been using the struggling Glasgow Prestwick Airport more frequently over the last several years to refuel and at least in several instances stayed at Trump\u2019s seaside resort more than 30 miles away.\n\nPOLITICO, which was first to report the practice, also revealed that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been investigating the stopovers since April. Earlier Tuesday, the panel threatened to subpoena Pentagon officials if they failed to respond to a June 21 letter seeking documents on the use of the airport, including $11 million spent on fuel since 2017.\n\nAccusations that Trump\u2019s properties are unfairly profiting off of his administration have dogged the president since entering office. Ethics officials and lawmakers have raised concerns about foreign officials staying at Trump hotels, and noted that Trump supporters and industry groups regularly throw bashes at Trump-owned locations. Trump is also considering hosting next year\u2019s Group of Seven gathering of world leaders at his Doral resort in Florida, a potential financial boon for the property, and has previously stayed at the Turnberry property.\n\nThe Air Force has said the stops are within Pentagon guidelines and noted that the Turnberry bookings, in some instances orchestrated by a local travel service, fall within acceptable rates for military travel. But the Air Force also conceded that the appearance of staying at the president\u2019s property might create a negative perception.\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

Damien Pickart, the chief spokesperson for the Air Mobility Command, told POLITICO in a statement.\n\nAnother Air Force official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the task requires reviewing travel vouchers individually and estimated that it would require \u201chundreds of man-hours.\u201d\n\nPeters is eager to determine the frequency of military overnights at the golf resort, not just the total number of airport stops and overnights.\n\n\u201cI am troubled that this information was not provided until news reports revealed the Air Force\u2019s approvals of stays at Turnberry,\u201d the senator added in his letter to the Pentagon inspector general. \u201c \u2026 I find it hard to believe the Air Force was capable of reporting the exact number of trips to Prestwick, but, according to the Deputy head of Air Mobility Command, the Air Force \u2018could not report how many of these overnights may have been at Trump Turnberry.\u2019\u201d\n\nPeters also insisted that the answers were important in order to put to rest any doubts that the Air Force is inappropriately enriching the president\u2019s businesses.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces are charged with the critical duty of defending our nation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey protect our most important values and are charged with representing them as well. Potentially unnecessary spending by the military at a for-profit business owned by the President raises serious concerns about conflicts of interest and threatens the trust that the American people have placed in our military.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon IG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe House and Senate are also considering a proposal passed by the House in July that would make it illegal for the Pentagon to spend taxpayer dollars at Trump-owned properties.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier headline on this report misstated Sen.
