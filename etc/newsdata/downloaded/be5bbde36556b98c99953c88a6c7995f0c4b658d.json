But as his many scandals unfold, one of the things becoming clear is the way Trump\u2019s corruption spreads \u2014 through the government, through the Republican Party and in some ways through the country itself.\n\nIn both the Ukraine scandal and the emerging scandal over Trump\u2019s tax returns, we\u2019re seeing how even Trump\u2019s loyal aides and advocates assume he has the worst motives and intentions, then make their own decisions accordingly.\n\nThere may be dissenters here and there, and even some who take the risk of blowing the whistle. But not even his most devoted lickspittles believe Trump wants them to act ethically and in accordance with the law and the interests of the United States.\n\nIn the case of the IRS whistleblower, we\u2019re seeing another example of how Trump\u2019s underlings assume the worst about him \u2014 which is never an inaccurate assumption \u2014 and then act on his desires, without needing to be told explicitly what he wants and expects. Here\u2019s the latest:\n\nAn Internal Revenue Service \u00adofficial has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president\u2019s or vice president\u2019s tax returns, according to multiple people familiar with the document. Trump administration officials dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as flimsy because it is based on conversations with other government officials. But congressional Democrats were alarmed by the complaint, now circulating on Capitol Hill, and flagged it in a federal court filing. They are also discussing whether to make it public.\n\nAside from the allegation of improper interference, we know almost no details about this complaint, other than that it alleges that \u201cpolitical appointees may have tried to interfere with the government audit process, which was set up to be insulated from political pressures,\u201d in The Post\u2019s description.\n\nOur reporters spoke to the whistleblower himself, but he refused to discuss the substance of the complaint; instead, he spoke only about the importance of protecting whistleblowing.\n\nBut just based on the broad allegation \u2014 that Treasury Department officials attempted to interfere in the routine audit of the president or vice president\u2019s tax returns \u2014 we can surmise a good deal about what likely went on.\n\nTrump clearly believes that if his tax returns were ever made public, the political fallout would be catastrophic. To prevent that from ever happening, he has lied repeatedly about the matter (claiming over and over that he would soon release them when he obviously never had any intention of doing so) and filed lawsuits trying to prevent congressional subpoenas for those returns from being honored. As The Post reported in April, he has told aides \"he would fight the issue to the Supreme Court, hoping to stall it until after the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nJust as clearly, the people who work for Trump also believe the public release of his returns would be a disaster. They have acted on that belief, taking cues from the president without ever having to be told explicitly what a critical priority keeping the returns secret is.\n\nSo for instance, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testified in May that he has never spoken with Trump or anyone else in the White House about it; he decided to violate the law and refuse to honor a congressional demand for Trump\u2019s returns all on his own.\n\nI believe him. I also believe that Trump didn\u2019t have to order Attorney General William P. Barr to have the Justice Department join a lawsuit seeking to prevent investigators from getting Trump\u2019s returns from his accounting firm. Barr, who has shown there\u2019s almost nothing he won\u2019t do to protect Trump, no matter how dishonest or unethical, knew just what was required.\n\nIf the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is accurate, some official or officials in the Treasury Department decided to intervene in what is supposed to be a routine process carried out by IRS professionals. The danger presented by that audit was apparently too great. You would do that only if you feared the truth, that carrying out the audit according to standard procedures would reveal wrongdoing or perhaps even criminal behavior.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait for details to understand this matter more fully. But the analogy to the Ukraine scandal is inescapable. When White House officials heard Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine, they immediately knew that if it became public, it would be a disaster, so they placed records of the call in a secure system meant to prevent access from all but a tiny number of officials. Trump didn\u2019t order them to do it; he didn\u2019t have to, because the stakes were obvious. That Trump had abused his office they had no doubt.\n\nNo one else does, either \u2014 not career professionals in the government, not Trump\u2019s own aides, not the Republican officeholders leaping into elevators to avoid reporters\u2019 questions about him, and certainly not the rest of us. We\u2019ve all known all along. Now we have to decide if he\u2019ll be held accountable.\n\nRead more:\n\nCatherine Rampell: There\u2019s another whistleblower complaint.
