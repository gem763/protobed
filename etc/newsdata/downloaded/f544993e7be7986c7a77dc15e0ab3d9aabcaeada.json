I loved all his designs and when he showed me this dress, I thought it was the perfect thing to wear for my 21st birthday party. It\u2019s amazing that it has become so iconic; everybody wants to wear it. I feel proud every time I see someone wearing a version of this look. When I moved to New York, I would always wear these outfits that stood out \u2013 no one was dressing that way \u2013 and now I see them everywhere. I love being a fashionista, it\u2019s amazing to start trends and to see my picture on moodboards.\n\nEverything that Macdonald makes looks like it would be uncomfortable because it\u2019s so intricate and crystalised, but his pieces are of such amazing quality that they are easy to wear. I love that he designs clothes that make you feel confident and beautiful.\n\nGrowing up, I always had my own sense of style. I loved being unique and original and coming up with my own trends. I love the way Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham dress \u2013 they always look so chic and stylish. When I go to a party, I love to be glamorous and go all out; I like to sparkle and feel amazing. However, my everyday wear is very comfortable. I love Juicy Couture\u2019s velour tracksuits; I probably own 100 of them in every colour. That\u2019s my uniform when I\u2019m chilling at home or going to the beach \u2013 anything that doesn\u2019t involve a red carpet.\n\nI do have a signature look \u2013 I love pink and I love sparkles \u2013 but my style has changed over the years. I have been really influenced by my sister Nicky, whose style has always been the complete opposite of mine. I\u2019ve learned to tone it down a little bit, be a little bit more understated sometimes. But it depends on the situation; I\u2019m a chameleon. I can show up in a Chanel suit, looking like a businesswoman, but if I\u2019m at a party or Halloween or Burning Man, then I\u2019m going all out.\n\nParis Hilton\u2019s 25th fragrance, Electrify, is available in the US and is coming to Europe in January 2020.", "description": "The hotel heiress on her 21st birthday party outfit, her vast collection of leisurewear and becoming a more understated dresser", "authors": ["Leah Harper", "As Told To"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e417044cddf7c952ea51361a757b6186c9ab3414/0_347_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=316124b42fd3a188f5776596042c640c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
