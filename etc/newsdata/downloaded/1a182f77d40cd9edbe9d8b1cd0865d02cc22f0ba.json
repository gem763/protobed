And then that\u2019s when one of my friends sent us the link to the video and we realized not only were we not in it, but there were no students of color in it, really at all.\u201d\n\nWade took to both Facebook and Twitter to express her disappointment, posting a recording of the since-deleted video itself.\n\nAs if being on a campus where you are unwanted and have to fight every day just to survive and make it isn\u2019t bad enough @UWMadison is back at it again reminding us that we don\u2019t belong here and that there is no room for Black students here. #SurvivingUW #HomeIsWhite #TheRealUW pic.twitter.com/7dTzAs4TRm \u2014 \ud83d\udc51 Payton \ud83d\udc51 (@payton_renee_) September 30, 2019\n\nHere is the video the @UWMadison homecoming committee posted pic.twitter.com/5rSbf4wgE9 \u2014 \ud83d\udc51 Payton \ud83d\udc51 (@payton_renee_) September 30, 2019\n\n\u201cBeing Black at this school is a daily struggle both mentally and physically,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cIt is hard to have pride for a school where you know you are not wanted and where they obviously do not consider this our home as well. I am disappointed in this university once again, but I am not surprised.\u201d\n\nWade explains that she considered transferring out of UW-Madison her freshman year after experiencing micro-aggressions in her dorm. She even had one encounter with a resident assistant there who told her, \u201cIf you want to keep living here, you\u2019re gonna have to get it together. I know people like you are loud.\u201d\n\nA 2015 graduate, Anthony Wright \u2014 who also posted about the video on Twitter \u2014 tells Yahoo Lifestyle that he\u2019s in disbelief to see the problems he faced years ago persisting. \u201cMarginalized students are still fighting to have their UW experience included in the story of the university,\u201d Wright says. \u201cThe fact that the university gave this group the chance to be a part of this story and chose to not feature it for whatever reason, is counter to the diverse and inclusive narrative it pushes.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin homecoming committee posted an apology to its Facebook page on Monday evening. In it, the committee took responsibility for the images that were omitted from the final feature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Alumni Association, which sponsors the student committee, also addressed the video with a statement that reads: \u201cWe apologize that the video produced by the committee gave only a partial representation of the UW-Madison student body. WAA is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion and will listen to our student, alumni, and campus partners on ways to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe university also published an apology to both students and alumni for the pain caused by the video.\n\n\u201cWe know that, both historically and today, students of color and other under-represented groups do not feel as welcome on our campus as majority students. As a community, we must commit to and invest in ways to change this. One important way is to ensure active participation and authentic involvement by Badgers of many different identities in all aspects of campus life. Unfortunately, as the student Homecoming Committee and the Wisconsin Alumni Association have acknowledged, a student video promoting Homecoming failed to do this,\u201d the statement reads in part.", "description": "Students of color at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are speaking out about being excluded from a video touting a diverse student body.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mbyKeRuCUdd1YlnEtpVjog--~B/aD0xMTU0O3c9MTM4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/911dc070-e455-11e9-b7b1-2ab5a491b1bc", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
