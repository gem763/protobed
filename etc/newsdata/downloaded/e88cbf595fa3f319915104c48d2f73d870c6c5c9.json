The Cubs, who had won their last six road games, remained 2\u00bd back of NL Central-leading St. Louis, which lost 9-4 at Pittsburgh.\n\nYelich had the big blow in the Brewers\u2019 four-run third inning, hitting a three-run drive to right-center. Cory Spangenberg added a run-scoring bunt single off Cole Hamels, giving Milwaukee a 4-1 lead.\n\nYelich\u2019s homer tied him with Cody Bellinger of the Dodgers, one behind NL leader Pete Alonso of the Mets.\n\nDavies (9-7) allowed one run - Nicholas Castellanos\u2019 24th homer in the third - and three hits in his first win since July 18. The right-hander went 0-5 with a 7.76 ERA in his previous six starts.\n\nDavies almost picked up a win in his previous outing, but he was pulled after pitching 4 2/3 innings in the Brewers\u2019 2-0 victory over the Cubs last weekend.\n\nBrent Suter retired all six batters he faced, Junior Guerra pitched a scoreless eighth and Ray Black finished with a perfect ninth.\n\nHamels (7-6) was tagged for five runs and nine hits in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nGrandal made it 5-1 in the fourth with his 24th homer. Orlando Arcia added a sacrifice fly in the seventh, and Ben Gamel singled in a run in the eighth.\n\nCastellanos\u2019 homer was his 13th in 33 games since he was acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCubs: All-Star SS Javier B\u00e1ez was scratched with lingering soreness in his left thumb. He will get an MRI on Saturday and likely will not play that day, manager Joe Maddon said. \u2026 Closer Craig Kimbrel said he hopes to return next week. He was placed on the 10-day injured list Thursday with elbow inflammation, retroactive to Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, very frustrating,\u201d he said.\n\nBrewers: C Manny Pi\u00f1a, who left Thursday\u2019s game after taking a foul ball off the mask, suffered a concussion, manager Craig Counsell said. He will miss at least a couple of games. C Jacob Nottingham was recalled from Triple-A San Antonio. \u2026 3B Mike Moustakas missed his third consecutive game because his sore left hand is \u201cnot making great progress,\u201d Counsell said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCubs: RHP Yu Darvish (5-6, 4.25 ERA), who missed his last turn with right forearm tightness, makes his first start since Aug. 27. He has 78 strikeouts and just three walks in his last 10 starts.\n\nBrewers: LHP Gio Gonz\u00e1lez (2-2, 4.14 ERA) is making his fifth start of the season against the Cubs. He is 1-0 with 1.40 ERA in his previous four starts against them.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Yelich hit his 44th homer and Zach Davies pitched five effective innings for his first win since July, helping the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs 7-1 on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Hoehn"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/cubs_brewers_baseball_43203_c0-226-3967-2538_s1770x1032.jpg?e8dfa10957d807247264363bc54d0e9aa7dda86e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
