In some ways, it\u2019s good that people are having a strong reaction to it.\u201d\n\nCritics have accused \u201cJoker\u201d of promoting real-world violence and painting the notorious supervillain as a hero. Earlier this month, families of the victims who were killed during a Batman movie at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 wrote a letter to Warner Bros. demanding that the studio donate profits to gun-victim charities.\n\nWarner Bros., as well as the film\u2019s director and executive producer, have all defended the film as necessary in provoking difficult conversations surrounding gun violence and mental health.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different ways of looking at it,\u201d Mr. Phoenix said. \u201cYou can either say here\u2019s somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. Or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. His satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.\n\n\u201cI was going through [the script] and I realized, I said, \u2018Well, why would we make something, like, where you sympathize or empathize with this villain?\u2019 It\u2019s, like, because that\u2019s what we have to do,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy for us to \u2014 we want the simple answers, we want to vilify people. It allows us to feel good if we can identify that as evil. \u2018Well, I\u2019m not racist \u2018cause I don\u2019t have a Confederate flag or go with this protest.\u2019 It allows us to feel that way, but that\u2019s not healthy because we\u2019re not really examining our inherent racism that most white people have, certainly. Or whatever it may be. Whatever issues you may have. It\u2019s too easy for us and I felt like, yeah, we should explore this villain. This malevolent person.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, \u201cJoker\u201d director Todd Phillips continued his defense of the film, saying people needed to remember that the Joker isn\u2019t a real person.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a movie about a fictional character in a fictional world, ultimately, and your hope is that people take it for what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame movies for a world that is so f\u2013ed up that anything can trigger it. That\u2019s kind of what the movie is about. It\u2019s not a call to action. If anything it\u2019s a call to self-reflection to society.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
