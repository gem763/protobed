But he had a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nOne of Ireland\u2019s neighbours said he was often in trouble with the police and: \u201cThis lad deserves everything he has coming to him.\u201d", "description": "Ewan Ireland admits killing Peter Duncan, 52, after the dad-of-two let him into the Newcastle mall in August", "authors": ["Tom Wilkinson", "Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "North News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469352.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Ewan-Ireland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
