Bush at a football game. USA TODAY\n\nBest friends show up and power through \u2013 even when the teleprompter crashes.\n\nOn Friday, Ellen DeGeneres surprised the crowd at the annual Variety Power of Women luncheon, appearing onstage to introduce honoree Jennifer Aniston. A ripple moved through the crowd when DeGeneres walked on stage, just days after her George W. Bush comments created a fracas online.\n\nBut DeGeneres steered away from those headlines, instead toasting Aniston's charity efforts for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and cracking jokes about the event's failed teleprompter.\n\n\"I'm fine (but) Jen is freaking out back there,\" DeGeneres joked. \"Play some music,\" she instructed the DJ, waiting for her speech to reprogram and appear on the podium's clear glass teleprompter (it never did). Then, to fill time, DeGeneres danced heartily onstage.\n\nHollywood reaction: Gwen Stefani, Mark Ruffalo and more split on Ellen DeGeneres, George W. Bush friendship\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Jennifer Aniston attend Variety's Power of Women presented by Lifetime on October 11.

Seriously, too nice sometimes,\" she said.\n\nLater, Aniston returned the joke. \"Ellen, we have to keep the best friend stuff on the DL. Because a lot of my best friends are here.\"\n\nEllen DeGeneres introduces Jen Aniston at @Variety#PowerofWomen luncheon.

Strong? Yes. But powerful? Not (really).\"\n\nAniston recalled being excused from the dinner table around the age of 11 \"because I didn't have anything interesting to add to the conversation. Ouch. It stuck with me ... I carried that sentence with me into adulthood.\"\n\nThe actress said it wasn't until \"Friends\" that she \"started seeing myself in a different light.\"\n\nOver the last two years, Aniston added, obliquely referencing the \"Me Too\" movement, \"has made me think a lot about the messages we send young kids, little girls especially. How the things that we say and do can either build them up or tear them down and make them feel like their voices don't matter.\"\n\nMore: Jennifer Aniston studied Matt Lauer's last 'Today' appearance for 'Morning Show' inspo\n\nAlso honored at the Audi-sponsored luncheon was Mariah Carey (for her philanthropic work with the Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah), Brie Larson (for her work with the Equal Justice Initiative), Awkwafina (Building Bears), Chaka Khan (Little Kids Rock) and ABC/Fox executive Dana Walden (UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center).\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/11/ellen-degeneres-emerges-pal-jennifer-aniston-after-bush-fracas/3947940002/", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres surprised at the Variety Power of Women luncheon just days after her George W.
