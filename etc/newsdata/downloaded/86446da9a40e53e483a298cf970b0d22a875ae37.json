He will be buried at Har Hamenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu, Gantz, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and other top officials attended Tuesday\u2019s public funeral and the prime minister delivered the eulogy.\n\n\u201cMeir\u2019s unique contribution to shaping the legal system is priceless,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cHis firm and consistent belief in freedom of speech, individual liberties and tolerance is reflected in every judgment he made, as is his recognition of the supreme importance of state security.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu and Gantz have been working to form a coalition government since their election victories last month. Netanyahu said Monday he couldn\u2019t find enough support, and the mandate to put together a working government was given to Gantz.\n\nShamgar is credited with shaping much of Israel\u2019s legal system as the Israeli Defense Force chief attorney and, later, its attorney general and Supreme Court justice and president. He developed the legal framework for Israel to occupy the West Bank, a decision that\u2019s been called the \u201cbelligerent occupation\u201d by Palestinians. Shamgar, however, also put significant limits on what Israel can do in the West Bank.\n\nHe founded the IDF West Bank Court system to handle Palestinian crimes. And Palestinians could appeal court rulings to the Supreme Court even though they weren\u2019t officially citizens. He served as Supreme Court chief justice for 12 years, the longest in Israeli history, and extended the court\u2019s power to review various government and Knesset decisions.\n\n\u201cPresident Shamgar is a key figure in Israeli law,\u201d Justice Aharon Barak said. \u201cHe is a cornerstone of Israel\u2019s judicial history. The reality is that the judicial creation is a continuum that in which every just adds a link to the never-ending chain, and Shamgar likely added one of the most important of these links. On foundations laid by his predecessors, he built new and original structures, laying the base for new developments in Israeli law.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1925 in Danzig, Poland, to Russian-born parents who were members of the Revisionist Party, a young Shamgar belonged to the Beitar youth movement in Nazi-occupied Poland. He fought for the Irgun and was arrested by British forces in 1944. He later studied law by correspondence while in jail and, upon his release, completed his studies in history and philosophy at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz attended a memorial service Tuesday for former Israeli", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
