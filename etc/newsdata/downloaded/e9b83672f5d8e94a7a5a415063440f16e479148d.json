Our own president has shared this view a number of times in interviews.\n\nWe have many squatter camps where people of all races live who are very poor. You do not see all of them going around robbing and murdering people. In fact, why must you kill someone if you are hungry?\n\nFact of the matter is that it is only a small portion of the population who participates in these actions. The majority of black, white, Indian and brown people in squatter camps do not take part in these actions. Are they not hungry and unemployed?\n\nSome people go around burning and stoning other people\u2019s property when they are not happy. The police stand and watch and do nothing. The reason these people act in this manner is because they have no respect for other people. How can you justify destroying other people\u2019s property because you are not happy? Do you think it makes them happy if you do this? If actions like these make you happy, you are very sick.\n\nIn the last few weeks we have had actions where violence against women and children has been addressed. Is the problem not rather that violence in this country has become an everyday occurrence?\n\nCrime in this country has become a way of living for some people.\n\nYou cannot blame hunger for this as there are more hungry people who do not take part in crime.\n\nWe need the government to start acting on crime and stop making excuses for these criminals.\n\nOr is it perhaps that they have lost control of the crime situation in this country?", "description": "We have many squatter camps where people of all races live who are very poor.
