The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT.\n\n\"They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.\"\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nThe eight-minute footage also shows toxicology tests being carried out on cats, dogs and rabbits, leaving them in a highly distressed state.\n\nAccording to CFI, the tests involve poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a \u2018safe\u2019 dose for humans might be.\n\nThey claim the animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects.\n\nThe horrific effects include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nCFI claim animals are not given pain relief or anaesthetics.\n\nThe undercover worker said staff are not trained animal carers and were often violent towards the animals.\n\nThey said they witnessed beagles bleeding after the experiments in which pipes forced were down their throat as they were given capsules.\n\nMichelle Thew, CFI chief executive, is calling for the laws to be changed.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nHe said: \"Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law.\n\n\"We are calling for LPT to be closed.\n\n\"We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK.\n\n\"Every investigation, without fail, shows a similar tale of misery and disregard of the law.\"\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nAn online petition has been launched by activist Carolin Iding that calls for LPT to be shut down.\n\nIt says: \"The recent research by the SOKO Animal Welfare to LPT shows again in horrible pictures and video recordings that in my city animals are tortured and maltreated.\n\nWhen I think about how animals are suffering behind the walls of the LPT right now and experiencing hell on earth right now, everything in me contracts.\n\n\"No living thing deserves to be treated like that and die like that!\"\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nSo far it has gained more than 41,000 signatures since it was launched on October 11.\n\nLPT is a family-owned company that carries out toxicity testing for pharmaceutical, industrial and agro-chemical companies globally to ensure products meet the requirements of governments and regulatory authorities.\n\nMirror Online has contacted LPT for a comment.", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING FOOTAGE - The upsetting footage, taken at a lab in Hamburg, also shows cats and dogs that appear to be bleeding", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Cruelty Free International"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584470.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL-Monkeys-scream-out-in-pain-in-secret-footage-recorded-at-German-lab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
