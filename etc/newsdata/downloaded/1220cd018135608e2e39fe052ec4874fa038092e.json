A handful of the State Department\u2019s career employees are in revolt, testifying to Congress that elements in and around the administration are engaged in rogue diplomacy. Congress is uniformly opposed to Trump\u2019s foreign policy in Syria, and Republicans have broken away in droves.\n\nYet here, in this capital city, the Trump administration was able to notch a modest victory: a temporary end to the bloodshed in Syria. Over more than four hours of negotiations \u2014 some 90 minutes of which was Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan one on one \u2014 the two sides agreed to a pause in violence for 120 hours so that Kurdish forces could withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border. The United States agreed it would hold off on new sanctions, and remove existing sanctions.\n\nErdogan is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 22 \u2014 exactly five days from now.\n\nIn some sense, the bar was set quite low. The United States is not reengaging militarily in Syria, Pence said, speaking from the American ambassador\u2019s residence here. He put his modest charge this way: \u201cPresident Trump sent us here to end the violence and to achieve an immediate cease-fire. Thanks to the agreement that we negotiated today and the strong stand that President Trump took, in the preceding days, we've achieved that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where everybody is happy\" \u2014 Donald Trump, U.S. president\n\nThe president, speaking in Texas ahead of a political rally, was far more expansive. He hailed the deal as \u201can amazing outcome\" that saved \"millions and millions of lives.\"\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where everybody is happy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Kurds are very happy. Turkey is very happy. The United States is very happy. And, you know what? Civilization is very happy. It\u2019s a great thing for civilization.\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally who had stridently criticized the president's handling of the Turkish intervention, called the deal \"real progress\" and a \"breakthough,\" though he did not pull a proposed sanctions bill co-sponsored by Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\n\nBut Middle East analysts were less impressed. \"This is more than Turkey ever wanted from the U.S.,\" said Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Center for Global Policy. \"At least since 2015, Turkey had tried to get American concessions over specific towns, like Manbij and Raqqa. This is a wholesale concession. Erdogan without a doubt got more than he bargained for: the end of the Kurdish project and the U.S. withdrawal in northern Syria.\"\n\nOnly 24 hours earlier, Trump\u2019s gambit to send Pompeo and Pence to Ankara had alarmed some in the administration.\n\nTheir charge was to notch a cease-fire with Erdo\u011fan, the man who started the conflict in northern Syria and showed no desire to end it. In public statements, he rejected the notion of a cease-fire, and there was fear in the administration that Pence would head home and Pompeo go on to Jerusalem empty-handed. And, by that narrow measure, the nine-hour trip to Turkey was successful.\n\nOver the next five days, Turkey will halt its military operations while the YPG \u2014 the Kurdish military group whose muscle was crucial to crushing the Islamic State \u2014 leaves the safe zone. The Syrian Defense Forces are already leaving the Syrian border region, Pence said. Turkey will not engage militarily in Kobani, a Kurdish-majority Syrian city whose desperate stand against ISIS was where the U.S. alliance with Syria\u2019s Kurds was forged in blood.\n\nAccording to a fact sheet passed out to reporters, the U.S. also reaffirmed Turkey\u2019s good standing in NATO, a subject of heated commentary back in Washington, and the two countries committed to preserving Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nThere were some small signs for hope all day. Pence and Erdogan held the first meeting one on one, with envoy Jim Jeffrey \u2014 a longtime Middle East hand \u2014 serving as the translator for the U.S. side. The meeting was scheduled to last for just 10 minutes, aides said, but it stretched to nearly an hour and a half.\n\nAfterward, reporters were escorted into a conference room where Erdo\u011fan and his advisers were meeting Pence, Pompeo and their team. U.S. officials made sure to note that this mere fact \u2014 American reporters entering the inner chambers of the Turkish president \u2014 was monumental in and of itself.\n\nAt around 7:15 p.m. in Ankara, four hours after Pence and Pompeo entered the presidential palace, the Turks started to bring food for hungry aides and reporters.\n\n\"We can bring certainly most of our people back home for the first time in many years\" \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nBut almost immediately, Turkish crews began setting up cameras. And Pence and Pompeo were readying to leave the palace for the ambassador\u2019s residence to announce the framework of the agreement.\n\nPence and Pompeo took a handful of questions from reporters before yielding the spotlight to Trump, who praised their efforts \u2014 and his own \u2014 upon landing in Fort Worth.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the thing I\u2019m most happy about,\u201d he said, was the speed of the agreement. \u201cI took a lot of heat, but that we were able to do it so fast. I thought this would go on for longer. This was such a smart thing to get it done so fast.\u201d\n\nAnd he insisted that the \u201cunconventional\u201d deal wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the dramatic events of recent days.\n\n\u201cTurkey wouldn't have done this three days ago,\u201d he said. The Kurds would not have done it three days ago. This is a situation where everybody is happy. And I\u2019m happy, because there\u2019s no fighting. We can bring certainly most of our people back home for the first time in many years.\u201d", "description": "Despite long odds and a spiraling impeachment inquiry in Washington, the president\u2019s top lieutenants notched him a provisional win in Ankara.", "authors": ["Jake Sherman", "Quint Forgey", "Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176382360-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
