But most of the rise in support is from Democrats, Trump and Republicans are now beginning to fight back.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House sent a letter to House Democrats slamming the impeachment inquiry as an \u201cillegitimate\u201d and \u201cpartisan\u201d effort to undo the 2016.\n\n\u201cThe President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch from their work on behalf of the American people,\u201d White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally Thursday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump called it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201cinsane,\u201d and warned an attempt to overthrow him would produce backlash at the ballot box.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) shared with Republican lawmakers this week an internal poll that showed that in 95 battleground districts, 67 percent of independents viewed impeachment as politically motivated.\n\nThe poll found that a Republican candidate who opposes impeachment leads a pro-impeachment Democrat 50 percent to 42 percent in the poll. It also found that in districts that Trump carried in 2016 that are currently held by Democrats, the Republican candidate holds a 54 percent to 38 percent lead.\n\nRed state Democrats back in their home states for two weeks are coming face-to-face with constituents unhappy about their support for impeachment.\n\nThe New York Times\u2018 Daily podcast recently followed Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), a vulnerable Democrat in a red district who came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry, to three town halls, where she was confronted by upset constituents.\n\nAttendees shouted \u201cNot true! We didn\u2019t ask for that,\u201d \u201cFake news,\u201d and \u201cDo your job,\u201d at the town halls.\n\nSlotkin told them, \u201cI\u2019m going to wait for facts,\u201d and \u201clook at them judiciously.\u201d One attendee asked her why she signed an op-ed that came out in support of an impeachment inquiry before the facts were out: \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting, why did you send the op-ed?\u201d\n\nOne attendee told Slotkin that she liked her at first, but \u201cwhen you fell off the cliff for me was when you joined the coup against our president.\u201d That comment was greeted with agreement from others.\n\n#NEW: Democrat Rep.

Currently, the inquiry has been conducted behind closed doors.\n\nDemocrat groups are hoping to sway public opinion via their closed-door inquiry. Politico reported this week that a Democrat-aligned digital group ACRONYM is launching a $1 million ad campaign in battleground states focused on impeaching Trump.\n\nThe ads will first run in five states with 2020 electoral votes up for grabs \u2014 Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and could expand nationwide.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Republicans are poised to make impeachment an albatross for Democrats, particularly in red states that voted for President Trump.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/no-impeachment-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
