Demolition of the first four villages is scheduled to begin in 2023.\n\nActing under the name Menschenrecht vor Bergrecht \u2013 Human Rights Before Mining Rights \u2013 the alliance of villagers announced at a press conference in D\u00fcsseldorf on Monday they would refuse an expropriation agreement with RWE under which the energy company would pay to resettle them.\n\nThis would mean the company would have to apply to the regional government for formal permission to dispossess the residents. But the villagers said they would then challenge this in court.\n\nIn 2008, the environmental group BUND mounted a similar challenge against RWE, when it refused to sell an orchard in the village of Otzenrath on the edge of the surface mine. Protesters were eventually evicted and 87 fruit trees razed.\n\nMenschenrecht vor Bergrecht hopes it is on firmer legal ground to resist dispossession now that the government has announced plans to phase out coal by 2038 in a move away from fossil fuels.\n\nA piece of land on the boundary between the village of Keyenberg and the Garzweiler mine will serve as a testing ground.\n\n\u201cWe are using this land as an example, to ask the courts about the legal questions of expropriation,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cIf RWE does not agree we can keep this piece of land, we will use legal means to defend it. At the moment, this is the only way we can get legal clarity about our future and on whether what RWE is doing is legal \u2013 turning people out of their homes for coal, as the world struggles to combat the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students hold placards as they take part in a global climate strike in Berlin on 20 September. The placard on the right reads: \u2018Ice and snow, instead of RWE.\u2019 Photograph: Christian Mang/Reuters\n\nA report by the German Institute for Economic Research published this year argues that the government\u2019s new policy objectives render unnecessary RWE\u2019s plans to remove the villages around Garzweiler, as well as the forest by the Hambach surface mine. RWE says it considers the study \u201cunserious and unscientific\u201d.\n\nGermany's dirty coalmines become the focus for a new wave of direct action Read more\n\nAsked about the villagers\u2019 declaration, a spokesperson for RWE told the Guardian the group represented a minority of residents of the villages affected. \u201cThree-quarters of villagers have concluded negotiations over compensation payments, and their villages will be rebuilt in new locations,\u201d said Guido Steffen.\n\n\u201cWe take notice of the villagers\u2019 announcement and regret that these steps have to be taken,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a phase-out, not a breakdown of this industry, so we need the coal under these villages.\u201d\n\nMarita Dresen, a member of Menschenrecht vor Bergrecht from the village of Kuckum, said at the press conference on Monday: \u201cIt breaks my heart when I think about the fact that my entire life could be destroyed by a coal digger.\n\n\u201cThe legal route is not what we would have chosen, but it seems we have no other option if we\u2019re to get clarity. But I would never have taken this step alone. We are a team and we know that we are not just acting for our villages, but taking a stand against coal everywhere \u2013 and for the climate.\u201d", "description": "Residents say they will not be ousted by energy firm seeking to expand the Garzweiler mine", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4defc189cd132df14904df41da228b0db92f407b/0_120_5202_3121/master/5202.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91863bec649f3e00a8676a69be87c912", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
