Under the law, Americans could still choose to take a dispute to arbitration \u2015 which companies like to tout as a faster and cheaper alternative to the judicial system \u2015 but no one would be forced to give up their right to go to court.\n\nThe bill is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate, but anti-arbitration advocates were thrilled to even get a vote in the House.\n\n\u201c[Opposition] to forced arbitration has gotten more traction than it ever has before,\u201d said Karla Gilbride, a senior attorney at Public Justice who represents workers and consumers in cases against corporations, focusing on cases involving forced arbitration. \u201cThe more people find out about this, the more outraged and offended they get.\u201d\n\nBecause of the role it plays in sexual discrimination, assault and harassment lawsuits, enabling companies to push women into secret courtrooms and hush up misbehavior, forced arbitration has gotten increased attention in recent years.\n\nLaw students, Google workers and many activists have spoken out against the practice. A small number of companies, including Microsoft, Uber and Facebook, have even banned forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nAbout 60 million workers are covered by forced arbitration agreements \u2015 many of whom are unaware they\u2019ve signed away their rights, with agreements tucked away in employee handbooks and buried in employment contracts.\n\nEven more Americans \u2015 hundreds of millions \u2015 have agreed to forced arbitration as consumers by just clicking on the Terms of Service for an app, for example, or signing up for a credit card. LG apparently even put a forced arbitration clause on a sticker on one of its washing machines.\n\nOver the past decade, the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings in favor of the practice and forced arbitration agreements have become increasingly common.\n\nRecently, a California woman named Lilly who\u2019d been sexually assaulted at a Massage Envy spa was blocked from filing suit against the company because she\u2019d inadvertently agreed to arbitration when she downloaded the company\u2019s app.\n\nLilly, who is using only her first name to protect her identity, has been advocating for the Fair Act.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d she told HuffPost earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s about civil rights.\u201d\n\nGretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who filed a lawsuit in 2016 alleging she was sexually harassed at work, has been advocating for the Fair Act to be passed and has expressed \u201csincere hope\u201d that the Senate will take up the legislation.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment is apolitical,\u201d she told reporters after the vote. \u201cBefore somebody decides to harass you or assault you or abuse you, they don\u2019t ask what political party you\u2019re a part of. They don\u2019t care. They just do it.\u201d\n\nSara Boboltz contributed to this report.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that one Republican had voted for the bill. It was two Republicans.", "description": "The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, but advocates for women and consumers were thrilled to even get a vote on it.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82ad0b2300001c05571796.jpeg?cache=mrnz5kxqhf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
