I believe her comment \u2018jew down\u2019 was more in reference to negotiating not \u2018I hate jews,\u2019\u201d Ms. Vaughn wrote on Facebook, NJ.com reported. \u201cInappropriate in today\u2019s PC culture absolutely, but to Jew someone down is a verb and is not anti-anything or indicative of hating Jewish people.\u201d\n\nMr. Muschal claimed the slur is \u201cjust a statement of speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s like a car dealer, they wanted $5,000, you Jew \u2018em down to $4,000,\u201d he told the Globe. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing vicious. The expression has been said millions of times.\u201d\n\nAt-large councilman Jerell Blakeley has called on all three members to step down.\n\n\u201cAll three are an embarrassment to the city of Trenton and should resign,\u201d he told NJ.com.\n\nTrenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said Ms. McBride and Mr. Muschal have since apologized privately to the city attorney who worked on the settlement. Ms. Vaughn has yet to apologize, and none of them have yet done so publicly.\n\n\u201cThis is a teachable moment that people should [be] more tolerant and at the end of the day words do matter, and that if they\u2019re hurtful they should be either retracted or apologized for,\u201d the mayor told NJ.com.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
