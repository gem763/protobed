USA TODAY\n\nWe hear often about video games as a form of escapism. When you want a break from the real world, you can immerse yourself in another world, or simply distract yourself for a few moments matching gems.\n\nApple Arcade, the gaming subscription service from the makers of the iPhone, is an escape of its own: from a modern mobile marketplace featuring games often inundated with ads or repeated calls to spend money.\n\nApple Arcade launched for iPhone and iPod Touch last week with iOS 13 and is available for $4.99 a month, but users can experience it through a one-month free trial.\n\nThe service currently features more than 70 games, and Apple is promising an additional 30 titles over the coming weeks.\n\nApple TV+ also costs just $4.99 a month: Here's why it's so cheap\n\nProtect yourself online: 5 essential steps to fend off hackers and online criminals\n\nArcade features a really unique selection of games across a variety of interests. Among some of my favorites:\n\nA scene from the Apple Arcade game 'Overland.' (Photo: Apple)\n\nWhat The Golf. A fantastic \"golf\" game where players must conquer physics in crazy ways. Sometimes, you're trying to knock a golf ball into a moving hole. Other times, you're striking a giant soccer net. It surprises and delights in countless ways.\n\nSayonara Wild Hearts. Described as a \"playable music video\" during Apple's event earlier this month, this game combines the visual style of games like Rez with the game mechanics of a Temple Run into a gorgeous, neon-bright adventure.\n\nBig Time Sports. This collection of sports-themed mini-games features giant characters attempting to compete in a series of events including basketball, swimming and cycling. The controls are super simple, paying homage to classic arcade sports games like Track & Field.\n\nAssemble With Care. This puzzle game stars Maria, an antique restorer who travels to a new town to help its citizens repair possessions such as cassette players and old-school telephones. The puzzle portion comes with trying to determine how you'll fix every object brought to your attention.\n\nThe real draw of Apple Arcade is the focus strictly on the games themselves. There's no waiting for an ad to end so you can keep playing. No timers that need to expire to gain the energy you need to play again. No endless prompts begging you to spend 99 cents on an in-game item. You just get to play.\n\nOf course, there's the $4.99 you spend monthly to enter this mobile gaming oasis. So long as the roster of games continues to grow, it might be worth every virtual quarter.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2019/09/26/apple-arcade-why-its-worth-spending-5-month/3772670002/", "description": "Apple Arcade features a great selection of fun, unique games, but there's a bigger reason the service is worth the $5-a-month subscription.", "authors": ["Brett Molina", "Published A.M.
