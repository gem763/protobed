The U.S. Congresswoman from New York, who at 29, is the youngest ever to have a seat in the House of Representatives, was in Copenhagen, Denmark on Friday at the C40 World Mayors Summit.\n\n\u201c...I speak to you not as an elected official, or a public figure. But I speak to you as a human being. A woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children\u2019s future, and that our actions are responsible for bringing their most dire possibilities into focus,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd, sounding choking up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI speak to you as a human being.
