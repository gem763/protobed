His actions resulted in a 15-yard penalty and an immediate ejection from the game.\n\nBurfict is in his first year with the Raiders and was named a team captain to start the season, totaling 17 tackles in the first three games.\n\nHowever, he is no stranger to controversial hits, with 10 games' worth of suspensions and more than $4.2 million of forfeited money through fines and missed time, per Spotrac. This includes a four-game suspension for the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe linebacker has been suspended twice for illegal hits, one of them because of \"repeated violations of safety-related playing rules.\"\n\nAfter seeing Sunday's hit, many have argued for harsher punishments:\n\nThe Raiders will at least have to play without him for the rest of Sunday's game after leading 21-7 at the time of the incident.", "description": "Oakland Raiders  linebacker  Vontaze Burfict  was ejected from Sunday's game against the  Indianapolis Colts  after a head-to-head hit on tight end Jack Doyle...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/585/hi-res-5acb381f7ca184142f54be40b237fe58_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
