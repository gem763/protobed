He returned his passport, public health care documents and driver\u2019s license to their respective government departments, he says, and destroyed his Australian bank cards.\n\n\u201cI had assumed that I had true and correct membership inside the Commonwealth of Australia,\u201d Mr. Walubara, who is now 45, recounted writing in the accompanying letters to each government department. \u201cI have made a mistake: I\u2019m no longer eligible for the benefits of your society,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHere are your instruments back.\u201d\n\nWhile experts say that Mr. Walubara has a long road ahead before Australia would recognize his claims to sovereignty, his argument has caught the attention of the public and the national news media.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Australia Indigenous-Walubara-Yidinji.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
