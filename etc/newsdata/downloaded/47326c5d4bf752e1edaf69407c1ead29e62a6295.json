Twenty percent of Apple\u2019s sales come from China; roughly the same percentage as for Starbucks. Nearly a quarter of Intel\u2019s revenue is generated in China. And Texas Instruments could pretty much change its name at this point: Nearly half of its sales come out of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nChina\u2019s growing economic weight extends to more esoteric spheres as well. Take classical music: As orchestra revenues have fallen in their home markets, many have begun touring in China, a relatively new and hungry market for the genre. So the Eastman School of Music, in Rochester, New York, was not so unusual in planning a tour for a student orchestra in China later this year. Some eight student musicians would have visited eight Chinese cities over the holidays.\n\nThen a contretemps reminiscent of the recent NBA brouhaha erupted. The People\u2019s Republic denied entry visas to three of the group\u2019s musicians, who are South Korean citizens. Had the banned musicians tweeted support for the Hong Kong protestors, as Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey did? No. The crime of the South Koreans was\u2026being South Korean.\n\nIn 2016, South Korea installed the US-owned and operated- THAAD missile system, which protects it (and the American troops stationed there) from missile attacks. Ever since then, China has been sanctioning the wrong Korea \u2014 boycotting South Korean businesses, strictly curtailing Chinese tourism to Korea (many South Koreans joke that this is hardly a punishment), and banning various Korean musicians from entering the country. Its decision to bar three classical music students from visiting China was of a piece of Beijing\u2019s general strategy to bully its prosperous, democratic, and fall smaller neighbor.\n\nAt first, Eastman decided it would go ahead with the trip anyway. This was a disgraceful acquiescence to what was essentially a racist policy imposed by the Chinese government. Imagine an integrated group of musicians in the early part of the 20th century agreeing to tour the segregated south without its black performers. Indeed, in the 1940s, many white jazz musicians refused to play venues where black musicians were barred.\n\nEastman initially decided not to cancel because it \u201cwould be tremendously unfortunate to 80+ students who have been highly motivated by this opportunity,\u201d Eastman\u2019s Dean, Jamal Rossi, wrote in an internal email. \u201cWe know that families have altered holiday plans and have already made travel arrangements to enable their students to participate on this trip. Cancelling would likely have a negative impact on Eastman\u2019s reputation within China, and potentially limit other opportunities to recruit, perform, and tour for our faculty and other ensembles.\u201d\n\nMr. Rossi also claimed that no profits were at stake in the orchestra\u2019s decision to keep touring. A spokesman for the school declined to answer a question from the Washington Times regarding what kind of revenue the tour would have generated.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Mr. Rossi reversed his decision. \u201c[I]n consultation with many individuals, including University and Eastman leadership and our Chinese tour organizers, we have decided to postpone the tour until all members of the orchestra can participate,\u201d he wrote to Eastman students and faculty in an email obtained by the Washington Times. \u201cI am grateful to the many individuals who took the time to share their thoughts about this matter.\u201d\n\nThere was a widespread backlash to Eastman\u2019s decision among the school\u2019s students, faculty, students, and alumni. And unlike in the case of the NBA, where superstars like LeBron James objected that the league wasn\u2019t punitive enough on those who dare to stand up to Beijing, in this case, classical music aficionados objected to the school\u2019s too solicitous attitude towards Chinese despotism. These classical musicians and their fans have more bravery \u2014 and far more devotion to values like freedom \u2014 than do the \u201cheroes\u201d of the NBA. You may want to trade in your NBA tickets for a plum seat the next time the Eastman orchestra comes to town.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
