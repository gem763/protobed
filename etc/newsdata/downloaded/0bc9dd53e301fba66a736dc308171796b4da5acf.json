Joyce Beatty of Ohio and from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg said Facebook is committed to holding its plans for a digital currency until US regulators approve it, that apparently didn't stop him from taking that parting shot at lawmakers during the Instagram Next conference. That conference, closed to the public, saw Zuckerberg deliver brief opening remarks to an audience of Instagram influencers and members of the media.", "description": "\"I'm just coming from [Washington] D.C., so it's good to be somewhere where people are creating things,\" Zuckerberg said with a smile.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db33deadee01972ae714702?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
