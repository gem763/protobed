Within minutes, the fire was crawling \u2014 at alarming speed \u2014 up the facade of the 24-story public housing building. The fire was the deadliest in modern British history and provoked a national conversation about the yawning gap between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Grenfell United, a group that represents some of the survivors and relatives, said that \u201cwhile nothing can ever bring back our loved ones that passed away in the fire, this is a strong report.\u201d They also said that \u201csenior officers\u201d in the London Fire Brigade \u201cmust stop hiding behind the bravery of their front line fire fighters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMartin Moore-Bick, the retired judge who chairs a public inquiry into the fire, praised the bravery of individual firefighters, but said there were systemic failings within the fire services that meant their readiness for the fire was \u201cgravely inadequate.\u201d\n\nHe wrote there were \u201cserious shortcomings in the response of the LFB [London Fire Brigade], both in the operation of the control room and on the incident ground.\u201d\n\nHe specifically criticized the brigade\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d strategy. Residents were told to stay in their apartments rather than flee the burning building. This advice remained in place for almost two hours following the first call to emergency services. Moore-Bick said that if they had dropped that advice an hour before they did, there would have been \u201cfewer fatalities.\u201d He also said that the main reason \u201cwhy the flames spread so rapidly up the building\u201d was its combustible cladding, which will be examined further in the next stage of the inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirefighters hit back at the criticism. Matt Wrack, general-secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, told the BBC that by the time the firefighters arrived at the scene, the building was already \u201ca death trap.\u201d He also said that individual firefighters were being \u201csubjected to a degree of scrutiny which government ministers are avoiding.\u201d\n\nParliament is expected to debate the findings of the report later on Wednesday.\n\nThe so-called \u201cstay put\u201d advice is commonly given because it\u2019s often safer for residents to stay inside high-rise concrete buildings, which are built so that fires don\u2019t leap from apartment to apartment. Staying put means that residents don\u2019t run out into smoke-filled corridors or get in the way of busy firefighters.\n\nAD\n\nAhmed Chellat previously told The Washington Post how he pleaded with Faouzia El-Wahabi, his sister-in-law, on the phone for her and her family to leave their 21st-floor apartment, but she told him that emergency services told her to \u201cstay put\u201d and that they were coming to get her. She died in the blaze with her family.\n\nAD\n\nThe report also criticized the head of the fire brigade Dany Cotton, who upset relatives and survivors when she told the inquiry that she wouldn\u2019t change anything that they did on the night.\n\nMoore-Bick said that her comment was \u201cremarkably insensitive.\u201d Cotton has already announced that she would retire next year.\n\n\u201cThe commissioner\u2019s evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire,\u201d Moore-Bick wrote.\n\nThe day after the fire, then-Prime Minister Theresa May announced a public inquiry, promising that \u201cno stone will be left unturned.\u201d Today\u2019s 935-page report, some of which was leaked to the British press earlier in the week, covers the events on the night of the fire. The second phase of the inquiry will begin in the new year and will focus on the events leading up to the night of the fire, such as how the tower came to be wrapped in combustible cladding.\n\nAD", "description": "A damning new report is critical of fire brigade\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d advice.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/39syd-jjI51kXzn_HVq4CXQGtYc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VGL2NWX3AYI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
