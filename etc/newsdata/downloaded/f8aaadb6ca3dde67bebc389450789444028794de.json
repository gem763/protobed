If I was not performing people could blame the squad, the tactics. \u201cCristiano [Ronaldo] hasn\u2019t scored?\u201d We didn\u2019t play well. \u201cVan Nistelrooy didn\u2019t score?\u201d He didn\u2019t have the opportunities, we didn\u2019t cross. Because the guy: He. Will. Score.\n\n\u2018Now, you look, and the excuse is, \u201cPogba hasn\u2019t played.\u201d It is crazy to put a club in this position. I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t put the blame on Rashford, you can\u2019t put the blame on Martial, you can\u2019t put the blame on the newcomers. Who is big enough in that squad to be saying, \u201cThis is falling down\u201d? Apart from Pogba. It is unfair on him, unfair on the squad.\n\n\u2018It is right that I hear Gary Neville complain about the chemistry that has been built. You could put any manager in right now; I\u2019m sorry, he will struggle.\n\nLouis Saha gave his verdict on the young duo (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018You can say, alright he should not have allowed [Romelu] Lukaku and [Alexis] Sanchez to leave but the damage was already done because those guys didn\u2019t want to stay. So it is better to actually clean up in some ways, let\u2019s say, with respect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But the actual power of the United history, the United set-up, has been fettered by three or four transfer windows. It was like a shotgun in two feet. They put themselves in that situation, not giving the platform to fight back.\u2019\n\nManchester United welcome Liverpool to Old Trafford this weekend.", "description": "Louis Saha believes Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford are struggling at Manchester United due to their surroundings and insists the pair can't be blamed for their lack of impact this season.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_81418824_1571131278.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
