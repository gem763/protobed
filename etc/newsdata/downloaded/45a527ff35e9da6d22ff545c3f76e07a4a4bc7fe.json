That could prove unacceptable to Eurosceptics and splinter the fragile coalition Mr Johnson has created for his deal.\n\nDowning Street has been increasingly optimistic that the numbers are in place to win the first big vote on the legislation tonight, known as the second reading. There are claims that Labour could abstain, although sources dismissed the idea.\n\nWhat votes are happening tonight? Second reading: The first big vote on the Brexit legislation. MPs will be asked to approve the Bill in principle, so it can go forward for detailed scrutiny. If the text is rejected at this point, it is effectively dead. Programme motion: The government is trying to set a tight timetable so the law can be rushed through to meet Boris Johnson's 'do or die' Brexit date of October 31. But many MPs are complaining that it does not give enough time to scrutinise the Bill. If the government loses it will make the PM's deadline almost impossible to meet - although it will not necessarily kill of the deal altogether.\n\nHowever, there are mounting fears that MPs will use the 'Titanic Tuesday' showdown to take an axe to the PM's plans to push the measures through at breakneck speed.\n\nDefeat of the so-callled programme motion - which sets out a tight schedule for passing the EU Withdrawal Bill - is essential for Mr Johnson to keep his 'do or die' vow to secure Brexit by October 31.\n\nCritically for Mr Johnson, former Tory rebels including Rory Stewart and Ken Clarke have indicated they intend to go against the government. Others such as Sir Oliver Letwin have made clear they will support it, and a handful of Labour MPs will be on board - leaving the result on a knife edge,\n\nBut Remainer MPs hope that if they drag their heels the EU will agree to delay the date for months.\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg upped the stakes today by warning that 'a vote against the programme motion is a vote against Brexit',\n\nBut the tough talk looked to backfire, with former Tory MP Ed Vaizey responding on Twitter: 'Oh dear. Any more ludicrous tweets like this and I may change my mind and vote against the programme motion.'\n\nA spokesman for the PM would not comment on whether he would pull the Bill if a customs union was added, although No10 suggested yesterday that the process will be at risk.\n\nBoris Johnson is struggling to get his 110-page Brexit Withdrawal Bill through Parliament\n\nLiz Truss, Dominic Raab and Steve Barclay were among the ministers at Cabinet in Downing Street earlier today\n\nOvernight Mr Johnson appealed to MPs to back his deal 'so that we can leave without disruption and provide a framework for a new relationship based on free trade and friendly co-operation'.\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit crisis? Tuesday: Potentially the most critical day for the Brexit deal. Debate on the WA legislation will begin in the Commons, with crucial second reading votes expected in the evening. If the Bill is torpedoed at this point, the Brexit process will be back to square one. The programme motion will also need to be approved, setting out the timetable for legislation being passed, if Mr Johnson is to have much chance of getting Brexit through for October 31. Wednesday-Thursday: Assuming the second reading is successful, detailed scrutiny will be carried out in the Commons and the Lords. There will be knife-edge votes on amendments calling for customs union membership and a second referendum. All being well, final approval should be given at third reading on Thursday night. Friday-Sunday: The Bill moves to the Lords where another fight for surpremacy beckons between the government and Remainers. October 28: The EU has suggested an emergency summit could be held on this date to consider a Brexit extension if the deal has not gone through Parliament.\n\nThe PM said: 'I hope Parliament votes to take back control for itself and the British people and the country can start to focus on the cost of living, the NHS, and conserving our environment.\n\n'The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. Let's get Brexit done on October 31 and move on.'\n\nGovernment sources said there was a 'good chance' the deal would pass its first Commons hurdle today when MPs vote on whether they support it in principle.\n\nBut there is a growing revolt over Mr Johnson's plans to push the deal through quickly to meet his 'do or die' pledge to leave by October 31.\n\nOpening a new front, Mr Boles tweeted that he had tabled an amendment 'to require the government by default to seek an extension of the transition to Dec 2022 unless MPs pass a resolution to the contrary'.\n\n'We must stop No Deal Brexit in Dec 2020,' he added.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg stunned MPs last night by announcing a 72-hour timetable for pushing the 110-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which will put the deal into law, through the Commons.\n\nAlong with the Government's publication of the bill, No. 10 released a promotional video on its Twitter page accompanied by dramatic music and a montage of images.\n\nIt said: 'Our new deal with the EU means we can leave on October 31. Take back control of our laws, borders and money .. This new deal will allow us to move on and focus on the people's priorities.'\n\nBut there are aspects of the Brexit deal which will raise eyebrows among staunch Leavers, including:\n\nA provision that will see the country still subject to the rulings of judges at the European Court of Justice during the transition period, scheduled to last until January 2021;\n\nCommitments for the Commons to have votes on whether to follow suit every time the EU introduces new employment rights;\n\nPromises for ministers to consult trade unions on all new laws that impact workers' rights;\n\nExplanatory notes published with the Bill reveal ministers expect a new organisation to monitor the rights of EU citizens in the UK will cost \u00a3146million over ten years.\n\nMPs will vote on the programme motion just after 7pm tonight. If ministers are defeated, the Government would lose control of the timetable, meaning there would be almost no chance of getting the law passed by October 31.\n\nFormer Tory chief whip Mark Harper said anyone voting against the timetable would be trying to wreck Brexit, adding: 'They cannot hide in plain sight. They will be frustrating Brexit and this House's ability to deliver on the EU referendum result.'\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay yesterday called on MPs to 'respect the referendum' by backing the Bill, warning them: 'This is the chance to leave the EU with a deal on October 31.'\n\nThe DUP says it will vote against the deal in protest at proposals for requiring customs checks on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\n\nBut the vast majority of the so-called Tory Spartans, who voted against Theresa May's deal three times, have indicated they will back the plan.\n\nAnd ministers believe up to a dozen Labour MPs from pro-Leave seats could now back it under pressure from their constituents.\n\nHowever, they fear that the loss of the timetable motion could allow MPs to string out approval of the legislation for weeks, potentially forcing Mr Johnson to accept a Brexit extension from the EU he has vowed to resist.\n\nNo10 strategist Dominic Cummings appeared in high spirits as he arrived for work today\n\nThe WAB runs to 110 pages and is accompanied by 124 pages of explanatory notes\n\nUnder the provisions of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (CRAG), an international treaty - such as the Brexit deal - must be laid before Parliament for at least 21 sitting days before ratification to take place.\n\nHowever in order for the Government's timetable to be met, there is a provision in the WAB which 'disapplies' the relevant section of the CRAG.\n\nMPs have complained that the short time frame to debate the Prime Minister's new Brexit deal avoids proper scrutiny.\n\nAfter the Bill was introduced for a first reading in the Commons last night evening, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of 'trying to bounce MPs into signing off a Bill that could cause huge damage to our country'.\n\nIndependent Group for Change MP Chris Leslie said the Government was 'ramming through' the Bill.\n\nHe said: 'We know for example that Commons committee stage of the Treaty of Rome was not three days, or two days, it was 22 days.\n\n'For the Maastricht Treaty, 23 days in committee stage. The Treaty of Lisbon 11 days. Treaty of Amsterdam five days.\n\n'Then the Single European Act four days and then the smallest of them all the Treaty of Nice three days at committee, so in total five days of Commons consideration for the Treaty of Nice to be reformed.\n\n'This is an unprecedentedly short period of time to dedicate to a massive and momentous piece of legislation.'\n\nHe added: 'This motion that we are now debating, (is) the first in a series of attempts by the Government to stage what is essentially the ramming through of a piece of legislation, in I regard a disorderly way.'\n\nBoris Johnson's crunch 72 hours: MPs set to vote on Brexit deal for first time TONIGHT - but even if the PM wins he faces a massive battle to stick to his 'do or die' October 31 vow\n\nBoris Johnson will today ask MPs to vote for his Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that will put his divorce deal into law and make Brexit happen on October 31.\n\nThe government wants to crash the 110-page document through the House of Commons in just three days as the PM tries to stick to his 'do or die' Halloween pledge.\n\nBut many MPs are furious about the contents of the PM's deal as well as Downing Street's proposed rapid timetable for passing the agreement into law.\n\nThat means Mr Johnson is facing the most grueling 72 hours of his premiership so far as he tries to keep his deal alive and see off any attempts to derail it.\n\nEven if his draft accord is able to survive the next three days, there are further sticking points lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe WAB will then have to be agreed by the Remain-heavy House of Lords as well as the European Parliament while the EU could still offer a Brexit delay.\n\nBelow is an analysis of all of the potential flashpoints which the PM will have to successfully navigate in order to take the UK out of the EU in an orderly fashion on October 31.\n\nThe second reading vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill\n\nAt 7pm this evening the House of Commons will vote for the first time on the terms of Mr Johnson's proposed divorce deal.\n\nMPs will be asked to give a second reading to the WAB - the first proper hurdle any legislation going through the Commons must clear.\n\nJeremy Corbyn will whip his MPs to vote against it, as will the DUP, the Lib Dems and the Scottish Nationalists.\n\nIf MPs vote for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at second reading the government will then try to win a vote on crashing the Bill through the Commons in just three days. Former Tory MP Ed Vaizey is one of many who could oppose the timetable\n\nBut Number 10 believes it has won back almost all the hardline Brexiteers who killed off Theresa May\u2019s deal as well as Tory Remain rebels, and has enough votes from Labour leavers and independents to get it over the line.\n\nIf the vote is lost, the deal is effectively dead and with it any hope of getting out of the EU by the end of the month.\n\nThe vote on how much time MPs should spend debating the WAB\n\nImmediately after the second reading vote, assuming the PM wins, MPs will then be asked to vote on the timetable for the passage of the Brexit legislation.\n\nThis vote is potentially even more important than the vote on the deal itself because if MPs reject the government's timetable then the PM's hopes of delivering Brexit by October 31 will be in serious peril.\n\nMinisters will try their utmost to drive the Bill through in time for October 31, and want the Commons stages completed by Thursday.\n\nThey are proposing two midnight sittings today and tomorrow to get the bulk of the work done.\n\nBut opposition MPs \u2013 and some Tory rebels \u2013 will demand more time for debate.\n\nIf they reject the government's timetable, Mr Johnson will have a decision to make: Either propose an alternative timetable, giving MPs more time but killing his 'do or die' pledge or pull the legislation and demand a general election on the grounds that Parliament is obstructing Brexit.\n\nIf the government is defeated on the so-called 'programme motion' it will be all but impossible for the PM to 'get Brexit done' in the next nine days.\n\nThe possibility of the EU offering a Brexit delay\n\nMr Johnson was forced to comply with the anti-No Deal Benn Act and asked the EU for a Brexit delay at the weekend.\n\nBrussels is keeping its powder dry on what it will do next until MPs have actually voted on the premier's divorce deal.\n\nIf Mr Johnson secures the backing of MPs for his deal this evening and the Commons then agrees to his timetable the EU is unlikely to offer a delay because it will still be possible to hit the October 31 departure date.\n\nBut if the deal is voted down - the vote is expected to be very tight - or if the deal is agreed but the timetable is rejected then the EU will almost certainly offer a Brexit delay even though Mr Johnson has told the bloc he does not want one.\n\nDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, made clear the EU would likely offer an extension in such circumstances this morning as he tweeted: 'A No Deal Brexit will never be our decision.'\n\nLeader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, pictured yesterday, set out the proposed timetable for debating the WAB. Many MPs want more time to digest the contents of the Bill\n\nMPs hijacking the WAB\n\nAssuming the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is given its second reading tonight it will then immediately move onto its committee stage - the bit in the legislative process when MPs can table amendments.\n\nThere will be lots of amendments brought forward by MPs in a bid to change the PM's divorce deal.\n\nBut Number 10 will be most wary of two: One which would force the UK to be in a customs union with the EU after Brexit and one on making the PM's agreement subject to a second referendum.\n\nThe customs union amendment is expected to be brought forward by Labour. It would make post-Brexit free trade deals all but impossible.\n\nA similar proposal in April lost by only three votes. Downing Street aides have made it clear they will not swallow a customs union \u2013 the issue on which Mr Johnson quit Mrs May\u2019s government \u2013 and suggest such an amendment would kill the Bill.\n\nWith Tory rebels backing away from the idea yesterday, the vote will hinge on the actions of the DUP, SNP and Labour leavers.\n\nThe second referendum amendment is likely to be tabled by Labour backbenchers.\n\nIt would propose a Brexit delay until the country has voted on Brexit for a second time with Mr Johnson's deal pitched against Remain.\n\nIf it passes, Mr Johnson will have to abandon the Bill and \u2013 in the short term \u2013 Brexit.\n\nBut despite the determined efforts of Remain campaigners, the Commons has never voted for a second referendum, and there seems little prospect of a majority emerging at this stage.\n\nThe WAB itself: Proposed continuation of EU law\n\nThere are a number of problematic areas in the WAB which could be difficult for some MPs to vote for.\n\nOne relates to the continued application of EU law in the UK after the Brexit divorce date.\n\nThe last government under Mrs May delighted Tory Eurosceptic MPs by bringing forward and passing the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n\nMany of the measures contained within the WAB will be opposed by different groups of MPs setting up potential clashes in the House of Commons (pictured yesterday) in the coming days\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill proposes resurrecting the hated European Communities Act 1972. The government has tried to assuage the concerns of Brexiteers like Sir Bill Cash\n\nThat legislation committed to repealing the European Communities Act 1972 - the law which took the UK into the EU and gave Brussels law supremacy over British law - when Brexit takes place.\n\nHowever, clause one of the WAB would pause the repeal of the Act so that the UK would remain under EU law during the proposed transition period which is due to expire at the end of 2020.\n\nThis was always expected to happen so that there is a stable basis on which the UK and EU can thrash out the terms of their future trading relationship.\n\nBut the European Communities Act is loathed by Brexiteers who view it as a symbol of the EU's unacceptable influence over the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, the WAB makes clear that should there be an extension to the transition period then the Act would continue to apply. This will be hard for many in the European Research Group of Tory MPs to swallow.\n\nThe government is aware of how much many MPs will hate the prospect of the UK continuing to have to abide by EU law during the implementation period.\n\nAs a result, Mr Johnson has preemptively tried to assuage their concerns through clause 29 of the WAB.\n\nThis would allow the European Scrutiny Select Committee - chaired by leading Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash - to review any problematic EU legislation with recommendations then put to a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nFor example, if the committee deemed a piece of EU law to be damaging to the UK's national interest it could say so in a report and then MPs would vote on whether to ask the EU to change course.\n\nExtending the transition period\n\nAnti-No Deal MPs are concerned about what will happen if the EU and UK are unable to agree the terms of their future relationship by the end of the transition period.\n\nThe two sides have agreed that if that happens there could then be a further two year transition extension.\n\nHowever, as currently drafted the WAB only offers Parliament the right to sign off a proposed extension.\n\nIt does not give MPs the ability to force the government to ask for an extension.\n\nThat means that if the government did not ask the EU for more time to discuss the terms of a free trade agreement the UK would be on course to crash out of the bloc with No Deal.\n\nMPs will try to amend the legislation to give Parliament more of a say over whether there should be a transition extension.\n\nNick Boles, a former Tory and now independent MP, has tabled an amendment which would effectively guarantee a transition period extension if no trade deal has been agreed between the EU and UK by the end of 2020\n\nFormer Tory Nick Boles today tabled an amendment which would require the government by default to seek an extension to the transition to December 2022 unless MPs pass a resolution to the contrary in the event trade talks have not finished.\n\nBrexiteers will oppose any such move. They believe that there should be a hard cut-off point on the transition period so that the UK will finally sever ties with the EU.\n\nThe importance of the issue was highlighted today after Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, suggested a trade deal could take at least three years to finalise - long past the current end of 2020 deadline.\n\nThe influence of MPs over future trade negotiations\n\nThe government is proposing giving Parliament oversight of negotiations for the future relationship between the EU and UK.\n\nEffectively, the government would set out its negotiating objectives to MPs and then ask them to vote for the proposed way forward.\n\nMPs could then vote to change those objectives and the government is committing to then pursue the agreed objectives during talks with Brussels.\n\nHowever, any changes would still have to comply with what the UK and EU have agreed in the political declaration - the second bit of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal - which sets out the broad goals of future talks.\n\nLabour pro-deal MPs have previously said that giving parliament a say on future negotiating objectives could be enough to win their support. It remains to be seen whether what has been proposed goes far enough for them to back the PM's accord.\n\nNo more 'meaningful vote'\n\nA law passed by MPs last year dictated that the government would have to win a 'meaningful vote' on a Brexit deal as well as passing legislation to implement the deal in order for the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion.\n\nHowever, after Mr Johnson tried and failed to hold a 'meaningful vote' on Saturday and was then denied the chance to hold another one yesterday the government is proposing to delete the requirement.\n\nClause 32 of the WAB would abolish the need to hold a 'meaningful vote' with the passage of the new legislation enough to deliver Brexit.\n\nNorthern Ireland and the payment of the Brexit bill\n\nThe WAB obviously contains Mr Johnson's replacement for the Irish border backstop and makes clear that Northern Ireland will be treated differently to the rest of the UK on the key issue of customs. The DUP will continue to oppose the measures and could try to change them.\n\nIn clause 20, the WAB enshrines the payment of the Brexit bill - worth an estimated \u00a339 billion - into British law.\n\nMany Brexiteers believe the UK should not have to hand over the money at all while others believe payment should be tied to whether a trade deal is successfully agreed.\n\nHowever, if Brexiteers vote for the PM's deal at second reading it is unlikely they would then blow up the legislation during committee stage by trying to change the payment plans.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker (left) and Michel Barnier (right), pictured this morning in Strasbourg, have made clear to the European Parliament that they want MEPs to support the Brexit deal\n\nSuspending normal requirements for scrutinising new treaties\n\nA complex piece of legislation called the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act dictates that MPs should be given 21 days to consider a new international treaty before they are asked to vote on it.\n\nThe government is suspending this requirement in a bid to stick to the October 31 deadline.\n\nMany MPs are not happy about the amount of time being made available to them to digest the terms of the divorce agreement and 'CRAG' could become a major row.\n\nAfter the Commons the WAB must get through the House of Lords\n\nAssuming the government can get the WAB through the Commons without any major changes having been made to it, the legislation will then go to the House of Lords for further scrutiny.\n\nIf MPs have voted for a law convention dictates that ultimately peers will also have to agree to it because of the supremacy of the Commons over the upper chamber.\n\nBut the Remain-heavy House of Lords is likely to want to take its time as it debates the WAB and that could risk the October 31 deadline not being met.\n\nThe government will do everything it can to get the legislation through speedily but it will face intense resistance from peers.\n\nThe final hurdle: The European Parliament\n\nThe European Parliament will only debate and vote on the Brexit deal if and when it has been agreed by the UK Parliament.\n\nEU chiefs have urged MEPs to back the deal and it is thought that when it comes to the crunch a majority will support the agreement.\n\nIf they do then the deal will be home and dry. But if the European Parliament blocks it then the EU and UK will be forced to go back to the drawing board.", "description": "Boris Johnson has fired the starting gun on a 72-hour dash to get crucial legislation implementing the package through - urging the House of Commons to\u00a0'take back control' from Brussels.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/13/20034440-0-image-a-158_1571747096240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
