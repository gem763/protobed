There was a team meeting and some hard truths were spelled out. It was uncomfortable but necessary, the players said. There was anger and frustration.\n\nScotland has a new setting to refocus in after the 27-3 drubbing in Yokohama to open their Rugby World Cup. The Scots are in a high-rise hotel in Kobe with a view over the port city\u2019s attractive skyline and a chance to look up again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to put Ireland behind us,\u201d Scotland flyhalf Finn Russell said on Wednesday.\n\nThe squad\u2019s been stewing on the loss to their Six Nations rival for three days.\n\nScotland was completely outplayed. Lacked aggression and energy in the words of coach Gregor Townsend in the immediate aftermath. They were never in it. Desperate disappointment inside the squad has been exacerbated by furious criticism from fans and commentators back home.\n\nScotland\u2019s recent history of poor starts in games isn\u2019t over. The Scots conceded three tries and were down 19-3 after 25 minutes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was one boy who came off the pitch who had the best game, myself included,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe had a long time to get ready for this game \u2026 we just never performed.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of anger and frustration, Russell said, but it\u2019s time to put that away. It\u2019s not going to help against Samoa on Monday night in Kobe. The Samoans will thrive if the Scots lose their heads and the game turns fast and furious.\n\n\u201cIf we try and play (Samoa) on frustration and anger, it\u2019s not going to happen. We need to stick to our structure and stick to what we do rather than thinking we\u2019re going to beat them with anger and frustration. That\u2019s not how you win international test matches.\u201d\n\nThe Ireland loss cost Scotland more than just pride. Scotland lost back-rower Hamish Watson and scrumhalf Ali Price for the rest of the tournament with injury. Flanker Watson\u2019s physical presence will especially be missed against Samoa.\n\nSamoa could be a couple of men down in Kobe, too. Some of the Samoan aggression was a little over the top in the win over Russia. Center Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu\u2019u have been cited for dangerous high tackles and could be banned.\n\nWhile Russell said Scotland had to take the loss against Ireland \u201con the chin\u201d and bounce back, teammate Jamie Ritchie has done just that, although the blow was on his cheek.\n\nRitchie is back with the squad and available for the Samoa game after recovering from a broken cheekbone in a warmup with Georgia. The flanker had surgery and a metal plate inserted in his cheek, or so he was told by doctors.\n\n\u201cI think so. I was asleep for it,\u201d Ritchie said.\n\nScotland was also asleep for Ireland. Time to wake up.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's taken Scotland a few days to get over Ireland.
