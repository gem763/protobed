The Vermont senator underwent a procedure last week to have two stents inserted after experiencing what his campaign initially described as \u201cchest discomfort\u201d during a campaign event.\n\nDays later, as Sanders was discharged from the hospital, his campaign revealed that he had suffered a heart attack.\n\nThe episode has brought Sanders\u2019s age \u2014 he\u2019s 78 years old and would be 79 by the time he took office \u2014 and health to the forefront of his presidential campaign at a time when he has seen his political support slip.
