We\u2019ll give you an idea of how much to save and how you can reach that goal more quickly.\n\nRemember \u2014 the most important step is simply getting started. After all, some progress is always better than none.\n\nWhy Do I Need An Emergency Fund?\n\nA surprising number of Americans \u2014 roughly 60 percent \u2014 don\u2019t have enough funds saved to cover a $1,000 emergency.\n\nThat means most of us would have to go into debt to pay for something as simple \u2014 and common \u2014 as a leaky roof repair or a new car bumper. That\u2019s not to mention the sky-high costs of emergency health care.\n\nNobody likes to think these things will happen, but there\u2019s no way to predict when you\u2019ll be faced with unforeseen expenses.\n\nWhen disaster strikes, emergency funds can keep you from going deep into debt.\n\nShouldn\u2019t I Pay Off My Debts First?\n\nA lot of folks say it\u2019s better to pay off your debts before saving for an emergency fund. However, that defeats the purpose.\n\nSince emergency funds exist to keep you from going deeper into debt, it\u2019s important that you have at least something \u2014 even if it\u2019s just $1,000 \u2014 saved before you work on your credit card debt.\n\nThis way, you won\u2019t be adding even more debt to the pile.\n\nHow Much Should I Save?\n\nMost experts recommend building an emergency fund of roughly three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses based on your typical monthly budget. That should be enough if you lose your job or withstand any other catastrophic event.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no way to know how much an emergency will cost, so you should continue adding to your fund even after reaching your initial goals.\n\nThat said, savings accounts don\u2019t offer as much growth as other types of investments, so keeping too much cash in savings can limit your earned interest.\n\nGetting Started\n\nYou probably can\u2019t save six months\u2019 worth of money in one month, so start by contributing whatever you can take out of your budget. Even if you begin with just $50 per month, you\u2019ll still be making progress and give yourself something to build on. From there, you can continue reviewing your budget each month and look for new ways to save money.\n\nYou might not be able to deposit several thousand dollars into savings if you\u2019re dealing with other financial obligations. If you\u2019re still in debt, set a goal to save roughly $1,000 for your emergency fund first. You can start making larger contributions after you pay off your debts.\n\nFinding A Savings Account\n\nYou might think that all savings accounts are created equal, but some offer important perks that make them better investments than the alternative. Finding the perfect savings account can substantially increase your interest rate, so it\u2019s important to do some research up front in order to identify the best deal.\n\nMost savings accounts offer relatively low interest, so look for a high-yield account that will give you more money each year. High-yield savings accounts typically offer around two percent annual percentage yield, substantially more than is available with traditional savings accounts. They\u2019re insured for up to $250,000 and offer the same liquidity associated with other savings accounts.\n\nSee Also: How To Become A Millionaire With Compound Interest\n\nTips For Building An Emergency Fund\n\nEveryone\u2019s approach to personal finance is different, but there are some strategies that can help you reach your savings goals quickly.\n\nRemember that long-term success is all about developing the right habits, even if it takes time for those changes to pay off.\n\nDon\u2019t Waste It\n\nAn emergency fund provides additional financial stability, and it\u2019s important to leave the money there for real emergencies. While it can be tempting to pull some cash out to cover immediate expenses, this is rarely a good decision \u2014 it\u2019s tough to stop once you start withdrawing your savings.\n\nIt\u2019s best to keep your emergency fund entirely separate from other accounts. Routine payments and purchases should never involve the money in your emergency fund. You might find this easier if you use one bank for your emergency fund and another for checking and other savings accounts.\n\nAdd Savings To Your Budget\n\nSaving money can be a tough habit to get into, and it\u2019s easier when you set a monthly savings goal and automatically transfer the money each month. This makes saving your first financial priority and ensures that you make a contribution every month.\n\nStory continues", "description": "You probably realize you need an emergency fund, but it\u2019s hard to know exactly how to start one.
