Authorities objected, among other things, to what they said was Uber\u2019s failure to report serious criminal offenses and allegations that the company used technology to evade law enforcement officials.\n\nTFL said its approach was producing results and \u201chas led to the app-based firm improving its culture and governance.\u201d\n\nUber received the two-month license \u201cto allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application,\u201d TFL said in a statement .\n\nThe two-month license comes with the same stricter conditions as the 15-month permit, along with new requirements that TFL said would ensure passenger safety, although it did not provide more details.\n\nUber said it will \u201cwork closely with TFL\u201d and provide any extra information it asks for.\n\n\u201cTFL\u2019s recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London,\u201d said Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe.\n\nSan Francisco-based Uber has expanded rapidly around the world by providing an alternative to traditional taxis with a smartphone app linking people to drivers of private cars.\n\nThat\u2019s drawn protests from companies that say Uber drivers don\u2019t have to comply with the same licensing standards as London\u2019s storied black cab drivers, giving it an unfair advantage and placing the public at risk.\n\nThe company says it has changed since CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took over. He tried to shift the company away from its combative stance with municipal officials soon after London pulled its license.", "description": "Uber has been on short-term licenses rather than a full five-year license.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO661_Uber_ZG_20190801181211.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
