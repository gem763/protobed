Under the ACT's new laws, from February 2020 it will be legal for Canberrans to possess up to 50 grams of cannabis. On Sunday Attorney-General Christian Porter said he had written to his ACT counterpart and advised him the Territory's legislation does not align with federal law. \"They\u2019re terrible laws for a variety of reasons. I\u2019ve written to the ACT A-G today, simply stating what is the best advice that we\u2019ve received about the legal situation that\u2019s been created,\u201d Mr Porter said. \u201cThe ACT laws removed the criminal component at a territory level but didn\u2019t establish anything that is a positive right to possess, which means that there\u2019s no defence to the Commonwealth law that criminalises amounts under 50gm. \u201cSo my advice and the advice that I\u2019ve provided to the ACT Attorney-General is that it is still against the law of the Commonwealth to possess cannabis in the ACT.\u201d Image: News Corp Australia", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
