The iPhone giant\u2019s stock has surged 18% since early August after it suffered a post Q3 earnings-release selloff.\n\nApple is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 financial results on Wednesday, October 30\u2014which will be here before we know it. Now let\u2019s dive into what to expect from Apple\u2019s quarterly results, including iPhone and Services sales.\n\nApple\u2019s Pitch\n\nApple has spent years developing its brand around the world through sleek tech and exceptional marketing. Forbes last ranked Apple as the most valuable brand in world, in front of Google GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, Facebook FB and Coca-Cola KO. It is this name recognition and clout that has helped Apple continue to grow and sell its high-priced iPhones, Macs, iPads, and more.\n\nThe company recently released its latest line of smartphones under the iPhone 11 banner at price points that roughly match last year\u2019s new high-end models\u2014after years of price hikes. Apple also lowered the price on some of its older models in order to provide more incentive to buy or upgrade during the vital holiday shopping period. Sales of Apple\u2019s flagship smartphone have slipped recently and the firm has taken a hit in China amid the ongoing trade war, as consumers in the world\u2019s second largest economy opt instead for any of the array of less expensive smartphone offerings.\n\nApple executives have known for years that they need to be more than an iPhone company. This makes the rise of its services business, which includes Spotify SPOT challenger Apple Music, its app store, and more, key. Going forward, Wall Street will want to see if its soon-to-be-launched streaming TV service can attract users, compete alongside Netflix NFLX and Disney DIS, and eventually make money. Along with Apple TV+, the company has a monthly magazine-heavy news service, an credit card, and a new Apple Arcade video game service.\n\nOutlook & Comparisons\n\nBefore we look ahead, it is worth remembering that Apple\u2019s iPhone and Greater China sales have fallen in each of the last three quarters, with iPhone sales down on the back of hard to compare periods. This means a 2020 turnaround is likely in store and Apple\u2019s sales actually popped 1% last quarter (Q3 fiscal 2019) after revenue slipped 5.1% in Q2 and 4.5% in Q1.\n\nThird-quarter 2019 iPhone sales still fell 12%, but that marked an improvement. Meanwhile, other units picked up the slack. \u201cThis was our biggest June quarter ever \u2014 driven by all-time record revenue from Services, accelerating growth from Wearables, strong performance from iPad and Mac and significant improvement in iPhone trends,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\nOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Apple\u2019s Q4 2019 sales to slip 0.52% to $62.57 billion. This projected decline doesn\u2019t look as bad when we consider that Apple\u2019s revenue soared 20% in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nAAPL\u2019s overall fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to dip 2.7% to $258.43 billion, after FY18\u2019s sales surged 16%, with FY17 up 6.3%.", "description": "Shares of Apple (AAPL) hover just below their 52-week highs as Wall Street prepares for the busy part of the September quarter earnings season.
