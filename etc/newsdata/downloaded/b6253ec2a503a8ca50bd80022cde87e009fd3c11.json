We can be attacked at any time, without warning. And we aren\u2019t doing enough to fortify and protect ourselves.\n\nThis war doesn\u2019t involve tanks, artillery, or traditional armies. It isn\u2019t even always fought between nations. It includes cyberattacks on companies, governments and individuals. It involves hacking, spreading propaganda through social media, intellectual property theft, and stealing military secrets.\n\nThis is America\u2019s secret cyberwar \u2013 and we\u2019ve been fighting it since the dawn of the Internet. It is the topic of this week\u2019s episode of \u201cNewt\u2019s World.\u201d\n\n5 ESSENTIAL STEPS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM HACKERS AND ONLINE CRIMINALS\n\nWe are fighting this invisible war every day. And we, as a nation, need to do more to protect ourselves against these advanced adversaries.\n\nOn the episode, I speak with Chris Gore, the CEO of D4C Global, a private counterintelligence firm based in Fairfax, Va. He served as an agent at the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. The world that Chris describes is unlike anything you will hear about in mainstream media outlets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe truth is, we have several highly trained, smart teams of people in our government and private sector who get up every day to go fight this war on our behalf, but their job is incredibly tough. The main reason is that virtually every American is a target.\n\nIn a world where just about everyone has a cellphone, laptop, or other device (which connects to a Wi-Fi network that many other people are connected to) it can be relatively easy for a thief \u2013 or attacker \u2013 to gather a tremendous amount of valuable information.\n\nImagine the amount of valuable intelligence that passes over the Wi-Fi networks of Washington, D.C., coffee shops \u2013 or even the networks at government buildings. It only takes one weak link in a security chain for a hacker to get access to those networks and the information passing through them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor example: Some low-level employee who works for the FBI might have a government-issued telephone that is hardened against cyberattacks. But what about his or her personal phone that is connected to the office Wi-Fi while the person is at work? Unwittingly, that employee could be providing a cyberagent access to the otherwise secure law enforcement network.\n\nThis episode was incredibly interesting \u2013 and in some ways alarming. I hope you will listen this week and learn more about America\u2019s secret cyberwar.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "This war doesn\u2019t involve tanks, artillery, or traditional armies.
