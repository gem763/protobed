He said the process was \u201cvoluntary\u201d.\n\nBurundi and Tanzania agreed in August that repatriations of 200,000 Burundi refugees in Tanzania would start on Oct. 1.\n\nThe United Nations and rights groups said they fear the governments may force the refugees to return home to a dangerous environment where they face political persecution.\n\nAfter the announcement in August, Reuters spoke to refugees in camps who crossed the border to escape violence who said there was no way they would be safe back at home.\n\nHundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces since 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza ran for a third, disputed term in office.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, things are not conductive for mass returns,\u201d said Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) in Geneva, said by phone on Tuesday.\n\nHe did not comment on the Burundian official\u2019s remarks, but said refugees must \u201cmake a decision for themselves if the situation is right for them to return or not\u201d.
