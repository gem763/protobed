Their tasks include forging information-technology strategies around cloud computing, data analytics and other advanced digital tools in order to cut costs and reignite productivity, senior IT executives and industry analysts say.\n\nChief information officers at restructured companies looking to jumpstart growth are in \u201can incredible position to drive change,\u201d said Chris Pick, founder of the Technology Business Management Council, a nonprofit trade group for enterprise IT managers.\n\nMr. Pick, chief marketing officer at software maker Apptio Inc., said the spread of digital tools has enabled tech leaders to better track data and gain insights about customers and competitors. That allows them to ask \u201charder, smarter questions\u201d about what needs to be done to breathe new life into a business, he added.\n\nMichael Bailey, Catalina Marketing\u2019s chief technology officer.

His appointment was part of an effort to \u201cefficiently transform the business,\u201d Catalina said at the time.\n\nAmong other benefits, Mr. Bailey said the restructuring removed budgetary constraints that were slowing IT progress, allowing the company to think more broadly about its use of technology. That includes \u201csignificant investments\u201d in efforts to scale computing power, strengthen data security and enhance its media platform to provide advanced targeting and real-time metrics for the company\u2019s retail customers, he said.\n\n\u201cLike any business, costs are considered, but the overwhelmingly consistent goal is to enable Catalina\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Bailey said: \u201cThese are exciting times.\u201d\n\nCIOs are in a unique position to boost productivity, drive down costs, streamline operational efficiency and create new sources of revenue, industry analysts said.\n\nSince Caesars Entertainment Corp. \u2019s largest operating unit emerged from bankruptcy in late 2017, the company has cut the number of internal software applications to 260 from more than 800, thanks to an effort to improve IT efficiency, said CIO Les Ottolenghi.\n\nMr. Ottolenghi, who became the casino company\u2019s IT chief in 2016\u2014a year after the operating unit filed for bankruptcy under mounting debt\u2014said his goals were \u201cto define a technology platform, a unified technology operating system to scale our investments in technology and leverage our data to reduce costs and increase margin.\u201d\n\nTo do that, the company initiated a cloud-first strategy, he said. That gave tech teams more capacity to automate back-office systems and develop new, real-time digital services for customers, such as automated check-in options and virtual-reality casino gambling, as a way of generating revenue, he added.\n\nThere were 5,470 commercial chapter 11 filings last year, down 5% from 2017, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Large cases can account for dozens of filings.\n\nMr. Pick said CIOs and other tech leaders who focus on the right metrics through strong data insights are guiding better corporate decision-making, enabling more companies to achieve goals and stay healthy.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Technology leaders are playing a bigger role in helping companies bounce back after a bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106710/social"}
