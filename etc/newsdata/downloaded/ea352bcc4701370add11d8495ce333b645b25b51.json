You cannot be brutal and lose your head, it's about being physical and brutal and making those good decisions.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Darren Schuettler )", "description": "By Mitch PhillipsOITA, Japan, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Eddie Jones said that George Ford was disappointed to miss out on a starting berth for Saturday's World Cup...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
