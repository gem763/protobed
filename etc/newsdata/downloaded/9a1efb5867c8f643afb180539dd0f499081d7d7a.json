And Trump pointed out Wednesday that Pence had his own interactions with Ukraine's leaders.\n\nAs the Democratic impeachment inquiry focused on Urkaine moves forward, Pence could be pressed to disclose what he knows about the Trump's dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the effort to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's actions show he betrayed his oath of office, the nation's security and the integrity of elections.\n\nWhite House officials deny that Trump pressured Ukraine to do anything and note that the whistleblower said he did not witness most of the events described in the nine-page report.\n\nHere\u2019s how Pence has been brought into the debate:\n\nWhistleblower complaint\n\nPence is mentioned once in the declassified version of the whistleblower complaint, in an appendix giving more information about the events leading up to Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky.\n\nIn mid-May, the whistleblower learned from U.S. officials, Trump instructed Pence to cancel his plans to attend Zelensky\u2019s May 20 inauguration. Energy Secretary Rick Perry went instead.\n\nThat detail was given in the context of officials telling the whistleblower that it had been \u201cmade clear\u201d to them that Trump didn\u2019t want to meet with Zelensky until he saw how the new leader \u201cchose to act\u201d in office.\n\nTrump mentions Pence\n\nAfter the White House released Wednesday a summary of the July call, Trump said the summary exonerated him and reporters should also review an earlier call with Zelensky as well as Pence\u2019s communications with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cI think you should do that,\u201d he said during a news conference at the United Nations. \u201cAnd I think you should ask for VP Pence\u2019s conversation because he had a couple conversations also.\u201d\n\nTrump said nothing of import was mentioned in the calls other than congratulations to the newly-elected Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThey were perfect,\u201d Trump said of the calls. \u201cThey were all perfect.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s remarks prompted some commentators to wonder if the president was trying to tar one of his most loyal defenders with the developing scandal.\n\n\u201cWhy is Trump throwing Pence under the bus? Trying to keep him quiet?\u201d tweeted Jennifer Rubin, a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and a critic of both Trump and Pence.\n\nDemocrat Ron Klain, who worked for Biden and former Vice President Al Gore, brought up a popular game theory example showing how two people might not cooperate, even if it\u2019s in their best interests to do so. The participants may think they\u2019re protecting themselves at the expense of the other person, but instead find themselves worse off.\n\n\u201cIf you had 'fail\u2019 in your office pool on how Trump would play the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game with Pence, you were correct,\u201d Klain tweeted.\n\nPence met with Zelensky\n\nWhen Pence substituted for Trump at the last minute on a trip to Poland this month, he had a private meeting with Zelensky. During a news conference the next day, Pence was asked whether he discussed Biden with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThe answer is no,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe gave a less direct response to the question of whether he could assure Ukraine that a hold up of military assistance was not related to efforts by Trump allies to try to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nPence said Trump had asked him to talk to Zelensky \u201cabout the progress that he\u2019s making on a broad range of areas.\u201d That included, Pence said, steps Zelensky has taken to address public corruption and restore integrity to the public process.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption,\u201d Pence said as part of his lengthy answer.\n\nViola Gienger, a research scholar at the New York University School of Law, found Pence\u2019s response interesting.\n\n\u201cHe essentially demurred,\u201d Gienger wrote in an essay for JustSecurity.org, an online forum for analysis of U.S. national security law and policy.", "description": "The Ukraine scandal enveloping President Donald Trump's administration could\u00a0provide the biggest test yet for one of Trump's most loyal soldiers.", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e9kWgM3V7apL07l6RQZsmA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/7ed2f6a7-bdc2-428d-9873-7993ea474718/d10f8c58-c9c7-58ab-aaa2-484ff5e8abfa/data_3_0.jpg?s=a7b02d5f8610669f9566000d7fcbbfcb&c=62826d1a9c35bf64b31ae36520a0e3b7&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
