The PM and his Luxembourg counterpart had an awkward clash when he visited the country recently and was 'empty podiumed' after refusing to carry out a press conference amid noisy protests\n\nMr Johnson, pictured with Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel to the left of him, insisted 'now is the moment to get Brexit done' after he signed off the blueprint, which deletes the hated Irish backstop\n\nBritish Prime Minister smiles Boris Johnson as he greets Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. MPs face a moment of truth on Brexit after Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU will not offer an extension beyond Halloween if the Commons torpedoes Boris Johnson's new deal.\n\n'Gradually relishing the popularity, Boris starts out using a rather wary eye-checking of Angela Merkel, who is apparently the only leader projecting a more businesslike and tempered mood here as she uses several pointing finger gestures to suggest there could still be some trace of animosity between herself and the PM.\n\n'As the handshakes keep coming though, Boris\u2019s smile widens until we have at least five \u2018sunburst\u2019 creases at the corners of his eyes to suggest genuine delight.\n\n'Leo Varadkar can be seen waiting to get his greeting in, grinning openly as he and Boris perform a high clasp close to their chests to suggest tight rapport.\n\n'Luxembourg PM Bettel\u2019s open-mouthed grin suggests the emotional pasting he gave Boris when he empty-lecterned him recently has been consigned to history and the two men perform a sawing handshake before part-hugging each other in turn like the closest and fondest of old friends.\n\nBoris Johnson and Mr Macron shaking hands and appearing in good spirits at the crunch EU summit on Thursday\n\nBoris Johnson poses with French President Emmanuel Macron, who appears to give a thumbs up during the crunch EU summit\n\n'Boris reserves his strongest friendship rituals for Macron though. He begins by performing his Benny Hill/Fred Scuttle mock salute to make the French leader laugh in recognition before a prolonged handshake that ends with Macron clasping Boris\u2019s hand in a clamping gesture to hold him in place as he greets Angela Merkel.\n\n'Boris did arrive with Merkel so presumably had no need to shake her hand at this point but having shaken with the entire group by then he does seem to offer his hand, which Merkel appears to decline.\n\n'Her gestures suggest she\u2019s interested in the body language interplay between Boris and Macron but the way Macron grips Boris\u2019s hand as he greets Merkel suggests he might have been expecting and trying to prevent some frostiness between the German leader and our PM.'", "description": "The PM was triumphant at the EU summit today as he announced the EU had agreed to his new Brexit deal.
