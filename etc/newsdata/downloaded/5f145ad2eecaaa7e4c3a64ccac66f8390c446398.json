It was 5.9 percent at the conclusion of President Barack Obama\u2019s final year in office.\n\nPrior to Trump\u2019s presidency, the Hispanic unemployment rate had almost never dipped below 5 percent. The only recorded instance was at the height of the housing bubble when it fell to 4.8 percent in October 2006 and then climbed back in the following month.\n\nThe unemployment rate for Hispanic men twenty years and older also set a new record in September, falling to 3.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis and 2.5 percent unadjusted.
