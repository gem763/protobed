The next morning, her nude body was found alongside O\u2019Neil Road, a narrow access road that leads to Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls. She had been strangled and raped.\n\nRenner, 41, hopes more diversity in cases will follow the successful solution of the Blatnik murder. He has his eye on several and has been getting suggestions for others through his group\u2019s website.\n\nThough the effort is new, it\u2019s already garnered much interest and enthusiasm, including from those who have tried not to despair about never knowing who killed Blatnik.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful again,\u201d said Donna Zanath, Blatnik\u2019s sister. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s scary. Now there might be a face to a monster. Before, it was just somebody out there.\u201d\n\nZanath hopes Porchlight Project succeeds - not just for her family - but for others who have long lived with unanswered questions.\n\nThe team\n\nRenner isn\u2019t riding solo in his crime-solving quest.\n\nHe has assembled a board of unpaid but dedicated volunteers who include a print and a broadcast journalist, a true-crime podcaster, a defense attorney, a victim advocate and a private investigator.\n\nRenner says the fledgling effort wouldn\u2019t have gotten off the ground without the help of Alexa Doutt, who does fundraising at Kent State University. Doutt, who has a law degree though she doesn\u2019t currently practice, helped establish Porchlight Project as a 501(c)(3).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I feel good about doing,\u201d Doutt said.\n\nSince Project Porchlight announced Blatnik as its first case earlier this month, the agency has garnered donations ranging from $5 to $1,500, with the biggest gift from Blue Line Unlimited, an Ohio nonprofit that assists police officers and their families.\n\nRenner said Porchlight Project has made it more than halfway to its goal of $4,000, the amount needed to pay for the DNA testing in the Blatnik case.\n\nRounding out the Porchlight team is retired Garfield Heights police Chief Bob Sackett, who serves as a law enforcement liaison.\n\nSackett served on the Garfield Heights police department for 33 years, retiring in 2016. He\u2019s known Renner since early in Renner\u2019s journalistic career when he wrote an article for Cleveland Scene about the unsolved murder of Beverly Jarosz, a 16-year-old Garfield Heights girl who was stabbed to death in 1964. The case remains unsolved.\n\nSackett said he supports the idea behind Porchlight Project because the price of DNA testing could be cost-prohibitive for many law enforcement agencies. He said many of these agencies also don\u2019t have the staff to devote to cold cases.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to work on this big crime from the past, but you have equally big and small crimes that have come up,\u201d Sackett said. \u201cThere are only so many people to go around, and not too many departments have a cold case squad.\u201d\n\nSackett\u2019s department didn\u2019t have such a squad and neither does Cuyahoga Falls. Sackett said he\u2019s pleased the Falls police agreed to partner with Porchlight Project, especially because Blatnik was from Garfield Heights and Sackett would love to see her case solved.\n\nSo would Falls Chief Jack Davis. Unlike Sackett, he hasn\u2019t had any past dealings with Renner, but, when he heard his offer of help, jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really kind of thrilled and hopeful,\u201d said Davis, who has been with the department since 1990. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s nothing to lose by bringing a fresh set of eyes and technology to the case.\u201d\n\nThe technology\n\nThe technology includes a new tool called forensic genealogy.\n\nThis involves taking a suspect\u2019s DNA and comparing it to samples in DNA databases to search for matches that could lead to a suspect\u2019s family members and - eventually - to the suspect.\n\nColleen Fitzpatrick, a forensic genealogist with the California-based Identifinders, has already begun this process with a DNA sample from the Blatnik case. She said how long it takes will depend on what matches are found, how closely these people are related to the suspect, and how difficult it is to narrow down the suspect\u2019s family tree.\n\nFitzpatrick will share her findings with Falls police, who will then see if it leads to a suspect who can be charged.\n\n\u201cTurning a name over - all the genealogy - is just a lead, like a fingerprint or eyewitness account,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cLegal steps still have to be taken.\u201d\n\nIf the Blatnik case is solved, Renner then hopes to tackle three to four northern Ohio cases each year that date back 10 years or more. Potential candidates include Akron teen sweethearts Ricky Beard and Mary Leonard, who were murdered 40 years ago last Saturday; Sandra \u201cLittle Bit\u201d Clark, a prostitute killed in 2007 in East Cleveland; and Renner\u2019s personal favorite - Amy Mihaljevic.\n\n\u201cI would love it if the Bay Village police officers would cooperate,\u201d Renner said, noting that the 30th anniversary of Amy\u2019s disappearance from a shopping center is in October.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For more than 15 years, Akron author James Renner has been writing about Northeast Ohio's most infamous unsolved cases in newspapers and books.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephanie Warsmith"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
