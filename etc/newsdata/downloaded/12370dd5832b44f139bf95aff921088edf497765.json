Illinois congressman Mike Quigley said the complaint, filed on 12 August, was \"based on a series of events.\"\n\n\n\nThe inspector general appeared before the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors on Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to reveal to members the substance of the complaint.\n\n\n\nThe standoff raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump's allies are protecting the president from oversight and, specifically, if Maguire is working with the Justice Department to shield the president from the reach of Congress.\n\n\n\nTrump, while giving no details about any incident, denied on Thursday that he would ever \"say something inappropriate\" on such a call.\n\n\n\n\"The inspector general has said this cannot wait,\" Schiff said on Thursday afternoon, describing the administration's blockade as an unprecedented departure from law. \"There's an urgency here that I think the courts will recognise.\"\n\n\n\nSchiff said that he too could not confirm whether newspaper reports were accurate because the administration was claiming executive privilege in withholding the complaint. But letters from the inspector general to the committee released on Thursday said it was an \"urgent\" matter of \"serious or flagrant abuse\" that must be shared with lawmakers.\n\n\n\nThe letters also made it clear that Maguire consulted with the Justice Department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to Congress in a further departure from standard procedure. It's unclear whether the White House was also involved, Schiff said.\n\nBecause the administration is claiming the information is privileged, Schiff said he believes the whistleblower's complaint \"likely involves the president or people around him.\"\n\n\n\nTrump tapped Maguire, a former Navy official, as acting intelligence director in August after the departure of Dan Coats, a former Republican senator who often clashed with the president, and the retirement of Sue Gordon, a career professional in the number two position.\n\nMaguire has completely refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint but has been subpoenaed by the House panel and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Both Maguire and Atkinson are also expected next week before the corresponding Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n\n\nAtkinson wrote in letters that Schiff released on Thursday that he and Maguire had hit an \"impasse\" over the acting director's decision not to share the complaint with Congress.\n\n\n\nWhile Atkinson wrote that he believed Maguire's position was in \"good faith\" it did not appear to be consistent with past practice. Atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not actually meet the definition of an \"urgent concern.\" And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director's jurisdiction because it did not involve an intelligence professional.\n\n\n\nAtkinson said he disagreed with that Justice Department view. The complaint \"not only falls under DNI's jurisdiction,\" Atkinson wrote, \"but relates to one of the most significant and important of DNI's responsibilities to the American people.\"\n\n\n\nThe inspector general went on to say he requested authorisation to at the very least disclose the \"general subject matter\" to the committee, but had not been allowed to do so. He said the information was \"being kept\" from Congress. These decisions, he said, are affecting his execution of his duties and responsibilities.\n\n\n\nSeveral lawmakers suggested the failure to disclose the complaint's contents amounted to a failure to protect the whistleblower, another violation. However, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote in a letter to the committee on Tuesday that the agency was indeed protecting the whistleblower.\n\n\n\nAndrew Bakaj, a former intelligence officer and an attorney specialising in whistleblower reprisal investigations, confirmed that he was representing the whistleblower but declined further comment.\n\n\n\nConnecticut congressman Jim Himes said on MSNBC that the acting director \"broke the law when he decided to basically intercept the inspector general's report to Congress.\"\n\n\n\nThat's \"never been done before in the history of inspector general reports to the Congress,\" Himes said. \"And the American people should be worried about that.\"\n\n\n\n\"We don't know exactly what is in the substance of this complaint. It could be nothing. It could be something very, very serious.\"", "description": "Donald Trump's administration is facing an\u00a0extraordinary showdown with Congress after\u00a0acting national intelligence director Joseph Maguire withheld a whistleblower\u2019s complaint understood to concern a private conversation between the president and a foreign leader, despite its being classified a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/20/09/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
