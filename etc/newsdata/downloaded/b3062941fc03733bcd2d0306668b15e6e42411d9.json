Much of the media have blasted out the news that Attorney General William Barr is \u201cimplicated\u201d in the Ukraine scandal, after sources said he pressed leaders in Australia, Italy and England to supply evidence about the origins of the Russia investigation. Esquire Magazine was a tad more descriptive, proclaiming Barr was now \u201cfar up s\u2013t creek\u201d because of his calls.\n\nYet not only is there a valid reason for such calls, but they could indicate that the creek could become a storm of sorts for Democrats over the coming weeks. The calls made by Barr were reportedly linked to the ongoing investigation by United States Attorney John Durham into the origins of the Russia investigation. It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials. A call to request assistance for the Durham investigation would \u201cimplicate\u201d Barr in nothing other than an official investigation.\n\nI supported the appointment of a special counsel after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. I also supported an investigation into the origins of the FBI investigation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Turley", "Thehill.Com Opinion Judiciary"], "top_image": ""}
