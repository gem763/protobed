But bringing it to the floor could allow Senate Republicans to formally show their support for Trump.\n\nBut the GOP leader, who is co-sponsoring the measure, touted it during his Senate floor speech.", "description": "Sens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/collinssusan_murkowskilisa_100218gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
