No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\n\n\u2018The media reporting has been inaccurate in many respects. To begin with, Anne fully cooperated with the police and the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n\u2018Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident.\n\n\u2018We have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
