REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\nThe St. Charles, Missouri, and Olathe, Kansas, public school systems appeared to be the first school districts to join the rising wave of litigation against Juul.\n\nJuul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs a result of \u201cyouth-targeted product design and marketing, and years of misstatements and omissions regarding its products, Juul succeeded in addicting a generation of youth to nicotine,\u201d the St. Charles district said in its lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in St. Louis.\n\nThe Olathe district, which sued Juul in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, similarly accused the company of creating a nationwide \u201cepidemic of vaping\u201d and said it had been \u201cforced to expend significant resources combating this public nuisance.\u201d\n\nBoth districts, which are represented by some of the same lawyers, have accused Juul of gross negligence, public nuisance and of violating the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law originally passed to target organized crime that also allows civil lawsuits.\n\nThey are seeking unspecified money damages.\n\nThe schools\u2019 claims come amid a regulatory crackdown on e-cigarettes and a growing number of lawsuits by young adults and parents of teenagers against Juul and, in some cases, its parent company, Marlboro maker Altria Group.\n\nMost of the lawsuits say only that users became addicted to nicotine as a result of using Juul, but some allege serious health consequences.\n\nSome states, including New York, Michigan and Rhode Island, have moved to restrict the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. Massachusetts has gone further, instituting a four-month ban on all vaping products.\n\nOn Friday, a New York judge blocked a state ban on most flavored e-cigarettes from taking effect after an industry group sued to challenge it, while a Massachusetts judge upheld that state\u2019s ban.", "description": "Two public school districts on Monday sued Juul Labs Inc, accusing the company of endangering their students and draining their resources by marketing its addictive e-cigarettes to teenagers.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438247709&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961OC", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
