Since the chamber fills passively and the environmental water acts as a piston, we can create a full combustion cycle with only one moving part, which is the pump that mixes the water with the fuel.\"\n\nThe robot has been tested in a lab, in a lake, and in a wave tank in order to test its abilities in different conditions.\n\nSuccessful trials of the launch and flight technology means it now moves on to the next phase of development, with the hope of eventually building a system that could be used in the real world to collect water samples from disaster zones.\n\nThe team at Imperial has teamed up with the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology in order to begin field trials in a range of environments.", "description": "A \"flying fish\" robot\u00a0that can burst out of the water and into flight has been developed in the hope it can assist in the event of an environmental disaster.
