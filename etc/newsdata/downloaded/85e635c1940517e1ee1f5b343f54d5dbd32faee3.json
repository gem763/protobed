On Tuesday, an appeals court in the state weighed whether to overturn her conviction.\n\nMason\u2019s attorneys are arguing that she cast a provisional ballot, which federal law permits, and that if the state starts to criminalize this, it will undercut the entire system. They called Mason\u2019s prosecution \u201ca threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nIn November 2016, 43-year-old Mason was piecing her life back together: She had recently completed a multiyear sentence for tax fraud and, though still on federal supervised release, had landed a new job, saved her home from foreclosure, and was in school and caring for her children and her brother\u2019s.\n\nWhen Mason arrived at her polling place and learned that her name wasn\u2019t on the list of eligible voters, she accepted a volunteer election worker\u2019s suggestion that Mason cast a provisional ballot.\n\nTexas law says that a person can be prosecuted for illegal voting if he or she \u201cvotes or attempts to vote in an election in which the person knows the person is not eligible to vote.\u201d It also bars convicted felons from voting if they are on probation, parole or \u201csupervision.\u201d\n\nMason has insisted that she did not know of any restriction on her eligibility to vote and that no one, including her probation officer, had told her. Despite her protests, a Tarrant County judge convicted Mason of the second-degree felony last year.\n\nMason\u2019s legal team, led by attorney Thomas Buser-Clancy of the Texas American Civil Liberties Union, appealed.\n\nOn Tuesday, a three-judge panel heard the three-prong oral arguments:\n\n(1) Mason did not vote in the 2016 election because her provisional ballot was never counted.\n\n(2) The prosecution failed to prove that Mason knew she was ineligible to vote.\n\n(3) The conditions of her release from federal prison did not amount to \u201csupervision\u201d under Texas law, meaning Mason would have been eligible to vote.\n\n[Texas woman sentenced to 5 years in prison for voting while on probation]\n\nAt the heart of Mason\u2019s appeal is the state\u2019s provisional-voting process, which is mandated under federal law by the Help America Vote Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002. It says that if there\u2019s ambiguity about a person\u2019s ability to vote, or his or her name is not on the list of eligible voters, he or she may submit a provisional ballot. The vote is counted only if the state determines that person was, in fact, eligible to vote.\n\nIn Mason\u2019s case, Tarrant County administrators determined that her federal supervised-release status made her ineligible to vote. They did not count her provisional ballot.\n\n\u201cThat should have been the end of the story for Crystal,\u201d Buser-Clancy told The Washington Post on Wednesday. Instead, he said, the state misapplied the illegal-voting statute to prosecute her.\n\nProsecutions like Mason\u2019s are extremely rare; the ACLU is not aware of another Texas case of a person being prosecuted based on a rejected provisional ballot.\n\nAccording to HuffPost, more than 12,000 people have cast provisional ballots in Tarrant County since 2014. Officials have rejected about 11,000 of them, yet Mason is the only known prosecution for illegal voting.\n\n[Texans say glitchy voting machines are changing their ballots. The state blames user error.]\n\nUnder Texas law, convicted felons cannot vote if they are on \u201csupervision.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Texas election code does not define \u201csupervision,\u201d and the Texas penal code mentions \u201csupervision\u201d as periods in which an individual is subject to oversight as a trade-off to incarceration. According to court documents, Mason, who was on federal supervised release, had no such trade-off.\n\nBefore casting a provisional ballot in November 2016, \u201cshe served the entirety of her sentence,\u201d Buser-Clancy told The Post.\n\nAs The Post previously reported, in-person voter fraud is considered extremely rare. In 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in a ruling rejecting the state\u2019s stringent voter ID law, found only two convictions for in-person voter fraud out of 20 million ballots cast in the years before the law\u2019s 2011 passage.\n\nConservative groups lauded the Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s Office for pursuing the case against Mason, the Texas Observer reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, the judges asked questions focused on the purpose of the Help America Vote Act, whether a rejected provisional ballot should constitute a vote and whether Mason knew she was considered ineligible when she cast that ballot.\n\nA decision is expected in the next few months, though it\u2019s unclear which way the court will rule.\n\n\u201cThe judges were interested in the case and in the arguments we were making, and were asking questions to both sides about those arguments,\u201d Buser-Clancy said.\n\nIf the appeals court declines to overturn Mason\u2019s conviction, the ACLU plans to petition the next highest court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, to review the case.\n\nRead more\n\nComey violated FBI policy in handling of memos detailing interactions with Trump, inspector general finds\n\n\u2018The reckoning must not end\u2019: Epstein\u2019s accusers urge prosecutors to pursue his enablers\n\nJustice Dept. could be nearing decision on whether to charge Andrew McCabe\n\nLitigation against executive branch by coalitions of states grows in response to unilateral actions by president and gridlocked Congress", "description": "A Texas appeals court weighs whether to overturn Crystal Mason's conviction for illegal voting.", "authors": ["Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Deanna Paul Covers National", "Breaking News For The Washington Post.
