General Assembly and denied impropriety in their call, with Ukraine\u2019s president telling reporters: \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference closing out three days of meetings in New York around the United Nations General Assembly, Trump accused Democrats of launching the impeachment inquiry \u201cbecause they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Biden said Trump put personal politics above his oath of office and that Congress must hold him to account for \u201chis abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe controversy arose after a whistleblower from within the U.S. intelligence community brought a complaint relating to Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy.\n\nEven though federal law calls for such complaints to be disclosed to Congress, the Trump administration has not done so. Members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees were allowed to see the complaint on Wednesday, the day before acting U.S. director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testifies at a House intelligence panel hearing.\n\nThe allegations were \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and \u201cvery credible,\u201d Schiff said after viewing the complaint. Republican Mike Conaway, said, however: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything that bothers me.\u201d\n\n\u2018A LOT OF TALK\u2019\n\nAccording to the summary, Trump told Zelenskiy that Attorney General William Barr, the top U.S. law enforcement official, and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani would speak to him about reopening a Ukrainian investigation into a Ukrainian gas company for which Biden\u2019s son Hunter had served as director.\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said, referring to Barr.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son but has offered no evidence to back up the assertion.\n\nIn the summary, Trump never explicitly told Zelenskiy that U.S. aid was contingent on him investigating Biden, but Trump emphasized the importance of American support before pressing him for action on Biden.\n\n\u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d Trump said. Trump then said German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d for Ukraine but that \u201cthe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAccording to the summary, Zelenskiy responds that Trump is \u201c1,000%\u201d right, thanks Trump for \u201cyour great support in the area of defence\u201d and said he planned to buy more Javelins, anti-tank missiles developed by the U.S. military that are now produced by Raytheon Co (RTN.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).\n\nIn raising the Biden issue, Trump told Zelenskiy: \u201cI heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair.\u201d Trump said he would have Giuliani - a political ally with no formal role in the U.S. government - and Barr call him.\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThere has been no evidence that Biden, who served as U.S. vice president from 2009 to 2017, used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter.\n\nThe front page of a White House memorandum describing President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is seen after being released by the White House in Washington, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Jim Bourg\n\nZelenskiy assured Trump that his next prosecutor general \u201cwill be 100% my person\u201d and \u201cwill look into the situation.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy, a former comedian, then volunteered that the last time he visited New York, he stayed at Trump Tower. He told Ukrainian media later that he thought only Trump\u2019s side of their phone call would be published.\n\n\u201cI also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation,\u201d Zelenskiy added.\n\nAfter Zelenskiy\u2019s promise, Trump invites him to visit the White House.\n\nBARR\u2019S ROLE\n\nTrump never actually asked Barr to contact Ukraine, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, and Barr has not communicated with Ukraine about a possible investigation or any other subject. Barr, a Trump appointee, first found out about the conversation several weeks after it took place, Kupec said.\n\nThe House inquiry could lead to articles of impeachment in the House that could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nPelosi said the notes on the call confirmed that Trump engaged in behaviour that undermined the integrity of U.S. elections, the dignity of the presidency and national security.\n\n\u201cThe president has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nThe summary, not a verbatim transcript, was developed with assistance from voice-recognition software along with note takers and experts listening, a White House official said.\n\nREPEATED SCANDALS\n\nTrump has withstood repeated scandals since taking office in 2017. House Democrats had considered, but never moved ahead with, pursuing articles of impeachment over Trump\u2019s actions relating to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election aimed at boosting his candidacy.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours.\u201d No president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Democrats control the House and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate.\n\nJustice Department officials concluded last week that Trump\u2019s conduct on the call did not amount to a criminal violation of campaign finance law because what he was asking for - an investigation of a political rival - was not a quantifiable \u201cthing of value,\u201d said a senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump has defended his actions in the Ukraine matter as appropriate. Trump denounced the impeachment move on Wednesday as \u201cthe single greatest witch hunt in American history.\u201d\n\nThe United States, European countries and others had pushed for the ouster of the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the energy company because he was not pursuing it aggressively enough. The prosecutor who replaced him, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Reuters on Friday that no wrongdoing was found on the part of Biden\u2019s son in his relationship with the energy firm.\n\nUkrainian officials have not said publicly that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son.\n\nMany Republicans came to Trump\u2019s defence and said the absence of a quid pro quo - a Latin phrase meaning a favour for a favour - in the call showed that the concerns of Democrats were overblown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced what he called the Democratic \u201cimpeachment obsession.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Pat Toomey said Trump\u2019s conversation about Biden was inappropriate but not an impeachable offence. But Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he had read the memo and \u201cit remains troubling in the extreme.\u201d\n\nAID TO UKRAINE\n\nThe United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The $391.5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe whistleblower was concerned that Trump was pressuring a foreign leader to take an official action that would help his 2020 re-election, according to a legal memo released by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nThe Inspector General\u2019s office found \u201csome indication of an arguable political bias\u201d by the whistleblower in favour of a rival political candidate,\u201d but determined that the allegation appeared credible, according to the office.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe Justice Department concluded that the whistleblower complaint did not need to be shared with Congress because the relevant law only covers conduct by intelligence officials, not the president, according to a legal analysis released by the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nThe Justice Department said Barr would not recuse himself from Ukraine-related investigations despite Democratic demands.", "description": "President Donald Trump pressed Ukraine's president to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, in coordination with the U.S. attorney general and Trump's personal lawyer, according to a summary of a momentous telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Andy Sullivan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433795363&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O19Y", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
