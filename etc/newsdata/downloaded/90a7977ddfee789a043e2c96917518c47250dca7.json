But today he is being revered as a bridge-builder not a defector.\n\nCardinal Newman was born in London in 1801 and attended Trinity College, Oxford, going on to become an Anglican priest and a leading theologian.\n\nHe converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism in 1845.\n\nNewman has been credited with two miracles by the Vatican, curing a man's crippling spinal disease and healing a woman's unstoppable bleeding.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The service, led by Pope Francis at the Vatican, also canonised a Swiss laywoman, an Indian nun, an Italian nun and a nun known as the \"Mother Teresa of Brazil\"\n\nThe cardinal was beatified in 2010 by Pope Benedict in an open-air Mass in his home city of Birmingham after the first miracle was recognised.\n\nHis remains lie in a closed sarcophagus at Birmingham Oratory.\n\nThe last English canonisations were in 1970 of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, a group of Catholics who were executed between 1535 and 1679 under laws enacted during the English Reformation.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.", "description": "John Henry Newman is the first English person born since the 17th Century to be canonised.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EA1B/production/_109213995_popefrancsopenair.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
