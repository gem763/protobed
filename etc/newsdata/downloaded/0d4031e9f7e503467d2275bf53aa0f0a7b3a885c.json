I wasn't even OK with saying the word gay,\" Deville admitted. \"I never said it and I was afraid to be who I was. And the only thing that would make me feel more comfortable is seeing [other] people live their truth.\"\n\nAnd although Deville is thrilled to be in the position she's in, she's always striving for greater equality in the workplace and is working with the WWE to have more women take the main stage at an event.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"The ceiling is limitless for women in the sports entertainment industry ... but it's a numbers game right now,\" she insisted. \"The women's division is significantly smaller in volume than the men's division. So it's just getting the talent that we need and continuing to kind of push that boundary and getting it to a place where we feel that we are equal.\"\n\n\"Total Divas\" airs Monday nights at 10 p.m. on E!", "description": "Sonya Deville hopes to lead by example.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/02/694940094001_6091406493001_6091407625001-vs.jpg"}
