Both are urging the president to back new firearms restrictions \u2014 including expanded background checks for gun sales \u2014 insisting he can be the leader who succeeds on an intractable issue that has bedeviled his predecessors and that he can win back moderate suburban voters in the process, according to people involved in the discussions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn the other side, a group that includes Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son and an avid hunter, and a top aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, is telling Trump he risks losing support from his conservative base if he pushes too aggressively on new gun control legislation, they say.\n\nThen there\u2019s Trump, who has heard all of these arguments privately but publicly hasn\u2019t committed to any plan. For weeks, he\u2019s left Washington guessing on whether he\u2019d support any gun control legislation and what form the legislation would take.\n\nThe competing forces have created paralysis with just about everybody involved in the discussions \u2014 most notably senators \u2014 and have delayed the White House\u2019s release of its long-awaited package, possibly jeopardizing the effort to enact meaningful legislation following this summer\u2019s mass shootings that claimed dozens of lives.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. But aides are continuing to meet with lawmakers and gun rights groups. Trump said Sunday he was still considering his options on background checks and accused House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) of wasting time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it right now, we\u2019re studying it very hard, and it\u2019s an issue that, frankly, Congress is wasting all their time on \u2014 nonsense \u2014and we\u2019re studying it very hard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf Congress would get back to work, we could work something, but Congress is doing all of this nonsense, this garbage they're doing, and I'll tell you what, they don\u2019t have any time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Jr. (left), President Donald Trump (center) and Ivanka Trump.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas). Barr, together with Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director and a veteran Senate staffer, met with the senators, according to sources familiar with the talks.\n\n\u201cI would say that not everybody in the White House is supporting the president trying to engage and make something happen,\u201d said Manchin, a key Senate negotiator on gun legislation. \u201cBut he\u2019s still the president, and I think he\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d\n\nBarr has earned rare Democratic praise over his efforts on gun legislation. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a vocal critic of the attorney general, described Barr\u2019s role in negotiations as \u201cconstructive.\u201d Graham, a close Trump ally, also said that Barr has been helpful with the negotiations and has \u201cbeen trying to bring the law enforcement perspective to the table.\u201d\n\nBarr and Ueland floated a proposal, according to two Hill staffers, that would expand background checks to all commercial sales and would create an entity to perform them. But Republican senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said they need to hear from the president directly before seriously considering any action plan.\n\nThose who oppose restrictions, however, are suspicious of Barr, who said at his confirmation hearing in January that \u201cthere\u2019s room for reasonable regulation\u201d on firearms. \u201cWhat I would look for is ... what\u2019s the burden on law-abiding people, and is it proportionate to whatever benefit in terms of safety and effectiveness will be conferred,\u201d he told senators.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be a fool not to be worried right now,\u201d said Dudley Brown, president of the National Association for Gun Rights, which opposed Barr\u2019s confirmation.\n\nTrump described the attorney general as \u201can expert on guns and gun control\u201d and said he asked Barr about a week ago to get involved in Capitol Hill negotiations. The Department of Justice sent a series of proposals to the White House three weeks ago.\n\nIvanka Trump has also been reaching out to senators since the mass shootings. Among the senators she has spoken to is Toomey, who is working with Manchin and Murphy to find a compromise with the White House on background checks. The president\u2019s daughter has also spoken to Blumenthal, who is working on a proposal with Graham that would encourage states to establish so-called red flag laws.\n\nBut Toomey said he was unclear what Ivanka Trump\u2019s capacity was in the talks. \u201cI have spoken with her about it, but I don\u2019t know what role she\u2019s playing at the White House,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/388/1155968404_6069085468001_6069086876001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nOne senator who spoke to the president's daughter about gun legislation said the first daughter made it clear she wanted to do something on the issue, but did not reveal a specific opinion.\n\nIvanka Trump took to social media to urge Congress to \"close background check loopholes\" and expand \u201cthe use of extreme risk protection orders,\u201d or red flag laws, which allow law enforcement officers to temporarily remove guns from dangerous people and spend more money on mental health programs.\n\n\u201cYou can strongly support and defend the 2nd Amendment while calling for these common sense, and long-overdue reforms,\u201d she posted on Instagram on the same weekend as shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe White House declined to disclose details of Ivanka Trump\u2019s meetings, but an official said \u201cIvanka is using her trusted relationships on both sides of the aisle in concert with the president and White House legislative and policy teams to help the White House get something meaningful done.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone in the White House is on board with making substantial changes to gun laws, even as polls show most Americans supporting action after this summer\u2019s mass shootings.\n\nSenators involved in negotiations view as an obstacle Mulvaney\u2019s counselor, Michael Williams, a former law clerk for the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm and general counselor for the American Suppressor Association, which supports easing restrictions on gun silencers.\n\nManchin criticized Williams, saying he suggested at a meeting that a smartphone app could help resolve the background checks issue.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s one gentleman, young gentleman over there that has a complete different philosophy than I have, \u201d Manchin said. \u201cThe only thing I would say to Michael Williams is, 'If you think this technology is so great, let\u2019s do a year study on it.'\u201d\n\nWilliams is also in contact with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the group representing the gun industry. Ueland, however, pushed back on criticism of Williams while on Capitol Hill last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to realize that this president is open to and seeks input across a wide array of perspectives,\u201d he told reporters. He added that picking on individual staffers \u201cis completely counterproductive.\u201d\n\nSome say Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who earned an \"A\" rating from the NRA as well as its endorsement, is also resistant to legislation. \"There are things the government can do and there are things this government is doing, but we are never going to protect everybody against everybody who is deranged,\u201d Mulvaney said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\" after a mass shooting earlier this year.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

They stay home, and he loses.\u201d\n\nThe White House has focused on a series of proposals that Democrats deem too weak, including expediting the death penalty for mass shooters, releasing teenagers\u2019 previously sealed records after they become adults, requiring the FBI to notify local authorities when a potential buyer fails a background check and providing more money for mental health, according to people familiar with the discussions. More recently, staff has focused on changing the definition of a gun dealer and extending the background check review period, they say.\n\nRobin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, a group founded to promote gun control legislation after former Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded, said it\u2019s \u201cfrustrating\u201d that the divisions in the White House are being used as an \u201cexcuse\u201d for why something can\u2019t be done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a valid reason. The America people are on our side,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the president of his base. He\u2019s the president of the United States.\"\n\n", "description": "The president remains noncommittal on a gun proposal as groups around him press their agendas.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar", "Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/1b/f1e02a704c19a064dd7fe5887494/20190922-trump-guns-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
