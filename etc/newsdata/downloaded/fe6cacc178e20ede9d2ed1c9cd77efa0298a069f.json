Along the southwestern border, its work was dusty and lonely.\n\nBetween adrenaline-fuelled chases, the shells of sunflower seeds piled up outside the windows of their idling pickup trucks. Agents called their slow-motion speciality \u201claying in\u201d \u2013 hiding in the desert and brush for hours, to wait and watch, and watch and wait.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The nearly 20,000 agents of the Border Patrol became the leading edge of one of the most aggressive immigration crackdowns ever imposed in the United States.\n\nNo longer were they a quasi-military organisation tasked primarily with intercepting drug runners and chasing smugglers.\n\nTheir new focus was to block and detain hundreds of thousands of migrant families fleeing violence and extreme poverty \u2013 herding people into tents and cages, seizing children and sending their parents to jail, trying to spot those too sick to survive in the densely packed processing facilities along the border.\n\nTen migrants have died since September in the custody of the Border Patrol and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection.\n\nIn recent months, the extreme overcrowding on the border has begun to ease, with migrants turned away and made to wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

An agent in South Texas said some colleagues he knew were looking for other federal law enforcement jobs.\n\nOne agent in El Paso told a retired agent he was so disgusted by scandals in which the Border Patrol has been accused of neglecting or mistreating migrants that he wanted the motto emblazoned on its green-and-white vehicles \u2013 \u201cHonour First\u201d \u2013 scratched off.\n\n\u201cTo have gone from where people didn\u2019t know much about us to where people actively hate us, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d said Chris Harris, who was an agent for 21 years and a Border Patrol union official until he retired in June 2018. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt morale has been poor in the past, and it\u2019s abysmal now. I know a lot of guys just want to leave.\u201d\n\nBy and large, the agency has been a willing enforcer of the Trump administration\u2019s harshest immigration policies.\n\nIn videos released last year, Border Patrol agents could be seen destroying water jugs left in a section of the Arizona desert where large numbers of migrants have been found dead.\n\nSome of those who worked at the agency in earlier years said that it had changed over the last decade, and that an attitude of contempt towards migrants \u2013 the view that they are opportunists who brought on their own troubles and are undeserving of a warm welcome \u2013 is now the rule, not the exception.\n\n\u201cThe intense criticism that is being directed at the Border Patrol is necessary and important because I do think that there\u2019s a culture of cruelty or callousness,\u201d said Francisco Cant\u00fa, a former agent who is the author of The Line Becomes a River, a memoir about his time in the agency from 2008 to 2012. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of oversight. There is a lot of impunity.\u201d\n\nIn El Paso and other border communities, becoming an agent has long been viewed as a ticket to the middle class. A starting agent with a high school diploma and no experience can expect to earn $55,800 (\u00a344,800), including overtime, climbing to $100,000 (\u00a380,200) in as few as four years.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Desperate mothers and sick children had to be herded into fenced enclosures because there was nowhere else to put them.\n\nSome agents blamed migrant parents for bringing their children into the mess.\n\nTheir anger began building under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Then, with Mr Trump\u2019s election, it found a voice in the White House.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. UK news in pictures Show all 50 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

For years, the Border Patrol has quietly tolerated racist terminology. Some agents refer to migrants as \u201cwets\u201d, a shortened version of \u201cwetbacks.\u201d Others call them \u201ctoncs\u201d.\n\n\u201cTonc\u201d may have originated from an acronym referring to unknown nationality, but that is not how it is widely understood these days.\n\nJenn Budd, a former agent of six years who is now an outspoken critic, said a supervisor at her Border Patrol station in California had explained the term to her: \u201cHe said: \u2018It\u2019s the sound a flashlight makes when you hit a migrant in the head with it\u2019.\u201d\n\nAll the agents interviewed by The Times concurred.\n\nJosh Childress, a former agent in Arizona who quit in 2018 because the job had begun to wear him down, said the Facebook posts hinted at a deeper, darker problem in the agency\u2019s culture.\n\n\u201cThe jokes are not the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTreating people as if they aren\u2019t people is the problem.\u201d\n\nCalexico, California, 120 miles east of San Diego in Southern California\u2019s agrarian Imperial Valley, offers a glimpse of the relationship between a border community and the agents.\n\nHemmed in by rugged mountains, desolate desert and the Colorado River, the valley has an economy that revolves around seasonal farm jobs and government work. Temperatures top 110 degrees during the parched summer months.\n\nAbout 800 Border Patrol agents work in the vast El Centro Sector, which runs about 70 miles across the Valley. They patrol on bikes and in their white vehicles in Calexico, whose downtown sits up against the rust-coloured bollards that separate the United States and Mexico.\n\nWhen Mr Trump visited the city in April to tout 2.3 miles of a new border barrier \u2013 a row of 30-foot-tall, slender steel slats with pointed edges \u2013 Angel Esparza organised a binational unity march that drew 200 people. But he said the march was to protest the US president, not the Border Patrol.\n\nMr Esparza has featured Border Patrol agents on the covers of two issues of Mi Calexico, a magazine that he produces and distributes sporadically in this town of 40,000.\n\n\u201cThe Border Patrol agents are part of the community,\u201d he said.\n\nOperating in communities that are often heavily Hispanic and quietly hostile to Mr Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, the Border Patrol has become more openly political than at any time in its history.\n\nAgents have nurtured a strong loyalty to the president, whom many of them see as the first chief executive who is serious about border security.\n\nThe union endorsed Mr Trump in 2016, a move that gave the Border Patrol a line of communication to the White House but has also created friction in Democrat-dominated border communities.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers flocked to the Texas border throughout the spring, many holding news conferences to criticise the filthy, crowded conditions in which migrants, including children, were being held \u2013 some with unchanged diapers, little access to showers and little or no hot food.\n\nAgents said they had done the best they could \u2013 some bought toys for the children in their care \u2013 but were simply overwhelmed by the number of new arrivals.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "One US Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Arizona, said he had been called a \u201csellout\u201d and a \u201ckid killer\u201d. In El Paso, Texas, an agent said he and his colleagues in uniform had avoided eating lunch together except at certain \u201cBP friendly\u201d restaurants because \u201cthere\u2019s always the possibility of them spitting in your food\u201d.", "authors": ["Manny Fernandez", "Caitlin Dickerson", "Miriam Jordan", "Zolan Kanno-Youngs", "Kendrick Brinson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/08/us-border-patrol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
