[Photo/IC]\n\nBEIJING - A recent survey shows that 60.7 percent of Chinese people prefer in-depth travel to short and quick visits to popular sites just to mark their presence, the China Youth Daily has reported.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2,000 people, most of whom are from the post-1980s and post-1990s generations, only 30.7 percent of them like \"daka\" trips, which means visiting a series of popular places like \"punching a card\" just to show on social media that one has been there.\n\nHowever, around 81 percent of the respondents say they know quite a few people who are fond of \"daka\" trips.\n\nOver 57 percent of those surveyed disapprove of \"daka\" trips, saying such trips are only meant to get others' attention on social media and are not experience-oriented, yet 42.4 percent of them believe that \"daka\" trips allow one to visit as many sites as possible within a limited time.\n\nThe survey also showed different opinions on the reason behind the rise of \"daka\" trips, as 62.1 percent of the respondents attribute it to limited leisure time of Chinese people, while 42.1 percent consider an increasing number of new sites the reason.", "description": "A recent survey shows that 60.7 percent of Chinese people prefer in-depth travel to short and quick visits to popular sites just to mark their presence, the China Youth Daily has reported.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/21/5dacf27ba310cf3e97a21efc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
