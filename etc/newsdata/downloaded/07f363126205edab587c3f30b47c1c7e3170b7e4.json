Those malfunctions caused the planes to nosedive, thinking the plane was pitched more vertically than it actually was.\n\nExperts have criticised Boeing's decision to have the plane rely on just one sensor input.\n\nThe plane will not fly again until regulators in the US and around the world approve Boeing's fixes \u2014 a process that most in the industry do not expect to be completed until the end of 2019 at the earliest.\n\nSin\u00e9ad Baker contributed to this report.", "description": "A senior Boeing engineer filed a complaint earlier this year saying executives opted for a cheaper solution, which affected safety.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94b86a62f8d8071127695b?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
