She laughed at his language and agreed with him. \u201cWell said, well said\u201d, was her response.\n\nThe question was about impeachment, something the man is in favor of, apparently, and Harris saw no problem with how he framed it. That is until the backlash began. Now she is backtracking and claiming she just didn\u2019t \u201chear or process or in any way condone\u201d it.\n\nIn his question to Harris, the person said: \u201cI don\u2019t buy that argument that impeachment does not make sense, and like when \u2014 I don\u2019t buy that argument. There needs to be accountability. I mean, what are you going to do in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded action of this guy?\u201d The audience laughed and applauded after the person\u2019s question.\n\nAnd just like that, the backlash came for Kamala. Kendally Brown, a disabled health care advocate, tweeted out the video and a demand for Senator Harris to do better.\n\nUsing \"retarded\" as a slur and an insult is never, EVER \"well said\", @KamalaHarris, no matter who it's against and no matter the larger point being made. It's ALWAYS a betrayal of the disability community. We need\u2014and expect\u2014better from you. #CripTheVote https://t.co/XCQmlcmPG3 \u2014 Kendally Brown (@kendallybrown) September 7, 2019\n\nIn an interview with a CBS reporter, Harris said she didn\u2019t hear him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly offensive term,\u201d Harris said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive and you would think that in the year 2019, people would have a much better understanding of how hurtful a term like that can be.\u201d \u201cI heard him talk about the other stuff and then that came later and it was not something that I really heard or processed \u2026 or in any way condone, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Harris continued.\n\nThe New Hampshire Democratic Party convention was held over the weekend and eighteen of the candidates running for the party\u2019s nomination were there. Kamala Harris continues to show that she is a really bad candidate. She makes remarks and then she backtracks as though it didn\u2019t happen when she is questioned. As Ed pointed out, she is riddled with inauthenticity. She simply doesn\u2019t stand for much of anything. She certainly doesn\u2019t stand by any answer for long. At the first sign of doubt, she caves. And, as in this case, she justifies her weakness with really lame excuses.", "description": "\"I didn't hear the words.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kamala-Harris-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
