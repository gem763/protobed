She started living with her Japanese partner in 2002, a relationship the court took into consideration in making its decision.\n\n\u201cHad she been single, she would not have been awarded this visa. But the government considered the reality of her relation to her partner, rather than its legality on paper,\u201d said Kumazawa.\n\nThe woman tried to legalize her status in the country in May 2016 by notarizing a same-sex partnership agreement but was denied because Japan does not acknowledge same-sex marriages or unions. Some local governments provide certifications for these partnerships but it is not a nationwide practice.\n\nThe Japanese government has been slow in adapting LGBTQ rights. The first openly-gay representative was elected to the country\u2019s parliament only this year.\n\nThe trans community, in particular, has its own struggles. In Japan, a trans identity is considered a \u201cgender identity disorder\" and those who want to legally change their gender must undergo certain required medical procedures. In March, the Human Rights Watch called this process \u201cabusive.\u201d\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "This visa is typically only granted to foreigners who marry Japanese citizens.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f85171da0650008fbb6e7/lede/1567590237611-teddy-osterblom-owiVf9bFKHM-unsplash.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.45xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
