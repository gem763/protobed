He derided the city of Baltimore, where Cummings grew up and lived, as a \"rat and rodent infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\"\n\nCummings responded to the attacks by offering to show Trump around Baltimore to better understand the city and calling it his \"constitutional duty\" to conduct oversight of the administration.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors,\u201d Cummings tweeted in July. \u201cIt is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.\u201d\n\nThe president visited Baltimore in September for a House GOP retreat. He faced protests upon his arrival.\n\nTwenty minutes after his somber message about Cummings, Trump had turned his attention on Twitter back to the ongoing impeachment fight, calling it the \"Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!\"\n\nOther administration officials and Trump campaign officials also mourned Cummings.
