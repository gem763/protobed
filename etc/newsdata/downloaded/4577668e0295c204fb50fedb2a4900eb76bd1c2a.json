At first, he saw our kids and made an effort, but over the past couple of years, he\u2019s been around less and less.\n\nHe\u2019s now even forgetting their \u00adbirthdays, which is very upsetting and I\u2019m left to deal with the fallout.\n\nHe has an on/off girlfriend but they\u2019re always arguing and he\u2019ll move out for a few weeks, so his life is utter chaos. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve met a lovely guy, who\u2019s also divorced, and he moved in with us last year. The children love him.\n\nNow my ex has taken things a step too far. At a school football match recently, he showed up and told our boys that I won\u2019t let him see them, which is nonsense.\n\nI don\u2019t know what he thinks there is to gain from telling lies like this, other than to make me angry.\n\nI, of course, told the children that it wasn\u2019t true and had to bite my tongue from letting rip on their father, but how should I deal with him? I\u2019ve spent the past few years bringing up his sons and resisting the urge to badmouth him, even though I\u2019ve felt like it on many occasions.\n\nMy partner is very supportive and just says I shouldn\u2019t rise to it.\n\nHave you any advice?\n\nColeen says\n\nI think it\u2019s very low of your ex to target your kids like this because he\u2019s got an axe to grind. Ultimately, they\u2019re the ones who\u2019ll end up hurt and confused.\n\nI think it\u2019s right not to badmouth him in front of the children \u2013 don\u2019t sink to his level. But, if I were you, I\u2019d pay their dad a visit one day and tell him politely in front of the children that he\u2019s welcome to see them at any time and that you\u2019ll welcome birthday presents and so on.\n\nThe thing is, the older your kids get, the more they\u2019ll understand and they\u2019ll realise for themselves that he\u2019s the one who has been absent and you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been there for them.\n\nHe sounds unhappy and he might be jealous that you\u2019ve found a good man who\u2019s supportive and who your kids get on with, so he\u2019s trying to hurt you via the children.\n\nI think as long as you\u2019re clear with him and the boys that he\u2019s welcome to spend time with them, then you know you\u2019re doing all you can. And why not ask him if he wants to make some proper arrangements to see his sons on a regular basis? You might start hearing a different story from him.\n\nI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll change his \u00adattitude, but as long as you\u2019re doing the right thing and your kids feel loved and supported by you and your partner, then they\u2019ll be OK.", "description": "I'm trying hard not to badmouth their father, but he keeps letting my sons down and now he's lying to them", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551980.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Anxious-woman-resting-head-in-hand.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
