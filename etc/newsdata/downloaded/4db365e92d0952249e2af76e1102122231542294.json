Mr. Nadler has demanded the presence of several former top Trump aides \u2014 including former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 that, according to the special counsel\u2019s report, were involved in efforts to thwart the investigations.\n\nWhile the resolution focuses mostly on the findings in the Mueller report on the Russia investigation, the committee has also expanded its investigation to include a probe into potential violation of the emoluments clauses.\n\nDemocrats announced in late August that they were looking into Mr. Trump\u2019s offer to host the Group of Seven world summit at his Doral golf club in Miami. They\u2019ve also launched an investigation into Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s stay at a Trump-owned property while on an official visit to Ireland.\n\nSeparately, the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees launched a joint probe into allegations the Trump administration is pressuring the Ukrainian government to help his 2020 reelection bid.\n\nThe committee chairmen contend that the administration is using security assistance aid as leverage to tip the scales in a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a Democratic front-runner in the 2020 presidential election, and prosecute Ukrainians that worked against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nUnlike the Judiciary\u2019s investigation into potential violations of the emoluments clauses, the joint probe doesn\u2019t explicitly link to the impeachment push.\n\nRep. Doug Collins, the top-ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, blasted the move and accused Democrats of circumventing the rules.\n\nJudiciary Democrats are trying to pull a fast one on Americans. They know they don\u2019t have the votes for the whole House to impeach, so they\u2019re trying to adopt committee rules to govern an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d the House hasn\u2019t even authorized.https://t.co/RAJHFLo9wu \u2014 Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 9, 2019\n\n\n\nMore than half of the Democratic caucus has come out in support of an impeachment inquiry, with more than two-dozen of the new advocates coming forward since former special counsel Mueller\u2019s testimony in July.\n\nProgressive activists have been pushing for stronger action on the impeachment front for months, even declaring the summer break \u201cImpeachment August.\u201d\n\nOne progressive advocacy group, CREDO, specifically bashed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for slowing down the process.\n\n\u201cWithout Chairman Nadler setting a date for a vote on articles of impeachment, it\u2019s clear that Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leadership are still putting the brakes on impeachment. It\u2019s beyond time for the House to do more than small-bore resolutions to give them cover,\u201d CREDO Action campaign manager Tha\u00eds Marques said in a statement.\n\nDespite the growing support, Mrs. Pelosi has not publicly shifted her stance on moving forward on impeachment. She\u2019s pushed for a methodical approach to investigations on several fronts, while the party continues to work on their legislative agenda.\n\nA senior Democratic aide, though, told The Times Mrs. Pelosi does support the Judiciary\u2019s resolution and investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
