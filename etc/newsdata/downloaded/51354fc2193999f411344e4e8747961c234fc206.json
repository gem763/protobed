REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - After lowering U.S. interest rates twice this year, the Federal Reserve has reset monetary policy to where it can deliver on its 2% inflation goal despite risks to the economic outlook, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Tuesday.\n\nEvans, like many of his colleagues, had as recently as December thought that with unemployment near 50-year lows the Fed could raise rates to above 3% this year and still achieve its 2% inflation goal.\n\nBut rising trade tensions between the United States and China, geopolitical risks like Britain potentially crashing out of the European Union, and weakening growth in Germany and elsewhere put U.S. business spending and sentiment on the back foot and forced most at the Fed, including Evans, to reverse their thinking on rates.\n\n\u201cI concluded that the situation called for us to cut policy rates 50 to 75 basis points below the long-run neutral rate and then leave policy on hold for a time,\u201d Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery in Frankfurt on Tuesday. \u201cI think this more accommodative stance is needed to support a roughly similar growth outlook to what I had anticipated before and, importantly, to support moving inflation up with greater assurance to achieve our symmetric 2 percent goal within a reasonable time.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s July and September rate cuts brought the Fed\u2019s target range for overnight borrowing costs to 1.75%-2.00%, below the 2.5% that most Fed policymakers view as \u201cneutral\u201d in a healthy economy.\n\nBut rather than mark the start of an extended cycle of rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the reductions represent a \u201cmidcycle adjustment\u201d to policy designed to sustain the expansion.\n\nThough some Fed policymakers believe more rate cuts will still be needed, Evans\u2019 remarks on Tuesday fully endorsed Powell\u2019s view.\n\nEvans also suggested that the current policy setting could be aggressive enough to create not just 2% inflation but \u201ccould well result in inflation modestly overrunning 2% for some time.\u201d But in the face of falling inflation expectations by businesses and households, he said, \u201cthis would not be a policy error.\u201d\n\nIn subtle pushback against U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for the U.S. central bank to slash rates to zero or below, Evans emphasized the limits of Fed policy. Lowering rates, he said, cannot do much to boost the underlying growth potential of the economy, which his staff currently estimates at about 1.75% a year and at risk of dropping lower amid \u201ctoday\u2019s uncertain and hostile trade climate.\u201d", "description": "After lowering U.S. interest rates twice this year, the Federal Reserve has reset monetary policy to where it can deliver on its 2% inflation goal despite risks to the economic outlook, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435810752&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9029L", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
