No other modern American city has worked so hard for so long in so many ways to reinvent itself. It transformed itself from the Smoky City to the Renaissance City in the 1940s, and that was just the beginning. Pittsburghers today refer to that era as Renaissance I because they\u2019re now up to Renaissance III\u2014or maybe IV, depending on how you count.\n\nThe past rebirths enthralled urban planners and put Pittsburgh high in the rankings of \u201cmost livable\u201d cities, but a problem recurred: fewer people actually wanted to live there. By 2010 the population was barely 300,000, less than half its size in 1950. As one of the many who\u2019d fled town, I feared Pittsburgh was beyond revival.\n\nBut in the past decade, neighborhoods have come back to life and young workers are flocking to Pittsburgh instead of fleeing. The city\u2019s comeback has been aided by outside economic forces (like the fracking boom), but it\u2019s due largely to the lessons Pittsburghers learned from their past mistakes.\n\nThe spirit of Pittsburgh\u2019s first renaissance was captured by a painting in 1949 on the cover of Time, which showed the banker Richard King Mellon heroically towering above Pittsburgh\u2019s smoke-filled skyline as a construction crane lowered a golden architect\u2019s triangle on its downtown. Mellon and his fellow master planners were guided by the reigning architectural ideal, Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cRadiant City\u201d with its \u201ctowers in the park\u201d linked by highways, and by the progressive zeal for government-led urban renewal. They achieved some successes\u2014cleaner air and rivers, new parks, new corporate headquarters downtown\u2014but they also obliterated neighborhoods, replacing the street grid with an \u201cersatz suburb,\u201d in Jane Jacobs\u2019s words. \u201cPittsburgh,\u201d she complained in 1962, \u201cis being rebuilt by city haters.\u201d\n\nThe rebuilders\u2019 largest project was in East Liberty, a district known as Pittsburgh\u2019s \u201csecond downtown.\u201d Planners turned it into an outdoor mall in the 1960s by closing the main streets to traffic. They cleared dozens of blocks, displacing thousands of residents and hundreds of businesses to make room for promenades, plazas, large parking lots, a new mini-beltway encircling the district, and three high-rise subsidized housing projects.\n\nMost figured the planners knew best\u2014until they saw the results. Shoppers didn\u2019t want a suburban mall in the city. Restaurants, theaters and stores shut down. As the middle class cleared out, East Liberty became notorious for drug dealing and other crime, especially at the high-rise housing projects, which the police started calling the Crack Stacks.\n\nBy 2000 East Liberty was \u201cThe Land That Retail Forgot,\u201d as a headline put it. But another renaissance was under way, led by a local nonprofit group called East Liberty Development Inc. Instead of grandly remaking the area, it worked gradually, bringing cars back to the streets and coaxing private developers and stores to the perimeter of the district.\n\nMost important, it focused on reducing crime. It worked with other nonprofit groups to tear down the high-rise housing projects and move the tenants into new mixed-income developments. It bought up dilapidated properties in crime \u201chot spots\u201d and hired off-duty police officers to patrol them. Crime fell by half from 2008 to 2012, and property values more than doubled as people and businesses moved back to East Liberty.\n\nThe city\u2019s revival came not from the plan for a Radiant City but from traditional market-based development and the unexpected consequences of philanthropy. The Mellons and other benefactors gave lavishly to local universities and medical facilities, pioneering the urban economic strategy now known as \u201ceds and meds.\u201d Google moved in 2010 into an abandoned factory at the edge of East Liberty, and Uber in 2015 opened its driverless-car research center in a nearby neighborhood with so many robotics companies it\u2019s known as \u201cRobo Row.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get a steady stream of people from California who would like an easy commute and a house that\u2019s bigger than a garage,\u201d says Kamal Nigam, who oversees the more than 600 techies in Google\u2019s office. \u201cPittsburgh is basically the best small city in the country. You\u2019ve got the cultural institutions of a much larger city and great neighborhoods where you can walk to work or to the movies or a bookstore.\u201d\n\nTech workers, who now collect a third of the wages in the region, have changed the city\u2019s politics by electing a mayor and City Council committed to the full progressive agenda. The master planners, it seems, never go away. They only change tactics.\n\nDedicated progressives always know what\u2019s best for a city. In the 1950s, they were sure that neighborhoods could be saved only by demolishing them and erecting towers; today, they fight to prevent change that doesn\u2019t satisfy their idea of social justice. That means resisting the supposed evils of gentrification\u2014never a problem during the decades that East Liberty was desperate for anyone to move in anywhere.\n\nActivists are now busy opposing new development in East Liberty and other neighborhoods, and the city is about to introduce \u201cinclusionary zoning,\u201d which would force apartment developers to set aside units for low-income tenants paying below-market rents. There\u2019s also a plan to impose a progressive checklist of requirements on future projects, like reducing \u201cclimate impact\u201d and providing \u201cwealth and ownership positions for disadvantaged populations.\u201d\n\nWill this new master plan be enough to choke the city\u2019s revival? The Pittsburgher in me hopes for the best. But if people start fleeing the city once again, we can all rest assured of one thing: Pittsburgh will get to work on another renaissance.\n\nMr. Tierney is a contributing editor of City Journal, from which this was adapted.", "description": "Planners nearly killed Steel City, but \u2018eds,\u2019 \u2018meds\u2019 and market-based development have given it new life.", "authors": ["John Tierney"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104260/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
