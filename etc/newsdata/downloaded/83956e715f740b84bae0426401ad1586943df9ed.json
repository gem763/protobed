He\u2019s shown standing over someone who appears to be his wife, who is using her seat and his to lay down.\n\nSome users on Twitter saw this as the ultimate romantic move. Others, however, thought the woman should have just sat normally in her chair.\n\nCourtney Lee Johnson originally shared the photo on Twitter, praising the man for his actions. Johnson, a life coach, captioned the photo, \u201cThis guy stood up the whole 6 hours so his wife could sleep. Now that is love.\u201d\n\nWhile the post didn\u2019t include details on how long the overall flight was, where they were flying from and what airline it happened on, that didn\u2019t stop Twitter users from commenting on the supposedly romantic move. The original post garnered over 3,000 retweets and over 15,000 reactions.\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES MECHANIC ALLEGEDLY TAMPERED WITH PLANE IN MIAMI TO DELAY OR CANCEL FLIGHT\n\nMany users responded with shock and disbelief, with many claiming that they could never do something like that. As one user put it, \u201cHe\u2019s better than me. My legs wouldn\u2019t let me stand that long even if I wanted to. Lol.\u201d\n\nAnother user added, \u201cI\u2019ve never been THAT in love...can\u2019t wait to be so in love that I even consider that an option lol.\u201d\n\nMany others, however, questioned the motivations of the man\u2019s supposed wife. One user asked, \u201cShe couldn't just lie across him?! I won't judge their marriage. My hubs is the kind of man who would do this for me, but I am not the kind of wife to ask this of him!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nAnother user questioned the woman\u2019s motivations, saying, \u201cI can't let my man stand for even 10 minutes. I'd definitely be sleeping on his laps which would even be more comfortable. Or rest properly on the chair. Why would you let your man stand for 6 hours?\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nAnother user took a different approach, noting that there was very little information about the couple\u2019s situation.
