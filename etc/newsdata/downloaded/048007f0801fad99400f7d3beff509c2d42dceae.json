(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nDaniel Hudson first saw the change which now shapes his career two or three seasons ago. The right-hander had given up trying to start after two Tommy John surgeries robbed him of as many seasons. He became a reliever and, not long after, watched teams start building what he now considers \u201cthe modern bullpen.\u201d They established pitchers for the sixth through ninth innings as well as a fireman, who appeared in the toughest jams or for the heart of the batting order. Sometimes they faced one batter; other times, they went more than an inning.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers used star Josh Hader that way, and the Arizona Diamondbacks had Archie Bradley. Hudson was a long man then, pitching mostly when the starter got blown out. Listen to him tell it and you get the impression his transformation into a fireman was a happy accident. Some reliever was unavailable one night, and he filled the role and protected a lead. Then he did it again and again as the situations got later and later.\n\n\u201cManagers and staffs try to ride the hot hands as much as they can,\u201d he said, his tone a shrug.\n\nBut those around him, the ones who watched his meteoric rise to the major leagues, think differently. They weren\u2019t surprised to see Hudson reinvent himself. He pitched well enough for the Toronto Blue Jays this season that, as bullpens across the majors struggled through baseball\u2019s offensive revolution, he became a coveted arm. The Washington Nationals desperately needed relievers, and Hudson headlined their flurry of trade-deadline acquisitions. He quickly became the Nationals\u2019 most important reliever.\n\n[Sean Doolittle has struggled to rediscover what made him successful. So he changed.]\n\nHudson has pitched in every type of high-leverage spot in seven weeks with the team. He started as the fireman, escaping a bases-loaded, two-out jam in his first appearance. Then, two weeks later, he became the closer when Sean Doolittle hit the injured list, converting his first save opportunity. The veteran\u2019s flexibility and ability to excel in either slot \u2014 he has a 2.00 ERA in 18 appearances \u2014 will be crucial for a team suddenly in the thick of the National League wild-card chase.\n\nThe Nationals held a seven-game lead on the top spot two weeks ago, but they\u2019ve since lost nine of 15 games. The surging Brewers won Thursday afternoon to pull within a game of the Nationals and the Chicago Cubs had a chance to do the same later in the day while the Nationals enjoy their last day off of the season. The Nationals didn\u2019t rely on the back end of their bullpen during that losing stretch, but with winnable, must-win games ahead, it will be.\n\nThe Nationals have not solidified bullpen roles, but Manager Dave Martinez reiterated before he left the team this week for a medical procedure that Doolittle will be the closer when he gets back up to speed. The closer\u2019s return would restore order and give each reliever the defined role Hudson says they appreciate. Doolittle closing would allow the Nationals, from the sixth inning on, to use Hunter Strickland as a stopgap, Wander Suero and Fernando Rodney as setup men and deploy Hudson as a queen on the chessboard. Hudson believes this bullpen ultimately functions best without him closing.\n\n\u201cTo get to where we need to go, we need Doo pitching in the ninth inning,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else lines up pretty well right behind that.\u201d\n\nIf the team needs him in the ninth, though, Hudson expressed confidence he can do the job. But he admitted it\u2019s \u201ca different animal\u201d and mentioned how, when he\u2019s out there, \u201cstuff seems to go haywire.\u201d Hudson\u2019s ninth innings are mostly clean, though soft contact sometimes creates hard situations. He thinks those results emphasize a broader point. He can be a fireman, but he called his degree of effectiveness upon joining the Nationals, when he stranded nine of his first 10 inherited base-runners, \u201cfluky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a high-strikeout guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI get a lot of contact, so there\u2019s a lot of luck involved with [stranding runners]. It\u2019s a daunting situation when it\u2019s like that, because I\u2019m trying to limit it to soft contact, but sometimes even soft contact falls in in those situations and, all of a sudden, you give up two inherited runners.\u201d\n\nThat speaks to the pitcher Hudson\u2019s always been. His best pitch, the four-seam fastball at 96 mph, is effective but not overpowering. He doesn\u2019t like watching video, so as a starter he relied on his fastball to feel out lineups. He brought command and composure, and he had a knack for finding holes in hitters\u2019 swings. He \u201cnever parked his brain at the door,\u201d said Jimmy Hunt, his coach at Princess Anne High School in Virginia Beach, with a laugh.\n\n\u201cYou could see him make minute adjustments during games and bullpens,\u201d said Jerry Meyers, who coached Hudson at Old Dominion University. \u201cHe was analytical in terms of finding an edge all the time.\u201d\n\nCurt Hasler coached Hudson during rookie ball in Great Falls, Mont., after the Chicago White Sox drafted him in the fifth round of the 2008 MLB draft. He saw the young, gangly right-hander\u2019s elite location to all four quadrants of the zone. He watched the next year, a little less surprised than the rest, as Hudson flew through the system: Low-A to the major leagues in five months.\n\n\u201cSometimes you see a starter and you think, \u2018How would this pitch play [as a reliever]? Could he get swing-and-miss?\u2019 \u201d Hasler said. \u201cWith Danny \u2026 with the command and intelligence, you can see why he\u2019d flourish as a reliever.\u201d\n\n[As the Nationals\u2019 fill-in manager, Chip Hale brings loads of energy and a dose of humility]\n\nHudson transitioned to the bullpen full-time early in 2015, and he understood he needed to change his mind-set. He couldn\u2019t feel out lineups anymore. Relievers needed their best stuff from their first pitch to dominate a few hitters in high-leverage spots. He scrapped the windup.\n\n\u201cIt just got me to the point where it was like, \u2018These are my guys, I got to go get 'em right now,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201c \u2019I\u2019m not going to face \u2018em again, so let\u2019s just go out there and [throw] everything I got.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTwo weeks ago, with Atlanta in town, Hudson was sitting in the bullpen watching Braves starter Mike Soroka, one of baseball\u2019s best young pitchers. He began his night against the Nationals\u2019 leadoff hitter, Trea Turner, with three pitches: Two-seam fastball, slider, change-up.\n\nHudson had never seen three different pitches to start a game before. He always was told coming up to never show the lineup too much too early. Save your good breaking pitches for the second or third time through the lineup. He understood his new approach to pitching wasn\u2019t new anymore, but now he realized it wasn\u2019t just for the bullpen either.\n\n\u201cGame\u2019s changed for the better,\u201d Hudson said. He likes players who step to the plate to hack. He wants hitters to bring their best stuff, because he\u2019s darn sure bringing his.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nHow the NL Central race could benefit the Nationals\u2019 postseason push\n\nAn MLB player suffered facial fractures after being hit.
