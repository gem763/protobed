Biles\u2019 U.S. teammate Jade Carey took the silver on 14.883, with Ellie Downie of Britain third on 14.816.\n\nThat takes Biles to 23 career world championship medals, equaling the mark set by Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo for any gymnast, male or female.\n\nA year after becoming the Philippines\u2019 first gymnast to win a medal, Carlos Yulo became his country\u2019s first world champion with victory in the men\u2019s floor exercise.\n\nLast year\u2019s bronze medalist, Yulo performed the most difficult routine of any of the eight finalists to score 15.3 and beat Israel\u2019s Artem Dolgopyat by one-tenth of a point. Xiao Ruoteng of China took bronze with 14.933.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "STUTTGART, Germany (AP) \u2014 Simone Biles has won the women's vault competition at the gymnastics world championships to tie the record for most world medals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/3b8a6f_aptopix-germany-gymnastics-world-championships-01666-gold-medalist-simone-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
