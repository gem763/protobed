I recommend that 22 November \u2013 the day he was born in 1808 \u2013 is henceforth marked with a tribute to the Victorian visionary.\n\nMeanwhile, the sudden and wretched disintegration of the most robust brand in travel provides a timely reminder of seven steps to a happy holiday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Book with a travel professional\n\nThis has been the worst of weeks for Thomas Cook\u2019s staff. It has also been gruelling for other good travel agents and tour operators helping customers whose arrangements were wrecked by the collapse: sourcing alternative flights or accommodation, and charging not a penny extra.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Booking a DIY trip? Don\u2019t overcommit at your destination\n\nYou might be happy and confident about sourcing transport, accommodation and experiences online to create a dream trip. But before you commit to non-refundable elements abroad, consider the risk your flight might be grounded \u2013 whether due to the airline\u2019s financial collapse, bad weather or a strike.\n\n3. Pay with a credit card, not a debit card\n\nYou get longer to pay; there is no longer any price disadvantage; and Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act kicks in with financial protection for purchases above \u00a3100.\n\n4. Give cash or promises, never gift cards\n\nAn intricate net of consumer protection means most people who bought holidays from Thomas Cook will get their money back, eventually. But the firm\u2019s gift cards are valueless. Some well-meaning benefactors who used credit cards to buy them may be able to retrieve the value.\n\nBut even when the issuing travel firm doesn\u2019t go bust, gift cards and vouchers restrict choice and impose deadlines. In future please give hard cash or a promise: \u201cA flight and a hotel for a weekend in Rome next May,\u201d for example.\n\n5. Dig out those traveller\u2019s cheques and cash them in\n\nJudging from the questions I have received this week, a surprising number of readers reacted to the sad demise of Thomas Cook by suddenly remembering they some ancient traveller\u2019s cheques in a sock drawer.\n\nThese financial relics were great in the Victorian era but have no place in 21st-century travel.\n\nThankfully Travelex, which bought Thomas Cook\u2019s travel money business, will take them off your hands for a 5 per cent fee.\n\n6. Book late to avoid disappointment\n\nAround 800,000 of us have advance bookings with Thomas Cook \u2013 and many thousands more who bought packages from Tui that included flights with the failed company learned their holidays were cancelled. We are now waiting impatiently for refunds.\n\nThe later you buy, the less that can go wrong before your departure.\n\n7. Go now\n\nDon\u2019t postpone the chance to travel. In this uncertain world, the opportunity may not be there next year. Or even next week.", "description": "Travellers the world over owe gratitude to Thomas Cook.
