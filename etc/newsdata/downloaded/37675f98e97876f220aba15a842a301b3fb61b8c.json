Adam Schiff (D-CA) argued there did not have to be a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nSchiff said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re keeping our focus right now on the president\u2019s coercion of an ally, that is Ukraine, to create this sham investigations into his political opponent. We have discovered in very short order not only the contents of that call but also the preparatory work that went into that call. The effort to condition something the Ukrainian president deeply sought, that is, a meeting with the president, to establish this new president to the Ukraine had a powerful patron in the United States that was vital importance to Ukraine, that was being conditioned as digging up dirt on the Bidens.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere doesn\u2019t need to be a quid pro quo. But it is clear already from the text messaged that this meeting that the Ukraine president sought was being conditioned on their willingness to interfere in the U.S. to help the president. That is a terrible abuse of the president\u2019s power. Whether that abuse goes further, that is the withholding of military aid as leverage. There is certainly strong indication that\u2019s is true as well. We will get to the bottom of it. Here you have a president of the United States abusing his power to the detriment of our national security. And doing so yet to get another foreign country to intervene in our election. It\u2019s hard to imagine more of a corruption of the office than that.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CBS's \"Face the Nation,\"\u00a0House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.
