Investors have been bullish on Hexo HEXO, -5.16% HEXO, -5.74% for a number of reasons, including its joint venture with Molson Coors Canada, which offered the backing of a strong consumer packaging goods partner, they wrote.\n\nSee also: College students are taking their schools to court over campus marijuana use\n\nThe company had a more attractive balance sheet than peers at about C$230 million in net cash, and the Quebec purchase contract was presented as one that would guarantee volumes for years, they wrote. Hexo was awarded a three-year contract in September of 2018 to manage a warehouse and distribution center for Quebec adult-use webstore orders. Quebec is Canada\u2019s second-most populous province with about eight million people.\n\nIn June, however, Hexo management indicated that it would be short-sighted to enforce the contract for near-term gains.\n\nRead: Pete Buttigieg has used marijuana \u2018a handful of times\u2019\n\n\u201cWhether or not this is the right move is debatable, but without the contract, Hexo is relatively undifferentiated versus peers, in our view,\u201d said the note. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement of job cuts indicates to us that the company has not been able to capture meaningful share outside its home province, and we do not believe investors will wait until Quebec\u2019s lack of retail footprint has been addressed.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s announcement of a C$70 million convertible debt offering on Thursday that caused it to postpone earnings was \u201ccuriously timed,\u201d and acts as another question mark, the analysts wrote.\n\nAlso: Cannabis entrepreneur Cassandra Farrington to step down as CEO of MJBizDaily, take on role of chair\n\nHexo will shut down several facilities near Niagara Falls, Ontario, as a result of the layoffs, according to people familiar with the matter. Those facilities were once operated by Newstrike Brands, which Hexo acquired in the spring. Hexo had 822 employees as of April 30, according to its last quarterly filing, and added about 250 more when its Newstrike acquisition closed in May.\n\nFor more, read: Cannabis producer Hexo shutting down facilities amid deep staff cuts\n\nThe news is just the latest in a long line of problems at the company, including a revenue warning issued in early October and the resignation of its chief financial officer. The company is struggling as the rollout of legal cannabis in Canada has been stymied by a dearth of retail stores, due to regulatory obstacles and the slow pace of license approvals. Wall Street analysts have also tamped down expectations for the past several weeks, issuing a wave of price target reductions.\n\nSee now: One year on, Canada\u2019s legal cannabis market is down but not out\n\nElsewhere in the sector, CannTrust shares CTST, -3.76% TRST, -4.60% were down 2.6%, after the troubled company said it plans to lay off 140 people by the end of the year.
