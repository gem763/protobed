The fear of relocation to the nation\u2019s capital was the impetus for ballparks in Pittsburgh and Seattle as well.\n\nThe Montreal Expos were the franchise Washington finally landed in 2005, but if the bring-baseball-back-to-Washington movement had been successful sooner, the Astros might be just a memory for Houston. There would be no 2005 National League pennant for the Astros, no 2017 World Series, no franchise-record 107 wins to celebrate this year.\n\nMaybe that plaque should also mention Bill Collins, the businessman who wanted to bring a team to Northern Virginia. He was the one who put the city of Houston on notice that it was at risk of losing its baseball franchise, and the one who also got MLB owners rethinking their view of the Washington area as a home for the game.\n\nFor a brief period in 1995, it appeared that Collins was about to acquire the Astros and move them to Washington.\n\nThe Astros\u2018 owner at the time, Drayton McLane, who bought the team in 1993, claimed he had lost $80 million over four years while in the outdated Astrodome \u2014 which had opened in 1965 \u2014 and threatened to sell the team unless a new ballpark was built.\n\nWhen his plea fell on deaf ears, he carried through on his threat, making plans to sell to Collins, who by 1994 had revived baseball\u2019s interest in the Washington area by touting the business boom that had turned Northern Virginia into an economic powerhouse.\n\nCollins aggressively sought a franchise after losing out to Tampa and Phoenix in 1995, and he had a deal to buy the Astros from McLane for $165 million. The plan was to play at RFK Stadium for several years until a new ballpark could be built in Northern Virginia.\n\nThere were roadblocks, though. The District had awakened after Collins got the attention of baseball owners and revived its own campaign to compete for the team against Northern Virginia. City leaders wanted to bring a team to the District. Plus there was the hurdle of finding a location and funding for a Northern Virginia ballpark.\n\nThe biggest problem, though, would be McLane getting approval from the other owners to allow a franchise to move. No baseball team had relocated since the Senators left, and Commissioner Bud Selig, who saw the Milwaukee Braves leave his city in 1965 for Atlanta, was not a fan of moving baseball franchises.\n\nWhat resulted was an agreement to hold off on any sale and to put to a referendum vote funding for a new Astros ballpark. Selig made it clear that if the referendum failed, the sale to Collins would likely go through. McLane privately said he doubted the referendum would pass.\n\nBut then the Houston Oilers announced they were leaving for Tennessee, sending chills through Houston, with fans and leaders suddenly contemplating losing both their football and baseball teams at the same time. It was enough to get Harris County voters on board, barely, with a $265 million ballpark funding referendum in November 1996. It passed with 51% of the vote.\n\n\u201cThis will keep baseball here well into the next century,\u201d McLane told reporters.\n\nThat next century is off to a good start for baseball in Houston. And Houston\u2019s decision to hang on to the Astros ultimately resulted in the return of baseball to Washington when MLB owners agreed to the relocation of the Expos in 2005.\n\nThe outcome, though, could have been dramatically different. The Nationals, in a way, will be playing the ghost of Washington baseball past, however briefly, in this series against the Astros.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
