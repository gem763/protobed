The full article is here and a selection of answers are below:\n\nSo what just happened?\n\nIn brief: the bill seeking to put into law Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was passed by MPs on its second reading, the initial opportunity that MPs have to vote on a bill. It passed by 329 votes to 299, the first time the Commons has formally approved a Brexit plan. However, only 20 minutes later, MPs rejected the government\u2019s so-called programme motion, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against.\n\nSo what happens now?\n\n\n\nUnder a backbench-instigated law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until 31 January, despite the PM not wanting this to happen. Responding in the Commons, Johnson said he would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up. For now, the bill is \u201cin limbo\u201d, Speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term.\n\nIs the bill getting pulled?\n\nDowning Street had strongly hinted this would be the response to losing the programme motion. However, this seems to have been a lever to pressure MPs into backing the motion. Speaking during the debate ahead of the votes, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d\n\nDoes all this make a general election more likely?\n\nProbably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could push for an election. Crucially, if an imminent no-deal Brexit was now averted, Labour would be expected to now back an election, making it happen. However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure.\n\nWhat will MPs do for the rest of this week?\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, when they should have been finishing off the stages of the WAB, they will instead return to debating the Queen\u2019s speech. Remember that? The government\u2019s planned legislative programme was presented on Monday last week, but the scheduled five-day debate was suspended for the WAB debate.
