Boris Johnson and those Tory MPs that populate the Cabinet, these are the extreme right who have attacked trade unions throughout their political careers.\"\n\n(Image: Flying Colours/Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \"No MP, as far as I'm concerned, who has the true interest of their constituents at heart can allow that to happen.\"\n\nA Labour source also confirmed to the Mirror that some members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee have discussed ideas like barring deal-backing MPs from standing again in an election.\n\nHowever, sources insisted the idea was only in informal discussion among some members of the NEC and stressed it had not been tabled formally. MPs would also be ineligible to stand anyway if the whip was suspended.\n\nIt comes as Boris Johnson today launches a frantic charm offensive in a bid to get his Brexit deal passed in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Prime Minister returned from Brussels in the early hours to start persuading MPs to back the agreement tomorrow - despite having a majority of minus 45.\n\nMPs will hold their first Saturday sitting since the Falklands War in 1982 after the Prime Minister's new pact was backed by 27 other EU leaders last night.\n\nIn a boost to the PM, ousted Tory Oliver Letwin today said 17 or 18 of the 21 Tories who lost the whip last month were likely to back the deal in the House of Commons.\n\nBut key ally Dominic Raab admitted it will be \"tight\" after 10 DUP MPs vowed to vote against - and warned they will be encouraging Tory Brexiteers to do the same.\n\nThat will force the Prime Minister to rely on Labour votes if he is to have any hope of getting the deal through in Saturday's historic vote.", "description": "John McDonnell refused to rule out suspending the whip from MPs who back the PM - as he begged them \"please do not give Boris Johnson this power\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Leon Neal", "Flying Colours Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20591651.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jeremy-Corbyn-Makes-Healthcare-Pledges-During-Watford-Pharmacy-Visit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
