If you\u2019re a serious national security professional, why stick around when you realize that Trump isn\u2019t listening to you and instead is taking his talking points from a former Army reservist whose main qualification is being a jerk on Twitter? You will leave, and Trump will have a hard time finding anyone decent to replace you. That\u2019s one of the lessons of the text messages found in the investigation into Trump\u2019s July call to Ukraine. One of the diplomats recruited to deal with Ukraine was brought on very reluctantly. Describing the \u201cnew world\u201d of the Trump administration, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a world I want to set foot in.\u201d How many others will decide the same thing and say \u201cno\u201d in the future?\n\nAt some point, we could find ourselves left with nothing but a bunch of Rudy Giulianis\u2014opportunists feeding the president conspiracy theories and promoting their own corrupt personal agendas\u2014and things are going to get way crazier and even more dangerous than they are now.\n\nAnd the responsible adults will leave not just because they know President Trump isn\u2019t listening to them, but also because they know their own reputations are going to be sullied. Usually, even if the public turns against a president, people can still say they served their president honorably. Historically, it\u2019s always been a good resum\u00e9 item to be a former Deputy Undersecretary of this or that. But what if that\u2019s not the case from here on in? What if it\u2019s a source, not only of guilt and sleepless nights, but of professional shame?", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Tracinski", "Thebulwark.Com Trumps-Betrayal-Of-The-Kurds-May-Be-A-Turning-Point"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
