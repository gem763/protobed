You literally hold the phone away from your ear\u2026 That person believed to the bottom of his soul that his assets were worth more than we set.\u201d\n\nOnce again this week, in a decades-old rite of autumn, the 102-year-old magazine will burnish\u2014or bruise\u2014hundreds of massive egos, indulge a collective impulse for financial voyeurism, and possibly even provoke a bit of class resentment by publishing its annual Forbes 400.\n\nIt will also reignite a timeworn debate concerning the accuracy or, more likely, inaccuracy of such rich lists, including the rival Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which has been ranking the planet\u2019s wealthiest humans since 2012 and adjusts its valuations on a daily basis (minus former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2014No. 10 on last year\u2019s Forbes 400, with $51.8 billion\u2014because of a quaint in-house policy that his eponymous financial services and media empire does not cover itself).\n\n\u201c Quite frankly, there was one billionaire who became so abusive that I now have one of my deputy editors dealing with that person. I\u2019ve been screamed at\u2014literally screamed at, like, spewing! \u201d \u2014 Veteran financial journalist Luisa Kroll, who co-edits the Forbes 400 rankings\n\nForbes, meanwhile, has been compiling its own list of the world\u2019s richest people\u2014and publishing its international ranking of more than 2,000 billionaires every March\u2014since 1987, a quarter-century before the appearance of the Bloomberg rankings.\n\nYet, when it comes to personal fortunes derived from privately held companies\u2014such as Mike Bloomberg\u2019s, Revlon billionaire Ronald Perelman\u2019s, or, for that matter, President Trump\u2019s\u2014the numbers are notoriously difficult to determine. One indication of these difficulties is the significant disparity in valuations between several of the Forbes and Bloomberg rankings.\n\nFor instance, Forbes has Jacqueline Mars, of the candy empire, at $29.7 billion; Bloomberg puts her net worth at $43.8 billion. Forbes values Warner Music owner Len Blavatnik at $19 billion; Bloomberg, on the other hand, says $25.4 billion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really purely guesswork and dick-measuring at its finest,\u201d said a person who regularly deals with Forbes on behalf of super-rich clients (and asked not to further identified). \u201cThey will say, \u2018We have research that shows this person gets this amount\u2019\u2014they estimate. They allow you to tweak it. They are wildly inaccurate. There\u2019s no attribution. They never tell you where the client will be on the list.\u201d\n\nA second billionaire\u2019s functionary\u2014again, insisting on anonymity\u2014is even blunter. \u201cIt\u2019s a big fucking waste of time,\u201d this person told The Daily Beast. \u201cThese guys don\u2019t listen. They demand all this information that no one would ever give them and then, if they don\u2019t get it, they just make it up. They\u2019re impossible to deal with.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the journalists who toil on the personal wealth beat\u2014both at Forbes and at Bloomberg, where former Forbes journalists Peter Newcomb and Matthew G. Miller created Bloomberg\u2019s wealth rankings before starting Daybreak, the company\u2019s morning news service\u2014argue that their methods are meticulous, as well as careful and conservative, and in many cases informed by decades of data on individual fortunes.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible, however, to be exact, especially when the money is privately held, as opposed to invested in publicly traded companies, and thus not subject to Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements. If the actual numbers are not forthcoming from the principals, then the list-makers use \u201ccomps\u201d of publicly traded companies in the same or similar businesses to estimate values. Real estate, yachts, private planes, and art collections are also among the assets thrown into the mix.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an art, not a science,\u201d said a person intimately familiar with the process. \u201cA lot of it is precedent\u2014it builds off the existing database and information over time. It\u2019s the same people who have been working on it for years and they understand it. They do have tremendous skill and forensic ability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you were to say to any newsroom in the world, \u2018Go find the 2,000 richest people on the planet,\u2019 they would say it\u2019s an impossible task,\u201d Forbes wealth reporter Dan Alexander told The Daily Beast. \u201cForgive me for being immodest on behalf of my company, but I think the Forbes 400 and the world billionaires list comprise the most ambitious investigative business journalism project that exists.\u201d\n\nYet, as Forbes itself has acknowledged, it\u2019s quite conceivable for an especially creative and shameless billionaire to fool a gimlet-eyed wealth reporter. Trump, for one, managed to get away with inflating his net worth on the Forbes 400 list for decades, using his favorite lawyer, Roy Cohn, and his fictitious PR executive, John Barron (who was actually Trump on the phone), to lie and cheat his way onto the 1984 list, for instance.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s really purely guesswork and dick-measuring at its finest. \u201d \u2014 a person who regularly deals with Forbes on behalf of super-rich clients\n\nIn Timothy O\u2019Brien\u2019s 2005 biography TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald\u2014which prompted the reality-television mogul to sue the author unsuccessfully for $5 billion after O\u2019Brien reported Trump wasn\u2019t even a billionaire but actually worth between $150 million and $250 million\u2014O\u2019Brien wrote:\n\n\u201cDonald and the Forbes 400 were mutually reinforcing. The more Donald\u2019s verbal fortune rose, the more often he received prominent mentions in Forbes. The more often Forbes mentioned him, the more credible Donald\u2019s claim to vast wealth became. The more credible his claim to vast wealth became, the easier it was for him to get on the Forbes 400\u2014which became the standard that other media, and apparently some of the country\u2019s biggest banks, used when judging Donald\u2019s riches.\u201d\n\nAs top Forbes editor Randall Lane reported in 2015, while the presidential campaign was getting underway, Trump personally orchestrated a long-running \u201cepic fantasy\u201d that the magazine sometimes enabled and more often did not. In 1990, after Forbes devalued Trump\u2019s net worth to $500 million from $1.7 billion the year before, he got the Los Angeles Times Syndicate to publish his typically nasty ad hominem attack on publisher Malcolm Forbes, who had recently died at age 70, under the scurrilous headline \u201cFORBES CARRIED OUT PERSONAL VENDETTA IN PRINT.\u201d\n\nForbes\u2019 current valuation of Trump is $3.1 billion\u2014a figure based on his known real-estate holdings against publicly recorded bank loans. O\u2019Brien, for one, argues that the figure is suspect because it\u2019s unclear if the president has secret loan obligations. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham didn\u2019t respond to an email requesting the president\u2019s current views concerning the Forbes 400.\n\nAlso conspicuous among the flim-flam artists who have tried to hoodwink the magazine, and occasionally succeeded, are Trump\u2019s secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross\u2014who personally fibbed to Forbes\u2019 Dan Alexander about $2 billion in family trusts that never existed (in an October 2017 phone call that Alexander posted online)\u2014and Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal.\n\nAs Forbes reported in 2013, the prince would temporarily pump up the share price of his Kingdom Holding investment company\u2014only 5 percent of which was traded on the Saudi stock exchange, where Bin Talal could effectively manipulate the market\u2014in the weeks before the publication of the world billionaires rankings.\n\n\u201cIf someone is really determined to scam us, they can make a pretty good shot at it,\u201d said a journalist on the wealth beat. \u201cBut the stories of those who have scammed in the past\u2014those make people more hyper-aware, and I would say it\u2019s gotten a lot harder. You don\u2019t take many things at face value anymore.\n\n\u201cIf someone comes to you and says, \u2018Here are all the financials of my business,\u2019 you don\u2019t take it necessarily as a given, whereas 10 or 15 years ago people would, and that\u2019s a mistake that has been made by lots of people in this industry. You learn from those mistakes. But if someone is still very, very determined, I\u2019m not going to say we won\u2019t make a mistake.\"\n\nForbes\u2019 Randall Lane (a former Daily Beast colleague) said his reporters are ever-alert to bamboozling: \u201cWe go on the assumption that everybody\u2019s either trying to spin us up or down.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some billionaires would rather not be listed at all for any number of reasons\u2014not wishing to attract undue attention from the IRS, ex-spouses, or charity fundraisers, for instance. On the other hand, Los Angeles billionaire Nicolas Berggruen willingly cooperates with Forbes (which ranked him No. 1425 on the world list, with $1.6 billion, although he wasn\u2019t rich enough to be included on the Forbes 400 as of 2017), because it enhances his profile as a philanthropist and think-tank founder.\n\n\u201cNobody seems to be happy with where they actually are,\u201d Lane added.\n\nOil refinery, real estate, and Gristedes supermarket mogul John Catsimatidis is a rare aggrieved billionaire willing to speak on the record. \u201cI believe they\u2019re undervaluing me substantially, but I\u2019m not gonna argue with them, because who gives a shit?\u201d said Catsimatidis, who was assessed at $3.1 billion and ranked No. 259 on last year\u2019s Forbes 400 list (and No. 715 on the world list), but has been knocked down to $2.7 billion in Forbes\u2019 running online tally.\n\n\u201cThey had me at $3.1 billion for about four or five years now, and I\u2019ve made a couple of billion since then,\u201d Catsimatidis told The Daily Beast, claiming that he\u2019s currently worth north of $5 billion. Notwithstanding that he gave Forbes an interview about his holdings for the 2018 rankings, he insisted, \u201cI don\u2019t deal with them. I let my people talk to them. But I understand that the San Francisco types do not like New Yorkers. I\u2019ll just leave it at that\u201d\u2014a reference to Luisa Kroll\u2019s San Francisco-based co-editor, Kerry A. Dolan.\n\n\u201cI have nothing against them. They got a job to do, let them do it\u2026 I don\u2019t get spun up,\u201d Catsimatidis said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s just when certain people want to reflect the wrong stuff, you look at them and you say, \u2018Eh. Bullshit.\u2019\u201d\n\nForbes\u2019 Dolan responded: \u201cThe main reason Mr. Catsimatidis\u2019 net worth has fallen is that values of publicly traded oil refineries dropped significantly in the past year; we use those as a guide to value his refinery. Forbes asked Mr. Catsimatidis and several people who work for him to provide documentation of his claimed additional assets and they declined to do so.\u201d\n\nA second well-known billionaire who asked not to be further identified said he instructs his team not to engage with the rich lists; he argued that the methodology of both the Forbes and Bloomberg rankings is vulnerable to embellishment.\n\nThe assessments are dodgy \u201cexcept for reported wealth in official documents\u2014SEC disclosures, etc., where if you\u2019re an officer of a [publicly traded] company and you have great wealth, it\u2019s down to the dollar, and all compensation is reported as well, so those are factual matters,\u201d this billionaire told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut for most of the people on these lists, their primary wealth doesn\u2019t come from being a corporately listed player.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the only way that Forbes can get its information is if the people cooperated. Trump is an exemplar. Most people, when they cooperate, put forward a greater figure than reality, because that\u2019s what people do. I doubt people are sending their tax returns or the audited financial balance sheets of individuals. So it\u2019s promotional. And out of that comes the question, why would anyone do it?\n\n\u201cWho would want to, other than for ego? It shows that these people are assertive, egocentric, and generally exaggerators. So it goes to character,\u201d said this billionaire, who calls the entire process \u201cunseemly.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s new rankings will be the 38th installment of the Forbes 400 since it was launched by the magazine\u2019s media-savvy publisher Malcolm Forbes, who celebrated extravagance as a virtue and brazenly publicized his own lavish lifestyle of yachts, private jets, posh estates, hot-air balloon flights, and Faberg\u00e9 eggs until his death in 1990.\n\n\u201c Who would want to, other than for ego? It shows that these people are assertive, egocentric, and generally exaggerators. So it goes to character. \u201d \u2014 a billionaire, who calls the entire process \u201cunseemly\"\n\nHe created his rich list as a promotional gimmick to compete with Time Inc.\u2019s long-established Fortune 500 franchise.\n\n\u201cMalcolm wanted the Forbes 400 to be for personal wealth what the Fortune 500 was for corporate wealth,\u201d said former Forbes journalist Jonathan Greenberg, who worked directly under the larger-than-life publisher on the very first rankings in 1982. \u201cThere actually was a Forbes 500 for corporations, which was very good, but when people would refer to it, they\u2019d refer to it as the \u2018Fortune 500\u2019\u2014which drove Malcolm crazy.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Forbes was considered the No. 3 business mag after Fortune and Businessweek (which was acquired by Bloomberg LP in 2009 and rebranded Bloomberg Businessweek). Malcolm Forbes saw the Forbes 400 as a way to shake up the status quo.\n\n\u201cI think what drove it was celebrity culture, especially in the \u201980s, but it continues to this day,\u201d Greenberg recalled. \u201cThe concept of business people being celebrities was something that was very unknown at the time. In a sense, Malcolm was one of the first celebrity business people. And that publicity was very helpful for him in advancing the profile of the magazine, which became a magazine that wasn\u2019t just dry business news but made stars out of business people.\u201d\n\nThe rich lists continue to exert a strange power over its denizens.\n\n\u201cI am sometimes extraordinarily shocked that these people bother with us so much,\u201d said Forbes\u2019 Luisa Kroll, noting that some billionaires personally have sent her their bank statements while others have emailed her late at night in their efforts to lobby for valuations. \u201cThere are definitely people who could care less, but I find it particularly interesting that some of these people\u2014who really have reached the pinnacle of success\u2014care still.\n\n\u201cI have this whole theory that to be that successful, there\u2019s gotta be something quirky driving you\u2014something that makes you a little bit different. That kind of hyper-drive, or that insecurity, or the desire to be at the top\u2014whatever it is\u2014really drives a lot of these people.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Lachlan Cartwright", "description": "It\u2019s supposed to be the definitive list of America\u2019s wealthiest people.
