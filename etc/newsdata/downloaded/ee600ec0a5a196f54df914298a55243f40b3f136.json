The results were often less than ideal, with Teslas getting confused and behaving in strange ways, sometimes nearly or even actually causing damage to itself or other objects, and pretty much always making everyone nervous. That\u2019s still going on, and will likely continue.\n\nAs with anything Tesla, everything is complicated by the voracity of the brand\u2019s fans and supporters, who are quick to suggest that any videos of less-than-utopian Tesla experiences are fakes created by \u201cshorts,\u201d devious, greedy people hoping to cause Tesla harm so they can make money by \u201cshorting\u201d the stocks, driving prices down so they can be bought and re-sold later for more money, or whatever.\n\nFor example, this drone video of a Tesla owner\u2019s attempts to use Smart Summon provides some great insight into how the car is behaving, thanks to the overhead view:\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward setup: excellent weather, full parking lot but not that much traffic, and yet the Tesla still seems very tentative and makes some odd driving decisions that, at the very least, disrupt the driving flow of the parking lot.\n\nIt\u2019s still impressive technology, but it doesn\u2019t exactly show that technology to be really ready for real-world use. In the end, the owner has to run out to the car to move it and let other cars pass, which makes Smart Summon the ideal choice if you\u2019re too lazy to walk to your car, but not too lazy to sprint to it in a panic when it just stops right in the middle of the lane, blocking everyone.\n\nWhen the video was posted on the Tesla Motors Club forum, some users had responses like this:\n\nand\n\nPeople are actively accusing the poster of the original video of faking it, editing out a driver, though that doesn\u2019t explain the end of the video, when the owner running up would have had to, what, drive off on the allegedly edited-out driver\u2019s lap? And if you were going to fake it, wouldn\u2019t you do something more dramatic?\n\nHere\u2019s another video, where the Model 3 actually manages to scrape its own wheel because it didn\u2019t properly see or differentiate the road from the curb.\n\nIn another test in this same video, the owner takes the car to a crowded parking lot, where people are walking in front of the car with impunity, unaware that the car has no driver.\n\nNow, the Tesla does fine at not running anyone over, but at the same time, it does make one have to ask if it\u2019s really ok for an owner to be involving random members of the general public to be unwitting participants in what is really an experiment with a 1,814kg robotic car?\n\nBusy parking lots are chaotic places, with kids running around and often pets and distracted people\u2014even with the impressive technology Tesla uses here, nothing on this car is actually rated to be anything past Level 2 semi-autonomy (which I\u2019m not thrilled about itself, as you can read here), and that requires a driver to be alert and ready behind the wheel at all times. How is this any different? Here, the owner can be far enough away, with obstructed vision, to the point where they could easily not see the car about to cause actual harm.\n\nEven when the system does generally work ok, it does not behave in a way that humans are expecting or are even often comfortable with. And, when you\u2019re navigating the close confines of a parking lot in a car, driving in a predictable way is absolutely crucial. People need to have some kind of reasonable expectation of other driver\u2019s actions to be safe, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, human drivers do know what to expect from one another.\n\nThis video shows a successful Smart Summon experience, but it still makes everyone involved nervous, and requires the owner to intercede at one point out of fear that the tow hitch on his Model X could impact a parked car:\n\nThis lack of comfort shows up all the time, even in the ones where there aren\u2019t major problems. Look at this video\u2014the owner is clearly enthusiastic and excited, but the entire process is tense:\n\nIt\u2019s stressful because it\u2019s clear the car\u2019s algorithms are barely up to the task\u2014or they at least appear to be that way, filtered through our brains that love to anthropomorphize machines.\n\nThat\u2019s still important, even if it\u2019s not entirely rational\u2014a car that displays this sort of timorous, unpredictable driving behaviour and one that exhibits behaviours counter to accepted rules\u2014in the speed travelled in certain areas, in how close its willing to get to other cars, that sort of thing\u2014makes other drivers nervous, and nervous drivers make bad decisions.\n\nI don\u2019t care if the car\u2019s AI is incapable of being nervous. These have to fit in well with human driven traffic right now, and so far Smart Summon is not doing a great job of that.\n\nThere\u2019s all kinds of questions Smart Summon brings up. Tesla calls this feature a Beta and gives these caveats on their website:\n\nSmart Summon With Smart Summon, customers who have purchased Full Self-Driving Capability or Enhanced Autopilot can enable their car to navigate a parking lot and come to them or their destination of choice, as long as their car is within their line of sight. It\u2019s the perfect feature to use if you have an overflowing shopping cart, are dealing with a fussy child, or simply don\u2019t want to walk to your car through the rain. Customers who have had early access to Smart Summon have told us that it adds both convenience to their trips and provides them with a unique moment of delight when their car picks them up to begin their journey. Those using Smart Summon must remain responsible for the car and monitor it and its surroundings at all times.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure that\u2019s enough. Releasing a Beta of their Netflix streaming or Spotify into the wild is one thing, because if the screen freezes while you\u2019re trying to watch old episodes of Deep Space 9, nobody gets whacked with a slow, lumbering mound of plastic, glass, and steel.\n\nSmart Summon is different. If you\u2019re a Tesla owner and are choosing to try it, you\u2019re involving everyone around you and all their property in your little experiment in not walking to your car.\n\nForbes investigated the legality of Smart Summon in public parking lots, and I think ended up with some very unsatisfactory answers:\n\nThe Smart Summon feature isn\u2019t advanced enough to be considered \u201cautonomous technology,\u201d according to Marty Greenstein, spokesperson for Public Affairs for the California Department of Motor Vehicles, and therefore is not governed by AV regulations. That means that no permit is needed. However, the DMV stated in an email that Tesla needs clear and effective communication to the driver about the technology\u2019s capabilities and intended use. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as using Autopilot,\u201d says Greenstein in a phone interview with Forbes. \u201cYou can use it like you do any advanced driver assistance feature on public roads.\u201d\n\nBut the problem here is that it\u2019s not the same as Autopilot, which requires a driver in the seat, ready to take over, at all times. And if it\u2019s not advanced enough to be \u201cautonomous technology,\u201d why is it ok to send it out, driverless? Legally, this would mean that Ghost Riding the Whip is in the same category as using Smart Summon, and I don\u2019t think anyone is down with ghost riding in parking lots.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Tesla for comment, and will update when we hear back.\n\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to edit people out of cars in videos and alert my broker to buy some cheap-arse Tesla stock. I\u2019m about to be very rich, you see.", "description": "Over this past weekend, we wrote about how quickly people were trying out Tesla\u2019s new Smart Summon feature, part of the recent Version 10 software upgrade, to have their cars autonomously drive to meet them in parking lots.
