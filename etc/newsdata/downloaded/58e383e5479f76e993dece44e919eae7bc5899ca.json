But do I think it's heavy? Yes.\"\n\nMaguire suggested it was difficult to blame Asofa-Solomona for retaliating to an alleged assault on Vunivalu by a patron at a Balinese nightclub.\n\nHe also said Asofa-Solomona's actions showed the strength of the Storm club.\n\n\"People have got to understand that when you're a football team, it is a family. They are like your brothers,\" Maguire said.\n\n\"If you could imagine one of your family members in a similar situation, that's what a football team is.\n\n\"Until you're actually in a situation like that, only you can decide how you'd act.\n\n\"I gotta say though, to support his teammate just goes to show the strength of what that team that he's currently in is all about.\"\n\nAsofa-Solomona's absence leaves a gaping hole in the Kiwis forward pack, which will be led by Sydney Roosters star Jared Waerea-Hargreaves.\n\nAdam Blair and Isaiah Papali'i have also been added to the initial 22-man squad.", "description": "New Zealand coach Michael Maguire has described the three-Test ban on Nelson Asofa-Solomona as", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
