It will also chart her writing career, from the 83 rejection letters she received when she sent out her first book to her gaining the laureateship in 2013. #Merky Books said the autobiography would be \u201cempowering and inspiring\u201d. It described Blackman\u2019s series Noughts and Crosses, which is set in a world where the dominant population is black, as one that \u201csparked a new and necessary conversation about race and identity in the UK\u201d when it was published in 2000.\n\nBlackman will describe how \u201ceveryday racism and bigotry\u201d marred her childhood, and how she was told she could not apply to study literature at university. \u201cIt explores the books [that] have made her who she is, and the background to some the most beloved and powerful children\u2019s stories of today,\u201d said #Merky Books.\n\nThe children\u2019s author said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited and delighted\u201d with her new publisher. \u201cNot only will my autobiography be a full and frank account of my life journey as an author,\u201d she said, \u201cit will also contain all the writer\u2019s tips and tricks I\u2019ve learned over the years.\u201d\n\nStormzy has called the Noughts and Crosses series his \u201cfavourite books of all time\u201d, which \u201cshowed me just how amazing storytelling could be\u201d.\n\nThe grime star\u2019s #Merky imprint is part of Penguin Random House. It publishes two or three books a year and is intended to be \u201ca home for a new generation of voices\u201d.
