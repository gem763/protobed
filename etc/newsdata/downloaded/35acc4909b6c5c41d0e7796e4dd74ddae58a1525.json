Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

This is the area that will be most affected [by Brexit] and where are the leaders representing us?\u201d said one respondent.\n\n'Nobody wants us': fears of forgotten on Northern Irish border Read more\n\nAsked what a hard border meant to them, the responses were overwhelmingly negative. Even those who thought the probability was exaggerated said some disruption was inevitable.\n\n\u201c[A hard border would mean] the end of my world. It will have a severe impact on my mental health. My anxiety is already very high as a result of Brexit,\u201d said one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a knife through the heart,\u201d said another. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a border and we will not stand for one.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cIt would be emotionally devastating. A sense that my country did not care about us at all and was willing to sacrifice the peace and prosperity of Northern Ireland for some nebulous \u2018making Britain great again\u2019. It will cost us our peace.\u201d\n\nA different respondent said: \u201cThings have been relatively positive \u2026 hearts and minds were calmer and amenable. A hard border will wreck that.\u201d\n\nAnother said it would mean \u201cdisaster, pain, the past, broken\u201d.\n\nOthers warned of the business consequences. \u201cI will be out of business overnight,\u201d said one, while others said the political consequence would be a united Ireland.\n\nA handful of respondents, all of whom were leave voters, said that although no deal would not bring any benefits, it would be better than having a good deal \u201cgiven the intransigence of the EU\u201d.\n\nRespondents on the south of the border said that if checks returned they would avoid going into Northern Ireland, just as they did during the Troubles. \u201cWe won\u2019t be travelling into the north, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said one.\n\nThe fear of a return to violence is ever present, according to the responses. \u201cA no-deal Brexit means all bets are off, anything could happen,\u201d said a respondent.\n\nThe survey showed how the border issue is central to people\u2019s lives, whether they live in the north or south. \u201cBecause the border cuts through our parishes, neighbourhoods, farms and homes, it will affect us in every single thing we do,\u201d said one respondent.", "description": "Survey reveals devastating emotional impact as people in area fear return of hard border", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a2275689f0824c63311c55b208d608615efc46/167_107_5772_3464/master/5772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f862cca703451b6e3879370119f7d6c9", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
