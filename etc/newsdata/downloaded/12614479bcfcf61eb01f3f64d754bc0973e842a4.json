Edelman got up holding his rib area. He left the game with about a minute to play in the quarter.\n\nAlso, defensive lineman Adam Butler left late in the third quarter with a leg injury after combining on a sack with Dont'a Hightower. Hightower left in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury.\n\nGiants running back Saquon Barkley left his team's thrilling 32-31 win over Tampa Bay with a right ankle injury late in the first half.

Linebacker Tae Davis departed with a concussion in the second half.\n\nMiami Dolphins receiver Allen Hurns had to be taken off the field after a jarring play at the home of the Cowboys, just as he did in the playoffs last season when he played for the Cowboys.\n\nHurns stayed down for a couple of minutes after a huge hit from Dallas safety Jeff Heath that resulted in an incompletion. While trainers attended to Hurns, Heath knelt on one knee with his helmet off just a few feet from his former teammate.\n\nWhen Hurns sat up, several other Dallas defenders also greeted him. Hurns seemed a little woozy when he stood up, but was able to walk off the field mostly on his own. He was ruled out with a concussion.\n\nAtlanta Falcons safety Keanu Neal was carted off the field late in the first half with an Achilles tendon injury. He missed last season after tearing an ACL in the season opener. Running back Ito Smith left with a concussion in the first half.\n\nColts receiver T.Y. Hilton aggravated the quad injury that slowed him in practice this week and defensive tackle Tyquan Lewis (ankle) did not play in the second half.\n\nDenver Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe left against the Green Bay Packers because of an ankle injury. Wolfe was going for the tackle on a run by Jamaal Williams. Safety Will Parks missed a tackle and appeared to roll into the right ankle of Wolfe, who stayed down a few minutes before being taken off on a cart.\n\nIn other injuries:\n\nBills starting right guard Jon Feliciano did not return after sustaining a neck injury in the first quarter of his team's win over the Bengals.\n\nSteelers tight end Vance McDonald left at San Francisco in the first half with a shoulder injury. 49ers cornerback CB Ahkello Witherspoon went out in the second half with a foot injury.\n\nLions defensive tackle Mike Daniels (foot) left in the first quarter and didn't return and Darius Slay (hamstring) exited in the third quarter at Philadelphia.\n\nEagles cornerback Ronald Darby (hamstring) and left tackle Andre Dillard (knee) left in the first half.\n\nChiefs running back LeSean McCoy aggravated his sore ankle on his touchdown catch in the fourth quarter.\n\nRaiders backup linebacker Marquel Lee hurt his ankle in the first quarter against Minnesota and didn't return.\n\nEric Wilson started for the Vikings for linebacker Anthony Barr, who was inactive with a groin injury.
