It was the right call,\u201d Torre said, before expending a couple hundred words noting why Nationals manager Dave Martinez was so upset about it.\n\nSure, Turner technically ran \u201cinside (to the left of) the foul line,\u201d impeding Gurriel\u2019s ability to receive the throw, as the rule states.\n\nYet, to the fellows on the field playing the game, it comes down to the letter vs. the spirit of the law, and the prevailing notion that so long as the baserunner maintains a straight line, he is within that spirit.\n\nTurner certainly felt that way after bursting from the batter\u2019s box in the seventh inning of the biggest game of his life.\n\n\u201cWhat. Else. Do. You. Do?\u201d Turner asked. \u201cThe batter\u2019s box is in fair territory. First base is in fair territory. I swung, I ran a straight line, I got hit with the ball. I\u2019m out.\n\n\"I don\u2019t understand it. I could understand it if I veered one way or another. I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWith Yan Gomes running from first on the play, the Nationals were prepared for second and third, nobody out, and their best 1-2 punch \u2013 Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto \u2013 due up.\n\nInstead, Turner was ruled out, Gomes returned to first, and the Nationals\u2019 3-2 lead looked like it might stay right there \u2013 with nine more outs to record against the devastating Astros.\n\n\u201cIt was just a lot of momentum taken away in that play,\u201d says Turner, \u201cand I didn\u2019t feel like there was a reason for it.\u201d\n\nAfter Martinez requested a \u201crule check\u201d replay review \u2013 which lasted 4 minutes, 32 seconds and resolved nothing \u2013 Turner, back in the Nationals\u2019 dugout, spotted Torre seated in the first few rows, as is common for postseason games.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t resist, accusing the grand poohbah of all on-field activity of hiding during a pivotal moment of the World Series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably get in trouble for all this,\u201d says Turner, \u201cbut Joe Torre\u2019s in charge of the umpires and I think if we want clarification, we should do everything we possibly can to get the calls on the field right. And if it\u2019s in the rules that I did the wrong thing, so be it.\n\n\u201cBut this stage is too big, too important to a lot of people to have every avenue not (exhausted) to get everything as right as possible and let the players decide the outcome.\u201d\n\nAs it unfolded, Rendon was in the dugout getting ready to hit, and befitting perhaps the chillest man in baseball, he was surprised but not startled.\n\n\u201cOnce they showed the replay on the big screen, then I was like, \u2018Oh,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was a little bit more surprised than I guess I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nAs the Nationals raged, and reliever Will Harris \u2013 perfect to this point in the postseason \u2013 came on, ailing ace Max Scherzer loosened in the Nationals bullpen.\n\nThe plan: He\u2019d come on in a tie game or to protect a one-run lead. And the jarring tones of the bullpen phone kept cutting through the noise generated by the Minute Maid Park crowd of 43,384.\n\n\u201cThe last three innings,\u201d says Doolittle, \u201cthere were a lot of phone calls.\u201d\n\nRendon put the stakes aside and focused.\n\n\u201cYou can't let any outside elements get into the game,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter if it's the crowd. You've got 40,000 people cheering against you. No one is going to feel sorry for you. They're going to expect you to go out there and just perform as best as you can, and they're going to expect the best out of you.\u201d\n\nAs he has so many times this season, Rendon gave the Nationals just that.\n\nHe hammered a Harris cutter into the left field seats, pushing the Nationals\u2019 lead to 5-2.\n\nThe controversial call? Not forgotten, but happily minimized.\n\nScherzer? Just 48 hours after he could not lift his right arm due to nerve irritation in his neck, he happily sat down, ready to save himself for Game 7.\n\n\u201cYou go from thinking you have second and third and nobody out with the middle of the order come up, it\u2019s obviously deflating and upsetting, whether it was the right call or not,\u201d says first baseman Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cTo do what Tony did and to keep fighting and get a couple runs that inning was huge. To be able to calm down right there and get a hit is enormous.\u201d\n\nSays Turner: \u201cIn sports in general, I don\u2019t think you ever want it to hinge on anything other than the players. If the rule\u2019s the rule, then so be it. But you want the players to have an outcome. And I\u2019m just glad I don\u2019t think it had an effect afterward.\n\n\u201cIt makes it a lot easier to move on, obviously, when someone hits a two-run homer.\u201d\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nMartinez, understandably enraged at Holbrook\u2019s call, protested vociferously and was granted a long leash, staying in the game even after the replay review.\n\nYet after Rendon\u2019s homer, between innings, Martinez pushed forth from the dugout, railing at Holbrook and crew chief Gary Cederstrom. Bench coach Chip Hale held him back. Martinez pushed forward.\n\nMartinez was ejected. And kept bull-rushing.\n\n\u201cWe gotta work on Chip. Chip\u2019s got to get in the weight room,\u201d says Doolittle. \u201cHe looked like he was ready to play D-end, man, that he was going to get to the quarterback no matter what.\u201d\n\nYet to the Nationals, Martinez\u2019s tirade meant the world.\n\n\u201cWe were playing in the World Series and had a lead, so we had all the motivation we could get,\u201d says Turner. \u201cBut I love it. I\u2019m a big fan. I think the passion shows, from the whole bench, from that whole situation. I love it.\u201d\n\nThat it came barely six weeks after Martinez was hospitalized and underwent a heart procedure, missing three games in the midst of the club\u2019s wild-card push, only made his players all the more slack-jawed.\n\nThe outburst also came after a Game 5 in which home plate umpire Lance Barksdale\u2019s strike zone was, shall we say, creative.\n\nMartinez on down to the players stuck hard to the talking points of not blaming the umpires. But still.\n\n\u201cObjectively, a couple close ones didn\u2019t go our way,\u201d says Doolittle. \u201cAnd for him to have the team\u2019s back \u2013 it fired me up, Max was fired up. I thought it was good.\u201d\n\nRendon later added a two-run double, setting up this winner-take-all match that seemed destined once the Nationals snagged Game 1 here eight days ago.\n\nScherzer started Game 1, and now he\u2019ll start Game 7, with everything at stake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad,\u201d says Turner, \u201cwe gave him a chance to throw tomorrow.\u201d\n\nA chance no judgment call can take away.", "description": "The Nationals had a budding rally temporarily quashed by a controversial rules interpretation, but fought through the chaos to come out ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/488548a7-99c6-4ec9-993e-60949cc396b1-USATSI_13590574.jpg?crop=2914,1639,x0,y318&width=2257&height=1639&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
