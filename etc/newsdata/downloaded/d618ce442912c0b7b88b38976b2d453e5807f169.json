Though Nat observes how Florence dresses down, favoring \u201cbaggy woolen skirts, flat shoes, no make-up,\u201d virtually every thought he has about her is sexualized nonetheless. Early on, he notes that their relationship is \u201cemphatically non-tactile, with each of us going to elaborate lengths not to brush hands or otherwise make physical contact.\u201d When he asks Florence to join him and Ed for a match with Ed\u2019s sister, Nat notices her \u201cshiny white thighs\u201d in her badminton skirt. \u201cFlorence, you are not supposed to look like that,\u201d he thinks. Later on, when they meet for dinner, he bemoans how a verbal altercation is \u201cour first lovers\u2019 tiff and we never made love.\u201d\n\nLe Carr\u00e9\u2019s characters are rarely unimpeachable. Peter Guillam sleeps with a young woman whom he considers to be his ward. George Smiley, for all his ferocious emotional intelligence, is in thrall for far too long to his feckless wife, Ann. Jonathan Pine\u2019s sloppiness gets a woman killed. In Agent Running, Nat\u2014who is married, though not always faithfully so, and has a daughter around Florence\u2019s age\u2014isn\u2019t creepy, necessarily. His interactions with Florence contain no obvious innuendo or inappropriate overtures. But nor do they allow a young, fiercely talented woman to simply do her job. Nat is astute enough to observe that the SIS is just another old boys\u2019 club, rewarding failure rather than potential, and icing out the agents who could represent its brightest future. What he can\u2019t see\u2014whether due to his own blind spots or his creator\u2019s\u2014is where he\u2019s part of the problem.\n\nIn many ways, the intrigue of Agent Running In the Field is secondary to its function as a renowned author\u2019s scathing indictment of a country selling itself out. Russia, in Nat\u2019s description of Putin\u2019s presidency, is \u201cnot going forward to a bright future, but backwards into her dark, delusional past.\u201d And Britain, with its \u201cminority Tory cabinet of tenth-raters\u201d and \u201ca pig-ignorant foreign secretary\u201d (who, in the world outside the book, recently became prime minister) seems to be following a short way behind. Le Carr\u00e9\u2014through his characters\u2014is particularly caustic when it comes to British leaders\u2019 courting of Donald Trump, a president one of Nat\u2019s former agents describes sourly as \u201cPutin\u2019s shithouse cleaner \u2026 [doing] everything for little Vladi that little Vladi can\u2019t do for himself.\u201d The Brits, the same agent complains, \u201csold me a cartload of hypocritical horseshit,\u201d while cheerfully selling half of London to Putin\u2019s own cronies.\n\nIn the last 75 pages of the novel, the various strands of Nat\u2019s life begin to intertwine in ways that seem inevitable, given the book\u2019s early emphasis on his badminton habit. But the payoff, in the end, is less surprising and compelling than the setting: a country that, in le Carr\u00e9\u2019s portrayal, seems to be decaying from the inside out. Agents Running in the Field captures a Britain whose power, influence, and claims to integrity are shown to be absurdly overblown. Even so, as a new installment in le Carr\u00e9\u2019s canon, the book also demonstrates that Britain is still a potent cultural force. Film and TV producers are more enthused by le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novels than ever, while the author himself\u2014a little crankier, perhaps, than he once was\u2014remains one of the most shrewd and sonorous voices willing to speak truth to power.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
