I\u2019m Martin Farrer and it\u2019s my pleasure to bring you the top stories from the Guardian this Thursday.\n\nBoris Johnson faces an uphill battle to convince the EU that his proposals for an alternative to the Irish border backstop will be enough to enable Britain to leave the bloc with a deal on 31 October. Although Brussels wants to avoid trashing Johnson\u2019s plans in public, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, privately gave a scathing analysis of the proposal the PM set out at Tory party conference yesterday, describing it as a trap. Johnson spoke to European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday as well as the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who warned that the legal texts tabled \u201cdo not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop\u201d. The PM will update the cabinet on his discussions when it meets today but the muted EU reaction will be a blow to Johnson after his rousing speech in which he pledged to take Britain out at the end of the month with or without a deal. There was some cautious support from MPs for his plan but if the plan is rejected by the EU, the government appears set for another clash with Parliament after the Benn Act outlawed a no-deal Brexit last month.\n\nOur columnists are unimpressed. Martin Kettle calls Johnson\u2019s speech \u201ccowardly\u201d while Marina Hyde writes that the Tories \u201cleft no fantasy untouched\u201d. George Monbiot advances a broader argument that politicians such as Johnson are using the language of violence to dominate discourse, while poet laureate Simon Armitage argues that our leaders\u2019 words are \u201cshallow and threadbare\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 4:00 Boris Johnson: the strangest moments from the PM's Tory conference speech \u2013 video\n\nWhisky scotched \u2013 The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on scotch whisky and hundreds of other European agricultural products as well as 10% on aircraft in a significant widening of its trade dispute with the EU. The tariffs could come into effect as early as 18 October and are worth a total of $7.5bn. The list of goods also includes British knitwear, French cheese and wine, Spanish olives and industrial products such as microwaves and camera parts. The US move, which followed a WTO ruling that the EU had given aerospace company Airbus unfair subsidies, spooked investors in Asia where shares fell sharply, compounding losses in the US and Europe yesterday.\n\nTrump tantrum \u2013 The battle over the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump has intensified after Democratic party lawmakers warned the president \u201cwe\u2019re not fooling around\u201d and accused him of trying to intimidate witnesses. Elijah Cummings, the chair of the House oversight committee, said it would subpoena the White House to release key documents on the administration\u2019s contacts with Ukraine by Friday. Trump, who live tweeted a Democratic media conference, called the inquiry \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d and later repeated the claim that House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff should be investigated for treason. He also found time to have a furious row with a Reuters reporter at a White House media conference, replying to a question with an aggressive: \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d. Our Washington correspondent, David Smith, sums up the day by saying Trump had a \u201cfull-blown impeachment tantrum\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dina Asher-Smith celebrates in Doha. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nGold star \u2013 British sport has a new female superstar after Dina Asher-Smith became the first woman from these shores to win a world sprint title, when she took gold in the 200m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha. The University of London history graduate powered home well clear of her rivals in 21.88 seconds and now targets another gold in the 4x100m at the weekend. She will then focus on next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo and promises there is \u201cmore to come\u201d. She faces competition as the standout British athlete, however, as Katarina Johnson-Thompson goes into the final day of the heptathlon in the gold medal position.\n\nArcuri denials \u2013 Jennifer Arcuri, the American tech entrepreneur at the centre of a political row over her friendship with Boris Johnson, has broken her silence to deny allegations that the PM helped her receive business grants and a visa. The businesswoman, who lives in Los Angeles, was quoted in an article by the Daily Mail saying she was the victim of an \u201corchestrated attack\u201d by the media. \u201cAll the allegations are false,\u201d she said, telling the paper that grants of \u00a3126,000 of public money she received for her firm, Innotech, had been awarded appropriately.\n\nHealing hug \u2013 A prosecutor in Dallas has described an \u201camazing act of healing\u201d after the brother of Botham Jean, a black man shot dead in his own home, forgave and hugged his killer, a white former policewoman. \u201cI love you just like anyone else,\u201d Brandt Jean told Amber Guyger in the courtroom after she was sentenced to 10 years for the killing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I hope you rot and die just like my brother did, but I personally want the best for you.\u201d He then embraced her before the judge walked over to Guyger, opened a Bible to John 3:16 and said: \u201cThis is where you start.\u201d Then they also hugged.

Anushka Asthana and Conservative speechwriter Chris Wilkins assess what he had to say.

Our books reporter Alison Flood has been busy sifting through the huge pile of new titles and picks out 10 that booksellers think could do well in the crucial Christmas period, including Zadie Smith\u2019s first collection of short stories, Grand Union, and Philip Pullman on how Lyra handles adulthood in The Secret Commonwealth. Non-fiction highlights include Labour MP Jess Phillips writing about \u201ccalling time on BS\u201d in her book Truth to Power, along with memoirs from Lenny Henry, Wham!\u2019s Andrew Ridgeley and David Suchet.\n\nSport\n\nEddie Jones has resisted the temptation to restore the fit-again Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell into his starting XV to face Argentina on Saturday but both are set to make their comebacks from the bench. Liverpool raced to an early 3-0 lead in their Champions League encounter with RB Salzburg but were pegged back in the second half before Mo Salah scored the winner to secure a 4-3 win on a wild night at Anfield. In France, Tammy Abraham scored on his 22nd birthday and Willian supplied a decisive volley as Chelsea won 2-1 at Lille. David Pemsel, the incoming chief executive at the Premier League, has plenty to work on when he takes up the reins, writes Paul McInnes. Tom Morgan will face charges under the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s anti-corruption rules at a disciplinary inquiry today which could lead to a ban from the sport of up to 10 years. And UK Athletics is facing calls for an inquiry into how much influence the banned coach Alberto Salazar, who mentored Mo Farah for more than six years, has had on athletes in its endurance programme.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe City will be braced for more losses today after Washington\u2019s announcement of tariffs on a range of British and continental goods did little to calm nerves shredded by a week of poor economic data from the US. The FTSE100 fell more than 3% yesterday and is set to open down around a third of a percentage point this morning. Sterling has also endured a rough ride thanks to Brexit in recent days but is steady at $1.23 and \u20ac1.122.\n\nThe papers\n\nSeveral papers focus on the potential reaction from the EU to Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposal. The FT has: \u201cJohnson plan unites Brexiters but faces frosty reception in Brussels\u201d, the Times says: \u201cBrussels keeps Johnson guessing Brexit deal\u201d, the i reports: \u201cEU ready to reject Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan\u201d, and the Guardian says: \u201cDismay in Brussels as Johnson finally reveals his Brexit plan\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nThe Telegraph focuses on the Irish question: \u201cPressure on Dublin to back deal\u201d, the Express is hopeful: \u201cBrexit: Is this the beginning of the end?\u201d, but the Mirror is less so: \u201cIs that it?\u201d\n\nIn other news, the Sun leads on a report that Prince Harry\u2019s statement about the press\u2019s coverage of his wife was issued without the knowledge or support of Princes Charles or William: \u201cRogue One\u201d. The Mail has a story that: \u201cYard faces new probe over VIP sex abuse blunders\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
