USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that President Donald Trump has become a \u201cpotty-mouth\u201d during a conference call to Democratic lawmakers on Thursday that included talk about the impeachment inquiry, according to a congressional aide.\n\n\u201cOne thing, I do want to say is that, POTUS \u2013 you know, that\u2019s the President \u2013 POTUS has become a potty-mouth and children are listening,\u201d she continued, according to the aide. \u201cThis is \u2013 this is beyond disgraceful. But, for him to say the thing that he said about Joe Biden last night was so far beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nDuring a rally speech in Minneapolis Thursday night, President Donald Trump delivered an attack on political rival former Vice President Joe Biden, exclaiming that, \"He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\"\n\nFrequently raising unsubstantiated claims, Trump mostly bypassed his standard lines touting the economy and his get-tough stance on immigration in favor of offering supporters a series of broadsides against the former vice president and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cWhatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he?\" Trump later added. His campaign, midway through his remarks, began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Where's Hunter?\"\n\nGet your Where\u2019s Hunter t-shirt NOW!\n\n\n\n\u2705Made in USA (not Ukraine or China)\n\n\n\n\u2705No Prior Experience Requiredhttps://t.co/irOXuXn8nt \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 11, 2019\n\nPelosi reiterated during her call with Democrats that though she thought ill of Trump's comments, that's not what the impeachment investigation was about, stating, \u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts \u2013 \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 and the Constitution. His policy, his personality, his potty-mouth, that\u2019s about the election and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons.\"\n\n\"The inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office. We will honor ours,\u201d she continued, according to the aide.\n\nPelosi opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump to review whether he pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on the Biden's by withholding foreign aid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the county. But our Constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it,\u201d Pelosi stated.\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, John Fritze, Courtney Subramanian, David Jackson, Jeanine Santucci.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/11/nancy-pelosi-trump-potty-mouth-after-comments-biden/3948731002/", "description": "During a call, Pelosi said Trump comments on \"Joe Biden last night was so far beyond the pale\u201d after Trump said Biden \"understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
