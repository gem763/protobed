(Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nNew evidence from South Africa is adding further credence to the idea that a large asteroid or comet struck Earth during the Pleistocene \u2014 an event that possibly triggered the extinction of many large animals while also disrupting human populations at a global scale.\n\nAlong with locations in North and South America, Greenland, Western Europe and the Middle East, we can now add southern Africa to the list of places where scientists have uncovered evidence of a calamitous event that happened 12,800 years ago.\n\nNew research published this week in the science journal Palaeontologia Africana describes the presence of excessive platinum in sedimentary material extracted from a site in South Africa dating back to this period.\n\nMeteorites are packed with platinum, and an impact with a sufficiently large, disintegrating object would\u2019ve spread platinum across the globe, according to the research team, led by Francis Thackeray of the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.\n\nThis evidence of a 12,800-year-old platinum spike in Africa is the first to be found on the continent, and it\u2019s yet further evidence in support of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.\n\nAccording to this theory, either a comet or asteroid struck Earth during the Pleistocene, triggering an impact winter that saw temperatures plummet around the globe. The associated loss of plant life lead to the extinction of many large animal species, along with possible disruptions to human populations around the world.\n\nThackeray, along with co-authors Philip Pieterse from the University of Johannesburg and Louis Scott from the University of the Free State, uncovered the platinum spike in ancient peat deposits at the Wonderkrater site in South Africa\u2019s Limpopo Province.\n\nLocations where ~12,800-year-old platinum spikes have been recorded on Earth. (Image: Francis Thackeray/Wits University)\n\n\u201cOur finding at least partially supports the highly controversial Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis,\u201d explained Thackeray in a press release.\n\n\u201cWe seriously need to explore the view that an asteroid impact somewhere on Earth may have caused climate change on a global scale, and contributed to some extent to the process of extinctions of large animals at the end of the Pleistocene, after the last ice age.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the time of the alleged impact coincides with the disappearance of many animal species around the planet. Africa was no exception, as the Young Dryas period (12,800 to 11,500 years ago) was when several species, including giant buffalos, zebras, and wildebeest, went extinct.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s evidence from this period that human populations might have also suffered. The Clovis people of North America, for example, were suddenly producing fewer stone tools during this period, and a similar drop in stone tool production has been documented among the Robberg culture of southern Africa.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be certain, but a cosmic impact could have affected humans as a result of local changes in environment and the availability of food resources, associated with sudden climate change,\u201d said Thackeray.\n\nThe new paper also describes the discovery of ancient pollen at Wonderkrater that also dates back to the Young Dryas period. Chemical analysis of this fossilised pollen points to temperature declines, which nicely coincide with a similar cooling period in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAllen West, a retired American geologist who studies the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis, said the new paper is important \u201cbecause it suggests that the Younger Dryas impact event had global effects.\u201d\n\nPreviously, scientists \u201cknew that it affected nearly all of the Northern Hemisphere, but not the South,\u201d he wrote to Gizmodo. \u201cThen, recently, another study was published showing a platinum peak at Pilauco, Chile, indicating that South America was affected. Now, we know that southern Africa was affected as well, nearly 8,000 kilometers [5,000 miles] away from the nearest similar site in Syria, making this a global event.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis is a highly controversial idea, given the lack of evidence. Critics have said an \u201can age discrepancy\u201d exists \u201cbetween different sites where proposed impact markers have been found, and that much of the evidence, such as magnetic microspherules, nanodiamonds, shocked quartz, and other minerals, are ambiguous in nature and open to interpretation. It also doesn\u2019t help that an associated impact crater hasn\u2019t been linked to the supposed event.\n\nThat said, a fascinating discovery from 2018 revealed the presence of a hidden impact crater beneath the Hiawatha Glacier in Greenland.\n\nThis crater measures around 31 kilometres wide, and it struck the Earth at some point between 3 million and 12,000 years ago. This could very well be the impact crater from the Young Dryas event, but more evidence is needed. When Gizmodo covered the discovery of this crater last year, we asked Nicolaj Larsen, an Aarhus University geologist who contributed to the discovery, to explain the rather sizeable dating discrepancy:\n\nIt is correct that the crater is not well dated, but there\u2019s good evidence that it is geologically young, that is, it formed within the last 2 to 3 million years, and most likely it is as young as the last Ice Age [which ended around 12,000 years ago]. We are currently trying to come up with ideas on how to date the impact. One idea is to drill through the ice and get bedrock samples that can be used for numerical dating.\n\nNailing down a tighter date would be helpful as far as the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis is concerned. Unsurprisingly, Thackeray already has eyes on this crater, saying \u201cit might possibly have been the very place where a large meteorite struck the planet Earth 12,800 years ago,\u201d and that a meteorite of this size would have mostly certainly resulted in \u201cglobal consequences.\u201d\n\nSo, still no sure-fire confirmation that Earth got hit back then, but this possibility continues to intrigue.", "description": "New evidence from South Africa is adding further credence to the idea that a large asteroid or comet struck Earth during the Pleistocene \u2014 an event that possibly triggered the extinction of many large animals while also disrupting human populations at a global scale....", "authors": ["George Dvorsky", "Victoria Song"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/i3beiyr9izwiguzhc1xl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
