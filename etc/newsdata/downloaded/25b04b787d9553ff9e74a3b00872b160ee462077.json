For the first time, the First Girlfriend \u2014 at 31, little more than half his age \u2014 was on parade.\n\nShe chose a bright pink, ruffled dress for the leader\u2019s speech \u2014 it was spot on: demure, with its high collar and below-knee hem, but also colourful. And because they are not husband and wife, she sensibly broke with convention, remaining in her seat to applaud Boris\u2019s speech, rather than rushing up to the stage as spouses have in the past.\n\nHer moment came after Boris made his way to Carrie in the front row. A hug and a kiss, the couple\u2019s first public display of affection.\n\nThen they went walkabout \u2014 and Carrie was clinging on to Boris\u2019s arm like a survivor of the Titanic. She was at points clutching him with both hands, as if fearful he might escape. And, of course, that is exactly what he has done from so many women in the past. Crikey, the intricacies of Boris\u2019s personal life are more complex than the Irish backstop! The trouble is that Carrie, however well she plays her part in public, is a constant reminder that Boris has a women problem.\n\nA reminder that he left Marina, his wife of 25 years, for her and that his children have not forgiven him for it. A reminder that he simply can\u2019t help himself.\n\nIt makes an already wary female voting population wonder if he is a man to be trusted, which bodes badly for the inevitable forthcoming election. A poll last week showed female voters are more likely to describe Boris as \u2018dislikeable\u2019 and \u2018out of touch\u2019 \u2014 than men.\n\nI fervently believe Boris is the man who can take us out of the EU, and our nation is infinitely safer in the hands of a Conservative government led by him than a government led by the odious Marxist Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nBut in the election every vote will count. And in a world where women voters could shun Boris on account of his peccadilloes, the less we see of cling-on Carrie the better.\n\nFending off questions about gratuitous groping, Boris Johnson said he wanted to talk about buses. More buses, safer buses, with easy payments \u2014 indeed they would all be contactless. That would come as a relief to female passengers in his orbit.\n\nTrack stars' golden role\n\nDina Asher-Smith won gold at the world athletics championships in Doha\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson and Dina Asher-Smith. They\u2019re not household names \u2014 yet.\n\nBoth women won record-breaking gold medals at the world athletics championships in Doha.\n\nWith the support of their families and through ambition and willpower, they have overcome setbacks and injuries, disappointments and defeat to triumph in stunning style.\n\nWhile a generation of snowflakes fall at the first hurdle, these two are magnificent role models for any girl.\n\nSpare us Game of Moans, Masie\n\nMaisie Williams, 22, played the pre-pubescent, androgynous assassin Arya Stark\n\nGame Of Thrones actress Maisie Williams, 22, says she\u2019s now \u2018ashamed\u2019 that, to keep her in character as a pre-pubescent, androgynous assassin, producers made the then teenager conceal her breasts and have short hair.\n\nOh get over yourself, dear. It\u2019s called acting.\n\nMaisie says that only now can she \u2018embrace the body I have\u2019.\n\nAs well as the millions she\u2019s made from the hit TV series.\n\nWham!\u2019s Andrew Ridgeley recalls the moment he learnt of the death of his friend. George Michael\u2019s sister Melanie called him at Christmas to say: \u2018Andrew, I hate to tell you this, but George has died.\u2019\n\nRidgeley writes in his autobiography Wham! George & Me: \u2018I can\u2019t imagine how hard that must be for her to have to call so many people and tell them the dreadful news.\u2019\n\nI can. After my brother Michael died on Boxing Day, Dad asked me to do exactly that. And it was breaking the news to others that made his death finally and devastatingly real.\n\nA dream come true for a couple whose wedding plans fell through after their Thomas Cook flights were cancelled.\n\nNot only did the hotel they\u2019d booked arrange to fly Sharon Cook and fiance Andrew Aitchison to Las Vegas for their nuptials, fellow hotel guest Sir Rod Stewart, 74, also turned up to serenade them with Have I Told You Lately That I Love You.\n\nWhat a trouper \u2014 he should have followed up with This (Big) Old Heart Of Mine.\n\nJodie a cut above\n\nAfter Jodie Comer won the Emmy best actress award for the assassin Villanelle in Killing Eve, the thriller\u2019s writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge proclaimed she is a \u2018once in a generation actress\u2019.\n\nDespite being inundated with offers from Hollywood, the 26-year-old still lives at home in Liverpool with her mum and dad and vows she will never let fame change her. Jolly good, but living with Villanelle, I\u2019d be hiding all the kitchen knives \u2014 even if I was family.\n\nAfter Jodie Comer won the Emmy best actress award for the assassin Villanelle in Killing Eve, the thriller\u2019s writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge proclaimed she is a \u2018once in a generation actress\u2019\n\nHot on the heels of The Goldfinch, her latest turkey of a movie, workaholic mum-of-four Nicole Kidman says she\u2019s taking time out to be \u2018the mother I need to be\u2019.\n\nEr, a bit late given that her two daughters Sunday and Faith with husband Keith Urban are 11 and eight years old. And her two children with Tom Cruise, Connor and Isabella, who she hardly sees, are in their 20s. Or is it simply that the movie offers are drying up, Nicole?\n\nGlum is dumb Leo\n\nThe Irish premier Leo Varadkar did a ludicrous impersonation of a glum emoji \u2014 more hammed up than any meat counter \u2014 when he dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s offer of a deal out of hand, outrageously declaring most Brits really want to stay in the EU after all.\n\nJust one question: where\u2019s the \u2018pass-the-sick-bag\u2019 emoji when you need it?\n\nThe Irish premier Leo Varadkar did a ludicrous impersonation of a glum emoji, writes AMANDA PLATELL\n\nWestminster wars Most humbling moment of the Tory conference was when a tearful Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to his former seamstress Pakistani mother Zubaid sitting in the front row. In Punjabi he said: \u2018Mum, did you ever think we\u2019d be here?\u2019 There is no sweeter moment for any child, however old, to be able to say, in whatever language: \u2018Thanks Mum.\u2019 In her conference speech Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Ugandan-Asian refugees, was channelling Margaret Thatcher, reminding us that she too was brought up over the shop her parents ran. She\u2019d had an Eva Peron make-over with scraped-back hair and chic designer suit. Priti is tipped as the next female Conservative leader and unrecognisable from the Tory office manager I worked with two decades ago. And to think I used to be her boss.\n\nHarry's harrumph\n\nThe most striking images from Africa were of Meghan hugging children, dancing in harmony with the girls she wants to empower\n\nOnly the hardest of hearts would not have been moved when Prince Harry walked in his mother\u2019s footsteps in the Angolan minefields, 22 years after her death.\n\nHe was the embodiment of Diana\u2019s spirit. But so too was his new wife on their tour.\n\nThe most striking images from Africa were of Meghan hugging children, dancing not in Dior but dressed down and in harmony with the girls she wants to empower \u2014 completely endearing and with an empathy the mother-in-law she never met would have been proud of.\n\nSo what a shame Harry eclipsed his wife\u2019s magic moments with an ill-judged attack on the media, who had beamed those beatific pictures of Mrs Wales worldwide.\n\nHats off, or should that be crowns, to Dame Helen Mirren, 74, in the TV series Catherine The Great, bedding a boy young enough to be her grandson. Although after the act, she did have that older woman\u2019s combined look of utter boredom and disdain \u2014 probably over the three wasted minutes of her life she will never get back.", "description": "AMANDA PLATELL: This cannot have been an easy week for the Prime Minister's partner, Carrie Symonds.
