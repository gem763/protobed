The company is scheduled to announce Q2 earnings results today after the market close.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate is for a loss of $.18 on revenue of $141.27 million. With less than three full months of trading history, let's see what we can glean from two charts and our favorite indicators.\n\nIn this daily Japanese candlestick chart of WORK, below, we can see that prices have been in a downtrend from late June when the company went public. Red candles dominate the chart telling us that on most days the close has been lower than the opening and sellers have been in charge.\n\nThe slope of the 20-day moving average line is negative or bearish and the line has proved to act as resistance during this short period of time. The limited 50-day moving average line also has a negative slope. Trading volume has been light when compared to the heavy turnover of the first trade day.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has declined from June which tells us that sellers have been more aggressive. In the lower panel is the 12-day price momentum study which shows higher lows from July suggesting that the decline is slowing.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of WORK, below, we can see the downtrend. Prices made a new low for the move down and a trade at $30.41 is needed, in my opinion, to improve the chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: Slowing price momentum and some lower shadows on the candle chart suggest that prices may react on the upside to Slack's upcoming earning's report.", "description": "Let's see what we can glean from two charts and our favorite indicators....WORK", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Slack Appears Likely To Bounce After Wednesday'S Earnings Report", "Let'S See What We Can Glean Two Charts", "Our Favorite Indicators.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Guy Ortmann"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1dfe6f1e-cf14-11e9-805f-756b4de467b7.jpg"}
