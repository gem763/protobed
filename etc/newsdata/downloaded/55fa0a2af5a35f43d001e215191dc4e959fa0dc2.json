(He\u2019s the cheaper cousin of Captain Morgan.)\n\nGet ready to re-create this elevated mind-body experience all at once with something called \u201cHard Cold Brew.\u201d Shudder.\n\nBeer company MillerCoors is tapping into the White Claw market, a.k.a. millennials who want to get fucked up but remain fully optimized, and has introduced a La Colombe collaboration cold brew canned coffee with 4.2 percent ABV. Mmmm.\n\nI remember when 4Loko, the quickly banned alcoholic energy drink, caused massive public safety arrests on my campus in Connecticut. I distinctly recall staring dead-eyed at some kid kicking in the railing of the porch at a house party while clutching his can for dear life. Those were the days.\n\nThe Hard Cold Brew forgoes 4Loko\u2019s blatant appeal to chaos for streamlined, pseudo-health, promising Colombian and Brazilian coffee beans \u201croasted to an even medium\u201d and \u201ccold-pressed overnight.\u201d\n\nDrinking is overall bad, probably, but at least it used to be that when you were doing it you were doing it. Hello, here I am, drinking trash! Then, ideally, you would stop. Now brands are hoping we\u2019ll do it while hydrating and getting energized, until our bodies never rest and simply give out from all of these cans of liquid. And our families can drink them at our funerals.\n\nHave a great weekend!!", "description": "MillerCoors and La Colombe have introduced \u201chard cold brew,\u201d combining coffee and alcohol, and what could go wrong?", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/13/la-colombe-hard-cold-brew-b.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
