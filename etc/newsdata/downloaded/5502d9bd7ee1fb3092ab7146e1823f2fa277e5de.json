Illustration: Lauren Tamaki\n\nLower Manhattan\u2019s narrow, twisty streets always seem darker than the rest of the island\u2019s, even in bright daylight, and are positively gloomy on a Saturday night. But halfway along Wall Street, I saw my destination. The little white sign practically jumped out in the dark: Ralph\u2019s Club.\n\nI smiled and then let out a laugh.\n\nThe proprietor of this establishment, Ralph Lauren, was affirming a practice that surely predates the notion of the American Dream \u2014 which is, style yourself in the trappings of power. In the 1840s and 1850s, when Broadway was beginning to explode with luxury emporiums like A.T. Stewart, the very first department store in America, the thing to do was to use granite and marble rather than brick, and in that way imitate centers of money and power \u2014 City Hall, the Bank of America, Grace Church. Stewart, an Irish immigrant, was the first to forge the connection with his \u201cMarble Palace,\u201d a building that still stands near City Hall.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nLauren could have well afforded to locate his Caf\u00e9 Society\u2013style nightclub uptown, but how much richer to use a former Wall Street bank. For just one night, his display staff transformed the place: creamy white walls, a majestic stairway, a gleaming black bar with giant urns of white flowers, two tiers of white banquette seating, faux Art Deco chandeliers and trimmings, and a hip orchestra.\n\nLast season, Lauren created a brasserie in his Madison Avenue flagship, serving his own coffee blend and more, and actually doing something that is rare in the grubby fashion world \u2014 making people feel good, and doing it with some polish and wit.\n\nYou can say it\u2019s all about ego and, well, yes, that would probably be accurate. There\u2019s a chapter of the American story that\u2019s all about achievements driven by ego, and the Bronx-born Lauren has contributed to that as well, from his original concept of Anglo-American classics, to the still-powerful ads he created with Bruce Weber, to his glamorous homes and car collection, to his Gatsby movie costumes, to his own ambitions and private insecurities.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s ego involved, down to the monogrammed little silver buckets of iced crudit\u00e9s on the tables and the napkins.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nOn the other hand, nothing quite approximates the thrill of seeing Janelle Mon\u00e1e, the evening\u2019s entertainment, in a tuxedo vest and ball skirt clamor up on a chair at your table while belting out a song, and then pick up an empty wine glass and shatter it on the linen. As she worked her way around the room, she spontaneously patted the editor Suzy Menkes on her signature pompadour.\n\nIn the last two or three years, as the Lauren company has shifted to the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model, it has fixed early mistakes (mostly to do with the lack of sizzle in the products) and steadily upped its game. The last two shows provided a bonanza of marketing imagery. Most other American fashion brands shrink by comparison.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nAs for the clothes, Lauren kept with a crisp, though relaxed, black-tie story. The strongest bits were the various takes on the tuxedo and a pair of flouncy long skirts with vests (one version in yellow), with the models\u2019 tousled hair adding to the mood. If I had a complaint with the collection, it was the general lack of depth and nuance in the designs. There could have been more details \u2014 in the cut of the clothes, in the variety, in the accessories \u2014 that imparted a taste and knowledge of the world that the club setting implied. In previous collections \u2014 like the brasserie show and his big anniversary bash last year \u2014 Lauren has shown that depth.\n\nAnd he certainly is in a position to do more than a surface treatment.", "description": "Fashion critic Cathy Horyn reviews the spring 2020 Ralph Lauren \n    collection as part of New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Cathy Horyn"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/08/ralph-lauren-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
