The first ten minutes or so of Pence\u2019s speech focused on the Trump administration\u2019s record regarding trade. A bit later, Pence turned to the situation in Hong Kong, saying \u201cHong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty.\u201d He also said, \u201cTo the millions in Hong Kong who have been peacefully demonstrating to protect your rights these past months, we stand with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, China is not only exporting hundreds of billions of dollars in unfairly traded goods to the United States but lately China\u2019s also been trying to export censorship, the hallmark of the regime, by exploiting corporate greed,\u201d Pence said. He added, \u201cFar too many American multi-national corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China\u2019s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party but even affirmative expressions of American values.\n\n\u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door. Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets\u2019 general manager\u2019s seven-word tweet which read, \u2018Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd some of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China. In siding with the Chinese communist party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly-owned subsidiary of that authoritarian regime. A progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive it is regressive. When American corporations, professional sports, pro athletes embrace censorship, it\u2019s not just wrong it\u2019s un-American. American corporations should stand up for American values here at home and around the world.\u201d\n\nNike and the NBA have been playing at woke politics in the public sphere for a while now. They are both happy to claim the mantle of defender of human rights so long as they can market the image to kids who buy sneakers. But when it counts, when there\u2019s no upside in it for them, they quietly side with the censors. I think this is what people on the left would call a teachable moment.\n\nYou can see the full speech below. The section on Hong Kong starts at around 22 minutes.", "description": "\"...it's not just wrong it's un-American.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mike-Pence.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
