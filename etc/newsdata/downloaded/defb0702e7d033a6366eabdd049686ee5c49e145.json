I would certainly vote for her for president over Donald Trump. But as the Democratic primary unfolds and she extends a steady rise in the polls, I keep coming back to a political vulnerability of which many followers of Massachusetts politics are aware but others may not be.\n\nThe problem is that she has a relatively weak standing in Massachusetts with non-college-educated working-class voters, and especially white workers. These voters are critical, especially in the Midwest and in states crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nYou might call it the Warren Paradox. Her core message as a politician \u2014 that America has become rigged in favor of the very wealthy, and the rich get richer as the rest of us get shafted \u2014 is very much aimed at the working class. What\u2019s more, her personal narrative, of her rise from \u201cthe ragged edge of the middle class\u201d in her native Oklahoma, as she has put it, to professional success and acclaim in the fields of education and government might seem to embody a character trait of grit that appeals to blue-collar workers.", "description": "", "authors": ["Paul Starobin", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Elizabeth-Warren-Massachusetts.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
