This was a substantial move from their norm across the board.\n\nAmong Democrats, 79% back impeachment proceedings, up 13 points from 66% last weekend.\n\nAmong Independents, 39% back impeachment proceedings, up 6 points since last weekend.\n\nMost interestingly, the number of independents who didn't have an opinion either way also rose.\n\nThat means that the percentage of independents who opposed impeachment proceedings overall fell 9 points from 45% to 36% over the course of several days.\n\nAmong Republicans, the percentage who favored impeachment doubled from 5% to 10%.\n\nThe poll was of 1,640 registered voters and has a 2 point margin of error.\n\nIt's early, but the polls are all saying similar things\n\nThis poll is particularly interesting because Morning Consult has been dutifully asking this question going on two years. Following the release of the Mueller Report in early May, the numbers regarding impeachment have been flat according to their survey. Support has been between 35% and 38% over the preceding 12 polls Morning Consult conducted from May through September. A 9-percentage point jump \u2014 though it's only from a single poll \u2014 is consequential knowing that context.\n\nOther polls released today regarding impeachment have less of a track record on the question but support the key finding that the events of the past several days have substantially moved the needle. A YouGov poll found 55% of adults supporting impeachment, including an eye-popping percentage of Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released Thursday found 49% of US adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president. That represents a significant jump since a similar question was asked in a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll in May, after the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference, which found just 39% of Americans felt Congress should move to hold impeachment hearings.\n\nEarlier today Insider released a poll conducted on SurveyMonkey Audience that found 53% backed a formal inquiry and further 45% of respondents backed impeachment.\n\nThe details keep on coming\n\nThe rise in support for impeachment among all voters occurred in concert with a series of major developments in Washington linked to a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAmid mounting pressure over the call, which a series of reports in the media had tied to a whistleblower report from a US intelligence official, the White House on Wednesday released a memo on the conversation.\n\nThe memo on the phone call showed Trump repeatedly pressuring Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, confirming media reports from roughly the past week.\n\nOn Thursday, the whistleblower complaint was publicly released, presenting damning charges against Trump in relation to the call.\n\nRead more: A majority of the House now supports some form of impeachment inquiry, reaching the magic number that could be decisive in impeaching Trump\n\n\"In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint said White House officials were \"deeply disturbed\" by the call and worried they'd witnessed Trump \"abuse his office for personal gain.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. The release of the phone call memo and whistleblower complaint have only exacerbated support for some level of an impeachment action among lawmakers \u2014 a majority of House members now support at least holding an impeachment inquiry. Based on the new poll from Morning Consult, it appears that a significant portion of the public is being swept up in this momentum.", "description": "Morning Consult has released an eye-popping new survey that found 43% of voters think congress should begin impeachment proceedings.", "authors": ["Walt Hickey", "John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d28292e22af6b8c6706e5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
