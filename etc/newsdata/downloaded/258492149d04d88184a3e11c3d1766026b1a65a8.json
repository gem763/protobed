Think about that not-so-subtle mention of ADT's home security features in \"Dead to Me,\" or the debate over New Coke in \"Stranger Things.\"\n\n\"Every client that we talk with, every new sales conversation that we have, it is driven by them wanting to talk about partnerships in SVOD \u2014 and more so Netflix than other platforms,\" Stacy Jones, at Hollywood Branded, previously told Business Insider. \"Time and time again, it's Netflix shows that pop up as being the primary water-cooler-moment types of content that brands know about.\"\n\nThere are three main ways advertisers can tie themselves to Netflix shows: product placement, marketing tie-ins, and merchandising.\n\nBrands and agencies work directly with the productions to place products in Netflix shows, similar to other streaming shows.\n\nSome productions make creative choices to write brands into series, like the Duffer Brothers did with Eggo waffles, KFC chicken, and New Coke in \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nOther times, crew members, such as the prop masters, set decorators, and costume designers, will work with brands and their agencies to get laptops, phones, cars, apparel, or other products they can use on screen, like the GMC pick-up trucks in Netflix's \"Queer Eye\" revival.\n\nBrands typically don't pay to be in Netflix shows. But there are many different kinds of Netflix originals, some of which are acquired or coproduced with other studios. Some placements are paid for.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix itself only gets involved with product placement when it comes to clearances \u2014 or securing approvals to use the products in the shows \u2014 or expanding the integrations into a bigger promotional campaigns.\n\nMarketing tie-ins can amplify a product placement or live entirely outside of a show.\n\nMarketing tie-ins are growing way advertisers can work with Netflix shows.\n\nWe saw this most recently around \"Stranger Things,\" when Netflix amplified some of the brands that appeared in the shows with partnerships outside of the platform, such as \"Stranger Things\"-themed Coca-Cola cans and products tied to the integration of New Coke into the series. There were also brand partnerships that lived entirely outside of the show, like Baskin-Robbin's Scoops Ahoy pop-up experience.\n\nNetflix's brand partnership and consumer products teams work with marketers directly on these deals. But there aren't marketing tie-ins to every Netflix show. The team has been focusing on its tentpole shows where brands can be woven naturally into the content.\n\nThe streaming company typically isn't being paid for these deals either, though it does reap the rewards of what its brand partners spend on media to promote the partnerships.\n\nNetflix-branded merchandising is also becoming more popular.\n\nFor Netflix's most popular shows, there may also be merchandising or other licensing opportunities \u2014 be it Nike sneakers for \"Stranger Things\" or Funko toys for shows like \"Big Mouth\" or \"Glow.\"\n\nThese deals are handled in-house by Netflix's consumer products team, which is led by former Disney exec Christie Fleischer, who also oversees brand partnerships and partner marketing at the streaming giant.\n\nNetflix typically gets a cut of the sales from the products, or licensing fees.", "description": "Netflix works with brands on product placement, marketing tie-ins, or licensing deals tied to some of its shows.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d68222a2e22af24d468fb6b-2732-1366.jpg"}
