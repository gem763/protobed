At 12%, the aggregate allocation to cash is only in the fifth percentile of the past 30 years, they calculated.\n\n\u201cHigh uncertainty, investor fears of a recession, and low starting cash allocations will likely limit a significant increase in equity allocations\u201d in 2020, the Goldman team wrote in an Oct. 25 note.\n\nJust like this year, corporate demand will be the top source of U.S. equity buying in 2020, Goldman projected. While buybacks may drop, net demand is still seen as strong thanks to diminished initial public offerings and a rise in cash-based mergers and acquisitions. Households and foreign investors will also be net buyers, while pension funds keep whittling down their allocation, as they have since 2009, Goldman said.\n\nAmong the bank\u2019s 2020 forecasts:\n\nNet corporate purchases for U.S. equities will total $470 billion in 2020, down 2% from this yearForeign investors will buy a net $50 billionHouseholds will add a net $30 billionPurchases by exchange-traded funds will be a net $150 billion, less than the five-year average of $220 billion\n\nAmerican stock funds have seen $100 billion of outflows so far in 2019, on pace for the second-largest drawdown in 15 years, with actively managed mutual funds seeing a $217 billion exodus, according to data compiled by Goldman. Bonds have enjoyed a $353 billion inflow, while cash has seen a $436 billion influx, the Goldman analysis showed.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Anstey in Tokyo at canstey@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Cecile Vannucci\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The outflow from U.S. equity funds this year has been the biggest since 2008, relative to the flood of money into cash and bonds, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.That still leaves cash exposures \u201cnear historical lows,\u201d according to Goldman strategists led by David Kostin.
