Some members of that now-shuttered team have now joined other teams at the firm. Citadel manages a total of $32 billion.\n\nSources say the team did perform well during the recent oil spike, when the price of crude jumped nearly 20% and hit many hedge funds that had made bearish bets on the commodity.\n\nThe precise nature of the two individuals' trading violations in their personal accounts could not be determined, and the firm declined to comment when asked about details of the infractions.\n\nJarrad Bourger, the portfolio manager for the group, was fired for performance reasons, the same source told Business Insider, but was not involved with the compliance violations.\n\n\"Citadel has always had a strong, robust culture of compliance, and we expect all of our employees to act with the highest levels of integrity,\" a spokesperson for the hedge fund said in a statement.\n\nSee more: Ken Griffin's Citadel is losing a longtime money-manager and the COO of its Global Equities business\n\nWhen Citadel sent out an email to employees about the liquidation of the portfolio and the dismissal of a majority of the team, an email from the compliance department followed shortly after, sources tell Business Insider. The email from compliance was a reminder of rules around trading in personal accounts.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn, Lingsch has been with Citadel for almost two years, previously working as an analyst for Arete Investment Group in Austin, Texas, for more than four years. Allums has been with Citadel for less than a year, working previously for Point72 as a research analyst on the healthcare team and as a vice president with the venture capital arm of Steve Cohen's firm. Both did not respond to requests for comment. Bourger could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe firm's flagship fund, Wellington, is up 14.2% for the year through the end of August, besting many of the firm's multi-strategy peers. The average hedge fund, according to Hedge Fund Research, is up 7.8% through the first eight months of year.\n\nSee more: Humans are beating machines, and Pershing Square and Greenlight are crushing it.
