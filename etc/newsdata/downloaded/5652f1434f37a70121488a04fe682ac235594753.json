In total, 53 percent of consumers said that existing data protection controls will influence whether or not they will work with a company, and 64 percent have chosen not to work with a business due to poor cybersecurity measures.\n\nNo matter how great their products or services, 83 percent of consumers say they would stop working with a firm if they discovered their information has been shared without their consent.\n\nAccording to the research, it is not just a matter of how consumer data is protected -- customers also expect businesses to maintain clear guidelines on how information belonging to them is used.\n\nCNET: The best home security cameras of 2019\n\nIn total, 60 percent of consumers said that organizations play a \"great deal\" of a role in creating clear, understandable guidelines, more so than the same expectations of the government, third-parties, or watchdog groups.\n\nThe lack of existing tools, perhaps beyond legislation such as the UK's Freedom of Information Act, is contributing to the feeling that consumers have lost control of their data. According to IBM, if there was some way for customers to revoke and take back their information at whim, 76 percent of consumers would be more willing to share their personal data in the first place.\n\nIn addition, 68 percent of those surveyed said they would be happy to share more should businesses demonstrate that they are capable of monitoring and controlling how their data is being used.\n\nTechRepublic: More than 99% of attacks in the past year relied on human error to gain access\n\nBusinesses should take note of the results of this survey. The EU is already enforcing stricter standards with the handling and use of consumer data through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it may be that the same pressure will result in similar legislation across the pond.\n\nIf we have reached a stage where consumers place more emphasis on data protection than products, enterprise companies need to satisfy these demands to ensure their own long-term success and future customer retention.\n\nIn related news, IBM launched the z15 mainframe this week. The z15, the successor to 2017's IBM Z, has been designed for organizations seeking a way to manage customer relations and input.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
