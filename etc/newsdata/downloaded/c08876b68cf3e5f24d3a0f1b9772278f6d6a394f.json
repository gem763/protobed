Here's what you need to know as you start your Thursday ...\n\nWhistleblower lawyers acknowledge client had 'contact' with presidential candidates\n\nThe attorneys representing the whistleblower at the center of Democrats' impeachment inquiry acknowledged in a statement Wednesday that their client \"has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties\" -- but insisted the contact involved the politicians' roles as \"elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\" Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj asserted in their statement that the whistleblower \"has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign or party\" -- leaving open the possibility that the whistleblower advised a current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate prior to their run for office.\n\nThe lawyers' disclosure came shortly after the Washington Examiner reported that Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson told lawmakers the whistleblower worked \u201cor had some type of professional relationship\u201d with one of the Democratic presidential candidates, citing three sources familiar with Atkinson\u2019s interview with lawmakers on Friday.

Trump also said Republicans must get a \"fair shake.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden for the first time called for the impeachment of President Trump over the Ukrainian controversy. According to a new Fox News poll released Wednesday, just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether.\n\nAnd in an interview on \"Hannity,\" Trump's son Eric noted that former President Barack Obama has been conspicuously silent regarding the link between Ukraine and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. \"He's the only guy who's hiding,\" Eric Trump said of Obama. \"I mean, Joe Biden was his vice president. Where is Obama? What does he think about this rampant corruption?\"\n\nTurkey says ground forces advancing in Syria, at least seven civilians among the first deaths reported\n\nTurkish ground forces pressed their advance against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Thursday, Turkey's Defense Ministry said, launching airstrikes and unleashing artillery shelling on Syrian towns and villages the length of its border.. The latest development comes as at least seven civilians and three members of the Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces were among the first reported deaths Wednesday after Turkey announced that its ground forces invaded northeastern Syria to fight against Kurdish forces.\n\nThe ground offensive was part of a wave of initial attacks in the region after President Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw American troops from the area. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the mission was to \"neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes.\" After Erdogan announced the offensive, Trump called the operation \"a bad idea.\" Later Wednesday, he said he didn't want to be involved in \"endless, senseless wars.\"\n\nThe president told reporters Wednesday that he would do \"far more than sanctions\" against Turkey if the country didn't act in the most \"humane way as possible,\" and that he hoped Erdogan would act rationally. When asked what would happen if Erdogan wiped out the Kurds, Trump threatened to \"wipe out\" Turkey's economy, saying he'd done it once before.
