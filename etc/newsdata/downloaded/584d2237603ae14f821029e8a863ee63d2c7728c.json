Schumer, though, pushed back, telling reporters the disagreement is over more money Republicans have demanded to build the president\u2019s wall along the southern border.\n\n\u201cI heard Leader McConnell say poison pills are the reason \u2026 that\u2019s not the reason,\u201d the New York Democrat said. \u201cTheir proposal, which didn\u2019t work out\u2026 puts $12 billion more for the wall. That is not going to happen, we know that. That\u2019s what\u2019s causing all their problems.\u201d\n\nWhen the Senate returned after their month long recess, Mr. McConnell said the chamber\u2019s focus will be on finalizing appropriation bills. Democrats demanded debate on gun control legislation.\n\n\u201cA major focus of the Senate this month will be moving forward as many of the regular appropriation bills as possible and then passing a temporary continuing resolution for the outstanding parts of the government before the end of September,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Monday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
