That wasn\u2019t shocking at all, and now we\u2019re even less surprised to read a report from the Washington Examiner that that candidate is none other than Joe Biden.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic candidate with whom the CIA whistleblower had a \"professional\" tie is @JoeBiden, according to intelligence officers and former @WhiteHouse officials. https://t.co/kELmnhhiL2 \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 10, 2019\n\nRob Crilly, Steven Nelson, and David M. Drucker report:\n\nThe 2020 Democratic candidate with whom the CIA whistleblower had a \u201cprofessional\u201d tie is Joe Biden, according to intelligence officers and former White House officials. Lawyers for the whistleblower said he had worked only \u201cin the executive branch.\u201d The Washington Examiner has established that he is a career CIA analyst who was detailed to the National Security Council at the White House and has since left. On Sept. 26, the New York Times reported that he was a CIA officer. On Oct. 4, the newspaper added that he \u201cwas detailed to the National Security Council at one point.\u201d \u2026 A retired CIA officer told the Washington Examiner, \u201cFrom everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch then, there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president.\u201d\n\nNo way. Could this be why the whistleblower\u2019s source was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d after hearing the call?\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING \ud83d\udea8 Joe Biden worked with Whistleblower when he was Vice President Is anyone really surprised?\n\nhttps://t.co/sI0tj8VMSn \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 10, 2019\n\nI knew it had to be Biden connected.
