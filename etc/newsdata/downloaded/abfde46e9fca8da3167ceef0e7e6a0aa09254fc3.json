Six other counties could see precautionary outages if \u201cred flag\u201d fire danger warnings expand, the utility warned.\n\nRed flag warnings were in effect north and east of San Francisco, where wind gusts were expected to reach 50 mph, the National Weather Service reported Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters in Southern California were predicting brief bursts of hot Santa Ana winds east and west of Los Angeles. Nearly 90,000 electricity customers of Southern California Edison were advised that their areas could be subjected to precautionary outages.\n\n\u201cThis is our first event of the year. It is expected to be short-lived and we are ready,\u201d said Brian Humphrey, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nConcerns about wildfires are mounting in the wake of November\u2019s Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills, killing 86 people and leveling nearly 15,000 homes. Many of those killed were elderly or disabled; the oldest was 99 years old.\n\nAn investigation by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection found that sparks from PG&E\u2019s transmission lines had started the blaze.\n\nAccording to data released by the state in July, the community has lost more than 90% of its population since the fire.\n\n\u201cThe town is still pretty empty,\u201d a clerk at the Paradise Dollar Tree told The Washington Times. \u201cPeople are worried because it is fire season again.\u201d\n\nParadise\u2019s Taco Bell reopened just last week \u2014 the community\u2019s only fast food restaurant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here and we\u2019re trying to help people get back on their feet,\u201d manager Jim Voden told The Times. \u201cThe fire was just awful. The town is still pretty much gone. But we are trying.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s three leading utilities began using preemptive outages to reduce wildfire risks earlier this decade. San Diego Gas & Electric started in 2013, Southern California Edison in 2017, with PG&E following later, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Paradise Fire has caused major financial trouble for PG&E. The utility had plans to shut off power ahead of the fire but canceled the move after receiving complaints and demands for reimbursement for a preemptive outage it carried out the month before that affected 87,000 customers.\n\nIn January, the utility sought bankruptcy protection, saying it could not afford an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits stemming from wildfires. Earlier this month, it agreed to pay $11 billion to insurance companies holding 85% of the claims from fires that include the Paradise blaze.\n\nLeading California climatologists maintain that climate change is fueling the trend of hotter summers and warmer, drier autumns and thereby creating the tinderbox-like conditions that cause devastating blazes.\n\nDaniel Swain, a researcher for the Center for Climate Science at the University of California-Los Angeles, tweeted that the Paradise Fire would not have occurred \u201cif Northern California had received anywhere near the typical amount of autumn precipitation.\u201d\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
