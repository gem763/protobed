A win without a bonus point, or even if they pick up a bonus point in defeat, would also send the Irish through if Japan's game is called off.\n\nItaly could have qualified for the quarter-finals with a shock win over double defending champions New Zealand and coach Conor O\u00b4Shea said everyone around the camp was feeling down after the cancellation condemned them to third place.\n\n\"I'm finding it really difficult and I saw the players' reaction after training and it was horrible because these guys have given their lives to Italian rugby and their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field,\" he said.\n\nNew Zealand finish top of the group with South Africa going through as runners up.\n\nWhile England and France were already assured of a spot in the quarter-finals the cancellation means Eddie Jones's side finish top of the group.\n\n\"All we can think about now is preparing for the quarter-final and I think we will have an exceptional two weeks of preparation,\" said Jones, who had been warning about the risk of disruption from typhoons almost since he took over as England coach. Thursday's decision marks the first time a World Cup match has been cancelled since the tournament started in 1987.\n\nThe 1995 semi-final between hosts South Africa and France was delayed by an hour due to a waterlogged pitch, but famously went ahead after a team of cleaning ladies took to it with brooms.\n\n(Additional reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "description": "By Mitch PhillipsTOKYO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Rugby World Cup organisers were forced to call off matches for the first time in the tournament's 32-year history...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
