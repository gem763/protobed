Previously the bank had not shifted the rate in almost three years.\n\nReserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe has said he wants to use rate cuts to get the economy growing fast enough to push the unemployment rate down to 4.5%. The jobless rate now is 5.3%.\n\nThe Australian economy is suffering from the end of a mining boom, largely to supply China, that carried the country through the global economic crisis without a recession.", "description": "The cut on Tuesday follows reductions by the Reserve Bank of Australia in June and July.
