Roosevelt said he wanted to bring the six Marines pictured to Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we kind of opened up this Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d Spence told The Washington Post.\n\nIt would take nearly 75 years to get the names right.\n\nAD\n\nThis month, the Marine Corps confirmed that it had long misidentified one of the men in Rosenthal\u2019s iconic picture from the island of Iwo Jima, after Spence and other historians submitted a PowerPoint of evidence. It wasn\u2019t the first error. Three years ago, the Marines acknowledged another mistake, and false IDs have plagued a second image from the Feb. 23, 1945, flag-raising on Japan\u2019s Mount Suribachi, too.\n\nAD\n\nBoth the Marines and the FBI\u2019s Digital Evidence Laboratory worked to confirm the latest \u201copportunity to expand on the historical record,\u201d the Marine Corps told NBC News in a statement \u2014 the revelation that Cpl. Harold \u201cPie\u201d Keller rather than Pfc. Rene Gagnon is pictured in Rosenthal\u2019s shot.\n\n\u201cRegardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps\u2019 cherished history,\u201d the Marines said. \u201cIn the words of General David H. Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, \u2018they are all heroes.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Marines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor Spence, the Marines\u2019 admission capped a personal project that\u2019s spanned half the 35-year-old\u2019s life. Fascinated by World War II after growing up on his grandfather\u2019s stories of piloting in the Pacific, Spence spent his college years interviewing veterans. One of those veterans told him a story about a flag-raising picture from Iwo Jima that all the books got wrong.\n\nAD\n\nTwo flag-raisings were memorialized on Iwo Jima on Feb. 23; U.S. forces swapped in a bigger flag before Rosenthal\u2019s shot. Spence started scouting out misconceptions about the first, lesser-known photo before moving on to the Rosenthal image that plastered newspapers back in 1945. He teamed up with two other historians who had been scrutinizing the pictures, Stephen Foley and Brent Westemeyer.\n\nAD\n\nIn May 2016, the Marine Corps announced it was revisiting the lore around the famous Associated Press photo, thanks to Spence and others\u2019 digging. Within a month, a panel headed by a retired general had put its weight behind the historians\u2019 findings.\n\nNavy Pharmacist\u2019s Mate 2nd Class John Bradley was, in fact, Marine Pvt. Harold Schultz. Bradley was actually part of the first, smaller flag-raising, the panel affirmed.\n\nAD\n\nWestemeyer had a \u201chunch\u201d that one man was still wrongly identified, Spence recalled. But they needed proof.\n\nThose lingering questions sent Spence to Army archives in Carlisle, Pa., where he sifted through other, little-known pictures from that day on Iwo Jima \u2014 snapped by photographers who never got Rosenthal\u2019s fame. It was like a puzzle, he said: He would match a snippet of camouflage helmet from Rosenthal\u2019s image to different picture, then trace another detail to yet another picture, until he found a clearly visible face.\n\nAD\n\nThe face he landed on seemed to belong to Harold Keller. Looking for more confirmation, Spence said, he tracked down Keller\u2019s daughter, Kay Maurer.\n\nMaurer showed him a trunk of keepsakes her parents saved from the war era, full of news clippings using words like \u201cbloodbath\u201d and \u201cmeat-grinder\u201d to describe the brutal war being waged in the Pacific, Spence said. Among the papers: articles about the flag-raising.\n\nAD\n\nSpence has spoken with many veterans over the years, he said, but Keller stood out: A Purple Heart winner and Marine Raider, Keller was what Spence calls \u201cthe Navy SEAL of World War II,\u201d a man highly trained and prepared to survive behind enemy lines. Keller found out that he\u2019d fought in major clashes like the Battle of Midway and lived through a bullet in the neck.\n\nAD\n\nThe only one of the six Marines in Rosenthal\u2019s photo to have children, Keller would name his son after a friend mortally wounded at the bottom of Mount Suribachi, Spence said.\n\nNews that Keller was pictured in the famous photo has reportedly caught Keller\u2019s family off guard.\n\n\u201cHe never spoke about any of this when we were growing up,\u201d 70-year-old daughter Maurer told NBC News. \u201cWe knew he fought in the war, we knew he was wounded in the shoulder at one point. \u2026 But he didn\u2019t tell us he helped raise the flag on Mount Suribachi.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHanging on the living room wall, though, was another Rosenthal picture, Maurer told the news station. It showed Marines in front of a flag.\n\nAD\n\nAn obituary indicates that Keller died in 1979.\n\nSometimes, Spence said, he\u2019s asked why it matters who\u2019s in Rosenthal\u2019s image. After all, the second flag-raising shot seems composed to discourage identification.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be named individuals,\u201d Spence speculated. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to see Marines, or any type of person, coming together to raise something, raise a flag that symbolizes unity.\u201d\n\nBut Spence says the moments captured on Feb. 23, 1945, matter a great deal to the veterans he\u2019s encountered over years of sleuthing. Obituaries identify men as \u201cIwo Jim flag-raisers.\u201d One of Spence\u2019s documentaries captures a veteran\u2019s habit \u2014 years after participating atop Mount Suribachi \u2014 of putting a flag up each day outside his house.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the Rosenthal photo\u2019s track record, Spence believes the Marines finally have the right names.\n\n\u201cI feel the journey is over,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAD", "description": "The famous shot from Iwo Jima won a Pulitzer, signaled triumph amid massive causalities and helped finance the war.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BXHmth2tkJfdgQW_HYlz12KYdlA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N2K7T5XQPII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
