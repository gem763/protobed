Thinks A 'Lot Has Been Said' About Joker, So It's Cancelling Red Carpet Interviews", "language": "en", "text": "Someone in Gotham expressing their solidarity with the Joker. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nWhile the larger conversation around Todd Phillips\u2019 upcoming Joker film continues to intensify as people reflect on how the story\u2019s depiction of a white domestic terrorist fits into our cultural landscape, Warner Bros. is attempting to take back some control of the narrative by barring print and broadcast press access to the red carpet of the Hollywood premiere where interviews were to be conducted.\n\nVariety reports that Warner Bros. has disinvited all print and television reporters from the red carpet of Joker\u2019s Hollywood premiere, set to take place this Saturday in the US, and only photographers will be granted access. (We have independently confirmed that only photographic press will be allowed on the red carpet.)\n\nVariety\u2019s Editor in Chief Claudia Eller reacted to the news by writing, \u201cAre you kidding me?? Is this unprecedented???\u201d\n\nWhile red carpet interviews don\u2019t always lead to the lengthiest of exchanges between reporters, cast and crew members, they\u2019re still excellent opportunities for members of the press to present the rich and powerful with succinct, to-the-point questions worth asking.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Warner Bros. spokesperson did not give us a reason for the press being barred \u2014 which is highly unusual, if not unprecedented \u2014 but gave the following statement: \u201cA lot has been said about Joker, and we just feel it\u2019s time for people to see the film.\u201d\n\nJoaquin Phoenix Couldn't Answer The Most Obvious Question About Joker's Subject Matter Because Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker tells the relatively grounded story of a disaffected white man who goes on a terroristic rampage because he feels as if he\u2019s been dealt a bad hand in life, there\u2019s been an ongoing discussion about whether the movie has the potential to inspire certain viewers to model themselves (idealistically) after the titular villain. Read more\n\nA lot of interviews regarding Joker have already been conducted before this past week, of course (we spoke to the director earlier this year). It wasn\u2019t until an interview posted by The Telegraph \u2014 in which the outlet reported Phoenix walking out after being asked whether audiences might take the wrong message away from the film \u2014 that things started getting really contentious.\n\nFamily members of those killed in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, mass shooting put out a statement this week, not to condemn or boycott the film, but to ask Warner Bros. to \u201cend political contributions to candidates who take money from the NRA and vote against gun reform\u201d and \u201cuse [its] political clout and leverage in Congress to actively lobby for gun reform\u201d.\n\nEven if the studio never intended for the movie to become such a lightning rod that the military saw fit to warn its service members about it, the fact that it has isn\u2019t wholly surprising to anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to the film\u2019s development (to say nothing of the darker parts of the Joker fandom.)\n\nAfter these stories came out, Phillips himself started defending the film in several interviews, calling outrage a \u201ccommodity\u201d. He spoke to The Wrap:\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make the movie to push buttons,\u201d Phillips told TheWrap\u2019s Sharon Waxman in an interview last Friday about the filmmaking process. \u201cI literally described to Joaquin at one point in those three months as like, \u2018Look at this as a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film\u2019. It wasn\u2019t, \u2018We want to glorify this behaviour.\u2019 It was literally like \u2018Let\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and we\u2019ll call it f\u2013ing Joker\u2019. That\u2019s what it was. \u201c\n\nMany outlets, us included, discuss real-world issues touched on in the movies we cover, comic book or otherwise. It isn\u2019t often studios are eager to participate in those more serious conversations with us, but thankfully that\u2019s beginning to change (albeit slowly).\n\nMovies such as Joker, though, feel antithetical to fostering those kinds of important conversations, which is why Warner Bros.\u2019 decision is so questionable.\n\nWarner Bros. suddenly deciding to bar reporters from the movie\u2019s red carpet doesn\u2019t send the message that the studio is actually interested in giving its director and cast a chance to unpack Joker\u2019s big ideas, and Phillips own dialogue doesn\u2019t either.\n\nIt suggests the studio might never have fully understood the full gravity of moving forward with the movie \u2014 or that once the studio realised it was going to have to answer difficult questions about the end product, it chose to simply cut the press\u2019 access off altogether.\n\nWriters Guild of America East members were previously invited to a Joker screening, to be held next week, followed by a Q&A session with Phillips and Joker\u2019s co-writer Scott Silver. (G/O Media\u2019s editorial staff are members and therefore included, but the WGAE is not primarily made up of press media.)\n\nWe have confirmed the screening is still taking place but have yet to confirm if the Q&A has been cancelled. If so, it would mark a rather alarming precedent.\n\nU.S. Military Issues Warning To Troops About Incel Violence At Joker Screenings [Updated] The U.S. military has warned U.S. service members about the potential for a mass shooter at screenings of the Warner Bros. film Joker, which has sparked wide concerns from, among others, the families of those killed during the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Read more\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has stated that it has no reason to believe that the movie\u2019s release will coincide with any attacks on cinemas, but it\u2019s hard not to understand why the idea of a shooting at a Joker screening worries people.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that the movie itself features a character who is defined by the kind of unhinged madness that leads people to storm movie cinemas with automatic weapons, it\u2019s that shootings in public spaces are a terrifying aspect of American society that the studio knows everyone\u2019s thinking about more than ever in 2019.\n\nAs Phillips said to The Wrap about the controversy: \u201cI\u2019m surprised\u2026 Isn\u2019t it good to have these discussions? Isn\u2019t it good to have these discussions about these movies, about violence? Why is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it?\u201d\n\nIt just seems as if he and WB don\u2019t actually want to discuss them after all.", "description": "While the larger conversation around Todd Phillips\u2019 upcoming Joker film continues to intensify as people reflect on how the story\u2019s depiction of a white domestic terrorist fits into our cultural landscape, Warner Bros. is attempting to take back some control of the narrative by barring print and broadcast press...", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Gordon Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/sapqo9o5c10gyewaopjg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
