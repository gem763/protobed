The way our fathers, grandfathers etc have for thousands of years,' another wrote.\n\nMr Johncock's brother Matthew also jumped to his defence elsewhere in the Facebook comment thread.\n\nSA Police confirmed on Wednesday that Mr Johncock had not been placed on leave and was working as normal during the investigation\n\nWaylon Johncock, a South Australian police community liaison officer, is under investigation over the disturbing footage shot on Eyre Peninsula\n\nHowever, others said that although Mr Johncock hunted the animal for food, he inflicted unnecessary suffering and laughed at its pain.\n\n'I think the way in which the wombat was killed is the issue. As an Aboriginal myself I was always taught by my elders when hunting to make sure the prey does not suffer in any unnecessary agony and to make the kill quick and clean,' one wrote.\n\n'The way he killed that wombat will make a mockery of our traditional rights to hunt and gather traditional native food.'\n\nAnother added: 'Traditional hunting does not need to be taken away, but a clean kill should always be the aim as should the consumption of the animal if that was the intent of the kill.'\n\nThe Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation, covering the area where Mr Johncock lives and works out of the Yalata police station, supported him as soon as the video emerged.\n\n'Under Aboriginal customary law, a person is entitled to hunt for food. If someone is not hunting for food and merely kills an animal for gratification, that is not acceptable under Aboriginal law,' it said.\n\n'We are aware that the Aboriginal man in the video shared that animal with his family and it was eaten.\n\n'Wombat is a much sought after traditional food on the Far West Coast.'\n\nDisturbing footage has emerged of an off-duty police officer stoning a terrified wombat to death and laughing about it\n\nThe off-duty police officer can be seen turning around and giving his friend a thumbs up before throwing the rock at the wombat's head\n\nThe corporation said traditional food was shown to be better for Aboriginals than Western food.\n\nUnder the Native Title Act of 1993, Aboriginal people are allowed to maintain ancient customs such as hunting local wildlife.\n\nThe former SANFL player was widely condemned online and 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for him to be punished.\n\nHowever, SA Police confirmed that Mr Johncock had not been placed on leave and was working as normal during the investigation.\n\nSA Police's social media pages were in the past day bombarded with dozens of comments demanding an update on the investigation.\n\n'The entire world is watching and waiting for justice to prevail. Nothing short of sacking and charging this individual will be accepted,' one wrote.\n\n'We are waiting... we were promised an answer early this week,' another wrote.\n\n'We all know that if this was one of us and not one of you he would've been dealt with by now.'\n\nThe video was taken on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, showing the off-duty officer repeatedly throwing rocks at the wombat's head while being encouraged by a friend\n\nCommissioner Grant Stevens on October 2 promised the investigation would be dealt with as a matter of urgency and with the 'utmost seriousness' and an update would be released early this week.\n\n'I find the actions portrayed in the footage to be totally abhorrent and unacceptable. I am aware of the community outrage regarding this matter,' he said.\n\n'I want to reassure everybody that the actions in the video do not align with the values and behaviours I expect from my employees, nor does it align with community standards.\n\n'Numerous employees of South Australia Police have also expressed to me that they, too, find the footage detestable and not consistent with their values.'\n\nIndigenous people in South Australia have traditionally killed wombats with rocks and Wirangu-Kokatha elder Jack Johncock said that this right must be preserved.\n\nHowever, Ngarrindjeri elder Major Sumner said the officer's actions in stoning the gentle animal while laughing hysterically were 'wrong'.\n\n'We didn't hunt like that. We still don't hunt like that,' the 71-year-old told The Advertiser.\n\n'If they're saying it was hunting for food, you wouldn't go and hunt a sheep like that (and) you wouldn't go and hunt any cattle like that.\n\n'If you want to hunt something for food, it's done in the most humane way and end their life straight away \u2013 it's not a fun game for you.'\n\nThe disturbing footage showed Mr Johncock repeatedly throwing rocks at the wombat's head on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula.\n\nMr Johncock, who was off-duty at the time, was seen getting out of a truck and chasing after the helpless wombat wearing nothing but his shoes and shorts.\n\nNgarrindjeri elder Major Sumner (pictured) said the officer's shocking cruel actions in stoning the gentle animal was 'wrong'\n\nMr Johncock has been in the South Australian Police Force for 10 years working as one of the state's 36 Community Liaison Officers\n\nThe man behind the wheel told him to 'get up close' as he picked up a rock and hurled it at the animal as it tried to run away.\n\n'You've got him, you've got him, hit him, hit him,' the man in the car could be heard saying as Johncock picked up another rock.\n\n'Kill him!'\n\nAs the man behind the wheel sped up to keep the headlights shining on him, Johncock gave a final blow causing it to topple over.\n\n'Yeah! You did it!' the man in the car said. 'First man I've ever seen kill a wombat on foot, bro.'\n\nMr Johncock has been in the South Australian Police Force for 10 years working as one of the state's 36 Community Liaison Officers.\n\nHis time in the force has been spent helping non-Indigenous officers understand cultural and social issues within the community in order to bridge the gap.\n\nMr Johnock briefly played in the SANFL for Glenelg, but was a star player in country leagues around South Australia.\n\nHe won the league best and fairest awards in the Port Lincoln league in 2005 and the Far Western Football League in 2008, and kicked the winning goal after the siren in a grand final for Noarlunga in the Southern Football League in 2014.", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC  CONTENT - Friends of Waylon Johncock, a South Australian cop, claim that because he and his family ate the wombat he was within his traditional rights to stone it to death.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/06/19646556-0-image-a-18_1570945029800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
