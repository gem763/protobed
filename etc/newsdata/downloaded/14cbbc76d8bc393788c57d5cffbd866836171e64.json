ENB recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with NextDecade Corporation NEXT to build the Rio Bravo natural gas pipeline and several other gas pipelines in South Texas. The pipelines are expected to support NextDecade\u2019s proposed Rio Grande LNG export terminal in Brownsville, TX.\n\nThe 135.5-mile proposed Rio Bravo pipeline, which is part of a $20-billion project, is expected to have a transportation capacity of 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. It will deliver natural gas from the Agua Dulce hub near Corpus Christi to the proposed Rio Grande LNG terminal, which is currently facing some challenges from localites and yet to receive federal permissions.\n\nOn completion of construction, the pipeline will transport natural gas from the Eagle Ford Shale and prolific Permian Basin, where natural gas production is on the rise. In the Permian, natural gas is produced as a by-product of crude oil. As oil production in the basin is projected to increase in the coming years, natural gas output will likely surge proportionately. Markedly, the MOU is expected to be finalized in fourth-quarter 2019.\n\nThe new pipelines to be built with NextDecade will enable Enbridge to earn more stable fee-based revenues under long-term contracts. Notably, Enbridge placed two key projects online in 2019 and is planning to bring several major projects online through 2019 to 2022. Overall, C$19 billion worth of low-risk new projects are likely to fetch the company more profits and raise the value of its shareholders in the coming years. It is well positioned to capitalize on the growing need for natural gas in North America, courtesy of the rapidly expanding business.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nCalgary, Canada-based Enbridge has gained 13.2% year to date compared with 11.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Enbridge carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
