Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to stand, or even fight for, what I believe in,\u201d Buttigieg told USA TODAY. \u201cBut when you hear the word 'fight\u2019 so many times, it starts sounding like fighting is the point. That\u2019s where I think we\u2019re at risk of losing our way.\u201d\n\nMayor of South Bend, Indiana and candidate for president Pete Buttigieg campaigns at Sparks High School on Sept. 28, 2019. More\n\nBig hurdle\n\nButtigieg still faces a big hurdle in convincing people that he can go from being in charge of a city of about 100,000 to leader of the most powerful country in the world \u2013 something that\u2019s never been done.\n\n\u201cIt would be epically stunning,\u201d said Mark Jones of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research. \"Just as Donald Trump's election was epically stunning as well.\"\n\nButtigieg is the first presidential candidate to boast about having the \u201csmartest sewers in the world,\u201d an innovation he's become known for but not a topic usually associated with the commander in chief.\n\nAnd South Bend still has plenty of problems \u2013 including higher-than-average poverty rates, lower-than-average median income, racial disparities and an increase in violent crimes \u2013 that Buttigieg acknowledges haven\u2019t been solved.\n\nAsked at the first Democratic debate why his police department was disproportionately white, he candidly responded: \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d\n\nBut Buttigieg has stood out among his peers, even though when he took office in 2012, he was the nation\u2019s youngest mayor of a city South Bend\u2019s size or larger.\n\nAt the White House launch of MetroLab, South Bend was dwarfed in size by the much larger participating communities \u2013 Chicago, Dallas and New York City.\n\nHe\u2019s outlasted New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in the presidential race and been endorsed by dozens of mayors from across the country who called him their role model.\n\nOfficials from private entities which chose South Bend \u2013 because of Buttigieg \u2013 as a place to pilot new initiatives, said he created a culture of innovation and was a \u201cwonderful talent attractor.\u201d\n\nMark Muro, policy director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program, said the 37-year-old mayor has not only been \u201cat the forefront of younger, more data-oriented, tech-oriented mayors,\u201d but is also noteworthy for how he connects the technical to the human element and conveys big ideas.", "description": "Pete Buttigieg says the \"beta city\" approach he took in South Bend shows why he'd take a different approach to the White House compared with the top contenders.", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wp6IMnvte6pgUa7Kik1NgA--~B/aD0yNjgyO3c9NDAzOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/03005d4349f21ed58e96290226464ef5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
