However, Lizzo\u2019s trademark application, filed in June, is causing some controversy. You see, in February 2017 a British singer who goes by the name Mina Lioness tweeted: \u201cI did a DNA test and found out I\u2019m 100% that bitch.\u201d It went viral.\n\nSeven months later Lizzo released Truth Hurts, which features the same memorable line. (If you\u2019re wondering why the song only became so popular recently, it\u2019s because it was featured on the Netflix romcom Someone Great, which came out in April.)\n\nSo did she steal Mina Lioness\u2019s tweet? Not according to Lizzo. When confronted about the meme in early 2018, the singer tweeted: \u201cIve never seen this before in my life\u2026But u know\u2026The odds of multiple people having the same idea are VERY high.\u201d\n\nShortly after that, however, Lizzo tweeted Mina Lioness and explained:\n\n|L I Z Z O| (@lizzo) Truth Hurts was written in June fyi\u2014 someone made a meme on IG that said \u201cI\u2019m 100% that bitch\u201d and we were inspired, I give that meme credit when I talk about making the song. I\u2019ve never seen ur viral tweet but I\u2019m glad it exists.\n\nThe 2018 back-and-forth didn\u2019t get much attention. However, the controversy flared back up again last week after Mina Lioness discovered that Lizzo, now a mega-star, had filed a trademark application. \u201cWhat I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence,\u201d Mina Lioness tweeted on Saturday. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I\u2019m just the poor Black girl from London that don\u2019t have a dog in the fight.\u201d\n\nTrademark law on fleek\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: even if Lizzo did take Mina Lioness\u2019s tweet, it doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to intellectual property (IP) law. Simply tweeting a phrase doesn\u2019t grant you any legal rights.\n\nDeborah Peckham, an IP specialist at Boston-based law firm Burns & Levinson, notes that if Mina Lioness had commercialized her tweet by, for example, printing it on T-shirts, or using it as a tagline for services, then she might have grounds to contest Lizzo\u2019s trademark application. However, \u201cmerely saying a short phrase or word in public doesn\u2019t give you a legal monopoly over it\u201d.\n\nEyebrows on fleek: the original Vine by Peaches Monroee. Photograph: Vine/Peaches Monroee\n\nMina Lioness isn\u2019t the only person to have found this out the hard way. Speaking over the phone, Matt Schimkowitz, senior editor at Know Your Meme (the Wikipedia of memes) notes that \u201cPeaches Monroee has claimed for years now that she got unfairly treated in the \u2018on fleek\u2019 trend, when people were putting it on T-shirts without crediting her.\u201d\n\nTo refresh your memory: Monroee, whose real name is Kayla Newman, popularized the phrase \u2018\u201con fleek\u201d in 2014 when the teenager uploaded a Vine of herself saying \u201ceyebrows on fleek\u201d. The short video got over 20m views in five months and it wasn\u2019t long before brands had appropriated it for marketing tweets, like Ihop\u2019s \u201cpancakes on fleek\u201d tweet.\n\nNicki Minaj also used the phrase in her hit song Feeling Myself, and took credit for introducing it to the world. Minaj even called out singer Christina Milian for printing \u201cOn Fleek\u201d on T-shirts, joking that she was waiting for her percentage of the royalties. It seems like the only person who didn\u2019t monetize the meme was the young black woman who created it.\n\nSeizing the memes of production\n\nKids getting exploited for their unpaid viral labour is, of course, how the digital economy tends to work. Schimkowitz notes that \u201ca lot of people who are creating memes are teenagers\u201d who don\u2019t automatically protect their viral creations with trademark applications. And while monetizing memes may be a modern phenomenon, Schimkowitz points out that \u201cmarketing people taking trends from teens is not a new thing \u2013 that\u2019s being happening since they invented teenagers\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that young meme-makers never profit from their viral frame. However, it does seem that the kids who get credit for their creations tend to be white, while the kids who have their work appropriated tend to be black. In 2016, for example, a teenager called Daniel Lara shot to international fame after a video of his friend yelling \u201cDamn Daniel, back at it again with the white Vans\u201d went viral. Lara got a lifetime supply of Vans, was invited on Ellen, and trademarked the phrase Damn Daniel through the company Damn Daniel LLC.\n\nDanielle Bregoli, who went viral in 2016 for saying what sounded like \u201cCash me ousside\u201d and \u201chow bout dat\u201d on Dr Phil, has also cashed in on her 15 minutes of fame. She trademarked both phrases and has threatened legal action against companies using them. Bregoli now has a $1m publishing deal with Pulse Music Group and a $900,000 partnership with CopyCat Beauty. All thanks to going viral when she was 13.\n\nWhen memes become too mainstream\n\nNow, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve just fired off a hilarious tweet and are watching it transform into a viral meme in front of your eyes. If you call up a trademark lawyer quickly enough, are you going to be laughing all the way to the bank? Not necessarily.\n\nSometimes memes or phrases become so ubiquitous that they are impossible to trademark. Peckham notes, for example, that that US Trademark Office declined to register applications to trademark OCCUPY WALL STREET (yes, I regret to inform you people really tried to trademark OCCUPY), explaining that \u201cthe more commonly a phrase is used, the less likely that the public will use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a trademark\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo doubt the same fate arguably would doom an application for a viral internet meme if it were used ubiquitously by many users,\u201d Peckham says. However, while the phrase \u201c100% that bitch\u201d may have become pretty mainstream, Peckham expects that Lizzo\u2019s trademark application will ultimately be approved. While \u201ccommon, it\u2019s not quite a big, newsy or politically transcendent as OCCUPY\u201d.\n\nUltimately, says Peckham, there are two big lessons to take away from the Lizzo trademark dispute. First, \u201cif you want to protect or leverage your great idea or catchy phrase, you should act fast before it goes viral\u201d.\n\nSecond, the internet always wins in the end. \u201cEven if the law isn\u2019t on the side of the original writer of the tweet, the power of the internet might still ensure that a second user (Lizzo) cannot cash in by getting a monopoly on the phrase either. The internet will likely own it in the long run \u2026 which means we can all go on claiming we are all that bitch.\u201d", "description": "A British singer tweeted the line in 2017, creating controversy around Lizzo\u2019s attempt to copyright it, but this isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s happened", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27148b985211766072a3d88db43f5b44e48301ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eff1bb1ac7198eff0ae3e50efe941282"}
