O\u2019Brien (...) as our new National Security Advisor,' Trump tweeted | Fredrik Persson/AFP via Getty Images Trump to nominate hostage negotiator as national security adviser \u2018He will do a great job\u2019, says U.S. president in a Tweet.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will appoint U.S. hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien to replace John Bolton as his national security adviser.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O\u2019Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nO\u2019Brien was among a list of five potential contenders Trump named the day before, a list that had apparently been narrowed down from about 15 in the days immediately after Bolton\u2019s ouster.\n\nO\u2019Brien comes aboard as Trump faces a number of crises in the Middle East, including attempts to broker peace in Afghanistan with the Taliban as well as between the Israelis and Palestinians. The administration is also grappling with how to confront an increasingly hostile and restless Iranian regime, on which Trump announced a fresh package of sanctions just moments before announcing he'd tapped O'Brien for his new post.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force one Wednesday, Trump praised O\u2019Brien, an aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with whom he\u2019s worked with to free Americans held captive abroad, as \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently touted his administration\u2019s record in freeing American hostages \u2014 sometimes referring to himself as \u201cchief hostage negotiator\u201d \u2014 at times giving himself an outsize role in efforts to free American hostages. The president recently made a show of dispatching O\u2019Brien to Sweden to assist in the case of rapper A$AP Rocky, who\u2019d been jailed on assault charges. Trump tweeted incessantly about the case from Washington.\n\nO\u2019Brien beat out Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who served as Bolton\u2019s chief of staff; Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; Keith Kellogg, national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence; and Ricky Waddell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump.\n\nEarly on in the search, the president ruled out appointing Pompeo to take over the post in addition to his duties at the State Department, though White House counselor Kellyanne Conway signaled he would play an outsize role assisting Trump with selecting the administration\u2019s fourth national security adviser.\n\nBut last week, he downplayed the record levels of turnover in his administration, asserting that a job in his White House was a hot commodity.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it badly, as you can imagine,\u201d he said last week. \u201cA lot of people want the job \u2014 it\u2019s a great job. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump. It\u2019s very easy actually to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don\u2019t have to work.\u201d", "description": "\u2018He will do a great job\u2019, says U.S. president in a Tweet.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1158925534-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
