Her comments will air in full Monday on CBS\u2019s \u201cThis Morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome folks try to make these decisions by making political calculations and looking at political strategy,\u201d she said, according to a clip the network provided. \u201cFor me, once I decided what I want to do, I think it\u2019s just the most authentic decision to let people know how I feel.\u201d Sanders told CBS that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement was \u201cvery significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexandria has been a political phenomenon,\u201d he said, according to a CBS transcript.\n\nSaturday was Sanders\u2019s first campaign appearance since his Oct. 1 heart attack, after which he had two stents inserted into a blocked artery in a Las Vegas hospital. He took the stage in Queens clad in black to loud cheers and the strains of AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black.\u201d\n\nBehind in the polls to Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Vermont senator is looking to leverage the charismatic 30 year-old lawmaker, who has outsized influence with left-leading and younger voters. The two already have overlapping support, though.\n\nReady to Struggle\n\nSanders told supporters he was ready for an \u201cepic struggle\u201d for the 2020 Democratic nomination and the White House, working in many elements of his typical stump speech focused on opposition to the \u201cbillionaire class and corporate elite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have some bad news for them,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThings are going to change, and we\u2019re going to have a government of working people and not the One Percent.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a first-term member of Congress from the Bronx, earlier spoke to a crowd of several thousand -- Sanders said his campaign had a permit for 20,000 people, and not all who wanted to could get in -- in Queens. She vowed a \u201crevolution at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nOn a sunny autumn afternoon, Ocasio-Cortez said Sanders had been seminal in her political awakening: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I heard of a man by the name Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing and a living wage.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, on CBS, said Sanders had been fighting for people at the bottom of the economic ladder for years. She cited her own experience working at a restaurant where she earned little in wages, had no health insurance, and faced sexual harassment.\n\n\u2018People Like Me\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astounded me, frankly, that the senator has been there fighting for me long before I got to the halls of Congress and fighting for people like me,\u201d she said.\n\nHer endorsement was announced after Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio, along with that of fellow progressive firebrand, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Their support, which lets Sanders burnish his appeal with the next generation of voters, is seen as a setback for Warren, another progressive favorite.\n\nSanders\u2019s heart attack kept him off the trail for two weeks. Coming months after he received seven stitches after cutting his head on a glass shower door, it focused attention on his health and age as primary contests loom in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yet the 78-year-old appeared healthy and energetic at Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nAge an Asset\n\nAlso on hand Saturday was filmmaker Michael Moore, a progressive figure for decades, who portrayed Sanders\u2019s age as an asset. \u201cA 78-year-old knows what a pay raise is,\u201d he said. \u201cA 78-year-old knows what a pension is.\u201d\n\nAnalysts, though, say it will take more than a good bill of health and some solid endorsements to turn around his campaign, which now hovers between third and fourth place in national and key state polls.\n\nThe endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez and Omar will grab immediate interest but \u201cwon\u2019t stem the tide of support for Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Michael Gordon, a Democratic strategist who worked for the Clinton and Gore campaign in 1992 and 1996.\n\nStill, Sanders is the money leader in the race, hauling in $25.3 million in the third quarter, giving him the funds to push well into the primaries. A key test comes Nov. 1 in Iowa, when the top candidates will speak at a state Democratic party dinner that often is the point at which support starts to coalesce in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, said Robert Shrum, a former top adviser to Democratic nominees Al Gore and John Kerry.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said her move to formally endorse Senator Bernie Sanders on Saturday, weeks after the 2020 Democratic candidate suffered a heart attack, was an \u201cauthentic decision.\u201dThe influential first-term lawmaker was interviewed at Sanders\u2019s Saturday rally in", "authors": ["Laura Litvan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eRFtm297JnVfOQTyQ6SL.Q--~B/aD0xNjY4O3c9MjUwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/c86ea600275852fd63c02a7155773b73", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
