Authorities have deployed boats to rescue residents from the submerged areas.\n\nWhile many have received tents from the government, others, including Ananju Devi, said they have not been given adequate aid.\n\n\"We are unable to cook any food. How can we? We are just sitting around and getting by somehow,\" Devi said.\n\nThe authorities have asked schools to remain closed until Tuesday as a preventive measure.\n\nIndia's Meteorological Department said the intensity of rainfall over Bihar was very likely to abate.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
