It is, I think, time for the president to grow a spine by \u201cstrapping his holster to his hip,\u201d looking the bandit, Magashule and co, in the eye and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go for the draw.\u201d\n\nThere was, no doubt, a sigh of relief within conservative white circles and other minority groups when Ramaphosa won the ANC presidency ahead of other, dubious ANC candidates. But he has and continues to squander that support by a yellow bellied silence as it relates to serious matters, one, of many, being the open slaughter of farmers all around the country. He has been more outspoken about village latrines (and yes, that is important) than the matter of life and death related to the vitally important matter of food supply for the nation.\n\n\n\nThe country is on a knife's edge, and the hour is late. Now is the time for you, Mr President, to draw back your shoulders, push out your chest and emerge from the shadows of mediocrity and become the people's champion. I do, along with Madiba of old, believe that you, Cyril, have it in you. We\u2019re praying for you. Your greatest hour lays before you. Please don\u2019t disappoint us.\n\nPierre van den Berg\n\nParys, Free State", "description": "The country is on a knife's edge, and the hour is late.
