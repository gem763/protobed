Just waiting on permits,' he tweeted.\n\nAll Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 10, 2019\n\nIf delivered, those Powerpack would help to keep charging stations in California online amid widespread utility shutdowns in California that could impact 800,000 homes.\n\nNorthern California's biggest energy utility, PG&E, has begun to cut shut down grids in response to inclement weather they fear could spark devastating wildfires similar to those witnessed throughout the last several years.\n\nTesla has a little more than 1,600 super charging stations across America and dozens in the Bay area alone (Bay Area map pictured above)\n\nMalfunctioning equipment has been linked to major disasters like last year's Camp Fire that scorched swaths of the state and killed 85 people.\n\nMusk also mentioned that the company is working to outfit its charging stations with solar power so that they can remain live even when facing utility issues.\n\n'Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts,' Musk tweeted.\n\nThe promise by Musk comes after Tesla owners were given a waning on Tuesday via their cars' computer system and corresponding app to charge vehicles prior to the planned blackouts.", "description": "According to a tweet from Musk, Tesla plans to ship the energy storage units - large batteries capable of holding and delivering electricity - in 'just a few weeks' while permits are sorted out.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/20/19555152-0-image-a-5_1570735178865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
