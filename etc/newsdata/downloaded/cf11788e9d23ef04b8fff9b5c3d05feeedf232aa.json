The Straits Times\n\nIndividual letterbox units may one day make way for vending machines that dispense both letters and parcels, turning overstuffed letterboxes and missed deliveries into problems of the past.\n\nSingPost unveiled prototypes of a new smart stamp and letterbox system that aims to cut down on lost and misdelivered mail, and improve delivery efficiency on Tuesday (Sept 24).\n\nTogether, they would enable Singapore residents to track mail items at every stage of their journey, receive notifications when they arrive, and retrieve them from a storage unit using facial recognition and other forms of authentication.\n\nThe smart stamps, embedded with data matrix codes \u2013 similar to a QR code \u2013 can encode information on the sender and receiver. If rolled out, it would allow all basic mail items to be tracked.\n\nRead Also: After flak and service issues, SingPost now has a website that lets residents know and rate their postmen\n\nThe smart letterbox concept, demonstrated in the form of a machine with a touch-screen interface, scans the data matrix codes to sort letters and packets deposited by postmen into storage slots.\n\nTheir contents can be retrieved using a smartphone app, among other forms of authentication. The machine can also be integrated with a parcel locker unit.\n\nThe innovations, which SingPost claims as world firsts, were unveiled by its Singapore head and chief executive of postal services Vincent Phang at the Home Delivery Asia retail logistics conference and exhibition on Tuesday.\n\nHe said in a speech that the innovations represent SingPost\u2019s vision of the future of the postal service.\n\nSingPost\u2019s Singapore head and chief executive of postal services Vincent Phang speaking about smart stamps and letterboxes. The Straits Times\n\nIf realised, the new system would address challenges such as productivity, while significantly reducing SingPost\u2019s carbon footprint, he added.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, Vincent said SingPost is in discussions with the authorities on the system\u2019s possible implementation, but there are no concrete plans for now.\n\nHe declined to reveal the cost of SingPost\u2019s investment in the system and the potential cost of a nationwide roll-out.\n\n\u201cThis technology is available in the market \u2013 it\u2019s just putting the whole thing in place together as a complete workflow,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if the use of smart stamps would lead to higher postage rates, he said it is too early to comment.\n\nRead Also: SingPost fined S$100,000 for not meeting delivery standards in 2017 \u2013 here are some of its biggest hiccups in recent years\n\nOn whether the stamps would be used only for local mail, he said: \u201cWe hope at the national level we can have it for every delivery, but at international level there\u2019s consistent discussion around making every single delivery trackable. And perhaps that could be our contribution to the international framework at some point in time if it\u2019s demonstrated that it works here.\u201d\n\nAs a dense city-state with mainly high-rise buildings, Singapore has \u201cnatural advantages\u201d in trialling the proposed smart postal system, he said.\n\nHe told The Straits Times in July that SingPost was working on a smart stamp prototype that would enable mail articles to be scanned and tracked throughout the delivery process.\n\nLarger and smarter letterboxes have also been on the cards as most e-commerce deliveries sent through the mail are shoebox-sized and cannot fit in a standard letterbox.\n\nThey are part of plans by SingPost to upgrade the postal infrastructure, which has come under strain as letters are replaced by larger e-commerce items.\n\nRead Also: SingPost postman arrested over mail in rubbish bin; IMDA expresses \u2018grave concerns\u2019 over incident\n\nRole specialisation for postmen and the extension of doorstep delivery hours are among the measures that have been put in place by the postal service provider to address service lapses that have plagued it since the start of the year.\n\nNew Soon Tee, director of the trade and connectivity cluster at the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), said at the event\u2019s opening address that last-mile delivery operators have been challenged by the growth of e-commerce.\n\nThe IMDA\u2019s Locker Alliance pilot, launched in December last year, has helped to address issues such as failed deliveries, which are costly as return shipments cost almost three times as much as parcel deliveries, he said.\n\nIt allows Punggol and Bukit Panjang residents to collect their purchases from e-commerce sites, such as Lazada and Taobao, from more than 60 parcel lockers located at Housing Board blocks.\n\nRead Also: Singapore launches new framework for data protection officers to improve data security in Singapore\n\nThe lockers, operated by SingPost and blu, are also located at MRT stations in Bukit Panjang, Chinese Garden, Lakeside and Boon Lay.\n\nMore than 44,000 locker transactions have been performed as of August, said New, who called on e-commerce and logistics professionals attending the event at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre to join the alliance.\n\nThe IMDA, which administers the Postal Services Act, said in response to queries that it is \u201csupportive of SingPost\u2019s move to harness technology to improve its operational efficiency and service standards\u201d.\n\n\u201cIMDA will review SingPost\u2019s proposals when we receive them,\u201d it said.\n\nRead Also: Singapore is setting aside S$40 million to build \u2018open and inclusive\u2019 5G Innovation ecosystem", "description": "Business Insider - The smart stamps, embedded with data matrix codes \u2013 similar to a QR code \u2013\u00a0can encode information on the sender and receiver..
