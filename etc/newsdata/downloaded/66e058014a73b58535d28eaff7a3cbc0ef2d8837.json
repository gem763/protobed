(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nSome might think that, for a variety of reasons, the Redskins\u2019 newly available head coaching job wouldn\u2019t be particularly attractive to potential candidates. Well, Rex Ryan thinks otherwise, as he was happy to point out Wednesday.\n\nIn fact, the former Jets and Bills coach knows of one prominent NFL figure who would definitely be interested: Rex Ryan.\n\nIn an appearance on ESPN, for which he has worked as an analyst since 2017, Ryan was asked if \u201canybody\u201d wants the Redskins job.\n\n\u201cOf course \u2014 everybody,\u201d Ryan responded. \u201cI would take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to be lined up for this job,\u201d he added. \u201cThey absolutely will.\u201d\n\nI missed this one from Rex on @GetUpESPN commenting on #Redskins coaching vacancy...\u201dI would take it\u201d #HTTR pic.twitter.com/SSBAjjho0O \u2014 Earl Forcey (@EarlForcey) October 9, 2019\n\nIf nothing else, it may be nice for the Redskins to know that, should they strike out on their top targets, they have a fallback option. And for what it\u2019s worth, during the Daniel Snyder era, those with previous NFL head coaching experience (Marty Schottenheimer, Joe Gibbs, Mike Shanahan) have tended to fare a bit better than first-timers (Steve Spurrier, Jim Zorn, Jay Gruden).\n\nFine, as long as we\u2019re making a case for Ryan, here goes:\n\nTrack record as a defensive mind \u2014 in four seasons as a Ravens coordinator and six as the Jets\u2019 head coach, his defenses never ranked lower than 11th in yards allowed (although they were 19th in both of his seasons in Buffalo).\n\nWent 46-50 in New York, but managed a winning record (33-29) in games started by Mark Sanchez and went 8-8 with Geno Smith starting every game as a rookie, before the bottom fell out (4-12) the following season, pushing his overall record below .500.\n\nWas considerably more successful with the Jets, including two trips to the AFC championship game, than Todd Bowles (24-40, no playoffs), who replaced him and is now rumored to be under consideration by Snyder.\n\nWent 15-16 with the Bills, but his winning percentage (.484) was better than that posted by any of his five predecessors (Doug Marrone, Chan Gailey, Dick Jauron, Mike Mularkey, Gregg Williams). Hey, I\u2019m trying.\n\nGarrulous personality could take spotlight off less-than-popular team president Bruce Allen, and easygoing, player-friendly nature could help defuse an occasionally tense atmosphere in Ashburn.\n\nOf course, speaking of that garrulous personality, it helped create a narrative, particularly with the Jets, that Ryan\u2019s mouth was writing checks his coaching acumen couldn\u2019t quite cash. And while it\u2019s reasonable to point to being saddled with subpar quarterbacks as a major factor in Ryan\u2019s below-.500 career record, it\u2019s also more than fair to suggest that he didn\u2019t do much to make them better.\n\nThat last point is key, because the Redskins will surely want their next coach to get the most out of their young quarterback and first-round pick, Dwayne Haskins. In addition, Ryan hasn\u2019t prowled the sidelines since 2016 and might be out of step with the latest schemes, particularly as spread-offense concepts have flourished.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that Ryan\u2019s brother Rob is already on Washington\u2019s staff. If one Ryan is good, two is better, right?\n\nOkay, maybe not.\n\nStill, with hotshot coaches such as Oklahoma\u2019s Lincoln Riley and Ohio State\u2019s Ryan Day sending signals that they\u2019re not interested in the Redskins job, at least someone is touting it as a coveted gig. Or, in any event, a gig a certain someone covets, even if that person is extremely unlikely to actually get hired.\n\nIf, though, the Redskins are looking for a coach who can combine bluster with blitz packages \u2014 not to mention cap a motivational speech with, \u201cLet\u2019s go and eat a [expletive] snack!\u201d \u2014 they need look no further than Ryan.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho will be the next Redskins\u2019 coach?
