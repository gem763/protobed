Dr. Loretta Christensen \u2013 the chief medical officer on the Navajo Nation for Indian Health Service, a partner in the research \u2013 said 781 women were screened during an initial phase of the study that ended last year.\n\nAmong them, 26% had concentrations of uranium that exceeded levels found in the highest 5% of the U.S. population, and newborns with equally high concentrations continued to be exposed to uranium during their first year, she said.\n\nWorkers, residents were put at risk\n\nThe research is continuing as authorities work to clear uranium mining sites across the Navajo Nation.\n\n\u201cIt forces us to own up to the known detriments associated with a nuclear-forward society,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, who is an enrolled member of Laguna Pueblo, a tribe whose jurisdiction lies west of Albuquerque.\n\nThe hearing held in Albuquerque by U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, Haaland and U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, all Democrats from New Mexico, sought to underscore the atomic age\u2019s impact on Native American communities.\n\nThe three are pushing for legislation that would expand radiation compensation to residents in their state, including post-1971 uranium workers and residents who lived downwind from the Trinity Test site in southern New Mexico.\n\n'Totally rehabilitated': Judge clears record of 21-year-old jailed 10 days for oversleeping jury duty\n\nThe state\u2019s history has long been intertwined with the development of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, from uranium mining and the first atomic blast to the Manhattan project conducted through work in the once-secret city of Los Alamos. The federal Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, however, only covers parts of Nevada, Arizona and Utah that are downwind from a different nuclear test site.\n\nDuring the hearing, Haaland said one of her own family members had lost his hearing because of radiation exposure. At Laguna Pueblo, home to her tribe, the Jackpile-Paguate Mine was once among the world\u2019s largest open-pit uranium mines. It closed several decades ago, but the cleanup has yet to be completed.\n\n\u201cThey need funds,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cThe job was not completed.\u201d\n\nFederal officials 'feel a sense of urgency'\n\nDavid Gray, a deputy regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said the mine illustrates uranium mining and milling\u2019s lingering effects on Indian Country.\n\nOn the Navajo Nation, he said, the EPA has identified more than 200 abandoned uranium mines where it wants to complete investigation and cleanup under an upcoming five-year plan, using settlements and other agreements to pay for the work that has taken decades.\n\nUdall, who chaired the hearing, acknowledged federal officials had shown progress but that the pace of cleanup has proven frustrating for some community members.\n\n\u201cThey feel an urgency,\u201d Udall said. \u201cThey feel that things need to happen today.\u201d\n\nGlobal climate protests: Activists pour fake blood on famous Wall Street bull\n\nIn her testimony, Christensen described how Navajo residents in the past had used milling waste in home construction, resulting in contaminated walls and floors.\n\nFrom the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, millions of tons of uranium ore were extracted from the Navajo Nation, leaving gray streaks across the desert landscape, as well as a legacy of disease and death.\n\nWhile no large-scale studies have connected cancer to radiation exposure from uranium waste, many have been blamed it for cancer and other illnesses.\n\nBy the late 1970s, when the mines began closing around the reservation, miners were dying of lung cancer, emphysema or other radiation-related ailments.\n\n\u201cThe government is so unjust with us,\u201d said Leslie Begay, a former uranium miner who lives in Window Rock, an Arizona town that sits near the New Mexico border and serves as the Navajo Nation capital. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t recognize that we built their freedom.\u201d\n\nBegay, who said he has lung problems, attended the hearing with an oxygen tank in tow. The hearing held in the Southwest was especially meaningful for him after traveling in the past to Washington to advocate for himself and others, he said.\n\nContributing: Felicia Fonseca, Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/08/navajo-uranium-found-women-babies-new-mexico-study/3907899002/", "description": "Among the 781 women screened in the study, 26% had concentrations of uranium that exceeded levels found in the highest 5% of the U.S. population.", "authors": ["Mary Hudetz", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
