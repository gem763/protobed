One of the victims killed in the attack was a 15-year-old girl.\n\nIt was the second mass shooting in Texas in less than a month, following the massacre at an El Paso Walmart on August 3.\n\nBelow is a repeatedly updated post covering everything we know so far.\n\nThe Attack\n\nThe shooter is going around shooting moving vehicles. Stay off I-20 between Odessa and Midland. pic.twitter.com/IeQ4oBF1nP \u2014 Ernest Villanueva (@ErnestVillanu13) August 31, 2019\n\nAccording to Midland and Odessa authorities, the gun-violence nightmare began around 5:15 p.m. on Saturday when two Department of Public Safety troopers stopped a gold sedan for failing to signal a turn on Interstate 20 in Midland. The driver, later identified by law-enforcement officials as 36-year-old Seth Ator, pointed an AR-style assault rifle at the DPS officers through his rear window and opened fire without stopping the vehicle. One trooper was shot. The gunman then drove off and fled west to Odessa, about 20 miles away, shooting at other cars as he did. He shot another person where I-20 meets Loop 338 on the eastern edge of the city, then continued his drive-by mass shooting through the city, firing indiscriminately at cars, shoppers, and pedestrians as he drove. The city was was placed on lockdown and police worked to clear the roads.\n\nWent from waiting for coffee at Starbucks in #Odessa to ducking as multiple gunshots were fired off less than 50 yards away. Hearing there are multiple victims throughout Midland and Odessa, prayers for all. pic.twitter.com/FDHsRFVki1 \u2014 Dustin Fawcett (@Dfaw21) August 31, 2019\n\nAn Odessa woman, in a devastating interview with CBS-7, sobbed as she described hearing loud pops while rolling away from an intersection on 338 near I-20, then noticed the shooter and the \u201cvery large gun\u201d he was pointing at her. She drove away aggressively, hearing shots behind her, and said that the gunman followed and tried to drive up alongside her. She said she thought, from the look on the man\u2019s face, that he was not behaving \u201cmethodically,\u201d but randomly trying to hurt people. She wept as she entertained the thought that the gunman likely targeted others after not being able to shoot her.\n\nOne witness was in his truck at the Starbucks on Odessa\u2019s East 42nd Street when he heard a volley of gunfire, then ducked down and tried to shield his newborn daughter in the back seat. He told the Washington Post that when he climbed out of his truck after the shots stopped, he saw at least three cars that had been struck with bullets. Inside one car in a nearby intersection, a 17-month-old girl had been shot in the face through her bottom lip, knocking out her teeth. He said the girl\u2019s mother held the still-conscious baby while a nearby off-duty paramedic tried to stop the bleeding. Paramedics arrived within minutes and rushed them away. (She survived, according to a GoFundMe page raising money for her family.)\n\nA worker at the adjacent Twin Peaks restaurant was also shaken after seeing the blood-covered toddler. He told the New York Times that \u201cit was chaos in a matter of seconds\u201d as the gunman drove through the area firing, and that people inside the restaurant screamed and flipped over tables for cover. Outside, he and his co-workers ran to the car containing the infant, and he also saw an older woman inside another car, bloodied and hyperventilating in shock after a bullet had passed through her car windows. It had apparently missed her, but the glass shrapnel had not.\n\nLess than a block from the Starbucks, the Music City Mall was evacuated, sending shoppers and staff into a terrified sprint through and from the complex.\n\nAnother witness, a doctor, told the Associated Press that as he tried to treat a woman who was shot in her shoulder at an intersection, the gunman drove back past the same intersection again. \u201cHe was just everywhere,\u201d the witness exclaimed. It is not yet clear how the shooter was able to move so widely about the city, as some reports indicate he was at times being chased by police.\n\nThe gunman eventually attacked and killed a U.S. Postal Service worker in a residential neighborhood, ditching his car and hijacking her post-office van. A witness reportedly saw the gunman pull the postal worker from the van, shooting her twice and killing her. The shooter then drove off and continued firing at victims from that vehicle. This led to reports that there were two gunmen driving around shooting at people in the city.\n\nVIDEO of the police response in Odessa, as officers worked to find the suspect who opened fire in Midland and Odessa, killing 5 people and injuring 21 others.

Two officers were shot in the ensuing gun battle, which killed the assailant.\n\nBy the end, seven people were dead and another 22 injured. Hours later, much of the city was a taped-off crime scene \u2014 wherever the shooter\u2019s bullets had struck.\n\nOne witness shared the below video of the final confrontation between police and the gunman to social media, later telling CNN that, \u201cI could see the officer walking up to the mail van and discharging his weapon into it, and I believe that\u2019s when the shooter was killed.\u201d\n\nJust witnessed a shooting in Odessa, Texas. #breakingnews Posted by Alex Woods on Saturday, August 31, 2019\n\nOther witnesses shared harrowing videos of what the end of the crisis looked and sounded like while hugging the ground in terror:\n\nMy heart just broke...

So glad they shot him dead! pic.twitter.com/wVuPUNXu1O \u2014 Jacqueline Rico (@jackiearico) August 31, 2019\n\nThe Victims\n\nSeven people were killed and another 22 injured, including three law-enforcement officers, according to Odessa police. On Saturday, police originally said that five victims had been killed, but on Sunday the Odessa police department raised the death toll to seven, noting that the dead ranged in age from 15 to 57. Police also revised the total number of injured from 21 to 22.\n\nThe identities of the dead and injured began to emerge on Sunday \u2014 at first thanks to the wave of GoFundMe pages which now inevitably follow every mass shooting.\n\nThis is Leila Hernandez. She was 15 years old and fatally killed in the Odessa #MassShooting.\n\n\n\nShe had just celebrated her quincea\u00f1era. Leila played for her school\u2019s basketball team. Her brother, Nathan, was injured and remains hospitalized.#GunReformNow pic.twitter.com/G4HqYIC8tr \u2014 Kristen Clarke (@KristenClarkeJD) September 1, 2019\n\n15-year-old Leilah Hernandez was shot and killed while she and her older brother walked out of a dealership with the keys to new truck he had just bought. Nathan Hernandez, 18, was also shot and remained hospitalized in intensive care on Sunday. Her mother was at the dealership too. Leilah\u2019s grandmother, Leyva, told the Washington Post that when the gunman drove by shooting, Leilah\u2019s mom pushed her 9-year-old son under a car, and Nathan was shot in the arm while trying to shield his sister. Another bullet struck Leilah in the shoulder:\n\n\u201cHelp me, help me,\u201d was all the girl said as she died, Leyva said. It took 20 minutes for the ambulance to arrive. Authorities put pressure on the wound from both sides, but \u201cit was just too much blood coming out,\u201d Leyva said. They told Nathan as they took him away in an ambulance: \u201cYour sister did not make it.\u201d\n\nMs. Hernandez was a student at Odessa High School and had just celebrated her quincea\u00f1era in May. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help her family with their expenses.\n\nThis is Mary Granados pic.twitter.com/88SwGCobzW \u2014 Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) September 1, 2019\n\nU.S. Postal Service mail carrier Mary Granados, 29, was also killed by the gunman. According to her twin sister, Ms. Granados was nearing the end of her shift and they were speaking on the phone when the gunman attacked her and hijacked her post-office van. A former co-worker has set up a GoFundMe page to help her family pay for the funeral expenses.\n\nJoseph Griffith, a 40-year-old former math teacher, was killed while sitting in his car at a traffic light with his wife and two kids. \u201cThis maniac pulled up next to him and shot him,\u201d his sister told the Post.\n\nAlso killed in the attack was 25-year-old Edwin Peregrino, who was visiting his parents in Odessa two weeks after moving out of their home. According to the Washington Post, his 23-year-old sister, Eritizi Peregrino, said that he had run outside the house after hearing the sound of gunfire, then was shot by the gunman as he sped by. Her husband was also shot in the drive-by but survived. \u201cYou\u2019re not even safe at your own house,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Saturday, 13 victims were sent to Permian Regional Medical Center in Odessa, which was also locked down because of the shooting. Seven victims were listed in critical condition on Saturday night, and police said that one victim was still fighting for their life on Sunday. One victim died of their injuries at the hospital on Saturday, according to a hospital official.\n\nThe official also confirmed that one of the survivors was a toddler, who appears to have been the girl who was shot in an intersection near the East 42nd Street Starbucks in Odessa. A GoFundMe page set up of by a friend of the girl\u2019s family has identified her as 17-month-old Anderson Davis\ufeff. According to the page, one bullet fragment hit her in the chest, and another put a hole in her lip and tongue and knocked her front teeth out. By midnight local time on Saturday, the GoFundMe effort had raised more than $100,000 for the little girl and her family in less than six hours.\n\na special request of prayers for officer Zack Owens. he is family and needs all the support he can get through his recovery. he is a hero. Love you roomie \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/CUApxaH8Yh \u2014 Kathy Venegas (@KathyyVenegas) September 1, 2019\n\nAccording a GoFundMe set up by a family member to help with expenses, Midland police officer Zack Owens was shot multiple times in the arm and hand on Saturday, and was seriously injured in his eye by glass shrapnel. Zack\u2019s brother, Jake, also serves on the Midland Police Department.\n\nState trooper Chuck Pryor was also shot in the line of duty during the attack. A GoFundMe set up to help his family pay their expenses reports that he was shot in the face, but was in serious but stable condition after having surgery on Saturday night.\n\nMari\u00e1n Boado Encinosa was also among those shot during the rampage. According to a GoFundMe for her and her family, she was shot three times in the abdomen, chest, and elbow \u2014 which ultimately she lost due to the severity of the wound. Encinosa has a 10-month-old baby.\n\nThe Gunman\n\nOdessa police chief Michael Gerke said on Sunday that the department would not publicly identify the gunman, so as to not \u201cgive him any notoriety for what he did.\u201d Later, off camera, police identified the shooter as 36-year-old Odessa resident Seth Aaron Ator.\n\nPolice said on Sunday that the gunman had a criminal record, but it\u2019s not yet clear what those crimes were. There was no outstanding warrant for the gunman at the time he was pulled over.\n\nAs has been the case with a majority of mass shooters in the U.S., the gunman was armed with an AR-style assault rifle. How the shooter obtained his weapon was not yet clarified by early Sunday evening.\n\nThe shooter\u2019s motive is not yet clear, but he was pulled over on Saturday for failing to signal a turn after multiple reports had apparently come in saying that he was driving erratically.\n\nMass Panic and Confusion Struck Two Cities at Once\n\nThe mobile nature of the rampage over a range of many miles \u2014 and the fact that the gunman fired on his victims from two different vehicles \u2014 fueled mass confusion and fear in both Midland and Odessa. The sister cities, which are home to some 260,000 people, spent hours placed on lockdown while authorities tried to figure out what was happening. In addition, multiple authorities in each announced that there were separate active-shooter events, rather than just one. CBS-7/KOSA TV an Odessa television station operating out of the Music City Mall, evacuated its studio during a live broadcast \u2014 with anchors narrating what was happening over their microphones while they fled. The University of Texas of the Permian Basin, also in Odessa, ordered its students to shelter in place.\n\nThis is the exact moment when - while they were reporting LIVE ON AIR - the team at @CBS7News was evacuated due to a threat of an active shooter in the mall.\n\n\n\nThey kept broadcasting via audio from the parking lot.#Odessashooting #TexasShooting #Odessa pic.twitter.com/oerxMLlkoO \u2014 Muhammad Lila (@MuhammadLila) August 31, 2019\n\nTexas, Again\n\nThe attack was the second mass shooting to strike Texas in less than one month. On August 3, a white nationalist terrorist armed with an assault-rifle and extended-ammo magazines killed 22 people and injured 24 others in a racially motivated massacre at an El Paso Walmart. That attack \u2014 which was followed by another massacre less than 12 hours later in Dayton, Ohio \u2014 horrified the nation and led to yet another wave of calls for more gun-control measures across the country.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, who has repeatedly worked to loosen gun-control regulations in his state, called for unity on Saturday and offered his \u201cunwavering support\u201d to victims of the new shooting in west Texas. He added that he wanted \u201cto remind all Texans that we will not allow the Lone Star State to be overrun by hatred and violence.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that four of the ten worst mass shootings in American history have been committed in Texas, the state was hours away from enacting multiple new laws that would further reduce gun-control measures as the west Texas shooting was playing out. As on Sunday, schools will not be able to ban gun owners from keeping their weapons in their vehicles outside, and landlords and homeowners will no longer be able to ban gun owners from keeping weapons on their property. Another new law allows gun owners to carry handguns inside houses of worship in the state unless those houses of worship notify them that doing so is prohibited. (The change prompted Mormon leaders to implement a new policy banning the possession of firearms in all LDS churches, unless the person with a gun is a police officer.)\n\nCNN: Today\u2019s shootings in West Texas occurred a day before a spate of new laws easing gun restrictions are set to take effect. Here are the laws: pic.twitter.com/uPohCpWg7b \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 1, 2019\n\nAn Epidemic With No End in Sight\n\n2019 has been another horrifying year in American gun violence. Per the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more people are shot or killed, the rampage in west Texas was one of five mass shootings on Saturday, raising the year\u2019s total number of mass shootings to 281, including 38 in August alone.\n\nPer the GVA\u2019s statistics, those shootings resulted in the deaths of 305 people, with 1,181 left injured. 67 of the deaths occurred in August.\n\nThis is a developing news story and this post will be continuously revised and updated as more information becomes available. This post has also been updated to remove an incorrect summary of one of Texas\u2019 new gun laws: Houses of worship in Texas have not been prohibited from banning firearms inside their buildings \u2014 the new law made open and concealed carry explicitly legal in houses of worship unless they prohibited that and provided notice to gun owners.", "description": "At least 7 people were killed and another 22 injured after 36-year-old Seth Ator opened fire on drivers and pedestrians while speeding through the west Texas cities of Midland and Odessa.
