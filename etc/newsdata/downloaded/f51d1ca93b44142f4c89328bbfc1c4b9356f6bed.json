This is a breath of fresh air for the Canadian economy, which released weaker data and weaker data late last month.\n\nThe Bank of Canada now has their hands full. The BOC will have their next policy meeting on October 30 (which happens to be the same date as the next FOMC policy meeting) where they will release their projections for the economy as well. At the last meeting, BOC President Poloz stated that \u201cthe current degree of monetary policy stimulus remains appropriate.\u201d Will this still be true?

If price breaks through these levels, can push much lower toward the 1.2000/1.2300 levels over the lower term.\n\nDaily USD/CAD\n\nSource: Tradingview, FOREX.com\n\nResistance comes in above at the break of the trendline near 1.3240 and above that near prior lows (which now act as resistance) near 1.3270.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Joe Perry covering: USD/CAD.
