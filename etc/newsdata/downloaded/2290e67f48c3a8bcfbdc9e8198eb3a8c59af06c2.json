But congressional oversight in general is not novel at all. Indeed, the practice of legislative oversight is older than America itself. The British Parliament, in the 17th and 18th centuries, regularly engaged in such investigations, and American colonial legislatures followed suit, assuming \u201cusually without question, the right to investigate the conduct of other departments of the government and also other matters of general concern brought to their attention,\u201d as written by the legal scholar C. S. Potts in the 1926 University of Pennsylvania Law Review. After the adoption of the Constitution, Congress, too, quickly began exercising its oversight authority. As early as 1792, Congress asked the Washington administration for \u201cnecessary\u201d \u201cpersons, papers and records\u201d to enable it to investigate a military defeat in the Northwest Territory, and James Madison and other Framers voted in favor of the inquiry.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly approved of Congress\u2019s exercise of its oversight authority, recognizing that Congress\u2019s power to investigate is \u201cbroad,\u201d encompassing \u201cinquiries concerning the administration of existing laws, as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes,\u201d and \u201csurveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them.\u201d As the Court explained in 1927, a \u201clegislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change.\u201d Thus, the Court said, \u201cwhere the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information\u2014which not infrequently is true\u2014recourse must be had to others who do possess it.\u201d\n\nIn 1957 the Court made it clear that just as Congress has the power to investigate in order to determine whether and how to legislate, Congress also has the power to investigate when it is \u201crelated to, and in furtherance of\u201d another \u201clegitimate task of the Congress.\u201d Thus, it follows that Congress can investigate when the results of the investigation could lead \u201cto further action on the part of the [Congress] within its constitutional powers,\u201d such as a decision to impeach.\n\nWithout this oversight power, Congress\u2019s ability to fulfill its role in our constitutional system would be considerably hampered. For one thing, it would be less effective as a legislative body, deprived of the tools necessary to determine what its legislative priorities should be and how it can legislate most effectively. Indeed, while the oversight efforts that are making the headlines are the ones related to the White House, the House has already this year held nearly 200 hearings and sent more than 430 letters seeking information on a wide range of topics like emergency health care for veterans, abuse at skilled nursing facilities, natural disasters as a result of climate change, the impacts of trade policies on the U.S. economy, and the policies and priorities of the Food and Nutrition Service. In some of these cases, Congress is seeking information that will help it decide whether to pass new legislation; in others, it is trying to ascertain how legislation already passed is being implemented. Both of these are legitimate purposes, and oversight is necessary to both of them.", "description": "Congress needs the executive branch to comply with its requests, not only to monitor an unruly president, but for the more basic work of writing legislation.", "authors": ["Brianne Gorod", "Appellate Counsel At The Constitutional Accountability Center"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74Q7B/facebook.jpg?1569610382", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
