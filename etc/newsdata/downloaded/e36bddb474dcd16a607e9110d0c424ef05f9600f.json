Dave Birkett, Detroit Free Press\n\nForty-eight hours after they traded one of his best friends to the Seattle Seahawks, Darius Slay is still coming to grips with theDetroit Lions' decision to move on from starting safety and team captain Quandre Diggs.\n\nSlay spoke to reporters for 7 1/2 raw minutes Thursday and shared real emotion about Diggs' departure and the message it sends to the locker room.\n\n\"It basically say it don\u2019t matter who you is,\" Slay said. \"No matter how much you put in, at the end of the day it\u2019s a business so that\u2019s how I just look at it. Nobody\u2019s safe, in my opinion.\"\n\nThe Lions traded Diggs and a 2021 seventh-round pick to the Seahawks on Tuesday for a 2020 fifth-round choice.\n\nDiggs, a Pro Bowl alternate last season, was a leader and one of the most beloved players in the Lions' defensive backs room, but the team felt his play had slipped this season.\n\nNFL trade deadline: Seven deals that teams should make\n\nWeek 8 picks: Do Patriots, 49ers remain unbeaten?\n\nSlay, who expressed his disappointment with the trade on Twitter immediately after it went down, said he still felt \"like (expletive)\" Thursday.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been playing together five years,\" Slay said. \"Shoot, team captain, so I mean, for that to happen it\u2019s kind of crazy but I guess that\u2019s the business part of it. That was crazy, though.\"\n\nSlay, who stayed away from the team in a contract dispute this offseason before reporting to training camp without a new deal, said he has not talked to either Lions coach Matt Patricia or general manager Bob Quinn about a move he clearly feels made the team worse in the near-term.\n\nThe Lions (2-3-1) hope to use the draft capital acquired from the Diggs trade to bolster their team before next week's trade deadline.\n\n\"I ain\u2019t talking to neither one of them about that,\" Slay said. \"That\u2019s they problem. I\u2019m working. That\u2019s all I do. I work. There\u2019s not no kind of relationship or nothing like that, just I\u2019m here, I work here, this is my job. I got to do my job.\"\n\nAsked if Tuesday's trade gives him pause about his own situation, Slay, who's under contract through the 2020 season, said, \"Anybody can get traded but I personally wouldn\u2019t care, my personal feeling. Like I said, it\u2019s a business. I wouldn\u2019t care. It is what it is, go on about the next day.\"\n\nAsked to clarify, Slay said it's not that he wants out of Detroit.\n\n\"Nah, don\u2019t look like that,\" he said, \"I\u2019m just saying the business part of it, they just doing that. That just say that it don\u2019t matter, they\u2019re making choices up there so you just got to live and deal with it.\"\n\nSlay, a two-time Pro Bowler, aggravated a hamstring injury in last week's loss to the Minnesota Vikings and is not expected to play in Sunday's game against the New York Giants.\n\nHe declined to address his health Thursday, and when asked if he had any fears about being moved at next Tuesday's NFL trade deadline Slay said emphatically, \"(Expletive) no.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s the last thing I\u2019m worried about,\" Slay said. \"I don\u2019t give a damn, honestly. I don\u2019t. So like I said, I just work. Doesn\u2019t matter where I\u2019m at. If I\u2019m here, if I\u2019m somewhere else. I just go to work.\u201d\n\nAsked if he wanted to remain in Detroit after the deadline, Slay did not offer a direct answer.\n\n\"Do I want to? Be where else?\" he said. \"I\u2019m saying I\u2019m here to play ball. Like I said, it don\u2019t matter if I\u2019m here or not. That\u2019s what I want to do, I just want to play ball.\"\n\nSlay said he did not view the Lions' business-like approach to shaping the roster as unique in any way. And he said whatever happened with Diggs, it won't impact his play on the field.\n\n\"It got nothing to do with on the field,\" Slay said. \"I\u2019m a dog. I just go play ball. That\u2019s not going to affect nothing on the field. It will just affect the relationship in the locker room, the (communication). I probably got to communicate a lot different with folks because me and Quandre have stuff going on, just like I had with GQ (Glover Quinn), how he understood me or how I play, he knew how to play his game from me. Now I just got to build a relationship with other young guys, figure out how we\u2019re going to connect all these pieces together.\"", "description": "A two-time Pro Bowler, Darius Slay did not directly answer when asked Thursday whether he wants to stay with the Detroit Lions at the trade deadline", "authors": ["Dave Birkett", "Published P.M.
