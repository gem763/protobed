I fully believe we should all be free to pursue our passions. Go climb your mountain\u2014and love every minute of it.\"", "description": "\"Good Morning America\" host Lara Spencer giggled during a segment .09/02/2019 3:23:47AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/108/14a864b1-5fc4-4a77-91f2-02b1b735886f.jpg"}
