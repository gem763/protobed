Negotiators will work on a draft and revisit it at mid-November meetings in Chile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be a problem getting it papered,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cChina wants it badly. We want it, also.\u201d\n\nThe president previously said he wanted to strike a single big deal with China, though on Friday he said it makes sense to handle such a major pact in sections. He said \u201cphase two\u201d will start immediately after they finalize the first stage.\n\nThorny issues appear to remain, including China\u2019s tendency to subsidize core industries and force U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese partners.\n\nMr. Trump said they made progress on technology transfers and will deal with it partially in phase one.\n\nChinese tech firm Huawei, a controversial player in 5G technology, is not part of the pact, though Mr. Trump said the parties did reach some form of agreement on intellectual property.\n\nStocks on Wall Street rose substantially on positive trade developments Friday, but the market pared some of its gains late in the day when the details emerged.\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Charles E. Grassley said the first-phase deal was good news for farmers, though follow-through will be key.\n\n\u201cAfter so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,\u201d the Iowa Republican said.\n\nThe U.S. and China have been trading tit-for-tat tariffs on each other\u2019s goods for months, rattling investors, importers and retailers. The National Retail Federation welcomed Friday\u2019s progress but said \u201cuncertainty continues\u201d and they\u2019d like to see all tariffs lifted.\n\nOverall talks between the two nations fell apart earlier this year but resumed in recent weeks.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer hosted a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday and Friday in Washington.\n\nMr. Liu sat in the Oval Office on Friday across from Mr. Trump, who struck a softer tone than usual in speaking about his geopolitical rival.\n\nHe praised the Chinese as tough negotiators and said he was impressed by ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the start of communist rule in Beijing.\n\nMr. Trump also said he didn\u2019t inject politics into the deal by prodding China to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a prominent 2020 rival.\n\n\u201cI have not brought up Joe Biden,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cChina can do whatever they want with respect to the Bidens.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
