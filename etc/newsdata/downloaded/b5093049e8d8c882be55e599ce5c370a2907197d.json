He will be arraigned on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned for the safety of people whose life circumstances may make them more vulnerable to criminal predators,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said.\n\n\u201cWith this new evidence, I authorized the filing of criminal charges against Ed Buck.\u201d\n\nBuck is already facing a wrongful death lawsuit by the mother of Gemmel Moore, a 26-year-old black man who died in Buck\u2019s apartment on July 27, 2017\u2014surrounded by drug paraphernalia, according to court papers.\n\nThe suit says Buck solicited Moore for sex and insisted he inject him with crystal meth. In Moore\u2019s last journal entry, dated Dec. 3, 2016, he wrote, \u201cIf it didn\u2019t hurt so bad, I\u2019d kill myself, but I\u2019ll let Ed Buck do it for now.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department opened an investigation into Moore\u2019s death, but Lacey declined to file criminal charges\u2014prompting Moore\u2019s family to name the DA as a co-defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nJasmyne Cannick, an activist who has been working with Moore\u2019s family, rushed to Buck\u2019s home when she heard the news of his arrest. \u201cI\u2019m a bit overwhelmed right now,\u201dshe tweeted. \u201cThis has been two years of my life fighting for this man to be arrested.\u201d\n\nIn January, Timothy Dean, another gay black man, died at Buck\u2019s home\u2014on a mattress littered with drug paraphernalia and sex toys, according to a coroner\u2019s report.\n\nBuck claimed that Dean had been acting bizarrely before he left him to take a shower and that he was unconscious when he returned. He told investigators he performed CPR on Dean for 15 minutes before calling paramedics, the coroner\u2019s report said.\n\nThrough his attorney, Buck has denied wrongdoing. The lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nProsecutors said they will ask the court to set bail at $4 million for Buck, a retired entrepreneur who has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to political action groups and local and national politicians.", "description": "Authorities say Buck injected the man, who survived, with methamphetamine last week.", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_776,w_1381,x_581,y_506/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568777911/GettyImages-104365045_k0w01g", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
