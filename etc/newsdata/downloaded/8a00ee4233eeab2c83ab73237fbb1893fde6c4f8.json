Three Train Passed Over Drunk Man Who Slept On Rail Tracks In MP Ashok Nagar & He Didn't Even Know", "language": "en", "text": "People do the craziest things when they are drunk, and the worst or the best part (that depends from person to person) is that, at times, they do not even remember the things they did or things that were done to them when they are sloshed. That is exactly what happened to a man from Madhya Pradesh - he was in a life-threatening situation for hours and he has no recollection of it.\n\nA locomotive pilot contacted the police when he saw a body lying on railway tracks in Ashok Nagar, Madhya Pradesh. By the time police reached the location, three trains had already passed over the body of the man and naturally the police thought he might be dead. However, to the surprise of the police officials the man suddenly woke up when they reached the spot, and said randomly, \"Papa aa gaye (Father has come).\"\n\nOn questioning it was found that the man\u2019s named was Dharmendra and he was drunk.\n\nAFP/Twitter\n\nHe was so \u2018out' that he did not even know that he was lying on train tracks and that three trains had passed over him. It was when the police informed him that he was nearly run over by three trains, is when he snapped out of his stupor.\n\nReportedly, the man had passed out on the tracks two kilometres away from the Ashok Nagar railway station.\n\nHe was sent for a medical checkup by the police and later sent home.\n\nIt is nothing short of a miracle that the man survived three trains that went over him. He passed out in some safe position; what are the chances of that? And imagine how drunk a person has to be to first pass out on railway tracks and then not realize that three trains, passed over his body. Imagine being so high that people think you are dead and then you come back to life, only to say 'Papa aa gaye' to police officers.", "description": "People do the craziest things when they are drunk and the worst or the best ( that depends from person to person) is that at times they do not even remember the things they do or things being done to them when they are slouched.
