The pouches will still bear mandatory government warnings that they can cause mouth cancer, gum disease and tooth loss.\n\nBut the company will be able to advertise its tobacco pouches as posing a lower risk of lung cancer, bronchitis, heart disease and other diseases than cigarettes.\n\nThe pouches of ground tobacco, called snus - Swedish for snuff and pronounced \u201csnoose\u201d - have been popular in Scandinavian countries for decades but are a tiny part of the U.S. tobacco market.\n\nUsers stick the teabag-like pouches between their cheek and gum to absorb nicotine. Unlike regular chewing tobacco, the liquid from snus is generally swallowed, rather than spit out. Chewing tobacco is fermented; snus goes through a steamed pasteurization process.\n\nFDA acting commissioner Ned Sharpless said the agency based its decision on long-term, population-level data showing lower levels of lung cancer, emphysema and other smoking-related disease with the use of snus.\n\nSharpless added that the agency will closely monitor Swedish Match\u2019s marketing efforts to ensure they target adult tobacco users.\n\n\u201cAnyone who does not currently use tobacco products, especially youth, should refrain from doing so,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nStockholm-based Swedish Match sells its snus under the brand name, General, in mint, wintergreen and other flavors. They compete against pouches from rivals Altria and R.J. Reynolds. But pouches account for just 5% of the $9.1 billion-dollar U.S. market for chew and other smokeless tobacco products, according to Euromonitor market research firm.\n\nAnd public health experts questioned whether U.S. smokers would be willing to switch to the niche product.\n\n\u201cSnus products have a bit of a challenge\u201d among smokers who are used to inhaling their nicotine, said Vaughan Rees, director of Harvard University\u2019s Center for Global Tobacco Control.\n\nThe U.S. smoking rate has fallen to an all-time low of 14% of adults, or roughly 34 million Americans. But smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S., responsible for some 480,000 deaths annually.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision has been closely watched by both public health experts and tobacco companies.\n\nPublic health experts have long hoped that alternatives like the pouches could benefit Americans who are unable or unwilling to quit cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products. Tobacco companies are looking for new products to sell as they face declining cigarette demand due to tax increases, health concerns, smoking bans and social stigma.\n\nThe FDA itself also has much at stake in the review of snus and similar tobacco alternatives.\n\nCongress gave the FDA the power to regulate key aspects of the tobacco industry in 2009, including designating new tobacco products as \u201cmodified risk,\u201d compared with traditional cigarettes, chew and other products.\n\nBut until Tuesday, the FDA had never granted permission for any company to make such claims for its products.\n\nThe FDA is reviewing several other products vying for \u201creduced risk\u201d status, including a heat-not-burn cigarette alternative made by Philip Morris International. While electronic cigarettes are generally considered less harmful than the tobacco-and-paper variety, they have not been scientifically reviewed as posing a lower risk.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
