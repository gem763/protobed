But critics say cash often trumps animal welfare at many attractions.\n\nFor a price, visitors can ride and bathe with elephants, hold monkeys and pose for selfies with tigers. Animal rights groups have long criticised the industry, with chained-up animals kept in small quarters with inadequate veterinary care, or forced to perform tricks for tourists.", "description": "Inbreeding blamed as only 61 of 147 big cats survive after removal from tourist attraction", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aaa3c343456ce53aad6216e1c35dcc514382f3c/182_363_2990_1795/master/2990.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e17d65366d657354447c06172032d72", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
