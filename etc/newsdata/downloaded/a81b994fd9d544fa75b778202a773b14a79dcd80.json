two days after a summit of European leaders.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - long term critics of the backstop and partners of the Tory Party in Parliament - backed the proposals.\n\nIn a statement, the DUP said the plan \"demonstrates commitment to working with our neighbours\" in Ireland, and said the proposals respected \"the integrity of Northern Ireland's economic and constitutional position within the United Kingdom\".\n\nWhat is in the proposals?\n\nThe PM's plan centres around replacing the backstop - the policy negotiated between Theresa May and EU to try and prevent hard borders returning to the island of Ireland.\n\nMr Johnson has called it \"anti-democratic\", claiming it offers no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there.\n\nHis offer is for an \"all-island regulatory zone\", which would mean Northern Ireland would have to follow EU rules for goods.\n\nThere would be additional checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but the UK would not apply further checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Ireland.\n\nChecks relating to the single market are about product standards, to ensure goods comply with EU regulations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PM: Boris Johnson: \"It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready\"\n\nHowever, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK, so there would have to be new customs checks between North and South.\n\nThose checks would look at customs documents and the payment of tariffs, which allow goods to cross the border in the first place.\n\nThe government proposals suggest the vast majority of checks could be carried out electronically - but thinks a small number of physical checks would have to take place, either at business premises or at points on the supply chain.\n\nThe Stormont Assembly - Northern Ireland's parliament - would have to agree these proposals through a vote and would be given a vote every four years on whether to preserve them.\n\nThe government is also promising a \"New Deal for Northern Ireland\", with financial commitments to help manage the changes.\n\nIn his letter to the European President Mr Juncker, the PM said he hoped his offer could \"provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution\".\n\nLater, Mr Johnson will speak to Mr Juncker on the phone and the two sides' negotiating teams will also meet.\n\nImage caption Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals\n\nAhead of reading the plan, Mr Varadker said, despite wanting a deal, he would not agree to one \"at any cost\" and Ireland was \"ready for no-deal if that's what the British decide to do\".\n\nAnd before the proposals were submitted, a European Commission spokeswoman said they would examine the them objectively, adding: \"We will listen carefully to the UK.\"\n\nBut the spokeswoman also reminded the UK of its \"well-known criteria\", saying: \"In order for there to be a deal, we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop.\n\n\"[That means] preventing a hard border, preserving North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it.\"", "description": "The PM's plan would see Northern Ireland essentially stay in the single market for goods.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1650E/production/_109060419_9721e45b-c595-4a5c-b986-3916c4875d6b.jpg"}
