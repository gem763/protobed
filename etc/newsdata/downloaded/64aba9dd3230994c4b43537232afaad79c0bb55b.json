In the previous three times Villarreal have hosted Alaves, they haven't managed to earn a single point, losing on each occasion.\n\nAlaves haven't walked away from the Estadio de la Ceramica empty handed since 2006 and also did the double over Villarreal last term.\n\nDeportivo Alaves have won on their last three visits to Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica\n\nWho knows what that could do to Villarreal's players mentally. Calleja, though, insists there is no significance. 'We cannot trust these numbers or statistics,' he said this week.\n\n'We know every time they have come to this stadium they have put us in a lot of difficulties, so we know they are going to complicate us a lot again. We just have to focus on us and try and impose our game.'\n\nRecent records aside, this is expected to be a battle of attack vs defence - Villarreal are currently the second highest scorers in the league and Alaves have the third best defence. It's the recipe for a classic.\n\nSanti Cazorla (left) and Co will be keen to put an end to their recent hoodoo against Alaves\n\nLeganes vs Mallorca - Saturday, 3pm\n\nAs if things couldn't get any worse, Leganes' woes were compounded last week when they lost 2-0 against bitter rivals Getafe.\n\nA derby win would have been just the trick to kick them back into gear after an atrocious start, but alas, they remain bottom of the league, winless and managerless.\n\nIt's a sorry sight. And things aren't getting any easier for them.\n\nEn-Nesyri shows his frustration after missing a chance to score for Leganes this season\n\nMallorca are in red-hot form with two wins on the bounce, beating Real Madrid last time out\n\nOn Saturday, they will welcome a rejuvenated Mallorca side who have won two games on the bounce, most recently against Real Madrid.\n\nThey are operating on a budget smaller than most sides in the Segunda division and were playing in the Spanish third tier only two years ago.\n\nBoss Vicente Moreno has been the mastermind behind their meteoric rise. If you're wondering what his secret is though, you're wasting your time.\n\nMoreno is very protective of his methods and even made his team train behind closed doors for much of this week. So there could be an element of surprise come Saturday.\n\nAtletico Madrid vs Athletic Bilbao - Saturday, 8pm\n\nThese two clubs have history.\n\nThey were once 'brothers' that shared players during the pre La Liga era, but on Saturday Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao will very much be out for themselves.\n\nBoth Atletico and Bilbao are currently dealing with the backlash that comes with just one win in their last five league games.\n\nAtletico Madrid spent big money on new signings in the summer but have started slowly\n\nIn Madrid, Atletico fans have been revolting over their side's underwhelming start to the campaign - which has been heightened by their \u00a3200m summer splurge on new players - while boss Gaizka Garitano has been made the scapegoat for Bilbao's recent rut.\n\nPlayers from both sides stood defiant this week amid difficult periods. Koke insisted that there is no division with the fans, saying: 'I saw them singing and supporting us in our last game. That is important. They have a big role to play in helping us win the home games.'\n\nWhile Inigo Martinez gave a timely reminder of the wonders Garitano worked last season in an impassioned defence of his boss following the intense criticism.\n\nThis fixture is always a momentous occasion, and this weekend has the added spice of two teams desperate for three points.\n\nAthletic Bilbao boss Gaizka Garitano is under pressure, having won one of last five games\n\nGranada vs Real Betis - Sunday, 1pm\n\nGranada are third and Real Betis are 18th. Before the start of the season most would have assumed after nine games it would have been vice versa.\n\nBut no, newly-promoted Granada, who spent just \u00a36.5m this summer, are third with five wins from nine, and can actually go top with victory this weekend.\n\nIs this just a case of them riding some early-season luck, or do they actually have the legs to maintain this form?\n\nFormer Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas certainly doesn't think their start to the season is a flash in the pan and this week warned the rest of the league about their title credentials.\n\n'Look at Leicester a couple of years ago,' he said earlier this week in reference to their unlikely Premier League triumph back in 2016.\n\nGranada have been this season's surprise package and can go top with victory on Sunday\n\nSummer signing Nabil Fekir pictured in action for Real Betis during a La Liga game last month\n\nReal Betis, on the other hand, find themselves in a middle of a crisis. They lost some key players in the summer but appeared to do an adequate job of replacing them.\n\nNabil Fekir's signing from Lyon outlined their ambitions for the season, but for one reason or another, things have not gone according to plan.\n\nCEO's Angel Haro and Jose Miguel Lopez Catalan attended their training sessions this week and held meetings with the players in a bid to inspire them ahead of Sunday's clash after Betis slipped into the relegation zone for the first time since they took over the club.\n\nThey may be in poor form, but 18th, you'd think, is a false position for Betis and they will provide the perfect acid test to see if there is some substance in Casillas' claims.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nPS\n\nReal Sociedad can be the main beneficiaries of Real Madrid not playing this weekend and will move up to second if they beat lowly Celta Vigo.\n\nValencia will also hope to catapult themselves into the top-six conversation when they travel to Osasuna while Sevilla face a tricky game against in-form Getafe.\n\nValladolid are also in action hosting Eibar in a relegation six-pointer this weekend while Levante face off against Espanyol.", "description": "This was the weekend the world was supposed to have its eyes fixated on the most significant game in Spain.
