Trump's defenders need a better argument.", "language": "en", "text": "The Founders made clear that an impeachable or convictable offense need not be a crime. Hamilton said it applied to 'the misconduct of public men.'\n\nThe tactics some Republicans are using to defend President Donald Trump against being impeached (or indicted) by the House and convicted (or removed from office) by the Senate include confusing the public about what these terms mean. One thrust is to suggest that for a president to be impeached, he must have committed a crime.\n\nFor example, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., perhaps Trump\u2019s most vocal defender on Capitol Hill, indicated his supposed openness to impeachment with this statement: \u201cSure. I mean, show me something that is a crime.\u201d Graham, a former Air Force lawyer who is now chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, surely knows better. His disingenuous statement was drastically misleading about the meaning of impeachment.\n\nReining in a president\n\nGraham\u2019s definition of impeachment as necessarily involving a crime goes against the history of the Constitution's impeachment clause and undermines the very point of the exercise, which is to hold a president accountable for abuses of power between elections. A crime might be involved, but the critical point is that an abuse of power need not be a crime.\n\nNot all crimes are impeachable offenses, and not all impeachable offenses are crimes. An abuse of power occurs when a president reaches beyond the understood limits on his governing, or violates the constitutional requirement that the president \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"\n\nFor example, when President Richard Nixon used the Internal Revenue Service to harass his perceived enemies, he was abusing his power, and this became part of one of the charges against him (Article II) in the articles of impeachment drawn up against him by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974. Significantly, Article II also held a president accountable for the acts of his aides.\n\n\"George Washington Addressing the Constitutional Convention,\" painted by Junius Brutus Stearns in 1856.

In taking the vengeful step of interfering in a government contract decision to punish a business he despises, the president undoubtedly committed an impeachable offense.\n\nThe Founders believed that there must be a way for the public, through its elected representatives, to keep a rein on a president throughout his term of office; that the very purpose of creating a presidency was to avoid establishing in power someone who would be beyond reach until the next election, like a king. As they drafted the Constitution in Philadelphia in 1787, the Founders added to Article II, which governs the presidency, a section that said, \u201cThe president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nChecks and balances: In impeachment, the Founders gave us a sacred duty\n\nThe vagueness of these terms has perplexed scholars and political practitioners over the years, but the Founders left enough guidance to make it clear that an impeachable or convictable offense need not be a crime.\n\nAccording to Raoul Berger, author of \u201cImpeachment: The Constitutional Problems,\u201d one of the first authoritative books on impeachment (which caused a run on stores when it came out in the fall of 1973, when the possibility of impeaching Nixon became a live topic), the Founders lifted the wording of the impeachment clause from English law, which provided a way of punishing a king\u2019s ministers, an indirect way of denying a king absolute power.\n\n'Abuse or violation' of public trust\n\nAs it happened, while the Founders were drafting the Constitution, the English House of Commons (on which our House of Representatives was modeled) was considering the impeachment of Warren Hastings, a former governor general of British India. The statesman Edmund Burke, opening the proceedings, said: \u201cIt is by this tribunal that statesmen who abuse their power are accused by statesmen, and tried by statesmen, not upon the niceties of a narrow jurisprudence, but upon the enlarged and solid principles of state morality.\u201d\n\nAll roads lead to Russia: On Ukraine, Syria, Trump and Russia, we're still dealing with Putin's 2016 chaos bomb\n\nAlexander Hamilton offered probably the best explanation of the impeachment provision in Federalist 65, one of the papers that he, James Madison and John Jay wrote after the Constitutional Convention to explain and promote the new experiment. He said the purpose of impeachment was to deal with \u201cthe misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d\n\nNothing in these most authoritative comments suggests that an impeachable offense need be a crime. It\u2019s clear, in fact, that the criteria are much broader. If Graham and other conservatives want to defend the president to the end (it's not clear that all of them do), they need to brush up on their reading and try to find more valid grounds \u2014 if they can.\n\nElizabeth Drew is a Washington journalist and author of \u201cWashington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon\u2019s Downfall.\u201d Follow her on Twitter: @ElizabethDrewOH\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
