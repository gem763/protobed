The US has been locked in a costly trade war with China for more than a year, though negotiators are scheduled to resume talks in Washington on Thursday.\n\nAnd Congress has yet to approve a North American trade deal that Trump's trade team negotiated last year with Canada and Mexico.\n\nBroader deal in the works\n\nWhile rewarding US farmers, the new US-Japan deal does not resolve differences over trade in automobiles. Trump has said the two countries will continue to work on a more comprehensive agreement on that front.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose import taxes on foreign cars, claiming they pose a threat to US national security given the ramifications for artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that Trump had assured him a previous agreement to spare Japan from new car tariffs still stood.\n\nBut Japanese automakers were disappointed that the US kept existing auto tariffs at 2.5 percent.\n\nMonday's deal was first announced at the August Group of Seven Summit in Biarritz, France. At the UN gathering last month, the two countries signed an agreement in principle.\n\nThe limited trade pact also includes market-opening commitments on $40bn worth of digital trade between the US and Japan.\n\nThe deal, Overby said, \"is important, but it's still not the whole enchilada\". US business groups are holding out for a broader deal that would give US companies more access to Japan in businesses such as insurance and pharmaceuticals.\n\nTrump has long complained about the large trade deficit with Japan, which came to $58bn last year. Japan is the world's third-biggest economy, behind the US and China.", "description": "With improvements in access for US agricultural goods, officials hope agreement will pave the way for wider accord.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/248d432a26ff4a8d9fce002db326b48a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
