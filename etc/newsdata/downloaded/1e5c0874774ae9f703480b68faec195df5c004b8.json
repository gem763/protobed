In coffee shops, they mix them into lattes; in grocery stores, they line the beauty/pharmacy aisles. With tinctures specifically designed to help you relax at work or ease you into a good night\u2019s sleep, all your stressed-out and sleep-deprived friends seem to be suddenly floating on a cloud of ease and comfort with their newfound CBD routines. But with so many new products and options all popping up so quickly, it\u2019s hard not to have a million questions.\n\nWill CBD Get Me High?\n\nFirst things first: CBD is not the same thing that made you cough a lot and then scarf chips in high school. Most people use the words \u201ccannabis,\u201d \u201chemp,\u201d and \u201cmarijuana\u201d interchangeably, but cannabis is actually the name for the genus of plants. All of the plants within the cannabis genus contain compounds called \u201cphytocannabinoids\u201d and there are dozens of different ones. The most well known are THC and CBD. THC is the only one that gets you \u201chigh.\u201d\n\nThe leaves and flowers of marijuana plants are used to make joints and edibles because they typically contain 15-20% THC. CBD oils are made from the hemp plants, which contain, at most, 0.3% THC. That\u2019s why CBD oils don\u2019t get you high.\n\nApparently CBD Is \u201cNatural\u201d \u2013 What Does That Really Mean?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the scientific terms when you\u2019re just trying to figure out how CBD oil can help you relax after work, without the hangover you get when you suck down a bottle of wine to unwind. But, even though the terms can be complex, learning about the way CBD oils actually work in the body is actually pretty cool.\n\nHumans (all mammals, actually) naturally produce compounds called \u201cendocannabinoids.\u201d Endo means \u201cwithin\u201d\u2013as in, within your body. All these compounds work together to keep your body\u2019s systems functioning normally, an interconnected network inside your body that\u2019s of course called the Endocannabinoid System.\n\nPhytocannabinoids like CBD (phyto meaning \u201cplant\u201d\u2013as in, a compound that occurs naturally in a plant) work with the Endocannabinoid System. Basically, if you regularly deplete yourself through stressful workdays and activity-filled weekends, a CBD oil can help.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Hemp Seed Oil and CBD Oil?\n\nMany CBD products are made from \u201chemp extract oil\u201d\u2014and the word \u201cextract\u201d in there is key, because there are also products called \u201chemp seed oil.\u201d Despite sounding exactly the same (confusing), hemp seed oil is actually a different thing.\n\nHemp seed oil, also sometimes called \u201chemp oil\u201d, is derived from the seeds of the hemp plant only, no phytocannabinoids there. The oil is rich in healthy omega-3 fatty acids, so it can do wonders for your skin, but beyond that it doesn\u2019t have the same benefits as a CBD oil. It\u2019s important to look out for this distinction to make sure you\u2019re getting what you\u2019re actually looking for.\n\nThe hemp extract oils that are the basis of CBD products are made from the flowers and leaves of the hemp plant, where all those beneficial phytocannabinoids live.\n\nWhat\u2019s Actually In These CBD Oils?\n\nCBD is the best known non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid, but it\u2019s only one of dozens that live in the leaves and flowers of the hemp plant. While each phytocannabinoid has its own health benefits, they actually work best when they\u2019re consumed together, something scientists refer to as the \u201cEntourage Effect.\u201d\n\nSome CBD oils contain only CBD, but some companies, like Charlotte\u2019s Web, are using the science behind the Entourage Effect to make more complete hemp-derived supplements. For their CBD oils, Charlotte\u2019s Web has grown their own full-spectrum proprietary genetics which allow all of the phytocannabinoids in the plant to work together in synergy.\n\nTheir 17MG CBD oil is formulated with first-time users in mind, so if you\u2019re at the beginning of your CBD journey, it\u2019s the perfect place to start. Alongside the 80 phytocannabinoids, the oil also contains naturally occurring terpenes, flavonoids, and other valuable hemp compounds that work synergistically to heighten the positive health benefits. The oil comes in four flavor options\u2014Mint Chocolate, Lemon Twist, Orange Blossom, and Olive Oil\u2014which can be a perfect boost in your morning power smoothie or lunchtime salad dressing, or enjoyed on their own.\n\nSo, This is a Natural Solution to Help Deal With My Everyday Stress?\n\nSimilar to the way the natural wine movement is promoting wines devoid of mystery dyes and chemicals, Charlotte\u2019s Web takes care to ensure that the plants they use to make their products are free of contamination. They only intervene into the way the plants grow to account for the way human-made contaminants have affected an otherwise natural system.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s Web tests the soil they use for heavy metals before they plant, supervising the entire grow process of each seed that goes into that dirt. They make their oils using the entire plant and test the final product to ensure that each bottle contains the right levels of phytocannabinoids.\n\nAny Other Questions? No? Good!\n\nWhile there\u2019s a lot of confusing language around CBD oils, once you break it down it\u2019s actually easy to understand what you\u2019re putting in your body and what benefits it can give you. CBD works with your body\u2019s natural systems to help you manage everyday stress, sleep better, and function at a higher level\u2014no matter what your day throws at you.\n\nThe best way to ensure that the CBD you\u2019re taking is up to the standards you\u2019d have for everything else you consume is to invest in products that you can trust, from companies with holistic practices like Charlotte\u2019s Web.
