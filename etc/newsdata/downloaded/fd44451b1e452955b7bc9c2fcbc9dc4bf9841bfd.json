Today's circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday's circumstances. My ruling is therefore that the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so.\"Bercow added it would break longstanding conventions for Members of Parliament to debate and vote on the deal agreed in Brussels last week.Instead, the Speaker noted that it would pursue the route of getting the legislation required for Britain's departure from the EU through parliament first, ruling out having a \"straight yes or no vote\" on the agreement.The government expressed deep regret that the Speaker yet again denied a chance to deliver on the will of the British people but signaled that it would proceed to introduce the necessary legislation.The UK is due to leave the EU in 10 days.With the UK government presenting the law that would implement the Brexit deal to the Commons, the parliamentary process will begin on Tuesday, local time.KIM Da-mi, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
