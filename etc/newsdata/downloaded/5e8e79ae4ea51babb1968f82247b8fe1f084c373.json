It\u2019s part of their ongoing quest to impeach President Trump on some of the most politically motivated evidence (and I use that term lightly) in recent memory. This is all traced back to July phone call Trump has with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he allegedly shook the leader down, demanding a corruption probe into Hunter Biden or risk having aid blocked. Well, the transcript of the call was released; there was no quid pro quo. A whistleblower report brought this allegation up, which was based on second-hand accounts; this person did not listen in on the call. The whistleblower is reportedly a CIA agent, a registered Democrat, had worked with a 2020 Democratic candidate, and had another citation for political bias which we don\u2019t know about. That part has been redacted. So, you can see\u2014there\u2019s no reason to be suspicious about this shoddy and secretive effort by Democrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election (via Politico):\n\nHouse Democrats issued a subpoena to Energy Secretary Rick Perry as part of their ongoing impeachment inquiry.
