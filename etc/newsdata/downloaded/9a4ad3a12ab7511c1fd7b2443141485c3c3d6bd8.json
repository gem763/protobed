But we need a deal. A deal that, in the short term, enables a 'business-as-usual' transition for as long as it takes to negotiate and implement the future trading relationship.\"\n\nIn the longer term, the industry needed frictionless trade with the EU, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU without an agreement on Oct. 31 if necessary, although lawmakers have passed legislation that they say will force him to seek a delay from Brussels.\n\nThe autos sector, Britain's biggest exporter of goods, is concerned that World Trade Organisation tariffs of 10% on vehicles alongside new customs checks and border delays could halt production if there is a disorderly Brexit.\n\nLast week, Nissan, which runs Britain's biggest car factory, said such tariffs would make its business unsustainable in Europe.\n\nThe SMMT said its survey was based on responses from 158 member companies polled in September.
