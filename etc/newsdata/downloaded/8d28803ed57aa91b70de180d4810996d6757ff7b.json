'I have nothing to prove. But he has something to prove. We know he does.\n\nNurmagomedov is 'not ready to shake hands' with McGregor and is not focused on a rematch\n\n'There's a lot of businessmen here and I think most of them will tell me to fight him because it'll bring money. I'd fight all the main contenders first, and I could fight him to benefit my agricultural projects.\n\n'I have to say that Tony Ferguson deserves it more. You have to give him credit. He is on a 12-fight win streak and he deserves it more than Conor.'\n\nPoirier has stoked up interest that he could be the man to fight McGregor on his return to the ring following the pair's online spat last week.\n\nMcGregor and Poirier originally met in UFC 178 in Las Vegas more than five years ago, when McGregor took less than two minutes to end his opponent's night.\n\nEarlier in the week, Poirier tweeted that he had 'no clue' who he would fight next, before retweeting a fan who said: 'Stop lying, you're fighting Conor in Dublin.'", "description": "Conor McGregor's hopes of securing a lucrative rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov look to have have been dashed after the Dagestan fighter confirmed he is targeting Tony Ferguson.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19029746-0-image-a-7_1570522386288.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
