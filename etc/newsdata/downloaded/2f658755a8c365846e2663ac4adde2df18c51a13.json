But Ronnie\u2019s evasive, isolating behavior immediately began raising eyebrows amongst the roomies.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s put us through so much that every time he\u2019s quiet, he\u2019s buried in his phone, we\u2019re all like, \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s going on with him and Jen?\u2019 \u201d Vinny wondered. (The two have a well-documented history of alleged abuse on both sides.)\n\n\u201cClearly, Ron has a pattern of keeping a lot of stuff quiet and not opening up and then kind of waiting to explode and everything comes out,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing with him.\u201d\n\nJen Harley; Ronnie Ortiz-Magro | Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images; Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images More\n\nPauly \u201cDJ Pauly D\u201d DelVecchio was also concerned that things were about to get ugly.\n\n\u201cIf you were ever curious about the ingredients for a Ron-page, they are: a pissy look on your face, check; buried in your phone, check; disheveled hair, check; storming off to the bathroom, check. Tick, tick, tick. That\u2019s a ticking time bomb to a Ron-page.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jersey Shore\u2018s Angelina Pivarnick Suing FDNY Supervisor for Allegedly Sexually Harassing Her\n\nThey headed out to brunch the morning of Vinny\u2019s premiere, and while Ronnie was in the bathroom, Angelina Pivarnick got a message from none other than Jen herself.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden my phone is blowing up and it\u2019s Jen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those text messages are f\u2014ing insane. \u2018Ron went to Cabo, went MIA, been texting me crazy s\u2014 all hours of the night, stayed longer, blocked me from everything. He just went completely whack.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cLike, what is really going on right now? I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s sober or not,\u201d Angelina wondered of Ronnie, who at the time had just completed a 30-day stint in rehab. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the f\u2014 is lying at this point, and I\u2019m very scared.\u201d\n\nAngelina Pivarnick | Jim Spellman/FilmMagic More\n\nRELATED: Why Jersey Shore\u2018s Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Checked Into Rehab \u2014 I Was \u2018Tired of the Chaos in My Life\u2019\n\nEveryone else was equally confused.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s weird that Ron\u2019s baby mama Jen is reaching out to our family, our friends, instead of reaching out just to him,\u201d said Pauly. \u201cShe\u2019s going around [his] back and talking to the girls. Sometimes I just wish Ronnie would be honest with us about what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "description": "Jersey Shore: Jen Harley Claims Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Went 'MIA' for a Week", "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LuOTkm7ZpyDRxkkkAVWgQQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/10b0d554cb9808674e78eb8e94a84854", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
