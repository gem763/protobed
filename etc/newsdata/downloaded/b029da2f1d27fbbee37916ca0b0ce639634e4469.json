The NHS watchdog NICE is still considering whether to roll it out in the UK.\n\nLed by Andrew Lawrence, a professor in neuroscience and addiction, the new trial will see participants receive either Belsomra or placebo treatment daily for seven to ten days in hospital.\n\nThey will then continue their treatment for up to six months at home with regular follow-ups.\n\nThe study will examine sleep measures in trial participants, as well as looking at alcohol withdrawal symptoms and ongoing alcohol use.\n\nBelsomra is thought to block the binding of a series of amino acids in parts of the brain involved in addiction, known as the orexin system.\n\nThe medication also targets the amygdala, a brain region associated with mood disorders, including depression and anxiety - which also cause people to drink.\n\nProfessor Lawrence said: 'The orexin system demonstrates just how complicated addiction can be.\n\n'We know that the chronic intake of alcohol greatly disrupts sleep and wake patterns which, in turn, can drive the brain to further seek and consume alcohol.\n\n'Over 155,000 Australians are hospitalised each year from alcohol use disorder.\n\n'Yet despite the significant social and economic burden of this disease, no new treatments have been approved in Australia in over two decades.'", "description": "Scientists from The Florey Institute and St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, will give the sleeping pill to 128 alcoholics over six months.
