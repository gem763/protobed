The twin developments were part of an accelerating diplomatic effort to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal that the Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of last year.\n\nAhead of a Thursday deadline set by Tehran to again ramp nuclear enrichment activities beyond the deal\u2019s limits, France proposed Tuesday that Iran be offered the new financing on the condition that it refrain from further breaches of the pact.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian, after a long meeting with Iranian economists and central bank officials in Paris Monday, told reporters that such a line of credit could only work with the acquiescence of the Trump administration \u2014 something the White House appears unlikely to embrace.\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus Tuesday was on increasing the pressure on Tehran. The State and Treasury Departments announced new sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s space agency, charging that the agency was developing ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. mandates under the guise of a civilian program to launch satellites into orbit.\n\nThe sanctions come after a rocket exploded last week at Iran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Space Center in what an Iranian officials have said was a technical malfunction during a test.\n\n\u201cSpace launch vehicle (SLV) technologies, such as those developed by Iran\u2019s space program, are virtually identical and interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. Following last week\u2019s explosion, President Trump tweeted a surveillance image depicting the apparent aftermath of the incident and declared that the U.S. had played no role in the failure.\n\nIran has sought help from the other 2015 deal signatories as the U.S. sanctions have decimated its economy, cut off its export markets and sent the currency plummeting. An Iranian tanker briefly detained by British authorities in Gibraltar on Tuesday turned off its tracking signals off the Syrian coast, fueling speculation it would unload its cargo there in defiance of U.S. sanctions.\n\nRussia also reportedly is offering Iran a lifeline as economic relations between the two intensify. Officials in Crimea, seized by the Kremlin from Ukraine five years ago have reportedly offered Iran access to its ports in the Black Sea to skirt a U.S. effort to choke off Iran\u2019s oil exports.\n\nGeorgy Muradov, the deputy prime minister of Crimea\u2019s Russian-backed government, told Russia\u2019s state-run TASS news agency last week that Crimea is \u201csending signals\u201d of cooperation to Iran \u201cgiven the anti-Iranian policy of the United States,\u201d the Moscow Times reported Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIran can take advantage of our shipping opportunities and river-sea canals, transporting oil over the Volga-Don canal, via Crimea, to the Black Sea,\u201d Mr. Muradov told the Russian news service.\n\nThe 2015 deal reached between the U.S., Iran, China, Russia and Western European powers had curtailed Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for relief from international economic sanctions. The Trump administration unilaterally pulled out last year and began reimposing sanctions both on Iran and on foreign companies that trade with Tehran.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top administration officials say the goal is to pressure Tehran into a broader deal that addresses the full range of its \u201cmalign\u201d activities \u2014 including its backing of militant proxy organizations in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.\n\nIran has so far shown little appetite for such negotiations, particularly when other international signatories to the 2015 deal have spent the past year trying to keep the agreement alive.\n\n\u2981 This article was based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
