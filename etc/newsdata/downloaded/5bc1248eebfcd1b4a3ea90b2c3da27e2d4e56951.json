Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe tension-filled encounter ended in dramatic fashion when both Mertens and Sabalenka were drawn into the net and Barty sent a lob over both their heads.\n\nSabalenka raced back to track it down and managed to put it back in play but Azarenka misfired with her overhead smash.\n\nMertens fell to the court and Sabalenka looked to the sky in disbelief before they embraced.\n\nAzarenka and Barty outplayed their opponents for much of the match but were only able to convert two of their eight break point opportunities while Mertens and Sabalenka won all four of their break point opportunities.\n\nThe win caps a dominant run by the pair, who completed the Sunshine Double with wins in Indian Wells and the Miami Open this year before making their first appearance in a major final together.\n\nMertens said they fed off the energy of the lively New York crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s the crowd. I mean they keep me going every time,\u201d the Belgian said in an on-court interview.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we won a Grand Slam. It\u2019s all so new,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a good team and I hope we\u2019re going to play doubles again in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Belarusian Sabalenka tipped her hat to her opponents for the thrilling battle.\n\n\u201cThank you girls, for this amazing final. It was a great fight and I enjoyed every second,\u201d she said.\n\nThe win denied Barty in her bid for back-to-back U.S. Open doubles victories after claiming her maiden Grand Slam doubles title with CoCo Vandeweghe in New York last year.\n\n\u201cI thought the level was incredibly high,\u201d Barty said.\n\n\u201cIt was a great two weeks. I love playing with Ashleigh,\u201d Azarenka said.\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasure to play with her and I hope we can continue to play together in the future.\u201d\n\nMertens and Sabalenka, who are both accomplished singles players, said they see doubles growing in popularity as bigger names get involved.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n\u201cMore singles players are also playing doubles, more big names playing doubles,\u201d said Mertens, who reached the quarter-finals of the tournament in singles.\n\n\u201cBecause of the singles players playing doubles, the level going up and it\u2019s more interesting to watch,\u201d said Sabalenka, who was seeded ninth in singles.\n\n\u201cI think the level of doubles right now is a little bit higher than it was before.\u201d", "description": "Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka won their first career Grand Slam title with a hard-fought 7-5 7-5 win over Ash Barty and Victoria Azarenka in the U.S. Open doubles final on Sunday.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427806971&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8808Z", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
