If successful, the company will be profitable a year sooner than what analysts expected. Lyft\u2019s stock was up 5.16 per cent on the news in late afternoon trading, and rival Uber was up 3.50 per cent. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: Public markets have been ramping up pressure on recent unicorns to deliver profits.
