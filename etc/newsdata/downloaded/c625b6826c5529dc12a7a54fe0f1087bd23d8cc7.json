This is a lot of fun for the young guys.\u201d\n\nBrett Gardner and Didi Gregorius each homered twice, and Gleyber Torres and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n also went deep for the Yankees, whose 276 homers tied Minnesota for the major league lead.\n\n\u201cWhen a team hits six homers and gives you 11 runs, you have to win the game,\u201d Yankees opener Nelson Cortez Jr. said. \u201cWe let those guys down. There\u2019s no way around it.\u201d\n\nNew York, with a 95-51 record to Detroit\u2019s 43-100, led 6-0. But the Tigers tied the score with six runs in the third, aided by an error by Torres at second base.\n\nWith the Yankees ahead 6-2, Torres dropped a throw from Gregorius at shortstop on what appeared to be an inning-ending double play by Dawel Lugo off Luis Cessa, who had just replaced Cortes. Christin Stewart hit a sacrifice fly, Travis Demeritte added a RBI single and Greiner hit a two-run single.\n\nGreiner doubled with one out in the ninth off Chance Adams (1-1) and Mercer\u2019s single to the gap in right-center scored pinch-runner Willi Castro. Tigers closer Joe Jim\u00e9nez (3-8) pitched a perfect ninth.\n\n\u201cWilli can really run, so I knew I just had to get the ball in play for him,\u201d Mercer said. \u201cHe threw me a fastball and I just tried to put it in a gap.\u201d\n\nNew York built the lead off Edwin Jackson as Gardner had a solo homer in the first and hit a two-run drive to cap a five-run second that included Mike Ford\u2019s RBI single and Tyler Wade\u2019s two-run triple.\n\nSolo homers by Torres in the fourth and Gregorius in the fifth off Tyler Alexander put the Yankees ahead 8-6, but the Tigers burst to a 10-8 lead when Christin Stewart hit a solo homer off Cessa in the fifth, then Miguel Cabrera had a sacrifice fly against Cory Gearrin in the sixth and Jeimer Candelario followed with a two-run single.\n\nEncarnaci\u00f3n tied the score in the seventh off John Schreiber, and Gregorius homered off Daniel Stumpf for an 11-10 lead.\n\nMercer walked against Adam Ottavino in the bottom half, advanced on Gary S\u00e1nchez\u2019s seventh passed ball this season and scored on Harold Castro\u2019s single.\n\n\u201cHarold\u2019s been doing a great job - all these young guys have been - and we\u2019re having some fun,\u201d Mercer said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to match these other teams homer for homer, but we\u2019ll take a lot of singles if it leads to some wins.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: LHP Jordan Montgomery (Tommy John surgery) and RHP Dellin Betances (lat strain) both pitched for Double-A Trenton. Montgomery started and allowed two runs and two hits in three innings. Betances allowed one hit in a scoreless inning, striking out two. \u2026 RHP Tommy Kahnle has right wrist tendinitis and did not pitch, but Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he likely will be available on Wednesday.\n\nTigers: Castro didn\u2019t start because of a bruised forearm sustained when he was hit by a pitch on Saturday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees LHP CC Sabathia (5-8, 4.93) returns from his fourth trip to the IL this year to start Wednesday night. Sidelined by a chronically painful right knee, Sabathia last pitched on Aug. 30. LHP Matt Boyd (8-10, 4.57) starts for Detroit.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Playing the worst team in the major leagues, the New York Yankees took a six-run lead in the second inning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Hogg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/yankees_tigers_baseball_66914_c0-206-4939-3085_s1770x1032.jpg?8d3fcbeedcfd3298197f9cb1ce39b4d8fea8de51", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
