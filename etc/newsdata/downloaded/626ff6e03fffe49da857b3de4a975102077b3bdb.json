Timbers, Pavlovic and the show's music supervisors spent months getting the necessary permissions. Performers are pictured above in Warsaw, Poland\n\n'I want people to walk in and think: 'It's not like the Piccadilly any more,' Ms Pavlovic told me from her base in Sydney, where she's chief exec of Global Creatures, key lead producer of the production, based on the Oscar-winning 2001 Baz Luhrmann film.\n\nIt starred Nicole Kidman as chanteuse Satine, caught up in a love triangle involving songwriter Christian and sadistic aristocrat The Duke.\n\nKaren Olivo, Aaron Tveit and Tam Mutu, respectively, played those roles on Broadway. Ms Pavlovic said no casting decisions for London had been made yet.\n\nDirector Timbers told me the show will require someone with 'power and intensity' for the role of Satine.\n\nProducer Carmen Pavlovic said the musical, which has been playing to packed houses in New York, will open at the Piccadilly Theatre in 2021. The set is pictured above on Broadway\n\nHe also stressed that the production, written by John Logan with set design by Derek McLane and costumes by Catherine Zuber, is not about the Moulin Rouge that exists in the 18th Arrondissement.\n\n'This is the Moulin Rouge of your mind, so you want it to be as aspirational as possible.'\n\nProducer Carmen Pavlovic and the show's creative team, led by director Alex Timbers, above, transformed the Al Hirschfeld Theatre into Moulin's Broadway home\n\nMoulin Rouge! features 70 rock standards \u2014 many more than the film. Timbers, Pavlovic and the show's music supervisors spent months getting the necessary permissions.\n\n'There were 160-odd composers and 30 different publishers to negotiate with,' Pavlovic said.\n\nThe Rolling Stones wouldn't let Luhrmann use a song for his film, but Mick Jagger warmed to Timbers' plan for Gimme Shelter.\n\nHe also persuaded David Byrne to let them use Talking Heads' Burning Down The House.\n\n'It took a little bit of a journey to get there,' said Timbers, who directed Here Lies Love at the National Theatre, which had a score by Byrne.\n\nIt took Pavlovic several years to sign up all the rights from Luhrmann, co-writer Craig Pearce, 20th Century Fox \u2014 and the famous Paris venue that owns the name.\n\nTimbers told me that seeing Cats and Phantom Of The Opera when he was a kid inspired him to expand the show into the whole theatre.\n\nWhen I saw Moulin Rouge! for the second time I spent ten minutes at the end looking around.\n\nThere were windmills, big and small. The sails on the large one went round and round, which excited me beyond comprehension, because I felt like a kid again.\n\nRegister at moulinrougemusical.com to receive updates about tickets, which will go on sale next year.\n\n\n\nRos will beguile as Yelena\n\nRosalind Eleazar has been chosen by director Ian Rickman and producer Sonia Friedman to play Yelena, the married woman who beguiles her admirers in Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. Toby Jones takes the title role, with Richard Armitage as the doctor who sees Yelena as a goddess.\n\nThere has been a lot of buzz about the brilliant Ms Eleazar, left.
