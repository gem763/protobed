(AP) - Star receiver Antonio Brown returned to the Oakland Raiders on Friday after a one-day absence and is set to play the season opener after apologizing following a run-in with general manager Mike Mayock that had put him in jeopardy of being suspended.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be out here today,\u201d Brown said in a brief statement after practice. \u201cI want to apologize to my teammates, the organization. Enough talk now. I\u2019m excited to be out here with my teammates and grateful for all the fans and I\u2019m excited to be a part of the Raiders and see you guys soon.\u201d\n\nBrown addressed the team earlier in a meeting, a day after being sent home from the facility after a confrontation Wednesday at practice with Mayock. Brown had posted a letter earlier Wednesday from Mayock detailing nearly $54,000 in fines for missing a practice and walkthrough.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - The Kansas City Chiefs signed Tyreek Hill to a three-year, $54 million contract extension Friday, locking up the playmaking wide receiver whose off-the-field issues left his future in the NFL in question just a couple months ago.\n\nThe deal includes a $5.8 million signing bonus and $35.2 million in guarantees, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Chiefs do not disclose the terms of contracts.\n\n\u201cI hope he can still run that fast with all that money in his pocket,\u201d coach Andy Reid quipped after Friday\u2019s walk-through ahead of the Chiefs\u2019 opener Sunday in Jacksonville.\n\nThe length of the deal protects the Chiefs from investing too heavily in a dynamic player with a checkered past while also giving the 25-year-old Hill the chance for another payday down the road.\n\n-By AP Sports Writer Dave Skretta.\n\nTENNIS\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Rafael Nadal moved closer to his fourth U.S. Open title and 19th from all Grand Slam tournaments by pulling away for a 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-1 semifinal victory over 24th-seeded Matteo Berrettini of Italy.\n\nNadal trailed 4-0 and 6-4 in the opening-set tiebreaker but took the last four points.\n\nOne service break was all the second-seeded Nadal would need in the second set before he dominated the third. He never faced a break point in the entire match.\n\nThe 33-year-old Spaniard will face No. 5 seed Daniil Medvedev on Sunday.\n\nIt is Medvedev\u2019s first major final.\n\nIf Nadal wins, he will pull within one of Roger Federer\u2019s men\u2019s record of 20 Grand Slam trophies.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Major League Baseball and the players\u2019 association will discuss the possibility of more widespread testing for opioids following the death of Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs.\n\nSkaggs was found dead in his hotel room in the Dallas area July 1 before the start of a series against the Texas Rangers. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said the 27-year-old died after choking on his vomit with a toxic mix of alcohol and the painkillers fentanyl and oxycodone in his body.\n\nA toxicology report said his blood alcohol concentration was 0.122%, well above Texas\u2019s alcohol limit of 0.08% for driving, and 3.8 nanograms per milliliter of fentanyl.\n\nPlayers on 40-man rosters are tested for drugs of abuse such as opioids only if the player-management joint treatment board finds reasonable cause, if a player has been found to have used or possessed a drug of abuse, or if a player is subjected to testing under a treatment program. All players on 40-man rosters are subject to testing for banned performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids and for banned stimulants.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) - Vlade Divac led off the festivities at the Basketball Hall of Fame\u2019s 2019 enshrinement ceremonies.\n\nThe Yugoslav and Los Angeles Lakers star was the first to be inducted on Friday night at Springfield\u2019s Symphony Hall. He would be joined later by Jack Sikma, Sidney Moncrief, Paul Westphal, Bobby Jones, Al Attles and Teresa Weatherspoon.\n\nChuck Cooper and Carl Braun were inducted posthumously and Bill Fitch was unable to attend for health reasons.\n\nSOCCER\n\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) - Caster Semenya has signed for a South African soccer club and may be considering giving up track and field.\n\nThe Olympic 800-meter champion, who is currently in a legal battle with the IAAF over her right to compete without taking testosterone-suppressing medication, says she has joined women\u2019s club JVW FC.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based club says Semenya is training with the team but will only play league games in 2020. Next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics are in July and August, when the women\u2019s soccer season in South Africa will be in action.\n\nSemenya is barred from defending her 800 title at this month\u2019s world championships after refusing to follow IAAF rules requiring her to reduce her natural testosterone. She is appealing against those rules at the Swiss supreme court.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nThe NHL for the first time selected four female officials to work on the ice at prospect tournaments held this weekend.\n\nKatie Guay and Kelly Cooke were selected as referees, while Kirsten Welsh and Kendall Hanley will work as linesmen, the league announced Friday.\n\nThe four were selected out of a group of 96 officials, including 11 women, who participated in the league\u2019s annual officials exposure combine last month in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time women have officiated at the pre-training camp prospects tournament level. It\u2019s the next step in the league\u2019s bid to have women officiate at the NHL level.\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman previously said he envisions a woman officiating at the league level, without providing a timeline.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Joe Thornton is coming back for another season at age 40, signing a one-year, $2 million contract with the San Jose Sharks on Friday after briefly contemplating retirement at the end of last season.\n\nThornton decided in the offseason that he wasn\u2019t ready to hang it up after 21 seasons in the NHL, saying he\u2019d only play in San Jose. The Sharks were eager to bring Thornton back, but it took until a week before training camp for the finalized contract.\n\nThornton arrived in San Jose in a franchise-altering trade from Boston on Nov. 30, 2005, turning the Sharks into a perennial Cup contender that can never quite win it all.\n\nCOURTS\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - A New Orleans Saints fan\u2019s lawsuit against the NFL and game officials over the failure to call a crucial penalty against the Los Angeles Rams in a January playoff game was dismissed Friday by the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling appeared to be a death blow to the last remaining lawsuit over what\u2019s come to be known as the \u201cNOLA No-Call.\u201d It also means that, barring a reversal, Commissioner Roger Goodell and game officials will not have to be questioned under oath in New Orleans, as a lower court had previously ordered.\n\nThere were no dissents among the seven court members in the reversal of the lower court\u2019s ruling.\n\nAttorney Antonio LeMon had sued, alleging fraud and seeking damages over game officials\u2019 failure to flag a blatant penalty: a Rams player\u2019s helmet-to-helmet hit on a Saints receiver with a pass on the way. The lack of a penalty call for pass interference or roughness helped the Rams beat the Saints and advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nOBITUARY\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - Chris Duncan, the former outfielder who helped the St. Louis Cardinals win the 2006 World Series, died Friday. He was 38.\n\nDuncan, the son of former St. Louis pitching coach Dave Duncan and brother of former major leaguer Shelley Duncan, died of brain cancer in his hometown of Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\u201cThe Cardinals are deeply saddened by the passing of Chris Duncan and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Amy, the entire Duncan family, and his many friends,\u201d Cardinals Chairman and CEO Bill DeWitt Jr. said in a statement. \u201cChris was an integral part of our 2006 championship team and a great teammate and friend to many in the organization.\u201d\n\nDuncan hit .257 with 55 home runs and 175 RBIs in 381 games in five seasons with the Cardinals.\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - Chester Williams, the only black player on South Africa\u2019s famed 1995 Rugby World Cup winning team, died on Friday of a heart attack. He was 49.\n\nSA Rugby announced Williams\u2019 death and said he died in Cape Town, where he had been coaching a university team.\n\nWilliams became one of the faces of the new South Africa when the Springboks won the World Cup on home soil in front of Nelson Mandela. It was just a year after apartheid officially ended and South Africa elected Mandela as president in its first all-race elections.\n\nWilliams\u2019 presence in the Springboks team, which had been all-white for years during the apartheid regime, underlined South Africa\u2019s transformation.\n\nLAHORE, Pakistan (AP) - Abdul Qadir, the former Pakistan cricketer who was widely regarded as one of the greatest legspinners in history, died of a cardiac arrest on Friday.
