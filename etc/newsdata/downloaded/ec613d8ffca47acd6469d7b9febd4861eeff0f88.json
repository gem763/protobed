LaVorgna (@Lavorgnanomics) September 26, 2019\n\nAsked for more details, LaVorgna on Thursday told MarketWatch that he thought some firms may have been caught on the wrong side of the \u201cmassive, violent sell-off\u201d in the bond market earlier this month. Shadow banking refers to a range of non-bank credit-market participants, including hedge funds.\n\n\u201cThere was a massive dislocation in the markets\u201d this month if you look at momentum trading, said LaVorgna, who began his career at the New York Fed. In addition to a selloff that sent Treasury yields higher, a heavy rotation out of previously favored growth and momentum stocks in to value was also thought to have caused pain for traders.\n\nBorrowers, including banks, securities firms and hedge funds, use the repo market to borrow cash over the short term in return for collateral, including securities such as U.S. Treasurys.\n\nLast week, overnight repurchasing rates soared to three times their usual rate, pushing the effective fed funds rate briefly beyond its target range. This lending rate reflects how much investors and banks have to pay to borrow cash over a short period, in return for highly rated collateral like Treasurys.\n\nThe pressure in a key part of the U.S. financial system\u2019s plumbing forced the New York Fed to step in on Sept. 17 and begin offering daily overnight repo operations. In its operations, the Fed lends funds in return for collateral with a small group of banks or securities dealers known as primary dealers, who, in turn, work as intermediaries between the Fed and other investors. The volatility sparked a search for explanations and prompted criticism of the New York Fed\u2019s handling of the market.\n\nWhen the market moves that violently there are always some entities that are caught offside, LaVorgna said, speculating that it\u2019s possible \u201csomeone got caught on a trade and had to liquidate.\u201d If so, the identities of those firms might become known after the end of the quarter, he said.\n\nLaVorgna said he didn\u2019t think the turmoil was tied to problems with the banking sector because the fed funds rate, which is the rate at which banks provide overnight loans to each other, didn\u2019t spike.\n\nAnalysts have been divided about the root causes of the market turmoil. Some blame the Federal Reserve for being slow to react and letting its balance sheet shrink too far as its bond buying program begun after the 2008 financial crisis was slowly unwound . Critics said the Fed should have been aware that factors cited for the funding squeeze, including quarterly tax payments and Treasury auction settlements, could cause dislocations.\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams said his bank was investigating the recent market dynamics. The New York Fed has said it would continue to offer daily repo operations of at least $75 billion through Oct. 10 and has instituted other measures.\n\nMarket participants say the moves have brought some measure of calm back to the market.\n\n\u201cIn the short-term, the Fed has worked it out. But there will need to be a longer-term solution. Increasing the balance sheet is one,\u201d said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nIn a Thursday blog post, Brian Sack of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, and Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said one way to prevent another seizure in funding markets would be for the central bank to expand its portfolio of securities by $250 billion over the next two quarters. Sack is a former head of the New York Fed\u2019s Markets Group, while Gagnon is a former Fed official.\n\nThey also urged the Fed to implement a standing fixed-rate repo facility and said the Fed should be explicit in its desire to control the repo rate rather than prioritizing the fed funds rate. They said the Fed should consider targeting the repo rate instead of the fed funds rate when setting policy.\n\nOthers have pointed the finger at post-crisis regulations stipulating banks carry ample reserves which in turn constrained their ability to lend out short-term funds to money markets and bring down overnight borrowing costs when they got out of hand.\n\nUnder those rules, U.S. lenders with more than $250 billion of assets have to keep highly liquid assets on their balance sheet in order to deal with cash outflows.\n\n\u201cIn another time, this type of dislocation would have been something banks could have arbitraged away,\u201d said Dave Leduc, head of Mellon\u2019s actively managed fixed-income arm.\n\n\u201cBanks were unable to get involved to provide liquidity,\u201d Leduc noted. \u201cHas there been some unintended consequences in that the stricter regulatory environment where it\u2019s creating dislocation problems in the market?\u201d asked Leduc.\n\nUltimately, LaVorgna said he didn\u2019t think the Fed bank was to blame.\n\nInstead, he said it\u2019s more likely to a \u201cmicro architectural\u201d problem with the financial system. \u201cThere are some clogs in the financial plumbing,\u201d he said. It is hard to know who is feeling pain now because the Fed\u2019s daily moves to add liquidity to the system has the effect of masking where the problem lies, he said.", "description": "The trouble in the financial system\u2019s plumbing might be due to trouble in the shadow banking sector, says economist Joe LaVorgna.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Sunny Oh", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS144_fed_ne_ZG_20190926121053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
