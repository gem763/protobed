Demers said on Monday that Peng\u2019s arrest \u201cexposes and disrupts an operation\u201d by Chinese intelligence officers to harvest classified material without setting foot on U.S. soil.\n\n\u201cComing on top of our many recent Chinese espionage cases \u2013 involving both national defense and intellectual property information \u2013 this case illustrates the seriousness of Chinese espionage efforts and the determination of the United States to thwart them,\u201d said Demers.\n\nAccording to the unsealed charges, Peng used \u201cdead drops\u201d to obtain secure digital cards stuffed with classified information and personally delivered the cards to Chinese intelligence agents in Beijing. He obtained the classified data from an unnamed \u201cconfidential human source\u201d who was paid for his or her efforts by Peng.\n\nPeng allegedly tested his espionage system with a dry run in June 2015, picking up an empty package left by his source at the front desk of a hotel, before making at least five live dead drops using the hotel strategy. In each case, Peng booked a hotel room, passed a room key along to the source, and left an envelope with $10,000 or $20,000 in the room as payment. The source took the money and left an SD card full of stolen data tucked inside a book or taped to the inside of a drawer, which Peng collected and delivered to Beijing.\n\nThe indictment stated that Peng was under the control of Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) agents during these activities, which ran from October 2015 to June 2018. According to the indictment, Peng\u2019s source for classified info was in fact a \u201cdouble agent,\u201d his dead drops were captured with hidden cameras, and his communications with the MSS were intercepted.\n\nCBS News reported on Monday that Peng came to the U.S. on a business visa in 2001, got married and became a legal permanent resident in 2006, and was naturalized in 2012. He ostensibly worked as a tour guide for Chinese visitors who wanted to see San Francisco. The Justice Department described him as a trained Chinese intelligence agent. If he is convicted, the charges against him could carry up to 10 years in prison plus $250,000 in fines.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are the number one intelligence threat to the United States right now. No question. The Russians are up there for sure, but the Chinese are number one,\u201d Demers told NBC News in an interview on Monday.\n\nDemers told NBC the FBI allowed Peng to keep making his dead drops for years so they could study Chinese spycraft and track the progress of the \u201ccarefully curated\u201d data the source passed along to the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\n\nHe said the Justice Department wanted Peng\u2019s arrest to \u201csend a message to anyone else who may be acting in this capacity on behalf of the Chinese government\u201d that \u201cyou could get caught\u201d and Chinese intelligence is putting their lives at risk.", "description": "The Justice Department on Monday announced espionage charges against a California resident for spying on behalf of China.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178182801-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
