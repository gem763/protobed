Don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t heard it before. Jordan Stump, the translator of this French novel explains \u201cCheffe is a recently minted word in French; its meaning, of course, is \u201cfemale chef.\u201d Because no good English equivalent exists, this translation will use the French word.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the subtitle \u201cA Cook\u2019s Novel.\u201d It could mean a novel for a cook, or a novel by a cook, or a novel about a cook. It\u2019s a translation of the French subtitle roman d\u2019une cuisiniere, which has a similar range of meanings.\n\nThis novel is definitely about a female cook, the Cheffe of the title and always referred to by that term. The narrator \u2014 the fictional author \u2014 was, also a cook, an apprentice to the Cheffe, who fell in love with her and became, he says, her only confidant.\n\nHe presents an entirely laudatory account of her. As he explains \u201cI\u2019d like to tell the Life of the Cheffe the way people write the Life of a Saint, but that\u2019s impossible, and the Cheffe herself would have thought it ridiculous.\u201d But just as hagiographers have no concern for shortcomings, so our narrator is all adulation.\n\nHis first pages extol her intelligence, apparently doubted by some who knew her. When asked the \u201cquestion you\u2019re thinking of\u201d \u2014 presumably how she\u2019d gained her \u201cglorious reputation \u2026 without really trying\u201d \u2014 she replies by shrugging her shoulders \u201cIt\u2019d not hard, you just have to be organized.\u201d When pushed, she amplifies \u201cIt just takes a little taste.\u201d\n\nAccording to the narrator she had not only taste and organizational skills but also intelligence teamed with industriousness, fastidiousness, devotion, modesty and many more saintly qualities. Pages and pages of them. Again and again the narrator writes of her austerity and her devotion to her art.\n\n\u201cShe had no taste for preciousness or grandiloquence, and no respect. She knew all about the force of the senses, after all it was her work to awaken them, and she was always enchanted to see that force show on the diners\u2019 faces, she strove for nothing else, day in and day out, for so many years, virtually without rest. But the words people used to describe it struck her as indecent.\u201d\n\nDetails of her history are woven into the panegyric. She was born in a very poor but not pathetic family, and that, according to the narrator, underpinned her distaste for praise. She learned to cook as a kitchen maid watching the household\u2019s slipshod cook and fantasizing about what wonderful dishes would emerge were the work done properly.\n\nShe learned also from the talented chef of the Bordeaux restaurant where she worked, never understanding how such an obnoxious man could be such as good cook because to her good cooking and fine character were a continuum. She had a daughter, but like much else, the identity of the father is shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn every saint\u2019s story there is a devil, and in \u201cThe Cheffe\u201d it is the daughter: An \u201cunpleasant, sterile woman, arrogant and vain.\u201d As the novel progresses this daughter plays a larger and ever more destructive part. If any reader ever suspects that our narrator is unreliable, his attitude to the daughter will confirm it.\n\nHe has retired from his work as a chef, and spends his time in the Catalonian resort of Lloret de Mar, hanging with a pleasant boozy crowd, dreading the threatened appearance of his own daughter.\n\nThe twinned narrative threads of the Cheffe\u2019s and the narrator\u2019s lives are conventional enough \u2014 scarcely the substance of a compelling novel. Yet this novel is just that: Compelling in its prolonged insistence on the Cheffe\u2019s character and the determined vigor of the narrator\u2019s delineations.\n\nThe slow-moving narrative and repetitive descriptions couched in long reflective sentences give the novel an hypnotic quality. It\u2019s irritating too. Together these two responses make for an emotional engagement likely to be lacking had the tale been told more conventionally.\n\nAlso lacking is much information about what the Cheffe cooked. Her dishes are noted only briefly. The exception is her green-robed leg of lamb, often mentioned but only described near the end. Rooted in her wish \u201cto taste the exquisite Paulliac lamb and Belleville sorrel in their most highest form, refusing to hide the sorrel\u2019s roughness behind cream and butter.\n\n\u201cTo that she added spinach, she liked a trinity of ingredients, then slow-braised the lamb in its wrapping of bitter greens so the meat\u2019s fatty juices mellowed the sorrel and the lamb turned out at once triumphantly tender and so strongly flavored that the contrast \u2014 a young dark-tasting meat disconcerted the eater\u2019s first mouthfuls.\u201d\n\nCooks hoping that the subtitle referred to them as well as to the Cheffe and her narrator must satisfy themselves with this.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE CHEFFE: A COOK\u2019S NOVEL\n\nBy Marie Ndiaye\n\nTranslated by Jordan Stump\n\nAlfred A Knopf, $26.95, 304 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
