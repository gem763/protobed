What exactly can they say?\u2019 Reid wrote.\n\n\u2018At ITV, we\u2019re bound by the same broadcasting impartiality rules.\n\nReid presented BBC Breakfast for 10 years before switching to ITV (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n\u2018I would never want anyone to be able to tell which way I vote, but we\u2019re encouraged to share our opinions and experiences and viewers love it.\u2019\n\nReid said that that openness to expressing opinions on the air was \u2018especially important when, like Naga, a presenter has a personal story that\u2019s truly relevant to the news.\n\n\u2018Otherwise, what are we there for?\u2019\n\nReid\u2019s GMB co-host Piers Morgan also publicly defended Munchetty this week, before slamming the \u2018sinister\u2019 Editorial Standards department at the BBC.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
