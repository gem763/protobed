These are all government interventions that disrupt the operation of the market, often with unintended consequences.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Australian governments created the National Electricity Market (NEM) and established market agencies to deliver reliable, affordable power. Many of the expected benefits of this market have been delivered. Like any other tool, markets need to be maintained to make sure they still work well. It is here that governments, their agencies and the industry have failed.\n\nMisguided\n\nGovernments, particularly the federal government, appear to have formed a view that the market is not functioning, and that intervention is necessary. Far from simply setting the rules and appointing the referees, the federal government has become one of the key players in the electricity market game.\n\nBut many of these interventions will be ineffective at best, and counterproductive at worst. By picking winners and directly supporting specific generation investments, governments crowd out other investments. When governments wield a \u2018big stick\u2019 and pressure companies over coal closures, it makes it harder for the market to deliver the price and reliability outcomes politicians and consumers want.\n\nOur report makes four recommendations based on a central principle: governments should be committed to an effective and efficient NEM and intervention, when needed, should be rules-based and through existing institutions.\n\nFirst, governments have initiated the post-2025 NEM review to ensure the market remains fit for purpose and delivers enough dispatchable capacity. They should not second-guess that review through separate, conflicting interventions. However, they should similarly review the roles of the market agencies, particularly that of the Energy Security Board whose current mandate ends next year.\n\nWe have identified two key areas where well-structured government intervention is justified. The current process to deliver much-needed investment in transmission links takes far too long, as much as six or seven years. This should be accelerated by running some of the processes in parallel and giving networks confidence they can recover the cost of early planning works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManaging closure\n\nManaging the closure of ageing coal power generators is critical to a successful energy transition. Consumers cannot afford another sudden closure as occurred with the Hazelwood power station in 2017. But existing rules to prevent this are likely to be ineffective. We propose that coal generators be required to put funds into escrow to ensure they comply with closure dates that they nominate in advance, to protect consumers and drive timely replacement investment.\n\nFourth, governments must fix up the climate policy mess. The federal government has considered and rejected five climate policies over the past decade, and state governments have filled the vacuum with uncoordinated renewable energy targets. If the federal government is unwilling to provide clarity, the states should do so through a state-based, but nationally-consistent, emissions reduction policy.\n\nA well-designed and well-regulated electricity market will deliver low emissions and reliable supply at lowest cost. Direct, ad-hoc government intervention will lead to higher prices and lower reliability. If government actions are rules-based and implemented through sound institutions, all Australians will share the benefits.\n\nTony Wood is director of the energy program at the Grattan Institute.", "description": "Every ad hoc solution that governments pile on the energy market is making it harder to deliver the price and security outcomes that politicians and customers want.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c17f201ddfc3b42e271c81570599e09349ec5cc3", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
