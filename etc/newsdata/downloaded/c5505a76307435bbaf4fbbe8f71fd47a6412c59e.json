Ben McAdams on Wednesday in West Jordan, Utah\n\nThe survey comes as the impeachment battle rises to a fever pitch, after the White House vowed not to cooperate with House Democrats who accuse Trump of asking a foreign government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe poll found that 43% agreed that Trump's remarks on a July phone call with the president of Ukraine were and impeachable offense, while 27% believed that they were inappropriate but not impeachable. Only 17% said the remarks were appropriate.\n\nThe survey of 1,003 registered voters was conducted by phone between October 6 and 8.\n\nOn Wednesday, experts said the White House's refusal to cooperate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's impeachment inquiry has teed up a constitutional clash that will likely leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide whether to compel compliance.\n\nThe confrontation \u2013 which has only grown more volatile since the release of a whistle-blower's report last month \u2013 could very well be on a path akin to United States vs. Nixon \u2013 with a series of major and minor figures facing ratcheting pressure of legal fees, not to mention fines and jail \u2013 as the branches sort out conflicts.\n\nThe stand-off became even more immediate when the White House counsel's office released a blistering letter essentially daring House Democrats to sue, and vowing the White House 'cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.'\n\nWhite House's refuses to cooperate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's impeachment inquiry\n\n'The moment of crisis is already upon is. We've got a president of the United States saying against the clear meaning of the Constitution and 230 years precedent he's going to plainly defy orders,' said Frank O. Bowman III, who teaches law at the University of Missouri and wrote a book on impeachment in the age of Trump.\n\nThings will only pick up if the House directs its counsel to take the matter to the courts to compel the production of documents.\n\nThat could immediately put the squeeze on lower-level officials as well as cabinet members who are in possession of documents House Democrats deem essential to their inquiry.\n\nDepending on how the Trump administration responds, individuals may have to choose between court orders and what their administration bosses are saying.\n\nU.S. ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland said through his attorney that he wants to testify and flew in from Brussels to do so Tuesday, but has been directed not to participate by the White House. He has turned over information to Mike Pompeo's State Department, but may also maintain personal possession of materials of interest.\n\nHouse Democrats are mindful of dangers posed by a long slog through the courts.\n\nBut on a related matter \u2013 the Manhattan DA's investigation of the Stormy Daniels payoff and other matters \u2013 the 2nd Circuit scheduled a quick hearing after Trump's lawyers appealed a blistering lower-court ruling.\n\n'I think that things are definitely heating up and I think it's fair to call this approaching a constitutional crisis,' said Susan Low Bloch, who teaches constitutional law at Georgetown University Law School.\n\n'It's not yet because nobody has defied [an order]. So far there's no defiance \u2013 there's standing on principle and \"I'm not going to do this,\"' she said.\n\nThe Trump White House made clear its defiant stance in a legal letter that eschewed legalize in favor of bashing Schiff and the 'partisan rush to judgement.'\n\nThe matter could easily be headed to the Supreme Court, prompting Democrats to fear GOP foot-dragging might run out the clock.\n\nPelosi in recent comments has called for moving swiftly, and focusing on Ukraine even as fellow Democrats push to consider pursuing impeachment based on alleged obstruction, self-dealing, and other matters.\n\nWhichever avenue they take, Democrats are on firm constitutional ground as far as their impeachment power, say legal scholars.\n\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution states that: 'The House of Representatives...shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.' The Constitution also grants each chamber the power to 'determine the rules of its proceedings.'\n\nThe lack of firm instructions on how to actually carry out an impeachment has opened the way for Trump to launch a focused attack on Pelosi's move.\n\nIn addition to blasting the inquiry itself, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone attacked the process itself, calling for the minority be given the right to have lawyers present and issue its own subpoenas.", "description": "The poll released on Wednesday found that 51% agreed that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, a nine-point jump from the most recent survey on July 19.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith", "Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/02/19519928-0-image-a-9_1570670407228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
