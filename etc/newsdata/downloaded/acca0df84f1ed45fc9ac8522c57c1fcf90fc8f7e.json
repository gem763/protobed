They became concerned and called the police and ambulance. They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\n\"My parents were already there. Then this person must have called again and the ambulance turned up at around 4pm and we had a quick chat on the doorstep. He said it was a lovely house.\n\n\"I wasn't speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn't answering the phone. I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures.\"\n\nArg added: \u201cThe police and paramedics were only here for about ten minutes. I'm slightly embarrassed really. I apologise for any wasted police time as I was absolutely fine.\"\n\nIn a statement, Metropolitan Police said: \"Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant. Officers attended with LAS [London Ambulance Service]. The male, in his 30s, was spoken to. He was left in the company of family.\n\n\"Officers were called at 16.21hrs to the same address, again due to concerns for the same male's welfare. The male declined assistance.\"", "description": "The former TOWIE star was visited at home by paramedics last week after he failed to answer calls for 12 hours", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Splashnews.Com", "Google Maps", "Instagram", "Supplied Wenn"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663607.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_James-Arg-Argent-Leaves-Gemma-Collins-Apartment-In-Essex-After-Coming-Round-To-Support-Her-After.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
