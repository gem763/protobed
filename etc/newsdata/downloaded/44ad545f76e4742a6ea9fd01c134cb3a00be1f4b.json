When you see players like him you can say maybe in the future he can become a manager, and he\u2019s here with us!\n\n'It\u2019s a bit weird he is my boss now, but I am very happy to work with him again. He has given me the confidence to play. He wants me to be happy. A part of the performances I have had in the past couple of games I have to dedicate to him.\n\nThe Brazilian played alongside the Blues legend (centre) 26 times during the 13/14 season\n\n'He always says to me \"I want you to be happy\". That\u2019s why I have been playing like I have been.'\n\nWillian has been an important figure in Chelsea's form. He has scored once and assisted once in the Premier League and notched an important winner against Lille in the Champions League.\n\n\u2018I think our style of play has helped me, but not only that. The freedom he gives to us is important as well. I don\u2019t have to stay on the right side. I can move around, I can move between the lines, I can move to the left side as well.\n\nWillian of Chelsea scores his sides second goal during the Champions League match at Lille\n\n\u2018I feel good playing in this way and that\u2019s why I have been playing better and better. I hope to continue like this,' Willian added.\n\nUnder Jose Mourinho the pair finished third in the league, reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup and the fifth round of the FA Cup.\n\nThey lost the final of the UEFA Super Cup on penalties to Bayern and were seen off by Atletico in the semis of the Champions League.", "description": "The Brazilian played alongside the Blues legend 26 times during the 13/14 season, Lampard's last as a Chelsea player.
