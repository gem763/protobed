We take out far too many fish and shellfish, often catching them in destructive ways that have devastating impacts on other wildlife, and we use the seas as a dumping ground for an insidious tide of plastic waste and all sorts of other pollution.\n\n\u201cAdd to that threats from rising sea temperatures, oil and gas exploration and extraction, and coastal development, and it\u2019s not really surprising that we are losing our marine wildlife like never before.\u201d\n\nThe awards also include junior categories to encourage young people to connect with nature through photography.\n\nAn exhibition tour launches on Tuesday and will run throughout the UK until July next year.\n\nSWNS", "description": "A plaice with a face only a mother could love along with a slumbering hedgehog and Narnia-like fields blanketed in snow are among the images showcased in this year's British Wildlife Photography Awards.", "authors": ["Laura Sharman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/12/british-wildlife-photography-awards-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
