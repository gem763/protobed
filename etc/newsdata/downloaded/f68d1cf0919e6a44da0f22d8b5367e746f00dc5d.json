Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nBut analysts say the suggestion that Mr Erdogan, a head of state of a G20 country, could meet and negotiate with the head of an organisation Turkey considers a terrorist organisation would have been the most insulting dimension of the letter.\n\nIn the letter, Mr Trump told Mr Erdogan he could make a \u201cgreat deal\u201d with General Mazloum Kobani, leader of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), the Kurdish-led militia that is allied with Washington in the fight against Isis.\n\nPutting the YPG and Turkey on an equal footing would be unacceptable, say several analysts familiar with Ankara\u2019s thinking, akin to suggesting Osama bin Laden would sit down with George W. Bush.\n\nA presenter at pro-government CNN Turk described the letter as \u201cweird and far from diplomatic.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Few believe Mr Pence has much of an understanding of what is happening in Syria. Mr Pompeo has a grasp of both the dynamics inside Syria and Turkish politics, but has a single-minded focus on Iran that has repeatedly coloured his regional approach.\n\nTurkish mistrust of Washington remains high, especially over a series of unfulfilled promises that include commitments to keep YPG forces east of the Euphrates River in Syria, hand over lists of weapons to the YPG, and halt the growing influence of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the Turkish branch of the Kurdish separatist group, inside northeast Syria.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s vow, in his letter, to damage the Turkish economy if it did not meet his vague demands, also underscores the atmosphere of growing hostility between the two Nato allies.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of civilians, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a military operation to take control of a huge swath of northeast Syria just hours after angrily reading and tossing out a now-infamous, rambling letter by US President Donald Trump urging him not to do so, local media cited official sources as saying.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/19/syria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
