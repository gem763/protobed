The once mighty caliphate has all but crumbled, and thousands of his fighters have been killed or languish in jail cells.\n\nSince the collapse of the caliphate earlier this year, Western intelligence agencies had speculated that Baghdadi had gone into hiding somewhere in the desert regions of Iraq or Syria. Despite being the most wanted terrorist in the world, he still managed to release occasional audio and video messages to Isis supporters.\n\nBaghdadi has been rumoured to have been killed a number of times. In 2017, Russia said it was investigating whether one of its airstrikes on the city of Raqqa killed him and 300 other fighters. Other reports suggested he had been incapacitated by a US-led coalition strike.\n\nThis time, though, the reports appear to be more concrete. Witnesses and videos posted online give an account of gunfire and helicopters near the town of Barisha, just 5 miles from the Turkish border, around midnight.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syria war monitor, reported an attack carried out by a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by a warplane, in the Barisha area north of Idlib city, after midnight on Saturday, adding that Isis operatives were believed to be hiding in the area.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Britain-based Observatory, which operates through a network of activists on the ground, documented the death of 9 people as a result of the coalition helicopter attack.\n\nIn the hours after the raid, there were conflicting reports about who and what information paved the way for the operation.\n\nIraq's intelligence service said it had provided the US-led anti-Isis coalition with the exact coordinates of Baghdadi's location, paving the way for the raid that reportedly killed him.\n\nThe agency learned of Baghdadi's location from documents found at a secret location in Iraq's western desert after arresting an Iraqi man and woman from within his \"inner circle\", an Iraqi intelligence official told Reuters.\n\n\"We have been constantly coordinating with the CIA, providing valuable information that the Iraqi National Intelligence Service has on Baghdadi's movements and place of hiding,\" the official said.\n\nA senior Turkish official, in a statement to journalists, said Baghdadi had arrived in the location 48 hours before the raid took place.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish military did have advance knowledge of last night\u2019s raid. We will continue to coordinate our actions on the ground,\u201d they said.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s alleged death comes at a time when many feared Isis was on the verge of a resurgence. A military operation by Turkey against Kurdish forces in the northeast has caused mass displacement and chaos, and led to a reduction in anti-Isis operations.\n\nDozens of Isis prisoners were thought to have escaped from jails held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the chaos of the attack.\n\n\u2014 With agencies", "description": "Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has reportedly been killed by a US military raid in northern Syria.\u00a0 Officials from several countries said US special forces carried out an attack targeting\u00a0the terror chief\u00a0in the northern province of Idlib late on Saturday, but confirmation of his death is still pending.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/01/02/Baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
