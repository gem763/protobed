The projected recovery time for the two-time All-Star outfielder is eight-to-10 weeks, and doctors say surgery is not necessary.\n\n\u201cI think the hardest part of the whole thing was the unknown for about 24 hours,\u201d Yelich said Monday in his first public comments since the injury. \u201cIt was a broad spectrum of outcomes and recovery times, depending on what the MRI showed. We got the good news of no surgery. Once I knew that, it was just about getting better and trying to make a full recovery.\u201d\n\nYelich said it will be difficult to miss playing in the postseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve broken anything in my life or had a real injury,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cIt seems to be one of those things that\u2019s not fair at the moment. Trust me, I had my pity party that night at the stadium and I felt terrible. \u2026 Trust me, I wish I could have an impact on this race or if we make the playoff, participate in that. But it\u2019s not going to happen. So there\u2019s no point in dwelling on it or letting it get you down.\u201d\n\nYelich hit .329 with 44 homers, 97 RBIs and 30 stolen bases for the Brewers, who reached Game 7 of last year\u2019s NL Championship Series before losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, we seem to pull it together in September, and when everything is on the line, we find a way to win,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Yelich said he had a \"pity party\" for himself after fracturing his right kneecap.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles F.
