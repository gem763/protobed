Outside, the ocean surged, swallowing the land.\n\nBrent Lowe knew he had to escape \u2014 and take his 24-year-old son, who has cerebral palsy and cannot walk, with him.\n\nBut he had another problem: he is blind.\n\nMr Lowe put his grown son on his shoulders, then stepped off his porch. The swirling current outside came up to his chin.\n\n\u201cIt was scary, so scary,\u201d he said.\n\nClutching neighbours, he said he felt his way to the closest home still standing. It was five minutes \u2014 an eternity \u2014 away.\n\nStories of unlikely survival have slowly emerged in the days since Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas, pummelling the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco for days before moving towards the Atlantic Seaboard.\n\nWhile the damage has been visible from above, the full human toll is still far from certain, with 30 deaths confirmed so far and authorities warning that the real number may be much higher.\n\nThe death count \u201ccould be staggering,\u201d Dr Duane Sands, the minister of health, who updated the toll late Thursday.\n\nSome neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble, almost entirely flattened by the storm. In others, 95 per cent of homes have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThousands of people are now homeless, taking refuge in gyms or churches, and authorities are bracing for an influx of bodies as the extent of the destruction becomes clear.\n\nWhen Hurricane Dorian first made landfall on Sunday, Mr Lowe recalled, all of its fury seemed to bear down on him.\n\nThe storm raging outside was one of the most powerful ever to sweep through the Atlantic. Its eye was approaching, and the group of eight people inside Mr Lowe\u2019s cement house were particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn addition to Lowe and his disabled son, neighbours whose homes had already been destroyed were also sheltering there. Among them were two children.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6082822785001\n\nHurricane Dorian pounds relentlessly at Bahamas\n\nAs the storm howled around them, he said the roof began to lift off, then slap back down.\n\nAbaco withstood sustained winds of up to 185mph that day, with gusts that reached 220mph.\n\nThe group sought safety in the bathroom, where they huddled together and prayed, hoping for relief. Mr Lowe\u2019s son was nestled inside the bathtub.\n\nThat is when the roof flew away.\n\nExposed to the elements, each person had to step out into the storm. They clung to each other and set out to find refuge.\n\nRead more\n\nMillions ordered to evacuate as Dorian bears down on US\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like that in my life,\u201d said M Lowe, who is no stranger to hurricanes but said he could never have imagined the terror of that day.\n\nThe group reached a neighbour's house. Mr Lowe and his son hunkered down there for a day until a rescue bus was able to pick them up on Monday and take them to a shelter.\n\nOn Tuesday night, he was evacuated to Nassau, where he can get the dialysis treatment he needs three times a week. His son had to stay in Abaco, in the care of Mr Lowe\u2019s sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cI came here with the clothes that I had on from Saturday,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the father and son are now safe, his ordeal is, in some ways, only beginning.\n\nHe did not know if his eldest daughter made it through the storm. The phone lines have been down for days and communication with Abaco is very difficult.", "description": "The roof had blown clean off.
