Maybe it\u2019s hiding the greys in your hair by going peroxide blond. Maybe it\u2019s getting a massive Black Flag tattoo on your belly. For me, it was doing something that I waited almost 30 years to commit to, an idea rooted in the kind of outdated rebellion that I probably picked up from a George Michael music video \u2013 it was getting my ears pierced.\n\nI wasn\u2019t allowed to get my ears pierced until I turned 13, at which point I decided that it wasn\u2019t cool any more (or at least that was the story I was sticking to \u2013 my dad had his ear pierced, so it didn\u2019t hold big rebel energy for me anyway). It was only last year at the age of 29 that I decided it was time to take the plunge. Despite recommendations from chic workmates about studios that \u201cdesign your ear\u201d for you, whatever that means, I made an appointment at a cheaper, but still clean and respectable beauty centre, for my piercing.\n\nThe curated ear: why delicate, decorative piercings are the new tattoos Read more\n\n\u201cI want to use a needle, if possible,\u201d I said confidently to the piercer, having heard that a needle produces cleaner and thus more sophisticated results than a gun. The piercer frowned. \u201cAh ... why?\u201d she said, with a look of incredulity, as if I had asked her to pierce my ear with the shard of a diamond or a carrot. I was ashamed. I mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry!,\u201d and she proceeded to gun my ears in peace. I was new to this world, after all.\n\nHaving my ears pierced once didn\u2019t satiate me. I wanted to feel more dynamic. I know that I am not old, but now that I\u2019m 30 I don\u2019t feel young-young any more. I\u2019m older than I was, and that\u2019s something. About a month ago I decided that I needed to go bigger. I needed the aesthetic currency of rebellion on my head, for all to see. I needed two more holes in my lobes before I was through.\n\nWhile I know that getting a second piercing (in your EARS no less! Not you tongue or eyebrow or lip or belly button or nipple or butt, if that\u2019s possible) belongs to a definition of rebellion that you\u2019d probably find in a 1950s anti-vandalism PSA, it still appealed to me. I only have one tattoo and it\u2019s too small for anyone to mistake me for a dynamic individual. I was pretending that I wanted the piercings because they looked aesthetically interesting when really I just thought it would look cool \u2013 something you should never admit to wanting to be, because it\u2019s a very uncool thing to admit.\n\nHad I really thought that something as shallow as a new earhole would re-energise me?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get more piercings,\u201d I said to people at work, who smiled politely while I showed them reference images. This time I didn\u2019t make an appointment at a light-filled beauty salon with delicate studs on display \u2013 my rebellion had a ticking clock on it. Instead I went to the only place that would take me after work \u2013 a waxing and piercing chain (what a one-stop shop!) housed in the dark underground level of a shopping centre in the city centre.\n\n\u201cI only got my ears pierced for the first time last year!\u201d I said to the piercer. \u201cOh really?\u201d she said sweetly, because what do you say to that. Now that I was sitting down on the plastic chair covered by a plastic sheet, I could see that this person was at least 10 years younger than me, maybe more. She had heavy eyeliner, dead straight hair and a big tattoo on her arm, dedicated to someone who had been born in 2006. \u2018That was the year I graduated high school,\u201d I almost said, but didn\u2019t say. The piercer asked where I wanted my second piercings and I admitted that I was quite stressed about the exact location, not knowing how far away it should be from my original set. \u201cYou decide, I trust you!\u201d I said shrilly, to which she shrugged and got to work. I wondered how ridiculous I seemed to her. In less than a minute she had not only pierced both my ears, but managed to do so while having a yelling conversation with the girl at reception about the shopping centre\u2019s new opening hours. It was impressive multitasking. \u201cGuess what I just did,\u201d I said to a group chat of my friends, hoping to shock them.\n\nIt was a few days until I realised what I had done. In my desire for action, my restless need to do something, I had effectively done the much more embarrassing version of chucking on a pink polo shirt, slicking my hair back with pomade and buying a Porsche. You know that episode of The Nanny where Mr Sheffield is trying to prove to his publicist what a young, desirable man he is, so he starts wearing tight jeans and leather jackets and collarless shirts and going to nightclubs (it turns out she\u2019s a lesbian and is more interested in Fran)? Well, that\u2019s what I was doing. Engaging in some sort of age-related crisis that involved me wearing large bolt studs for six weeks and wincing every time I accidentally touched my earlobes. Had I really thought that something as shallow as a new earhole would re-energise me?\n\nI always felt I wasn't clever enough for poetry. But this was like making a new exciting friend | Sinead Stubbins Read more\n\nThe thing is, deep down in my rapidly ageing guts, I know that being a real rebel has nothing at all to do with how many miscellaneous holes you\u2019ve poked in your body, or eschewing top 40 musicians, or having a mohawk so tall that it gives the impression that you have been electrocuted (although, that is very cool, I have to say). Real rebellion is less predictable than that.\n\nReal rebellion is when, a couple of weeks ago in Melbourne\u2019s Treasury Gardens, I saw a teenage girl with a sign that said \u201cCompost the Bourgeoisie\u201d, a tiny gentleman in a trilby hat with a placard that said \u201cThanks for ruining my life ScoMo, you idiot\u201d, and a group of five elderly ladies with canes carrying around a placard that said \u201cGrandmas For Climate Action\u201d. This wasn\u2019t performative defiance involving piercings \u2013 it was actual defiance. That\u2019s harder to fake. I found it all so moving that I cried like a baby on and off for about two hours (behind my sunglasses, of course). My large studs and I were shamed.\n\nThis week signals that enough time has passed that I can take out the obnoxious studs and can replace them with a more subtle, chic hoop. It\u2019s a pretty big achievement, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve made it this far. Perhaps now I\u2019ll get a trilby hat.\n\n\u2022 Sinead Stubbins is a writer and cultural critic\n\n\u2022 Comments on this piece will be premoderated", "description": "Deep down I know that being a rebel has nothing to do with it.
