However, the cause of death on the death certificate the family have received has so far been left blank and his family called for an independent inquiry when they met Ms Milling, the MP for Cannock Chase, on Friday.\n\nIn a statement afterwards, Ms Milling said she would support their demands for a probe. \"The tragic death of Robert Spray while he was in Bulgaria to watch the England match was horrific news,\" the MP said. \"His family deserve all the help and support they can get in this difficult time. I am very pleased to see the online appeal for financial assistance has been so successful, showing how strong the community spirit is in our area and how much people thought of Robert. The circumstances around his death raise a number of serious questions and the family rightly are seeking answers to these questions.\"", "description": "The death of an England fan in Bulgarian custody last week raises \"a number of serious questions\", the family's local MP has said after meeting with relatives and pledging to help lobby the Foreign Office to investigate.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Tom Morgan", "Football News Correspondent", "Sports News Correspondent", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000213315145-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-RpvcHkEPpt0rIYKvNdyWtFW1VSJ6kv9JPirGCha838.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
