We all know their brand names, imbedded on our brain cells as synonyms for corporate evil: Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon.\n\nThe Liberal plan was laid out in two sentences as part of a \u201cMaking Taxes More Fair\u201d section of the platform. The proposal was dubbed a \u201cNetflix tax,\u201d although the words make it clear that Ottawa has much bigger ambitions that involve joining the global effort to change the way the world taxes corporate profits.\n\nIn the words of the platform, the Trudeau Liberals said they plan to \u201cMake sure that multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada. We will also work to achieve the standard set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure that international digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada collect and remit the same level of sales taxation as Canadian digital corporations.\u201d\n\nThis is much more than a plan for a simple Netflix sales tax to be paid by Canadian subscribers to stream the latest episode of Unbelievable. Buried in the platform language is the intent to somehow tax the tech giants on the tax-free profits they allegedly make in Canada but do not record in Canada.\n\nAccording to the platform, the plan to make \u201cmultinational tech giants pay their fair share\u201d will produce average annual federal revenue of about $600 million beginning April 1, 2020. As the Parliamentary Budget Officer put it, there is \u201chigh uncertainty\u201d around that revenue stream, in large part because the plan is something of a tax policy dream scenario now being cooked up by bureaucrats and other corporate taxationists at the OECD. There is no data.\n\nImposing a basic sales tax on Netflix and other digital services \u2014 already applied in many countries, regions and cities around the world \u2014 is not the main objective of the new Liberal plan. Such taxes \u2014GSTs and HSTs \u2014 are paid by consumers, not corporations. The digital GST rate in Australia is 10 per cent. In Quebec it is 9.975 per cent.\n\nThe bigger tax grab lurking in the Liberal platform is advance acceptance of the emerging global scheme to allow national governments to tax profits that are recorded by tech giants in other jurisdictions, mainly the United States.\n\nThis is often described as profit pillaging. The solution, according the OECD and others, is to begin taxing the local revenues of the corporations.\n\nTaxing corporate revenues rather than profits is an aggressively novel \u2014 even revolutionary \u2014 version of a corporate tax grab. The OECD has been struggling with the scheme for some time. Rather than wait for a final OECD international agreement, France imposed a three per cent digital tax on the gross local revenues the tech companies derive from digital activities in France.\n\nThe justification for taxing gross revenues seems a little bit of a stretch. When a Japanese auto company sells a new car in Canada, Ottawa does not have the power to tax the profits the Japanese automaker records in Japan. What is the difference between importing a car and importing digital products and services?\n\nThe argument is that when a Japanese car company exports cars to Canada, it must pay to transport the cars within Canada, build distribution and sales infrastructure, employ people, provide profits to local dealers, operate a corporate structure. All this generates economic activity, revenues and taxes within Canada. Digital products \u2014 from video streaming to gambling services to e-books and news content \u2014 require little or no comparable infrastructure. Therefore, they cannot be taxed.\n\nTax experts call this \u201ctax base erosion.\u201d But surely this conclusion perverts the economic benefit of digital products. While local governments and business interests lose sources of revenue, that\u2019s because there is little or even no need for infrastructure or added local effort. That\u2019s a benefit, not a loss. The attempt to tax digital services on their gross revenue becomes an attempt to tax and pocket economic benefits from a cost that does not exist. If no bricks and mortar are needed, then there are no bricks and mortar to tax.\n\nThe associated economic claim is that the digital services produce something called \u201cuser-created value\u201d in the importing country that should be viewed as taxable. Perversely, the global tech tax plan is to replace taxes that occurred because of local costs, with new taxes based on some unmeasurable user-created value. They plan to tax the cost savings.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange objective, one that requires a centrally planned allocation of digital company global profits among consuming nations so they can be taxed locally. The latest OECD report consumes pages explaining how it needs a method to determine how tech giant profits should be allocated in a way that would provide national jurisdictions with a \u201cnew taxing right.\u201d\n\nSo far, the OECD has not found the method. Bruce Ball, vice-president of taxation at CPA Canada, says it is important that an agreement be reached to avoid \u201ca significant risk that unilateral measures would heighten complexity, raise more uncertainty for businesses, and cause more lost tax revenues for governments.\u201d\n\nThere is reason to doubt the OECD will reach a consensus before the end of 2020 \u2014 which means the Trudeau Liberals plan to join France in a unilateral pursuit of a digital tax grab.\n\n\u2022 Email: tcorcoran@nationalpost.com | Twitter: terencecorcoran", "description": "There is an emerging global scheme to allow national governments to tax profits recorded by tech giants in other jurisdictions, mainly the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/netflix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
