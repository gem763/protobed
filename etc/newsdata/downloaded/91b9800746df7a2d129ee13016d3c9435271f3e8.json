Two white friends make fun of their white male peer for spending time with a black girl from school.\n\nWe brought our hidden cameras to Alabama, where a child named McKenzie Adams died by suicide late last year. Her family says the fourth grader had been receiving derogatory remarks from classmates because of her race and friendship with a white student.\n\nIn addition to bullying in schools, cyberbullying has also become a serious issue for children. According to a report that was released in July by the National Center for Education Statistics, online bullying had a 3.5% increase from the 2014-2015 school year to the 2016 school year for 12 to 18 year olds.\n\nIn tonight\u2019s episode, we see how customers react when a child is told by her classmates that she should not be hanging out with a white boy. The bullies, played by actors Annabeth and Kayden, want their friend, played by John, to sit with them, instead of with his black friend, played by Kamayah.\n\nABC\n\nAnnabeth: I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re hanging out together.\n\nKayden: I know, she thinks she\u2019s so cool hanging out with her white friend.\n\nAnnabeth: She needs to go hang out with her people.\n\nKamayah: I didn\u2019t say anything to you guys. Can\u2019t you just leave me alone?\n\nJohn: Yeah, she isn\u2019t bothering you.\n\nAnnabeth: Why are you defending the black girl?\n\nAs our bullies torment Kamayah while sitting at Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q in Decatur, Alabama, nearby customers observe.\n\nOne woman, Susan, can\u2019t stay silent and approaches the children. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing,\u201d she says to our bullies, crouching down to their level, \u201cbut being an adult, I\u2019m not going to sit in this restaurant and bully people like that. It is wrong, and if your parents have not taught you that, you are being rude and insulting.\u201d\n\nWhen bully Kayden asks her, \u201cDo you think they belong together?\u201d Susan doesn\u2019t miss a beat and asks him, \u201cWho says they don\u2019t belong together?\u201d Before sitting back down with her family, Susan turns to our friends Kamayah and John, and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that people think they can act like that today.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nWhen our host ABC's John Qui\u00f1ones breaks the scene to interview her, she motions to her parents, who are sitting with her. \u201cIt\u2019s the way my parents brought me up. You don\u2019t treat people differently because of their race, their color, their religion, their whatever. It\u2019s not the way I was taught, and I\u2019m not going to sit by idly and watch that.\u201d\n\nThe support doesn\u2019t stop there. Another diner, Irvin, watches and shakes his head.\n\nWhen our actress Kamayah goes to him, seeking advice, he states, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about them. There\u2019s stupid people everywhere, trust me. Y\u2019all just keep being you.\u201d Irvin, a black man, then shares something personal, \u201cMy wife\u2019s white. I don\u2019t care.\u201d To comfort the kids even more, he goes to the counter to tell our actress, Teance, playing the waitress, that he\u2019d like to pay for Kamayah\u2019s and John\u2019s meals.\n\nWhen Kayden and Annabeth keep badgering Kamayah, asking her, \u201cDo you hang out with him because you want to be white?\u201d another customer Teresa, a mother of five, stands from her seat and approaches them. She sits with the bullies and states in a calm voice, \u201cSome things are just plain mean.\u201d\n\nWhen Annabeth defiantly says, \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be friends,\u201d Teresa says, \u201cIt\u2019s not for you to say.\u201d She then moves to the other table, sitting next to Kamayah to check on her. She calls Kamayah beautiful, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody bring you down and devalue you. There\u2019s a lot of ignorant people in life and you\u2019re just going to have to learn how to move forward.\u201d She also offers to pay for Kamayah\u2019s and John\u2019s meals.\n\nIn the final scene, customers Pete and Cathy, a couple, happen to be sitting behind our actors Kamayah and John. They hear the harassment, and Pete turns around in his seat to deliver a warning to our bullies. \u201cI\u2019m going to call a police officer in a minute and let him talk to you. You need to be quiet.\u201d Cathy tells John, \u201cYou have to realize it\u2019s their insecurity, not yours,\u201d before she stands up to search for Kamayah.\n\nWhen Cathy finds Kamayah, she gives her a warm embrace. As they sit back down, Kamayah then gives Cathy another hug, thanking her. \u201cNobody deserves that,\u201d Cathy says, holding her close.\n\nOnce Qui\u00f1ones sits down with them, Cathy emotionally advises, \u201cTeach your children young, teach them to love, and to be understanding and compassionate, because that\u2019s the greatest gifts you can give them.\u201d\n\nTo see how other people react to various scenarios, watch \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d tonight at 9/8c on ABC.", "description": "Tonight on \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d we cast actors to play children bullying their classmates because of race.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wwyd-abc-ay-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
