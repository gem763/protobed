We\u2019ve got the ability, we\u2019ve got the team, we\u2019re still the best team,\u201d said Hamilton, who still increased his championship lead over team mate Valtteri Bottas to 65 points with six races remaining.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to stop dragging our feet and get on,\u201d he added, promising to \u201cget back in the scrum\u201d and come back fighting at next weekend\u2019s Russian Grand Prix.\n\nHamilton had started the night race on the front row, alongside Leclerc, but lost out on strategy after Vettel pitted first of the top three.\n\nWAKE-UP CALL\n\nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff had said on Saturday that qualifying was a wake-up call and he was just as forthright a day later.\n\n\u201cWe had a slow car out of the blocks at the beginning, after every single (safety car) re-start we were lacking pace and that\u2019s the harsh reality,\u201d said the Austrian, whose team started the season with five one-two finishes.\n\n\u201cI think we had a car capable for pole yesterday and we had an opportunity to win today, but we made too many mistakes. We\u2019re aware that we didn\u2019t deliver to the standards we set ourselves this weekend.\u201d\n\nAndrew Shovlin, the team\u2019s head of trackside engineering, said Mercedes had missed an open goal by not taking an \u2018undercut\u2019, pitting early to try and leapfrog then-leader Leclerc, on lap 19.\n\nFerrari did that with Vettel in what turned out to be the decisive move of the race.\n\n\u201cWe had talked about it but didn\u2019t really react quickly enough to how fast Charles\u2019 tyres were dropping,\u201d said Shovlin.\n\n\u201cWe should have made that call with Lewis, and made it late enough that they would not be able to react. That was our opportunity to win and it\u2019s upsetting when you let something like that slip through your fingers.\u201d\n\nFormula One F1 - Singapore Grand Prix - Marina Bay Street Circuit, Singapore - September 22, 2019 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in action during the race REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nMercedes have won every title in the V6 turbo-hybrid era that started in 2014 and are heading towards an unprecedented sixth successive drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 title double this season.\n\nHamilton\u2019s closest rivals after Bottas are Leclerc and Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen, both 96 points adrift of the Briton in the championship.
