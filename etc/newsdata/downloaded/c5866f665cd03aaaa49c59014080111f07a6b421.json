I hope [Weinstein] gets prosecuted and, of course, I want there to be justice. It turns out nearly every single woman I know or have worked with has been harassed or assaulted in some way. I just didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the interview Delevingne offered her thoughts on gender inequality in the film industry and explained that while movements such as #TimesUp can help, there\u2019s much more to be done if we\u2019re to see a real improvement.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, especially in these movements, as soon as we get a hashtag for something, we feel like it\u2019s done,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s the beginning, and I think people need to remember that [gender discrimination is] still happening all the time.\u201d Delevingne went on to say that while women are getting more opportunities than ever before, \u201cthere are still people out there who are the same as they were three years ago\u201d in terms of progression.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just put a hashtag up on social media and the problem is gone,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "Cara Delevingne has revealed she was unsure as to what constituted sexual assault prior to the #MeToo movement.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/08/gettyimages-821664034.jpg"}
