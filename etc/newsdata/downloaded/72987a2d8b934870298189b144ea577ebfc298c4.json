(Reuters) - (This story corrects 19th paragraph to remove attribution to Bohen.)\n\nPeople visit the Alien Research Center in Hiko, as an influx of tourists responding to a call to 'storm' Area 51, a secretive U.S. military base believed by UFO enthusiasts to hold government secrets about extra-terrestrials, is expected in Rachel, Nevada, U.S. September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart\n\nUFO enthusiasts began descending on rural Nevada on Thursday near the secret U.S. military installation known as Area 51, long rumoured to house government secrets about alien life, with local authorities hoping the visitors were coming in peace.\n\nSome residents of Rachel, a remote desert town of 50 people a short distance from the military base, worried their community might be overwhelmed by unruly crowds turning out in response to a recent, viral social-media invitation to \u201cstorm\u201d Area 51. The town, about 150 miles (240 km) north of Las Vegas, lacks a grocery store or even a gasoline station.\n\nDozens of visitors began arriving outside Rachel\u2019s only business - an extraterrestrial-themed motel and restaurant called the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn - parking themselves in cars, tents and campers. A fire truck was stationed nearby.\n\nOne couple, Nicholas Bohen and Cayla McVey, both sporting UFO tattoos, travelled to Rachel from the Los Angeles suburb of Fullerton with enough food to last for a week of car-camping.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s evolved into a peaceful gathering, a sharing of life stories,\u201d McVey told Reuters, sizing up the crowd. \u201cI think you are going to get a group of people that are prepared, respectful and they know what they getting themselves into.\u201d\n\nArea 51 was shrouded in secrecy for decades, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of its alien crew from the crash of an unidentified flying object in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. government did not confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes.\n\nThe documents, however, did not end suspicion about space aliens there.\n\nRachel and its surroundings have long celebrated their place in UFO lore as a tourist draw. A 98-mile (158-km) road running through the area is dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, a purported hotbed of UFO sightings.\n\nIn June, California college student Matty Roberts posted a facetious Facebook invitation exhorting the public at large to run into Area 51 on foot to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d\n\nWhen more than 1 million people expressed interest, the U.S. Air Force admonished curiosity seekers not to breach the gates at the military base, which it said is still used to test combat aircraft and train personnel.\n\n\u201cNO STOPPING IT\u201d\n\nRoberts then teamed up with Connie West, co-owner of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, to plan a music festival in Rachel dubbed \u201cAlienstock\u201d to entertain the expected crowds.\n\nIn early September, however, Roberts disassociated himself from the Rachel event, saying it was poorly organised and he feared it could devolve into a public safety crisis. Instead, he helped stage an alternative Alienstock set to take place Thursday night in Las Vegas. Beer brand Bud Light signed on as a sponsor and designed limited-edition, green beer cans featuring alien heads.\n\nWest said the event in Rachel would go on as planned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening. There was no stopping it,\u201d she said on Thursday, adding that some visitors had come from as far away as Australia and New Zealand. \u201cI hope they just enjoy the party we are throwing.\u201d\n\nAbout 40 miles (64 km) east of Rachel, the small town of Hiko planned an event called \u201cStorm Area 51 Basecamp\u201d at a gift shop dubbed the Alien Research Center. Organizers promised musicians, artists and \u201cprominent ufologists,\u201d and by Thursday had sold 3,200 tickets, according to Linda Looney, manager of the shop.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing has been a shock to this little community,\u201d she said, adding that organizers had hired 15 security guards and a private ambulance and ordered 80 portable toilets. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really cool. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nThe influx of alien hunters prompted Lincoln County, which encompasses Rachel and Hiko, to draft an emergency declaration that could be invoked if needed to call in help from the state.\n\nThe Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office said visitors should expect \u201ca large presence of law enforcement.\u201d Authorities urged everyone to bring ample supplies of food, water and fuel.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nFive sheriff\u2019s patrol cars were posted just outside the Area 51 gate, where a handful of people had come to take photos.\n\nDespite a festive, peaceful mood back in town, the official Rachel website was decidedly unwelcoming.\n\n\u201cIf any event still happens it is going to be a pretty sad affair with no bands, no food, very little infrastructure and a lot of unhappy campers,\u201d it said.", "description": "(This story corrects 19th paragraph to remove attribution to Bohen.)", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431777125&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I25V", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
