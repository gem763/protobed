And once that got shut down now you've got a lot more people that are trying to evade apprehension which then causes of course violence to go up on the border.\"\n\nAt the same time, if other cities follow Chicago's lead, the repercussions could also intensify in that respect.\n\n\"You know you've got California right now and they're reeling from a homeless crisis,\" he said.\n\nGOP LAWMAKER DIGS UP AUDIO OF SCHIFF TELLING PRANK CALLERS HE WOULD ACCEPT TRUMP DIRT FROM UKRAINE\n\n\"They're reeling from a crisis that is caused by a lot of illegal aliens as far as the crime goes in their cities and so yeah once you get a major city like Chicago that is going to make the decision that they are going to consciously not work with federal authorities to enforce federal laws and you can expect to also see it in other similar sanctuary cities.\"\n\nJudd also claimed many of the top police brass or elected officials who make decisions not to cooperate with DHS often do so because of their political aspirations.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"They do it for politics and frankly they're trying to get re-elected,\" he said. \"The first concern should always be their constituents.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, CPD confirmed the memo came from an internal superior but would not say if the directive came from the mayor. Chicago police sources told Fox News that officers have historically assisted federal agents and this new policy puts CPD and DHS agents in potentially dangerous situations.\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.", "description": "National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd criticized the Chicago Police Department's memo advising officers not to cooperate with the Department of Homeland Security.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Judd-BP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
