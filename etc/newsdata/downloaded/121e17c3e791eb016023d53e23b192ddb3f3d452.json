He was 80.\n\nGott died late Tuesday at his home in Prague after battling a long illness, his wife Ivana said in a statement. Gott recently announced he had acute leukemia.\n\nGott released some 300 albums starting in the 1960s and sold tens of millions of copies in his country, the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the Communist world.\n\nBut he was also a rare example of a pop singer from eastern Europe whose music became popular in some Western European countries, especially in West Germany.\n\n\u201cThe golden voice from Prague\u201d as Gott was called in that country, had one of the biggest hits there with \u201cMaya the Bee\u201d (\u201cDie Biene Maja\u201d in German), the title song from a 1970s cartoon television series.\n\nCzech President Milos Zeman said Wednesday his death is sad news for the entire country.\n\nPrime Minister Andrej Babis proposed a state funeral for Gott at the St. Vitus Cathedral, the country\u2019s biggest church. It was not immediately clear when that might happen.\n\nBabis said he wanted the funeral day to be declared a day of national mourning.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Czech pop singer Karel Gott, who became a star behind the Iron Curtain, has died.
