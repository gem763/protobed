Based on the Shakespeare play, it tells the story of the bon vivant Falstaff with German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape making his debut in the role. A witty comedy of infidelity and mistrust - based on the famous Shakespeare play - but this time with a German twist.\n\nThe Berlin State Opera celebrated its season premiere with Otto Nicolai's \u201cThe Merry Wives of Windsor\u201d (\"Die Lustigen Weiber von Windsor\"). In the title role of Sir John Falstaff is the German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape. German Maestro Daniel Barenboim conducts the lighthearted score. He spoke to Euronews about directing the comedy, fending off accusations that his country people were humourless.\n\n\"This piece is part of the DNA of this country [Germany]. It\u2018s pure German humour.\"\n\nHe was joined by Bass singer Ren\u00e9 Pape who laughingly reasserted the existence of \u201cGerman humour\u201d: \u201cthough this opera is Shakespeare esque but we are definitely funny people\u201d. He added that the performance interpolated other sources to the original text, \u201cYou can also see that in Nicolai's composition. He has interwoven many quotes from other works and there is a light touch to them.\u201d\n\nThe German composer conducted at the world premiere 170 years ago but died shortly after (at 38 years old), but left a strong impression on the opera world.\n\n\u201cNicolai was a very important personality. Born in Germany he worked a lot in Vienna where he founded the Vienna Philharmonic,\" said Daniel Barenboim.\n\nThe Cuckold of Windsor Village\n\nLike Verdi's \"Falstaff\" Otto Nicolai based his opera on the tale of a \"fat knight\", with his best days behind him. He tries to seduce two women who then plot against him, culminating in his derision as a cuckold of the Windsor village. Stage director David B\u00f6sch reflected on the class and gender dynamics at play.\n\n\"On one hand you have this sort of bourgeois idyllic world of the women of Windsor. They are just killing time and start a game with somebody who is totally different from them. And there is the other world of Falstaff, who decides that he wants to live his life differently, not in a bourgeois way.\"\n\nDynamics that give the opera strong comedy elements, or as Otto Nicolai called the masterpiece a \u201ccomical-fantastical opera\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Fantastical part is this moon choir at the end of the third act and the elves and the mosquitoes and flies and midges,\" said Ren\u00e9 Pape. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairy-tale.\"", "description": "\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" at the Berlin State Opera is Otto Nicolai's comical-fantastical opera ( based originally on the Shakespeare's play) and tells the story of the bon vivant Falstaff with German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape makes his debut in the role.
