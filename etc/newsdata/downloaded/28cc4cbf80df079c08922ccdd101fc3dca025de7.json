You know, we love China. We love playing there,\" Harden said at a practice in Tokyo, flanked by fellow All-Star guard Russell Westbrook.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love. So we appreciate them as a fan base. We love everything there about them, and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as an organization.\"\n\nRockets General Manager Daryl Morey in a since-deleted tweet on Friday voiced support for the thousands of protesters that have taken to the streets of Hong Kong in the last few months, writing, \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrations in the semi-autonomous city started as a protest of a law that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nIn response to Morey's statement, the Chinese Basketball Association and several TV providers suspended ties with the Rockets.\n\nMorey issued a statement on Twitter Sunday, saying he did not intend \"to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.\"\n\nThe NBA issued its own statement, saying on Sunday it recognized that Morey's comments \"have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\nThe NBA's position has been panned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have accused the league of putting money over human rights.\n\nSen.
