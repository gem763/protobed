(AP) - About a quarter of Navajo women and some infants who were part of a federally funded study on uranium exposure had high levels of the radioactive metal in their systems, decades after mining for Cold War weaponry ended on their reservation, a U.S. health official Monday.\n\nThe preliminary findings from the University of New Mexico study were shared during a congressional field hearing in Albuquerque. Dr. Loretta Christensen - the chief medical officer on the Navajo Nation for Indian Health Service, a partner in the research - said 781 women were screened during an initial phase of the study that ended last year.\n\nAmong them, 26% had concentrations of uranium that exceeded levels found in the highest 5% of the U.S. population, and newborns with equally high concentrations continued to be exposed to uranium during their first year, she said.\n\nThe research is continuing as authorities work to clear uranium mining sites across the Navajo Nation.\n\n\u201cIt forces us to own up to the known detriments associated with a nuclear-forward society,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, who is an enrolled member of Laguna Pueblo, a tribe whose jurisdiction lies west of Albuquerque.\n\nThe hearing held in Albuquerque by U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, Haaland and U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, all Democrats from New Mexico, sought to underscore the atomic age\u2019s impact on Native American communities.\n\nThe three are pushing for legislation that would expand radiation compensation to residents in their state, including post-1971 uranium workers and residents who lived downwind from the Trinity Test site in southern New Mexico.\n\nThe state\u2019s history has long been intertwined with development of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, from uranium mining and the first atomic blast to the Manhattan project conducted through work in the once-secret city of Los Alamos. The federal Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, however, only covers parts of Nevada, Arizona and Utah that are downwind from a different nuclear test site.\n\nDuring the hearing, Haaland said one of her own family members had lost his hearing because of radiation exposure. At Laguna Pueblo, home to her tribe, the Jackpile-Paguate Mine was once among the world\u2019s largest open-pit uranium mines. It closed several decades ago, but cleanup has yet to be completed.\n\n\u201cThey need funds,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cThey job was not completed.\u201d\n\nDavid Gray, a deputy regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said the mine illustrates uranium mining and milling\u2019s lingering effects on Indian Country.\n\nOn the Navajo Nation, EPA figures show authorities are investigating and cleaning more than 200 abandoned uranium mines, using settlements and other agreements to pay for the work that has taken decades. \u201cA daunting task,\u201d Gray said.\n\nUdall, who chaired the hearing, acknowledged federal officials had shown progress but that the pace of cleanup has proven frustrating for some community members.\n\n\u201cThey feel an urgency,\u201d Udall said. \u201cThey feel that things need to happen today.\u201d\n\nIn her testimony, Christensen described how Navajo residents in the past had used milling waste in home construction, resulting in contaminated walls and floors.\n\nFrom the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, millions of tons of uranium ore were extracted from the Navajo Nation, leaving gray streaks across the desert landscape, as well as a legacy of disease and death.\n\nWhile no large-scale studies have connected cancer to radiation exposure from uranium waste, many have been blamed it for cancer and other illnesses.\n\nBy the late 1970s, when the mines began closing around the reservation, miners were dying of lung cancer, emphysema or other radiation-related ailments.\n\n\u201cThe government is so unjust with us,\u201d said Leslie Begay, a former uranium miner who lives in Window Rock, an Arizona town that sits near the New Mexico border and serves as the Navajo Nation capital. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t recognize that we built their freedom.\u201d\n\nBegay, who said he has lung problems, attended the hearing with an oxygen tank in tow. The hearing was especially meaningful for him after traveling in the past to Washington to advocate for himself and others, he said.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press reporter Felicia Fonseca in Flagstaff, Arizona, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "About a quarter of Navajo women and some infants who were part of a federally funded study on uranium exposure had high levels of the radioactive metal in their systems, decades after mining for Cold War weaponry ended on their reservation, a U.S. health official Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mary Hudetz"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/nuclear_legacy_minorities_44757_c0-218-3000-1967_s1770x1032.jpg?9d0c8dd19ad25a0f745ecd7e1bb85a76ee2d80c4", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
