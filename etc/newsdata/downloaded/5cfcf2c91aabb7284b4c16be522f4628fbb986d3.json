These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the eight-game main slate beginning at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nRobert Dugger - Miami (at Pittsburgh)\n\nLet me begin this write-up by pointing out that Dugger is an extreme risk/reward play. The good news comes from Dugger\u2019s dirt-cheap salary and strong showing (7 IP, 3 H, 7 K) against Cincinnati last week. Now for the not so good news. Dugger got shelled for six earned runs through five innings in his other MLB start (Aug. 5 @ NYM) this season. He also holds a scary 7.59 ERA through 53.1 innings at the Triple-A level. That begs the question, is the rookie starting to figure things out, or was his recent appearance against the Reds just a mirage? We\u2019ll find out when he faces the Pirates tonight, who rank middle-of-the-pack in most crucial hitting categories.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nC.J. Cron - Minnesota (at Boston)\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been a roller-coaster of a season for Cron, who has looked like a mainstay for Minnesota\u2019s \u201cBomba Squad\u201d at times but battled injuries and bouts of general inconsistencies too. However, he has been a reliable bat against left-handed pitching this season, holding a 160 wRC+ and .414 wOBA split that outranks the likes of Mike Trout, Pete Alonso, and Nolan Arenado in that regard. Boston LHP Eduardo Rodriguez is a solid hurler, but he\u2019s far from bulletproof - especially at hitter-friendly Fenway Park. Cron and his teammates could add to their MLB record \u201cbomba\u201d total this evening.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nJonathan Schoop - Minnesota (at Boston)\n\nSchoop has lost time to rookie second baseman Luis Arraez, but the veteran is still a serviceable fantasy option against left-handed pitching. Take his most recent five starts for example, as Schoop blasted four homers with seven RBIs over that span. As mentioned in the previous write-up, the hitter-friendly dimensions of Fenway Park certainly play towards the favor of Minnesota\u2019s homer-happy club. Don\u2019t be surprised if Schoop gets in on the action tonight.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nEvan Longoria - San Francisco (at St. Louis)\n\nLongoria has been surging over the past month, and he could keep that theme at St. Louis tonight. Cardinals\u2019 RHP Michael Wacha looked solid in his most recent start against Cincinnati last week, but we can\u2019t forget about his vulnerable .353 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Longoria, Mauricio Dubon (more on him in a moment), and Kevin Pillar are my favorite San Francisco bats to take advantage.\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nMauricio Dubon - San Francisco (at St. Louis)\n\nWe\u2019ll need to double-check if Dubon is in the lineup before jumping on him in tournaments. He has an interesting power/speed combination emphasized with 20 homers and 10 steals at Triple-A this season. Dubon flexed some of that with a homer earlier this series, and he\u2019ll look to jump on Wacha\u2019s aforementioned .353 wOBA split to right-handed bats.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nMark Canha - Oakland (vs. LA Angels)\n\nCanha typically checks in as an underrated DFS asset, as he doesn\u2019t have a ton of name recognition while playing for a sneaky-good Oakland offense. Canha has been known as a platoon bat against left-handed pitching throughout most of his career, and he\u2019ll see a generous rookie southpaw in LAA hurler Patrick Sandoval tonight. I\u2019m expecting the A\u2019s to score some runs in this matchup, and Canha is a strong pick to extend his recent tear (.340 avg, 5 HRs, 12 runs, 10 RBIs in 13 games).\n\nVictor Reyes - Detroit (at Kansas City)\n\nMost people will be looking to jump all over Detroit RHP Edwin Jackson in this matchup. I can\u2019t say that I blame them, as KC hitters like Adalberto Mondesi, Ryan O\u2019Hearn, Jorge Soler, and Alex Gordon certainly have my attention as well. However, let\u2019s not forget about the generosity of Kansas City RHP Jakob Junis, who owns a .340 wOBA split to left-handed bats over the past two years ... Meanwhile, Reyes is a switch-hitter batting leadoff with 13 hits, four doubles, and two stolen bases over his past four games. Definitely give him a strong look through all formats tonight.", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks on Wednesday, September 4.
