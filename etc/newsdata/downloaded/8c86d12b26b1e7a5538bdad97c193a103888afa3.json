With Endgame, the company it wanted to extend its security coverage to laptops and servers. It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that Endpoint is built on top of Elastic technology.\n\nThe company announced that it\u2019s going to offer an unusual pricing model for this tool. Banon says that instead of charging by the machine as is the industry norm, it\u2019s going to charge based on the amount of data stored. He says it\u2019s an essential change to carry the security and coverage across the range of tools.\n\n\u201cWe deeply believe in order to converge segments like SIEM and endpoint, you not only want to have the same technology stack, but you also want to provide customers with the same packaging and pricing. This is a first in the endpoint market, and we think it\u2019s a big deal when it comes to security users and CISOs and CIOs out there,\u201d Banon told TechCrunch.\n\nElastic is at its heart a search tool, but it has been expanding what that search tool covers over the years beyond web and enterprise search to other areas like applications performance management, log management and security.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement is about expanding that security component to enable the company to offer more comprehensive coverage across an organization. Endpoint\u2019s 150 employees, which are mostly engineers and data scientists, have joined Elastic and will be providing the company with a machine learning knowledge boost to help make sense of the growing amounts of data across the Elastic toolset.\n\nEndgame is based in Arlington, Virginia and will keep its offices there.
