REST has two million members, many of whom work in retail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr McVeigh's statement of claim alleges REST should have complied with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nFor example, one of the TCFD's key recommended disclosures is for funds to stress test their portfolios based on a variety of different climate scenarios.\n\nMr McVeigh's claim also alleges the trustee must go to each of its external investment managers to seek information about how they are managing climate risks.\n\nREST denies it is obliged to do so. It also denies being required to demonstrate compliance with the TFCD recommendations.", "description": "REST concedes climate change is a risk but doesn't admit the phenomenon will necessarily have a material impact on its investments, court documents reveal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d6eb218e7ff46962b0b4770fe5069214eb573b4c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
