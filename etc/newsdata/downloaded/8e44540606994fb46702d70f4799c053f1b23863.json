Move on swiftly Anneka!\"\n\nWhen appearing on This Morning Anneka did the same thing while she was chatting with Kevin, who was forced to confirm it was his phone she was touching.\n\nMovie week saw Anneka and Kevin perform a Kill Bill themed Charleston,but judge Bruni Tonioli said they \"slaughtered\" the dance.\n\n\"It was stopping and starting like a bad internet connection\", added Craig Revel Horwood.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe was voted off by the judges with her dance partner Kevin Clifton after their performance failed to impress.\n\nAnd Anneka blamed the song they were given by producers for their poor performance.\n\nShe told Rylan that she had not chosen the song they danced to and that theirs was significantly worse than the songs the other couples were given.\n\n\"I never want to hear that song again\", she said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"All the other songs [on the night] made your heart soar. But with our song...I'm not surprised people couldn't bear it.\"\n\n\"It was like an alarm clock\" said Kevin.\n\nAnneka added: \"It was like being in the middle of roadworks\".\n\n\"We don't get to chose our own songs\".\n\nShe declared her love for her dance partner, saying: I love this man, he's the most brilliant patient man I've met in a long time\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe couple found themselves in the dreaded dance-off against David James and his partner Nadiya Bychkova.\n\nBoth pairings were tasked with performing for a second time, as their fates remained in the hands of the judges.\n\nCraig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas, Bruno Tonioli and new judge Motsi Mabuse then had to reveal the couple they wished to save, and the vote was unanimous.\n\nJudge Craig was first to reveal his verdict, saving David and Nadiya.\n\nHe said: \"For commitment and improvement, I\u2019d like to save David & Nadiya.\"\n\nMotsi echoed this vote, adding: \"I felt a more emotional show, a stronger couple - I\u2019m going to save David and Nadiya.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nBruno was next, and he said: \"I would go for the couple that was more convincing and that delivered more under pressure, the performance was up a notch from Saturday night. David and Nadiya.\u201d\n\nWith three votes out of four saving David, Head Judge Shirley didn't need to vote but she said she too would have chosen the same couple.\n\nShe said: \"Yes, I would have also saved David and Nadiya.\u201d\n\nThis is the earliest last year's champion Kevin has left the series, with him having been in almost every final since he joined the show.\n\nHe was reportedly overheard moaning \"I told you so\" to fellow dancers when he was booted off the show in week two.\n\nLast year, Kevin lifted the glitter ball trophy for the first time with his now-girlfriend Stacey Dooley.", "description": "Anneka Rice's wandering hands struck again as she grabbed Kevin Clifton's hard bulge - before blaming the producers' song choice for her elimination", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Itv", "Pa", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533122.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Anneka-Rice-grabs-Kevin-Cliftons-bulge-on-It-Takes-Two-as-she-blames-producers-for-early-exit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
