During the latest trip, from October 24 to 25, 2019, the Secretary visited the Wichita State University Tech National Center for Aviation Training, participated in a workforce development roundtable, visited Textron Aviation Longitude and Latitude Production, and met with students from Wichita State University,\u201d Menendez wrote.\n\nMenendez specifically highlighted an Office of Special Counsel opinion that found that \u201cany action that can reasonably be construed as evidence that an individual is seeking support for or undertaking an initial \u2018campaign\u2019 to secure a nomination or election to office would be viewed as candidacy for purposes of the Hatch Act.\u201d\n\nNational Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMurkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution Senate rejects Paul effort to cut spending Overnight Defense: Latest on al-Baghdadi's death | Trump weighs releasing raid video | Pentagon reveals 2 suspects captured in raid | House to vote on impeachment procedures | Border wall fight stalls defense bill MORE (R-Ky.), have publicly said they would like Pompeo to run for the Senate.

Many in Kansas perceive his appearances in the state to be a de facto campaign effort,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nHe added that a Kansas City Star editorial urging Pompeo to \"focus on your day job\" or run for Senate \"seems to indicate his actions are already being construed as evidence of a possible candidacy by members of the press and the public in Kansas.\"\n\n\u201cHe appears frequently on TV and for interviews, and, as is true for many Secretaries of State, is known and recognized by the American public. Thus, it is even more crucial that he and the Department maintain a clear line between his actions as a federal employee and steward of the U.S. government, and any efforts that could be perceived as political in nature or laying the groundwork for potential campaign activity,\u201d Menendez added.\n\nPompeo isn\u2019t the first administration official to face accusations of violating the Hatch Act.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel sent a report to President Trump Donald John TrumpJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry READ: Army officer to tell investigators he twice reported concerns over Trump's Ukraine dealings Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution MORE earlier this month recommending that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayConway calls it 'silly' to say she threatened Washington Examiner reporter The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Presented by Better Medicare Alliance \u2014 Impeachment angst growing in GOP Reporter posts heated phone call with Kellyanne Conway MORE be removed from her job after it said she repeatedly violated the Hatch Act.\n\nIt previously found her in violation for her comments on a 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama, and it more recently found she violated the law with comments about 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.", "description": "Sen.
