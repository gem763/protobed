His body was never found.\n\nEleven suspects have been on trial in Riyadh, with five of them facing the death penalty, but hearings are held behind closed doors and the names of the defendants have not been released.\n\n\"Saudi authorities have obstructed meaningful accountability for Khashoggi\u2019s murder,\" Human Rights Watch said in a statement.\n\nThe New York-based watchdog criticised recent comments by the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in which he accepted collective responsiblity for Khashoggi's murder, but denied he was personally to blame.\n\n\"If he\u2019s serious, the crown prince and his government should provide transparency into the ongoing trial and reveal everything they know about the planning, execution, and aftermath of Khashoggi\u2019s murder,\" HRW's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said.\n\nAmnesty International said Prince Mohammed's admission of \"full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia\" would remain a public relation stunt if not met with immediate action.\n\nThis must include \"prompt and unrestricted access to independent human rights monitors into the country, including to observe and publicly report on the ongoing trial,\" said Amnesty's Middle East research director, Lynn Maalouf.\n\nIn a letter to King Salman, the Vienna-based International Press Institute demanded a transparent trial for those implicated in Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"As recommended by the UN special rapporteur, the government should support a UN-led additional criminal investigation and conduct a transparent retrial with international input, support and oversight,\" the institute said.\n\nThe grisly details of Khashoggi's murder, which emerged largely from Turkish sources, sparked a global outcry and turned Prince Mohammad into a virtual pariah.\n\nDozens of top global executives boycotted his showcase business conference, the Future Investment Initiative, last year.\n\nBut the outrage has since dissipated and the Washington Post reported that global firms including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were planning to send top executives to this year's event later this month.", "description": "International human rights groups demanded justice Wednesday for slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying that a year after his brutal murder, Saudi authorities had yet to provide any \"meaningful accountability\".
