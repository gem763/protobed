Most of the people at risk live in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nThe study shows \"the potential of climate change to reshape cities, economies, coastlines, and entire global regions within our lifetimes,\u201d said study lead author Scott Kulp, a senior scientist at Climate Central, a New Jersey-based non-profit organization.\n\n\u201cAs the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home, nations will increasingly confront questions about whether, how much, and how long coastal defenses can protect them,\u201d Kulp said.\n\nThe study used improved methods to measure the actual elevation of land throughout Asia. It found that in many locations, the land was actually several feet lower than had been thought.\n\nSea-level rise is one of the main impacts from global warming. Here's how it works: As the Earth's temperature warms, so do the seas. Heat-trapping greenhouse gases cause more land ice (glaciers and ice sheets) to melt and water to expand. Warmer water simply takes up more room than cooler water.\n\nGlobal warming will be the primary cause of future sea-level rise. The greatest uncertainty is how quickly the massive West Antarctic ice sheet will melt.\n\nOver the course of the 21st century, global sea levels are projected to rise between about 2 and 7 feet, and possibly more, according to Climate Central.\n\nIn this Sept. 4, 2019, file photo, people hold hands and navigate their way through a flooded street as it rains in Mumbai, India. The number of people threatened by climate change-triggered flooding is about three times higher than previously thought, a new study says. But it's not because of more water. It's because the land, especially in Asia and the developing world, is several feet lower than what had been calculated. More\n\n\u201cFor all of the critical research that\u2019s been done on climate change and sea-level projections, it turns out that for most of the global coast we didn\u2019t know the height of the ground beneath our feet,\u201d said Benjamin Strauss, chief scientist of Climate Central and co-author of the study.\n\n\u201cThis is a far greater problem than we understood,\u201d Strauss added. \u201cFar more people live in risky places today than we thought and the problem only multiplies in the future.\u201d\n\nHe said the new study found \u201ca huge difference\u201d in elevation in places such as Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Jakarta and Mumbai.\n\nSea-level rise experts said the study highlighted a problem with current data, especially in Asia.\n\n\u201cThis study represents very significant progress in the understanding of the risk which climate change-related sea level will cause for hundreds of million of people before the end of this century,\u201d said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of the Universite catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cIf hundreds or even tens of millions of people are flooded in Asia or Africa, it will create social and economic disruptions on a huge scale.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Communications.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Climate change caused flooding threatens 300 million in Asia", "description": "Worldwide, some 300 million people live where climate-triggered flooding will occur by mid-century, a new study suggests.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KaCEnDMxWT7osiGVOlXsiA--~B/aD0xNjU5O3c9MjQzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/3a3a004a26d7b3f856eeae1807952c8d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
