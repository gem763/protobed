Of course, we can also not hazard a guess \u2014 that is, we can not say anything about it at all. But given that I wrote yesterday about public opinion surrounding the impeachment of President Trump, this is one time when I think it\u2019s worth weighing in on the latest development; namely, the White House\u2019s decision to release, on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s reconstructed conversation (note: not a verbatim transcript) with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThis conversation seems to have triggered a nearly Yanny or Laurel-like reaction in my Twitter feed, almost as though people are seeing and hearing two different things. Everyone either seems to think it\u2019s either really bad for Trump, or not very damaging at all, with few people landing in between.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not that rare person who hears it both ways. No. I\u2019m on the side that says it\u2019s bad for Trump. And like the Yanny or Laurel thing or The Dress, I have trouble seeing how people see it any other way.\n\nBut I\u2019d also say you shouldn\u2019t take that guess very seriously. Our track record when using statistical models is pretty darn good, but when I\u2019m in guess mode, I don\u2019t claim to be much better than a replacement-level pundit.\n\nWith that said, there is a little bit of polling data that points in the bad-for-Trump direction (more about that in a moment). And for the record, this is relatively new territory for me. Up until now, I\u2019ve been skeptical of the political wisdom of impeachment for Democrats, as yesterday\u2019s post detailed.\n\nThe logic behind my this-is-bad-for-Trump guess is that the White House\u2019s record of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky represents the best\u2013case scenario for Trump. And that best-case scenario is still potentially fairly bad for him. They have Trump on record as imploring a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden, one of his most likely opponents in the 2020 general election.\n\nThe White House\u2019s spin is that the conversation is exculpatory because it doesn\u2019t contain a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 that is, a direct and explicit threat to Zelensky or a direct and explicit promise to him \u2014 in exchange for turning the screws on Biden. The problem for the White House is that its spin presumes three things to be true, all of which seem debatable:\n\nFirst, it presumes that the public actually cares about the quid pro quo, rather than viewing Trump telling a foreign leader to investigate a political rival as a prima facie abuse of presidential powers. Or, to use a term that Trump wouldn\u2019t like, the public might see it as prima facie evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Trump and a foreign power that aims to influence the election \u2014 the sort of direct evidence that was lacking in the Mueller report.\n\nSecond, the White House line presumes that the public won\u2019t see the White House\u2019s record of the conversation as containing a quid pro quo. But there are plenty of readings by which it does. In the conversation, Trump directly invokes the idea of \u201creciprocity\u201d between the United States and Ukraine. He says \u201cwe do a lot for Ukraine \u2026. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.\u201d Zelensky also discusses the purchase of Javelin missiles from the U.S. All of this comes before two fairly direct requests \u2014 Trump calls the first one a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 that Trump makes of Zelensky, one concerning a cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike and the other concerning Biden.\n\nThird, it presumes that there won\u2019t be more evidence of a quid pro quo that emerges later on. Given how rapidly the story is developing, that doesn\u2019t seem like a safe bet, either.\n\nYou might object that the public won\u2019t care so much about the technical details here. But that potentially cuts both ways. The public could view the quid pro quo part to be a technicality and see Trump\u2019s \u201cfavors\u201d/demands/requests of Zelensky to be the nut of the story.\n\nAnd keep in mind that Trump has more to lose than to gain when it comes to public opinion on impeachment. Until now, a fairly sizable number of voters \u2014 somewhere around 15 percent of the electorate \u2014 has both disapproved of Trump and disapproved of efforts to impeach him. If the hardcore Trump partisans are the only ones who believe the White House\u2019s spin, his impeachment numbers would get worse, although his approval ratings might not.\n\nAs far as polling evidence for how the public feels about Ukraine, there isn\u2019t much of it, but there is some, and it isn\u2019t great for Trump. A YouGov poll on Tuesday asked voters how they\u2019d feel about impeachment if Trump \u201csuspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country\u2019s officials to investigate his political rival\u201d; 55 percent of voters supported impeachment in that case, 26 percent opposed it. The problem is that, so far, the delay in military aid has not been proven to be related to Trump\u2019s requests of Zelensky on Biden. We don\u2019t know how much that matters to the American public. Hopefully, pollsters will ask voters different versions of questions about impeachment over Ukraine that can test the importance of the quid pro quo. Meanwhile, polling from Reuters/Ipsos suggests that while relatively few Americans knew much about the Ukraine scandal before today, those who had heard of it were more supportive of impeachment.\n\nThat\u2019s all we\u2019ve really got to work with, for now. We will, of course, track the polls in the upcoming days.", "description": "Sometimes, when a news story is still unfolding in real time, we can\u2019t do much better than to hazard a guess about how it will affect the polls.
