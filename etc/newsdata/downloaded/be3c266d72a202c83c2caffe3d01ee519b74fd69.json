Everything else is good. They've got a good running game, probably one of the best in the league. They've got real good receivers. You just want them to pass the ball. You want Kirk Cousins to get it in his hands.\"\n\nBrown and Cousins were teammates in Washington in 2017 when the team went 7-9. The quarterback ranked seventh in passing yards (4,093), eighth in touchdowns (27) and seventh in passes intercepted (13, two of which were pick-sixes). He also took the most lost yards to sack as any one in the league.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nSaid Brown, via ESPN:\n\n\u201cI realized when I was in Washington, he was kind of careless with the ball. But at the same time, hey, you make the bed you sleep in. \"I was at the Redskins with him so I know about him. That's my viewpoint on him.\"\n\nCousins signed his three-year, $84 million deal with Minnesota the ensuing offseason. Brown left Washington for Philadelphia this past summer.\n\nCousins often plays well against Eagles\n\nIt\u2019s probably not wise to give bulletin board material to a quarterback who has had the most success against your team.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgainst the Eagles, he 5-3 in his career with a career-high 17 touchdowns, five interceptions and quarterback rating of 101.2, per ESPN. He\u2019ll need to continue that since the Eagles have the league\u2019s best defense against the rush. They\u2019ve allowed an average 63.0 yards per game, while their pass defense is lacking.\n\nWhen Philadelphia shuts down the run, Cousins will need to prove he can rise up and hit targets. It will be another test for the player who looks good on paper, but doesn\u2019t deliver in big moments. And it could mean another drama-filled week in Minneapolis.\n\nCriticism of Cousins continues\n\nCousins time in Minnesota hasn\u2019t been what was expected. Following a poor showing against the Chicago Bears in Week 4, receiver Adam Thielen had harsh words for his quarterback. He was clearly frustrated by the lack of a passing game and how one-dimensional it makes even a great run game.\n\nCousins apologized to him and Thielen walked back his words.\n\nThat same week, Stefon Diggs missed practices \u2014 he said for a cold \u2014 and didn\u2019t shut down rumors he wanted to be traded. He clarified to reporters this week he \u201cnever said I was unhappy or uncomfortable with my role.\u201d Rather, he wanted to win.\n\nThe Vikings did with a 28-10 victory over the New York Giants that that elicited a call from President Donald Trump to the winning quarterback.\n\nThings have mostly quieted down in Minnesota for now.\n\nA former teammate went at Kirk Cousins ahead of their matchup.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\"Everything else is good,\" said Brown, whose Eagles play in Minnesota this weekend.", "authors": ["Cassandra Negley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wxFpgkViv4NsmPoROndN4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TcUVF6vfvQXd1Nael9XERA--~B/aD0xNzk5O3c9MjY5ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c8eac710-e4f9-11e9-bf77-d18c862bb950", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
