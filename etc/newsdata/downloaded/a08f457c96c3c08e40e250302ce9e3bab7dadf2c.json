Inc. SAM, +1.11% shares to underperform from hold on Tuesday, citing \"competitive risk in hard seltzers.\" While Grundy expects the hard-seltzer category to double again by the end of 2021, he cites a recent Jefferies consumer survey indicating that there is low brand loyalty and strong interest in trying new brands within the hard-seltzer industry. \"Recently announced entrants have experienced a significant ~6x/< ~40x the number of social-media interactions on Instagram/Twitter as incumbent brands, with most of the former also enjoying a greater number of total followers,\" he wrote. On Friday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Fernando Ferreira wrote that while social-media posts about beer were on the decline, posts mentioning hard seltzer were climbing, though only about 3% of those posts mentioned Truly, Boston Beer's brand. Bank of America said that 84% of posts mentioned White Claw, made by Mark Anthony Brands. Boston Beer shares have risen 39% over the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% has gained 6.6%.", "description": "Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy downgraded Boston Beer Co.
