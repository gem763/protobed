But attacks last month on two major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia led to a surge in exports from Europe to the Mideast Gulf, helping keep margins unseasonably buoyant..\n\n(Graphic - European Light Distillate Cracks: here)\n\nAlso boosting refiners is rising demand for distillates in preparation for the International Maritime Organization\u2019s new maritime fuel rules.\n\n(Graphic - European Middle and Heavy Distillate Cracks: here)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very bullish for products going into next year,\u201d Vitol chief executive Russell Hardy said at an industry event last week.\n\n\u201cThe market is going to be called upon to supply sufficient gasoil and low-sulphur fuel oil. On the flip side, there\u2019s 2 million barrels per day of high-sulphur fuel oil that needs a place to go,\u201d he added.", "description": "U.S. sanctions imposed last month on subsidiaries of vast Chinese shipping fleet Cosco have given an unexpected boost to European refiners as less crude oil from the North Sea and West Africa heads east, traders and analysts said.", "authors": ["Ahmad Ghaddar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441533503&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1GX", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
