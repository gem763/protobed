In the Quinnipiac University poll that came out after the publication of the Mueller report, for example, 54 percent of Americans thought Trump had \u201cattempted to derail or obstruct the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d and 46 percent thought Trump had committed crimes while president, but only 29 percent said Congress should begin the impeachment process.\n\nSo support for impeachment could remain low this time around, too, but it could also be different. A separate YouGov poll conducted Tuesday found that a majority of Americans may either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d support impeachment if Trump \u201csuspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country\u2019s officials to investigate his political rival.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the only evidence to suggest that support for impeachment could increase. Of the five polls from which we have data so far, one is from a high-quality telephone pollster \u2014 Quinnipiac. And their latest poll shows a 5-percentage-point increase in support for impeachment overall and a 12-percentage-point increase among Democrats since they were last asked the question in July.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dhrumil Mehta", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features What-The-First-Few-Post-Ukraine-Polls-Say-About-Impeachment"], "top_image": ""}
