It was a huge game to get out of. I felt like the momentum was with me\u2026 Once I won that game, I felt like that was what set me on my way.\u2019\n\nWawrinka, like Murray is a three-time grand slam winner plagued by injury, will represent a stern test in the final in Antwerp after he overcame Italian teenager Jannik Sinner, dropping just three games in the process.\n\n\u2018Stan\u2019s a brilliant player.
