Controversy has sparked major protests and campaigns in a string of communities across the country.\n\nA Tory source said: 'We now have a significant number of MPs who are unhappy about our stance on fracking. It's a whole range of concerns from not liking the technology full stop to local concerns about the potential impact of campaign groups.' In a letter to Boris Johnson last month, the organisation Frack Free United warned that controversy about the technology could swing the result in as many as 40 marginal constituencies.\n\nThe political pressure to act on the issue intensified after Labour switched to backing a total ban on fracking.\n\nA 'manifesto' by the Conservative Environment Network in the summer said the Government should consider a ban on what it described as an 'unpopular, uneconomic and out-of-date industry'. Polling for the manifesto, which was backed by more than 40 Conservative MPs, found that just 37 per cent of Tory supporters back the technology.\n\nA National Audit Office report this month said public support for fracking 'is low and has reduced over time'.\n\nSupporters of the technology insist that UK regulations are already amongst the tightest in the world. But, despite the UK having massive potential reserves of the gas, just five operators are currently in the early stages of trying to exploit it commercially.\n\nBut Greenpeace welcomed indications that a clampdown was imminent.\n\nA spokesman said: 'If the government has read the science, listened to the huge public opposition and decided to pull the plug on fracking then that should be really welcomed.'", "description": "Fracking for shale gas has been encouraged by successive Conservative prime ministers as a way of reducing the UK's reliance on gas imports and cutting carbon emissions.", "authors": ["Jason Groves Political Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20400674-0-image-a-8_1572475905944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
