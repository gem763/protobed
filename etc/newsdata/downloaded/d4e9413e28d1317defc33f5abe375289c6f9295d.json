REUTERS/Panu Wongcha-um/File Photo\n\nThailand is a major trafficking route for crystal meth manufactured in Myanmar\u2019s Shan and Kachin states, where police say Asian organised crime groups have allied with local pro-government militias and armed rebels to set-up \u201csuper labs\u201d.\n\nThe drug syndicates have distributed the meth across the Asia-Pacific region, from South Korea to New Zealand and most countries in between, authorities say.\n\nSome 18.4 tonnes of crystal meth, also known as ice, was seized in Thailand in 2018, according to preliminary statistics from the country\u2019s Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) reviewed by Reuters. The final data is expected to be released publicly next month. That is up from 5.2 tonnes in 2017 and 1.6 tonnes in 2016. It\u2019s more than treble the amount captured across all of Southeast Asia five years ago.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s illicit labs also pump out tablets of meth mixed with caffeine, commonly know as \u201cyaba\u201d, or crazy pill, in the Thai language. The tablets are popular with low-paid workers in gruelling jobs and poor recreational drug users across Southeast Asia.\n\nThai authorities seized 516 million meth tablets in 2018, more than double the previous year and four-and-a-half times the 114 million pills captured in 2016.\n\nNiyom Termsrisuk, secretary general of the ONCB, told Reuters that, despite the rising seizures, prices for meth are falling, suggesting far more is eluding authorities than being stopped.\n\nThe average price of a meth tablet was 200 baht ($6.33) in 2013. The latest data, for 2017, showed a yaba pill can be bought for as little as 80 baht ($2.50), he said.\n\nBy flooding Thailand and other countries with meth, organised crime groups have \u201cgenerated new users\u201d by enticing them with lower prices, Niyom said. The users then become dependent on the highly addictive drug, creating a bigger market for the product.\n\n\u201c2018 A DISASTER\u201d\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle - which encompasses northern Myanmar and parts of Laos and Thailand - has long been a hub of illicit drug trafficking.\n\nWhile opium cultivation and heroin refining has fallen in the past decade, methamphetamine production has more than filled the breach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say anything other than 2018 was a disaster for the meth supply coming out of Myanmar,\u201d said Jeremy Douglas, the Asia representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies were overwhelmed while \u201chealth authorities are seriously under-resourced and have limited capacity to offer treatment\u201d, he added.\n\nRegional police and analysts told Reuters that organised crime groups exploit the semi-lawless northern Myanmar borderlands, doing deals with the multitude of ethnic armed gangs and state-sponsored militias who control territory there.\n\nThe ONCB\u2019s Niyom said 8 tonnes of crystal meth had been captured en route to southern Thailand and the border with Malaysia in 2018. From there, \u201cit was on its way to other markets\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the past year, police have intercepted boats laden with meth that left the Malaysian city of Penang. Syndicates also use \u201cmotherships\u201d that pick up the drugs in the Andaman Sea and distribute them as far afield as Australia and New Zealand.\n\nMeth from Myanmar has also been found smuggled in shipping containers in the Philippines and Malaysia.\n\nAccording to regional anti-drugs police, who spoke on condition of anonymity, chemists are brought in from Taiwan and China to run the meth labs in Myanmar, while the precursors and lab equipment mostly come from China.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Thai narcotics officials put bags of methamphetamine pills into a bin during the 48th Destruction of Confiscated Narcotics ceremony in Ayutthaya province, Thailand, June 25, 2018.
