Ralph Northam apologized but faced calls for his resignation after a racist photo from his 1984 medical school yearbook surfaced in February. The photo showed a young man in blackface next to someone in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. Northam promptly apologized without saying which person was him. Then a day later, he denied being in the photograph at all, while admitting he wore blackface as Michael Jackson at a dance contest decades ago.\n\nIn Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey apologized in August for wearing blackface years before entering politics.\n\nIn Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also apologized last month after a yearbook photo surfaced showing him in brownface makeup at a 2001 costume party.\n\nThe practice reinforces racial stereotypes and reduces Native Americans, Latinos, African Americans and other people of color based on skin tones and exaggerated physical features, social scientists say.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe headline of this story has been edited to correct \"students\" to \"student.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
