I haven't seen the final season.\"\n\n\"But I know what it took to shoot it,\" he continued. \"And it was hard and everyone put their love and effort into it. And controversy -- I think for us, we knew what we were doing was right, story-wise. And we knew that it was right for the characters because we lived with them for 10 years. So controversy for us didn't really affect us.\"\n\nWhile on hand in the press room, co-creator David Benioff also opened up about the most memorable fan theory -- which came from an unexpected source!\n\n\"Commander Mark Kelly, commander of the space shuttle, had a fan theory that amused us because it was about 90% right, and so he was the one person that we had to put on a straight face and nod in such a way that made him believe he was wrong, because he nailed about 90% of it.\"\n\nSee more from the GoT cast below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'Game of Thrones' Cast Had the Most Fun Reuniting at 2019 Emmys\n\nEmmys 2019: 'Game of Thrones' and 'Fleabag' Win the Night's Top Awards\n\nPeter Dinklage Sets Emmy Record With Fourth Win for 'Game of Thrones'\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The leading man also addressed the pushback the show received.", "authors": ["Scott Baumgartner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XQFnsdADetvFKkUay0zidQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/1b2f35b6914041a5be1399932ec58e78", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
