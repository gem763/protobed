Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nSimplicity, functionality, and outdoor gear designs that still allow the scenery to take center stage. Sounds pretty good, right?\n\nTwo Colorado natives thought so, too.\n\nTopo Designs is a company influenced by childhoods spent in the powerful landscape of the Rocky Mountain West and purposefully lodged at the base of the Colorado Rockies. All of the company's products, from conception to fruition, are marked by their surrounding community and environment.\n\nInspired by the experiences they had outdoors in the dramatic backyard of the West, co-founders Jedd Rose and Mark Hansen set out to make the kind of gear that looked and felt natural in a nature setting, a goal that sounds more intuitive than much of what's currently available on the market might make it seem.\n\nThe backpacks, bags, apparel, and accessories that accompany you into the wild should not hinder your appreciation of it, but should rather reinforce your aims in purchasing them in the first place. In a perfect world, you and your gear should simply meld into the experience.\n\nTrue to that intention, Topo Designs makes pieces that complement the simplicity and calm of the outdoors, without sacrificing utility or style. To achieve this, their bags are designed as crossovers with the strongest characteristics of classic French ski gear and simplistic Japanese daypacks. Each bag is purposeful in detail and aims to maintain a balance between technicality and style.\n\nAs their lives in Colorado helped to emphasize the interconnectedness with nature and community that became their mission, ethos, and aesthetic, it seemed only natural that Rose and Hansen should make their products in the US and base their company out of Colorado.\n\nSo when the time came, their first brick-and-mortar location was built in Denver, and out of modular recycled shipping containers rather than bricks. After all, how do you make sure you never drift from the path you've chosen? By never leaving.\n\nDesigning products for neighbors and with neighbors helps their intentions stay local and organic, even as the brand expands and gains popularity. The way they see it, working with friends and the community has made Topo products what they are: smart, but simple tools that further aid the endeavor of connecting \u2014 with community or nature.\n\nTopo Designs' founders understand that people are starting to favor supporting locally grown companies that have perhaps fewer products, but more of an experience to participate in that outlasts their credit card swipe.\n\nIf any of their company story has appealed to you, check out some of our favorite gear from Topo Designs below.", "description": "Simplicity, functionality, and outdoor gear designs that still allow the scenery to take center stage.
