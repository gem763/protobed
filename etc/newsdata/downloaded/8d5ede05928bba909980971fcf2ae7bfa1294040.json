And John Lewis (pictured) is reducing some items by more than 50 per cent\n\nRichard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, added: \u2018It\u2019s been a dreadful year and the most distressed retail market we\u2019ve seen. Sales of 90 per cent shows panic and it\u2019s damaging to brands.\u2019\n\nThe latest sales figures suggest there is no end in sight for the High Street\u2019s woes.\n\nFigures from the British Retail Consortium show it was the worst September since 1995, when its records began.\n\nSales were down by more than 3 per cent between July and September this year on the same period last year. House of Fraser, which closed six stores last year after it was bought out of administration, offered discounts of up to 70 per cent this week, including a whopping \u00a3750 off a \u00a31,500 Vivienne Westwood coat.\n\nMarks and Spencer was offering up to 90 per cent off at the end of its two-week sale, which finished last week.\n\nIn Uniqlo, where some items are on sale for more than 60 per cent off, staff said: \u2018We\u2019re just constantly in sale mode now. It\u2019s certainly been like that for the last two months.\u2019\n\nAnd staff at Urban Outfitters, where the price of some items were slashed by 75 per cent, said they had a sale on \u2018all the time\u2019.\n\nClive Black, retail expert at Shore Capital, said: \u2018It\u2019s a very tough market. We cut the fat and we\u2019re getting to the skin and bone of the High Street.\u2019", "description": "Debenhams, New Look, Jigsaw and House of Fraser are among the stores slashing prices to tempt shoppers through the door this week.
