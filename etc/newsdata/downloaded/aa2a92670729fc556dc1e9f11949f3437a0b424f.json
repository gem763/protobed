The Syrian Kurdish militia was the only U.S. ally in the campaign that brought down the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nTrump warned Turkey to act with moderation and safeguard civilians. But the barrages of the invasion so far showed little sign of holding back.\n\nIn Syria, residents fled with their belongings loaded into cars, pickup trucks and motorcycle rickshaws, while others escaped on foot. The U.N. refugee agency said tens of thousands were on the move, and aid agencies warned that nearly a half-million people near the border were at risk \u2014 in scenes similar to those from a few years ago, when civilians fled the Islamic State group militants.\n\nThe Turkish ministry statement reported the death of a soldier also said three soldiers were wounded in the action but didn\u2019t provide details. Separately, the ministry said 49 more \u201cterrorists\u201d were \u201cneutralized\u201d in the incursion, in reference to Syrian Kurdish fighters. It said the total number of Kurdish fighters killed so far numbers 277. Those figures could not be independently verified.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish fighters terrorists linked to a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey and says the offensive is necessary for national security.\n\nTurkish officials said the Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into Turkish border towns the past two days, including Akcakale, killing at least six civilians, including a 9-month-old boy and three girls under 15. On the Syrian side, seven civilians and eight Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began, according to activists in Syria.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said the offensive was progressing \u201csuccessfully as planned.\u201d A Kurdish-led group and Syrian activists said that despite the bombardment, Turkish troops had not made much progress on several fronts they had opened. But their claims could not be independently verified.\n\nAs the incursion drew widespread criticism, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the European Union not to call Ankara\u2019s incursion into Syria an \u201cinvasion.\u201d He threatened, as he has in the past, to \u201copen the gates\u201d and let Syrian refugees flood into Europe.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said the military intends to move 30 kilometers (19 miles) into northern Syria and that its operation will last until all \u201cterrorists are neutralized.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.", "description": "AKCAKALE, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Turkish forces pushed deeper into northeastern Syria on Friday, the third day of Ankara's cross-border offensive against Syrian", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/8e1fcd_turkey-us-syria-52214-in-photo-turkish-border-turkey-syria-in-akcakale-sanliurfa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
