And in leaking out select portions from their report in the middle of the night, without even allowing some of the committee's own members to see it, the Republican members are clearly seeking to avoid any fact-checking of their discredited, conspiracy theories.\n\nFallon also noted House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) comments last year saying that the Benghazi panel was put together to bring down Clinton's poll numbers.\n\n\"This report just confirms what Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and even one of Trey Gowdy Harold (Trey) Watson GowdyRising star Ratcliffe faces battle to become Trump's intel chief Cummings announces expansion of Oversight panel's White House personal email probe, citing stonewalling Pelosi says it's up to GOP to address sexual assault allegation against Trump MORE's own former staffers admitted months ago: this Committee's chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave Americans in order to try to attack the Obama administration and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign,\" Fallon said.\n\nAmong the report's new revelations is the notion that Ambassador Chris Stevens, one of the Americans killed, was in Benghazi with the aim of erecting a permanent diplomatic post, to replace the temporary one that came under fire.\n\nMilitary orders also appeared to have gotten lost or misinterpreted on their way down the chain, the report claims.\n\nAnd details were lost about which responsibilities fell to the Pentagon, which were in the hands of the State Department and who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 needed to be evacuated.\n\n\u201cThe response to the attacks suffered from confusion and misinformation circulating between the agencies,\u201d the report claims, \u201cunderscoring that no one effectively took charge of the U.S. government\u2019s response.\u201d\n\nTroops remained motionless for hours after then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta ordered forces to deploy to the scene of the violence.\n\nAt one point, a platoon of U.S. Marines changed into and out of their uniforms four different times as they waited to be deployed, due to changing orders about \u201cthe image that would present\u201d of having uniformed U.S. forces marching through the city.\n\nAdditionally, the Libyan forces that eventually evacuated the surviving Americans from the CIA annex were in fact former loyalists of deposed strongman Moammar Gadhafi and not militia groups with a previous relationship with the U.S.\n\nIn the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks, Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith died when their diplomatic compound came under attack. Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died from mortar fire hours later, at a nearby CIA annex.\n\nScrutiny over the terror attack has dogged the Obama administration for the last four years and in the process has become a byword for scandal on par with Watergate.\n\nCritics suspect the Obama administration of having turned a blind eye to security, failing to come to the victims aid and then misleading the public in the aftermath.\n\nThe episode has become political weight for Clinton in particular. Her presumptive Republican opponent, Donald Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE, has hammered her for \u201cbad judgment\u201d and suggestions that the violence was sparked in protest to an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube. The video was the source of protests elsewhere in the Muslim world, but the Benghazi attacks were spearheaded by a member of a radical Islamist militia.\n\nCommittee Democrats attempted to get out ahead of the report on Monday, by releasing their rebuttal analysis and dozens of interview transcripts a day early.\n\nIn their analysis, Democrats acknowledged that the committee had uncovered additional details about the 2012 violence but maintained that nothing altered the underlying narrative supported by previous investigations.\n\nThe committee\u2019s Tuesday release accomplishes a key goal of Gowdy\u2019s by ensuring it is public before the party nominating conventions next month. The conventions had been an informal deadline for the committee to release its report, and a delay would likely have been seen as the committee inserting itself into the campaign season.\n\n\u201cNow, I simply ask the American people to read this report for themselves, look at the evidence we have collected, and reach their own conclusions,\u201d Gowdy said in a statement on Tuesday morning. \u201cYou can read this report in less time than our fellow citizens were taking fire and fighting for their lives on the rooftops and in the streets of Benghazi.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated at 10:15 a.m.", "description": "The report comes after two years of work and $7 million in expense.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/benghazi_112414getty.jpg", "published_at": "2016-06-28"}
