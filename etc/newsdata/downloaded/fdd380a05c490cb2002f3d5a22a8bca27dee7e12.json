But before you do, you can save $20 by snagging a set of Nintendo Switch game vouchers.\n\nThis offer is for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers only, and it allows you to purchase two fully priced Switch titles for $99.99. (The price would usually be $119.99.) For example, you could use these vouchers to buy Mario Maker 2 and the new Fire Emblem game. They also work on essentially all of Nintendo\u2019s games, like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and more, including those that will be released in the near future.\n\nIf this sounds like a deal that you want to take advantage of, do so quickly. Nintendo will stop selling vouchers on Wednesday, July 31st. Once you\u2019ve bought them, however, you can use them up to a year from the original purchase date.\n\nDaily Steals is cutting the price of the Beats Solo 3 Wireless on-ear headphones for readers of The Verge. You can usually find these for around $160, but they are $119.99 if you use the offer code VERGEBEATS3 at checkout. Like Apple\u2019s AirPods, the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones contain Apple\u2019s W1 wireless chip, which allows for a fast, easy connection to all of your Apple devices, be it a MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, iPhone, or iPad.\n\nThese are open-box models in new condition that are sold to Daily Steals directly from Apple. They are covered by Apple for 90 days. If an issue pops up after that but within the first year of ownership, you can contact Daily Steals with your order number for support.\n\nThe Amazon Fire TV Cube is $59.99 at Woot. This is the previous-generation model, but the only thing that\u2019s different from the current model is the type of remote that is included in the box. You\u2019ll get the first-generation Alexa Voice remote, not the newer one bundled with the current Fire TV Cube that can control most IR-enabled devices. If that\u2019s not a bother for you, this streaming box is a good fit with a 4K HDR television, and it can act like an Echo smart speaker with its far-field microphones.\n\nThe Lenovo Legion Y545 gaming laptop is $949 at Newegg (usually $1,399). It comes with 15.6-inch FHD IPS LED display, 9th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti discrete graphics card, 16GB RAM, and a 128GB PCIe SSD + 1TB HDD.\n\nFor reference, the GTX 1660 Ti is slightly more powerful than the previous-generation GTX 1060, and it\u2019s roughly 5 percent slower than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 2060, depending on the game. My colleague Sean Hollister wrote a post that goes into much more detail about what this GPU is capable of in relation to Nvidia\u2019s more powerful options.", "description": "Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can get $20 off of two fully priced Switch games until July 31st.
