(Erin O. Smith/Chattanooga Times Free Press/AP)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday a plan to dramatically reduce its reliance on animal testing to assess the dangers of chemicals, pledging to end nearly all experiments on mammals by 2035.\n\nA directive from EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler says the agency will scale back requests for and funding of mammal studies by 30 percent by 2025; after 2035, any use of such tests will require the approval of the agency\u2019s administrator. The memo also commits $4.25 million in grants to five universities for developing alternative experiments that \u201cwill minimize and hopefully eliminate the need for animal testing,\u201d Wheeler told reporters.\n\nWheeler signed the directive while flanked by representatives of animal protection groups that have long campaigned against animal testing. Public health and environmental groups, however, expressed concern about the change.\n\nWheeler, a former coal lobbyist who has championed the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of environmental regulations, described the subject as one of personal importance to him. Wheeler\u2019s staff gave reporters copies of a 1987 column he had written for his college newspaper that called for decreasing animal testing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of alternatives between computer modeling to in vitro testing that we can use to replace animal testing,\u201d Wheeler said Tuesday. \u201cOftentimes we find that the animal testing \u2026 has perhaps misled us on the science, and there are better alternatives for testing the impacts of chemicals on people.\u201d\n\nThe EPA\u2019s move comes as Congress is increasing its scrutiny of federal agencies over animal tests.\n\nIn April, the Agriculture Department ended controversial experiments on cats. in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration halted a nicotine study on squirrel monkeys and Congress passed legislation prohibiting most uses of dogs in medical research at the Department of Veterans Affairs. VA has since reduced but declined to eliminate the tests, and the agency\u2019s inspector general is now investigating the experiments at the urging of lawmakers.\n\nThe EPA performs tests on animals and in some cases requires such tests from chemical companies. Agency labs use as many as 20,000 rabbits, mice, fish and rats each year, according to Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the White Coat Waste Project, a three-year-old organization that has helped galvanize bipartisan opposition to federally funded animal testing.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s new plan amounts to \u201cwhat we believe is the most comprehensive and aggressive plan in U.S. history to cut wasteful taxpayer-funded animal testing,\u201d Goodman told reporters Tuesday.\n\nWheeler described the directive as a continuation of efforts that accelerated in 2016, under the Obama administration, when the Toxic Substances Control Act was amended to require the EPA to reduce its reliance on animal testing.\n\nWhile such developments have been praised by animal advocates, they have been assailed by some researchers and public health and environmental groups that say animal tests remain critical for determining risks to people.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council called Wheeler\u2019s directive an \u201cirresponsible plan\u201d that will depend on testing methods that \u201cmay not be sufficient for testing all chemicals.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhasing out foundational scientific testing methods can make it much harder to identify toxic chemicals \u2014 and protect human health,\u201d Jennifer Sass, senior scientist for the council\u2019s Healthy People and Thriving Communities program, said in a statement. \u201cOnce again, the Trump administration appears to be working on behalf of the chemical industry and not the public. Congress should bar the agency from blindfolding itself.\u201d\n\nInternal EPA communications obtained earlier this year by the Intercept, a news website, show that the agency communicated with chemical companies including Dow Chemical about collaborating on alternative testing methods.\n\nWheeler said Tuesday that he had \u201cnot been lobbied by a single chemical company\u201d on the topic, which he said was \u201cof long-standing interest to me personally.\u201d When he was young, he said, his mother told him about \u201cthe ethical problems\u201d of animal testing, and he added that one of his sisters is a zoologist and another a veterinarian.\n\nWheeler said he felt confident that the 16 years between now and 2035 would provide enough time for scientists to develop effective non-animal tests.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote this article back in 1987, I didn\u2019t think we were that far away from banning animal testing,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m doing this today is it\u2019s been 30 years, and we haven\u2019t made enough progress.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAnimal welfare law enforcement has faded under Trump\n\nEPA chief will focus on ocean trash, not climate change, at upcoming global summit\n\nUSDA is turning lab cats into cannibals by forcing them to eat feline meat, watchdog says", "description": "The new plan, which calls for the elimination of nearly all experiments on mammals by 2035, was cheered by animal rights groups but criticized by some environmental and public health organizations.", "authors": ["Karin Brulliard", "Reporter", "Editor For Animalia", "September At Pm", "Karin Brulliard Is A National Reporter Who Writes About Animals.
