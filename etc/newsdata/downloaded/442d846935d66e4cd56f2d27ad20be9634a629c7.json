Ultra-nationalist parties have protested, calling for him to be re-imprisoned, while political figures have condemned the judiciary for granting him parole.\n\nSpeaking to journalists as he left the detention centre, Palfreeman said he wouldn\u2019t try to flee.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid because I believe that the Bulgarian people will protect me like they have done over the past 12 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBulgarians have always helped me, not Australians.\u201d\n\nHe said Bulgarian authorities had confiscated his passport an hour before he was told he was being released.\n\n\u201cForty police officers went through my cell,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took my Australian passport. That was very strange. Some high-ranking officer told me I had no right to a passport since I\u2019m banned from leaving the country.\u201d\n\nThe Australian said he did not know where he would stay in Sofia, but was \u201chappy\u201d to be at liberty. \u201cOf course I am happy. I am out of prison today, for the second time. I hope everything will be over quickly.\u201d\n\nPalfreeman, from Sydney, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years for fatally stabbing a 23-year-old law student, Andrei Monov, in Sofia during a night out in December 2007. He was also convicted of attempted murder of Monov\u2019s associate Antoan Zahariev, who was injured.\n\nThe Australian has consistently maintained he acted in self-defence in the early hours of 28 December 2007, after intervening to prevent Monov and a group of more than a dozen friends from attacking two Roma men in the city centre.\n\nHis lawyer, Kalin Angelov, has released security camera footage of the brawl, which Palfreeman said exonerated him and demonstrated clearly his stabbing of Monov occurred after the group turned on him.\n\nThen 21, Palfreeman pleaded not guilty to murdering Monov \u2013 he was carrying a large butterfly knife belonging to a friend with which he stabbed the student in the side of his chest \u2013 but was found guilty of murder. The conviction and sentence were upheld by higher courts. Palfreeman said he had been carrying the knife because he\u2019d previously experienced violence in Sofia.\n\nWhile his unexpected parole in September was greeted with elation by his family and supporters in Australia it was condemned by senior politicians in Bulgaria, including the dead man\u2019s father, and divided the country\u2019s legal fraternity.\n\nMonov\u2019s father, Hristo, a former MP for the Bulgarian Socialist party, said the court had made a mockery of Bulgaria\u2019s people. \u201cThe three judges \u2026 will carry a moral disgrace on their own,\u201d he said.\n\nUltra-nationalist political parties marched on Sofia\u2019s Palace of Justice demanding Palfreeman be re-imprisoned, and the country\u2019s prosecutor general launched a highly irregular appeal to the supreme court of cassation, the highest court in the land, for his parole to be overturned.", "description": "Australian convicted of stabbing a student to death in 2007 ordered to remain in Sofia", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32bdc11a9b41f89fdad3e7432d8d4a9825802982/62_54_3371_2022/master/3371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80dd52019c3dcd6d13e04c694653a622", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
