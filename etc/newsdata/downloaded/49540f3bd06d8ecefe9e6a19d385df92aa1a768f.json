(and Environs)", "language": "en", "text": "Asheville, N. C. \u2014 with its lively arts district, locavore food movement and over-the-top, Gilded Age mansion \u2014 attracts hordes of leaf peepers as soon as the temperatures start to drop. But a two-hour drive up the spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the less-visited Boone, a gem of a college town in the heart of Southern Appalachia, offers many of the same attractions, and plenty more besides. Come for the fresh air and majestic mountain views, but stick around to sample the local brews, enjoy live music and admire the fine crafts of the area\u2019s talented artisans. The Blue Ridge Parkway is well worth the small detour for its historic sites and sweeping overlooks, while nearby Blowing Rock \u2014 a genteel resort town long favored by well-to-do Southern tourists \u2014 offers fine dining, swank boutiques and one of the most famous views in the state.\n\nFriday\n\n1) 3 p.m. High country hike\n\nThe forested bluffs of Elk Knob State Park might have been turned into a housing development had it not been for a group of concerned citizens who joined with the Nature Conservancy to purchase the land and hand it over to the state government in 2003. Now protected, the park\u2019s 4,200 acres are home to wild turkeys, bobcats and brown bear, as well as flame azaleas, orchids and the rare Gray\u2019s lily. Get a close-up look at this high-mountain habitat along the 1.9-mile Summit Trail \u2014 a steady, well-marked climb that leads you to the top of Elk Knob (5,520 feet) and rewards you with a panorama of the rolling Blue Ridge Mountains. The views are especially radiant in the first half of October, when the fiery autumn colors at this elevation usually reach their peak. On a clear day, you can catch a glimpse of Mount Mitchell, the highest mountain east of the Mississippi.\n\n2) 7 p.m. Brews and tunes\n\nSo hard to reach were the mountainous counties of northwestern North Carolina that lowlanders early in the state\u2019s history often called them \u201cthe lost provinces,\u201d and the nickname stuck into the first half of the 20th century. Modern highways have solved the access problem, but the old moniker has been embraced by the owners of Lost Province, a popular brewery-cum-restaurant that opened in downtown Boone in 2014. The vaulted wooden interior welcomes friendly crowds of locals and visitors, who come to dine on the wood-fired pizza, enjoy the house-brewed beers and catch some live music (bluegrass, classic rock, folksy singer-songwriter sessions) on a Friday night. Dinner and drinks for two, about $50.", "description": "A lively Appalachian college town, a genteel resort spot and stops along the Blue Ridge Parkway offer a colorful fall weekend of music, crafts, beer and majestic views.", "authors": ["Paige Mcclanahan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/travel/03Hours-Boone-NC4/merlin_161146428_74643bbd-8ff2-4742-8cdd-80f5d8a4a32a-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
