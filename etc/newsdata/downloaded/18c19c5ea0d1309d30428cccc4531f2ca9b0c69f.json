In short, a DNS server will translate a domain name to an IP address to show you whatever site you\u2019re trying to access. But because this process is generally unencrypted, it can potentially expose where you\u2019re headed on the web to those who know how to look. And that, of course, includes ISPs.\n\nIn a screenshot of the lobbying presentation, Comcast claims that should Google and Mozilla activate DoH, \u201cthis feature would by default route all DNS traffic from Chrome and Android users to Google Public DNS, thus centralizing a majority of worldwide DNS data with Google.\u201d The document further claims that this \u201cunilateral centralization of DNS raises serious policy issues relating to cybersecurity, privacy, antitrust, national security and law enforcement, network performance and service quality (including 5G), and others.\u201d Basically, the slide lists a whole host of boogie man buzzwords seemingly intended to scare the shit out of policymakers.\n\nAmong other claims in the lobbying document, the presentation also asserts that if Google encrypts browser data, \u201cISPs and other enterprises will be precluded from seeing and resolving their users\u2019 DNS.\u201d But multiple parties who spoke with Motherboard say that is not the case. Indeed, Google states in a September blog post about its plans for implementing DNS-over-HTTPS (aka DoH) in Chrome 79 that the experiment will be carried out \u201cin collaboration with DNS providers who already support DoH, with the goal of improving our mutual users\u2019 security and privacy by upgrading them to the DoH version of their current DNS service.\u201d Google reiterated its goals in a statement sent to Gizmodo.\n\n\u201cGoogle has no plans to centralize or change people\u2019s DNS providers to Google by default. Any claim that we are trying to become the centralised encrypted DNS provider is inaccurate,\u201d a Google spokesperson said. Rather, the company said that it\u2019s \u201cexperimenting,\u201d as it noted in the September blog, with new methods for ensuring \u201conline privacy and security while maintaining existing content filtering and parental controls.\u201d In any event, Google stressed that its DoH experiment won\u2019t be enabled the \u201cvast majority\u201d of its users. Folks can also opt-out of the experiment by disabling the Chrome flag here: chrome://flags/#dns-over-https.\n\nMozilla, for its part, only plans to enable the protocol for a small percentage of its users\u2014roughly 5 per cent\u2014before it pauses to assess the impact. If the feedback is good and there are no major issues, the company will introduce a wider rollout with the goal of reaching 100 per cent of its U.S. users. Like Google, Mozilla said that the lobbying deck was \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoH is really intended to make it harder for DNS providers to collect or monetise that data or build a profile about users,\u201d the company\u2019s senior director of trust and safety Marshall Erwin told Gizmodo by phone. \u201cUnsurprisingly, that\u2019s not something that ISPs are excited about. Hopefully, this is adding a protection, in some cases from your local ISP that might be seeking to build a profile about you. So as a result, we\u2019ve seen a pretty massive lobbying effort to try to prevent us from deploying those protections.\u201d\n\nThere are legitimate concerns about the implementation for DoH, such as that it could allow browsing to sites otherwise blocked by an ISP and parental controls, raising concerns among critics about child safety or other illicit activity. According to a Google spokesperson, however, the company\u2019s \u201cproposal for DoH enables secure connections and does not change a user\u2019s DNS, so all existing filters and controls remain intact. Furthermore, there is no change to how DNS providers work with law enforcement in accordance with court orders.\u201d\n\nComcast did not immediately return a request for comment. It did, however, publish a lengthy blog post following Motherboard\u2019s story claiming that it doesn\u2019t track where users go on the internet or \u201csell information that identifies who you are to anyone,\u201d including a user\u2019s \u201clocation data when you use our Xfinity Mobile service.\u201d\n\nBut it does, to be sure, use your data. The company added: \u201cWe study our network data to assess how the network is performing, understand trends, stay ahead of capacity demands, and build, test, and improve our products and services. We do that with only a small sample of network data that is aggregated and never identifiable to any customer.\u201d\n\nPlus, while Comcast says that it deletes DNS queries it collects, Comcast says that it does so \u201cevery 24 hours except in very specific cases where we need to research a security or network performance issue, protect against security threats, or comply with a valid legal request.\u201d Comcast does, however, claim it doesn\u2019t sell that information or use it for marketing or advertising.\n\nComcast\u2019s response to Motherboard\u2019s reporting, however, did not stop with a mere blog post. According to a follow-up report, the company engaged in a PR cleanup that can charitably be described as aggressive. According to the site, Comcast sent it to four Motherboard writers, reporters at other publications, and at least eight other individuals who tweeted a link to the story.
