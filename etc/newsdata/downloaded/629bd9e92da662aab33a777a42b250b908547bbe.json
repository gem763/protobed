He then trotted out for what was not only his first start of the preseason, but his last game action until further notice.\n\nHe made it count.\n\nHaskins looked composed and made steady plays from the pocket in Washington\u2019s 20-7 loss to the Baltimore Ravens at FedEx Field. The 22-year-old went 10-of-17 for 104 yards and a touchdown.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redskins named veteran Case Keenum their starting quarterback over Haskins. Washington has been pleased with the first-rounder\u2019s development, but felt Haskins needs further work before he\u2019s ready to lead. Haskins, after all, was drafted 15th overall after starting just one season at Ohio State.\n\nOn Thursday, Haskins led a number of solid drives, including an impressive eight-play, 75-yard series in which the quarterback helped the Redskins march down the field in the first quarter. Haskins demonstrated a lot of what stood out as a Buckeye especially \u2014 standing poised in the pocket, making quick decisions and delivering the ball right on target.\n\nTo help set up that touchdown, Haskins found tight end J.P. Holtz for a 24-yard gain to put the Redskins in the red zone. That throw, in particular, was one of Haskins\u2018 best of the evening. After catching a low snap, Haskins quickly scanned the field, noticed a free blitzing safety and remained calm to find an open Holtz.\n\nOne play later, Haskins scrambled outside the pocket to lead Steven Sims to a seven-yard touchdown. Coming out of the draft, Haskins was knocked for not being able to make plays outside the pocket, but the quarterback has gradually improved upon this throughout the summer.\n\nHaskins also did something Thursday he had rarely done in other preseason games: He was able to establish a rhythm. On the Redskins\u2019 scoring drive, Haskins completed four straight attempts on gains of 14, 25, 24 and 7. In general, he completed seven of his first nine passes.\n\nAfter the touchdown, the Redskins would fail to score again with Haskins\u2014 though the offense did the signal-caller no favors. In the second quarter, wide receiver Cam Sims, fighting for a roster spot, dropped back-to-back passes \u2014 leading to a 49-yard punt from Tress Way. Haskins also had a 21-yard strike wiped out when Geron Christian was called for holding just before halftime.\n\nIt should be noted, of course, Haskins performed well against second-and-third teamers. Both teams sat their starters and key backups.\n\nStill, Haskins needed the reps \u2014 and in four contests, the 22-year-old played at least two quarters in each. That\u2019s a valuable experience, especially since moving forward, the Redskins will turn to Keenum. Haskins won\u2019t receive many reps during practice in the regular season and it will be up to continue his development in the background.\n\nHaskins took advantage of the opportunities presented to him this preseason. Now, it\u2019ll be up to him to do the same again with the regular season right around the corner.\n\nHere are some other non-Haskins takeaways:\n\nSmaller Sims steps up\n\nCam Sims might have not had his best night with two drops, but Steven Sims made the most of his final game. An undrafted free agent out of Kansas, the 5-foot-10 slot receiver has impressed the Redskins\u2019 coaching staff with his ability to create separation. He did so again against the Ravens \u2014 diving to haul in Haskins\u2018 7-yard touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nSteven Sims also came up big on special teams, returning a kickoff for 41 yards to give the Redskins good field position with under four minutes left in the first half. It will still be a long shot for Steven Sims to make the final 53-man roster, but he made a good case for the practice squad (assuming he clears waivers).\n\nOutside linebacker depth in trouble\n\nOutside linebacker Cassanova McKinzy left Thursday\u2019s game with a concussion \u2014 which potentially has a bigger impact on the rest of the roster. McKinzy figured to be the Redskins\u2019 fourth outside linebacker heading into Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles. But if McKinzy is unavailable, will Washington suddenly keep a fifth outside linebacker, so they have four healthy players at the position in Philadelphia?\n\nIf they decide that, the Redskins could keep one less player at a different position. Ultimately McKinzy\u2019s concussion could ultimately cost someone a job \u2014 if not him, then somebody else.\n\nMontez Sweat plays for some reason\n\nThe night\u2019s biggest surprise occurred when outside linebacker Montez Sweat started the game \u2014 a somewhat curious decision given the first-rounder projects to start against the Eagles. Sweat, though, played for one series and seemingly exited the game uninjured. The Redskins will gladly take that, considering it could have been a disaster otherwise.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
