(TIFF)\n\nOne film Wente attended at TIFF and recommends is Blood Quantum by Jeff Barnaby, which is set in a zombie apocalypse world, where the only people immune to the plague are the Mi'kmaq.\n\n\"I fell in love with [zombie films] when I was a kid \u2026 one of the reasons I've loved and obsessed over them is George Romero could use zombies as an allegory for what he really wanted to make movies about, which was politics and the social challenges of his day,\" said Wente.\n\n\"For me, that's what Jeff Barnaby's done, he's returned politics to the zombie movie \u2026 lots of people will just love it as a zombie movie \u2026 I will love it as a movie deeply about us and our history here.\"\n\nAnother film on Wente's list of ones to watch is Zacharias Kunuk's One Day in the Life of Noah Piugattuk. Set in 1961, the film follows an Inuk hunter who faces pressures from the Canadian government to move into permanent housing, send his kids to government school, and give up their traditional way of life.\n\n\"What I love about this film and all of Zach's work is they're lived in \u2014 it's hard to separate his movies from life,\" said Wente.\n\n\"I think his cinema lives in a way that other cinema doesn't \u2014 it lives in the cultural reclamation, the language preservation. It lives in the stories.\"", "description": "This year at the Toronto International Film Festival, there are more Indigenous films screening than ever before \u2014 13 to be exact.
