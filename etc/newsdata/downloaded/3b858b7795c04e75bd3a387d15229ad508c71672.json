There must be the maximum respect. Today I was treated well and wasn\u2019t insulted, other times it hasn\u2019t happened like that and it\u2019s not nice.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time the Sardinian club\u2019s supporters have targeted an opposition player, with Everton\u2019s Moise Kean suffering similar treatment when he played against Cagliari for Juventus last season and both Blaise Matuidi and Sulley Muntari having previously suffered racist abuse. Cagliari escaped punishment over Kean after the Italian Football Federation ruled the chants had \u201can objectively limited relevance\u201d.\n\nLautaro Mart\u00ednez had earlier opened the scoring in the 27th minute before the hosts levelled through Jo\u00e3o Pedro five minutes after the break. Inter are now top of Serie A on six points after two rounds along with Torino and the champions, Juventus.\n\nElsewhere Luis Alberto struck the equaliser as Lazio claimed a 1-1 draw against Roma in a lively derby, also in Serie A. Roma, for whom Chris Smalling was an unused substitute, went ahead with a penalty from Aleksandar Kolarov after 17 minutes following a handball by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Nicolo Zaniolo also hit a post for Roma.\n\nCiro Immobile and Joaquin Correa both hit the woodwork as Lazio pushed for a leveller and it eventually arrived when Alberto struck just before the hour. Lazio finished strongly with Marco Parolo hitting the crossbar and Manuel Lazzari having what would have been a late winner disallowed for offside.\n\n\u201cThere are inevitably regrets, because we had so many chances and you have to win games like that,\u201d Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi said. \u201cWe could have used a bit more luck. But we played great football.\u201d", "description": "Antonio Conte has said Italian supporters must \u2018improve\u2019 after Romelu Lukaku was subjected to racist chanting on Sunday night in Internazionale\u2019s win over Cagliari", "authors": ["Ed Aarons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c15992e861f121f8ddc3caaac20a6cebb25540/0_53_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe4bcbf481ad472ef56864921d5b4d10"}
