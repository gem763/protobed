(Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty)\n\nAs impressive as making it up both 29,029-foot Everest and 28,251-foot K2 without oxygen is in general, it was even more impressive this year with regard to the latter as avalanches, unpredictable snow slides and bad weather forced nearly 90 percent of the climbers who tried to summit the frigid mountain on the China\u2013Pakistan border to turn back.\n\n\u201cThere were about 200 climbers on the mountain between Sherpa and Pakistani high-altitude workers and foreign climbers,\u201d Ballinger, who also guides trips up Everest for his company Alpenglow Expeditions, tells InsideHook. \u201cAnd 170 or so of them left in that third week of July when conditions looked really dangerous on the mountain with really high avalanche conditions. We were pretty determined to stay and to try to be patient and just give things time. And it worked out.\u201d\n\nPrior to that final ascent by Ballinger, Perez and the other three members of their team (two Nepali Sherpas and one Ecuadorian guide), they had spent the better part of July climbing on the mountain, getting to know the route and acclimatizing (the process of building red blood cells so you can survive at progressively higher altitudes).\n\nThe route which 43-year-old Ballinger picked combined both technical rock as well as ice climbing and also required going through something called the Bottleneck, an hourglass-shaped gully with about 50 degrees of steepness.\n\nPictures Adrian Ballinger took during his trip up K2. (Adrian Ballinger)\n\nThough it\u2019s regarded as the fastest way to the top of K2, going through the Bottleneck is also the deadliest because there\u2019s a 400-foo-tall icy cliff, called a serac, sitting above it which dropping chunks of ice on a daily basis that are anywhere from the size of a microwave to a small house.\n\nAs Ballinger saw firsthand, every single piece of that falling ice has to slide down through the hourglass shape of the Bottleneck.\n\n\u201cThis is the type of risk that I personally hate,\u201d Ballinger says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely random. It doesn\u2019t matter how talented you are as a climber or how much experience you have. If you\u2019re there the wrong moment of the day, then you get hit by the ice and it kills you. I lost a good friend there in 2008. Just in the past 10 years, there have been 20 deaths there. I knew going into it that it was dangerous and there was a big risk.\u201d\n\nPrior to taking it, Ballinger discussed that risk with his family, girlfriend, and best climbing friends. Ultimately, he decided it was one worth taking.\n\nThe thing about big mountains that has inspired me since I was a really young kid is the unknown of the challenge.\n\nBallinger had plenty of time to ponder whether or not he made the right call as he was under the serac for about six hours because of how slow he was climbing due to the lack of oxygen. (People on oxygen typically climb through the Bottleneck in less than two hours.)\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely more dangerous than I thought,\u201d Ballinger says. \u201cYou\u2019re walking between blocks that have fallen in the previous days so there\u2019s no doubting whether the thing is dangerous or not, or active or not, because there\u2019s debris all around you. Six hours is a long time to think about your mortality and whether the decision you made was worth it or not. As it worked out, we all got through that day and we\u2019re all still here. But it was a really intense place for me. It was more dangerous than I expected.\u201d\n\nSo why did Ballinger opt to make an already potentially deadly climb even more dangerous by doing it sans oxygen?\n\n\u201cThe thing about big mountains that has inspired me since I was a really young kid is the unknown of the challenge,\u201d Ballinger says. \u201cThat you were going to be forced to push yourself physically, mentally and emotionally beyond your limits and that there was going to be real risk involved. The mountain really could kill you because you are at or beyond your limits. I\u2019m genetically lucky enough that if I climb with supplemental oxygen, I don\u2019t reach those limits. I feel quite comfortable. I can go to a mountain like K2 or Everest and be very confident that I can summit with oxygen and get back down. So I started trying to climb the mountains without supplemental oxygen.\u201d\n\nPictures Adrian Ballinger took during his trip up K2. (Adrian Ballinger)\n\nNaturally, after Ballinger was able to conquer Everest, K2 was next.\n\n\u201cOnce I summited Everest without oxygen, which took me two years and really pushed me and was an unbelievably difficult thing for me, I was interested in trying the second-tallest mountain,\u201d Ballinger says. \u201cK2 has similar altitude challenges but also added real true technical, technically difficult climbing to the mix.\u201d\n\nHaving climbed both, Ballinger is one of only a handful of people who can compare summiting K2 to reaching Everest\u2019s peak.\n\n\u201cEverest is 800 feet higher than K2 and it was really in those last 800 feet that my body and brain were completely destroyed to the point where I was blacked out for more than half of my summit day on Everest,\u201d Ballinger says. \u201cThat last 800 feet was the most dangerous and scary thing I\u2019ve ever done. Had I not had a great team around me of Sherpas and friends, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be having this conversation with you today. It was much, much more difficult, like so much more difficult. It probably took me almost a year to recover physically from that because I had lost so much muscle. I can feel already that won\u2019t be the case with K2. I think it\u2019ll be a matter of three or four months to get back to where I was. With that said, K2 felt more dangerous because of the risks on summit day and the random nature of them.\u201d\n\nNow that Ballinger \u2014 who dropped from 148 pounds down to 127 during his K2 trip \u2014 is back on the ground and can reflect on his accomplishment, he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll ever be going back to the top \u2014 at least without oxygen.\n\n\u201cRight now, actually truly looking back at it, I\u2019m not sure it was worth it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was sort of imagining if I got wiped out by a block of ice going under the Bottleneck and ended up on a puffy cloud looking down at the world \u2026 I think maybe there\u2019s too much to miss. There\u2019s too much I love in my life and that brief euphoria on the summit of K2, I\u2019m not yet sure whether it\u2019s worth the high risks of not coming home. Over 60 years of climbing since 1950 when K2 was first climbed, one in five people are killed. When you climb without oxygen, that ratio goes up to almost one in two and a half. And those numbers are very real. I\u2019m so proud. I worked so hard for this. But I also recognize how big a part of that success came from luck. And luck is fickle, right?\u201d", "description": "On July 24th, Adrian Ballinger became the fourth American in history to summit both K2 and Mount Everest without using oxygen.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/d8d035ab-0a7e-4183-9cff-1154e570d32e-e1568132667120.jpg?fit=936%2C624", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
