Gendler/STScI/AURA/AP)\n\nReady to escape?\n\nTime travel and teleportation aren\u2019t options (yet).\n\nMeanwhile, reading is probably your best option \u2014 and reading about space is even better.\n\nNASA might not come to mind when you think of which book to read next, but the space agency offers dozens of free e-books about space, science, aeronautics and the history of exploration.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about the history of space travel, check out books on the history of the Hubble Telescope, NASA\u2019s research facilities and the space shuttle program.\n\nThere are more esoteric histories, too: \u201cEmblems of Exploration,\u201d for example, looks at the history of the NASA logo and those of its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and \u201cRockets and People, Volume 1\u201d is the memoir of Boris Chertok, a Russian who designed rockets for the Soviet Union\u2019s space program.\n\nAeronautics are well represented in the collection, too.\n\nKeep your eyes out for books about the North American X-15, a rocket-powered research aircraft; the sonic boom; and even influential aerospace failures.\n\nThe collection also includes books about NASA itself, and specific guides for researchers looking to conduct experiments aboard the International Space Station.\n\nThe e-books open up the agency\u2019s hood and make e-readers, smartphone screens and computers feel a bit more Space Age, so to speak.\n\nThey\u2019re available in formats that work with Nooks, Kindles and other platforms, or just as PDFs.\n\nVisit NASA.gov/connect/ebooks to see the full collection.\n\nRead more\n\nSounds from space can be heard on NASA site\n\nHow did NASA put men on the moon?
