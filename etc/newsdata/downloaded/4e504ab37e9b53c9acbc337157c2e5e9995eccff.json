It can be stronger and more lethal than heroin and is responsible for tens of thousands of American drugs deaths each year.\n\nAmid the latest round of tariff increases between the two countries last month, Trump blasted China in a Twitter thread in which he vowed to order all postal carriers to \u201cSEARCH FOR & REFUSE all deliveries of fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!).\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Xi said this would stop - it didn\u2019t,\u201d Trump added, referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump said is completely groundless and untrue,\u201d Liu Yuejin, the narcotics commission\u2019s vice commissioner, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nIn a sweeping change in May, China began regulating all fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances with the aim of curbing illegal drug trafficking. No fentanyl smuggling cases have been discovered between the U.S. and China since the new measures were implemented, Liu said.\n\nYet law enforcement officials in Virginia said last week that China was linked to a seizure of enough cheap fentanyl to kill 14 million people. One of the 39 people charged in the multi-state drug ring is accused of ordering fentanyl from a vendor in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cThe illicit fentanyl that\u2019s coming in, the vast majority is from China and a lot of it is coming in through the mails,\u201d G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said at a news conference.\n\nLiu noted Tuesday that U.S. fentanyl deaths continue to rise despite increasingly strict controls on the Chinese side, which he said was an indication that the drugs were not coming from China.\n\nLiu also accused \u201ca few politicians\u201d in the U.S. of misleading the American public on China\u2019s work to help the U.S. with its opioid crisis. Chinese and U.S. authorities are working together to handle drug crimes, he said, adding that cooperation on fentanyl has no bearing on ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries.\n\nTrump complained about China\u2019s alleged inaction on fentanyl as part of a four-tweet thread last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property and ordering U.S. companies to \u201cimmediately start looking for an alternative to China.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press videojournalist Sam McNeil in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China said Tuesday that it's not the source of the fentanyl that's killing Americans, contrary to President Trump's recent tweets blaming China for the drug deaths.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Yanan Wang", "Fu Ting"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/china_us_fentanyl_44178_c0-477-5000-3392_s1770x1032.jpg?d4a036ef0a54232349672783dce2b67f1676bbfb"}
