Because he\u2019s its greatest asset", "language": "en", "text": "You\u2019re on watch world leaders. Tweet out something that violates Twitter\u2019s terms and conditions and you\u2019re going to be put on the naughty step. Or rather, your tweet will be put on the naughty step. #playnicenow\n\nIf it violates Twitter\u2019s rules but there is a \u201cclear public interest value to keeping the Tweet on the service\u201d it will be placed behind a notice that \u201cprovides context about the violation\u201d but allows people to click through and see it all the same.\n\nThey just won\u2019t be able to like, or retweet it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOf course, any accounts that promote terrorism, incite violence against individuals, post someone\u2019s intimate photos or personal details, encourage self-harm or child sexual exploitation, will be subject to disciplinary action. Even if they\u2019re the property of the leader of the free world or his rivals.\n\nOtherwise, well: \u201cWhen it comes to the actions of world leaders on Twitter, we recognise that this is largely new ground and unprecedented. We understand the desire for our decisions to be \u2018yes/no\u2019 binaries, but it\u2019s not that simple. The actions we take and policies we develop will set precedent around online speech and we owe it to the people we serve to be deliberate and considered in what we do.\u201d #yeahyeahyeah\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been hiding under a rock for the past three years or so you\u2019ll be aware of the driving force behind Twitter\u2019s blog post setting this out.\n\nIt\u2019s the continuing controversy over some of the more incendiary outpourings of the Tweeter in chief, Donald Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, waded into the debate with a call on the company to suspend his account.\n\nIt followed his tweeting: \u201c....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews\u201d.\n\nHarris declared: \u201cWhen this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.\u201d\n\nBut this was hardly the first such bellicose outpouring from the president. Nor will it be the last, especially with what looks set to be the nastiest presidential election since, well, the last one looming.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to enforce our rules judiciously and impartially. In doing so, we aim to provide direct insight into our enforcement decision-making, to serve public conversation, and protect the public\u2019s right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account,\u201d said Twitter in its response.\n\nI\u2019ll give you 1000-1 against on Twitter using those rules, any rules, to rein or hold Trump to any sort of account. It\u2019s simply not in its interests to do so.\n\nTrump\u2019s Twitter feed is a nuclear-powered controversy generation machine with global reach. Not a week goes by without something he tweets sparking a firestorm. And those firestorms generate clicks, and those clicks generate profit.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that we\u2019re operating in an increasingly complex and polarised political culture,\u201d says Twitter.\n\nThat paragraph is astonishing for either its lack of self-awareness or for its deep cynicism.\n\nTwitter, and its social media peers, have played a major role in the creation of that climate, which explains why they\u2019re coming under pressure from more thoughtful politicians who are increasingly alarmed at the results.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Twitter\u2019s shares have come off a bit of late but they\u2019re still trading at around $40 (\u00a331) having staged quite the rally since they were languishing at around $14 early in 2017.\n\nThe second-quarter results smashed through Wall Street\u2019s estimates and, while there have been worries expressed about how its slimmed-down ad strategy might impact on the near term, the concerns about the viability of the business that were once commonplace have died down.\n\nTrump has helped no end. He is in many ways the business\u2019s greatest asset. I\u2019d be amazed if any of his tweets ended up on the naughty step. There\u2019s no way Twitter\u2019s going to cramp his style.", "description": "You\u2019re on watch world leaders.
