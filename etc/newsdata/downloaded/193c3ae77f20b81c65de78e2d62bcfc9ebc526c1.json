The race has four distances \u2013 83km, 160km, 30km, 53km \u2013 some of which were available as a relay, and was supposed to take place on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe Wilson Trail begins on the south side of Hong Kong and snakes its way north to the mainland border. It passes through a variety of environments, and comes close to urban districts such as Quarry Bay, which have seen protests in recent months.\n\n\u201cWe understand the concern on whether the event could be held in this weekend under a safe environment,\u201d the race organisers posted on Facebook. \u201cWe have closely monitored the traffic conditions of our racing regions and assessed their impacts on our event. As of now, due to the prevailing uncertainties, cancellation has become a difficult but necessary decision for the sake of the safety of our participants and volunteers.\u201d\n\nProtests that began in June in opposition to a controversial extradition bill that would have seen fugitives sent back to mainland China, has spiralled into nearly weekly violent clashes between protesters and police.\n\n\u201cWe will inform all runners of the post-cancellation arrangements soon\u201d the organisers said. \u201cThanks once again for the unfailing support of our volunteers, participants, sponsors and supporting organisations to Raleigh Hong Kong.\u201d", "description": "The Raleigh Challenge \u2013 Wilson Trail has cancelled all of its distances, calling it a difficult but necessary decision", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/09/81fdade8-ea5a-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_151128.JPG?itok=b3BXyNzK&v=1570605094", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
