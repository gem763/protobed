For the full year this figure, which strips out significant items, was tipped at between $80 million and $85 million.\n\nThat includes the boost from Methven, a New Zealand-based taps and showers specialist that GWA bought in April this year. Mr Salt said the comparative figure for last year would be $83 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe argued this would be a \u201cgreat\u201d result in a shrinking market. \u201cWe're very much ... thinking the second half will be stronger than the first half, more as a result of what we're doing rather than necessarily what the market\u2019s doing,\u201d he said.\n\nChanges included focusing on costs. Mr Salt said they had been able to source some cheaper providers of certain goods in countries such as Vietnam, and Chinese suppliers were also dropping prices because of the impact of trade tensions with the US.\n\nJob numbers were about 850, and he said GWA would look to natural attrition rather than engage on big employee redundancies.\n\nThe meeting passed smoothly with investors heavily backing resolutions.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services, which advises big investors on resolution voting, backed GWA\u2019s remuneration structures overall, saying pay and performance was reasonably aligned.\n\nThat was despite some ISS concerns about Mr Salt\u2019s fixed pay, at $967,000 last year, being above industry averages.\n\nIt also queried one measure \u2013 return on funds employed \u2013 being applied to short and long-term bonuses \u201cmeaning the company may be paying incentives to executives twice for the same performance\u201d.", "description": "\u201cIt is challenging out there,\u201d says the maker of kitchen and toilet fittings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4133%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_119%2C$y_240/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0c2bb56dc78e965881921b8743e3311606cf0230", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
