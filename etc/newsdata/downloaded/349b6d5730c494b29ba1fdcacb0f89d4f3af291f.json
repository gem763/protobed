Trump has consistently said his economic policies have been good for African Americans and other people of color.\n\nBut the poll shows few black Americans think that's true. Just 4% say they think Trump's actions have been good for African Americans in general, while 81% think he's made things worse. Similar shares of black Americans think Trump has been bad for Hispanics, Muslims and women.\n\n\"He speaks nothing but hate rhetoric,\" said Chris Smith, 38, an African American information technology worker in Columbia, Tennessee, who considers himself independent but leans Democratic. \"If the leader of this country is free to speak like that, there's going to be people who think it's OK to speak like that.\"\n\n\"He's making people live their life in fear,\" Smith said.\n\nTrump has been accused of launching multiple racist attacks against lawmakers this year\n\nTrump has drawn widespread condemnation for racist rhetoric throughout his presidency. He's warned of an \"invasion\" at the southern border, posted racist tweets about four women of color in Congress and attacked Democratic U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings' largely black district as a \"rat and rodent infested mess.\"\n\nHe's showered praise on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, a slave owner who fought to protect the institution of slavery during the U.S. Civil War, and said there were \"very fine people on both sides \" of clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters. But he has claimed he doesn't have a \"racist bone\" in his body.\n\nRead more: A middle school teacher was removed from the classroom after asking students to write 'funny' captions for pictures of black sharecroppers in the post-Civil War South\n\nThe poll comes weeks after a suspected gunman, who is white, apparently wrote an anti-Hispanic rant before opening fire in El Paso, Texas, with an AK-47-style rifle on Walmart shoppers, many of them Latino. Some blamed Trump's rhetoric for inciting the gunman.\n\nSimon Wey, 54, a Nigerian immigrant who lives in Houston and is a registered Republican, said the president's rhetoric on migrants makes him feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"I think some of his immigration policies have been hurtful to countries with large minority populations,\" Wey said. \"There's a lot of uncertainty now.\"\n\nSixty-nine percent of Latinos think Trump's actions have been bad for Hispanics generally, while 19% think they've been good. Majorities of Latinos also think Trump's actions have been bad for African Americans, Muslims and women.\n\n\"It's his attitude. He just has this real cocky way about him,\" said Rose Haway, a 62-year-old Hispanic woman who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \"It's what he says in his speeches and the way he's treated migrant children. I'm appalled.\"\n\nHaway also pointed to the Republican president's rhetoric about his desire to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as especially hurtful.\n\nIn July, Trump tweeted that Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib should \"go back\" to their countries.

Fewer, 4 in 10, think his actions have been good for Muslims. No more than 2 in 10 Republicans think Trump's actions have been bad for any of the groups asked about in the poll.\n\nThe share of Republicans saying Trump's actions have been good for each group has increased since an AP-NORC poll conducted in February 2018. In that poll, about half said Trump's actions had been good for African Americans and women and about 4 in 10 said they'd been good for Latinos, while about 3 in 10 said they'd been good for Muslims.\n\n___\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,286 adults was conducted Sept. 20-23 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.
