So there is no need to ... use all the power you have in order to move up to 2% if the cost is too high,\" he added, referring to the ECB's inflation target of just below 2%.\n\nProviding a counterpoint to the hawks, Slovenian central bank chief Bostjan Vasle said the ECB remained ready to do even more if needed, as growth and inflation were both weak.", "description": "ECB hawks rally against Draghi's farewell stimulus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8C0VI_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
