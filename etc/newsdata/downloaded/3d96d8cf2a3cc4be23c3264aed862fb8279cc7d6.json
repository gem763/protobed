This has led to many of the groups closing down.\n\nMr Navalny called the move \"absolutely illegal\" and said it was \"obviously a direct order from (President Vladimir) Putin.\"\n\n\"FBK never received a single kopeck of foreign money,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHe demanded that the justice ministry publicly prove that the foundation received funds from outside Russia.\n\nFBK, which has often been raided by authorities, said the move was an attempt to curb its activity.\n\nIts director Ivan Zhdanov said it was \"another attempt to suffocate\" the foundation.\n\nHe said the group, which seeks donations from the public, is funded \"exclusively by Russian citizens.\"\n\nNavalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter that the decision was intended to \"put pressure on us and attempt to stop our activity.\"\n\nWhile barred from mainstream politics, Navalny has kept trying to expose the lavish wealth of Russia's elites, broadcasting the findings of his investigations to millions of Russians on social media and YouTube.", "description": "Russia on Wednesday upped the pressure on opposition leader Alexei Navalny, declaring his organisation a \"foreign agent\" that will be subject to increased state monitoring.", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse", "Julie Burchill", "Hamish De Bretton-Gordon", "Laura Freeman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000211386422-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjJjRpbizeqTeQHsp8ASBdyXKFW6LEF1xaFHr25dXK7E.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
