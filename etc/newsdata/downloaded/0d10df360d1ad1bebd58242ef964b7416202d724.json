Construction on the Carmichael mine and rail project is well underway onsite, and our big contracts are now also lined up as we ramp up activity,\" Mr Dow said.\n\nMartinus Rail is an Australian-founded rail company that has built projects for companies including Aurizon and Rio Tinto as well as for state governments.\n\nBut it has moved to boost its market presence after Malaysian engineering and construction giant Gamuda bought a 50 per cent stake in the company earlier this month.\n\nThe listed Gamuda, which has a market capitalisation of $3.2 billion, is the largest contractor in Malaysia, with over 5000 staff across Asia and the Middle East.\n\nGamuda has done joint-ventures with another big Malaysian company, MMC, on infrastructure projects such as the $10 billion Mass Rapid Transit Line 2. MMC has done work with Adani on ports in Malaysia.\n\nGamuda said earlier this month it was buying into the privately-owned Australian company to allow them to bid for up to $20 billion worth of projects over the next few years, especially rail projects.\n\nThey said Australia's infrastructure development pipeline is about $300 billion and rail infrastructure spending is forecast to grow by about 14 per cent a year until 2023.\n\nMartinus Rail managing director Treaven Martinus said they were keen for regional communities to get the benefit of the Carmichael project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are keen to now get started and looking forward to partnering with numerous local Rockhampton and other regional Queensland businesses and people to get our part of the project underway,\" he said.\n\nFederal Resources Minister Matt Canavan said Friday's announcement \u2013 which will see Martinus Rail operate out of Adani's Rockhampton office \u2013 was further evidence the Adani project was delivering jobs for regional Queensland.\n\n\"I spent years fighting for the Adani project because it means delivering jobs and economic activity for regional Queensland. These announcements are more proof in the pudding,\" he said.\n\nAnti-Adani activists, who have taken to \"naming and shaming\" contractors who work with the Indian energy company, are now expected to target Martinus Rail.\n\nA string of anti-Adani groups have been holding weekly protests outside the office of companies that may be involved in the Carmichael coal and rail project, including rail haulage company Aurizon and engineering company GHD.\n\nSome agitators have even been ringing the private mobile numbers of chief executives in the early hours of the morning, including AFR Rich Lister John Wagner, whose cement quarry in Townsville has been targeted by protesters.", "description": "Indian energy company Adani has awarded a $100 million rail contract to Martinus Rail as part of its $2 billion Carmichael mine project.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7041%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1613%2C$y_638/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/57611f507c6fbb2f3fddc9b9fa7ddd88af530c8e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
