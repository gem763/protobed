The Conservative Party has very generously broadcast footage of me and my friends saying we want an election. I do not retreat from that wish whatsoever. We are eager for an election.\n\n\u201cBut as keen as we are for an election, we are not prepared to risk inflicting the disaster of No Deal on our constituents.\u201d", "description": "This is the British prime minister's sixth defeat in six days.", "authors": ["Executive Editor", "Politics", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76c5db2400002e2a77c8f7.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
