It is clear why she is rising in the polls.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s sometimes bizarre segment included him swearing that President Barack Obama kissed him, mistakenly using a phrase to suggest Biden himself is gay and invoking the phrases \u201cgay bathhouses\u201d and \u201cround-the-clock sex.\u201d\n\nAn energetic Warren, meanwhile, walked on stage remarking that she was ready \u201cto have some fun tonight.\u201d And she did.\n\nShe shot down men who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds with a well-received one-liner, sang a children\u2019s church song and also earned applause for targeting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos while still communicating her policy positions.\n\nBiden recalled his 2012 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview during which he expressed support for same-sex marriage. Biden told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Thursday that he had already expressed his position to Obama and simply answered a question honestly on the Sunday show, but \u201ceverybody thought that I had jumped the gun on the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went in on Monday, and all the national press is saying Biden\u2019s gonna really get nailed when he walks in and sees the president every morning. He got up, and he walked over to me. He said, \u2018Well, you told me,\u2019 and he gave me a kiss,\u201d Biden said, walking toward Cooper to embrace him and leaning in as if he were going to give him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI swear to God.\u201d\n\nSen.

A smiling Biden joked to Cooper that he had something to tell him as he moved closer and put his arm around him.\n\n\u201cI kind of figured it out a while ago,\u201d Cooper quipped.\n\nIn Biden\u2019s final comments before exiting the stage, he tried to make the point that most Americans are afraid, not homophobic. They don\u2019t understand LGBTQ people, he said, or know them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not strange. That\u2019s the generic point,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd the more people know that, the more they understand it. Remember, Anderson, back 15, 20 years ago? We talked about this in San Francisco. It was all about, well, you know, gay bathhouses. It was all about round-the-clock sex. Come on, man. Gay couples are likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna leave it there, Mr. Vice President,\u201d Cooper said, ending the segment.\n\nAsked what she would do to ensure passage of the Equality Act in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold the majority, Warren stressed that voters have to elect more Democrats into the upper chamber because LGBTQ protections are a priority for the Democratic Party and she wants to send a message to her GOP colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe believe that equal means equal everywhere,\u201d Warren said of Democrats. \u201cI also say it because I want our Republican friends to hear that in the United States Senate. I want them to know that people vote based on LGBTQ issues. So I\u2019m willing to continue to push Mitch McConnell right now, but my No. 1 goal is to make sure that he is not the majority leader come January 2021.\u201d\n\nWarren maintained her support for eliminating the Senate filibuster, telling the crowd that Senate Republicans \u201ccan\u2019t have a veto\u201d if Americans want to see change on an issue that has a vocal minority of opposition.\n\nAnd while some past education secretaries have been \u201cbetter\u201d using their authority over public schools, the rules and their enforcement, \u201cWe\u2019ve had one that\u2019s been a whole lot worse,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHer name is Betsy DeVos. So when I\u2019m president, she\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\nWarren was also asked about how she would respond on the campaign trail if a supporter told her that his or her faith says marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna assume it\u2019s a guy who said that,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna say then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that \u2014 assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nIt was yet another applause line for Warren, who also drew cheers from the audience for pausing her comments to acknowledge that she loves saying \u201cas president\u201d and vowing to \u201cdo what a president can do all by herself\u201d to end the AIDS pandemic.\n\nThough Warren grew up in a conservative household and was a registered Republican before becoming a Democrat, the Massachusetts senator said that while she doesn\u2019t \u201chave notes from when I was a little kid,\u201d she also doesn\u2019t remember having a different position on same-sex marriage.\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

They are precious in his sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hatefulness, frankly, always really shocked me, especially for people of faith because I think the whole foundation is the worth of every single human being,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I get people may make decisions for themselves that are different than the decisions other people make, but by golly, those are decisions about you. They are not decisions that tell people what they can or cannot do.\u201d\n\nWarren said she regrets criticizing a judge\u2019s ruling that granted transition-related surgery to a transgender inmate during her 2012 Senate campaign but failed to take a strong position on whether she believed crimes against transgender people should be charged as hate crimes.\n\n\u201cI think we could if we think that\u2019s going to be the most effective way to make change,\u201d she said.\n\nNine candidates participated in the marathon series of town halls, which lasted until midnight, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont pulled out of the event after recently suffering a heart attack, but his campaign released a statement Thursday afternoon expressing support for the LGBTQ community.\n\nButtigieg, the only openly gay candidate in the 2020 field, spoke between Biden and Warren in personal terms about what it was like for him to come out and whether he believes God made him gay.\n\n\"There is no right or wrong way to be gay, to be queer, to be trans,\" Buttigieg said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/85/a7a2599f49878c195062bedc0310/191010-biden-cnn-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
