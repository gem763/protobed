The Scottish National Party isn\u2019t going to rescue him at the last moment by ditching the other parties in the anti-no-deal alliance and voting for an early election.\n\nThe prime minister can\u2019t pass a motion of no confidence in his own government because the anti-no-deal parties will, to pile absurdity on absurdity, vote against it (that is, that they do have confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s Government).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This has been known for some time as the Garamond Compromise \u2013 that if Johnson printed the withdrawal agreement in a new typeface, and Garamond is elegant, MPs might vote for something that was cosmetically different.\n\nIs there a change \u2013 a bit more substantial than the font \u2013 that could be made to the withdrawal agreement that would persuade 30 more MPs than voted for it last time to do so at the last moment?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely. Johnson cut the ground from under his own feet on Wednesday, when he said that, if the anti-no-deal bill became law, it \u201ceffectively ends the negotiations\u201d with the EU. He meant that the EU side would have no incentive to compromise if it knew that we weren\u2019t going to leave without a deal.\n\nBut he may have been too emphatic. It is possible that EU leaders might think that another extension would only postpone the problem rather than solve it. If they see the chance of what they call an orderly Brexit, with a deal, they may want to take the chance to help make it happen.\n\nThey might calculate that further delay is likely to lead to the election of a Tory government, this time with a parliamentary majority in favour of a no-deal exit if necessary. They might decide that wearing down British resistance by an endless delay that eventually leads to a second referendum is more trouble than it is worth.\n\nSo they might think it was worth making minor concessions \u2013 I have no idea what they might be, but some form of words about sectoral checks away from the Irish border might be branded by Johnson as a democratic backstop rather than an undemocratic one.\n\nThen we are back to the familiar arithmetic: if Johnson could win over 12 of the hard-Brexit Tory MPs who voted against May\u2019s deal all three times \u2013 this time with the added inducement of being expelled from the party if they vote the wrong way (the disciplinarian crackdown on the soft Brexiteers could pay dividends); if he could persuade the 10 DUP MPs; and if the 17 in Stephen Kinnock\u2019s \u201cLabour MPs for a Deal\u201d group belatedly did what they regret not doing in the first place; then a withdrawal agreement could pass.\n\nWell, unlikelier things have happened.", "description": "The big question in British politics now is not if\u00a0Boris Johnson will resign but when.
