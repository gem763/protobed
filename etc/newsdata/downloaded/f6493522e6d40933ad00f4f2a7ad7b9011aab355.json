For investors, earnings season is less about what management reports about the past and more about what management forecasts for the future. After all, the value of a stock overwhelmingly depends on the outlook for earnings.\n\nAccording to Factset, the average Wall Street analyst expects S&P 500 (^GSPC) earnings to grow 10.5% in 2020.\n\nBut many of Wall Street\u2019s most prominent banks are telling clients that ain\u2019t happening. In a note to clients on Monday, Morgan Stanley U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson took a chart with that consensus 2020 earnings forecast and annotated it with two words: \u201cLooks unrealistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsensus expects S&P 500 EPS will rise by 10% in 2020 compared with our top-down forecast of 6%\u201d Goldman Sachs U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said on Friday. \u201cConsensus expects margin expansion of 54 bp will drive aggregate EPS growth. However, we forecast profit margins will only rise by 14 bp as input costs continue to challenge the increase in prices charged. Many firms have been unable to keep pace with their input cost inflation.\u201d\n\nSome of these more cautious strategists point to a slew of underestimated cost pressures including from higher costs of goods amid the trade war and rising wage costs amid the increasingly tight labor market.\n\nOthers warn that revenue could disappoint amid the shaky economic backdrop. On Monday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. equity strategist Savita Subramanian said: \u201c2020 consensus numbers still look too high to us... which we think are overly optimistic given macro data.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on with these consensus 2020 numbers that seem to be getting no love from anyone willing to speak up?\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Wilson attributes it to the fact that very few companies have actually provided their own forecasts for 2020.\n\n\u201cAs we have moved through this year and watched earnings guidance come down every quarter, the estimates have followed,\u201d Wilson said last week. \u201cHowever, the numbers haven\u2019t changed as much for 2020 because companies don\u2019t guide that far out, leaving 2020 estimates unrealistic, in our view.\u201d\n\nTraders work on the floor of New York Stock Exchange October 8, 2008. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, strategists say their clients are just as skeptical.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, investors are reluctant to buy into such optimism given anemic near-term earnings and weak economics,\u201d Credit Suisse U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub said. \u201cMany are quick to warn that projections will invariably fall, putting pressure on stock prices.\u201d\n\nOn September 20, Citi U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich initiated a 2020 year-end target of 3,300 for the S&P 500, which would reflect 10%+ gains from here. But he too is cautious about earnings growth, forecasting EPS to climb just 4.8%.\n\n\u201cAnother profits reset looks probable for 2020 but many on the Street already think that low single-digit numbers are appropriate based on client survey work,\u201d Levkovich said.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that there can be so little clarity about what\u2019s happening next year, especially as stock market investors should be thinking on multi-year time horizons. For what it\u2019s worth, Wall Street strategists have historically been proven to be too cautious about earnings growth. So, maybe 10% earnings growth isn\u2019t so unlikely.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
