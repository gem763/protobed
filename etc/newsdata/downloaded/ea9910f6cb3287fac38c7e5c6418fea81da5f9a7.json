Now I hope Scott Morrison gets tough here with a few backhanders \u2026 hasn\u2019t got a clue this woman.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s comments were condemned as violent and misogynistic by women\u2019s rights groups on both sides of the Tasman, and more than 100 brands have since pulled advertising from his program. Morrison also condemned the comments.\n\nOn 16 August Jones penned an apology letter to the New Zealand PM, saying he never intended to cause offence, which has been released to the Guardian under an Official Information Request \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s version of FOI.\n\n\u201cMy dear Prime Minister,\u201d the letter begins.\n\nJones says he and Ardern\u2019s opinions on climate change \u201cdiffer significantly\u201d and his comments, which don\u2019t need to be repeated, \u201cdidn\u2019t come out quite as I intended\u201d.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister, I would like to ensure you that I did not intend to suggest any violence towards you,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhile I may disagree with your stance on climate change, I would never wish any harm to you.\n\n\u201cI had meant to say \u2018put a sock in it\u2019 and my actual words were taken literally by some who took offence on your behalf.\n\n\u201cPlease accept my sincere apology for the words spoken, and I hope that my intentions are, at least now, clear.\u201d\n\nJones goes on to say that, if she so wishes, he is happy to discuss the matter by telephone with the PM \u2013 and then pitches for an on-air interview.\n\nAlan Jones says advertisers who leave his program will be replaced by others Read more\n\n\u201cI would also like to extend a standing invitation to participate in an interview on my programme, which would allow us to constructively debate the issue of climate change,\u201d he writes. \u201cAgain, my sincerest apologies and please know I wish you and your family only the best.\u201d\n\nArdern did not take up Jones\u2019s offer of a follow-up phone call, or the invitation to appear on his radio program. She has repeatedly refused to condemn the comments and told New Zealand\u2019s AM show in August that he had a right to air his opinions.\n\n\u201cI understand that he of course used to be closely linked to the Wallabies so let\u2019s just say that I think that revenge is best served through a Bledisloe Cup,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on every single person who says something about me. And particularly given this is an Australian commentator, we\u2019ve got enough of our own to occupy my time without me having to jump into something that an Aussie says.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: Radio host says he meant \u2018no violence\u2019 toward New Zealand PM with his \u2018shove a sock down throat\u2019 comment and asks Ardern to a debate on climate change", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca8bf1f41f6d55d8d41cecc6cb2da270dbdc82e/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f9882cf281fbff7fab8cf87653dad82d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
