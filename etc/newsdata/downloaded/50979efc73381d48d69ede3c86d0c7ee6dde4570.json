Her new book, \u201cBlowout: Corrupted Democracy, Rogue State Russia, and the Richest, Most Destructive Industry on Earth,\u201d is currently the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com on the heels of being released earlier this week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
