However, iOS 13.1 includes some of the features -- such as audio sharing -- that Apple had announced would be included in iOS 13, but eventually removed it prior to iOS 13's release.\n\nThe iOS 13 beta was one full of frustration and bugs for testers, including myself. At times, it felt as if each new beta release had more issues and hiccups than the previous version, and eventually, Apple quit updating the iOS 13 and upgraded users to a new iOS 13.1 beta.\n\niOS 13 includes new privacy features, a system-wide dark mode, battery optimization tools, and big improvements to the iPad via iPadOS. The tablet now boasts a desktop-class version of Safari, along with new multitasking features that aim to complete its laptop-replacement appeal.\n\nYou can update your iPhone to iOS 13 right now by opening the Settings app on your iPhone and going to General > Software update.
