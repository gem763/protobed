The Finnish company, which listed its shares last year and cut its 2019 outlook on higher investment costs last month, said its third-quarter operating profit was 5.4 million euros ($6.00 million), while sales grew 5.4% on year to 74.8 million euros.\n\nAngry Birds maker Rovio's third-quarter profit halves year-on-year", "description": "Angry Birds maker Rovio's third-quarter profit halves year-on-year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA680E9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
