The company\u2019s quarterly results are expected to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.\n\n\n\nIn the last reported quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based data-center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 0.61% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results were supported by growth in revenues.\n\n\n\nThe company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all four occasions \u2014 the average beat being 1.67%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\n\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.\n\n\n\nFactors to Consider\n\n\n\nSolid fundamentals of the data-center market are likely to have helped Digital Realty ride on its growth curve in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, demand for space at properties of data-center REITs has been climbing.\n\n\n\nAlso, the artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets have been growing at a solid pace, fueling demand for such real estates. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.\n\n\n\nAmid these, Digital Realty is banking on strategic acquisitions and development efforts for building a premium portfolio of high-quality facilities located across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia. The company\u2019s presence in strategic locations is helping it offer data-center, colocation and inter-connection solutions for domestic and international tenants efficiently.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the full spectrum of data-center solutions across a global platform is likely to have helped the company achieve growth in customers, with several having multiple locations across the portfolio. Also, significant customer investment is likely to have ensured stable retention.\n\n\n\nTherefore, such expansion efforts are likely to have driven the company\u2019s top and bottom lines in the quarter under consideration. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter total revenues is $815.1 million, indicating 6% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nHowever, competition has intensified, given the solid growth potential in the data-center real estate market. This is likely to have led to aggressive pricing pressure in the quarter under review. In addition to this, interest-expense burden remains a concern, with the company having a substantial debt position.\n\n\n\nAmid these, Digital Realty\u2019s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts\u2019 confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at $1.64 in a month\u2019s time. However, it indicates improvement of 0.61% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\n\n\nHere is what our quantitative model predicts:\n\n\n\nOur proven model predicts a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Digital Realty this season around.
