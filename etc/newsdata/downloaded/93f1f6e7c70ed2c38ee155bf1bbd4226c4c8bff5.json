About 40% of the population lives within 100 kilometers of a coast, and one in 10 people live in areas less than 10 meters above sea level, it said.\n\nGoldman highlighted three cities that could be subject to storm surges and could face harmful flooding: New York, Tokyo, and Lagos. It said several others that are less than 11 meters above sea level \u2013 including Miami, Florida; Alexandria, Egypt; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Shanghai, China \u2013 also faced major flood risks.\n\ncaption Areas such as Brooklyn and Queens in New York could be affected heavily. source Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman\u2019s researchers said they started with the scientific consensus that \u201chuman activity \u2013 principally the emission of greenhouse gases \u2013 is causing the earth to warm in ways that are affecting the climate.\u201d\n\nThey said that natural ecosystems would be damaged, human health would be threatened, and food and drinking-water systems would be pressured. For example, agriculture would be massively affected, as \u201cwarmer temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns could reduce yields and nutritional quality as well change growing seasons and agricultural zones around the world.\u201d\n\nGoldman gave some fairly stark warnings about potential outcomes:\n\n\u201cMore frequent, more intense and longer-lasting heatwaves\u201d that affect human health, productivity, economic activity, and agriculture. \u201cHigher surface temperatures could exacerbate the warming process by causing permafrost to melt, releasing further methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nthat affect human health, productivity, economic activity, and agriculture. \u201cHigher surface temperatures could exacerbate the warming process by causing permafrost to melt, releasing further methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.\u201d \u201cDestructive weather events, including storms, winds, flooding and fires.\u201d It\u2019s not just New York, Tokyo, and Lagos; \u201cother major low-lying coastal or already flood-prone cities include Shanghai, Dhaka, Mumbai and Karachi \u2013 each of which has a population of 15 million people or more.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just New York, Tokyo, and Lagos; \u201cother major low-lying coastal or already flood-prone cities include Shanghai, Dhaka, Mumbai and Karachi \u2013 each of which has a population of 15 million people or more.\u201d \u201cChanging disease patterns.\u201d The researchers said that \u201cwarmer temperatures could cause disease vectors to migrate from the tropics to regions where people have less immunity; this is true not only for viruses like malaria and dengue fever but also for water-borne and food-borne diseases.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said that \u201cwarmer temperatures could cause disease vectors to migrate from the tropics to regions where people have less immunity; this is true not only for viruses like malaria and dengue fever but also for water-borne and food-borne diseases.\u201d \u201cShifting agricultural patterns\u201d and food shortages. \u201cLivestock could be affected by higher temperatures and reduced water supplies. Ocean acidification is likely to put stress on aquatic populations and affect current fishing patterns. Some of these changes are already underway.

These dynamics could affect everything from the availability of drinking water for people to a shortage of water for livestock and crops (with negative effects for the food supply) to decreases in hydroelectric power generation.\u201d\n\ncaption Tokyo Bay, Japan, and Lagos, Nigeria, also could suffer. source Goldman Sachs\n\nThe bank said those things would \u201caffect economic activity, damage infrastructure \u2013 from buildings to transportation to water and waste-management systems \u2013 and disproportionately harm vulnerable residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the uncertainty around the timing and scale of the impact, it may be prudent for some cities to start investing in adaptation now,\u201d Goldman said, adding that \u201curban adaptation could drive one of the largest infrastructure build-outs in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the scale of the task, urban adaptation will likely need to draw on innovative sources of financing,\u201d the report said.", "description": "Business Insider - Half the population lives in cities, many in areas less than 10 meters above sea level, and should \"start investing in adaptation now,\" Goldman said..
