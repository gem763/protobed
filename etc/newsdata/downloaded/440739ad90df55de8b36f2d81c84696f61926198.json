Government is storing up very serious future problems by the way it is trying to implement this,\" Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted.\n\nThe Labour Party argued that Johnson was running from proper parliamentary scrutiny. Its official position is to vote down both the bill and his timetable, but rebel MPs within the party could swing the votes towards Johnson.\n\nKen Clarke, a former Conservative minister turned independent whose vote could be crucial, added: \"If the Government is for some reason insistent on dashing for this completely silly and irrelevant date which it keeps staking its fate on then give some proper time for debate. Two-and-a-bit days of ordinary parliamentary hours is plainly quite insufficient.\"\n\nJohnson warned Tuesday that he would pull the bill altogether and push for a general election, if MPs attempted to derail the government's tight legislative timetable.\n\n\"I will in no way allow months more of this,\" Johnson said earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\"If we do this deal, if we pass this deal and the legislation that enables it, we can turn the page and allow this country and this Parliament to begin to heal and unite,\" he added.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have twice rejected the Prime Minister's efforts to force a snap general election, calling for no-deal Brexit to be taken off the table first.\n\nBut Johnson may feel the calculus for a public vote has shifted since Saturday, when he was forced to request a Brexit extension from the EU -- something he said repeatedly he'd \"rather be dead in a ditch\" than agree.\n\nThe request for a Brexit extension is now sitting with the EU, and as a Labour spokesperson told CNN, \"We've always said take the threat of no deal away and let's have an election.\"\n\nIf the extension is granted and it's long enough for the nation to hold an election, then it's full steam ahead with the campaign. And Johnson's seemed to be testing out his Brexit ballot box message in the chamber Tuesday night, saying: \"Are honorable members really going to tell their constituents that at the last minute, they handed the decision to Brussels? Let's get Brexit done!\"\n\nAt least one ex-Tory lawmaker though has suggested Downing Street is bluffing. Nick Boles -- a leader in the ex-Tory, anti-no-deal brigade -- said Tuesday there was \"no way\" Johnson would pull a successful bill.\n\n\"No 10 is bluffing, as usual. There is no way that after winning a famous victory on 2nd reading the PM is going to pull the bill just because MPs reject the programme motion. He will bring forward a revised motion giving us a few more days and blame Parliament for any extension,\" Boles tweeted.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's vision for Britain's exit from the European Union cleared its first hurdle in Parliament, only to have lawmakers vote against the government's accelerated timeline for the legislation minutes later.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191019102725-boris-johnson-1019-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
