Of the 140,000, some 55,000 have a gambling addiction \u2013 a figure that has quadrupled since 2016.\n\nGambling included on fruit machines in pubs, bingo, in betting shops or via online websites \u2013 all of which are illegal for under-18s\n\nThe report also found more than one in ten 11 to 16 year-olds \u2013 about 350,000 \u2013 had gambled their own money in the past week, betting an average of \u00a317 each.\n\nThis is more than the number who used e-cigarettes, smoked tobacco or taken drugs.\n\nGambling included on fruit machines in pubs, bingo, in betting shops or via online websites \u2013 all of which are illegal for under-18s.\n\nA significant proportion \u2013 almost 100,000 children \u2013 had gambled online, three times more than the previous year.\n\nCharles Ritchie, of the charity Gambling With Lives, which was set up by parents bereaved by gambling-related suicide, said: \u2018Parents should be very worried that gambling online has increased and, that child gamblers are four times more likely to get addicted than adults.\n\nThis is a life-threatening illness that can result in suicide and there are no public health warnings.\u2019\n\nCompanies are still bombarding under-17s with advertising, according to the Gambling Commission report.\n\nSome 360,000 children have been directly targeted with marketing via email, their phone or on social media \u2013 even though this is banned under advertising rules.\n\nMore than 2.2 million children had seen or heard gambling ads or sponsorship, and 150,000 of this group said it had prompted them to gamble with money.\n\nThe report also revealed children had been effectively exposed to gambling via controversial \u2018loot boxes\u2019 in computer games. More than 1.4 million had paid money to open unregulated loot boxes, embedded in popular computer games such as Fortnite or FIFA.\n\nA significant proportion \u2013 almost 100,000 children \u2013 had gambled online, three times more than the previous year\n\nThe Lord Bishop of St Albans, Alan Smith, said the figures showed that \u2018tens of thousands of families could be living in a nightmare\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018When the average spend on gambling by children is \u00a317 per week, it is evidence of potential serious family finance problems. A civilised, modern society must not accept this crisis as normal or become content with it.\u2019\n\nLord Chadlington, former chairman of Action On Addiction, said: \u2018This reinforces the need for further independent research on gambling-related harm.\u2019\n\nLabour deputy leader Tom Watson, who wants to bring in a new Gambling Act, said: \u2018Levels of problem gambling among children remain stubbornly high.\n\n\u2018One child gambling addict is too many, let alone 55,000, and these figures show one in ten children is gambling every week. The Government\u2019s soft-touch approach to gambling regulation has failed.\u2019\n\nThe Mail has campaigned for tighter gambling regulations for many years.\n\nThe industry regulator\u2019s report was based on an Ipsos Mori survey of 2,950 11 to 16-year-olds, between February and June.\n\nThe survey asked if children had used gambling to escape problems in their daily lives, if they had stolen money to gamble or if they had chased losses. Boys are about three times more likely to develop a gambling problem than girls, the data showed.\n\nBut although problem gambling remains high, the number of children gambling regularly is falling. In 2015, 17 per cent were gambling regularly, whereas this year the number is 11 per cent.\n\nGambling Commission executive director Tim Miller said: \u2018Any child or young person that experiences harm from these areas is a concern to us and we are absolutely committed to doing everything we can to protect them from gambling harms.\n\n\u2018Where operators have failed to protect children and young people, we have and will continue to take firm action.\u2019", "description": "Gambling included on fruit machines in pubs, bingo, in betting shops or via online websites - all of which are illegal for under-18s in the UK.", "authors": ["Tom Witherow Business Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/00/20108024-0-image-a-12_1571871897394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
