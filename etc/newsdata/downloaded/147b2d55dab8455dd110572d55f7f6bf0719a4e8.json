Iraq\u2019s prime minister has shown few signs of being able to satisfy those demands.\n\nAD\n\nA deadly crackdown on demonstrations earlier this month set the stage for Friday\u2019s violence. At least 165 people were killed and more than 6,000 injured in the last round of clashes, according to Iraqi health and human rights officials.\n\nAD\n\nAn official investigation into the handling of those earlier protests absolved top government authorities of blame for the use of live ammunition against demonstrators, concluding that local commanders \u201clost control over their forces.\u201d But in private, Iraqi officials accuse powerful Iranian-linked militias for sending snipers onto the streets and targeting journalists who covered the fallout.\n\nIn answering a nationwide call for fresh protests, thousands rallied across the country Friday as black-clad riot police met the crowds with lethal violence. Clashes continued into the night across Baghdad and much of southern Iraq. At least 27 government buildings were attacked, the human rights commission said, with several set ablaze. In the cities of Basra and Wasit, the government declared curfews.\n\nSecurity forces fanned out across the capital, and when demonstrators tried to march on the heavily fortified Green Zone, the violence began. Security forces fired volley after volley of tear gas. Water cannons followed, then rubber bullets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmbulances screamed in and out of the central Tahrir Square, whisking the wounded to the hospital along roads that looked almost deserted. Young men reeled as tear gas filled the air. Many deaths appeared to have been caused by suffocation or in stampedes caused by tear gas volleys.\n\nSeveral people were killed after being struck in the head with searing tear gas canisters. White fumes of tear gas kept rising around one lifeless body as it lay on the ground, draped in an Iraqi flag.\n\nThe violence weeks earlier had taken place in a near information blackout: The country\u2019s Internet was cut, journalists were threatened, and hospitals said they had been forbidden to share casualty counts with the media.\n\nAD\n\nProtesters said the earlier crackdown had motivated them to join the crowds on Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the blood of those who died [before] to go in vain,\u201d said 24-year old Muna Ali, dressed in canary yellow and holding the national flag aloft.\n\nAD\n\nThis month\u2019s unrest has largely been confined to poor neighborhoods, and participants are overwhelming male. But Ali said her presence had been inspired by the images of women and girls participating in separate anti-government protests in Lebanon.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell my parents, but I\u2019m here to demand my rights. This is bigger than jobs and services; it\u2019s about the whole country. We want our country back,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nDespite Iraq\u2019s vast oil wealth, some 7 million people live in poverty. For the most part, the protesters are part of a generation raised in the shadow of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The political system that emerged in its wake \u2014 where power is shared among groups from various religious and ethnic sects \u2014 has entrenched widespread corruption, experts say, and left political connections as important ways for families to get ahead.\n\nAD\n\nOn the eve of Friday\u2019s protests, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi had tried for the third time in weeks to calm the streets. He said that constitutional amendments would be introduced and warned that government resignations would only \u201clead the country into chaos.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, also called on protesters and security forces to remain peaceful.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cReal reform and change in the country has to be through peaceful methods,\u201d a Sistani representative said during a sermon in the Shiite holy city of Karbala.\n\nLoveluck reported from Irbil, Iraq.
