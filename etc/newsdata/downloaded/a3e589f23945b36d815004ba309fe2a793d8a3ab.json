REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/Files\n\nThe decision marks Clijsters\u2019 second return to the sport after first retiring in 2007.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I want to prove something,\u201d Clijsters said on the WTA Insider Podcast. \u201cI think for me it\u2019s the challenge.\n\n\u201cThe love for the sport is obviously still there. But the question is, am I capable of bringing it to a level where I would like it to be before I play at a high level of one of the best women\u2019s sports in the world.\n\n\u201cI want to challenge myself and I want to be strong again. This is my marathon.\u201d\n\nTwo years after winning her first major at the 2005 U.S. Open, an injury-plagued Clijsters decided to quit the game at the age of 23 to start a family, returning two years later to claim her second U.S. Open as an unranked player in only her third tournament back.\n\nClijsters defended her title at Flushing Meadows the following year and then won the Australia Open in 2011 en route to topping the world rankings for the first time since 2006.\n\nWith 41 titles to her name, Clijsters hung up her racket after the 2012 U.S. Open and later worked as a tennis commentator.\n\nClijsters said she has been considering a return to the tour for the past two years.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had more energy these last six months or so than I\u2019ve had in the last two years because I\u2019m taking care of myself better,\u201d Clijsters added.\n\n\u201cEven if I don\u2019t make it, this whole process has been so worth it for me to get back into a good routine.\u201d", "description": "Four-times Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters plans to come out of retirement after a seven-year hiatus, returning to the WTA Tour in 2020, the 36-year-old Belgian said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429062501&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B10U", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
