That question was at the heart of a hearing Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nAfter public pressure from House Democrats, the complaint was released Wednesday to Congress and a redacted version was released publicly Thursday.\n\n[The Takeaways and key allegations from the whistleblower complaint]\n\nHere\u2019s what we learned in Thursday morning\u2019s public hearing.\n\nMaguire doesn\u2019t think he did anything wrong in keeping the complaint from Congress\n\nHe says he followed protocol: He got a whistleblower complaint that he immediately regarded as \u201cserious,\u201d detailing allegations of abuse of power by the president. So Maguire went to the White House\u2019s lawyers to make sure it wouldn\u2019t fall under executive privilege. Then he went to the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers to get their advice about whether this complaint was \u201curgent\u201d enough to require being sent to Congress. And they decided it wasn\u2019t, so he couldn\u2019t. \u201cI have to work with what I got,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem with how Maguire handled this, Democrats argue, is that he failed to take into context the politics of the moment. This isn\u2019t a typical whistleblower complaint; those normally deal with bad-acting middle managers. It\u2019s a complaint against the president of the United States.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s appropriate that you go to a department run by someone who\u2019s the subject of the complaint to get advice \u2014 or who is a subject of the complaint or implicated in the complaint for advice as to whether you should provide that to Congress? Did \u2014 did that conflict of interest concern you?\u201d asked House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nUnder questioning from Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), Maguire brought up his being new to the job as a reason he handled the complaint the way he did. He received the complaint on his second day as the acting DNI: \u201cI am the acting director of national intelligence, and I was still using Garmin to get to work,\u201d he said.\n\nMaguire refused to say whether he talked to the president about the complaint\n\nMaguire said all conversations he has with the president are secret, so he wouldn\u2019t share whether he talked about the complaint with the president. He also didn\u2019t deny that they had that conversation, repeatedly saying under questioning from Democrats: \u201cI speak to the president about a lot of things, and anything that I say to the president of the United States in any form is privileged.\u201d\n\nThat response clearly frustrated Democrats, who couldn\u2019t surmise whether Maguire\u2019s refusal to provide any insight on this was based on principle that the intelligence chief should be able to speak freely with the president without Congress knowing, or whether he was hiding something.\n\nMaguire didn\u2019t do anything to fuel attempts to discredit the whistleblower\n\nPage five of the report, by intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson, about the whistleblower says he wants to point out that the whistleblower has \u201carguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival candidate.\u201d In the very next sentence, Atkinson also determined that didn\u2019t affect the credibility of the complaint.\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies in Congress glommed onto that, and Trump himself has called the whistleblower, without knowing his or her identity, \u201ca political hack.\u201d\n\nBut under questioning from Schiff, Maguire backed up the whistleblower's credibility.\n\nSCHIFF: You don\u2019t believe the whistleblower is a political hack? MAGUIRE: I believe the whistleblower is operating in good faith and has followed the law.\n\nA few minutes later:\n\nSCHIFF: Do you have any reason to accuse him or her of disloyalty to the country or suggest he is beholden to anything else but the country? MAGUIRE: Absolutely not. I believe the whistleblower followed the steps every way.\n\nAt least one Republican said the transcript of the call was not okay\n\nHere\u2019s Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), when he got his turn to speak, addressing the president directly: \u201cThis is not okay. That conversation is not okay, and I think it\u2019s disappointing to the American public when they read this transcript.\u201d\n\nAt this point, we can count on our hands the number of Republican lawmakers who have publicly criticized the president for this call.\n\nBut most Republicans were backing the president\n\nEspecially the top Republican on the intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). He used his five-minute opening statement to accuse Democrats of working with journalists to try to overturn the 2016 election and connect the matter at hand to other ways Trump allies think Democrats are conspiring to get rid of Trump.\n\n\u201cToday, Democrats accuse the president of pressuring Ukrainians to take actions that would help himself or hurt his political opponents, and yet there are numerous examples of Democrats doing the exact same thing,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cAnd, of course, Democrats on this very committee negotiated with people who they thought were Ukrainians in order to obtain nude pictures of Trump.\u201d\n\nNunes misconstrued the facts in his opening statement \u2014 he said that former vice president Joe Biden solicited help from Ukraine, when the facts don\u2019t bear that out. Or Nunes conflated leaking with whistleblowing.\n\n\"A cabal of leakers\" says @DevinNunes.\n\n\n\nAgain, a formal whistleblowing complaint is the exact opposite of a leak. The whistleblower specifically chose not to leak and go through legal, available inside channels. \u2014 Kate Brannen (@K8brannen) September 26, 2019\n\nBut ignoring the facts of the call and this complaint is something many Republicans are having to do as they defend the president on this matter.", "description": "He thinks the whistleblower acted in good faith.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4wXI4MZPNhVdtX5Zk54y8vUsoak=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-26-2019/t_9629cb063d8b41df9b93bab5b88f607a_name_Maguire_thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
