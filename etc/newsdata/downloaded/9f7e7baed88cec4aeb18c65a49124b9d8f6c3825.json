I didn\u2019t have any business relationship or friendship with him. I didn\u2019t go to New Mexico or Florida or Palm Beach or any of that,\u201d Gates told the Journal. \u201cThere were people around him who were saying, hey, if you want to raise money for global health and get more philanthropy, he knows a lot of rich people.\n\n\u201cEvery meeting where I was with him were meetings with men. I was never at any parties or anything like that. He never donated any money to anything that I know about,\u201d Gates added.\n\nEpstein and Gates first met in person, according to the Times, on Jan. 31, 2011, at Epstein's Upper East Side townhouse. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a former Miss Sweden who had once dated Epstein, was also in attendance with her 15-year-old daughter for the gathering, which lasted several hours. (Andersson-Dubin and her husband, Glenn Dubin\u2014a friend and business partner of Epstein's\u2014declined to comment on the Times story.) Afterwards, Epstein boasted to his friends and associates: \u201cBill\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nGates also praised Epstein the next day in an email of his own, according to the report. \u201cA very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late,\u201d he told colleagues.\n\nAccording to the Times, Epstein also spoke with the Gates Foundation and JPMorgan on a possible multibillion-dollar global health charitable fund that would have generated enormous fees for Epstein. The fund never came to fruition and Gates' representative said the tech titan and the foundation were unaware that Epstein would have received fees from the project.\n\nBridgitt Arnold, Gates\u2019s spokeswoman, told the New York Times that Gates \u201cregrets\u201d every meeting he had with Epstein.\n\n\u201cBill Gates regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so,\u201d Arnold told the newspaper. \u201cGates recognizes that entertaining Epstein\u2019s ideas related to philanthropy gave Epstein an undeserved platform that was at odds with Gates\u2019s personal values and the values of his foundation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ronan Farrow\u2019s New Yorker investigation found that Epstein \u201cdirected\u201d a $2 million donation from Gates to the MIT Media Lab in October 2014 (along with another $5.5 million from investor Leon Black).\n\nEpstein was listed as \u201cdisqualified\u201d in MIT\u2019s donor database, the New Yorker revealed, yet the Media Lab continued to take his money, marking the donor as anonymous, and even \u201cconsulted him about the use of the funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGates would like a write up on our one science program for tues next week,\u201d Epstein allegedly wrote in an email to Joi Ito, the lab\u2019s director.\n\nIn an internal email, Ito wrote, \u201cThis is a $2M gift from Bill Gates directed by Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d Peter Cohen, the lab\u2019s former Director of Development and Strategy, replied, \u201cFor gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift.\u201d\n\n\u201c Bill Gates regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so. \u201d \u2014 Gates spokesperson\n\nCNBC reported that Epstein allegedly scored a meeting with Gates after aggressively lobbying his business allies to put in a good word for him.\n\nAccording to the report, the Microsoft mogul met with Epstein in New York in 2013 with other wealthy patrons to discuss \u201cgrowing philanthropy.\u201d After this meeting, Gates reportedly took a ride on Epstein\u2019s plane to meet his family in Florida.\n\nThe Times also reported that Epstein and Gates were seen in private conversation at a California TED conference in 2011.\n\nAfter Gates\u2019 $2 million donation to MIT in October 2014, the Internet billionaire apparently stopped talking to Epstein, a snub the financier complained about to an acquaintance at the end of that year. However, the Times also reported that at least two senior Gates Foundation officials maintained contact with Epstein until late 2017.\n\nAnd Gates was not Epstein\u2019s only Microsoft connection.\n\nWhen Epstein\u2019s last will and testament was filed in August\u2014just two days before his jail-cell suicide\u2014the document named Boris Nikolic, a former adviser to Gates and his foundation, as the backup executor to his $577 million estate.\n\nNikolic, a biotech venture capitalist who worked at Harvard, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn he was listed in the will. \u201cI was not consulted in these matters and I have no intent to fulfill these duties, whatsoever,\u201d he said in a statement obtained by Bloomberg.\n\nLast month, the New York Post reported Nikolic formally declined taking on the role.\n\nAccording to the Times, Nikolic was apparently brought into Epstein's orbit through Melanie Walker, a colleague at the Gates Foundation. Walker told the Times she had met Epstein in 1992 just after she graduated from college; he told her he could get her a modeling job at Victoria's Secret, the company owned by his only known client, Lex Wexner. Walker later stayed in a Manhattan apartment building owned by Epstein and remained close to him over the years.\n\nNathan Myhrvold, the former Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft, also reportedly palled around with Epstein.\n\n\u201c Dershowitz sought to convince Ms. Roberts lawyer that Ms. Roberts was mistaken, and that the person to whom Epstein had lent Ms. Roberts was Nathan Myhrvold, not Dershowitz. \u201d\n\nVanity Fair reported this summer that \u201cMyhrvold has been close with Epstein for years\u201d and that the financier visited Myhrvold\u2019s investment firm, Intellectual Ventures, with some \u201cyoung girls\u201d who looked like \u201cRussian models.\u201d Myhrvold openly discussed using Epstein\u2019s private jet and staying at his Palm Beach and New York mansions, a source told the magazine.\n\nMyhrvold\u2019s spokesperson denied such claims, telling Vanity Fair that \u201cNathan has no knowledge of or any involvement in the various crimes that Mr. Epstein is accused of committing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was never a client of his money management business, and he\u2019s never done business with him of any sort,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cBack in the day Epstein was a regular at TED conferences and he was a large donor to basic scientific research, so while Nathan knew him and has socialized with him, that\u2019s exactly where their association ends.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s friend and onetime attorney Alan Dershowitz, however, has attempted to throw Myhrvold under the bus for years.\n\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre has accused Epstein of keeping her as his \u201cslave\u201d and forcing her to have sex with Dershowitz, Prince Andrew and a host of other high-profile men. (The royal and the Harvard law professor have each denied her claims.)\n\nAs part of his defense, Dershowitz claims Giuffre had sex with Myhrvold\u2014not himself. Indeed, Giuffre\u2019s defamation lawsuit against Dershowitz mentions this accusation.\n\n\u201cIn May 2015 Dershowitz requested confidential settlement negotiations with Ms. Roberts\u2019 lawyers in which Dershowitz sought to convince Ms. Roberts lawyer that Ms. Roberts was mistaken, and that the person to whom Epstein had lent Ms. Roberts was Nathan Myhrvold, not Dershowitz,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nGiuffre\u2019s legal team denies Dershowitz\u2019s allegation.\n\n\u201cDershowitz\u2019s claim that Ms. Roberts confused him with Nathan Myhrvold was tested by showing Ms. Roberts pictures of both. She was, and is, clear that it was Dershowitz, not Myhrvold, with whom she had sex,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.", "description": "The New York Times reported Saturday that the Microsoft co-founder was charmed by Jeffrey Epstein, with whom he met several times after Epstein's release from jail.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Pilar Melendez", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570665910/191009-Briquelet-Epstein-Bill-Gates-tease_twolt1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
