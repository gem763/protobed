The researchers wanted to find out whether the amount was enough to breach the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code by containing undeclared alcohol.\n\nThey pointed out that if these beverages did contain more alcohol than most people think, it could pose concerns for pregnant women, designated drivers, recovering alcoholics, and those who are underage.\n\nSome fermented drinks contain as much alcohol as half a light beer\n\nWhilst it was previously thought that the alcohol produced in fermenting drinks was such a small amount it was negligible, the new study found that some bottles of kombucha contain as much alcohol as half a light beer.\n\nResearchers assessed 239 drink samples from across five areas of Australia, the majority of which were kombucha (132), followed by water-based kefir (43), and dairy-based kefir (7). The remaining 57 drinks sampled came under \"other,\" and included the likes of ginger beer.\n\nThe alcohol content in all the drinks was measured, and they found that:\n\n22.9% of the kombucha samples were more than 1.15% ABV, while 41.9% were between 0.5% and 1.15%, and the remaining were less than 0.5%.\n\n36.7% of the water-based kefir samples were more than 1.15% ABV, and the same percentage fell between 0.5% and 1.15%.\n\nAll the dairy-based kefir samples were under 0.5% ABV.\n\n68.6% of the \"other\" drinks tested were under 0.5% ABV.\n\nTo put this into context, the average beer is around 4.5% ABV, but some are less, so not much more than some kombuchas.\n\nIn certain places, drinks that are over 1.15% ABV are classified as liquor, meaning you need a licence to sell them and proof of age to purchase them.\n\nIn the UK, for example, drinks can only be deemed \"alcohol-free\" if they're under 0.05% ABV, according to DrinkAware. Beverages that are between 0.05% and 1.15% are classed as \"low-alcohol,\" and anything above that is simply alcohol.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that the alcohol content in fermented drinks has the potential to rise the longer it is before the beverage is consumed.\n\nThey found that the amount of alcohol in the drinks varied depending on what other ingredients had been added and the process by which the effervescence had been created.\n\nThe Food Standards committee is now calling on manufacturers to be more responsible in how they label their drinks.\n\nKombucha and kefir drinks may not all be as healthy as people think\n\n\"When people think they are buying a soft drink that has no alcohol that is what they should get,\" Margaret Allman-Farinelli, Professor of Dietetics at the University of Sydney, told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\"With respect to cancer risk, the finding is there is no safe level of alcohol intake. The same applies for damage to the fetus during pregnancy.\"\n\nHigh in probiotics, kombucha has been lauded as a health drink that will improve your digestion, boost energy levels, and aid your overall wellbeing.\n\nHowever, not all forms of the the fizzy, fermented tea are as virtuous as you might think \u2014 some are high in sugar, and drinking too much can leave you bloated and cause bowel problems, as Insider's Gabby Landsverk previously reported.\n\nThat being said, studies have linked kombucha consumption with killing harmful microorganisms, improving liver and kidney function, and weight loss.\n\nIf you enjoy fermented drinks, you don't need to stop consuming them \u2014 it just might be worth factoring in that a buch or two on a Friday evening may mean you're not totally sober.\n\nRead more:\n\n6 potential health risks of drinking kombucha, from accidental tipsiness to uncomfortable bloating\n\nI lost 35 pounds in 6 months without going on a diet, and it taught me 7 lessons about eating for healthy fat loss\n\nHow calorie-counting actually helped me develop a healthier relationship with food", "description": "A study has found that popular fermented health drinks, often lauded for their gut-friendly properties, contain more alcohol than most people think.", "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e1215f4fc2476ff38b27b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
