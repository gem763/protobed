They have since said they will not back a national vote until no deal is taken off the table \u2014 for now \u2014 by legislation forced through by them, in alliance with rebel Conservatives, last week.\n\nThe legislation, known as the Benn Act, requires Johnson to ask the EU for an extension to the Article 50 process, delaying Brexit until January 2020 if no agreement with Brussels is in place by October 19. Opposition MPs want to see this extension come into force before backing an election.\n\nJohnson mocked opposition parties ahead of the vote, accusing them of \"preposterous cowardice\" for avoiding an election. \"The only possible explanation is that they fear we will win it,\" he said, and claimed they were trying to \"protect the British people from the consequences of their own democratic decisions.\"\n\nJohnson insisted again that he will not ask for a Brexit delay. It remains to be seen whether Johnson would indeed refuse to do so, even if he risked breaking the law.\n\nOpposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted an election but was \"not prepared to risk inflicting\" what he called \"the disaster of no deal\" on the country.\n\nThe vote against an early election was the last act of the current parliament, which has been suspended early by the queen at the request of Johnson's government. MPs will not convene again until October 14, when a queen's speech will be held to open a new session of parliament.\n\nAn election is still considered highly likely following parliament's return, but due to the required length of an election campaign cannot now take place till November.", "description": "An election is still considered highly likely following parliament\u2019s return.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166916427-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
