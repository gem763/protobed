As such, 4 million people do not have access to safe drinking water. Communities rely on contaminated water from rivers and wells; some may boil it before use, but this does not eliminate the arsenic that occurs naturally in the groundwater across much of the country.\n\nBut thanks to a collaboration between Watersprint and Shishir Water, thousands of people in Mymensingh, a city on the Brahmaputra River about 75 miles north of Dhaka, now have access to clean water \u2013 and at a reasonable price.\n\nBuilding on the 2014 Nobel prize-winning development of blue LEDs, Watersprint, a Swedish water purification company, has created technology that uses short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light to disinfect contaminated water.\n\n\u201cThree of the founders of the company started to experiment with UV-C and saw that it could be applicable on running water,\u201d says Pete Andersen, CEO of Watersprint, which is part of the Business Call to Action initiative.\n\nAfter developing its first working prototype in 2015, Watersprint has created three water purification products; the BakPak mobile unit, for use in natural disasters or extreme weather events; the YesBox, for flows of two to four litres per minute; and the Purify, which can process 20 litres of water per minute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watersprint\u2019s UV-LED technology is able to remove bacteria and viruses from water with very low energy consumption\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so-called \u2018point-of-use\u2019 technology,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cOur units sit as close to the tap as possible ... so as to minimise the risk of contamination in the last half metre.\u201d\n\nTen of these Purify models were bought by Shishir Water \u2013 a joint social business venture between the YY Goshti incubator and the Grameen Telecom Trust \u2013 for use in Bangladesh, at around \u20ac2,900 (\u00a32,500) each. Two of the units are now running on solar-driven batteries at a plant in Mymensingh, as part of Watersprint\u2019s goal to provide 50,000 people with clean and safe drinking water by 2020.\n\nShishir Water\u2019s business model is that the plant is run by an entrepreneur, identified through Grameen Telecom Trust\u2019s network, who then hires four or five staff members \u2013 usually young people from the local community. Equipped with Watersprint\u2019s purification unit, a water cooling machine, filters, water jars, and a water quality testing unit, as well as a pipeline from the river, a plant costs $20,000 (\u00a315,000) to set up. Of this, $5,000 is invested by the entrepreneur and $15,000 by Shishir Water, so that each party has a sense of ownership.\n\nShishir Water trains the entrepreneur to run the business and the water purification technology, and the young staff members take charge of marketing and running the delivery network \u2013 transporting water to smaller shops where it is sold.\n\nBut the partnership was not without its teething problems. \u201cThe number one challenge was dealing with different water qualities in Sweden, where the technology is made, and in Bangladesh, where the machine has been used,\u201d says Shazeeb M Khairul Islam, managing director of YY Goshti.\n\nEach time Islam\u2019s team tested the Purify unit, they failed to reach the quality of water they expected. Watersprint sent one of its technical experts, Mathias Lindqvist, to Bangladesh and together he and Shishir Water\u2019s staff tested eight samples of river water from different areas. They found that the source water, in all cases, had much higher levels of contamination than anticipated. Unfortunately, the only way the team has been able to achieve the disinfection grade expected from Watersprint\u2019s technology is by cleaning the water with non-toxic aluminium sulfate before passing it through the unit.\n\nThis has also affected the rate at which the water can be purified. \u201cOur understanding was that each minute the machine would produce 12 to 14 litres of water, but since the water quality is really bad, the machine produces five to six litres of water every minute,\u201d says Islam. \u201cThat\u2019s how we get the best quality water, which is drinkable, pure and safe.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning, people were reluctant to buy water from Shishir Water.\n\n\u201cWhen we started offering this to households, we thought that people would love the water, but people did not really accept it.\u201d says Islam. \u201cThey would say: \u2018This is river water, why are you charging us?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut by reaching out to other young people who could communicate the benefits of using purified river water, rather than relying on arsenic-laced groundwater, Shishir \u2013 a Bengali word meaning \u201cdew drop\u201d \u2013 was able to convince people to become customers.\n\nEmbracing innovation to tackle humanity\u2019s greatest challenges Read more\n\nIt also developed a tiered pricing model, to cross-subsidise the project and ensure its operational sustainability. Hospitals, schools, banks and other businesses are charged 40 cents per 20 litres, while the poorest in the community or those living in slums pay 10 cents.\n\nSolutions such as Watersprint may not then be a complete game-changer in bringing clean water \u2013 sustainably \u2013 to disadvantaged communities, but they can \u201cplay a useful role, provided they are part of a broader managed water supply service that has adequate arrangements in place for maintenance and a pro-poor tariff regime\u201d, says Vincent Casey, senior water, sanitation and hygiene manager for WaterAid.\n\nNow that the first plant in Mymensingh has reached operational sustainability, Shishir Water hopes to secure more funding to open more plants with the other eight units it has bought, expanding the network initially to Chandpur, south of Dhaka, and to Khulna in south-west Bangladesh. By the time all 10 units are in operation, Islam hopes there will be 60 full-time staff working in this water purification and delivery network, plus another 400 young retailers and resellers, across the country.\n\nAnd for Watersprint, by developing more contacts across Bangladesh and rolling out the second generation of its purification units, its goal of providing clean water to 50,000 people should be \u201can easy target\u201d, says Andersen.\n\n\u201cThey have the first generation products [in Bangladesh]. Now we have the second generation, with five-fold efficiency, so 50,000 people would not be out of the league at all.\u201d", "description": "Watersprint purifies contaminated water using technology based on blue LEDs, a development that won the Nobel prize in 2014.
