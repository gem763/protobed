In his eyes he\u2019s \u2018King Kev\u2019 \u2013 and he\u2019s done phenomenal routines with his previous partners.\"\n\nAll is not lost for Kevin though as he apparently has \"a friend for life in Anneka and he loved working with her.\"\n\nKevin will not bow out of Strictly completely though as he will now participate in group dances and the pros\u2019 performances.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
