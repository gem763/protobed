School has started. Students from coast to coast have returned to their college campuses, and the nation waits with bated breath as to what will happen next.\n\nWill the self-absorbed snowflake insanity persist? Will you continue to hear cries of \u201cyou offended me\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d in the halls of the academy? Will the demands for \u201csafe spaces\u201d continue to trump the study of science? Will the fixation on \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d continue to be more important than teaching morality? Will victimization continue to trump virtue?\n\nIn the days ahead, what will the news from the ivory tower be? If the old axiom that the best predictor of future behavior is always past behavior is true, here is just a shortlist of what you can expect in the coming weeks and months.\n\nStudents at Emory University will renew their cry for counseling because someone used chalk to write the name of an unpopular politician on a campus sidewalk.\n\nYoung intellectuals at Yale will continue to demand the termination of professors because of their \u201churtful\u201d views on such critical issues as Halloween costumes.\n\nSouthern Illinois University will double down on its brilliant plan to host campus \u201cnaps\u201d in its library so students can snuggle up together in sleeping bags as they seek to solve our nation\u2019s ills.\n\nIn the coming academic year, millennials from campuses across the land will persist in their juvenile fits of rage.\n\nAt American University, the University of Wyoming and the University of California-San Diego, burgeoning scholars will, once again, receive coloring books to help them cope with their stress and anxiety.\n\nAt Pitt, 18-year-olds will continue to block streets and destroy public property. They will then form \u201chealing circles\u201d because they feel \u201cunsafe,\u201d not because of their self-destructive lunacy, but because of the results of the most recent election they don\u2019t like.\n\nAt Berkeley, the \u201cbirthplace of the free speech movement,\u201d free speech will continue to be silenced as protesters attack any sad soul who dares promote the \u201cwrong\u201d speech.\n\nAt Virginia Tech and Michigan State, professors will tell first-year students to embrace identity politics and deny science. The result will be nothing less than total ontological chaos. Some co-eds will face expulsion for refusing to embrace the misogynistic \u201cpreferred personal pronouns\u201d of delusional men who want to pretend to be women.\n\nBiological facts will continue to be flushed down the toilet, as college bathrooms become laboratories for social experimentation and university classrooms become platforms for ideological indoctrination.\n\nIn the face of this nonsense, women will suffer first and suffer most. They will lose their facilities, lose their sports, lose their privacy and even lose their identity. And all who dare to suggest that a female is a fact and not a fabrication will be harassed into silence.\n\nYes, you will watch America\u2019s colleges prove over and over again that they are no longer bulwarks of free speech but rather bastions of speech codes.\n\nYou will see protests from Wellesley to Wake Forest simply because students don\u2019t like a given speaker who dares to arrive on campus with a contrary idea. Professors at the University of Missouri will call for \u201cmuscle\u201d to remove journalists who are just trying to do their jobs. Santa Clara and John Carroll will reject charters for conservative student clubs because their views might make someone feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nSchools such as the University of Northern Colorado will tell professors to stop asking students to examine varying viewpoints on such \u201ccontroversial issues\u201d as biological sex, the meaning of marriage and the dignity of human life. Even \u201cChristian\u201d colleges, such as the University of Northwestern-St. Paul, will refuse to allow conservative black speakers such as Star Parker on their campus because her views are considered too \u201cdivisive.\u201d\n\nThese stories will be endless. Millennials and GenZ\u2019ers, who feel uncomfortable with anything that challenges their narcissism, will demand to be coddled. Spineless college administrators and feckless faculty will readily comply.\n\nIt may be tempting to think this all foolish academic theater disconnected from the \u201creal world.\u201d But such dismissal would be a mistake.\n\nToday\u2019s law students and business majors will be tomorrow\u2019s judges and CEOs. The students who now want to ban Plato, Aristotle, Jefferson and Jesus from college curricula will soon be tomorrow\u2019s teachers. The protesters you see in tonight\u2019s news will be the politicians you see in tomorrow\u2019s Congress.\n\nNever forget this one rule: What is taught today in the classroom will be practiced tomorrow in our culture.\n\nIf we do not halt this slide into absurdity, our coddled campuses will produce a crippled America.\n\n\u2022 Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of \u201cNot A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth\u201d (Regnery 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
