He was good against South Africa in a very different contest but he is such a natural ball-handler, and when Brodie Retallick is fit again there is a real selection decision to be made. Can they fit him in at six? That Sam Cane-Ardie Savea combination has been working so well. Such ridiculous depth. 310 metres made in all for the Barrett brothers today, 169 from Beauden. A short turnaround for New Zealand, with their next game against Namibia coming in four days. I wonder how Steve Hansen might shuffle his pack. Richie Mo'unga and Beauden Barrett have played consecutive 80 minutes in tandem, and I've a sneaking suspicion we will see either Jordie Barrett or Ryan Crotty at ten against the Namibians, probably the former. Advertisement Nine tries for New Zealand, and a 63-0 bonus point victory. Very much what you would have expected from the All Blacks, and they left points out there. As I understand it the betting handicap was -68 - a few angry punters, I'm sure, after those late drops from Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett. But back to the important stuff - New Zealand were very good, Canada fought hard, the ball was slippery. Straightforward stuff. FULL TIME FULL TIME: New Zealand 63-0 Canada 81 minutes Both sides spill the ball with the try line begging as a game of basketball breaks out! Beauden Barrett's is awful. He races away from the Canadian defence and is ready to canter home but drops the ball without a player within five metres of him. Canada boot the ball out, and that'll do us. Advertisement 79 minutes Another New Zealand drop with door agape - Ardie Savea sees the ball slip from his grasp after fine interplay from Ben Smith and co down the left touchline. 77 minutes Like playing in the Barrett backyard - Beauden chips for Jordie, Jordie catches and offloads to Scott, who looks for another brother in support, but finds only Canadian hands. There is a fourth brother, Kane, who is the oldest of the quartet, but he had a more middling rugby career with province Taranaki and a couple of appearances for the Blues of Auckland. Where were you Kane? Where were you... 75 minutes An odd quirk of this New Zealand team now is that they have full-backs (Jordie Barrett and Ben Smith) on the wing and a fly-half at full-back in Beauden Barrett. Peculiar. Still, Barrett the eldest takes well in the air as Canada launch a high bomb, but Atu Moli is pinged for an offence at the break down. 73 minutes The All Blacks are seeking their tenth try, but Canada are defending better than they have all game. Ben Smith is well put down on the left. Ooh - that's nasty! A clash of heads between Taylor Paris and Ardie Savea leaves the Canadian back sprawled on the floor. He's groggy as he is seen to by medics. He'll go off for an HIA. The Castres flyer is one of Canada's better players, but a lower leg injury kept him out of the Italy clash and he's off here, and not looking particularly good. Hopefully he'll be able to figure at some point before the tournament is over. Advertisement 71 minutes That should have been the hat-trick! Kieran Read from the base, to Brad Weber, to Richie Mo'unga, flat pass to Ben Smith, back inside to Weber... Dropped. The pass is just behind him and he can't grab it. Weber shakes his head. 70 minutes A powerful charge from Ciaran Hearn gives Canada quick ball, but Peter Nelson's pass is behind his runner and the ball is knocked on. Here comes Savea and a couple of others. Liam Coltman is on at hooker, and Sam Whitelock in the row. Ardie Save is being readied, with the goggles on. He's been, for my money, the best player in the world this year, and the fact he's done it without being able to see properly is a little bit scary. He's not with us just yet as Canada set a scrum near halfway. 67 minutes Nearly! New Zealand are preoccupied with the scrum and Jeff Hassler escapes down the right, and his chip ahead is his or the touchline's, with no All Blacks near. But the bounce is unkind! Over the white line it hops with Hassler running his hands through the long flowing locks in frustration. Advertisement 66 minutes This time Ioane is over, but Richie Mo'unga's pass is forward! A sharply-executed move to the blindside from the base of a stable scrum, and Mo'unga tries to get his arms through the tackle to release his flying winger, but can't quick work the ball backwards. Forward pass, Canada scrum. 64 minutes Twice the All Blacks loose the ball with line in sight - first Jordie Barrett flings a no-look, out the back offload from the floor right into a Canadian before Rieko Ioane fails to gather a Shannon Frizell offload. 61 minutes A few changes as the game just settles a little bit. New Zealand have made four times as many metres as Canada, and got over the gainline nearly seven times more often. Dominance. 59 minutes New Zealand take down the restart and set up a maul, which Canada can only stop illegally Otherwise that might just have kept going.
