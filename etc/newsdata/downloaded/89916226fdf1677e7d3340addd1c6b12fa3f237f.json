Trump then declared a national emergency at the border, giving himself authority to divert funds from other parts of the government to deal with the emergency. The declaration is being challenged in the courts.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) criticized Esper\u2019s decision.\n\n\"This decision will harm already planned, important projects intended to support our service members at military installations in New York, across the United States, and around the world,\" Schumer said. \"The president is trying to usurp Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse and loot vital funds from our military. Robbing the Defense Department of much-needed funds is an affront to our service members and Congress will strongly oppose any funds for new wall construction.\u201d\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also denounced the move.\n\n\u201cThis administration is trying to circumvent Congressional authority and this ill-advised attempt should be legally challenged and struck down by the courts,\" Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.\n\nThe ACLU announced that it will ask a judge to block use of the funds as part of an ongoing lawsuit challenging the border wall\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government sat on these so-called \u2018emergency funds\u2019 for seven months further confirms that this is nothing but an unlawful power grab,\" ACLU attorney Dror Ladin said. \"We\u2019ll be back in court very soon to block Trump\u2019s latest effort to raid military funds for his xenophobic wall.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Trump administration to divert $3.6 billion to build border wall with Mexico.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/AP19207825601598.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
