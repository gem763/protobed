Photographers stories of capturing extreme weather 1/8 \"I stumbled on the firefighter in front of the burning home on the second day of the Camp Fire in a town called Magalia which is about five miles from Paradise, California. There were about five or six homes burning and firefighters were trying to save the houses near to those that were on fire. The heat from the fire was so intense that the firefighter could only stand near the burning building for 10-15 seconds before having to move away\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 2/8 \"This was only one of several large-scale forest fires in Brandenburg state in Germany last year, following droughts which left the forests in the region extremely dry. The year set a new record for fires that burned over 400 hectares. As a photojournalist covering the region for over 15 years, I now have to assume either drought or floods will very likely be a part of the news we will be covering every summer\" - Sean Gallup Getty 3/8 \"This photograph was taken at a sunflower field at Goersdorf near Golssen in Germany. The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue\" - Sean Gallup Getty 4/8 \"On the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills. I captured this photo in Big Bend, as the story was shifting away from the fire itself and focusing on trying to locate missing persons and recover remains of those who had perished\" - Justin Sullivan Getty 5/8 \"You can see the Belchatow power plant and the rising steam and smoke from over 20km away. I went there the day before the start of the United Nations\u2019 climate conference in Katowice, which took place in a region where coal has a long history and coal mining is woven into local tradition. Poland has made some strides with renewables, such as with wind turbines that now dot portions of the western Polish countryside. However, given how heavily Poland still relies on coal, it is unlikely that Belchatow will close anytime soon.

It is now sinking towards southern Scotland so there is some heavy rainfall across the central belt today.\n\n\u201cA bit of dry weather is pushing in this afternoon. Still got some showers to come this weekend but many places are going to stay dry with some sunny spells.\u201d\n\nThe recent bout of rain has been caused by an unsettled jet stream across the UK but as that settles, the weather is set to be drier but also colder.\n\nMs Mitchell said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got high pressure on Monday and Tuesday and it\u2019s going to be quite chilly overnight with frosts across the north.\n\n\u201cReally from Sunday night we could see temperatures drop to -4C or -5C in parts of Scotland and northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nBy day it\u2019s going to start feeling colder as winter approaches with temperatures struggling to get above 12 or 13 degrees which is colder than we\u2019ve been experiencing so far.\n\nAnother band of rain is expected to sweep across Scotland next week.", "description": "Scotland has been soaked by 24 hours of wet weather\u00a0as a band of \u201cheavy and persistent\u201d rain\u00a0sweeps the country with flood warnings issued in\u00a0north eastern parts of the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The police has\u00a0told\u00a0motorists to keep off parts of\u00a0the A93\u00a0which runs through Aberdeenshire because flooding had made it \u201cimpassible\u201d.\u00a0 Further heavy rain is forecast across Aberdeenshire, Dundee", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/19/10/Oxford-flood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
