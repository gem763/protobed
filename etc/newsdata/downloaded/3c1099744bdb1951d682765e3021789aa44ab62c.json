Beat the bug.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has declared war on the invasive spotted lanternfly, but southeastern Pennsylvania seems to be losing the fight.\n\nThe enemy\n\nTwenty-two counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are under quarantine\u2014meaning trucks have to follow special shipping rules\u2014and sightings have been confirmed in Delaware and Virginia. The country-loving insects, originally from India, China and Vietnam, have even recently been spotted in downtown Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI try and step on them all the time,\u201d said Robin Hyndman, in Allentown, Pa. \u201cThis is the second\u201d\u2014pausing to stomp on one\u2014\u201cyear they\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nVideos on social media reveal scenes on the front lines. In one Instagram post, a man approaches a tree covered with spotted lanternflies. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d he says, pointing to the insects. \u201cSomebody has got to die.\u201d He takes a lighter to a spray can and fries the bugs with a burst of flame.\n\nIn a post on the \u201cStop the Spotted Lanternfly\u201d Facebook group, a man shows a 10 foot PVC pipe modified to attach to a vacuum cleaner so it could reach trees: \u201c400 less bugs today!\u201d the poster writes.\n\nEntomologist Heather Leach holds two spotted lanternflies.

There are millions of spotted lanternflies in the region\u2014laying eggs in the fall and hatching in early summer. By July, they are fully grown into inch-long adults, spotted on the outside with a flame red patch under the wings. They suck on the sap of trees and excrete a sticky residue called \u201choneydew\u201d\u2014bad for the trees and the cars parked below them.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s agricultural department said the bugs threaten to destroy $18 billion in plant-based commodities in the state.\n\nRichard Blair \u2019s Setter Ridge Vineyards in Kutztown, Pa., was one of the first places to see the spotted lanternfly in 2014. Back then, it was a trickle. By the summer of 2017, one of Mr. Blair\u2019s two vineyard locations was a total loss.\n\nA fly swatter is now a permanent fixture on a wooden post on the estate\u2019s veranda. \u201cWe play a game to see how many we can kill in 60 seconds,\u201d Mr. Blair said.\n\nTwenty miles east in Allentown, a city of 120,000, the newly revitalized downtown is full of people smushing bugs. On a recent afternoon, one man hopped around trying to avoid the dead carcasses on the sidewalk. Another woman swung her body to and fro to avoid the erratic flight of a spotted lanternfly.\n\nHundreds of dead bugs lay on the ground next to shimmering new buildings, evidence of direct extermination efforts.\n\n\u201cThe numbers were astounding,\u201d said Pat Harris, of Enviro-Tech Pest Services, a company hired to combat the infestation around the downtown with pesticide. \u201cWe are cleaning up hundreds each day, and sometimes in the thousands.\u201d\n\nIn the 2000s, the insect spread across South Korea within three years. The country, which covers about the same area as Pennsylvania, still sees regular outbreaks.\n\nThey consistently flummox quarantine efforts by being able to lay eggs on almost any surface and move long distances on infested materials. The USDA has declared them \u201chitchhiking pests.\u201d\n\nHeather Leach, an entomologist with Penn State University who specializes in the spotted lanternfly, is part of a 150-person effort by the U.S. and Pennsylvania Departments of Agriculture and Penn State to study the bug and ultimately, they hope, control its spread.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What\u2019s the grossest bug infestation story you have? Join the conversation below.\n\nMs. Leach has seen all types of ways to kill the insects: guns that shoot grains of salt, bonfires, bleach, kerosene, WD-40. \u201cIt just seems like no matter what we do, they keep coming,\u201d she said.\n\nNone of those methods are endorsed by agricultural authorities or the experts at Penn State. Officials there are still looking for the best way to eradicate the problem\u2014including an indigenous fungus that would be sprayed in the area.\n\nSome locals are making the best of a messy situation. Artist Elsab\u00e9 J. Dixon is working on an installment composed almost entirely of dead spotted lanternflies, funded by a grant from Penn State Lehigh Valley and the affected communities.\n\nArt by Elsab\u00e9 J. Dixon uses the wings of spotted lanternflies. Photo: Amy Gery/Penn State Lehigh Valley\n\nFor the piece, Ms. Dixon is affixing the bug\u2019s red and black wings in six circles. She estimates the smallest of the six circles in the art piece, measuring just one foot in diameter, contains as many as 5,000 wings.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a superbug,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s moving and spreading like wildfire.\u201d\n\nJulie Foster, the co-owner of Tired Hands Brewing Company in Ardmore, Pa., began selling Spotted Lanternfly IPA in 2018 to raise awareness of the species. Although she admires the insect\u2019s beauty, Ms. Foster said she has used a blowtorch to \u201cgreat effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI killed so many last summer that when I closed my eyes some nights, all I could see was the lanternflies,\u201d Ms. Foster said.\n\nA scoreboard showed how many spotted lanternflies the employees of Molly\u2019s Irish Grille & Sports Pub in Bethlehem, Pa., have killed.

It\u2019s topped with two candy eyeballs. Asked if the shot tastes good, Ms. Nagai said, \u201cNo. But it\u2019s not supposed to because the lanternflies suck, too.\u201d\n\nWrite to Talal Ansari at Talal.Ansari@wsj.com", "description": "Grossed-out residents resort to flamethrowers and giant vacuums but the pest just keeps coming. \u201cStop.
