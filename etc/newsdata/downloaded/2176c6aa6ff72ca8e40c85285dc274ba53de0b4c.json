She's also landed at the top of \"best dressed\" lists and even recently revealed that she's building a fashion \"playground\" at her Las Vegas home.\n\nOn her fashion sense, Dion told ET in a recent interview: \"I dress for me, the way I feel...I want to feel that I feel great about myself, I feel strong about myself, I feel good about my decisions with the help of a lot of people.\"\n\n\"It's all about courage and I think everyone should feel like that,\" she added.\n\nThe superstar works with close friend and stylist Pepe Mu\u00f1oz and Sydney Lopez to create some of her most talked about looks.\n\nHer relationship with Mu\u00f1oz has also been the topic of many tabloid reports, so much so, that her team issued a response on Dion's Instagram account, slamming reports that he is too controlling over her life.\n\n\"We met and we bonded as best friends,\" Dion told ET on the beginning of her friendship with the stylist. \"We were laughing constantly, we had to be like children! 'Pay attention! Calm down!' And then he became my stylist, my friend, dancing with me, illustrator, I mean, and now he's part of also two productions, doing quite a bit.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Dion also spoke about her love life and whether she feels she'll ever want to find a match again after losing her late husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil in 2016.\n\n\"I still feel today I have been, still, the luckiest woman in the world as far as I\u2019m concerned because I have dated the best man in the world -- the father of my children,\" she told the outlet.\n\n\"And every day, I still see him because my three children, they look so much like him, and do so many things just like him, and this is just amazing,\" she added. \"He was a very exceptional man.\"\n\nHowever, she doesn't rule out love in the future.\n\n\"Am I going to love again? I am in love, I am in love with my life, I am in love with my children, I\u2019m in love with my work,\" she told ET. \"Am I going to have a partner in my life? We'll stay tuned and if I do, I will share it and it would be a pleasure to share it. It's a chapter that's closed, but it's not something that's dead.\"\n\n\"You evolve and maybe sometimes you meet a friend and it turns out into something bigger than that,\" she added. \"Who knows and maybe not? But I will let you know. I promise.\"", "description": "The singer spoke about her eccentric fashion sense and close bond with her stylist Pepe Mu\u00f1oz.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/celine-dion-file-gty-ml-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
