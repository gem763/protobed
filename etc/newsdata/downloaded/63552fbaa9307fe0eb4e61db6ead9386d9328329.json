Photo: Gary Gershoff/Getty Images\n\nThe greatest joke writer of his generation has lined up his next comedy special, and it involves some help from a bunch of children. Esquire published a lengthy profile with John Mulaney today, and while the piece is jam-packed with tons of interesting information (Did you know Mulaney donated to Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primaries and is willing to get into a lengthy, meticulous, mathematical conversation about using the word \u201cgay\u201d in a joke?), the biggest bit of news is that, following his 2018 Netflix stand-up special Kid Gorgeous, Mulaney is shifting gears to a slightly different format: a children\u2019s variety show. From Esquire:\n\nMulaney, thirty-seven, is modeling the new special on the entertainment he loved growing up: 3-2-1 Contact, the eighties-era PBS after-school classic; Really Rosie, a 1980 musical by Maurice Sendak and Carole King; and, of course, Sesame Street. \u201cIt\u2019s been on TV how many \u2014 fifty years?\u201d Mulaney tells me later. He\u2019s been rewatching old episodes recently, in thrall to their elastic approach to narrative. \u201cIt\u2019s modular, fast-paced. Bizarrely paced,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll cut to a kid who blows up a balloon, draws a smiley face on it, and pops it. Like, \u2018Great, love it, moving on!\u2019\u201d With the new show, he wants to make something that will appeal to kids and adults alike. His thinking is twofold. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019d like to watch,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t wanna do anything anyone else is doing.\u201d\n\nThe profile includes moments where Mulaney and a group of child actors rehearse the special that will feature musical bits and sketches, like one where a kid does a book report on Joan Didion\u2019s A Year of Magical Thinking having thought it was a book of magic tricks. \u201cSomeone said to me, \u2018You know you mention Joan Didion three times in this special, right?\u2019\u201d Mulaney said. \u201cWe probably have to cut one of those.\u201d\n\nRead the rest of the profile over at Esquire.", "description": "In a new profile at Esquire, stand-up comedian John Mulaney revealed that his next comedy special will take on the form of a children\u2019s variety show.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-john-mulaney-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
