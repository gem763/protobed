Day was attended to by medical personnel before he was taken from the arena on a stretcher. He was reported to have remained unconscious, and suffered seizures as an ambulance transported him to the hospital.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClaudia Trejos gives us an update on Patrick Day.\n\n\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with Patrick and his family. \ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/Xqee6iuJqs \u2014 DAZN USA (@DAZN_USA) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\u201d DiBella Entertainment said. \u201cThis is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action. While we don\u2019t have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\n\n\u201cThis is a way we can honor the legacy of Pat Day. Many people live much longer than Patrick\u2019s 27 years, wondering if they made a difference or positively affected their world. This was not the case for Patrick Day when he left us. Rest in peace and power, Pat, with the angels.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the 21-year-old Conwell posted a lengthy message to social media about Day. A 2016 Olympian, Conwell said he considered quitting boxing but decided that wasn\u2019t what Day, as \u201ca fighter at heart,\u201d would want.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI never meant for this to happen to you. All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would,\u201d Conwell wrote. \u201cNo one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you.\u201d\n\nDay posted a record of 17-4-1 after starting his professional career in 2013. He won the World Boxing Council Continental Americas championship in 2017 and the International Boxing Federation Intercontinental championship earlier this year, according to DiBella Entertainment. Before that, he was a 2012 New York Golden Gloves winner at 152 pounds and was also an alternate that year for the U.S. Olympic team.\n\nRest In Peace.\n\n\n\nPatrick Day was always kind, happy and an exceptional good man who was outstandingly passionate about boxing. We will always remember you for all of that. pic.twitter.com/v506g26nmX \u2014 World Boxing Council (@WBCBoxing) October 16, 2019\n\nDay\u2019s trainer, Joe Higgins, was not immediately available for comment. He recently told ESPN that Day grew up across the street from him in Freeport, N.Y., and wandered over as a 14-year-old to try out the punching bag hanging in the trainer\u2019s garage. Higgins soon had Day enrolled at the local Police Athletic League gym.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m responsible, like I let him down,\u201d Higgins told ESPN, via text message. \u201cMy special kid.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, DiBella Entertainment described Day as a \u201ca dedicated college student,\u201d who earned an associate degree and a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n\u201cPatrick Day didn\u2019t need to box,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe came from a good family, he was smart, educated, had good values and had other avenues available to him to earn a living.\n\n\u201cHe chose to box, knowing the inherent risks that every fighter faces when he or she walks into a boxing ring. Boxing is what Pat loved to do. It\u2019s how he inspired people and it was something that made him feel alive.\u201d\n\nDay\u2019s death is the latest in a string of recent fatalities in the sport. Maxim Dadashev, a 28-year-old Russian, died in July, after he underwent surgery for massive head trauma following a fight at MGM National Harbor casino in Oxon Hill, Md. And 23-year-old Hugo Santillan reportedly suffered cardiorespiratory failure after fighting to a draw in his native Argentina just days after Dadashev\u2019s death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bulgarian boxer, Boris Stanchov, reportedly died in the ring in September during a fight in Albania. The WBC initially posted a message mourning the loss of another boxer, Isus Velichkov, but according to reports, Velichkov came forward and said Stanchov was a relative who had been fighting under his license.\n\nDay\u2019s death prompted an outpouring of messages of grief Wednesday from the boxing community, many of whom remembered Day for his friendly, engaging personality.\n\nThis isn\u2019t our only pic together but let me tell y\u2019all he had no problem chasing you down at the Barclays \ud83d\ude2d just to say hi and give a hug! I\u2019ll miss Pat, and his DMs and him cracking jokes. This sport is so cruel.

We know the sport saves souls, every day, and is a refuge for people who fall in between life's too copious cracks. \u2014 Michael Woods (@Woodsy1069) October 16, 2019\n\nDevastated to hear the news of the passing of Patrick Day.I met him for the first time last Thursday,what a charming young man with a dream and a smile that lit up the room.Our deepest prayers are with his family, his trainer Joe Higgins,Charles Conwell and promoter Lou DiBella\ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Eddie Hearn (@EddieHearn) October 16, 2019\n\nRest in paradise @patday_allday.

He would talk with anyone and he would be smiling the whole time he was talking with you. His smile was his trademark.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "\"Pat\u2019s kindness, positivity, and generosity of spirit made a lasting impression with everyone he met,\" Day's manager said of the 27-year-old Long Island native, who was taken from the ring on a stretcher after a loss to Charles Conwell.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iyUVVMwVczd58Q4NucpwMBhu7ec=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V6KJSNHQOYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
