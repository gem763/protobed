I didn't wear sunglasses, I've just worn my everyday glasses and I know it's not forever, it's only until the prosthetic eye is fitted.\n\n\"I fought my demons, and every day, I pushed myself to go out and slowly but surely, I started feeling more confident.\"\n\nClaire and Timothy, 52, have been to Turkey every year for the past 15 years.\n\nIt was the first day of their annual break in July when tragedy struck after Claire showered in their hotel room in preparation of going to meet friends.\n\nShe felt a popping sensation in her right eye, leading to a horrific amount of pain and a cloudiness of her vision.\n\nBin man Timothy rushed his blinded wife to the local hospital where an examination revealed that Claire had perforated her cornea.\n\nDevastated Claire was advised to return home to the UK immediately for medical attention and within hours, she was on a flight home with a huge bandage over her poorly eye.\n\nShe said: \"We'd only been in Turkey for a few hours when I hurt my eye, and we didn't get to enjoy any of our holiday before I had my accident.\n\n\"My vision had turned cloudy after I felt the pop, but then everything started going dark, and by the time we got to the Turkish hospital, all I could see was blurry lights.\n\n(Image: Claire Willis / SWNS)\n\n\"I've suffered with dry eyes in the past and just used eye drops, but never experienced anything like this.\n\n\"I was heartbroken when the doctor told me to go back to the UK, but I knew it was for the best.\n\n\"Thomas Cook were amazing, our hotel rep came straight to the hospital and got us on the next flight home.\n\n\"My eye was all bandaged up so I could fly, which was mortifying, but I just wanted to get to the hospital and get it all sorted so I could book a replacement holiday.\"\n\nClaire went straight to Royal Stoke University Hospital when she landed where doctors were shocked to see how infected her eye had become during the flight.\n\nHer right eye was fused shut with infection, forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open to get a look at her eyeball which had turned completely yellow.\n\nClaire spent the next nine days in hospital as doctors tried to fight the infection, but it was no use, and the suggestion of amputation was made.\n\nShe said: \"I felt so isolated in the hospital, and when they suggested amputation, I was totally against the idea.\n\n\"My dad ended up convincing me to have the eyeball amputated, and although I was devastated at the idea, I was in so much pain that I knew it needed to be done.\n\n\"There was no saving my sight, but the surgeon decided to perform a partial removal of my eyeball rather than a full one.\n\n\"He removed the middle of my eye - the retina and cornea - and fitted a cosmetic shell over the lens of my eye.\"\n\nClaire's surgery was a success, and she was allowed to return home just one day after her operation.\n\n(Image: Claire Willis / SWNS)\n\nShe had to keep the bandages on for another week after surgery, and it wasn't until eight days following the removal that Claire was able to look in the mirror.\n\nThe shock of her new appearance was devastating as Claire struggled to adjust to the idea of living with one real eye for the rest of her life.\n\nBrave Claire is now battling on to get her life back on track after the trauma of losing her eye, but the adjustment has been difficult.\n\nShe returned to work three weeks after her amputation, but her body was weakened by the tragic events and she was forced to give up one of her jobs.\n\nDesperate to not have their annual holiday taken so suddenly, Claire and Timothy rebooked flights to Turkey as soon as she was given the all clear to fly.\n\nTragedy struck again as Thomas Cook announced their collapse just five days before they were due to fly on 28 September.\n\nDevastated but determined, the couple are now searching for another holiday and have their fingers crossed for third time lucky.\n\nClaire said: \"I'm still at my cleaning job for the council, but I gave up my school cleaning job - I was struggling mentally and physically, and I just couldn't cope with two jobs any more.\n\n\"My eye isn't ready yet to have a prosthetic fitted, so I just have to wait and stay looking like this until my socket has recovered enough, but I don't know when that will be.\n\n\"Timothy has been so supportive throughout it all, and our two children, Ben, 22, and Daniel, 20, still live at home so they've been helping me lots around the house.\n\n\"All we wanted was to go back on holiday and still try to have some fun this year, and our bags were all packed ready to go when Thomas Cook collapsed a few days before we were due to fly.\n\n\"It was just yet another thing to go wrong, but I'm trying to stay positive and we're looking for another holiday deal before the year is over.\"\n\nAn ophthalmologist from Royal Stoke University Hospital said: \"This lady had particular circumstances that led to a thinner than normal cornea in her case.\"", "description": "WARNING -
