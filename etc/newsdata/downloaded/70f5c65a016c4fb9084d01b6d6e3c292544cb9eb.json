Those that beat the threshold will receive credits; those that fail to achieve it will pay a $30-per-tonne tax. The government will allocate $228 million of the $550 million in expected revenue toward \u201cinnovation and technology.\u201d (Calgary Herald, Star Edmonton)\n\nTalking point: The province estimates the new program will cost businesses $300 million less than the federal carbon tax, which it is designed to prevent Ottawa from imposing. But it\u2019s also making a big bet on innovation paying off. It forecasts technology will reduce 25 megatonnes of annual emissions by 2030, compared to between 32 and 57 megatonnes for TIER itself. To try and achieve that, Emissions Reduction Alberta, the arm\u2019s-length agency which will allocate most of the new money, said it is likely to fund carbon-capture and -storage research, rather than the cleantech commercialization it emphasized under the previous NDP government.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
