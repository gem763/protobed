Or your boss might yell at you over a seemingly minor blunder, causing you an undue amount of stress and misery.\n\nAlthough it's one thing to occasionally get mistreated at the office, it's another thing to have it happen constantly. Once a pattern of ill-treatment emerges, it can quickly cross over to bullying.\n\nUnfortunately, bullying isn't something that happens just in the schoolyard. Ninety perecent of employees say they've been bullied by a coworker or a manager, according to new data from Monster. That's problematic for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, it can make your job unbearable. Second, it could drive you away. In fact, 65% of bullied employees lose their jobs, often because they leave voluntarily to avoid further mistreatment but sometimes because they're actually terminated by their employers.\n\nIf you've been a victim of workplace bullying, you should know that you don't have to take it lying down. The sooner you stand up for yourself, the less you'll suffer needlessly on the job.\n\nSooner than you think:Holiday sales expected to hit record levels in 2019, but prices may be higher\n\nRetirement:Only 1 in 5 Americans achieve this financial goal\n\n1. Document all incidents of bullying\n\nIf your colleagues or manager treat you poorly, it's time to start establishing a record of that bad behavior. Write down the date, time, and details of every incident that involves bullying. Be sure to list the people involved, and include any witnesses who might be willing to corroborate your story. Save all emails that contain inappropriate or overly harsh language.\n\n2. Go to Human Resources\n\nYour HR department is there for a reason \u2013 to protect you from mistreatment that violates company policy. If your colleagues are doing the bullying, your first step can be to go to your boss, who might call a meeting with HR to discuss things. If your manager is the problem, HR is your best bet, and you'll want to bring the aforementioned bullying record with you to shed light on the situation.\n\n3. When all else fails, seek legal action\n\nDepending on the nature of the bullying in question, you may have an actual legal complaint on your hands. If you bring the matter to HR and no action is taken on your employer's part, then you may want to consult an employment lawyer to advise you.\n\nBeing bullied at work can be a miserable situation. If your boss or colleagues treat you poorly by calling you names, shaming you in public, sabotaging your work efforts or engaging in other behavior that's clearly inappropriate, don't let things reach the point where you dread going to the office every day.
