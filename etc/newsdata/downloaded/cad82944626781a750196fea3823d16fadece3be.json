In an exclusive interview, top Facebook executives said the company has made progress addressing false posts but still struggles to identify them, especially in the most high-stakes regions where misinformation can lead to deadly violence.\n\n\u201cWe don't want to be in the position of determining what is true and what is false for the world,\u201d says Monika Bickert, the head of global policy management, which sets the rules for the site\u2019s 2.4 billion users. \u201cWe don't think we can do it effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hear from people that they don't necessarily want a private company making that decision,\u201d she adds.\n\nReluctant to judge veracity on its platform, Facebook partners with fact-checking organizations that vet posts, an arrangement that began after the 2016 presidential election. But Bickert acknowledged that the company often lacks such partnerships in violence-prone regions.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is, in the places in the world where you are most likely to have on the ground violence, those are often the same places where it's hard to have a fact-checking partner, or even a safety organization, tell us what the real situation is on the ground,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Head of Policy Managment Monika Bickert participates in a discussion and question-and-answer session about 'Internet Security and Privacy in the Age of Islamic State' at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy February 26, 2016 in Washington, DC.

Human Rights experts examining violence perpetrated against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar said that social media played a \u201cdetermining role\u201d in the conflict. Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, specified: \u201cAs far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media.\u201d\n\nA Facebook-commissioned report, released last November, acknowledged that the company had failed to prevent the platform from \u201cbeing used to foment division and incite offline violence\u201d in Myanmar.\n\n\u201cIf we have misinformation where a safety partner is able to confirm that can contribute to imminent or ongoing violence on the ground, then we will remove it,\u201d Bickert says.\n\nConcerns about false and inauthentic posts on Facebook reached a fever pitch after the 2016 presidential election, the outcome of which some have attributed to a disinformation campaign on the platform carried out by a Russian intelligence agency. The Mueller Report, released in April, detailed Russia-operated Facebook Groups like \u201cUnited Muslims of America\u201d and \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d that each had hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nThis picture taken on December 18, 2018 shows Myanmar youths browsing their Facebook page at an internet shop in Yangon.

(Facebook reduced the distribution of such videos and attached a warning to them, but did not remove them.)\n\nIn an exclusive interview at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer spoke with the three executives who oversee content at Facebook \u2014 Bickert; John DeVine, VP of Global Operations; and Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity.", "description": "In an exclusive interview, top Facebook executives said the company has made progress addressing false posts but still struggles to identify them.", "authors": ["Max Zahn With Andy Serwer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.A.Fw89x.0MPWy247XJ62g--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5afae9e0-d3b7-11e9-bfff-6c6238ebbce2", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
