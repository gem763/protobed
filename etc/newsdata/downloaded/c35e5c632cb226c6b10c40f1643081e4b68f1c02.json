Gen. Dave Hodne, director of the Soldier Lethality Cross-Functional Team and chief of infantry at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, Georgia, told an AUSA audience, Military.com\u2019s reported Oct. 18.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there were some aspects of last year\u2019s AUSA where some would say what we are pursuing was unachievable, and I would tell you those impossibilities are on the floor here today,\u201d he added from the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWriter Matthew Cox noted that Sig Sauer\u2019s offering was \u201cthe most traditional out of all three competitors since Sig\u2019s rifle variant is an M4-style design.\u201d\n\nPaul Snyder, product manager for Sig Saur\u2019s belt-fed systems, added that his company is the only one who didn\u2019t team up on logistics with outside companies.\n\n\u201cEverything on the table today is Sig,\u201d he said, Military.com reported. \u201cWe are the only ones that haven\u2019t partnered up with anyone. This is all Sig \u2014 Sig guns, Sig suppressor, Sig ammo, Sig accessories.\u201d\n\nOfficials are expected to decide on one company for fulfillment by the first quarter of 2022.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
