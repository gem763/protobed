He\u2019d spend hours perusing the selections, admiring the VHS cover designs, asking the clerks for recommendations, and whittling down the choices to one rental, which he\u2019d bring home and watch with his family.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Gomez looked on as Netflix all but killed the video store. By 2014, Blockbuster had shut nearly all of its franchise locations. (Today, one remains in Bend, Oregon.) For Gomez\u2014and movie lovers everywhere\u2014the death of the video store heralded the end of an era. Algorithms were replacing the human interactions that made picking a movie an enjoyable experience. You used to be able to walk into a video store without knowing what to rent; a video-store clerk might recommend something unique to your preferences, and you\u2019d be on your way to a new cinematic discovery. These days, it\u2019s an effort to make an informed decision about what to watch. The endless barrage of content that modern streaming services offer induces a kind of browsing fatigue in which choice can feel paralyzing.\n\nWhen Gomez moved to a small town outside Philadelphia, he lamented its lack of a video store. So he opened one himself. Roy Power\u2019s short documentary Memory Video is a portrait of Gomez and his homespun operation\u2014one of the last rental stores of its kind.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of people that see us as a museum or a curiosity,\u201d Gomez says in the film. \u201cThey step in and want to feel the vibe of a video store. I prefer folks that I can recommend something to. I adore that sort of thing\u2014turning people on to things that I think are really cool. Every one of those interactions reminds me of why a video store is awesome and why I need to keep one going.\u201d\n\nGomez\u2019s store, Viva Video, is more passion project than profit-making venture. It doesn\u2019t pay the bills, so Gomez moonlights as a registered nurse. \u201cI basically volunteer for Viva Video because I want it to be around,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen Power first visited Viva Video, he was struck by its lack of pretension. \u201cYou can go in there and talk about Terrence Malick, or you can talk about Armageddon, or you can even talk about Netflix, and there\u2019s no judgment,\u201d Power told me. \u201cEveryone there just loves movies, no questions asked.\u201d Power said the store\u2019s customer base attracts a diverse demographic, from families looking to rent Disney movies to \u201cnerds like me who come in to rent old Herzog documentaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a friendly community center for anything and everything movie-related,\u201d said Power. In this way, Viva Video is not only an anomaly\u2014it is an embodiment of what disappeared when streaming took over.", "description": "A Philadelphia man keeps the dream of the video store alive.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/MemVid_Hi_Res_For_Atlantic/video-featured.jpg"}
