(Harry How/Getty Images)\n\nChris Thompson didn\u2019t find out until Monday morning that the Washington Redskins had fired Jay Gruden five games into his sixth season, but the running back had a sense that change was imminent when he was asked about his coach\u2019s future after Washington\u2019s 33-7 loss to the Patriots on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI feel like he was one of the guys that really believed in me, and wanted me to stay here and be with him through his whole legacy here as a coach,\u201d Thompson said in the locker room, fighting off tears.\n\nChris Thompson broke into tears when discussing Gruden after the game pic.twitter.com/rlsUNHTl0U \u2014 Matthew Paras (@Matthew_Paras) October 6, 2019\n\nThompson, who spent most of Gruden\u2019s first season with the Redskins in 2014 on the practice squad before blossoming into a versatile threat out of the backfield, explained his raw emotions in the wake of Gruden\u2019s firing on Monday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s frustration of losing, it\u2019s a whole lot of stuff, and beyond that, I think some people don\u2019t understand,\u201d Thompson told the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cThis is my seventh year now. It\u2019s beyond football. You start to love people, you start to care about people that\u2019s in that building that you get to come to work with and see every single day. It was more than having that feeling that they were going to move on from him. Whether that happened now or 10 games from now and we had a bad season, it was probably going to happen.\u201d\n\n[The Redskins are starting over after firing Jay Gruden, but in what direction are they headed?]\n\nA fifth-round draft pick by the Redskins in 2013, Thompson reiterated that he appreciated Gruden\u2019s belief in him over the years, and dismissed those who criticized him for shedding tears over his former coach.\n\n\u201cI guess some people don\u2019t understand caring about people that\u2019s not family, whatever the case may be, because there were a lot of negative comments out there,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI get we\u2019re doing terrible, but that\u2019s a human being, that\u2019s someone I care about, so I got emotional about it. I could care less what anybody thinks about that.\u201d\n\nThompson said Gruden\u2019s firing \u201cwasn\u2019t something that really came out of the blue,\u201d as players had a sense before the season started that the Redskins would move on from Gruden if they got off to a poor start or missed the playoffs. Washington\u2019s first five weeks couldn\u2019t have gone much worse, as the defense, the supposed strength of the team, couldn\u2019t stop anyone, and Gruden played three different quarterbacks in a futile search for a way to spark an impotent offense.\n\nRedskins offensive tackle Morgan Moses learned that Gruden had been fired when he turned on the TV on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d Moses said on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re 0-5, but I\u2019ve been with Jay all my career. I\u2019m the only one left from my draft class on the team and I have a high respect for him as a coach and as a man outside the building. You never want to see change like that, but obviously the organization wants to go in a different direction. That\u2019s something that I have no control over, but it just sucks because he is a good coach, we have some good players on the team and it just sucks that we couldn\u2019t get it done for him.\u201d\n\n[Brewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail]\n\nRedskins cornerback Quinton Dunbar reacted to the news on Instagram, expressing his thanks to Gruden for converting the former Florida wide receiver to defensive back in 2015.\n\n\u201cI owe you coach for life,\u201d Dunbar wrote. \"[S]orry we couldn\u2019t get the job done for you s--- crazy.\u201d\n\nRunning back Derrius Guice thanked Gruden for \u201cnever giving up on me and always having my back\u201d on Twitter. \u201cYou will be missed!\u201d Guice wrote. \u201cMuch love.\u201d\n\nThank you for never giving up on me and always having my back throughout the course of my injuries! You will be missed! Much love \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/h32RxWYASI \u2014 2\ufe0f\u20e39\ufe0f\u20e3 (@DhaSickest) October 7, 2019\n\nMoses suggested that the uncertainty about Gruden\u2019s job status coming into the season made things uncomfortable at Redskins Park as Washington\u2019s losses mounted.\n\n\u201cAny change is hard, but sometimes change is good,\u201d Moses said. \u201cObviously, it was swarming around every week that he was going to get fired. It was like walking in the building with eggshells on the floor. You don\u2019t want to crack the eggshell. Finally they made a decision to move on from him.\"\n\nWith Bill Callahan, the Redskins\u2019 offensive line and assistant head coach, taking over as interim head coach ahead of 0-5 Washington\u2019s game at winless Miami, Thompson said he hasn\u2019t given up on 2019.\n\n\u201cIt happened, so now we just gotta move on,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cMy focus still stays the same. I gotta do everything I can to help us win some games. I don\u2019t want to have a winless season. That would completely suck. I still want to win games. We got 11 more games. I think there\u2019s a chance that we can get in the playoffs. There\u2019s still a possibility, it\u2019s not over yet. I\u2019m not panicking, but it\u2019s obviously going to be tough for me not seeing somebody like Jay in the building.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nEven Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field\n\nRedskins fire Coach Jay Gruden after 0-5 start\n\nA visual guide to 20 seasons of Daniel Snyder\u2019s Redskins ownership\n\nFrom 2018: A once-proud franchise, the Redskins are showing signs of foundational cracks\n\nAwful on field and directionless off, Redskins need to face a harsh reality\n\nThree takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to Patriots\n\nHail or Fail: Jay Gruden\u2019s final game as Redskins Coach was another dud", "description": "Running back Chris Thompson got emotional when asked about Gruden after Sunday's loss.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
