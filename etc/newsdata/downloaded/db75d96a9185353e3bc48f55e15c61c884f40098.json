'We need a few hundred thousand,' the former New York City mayor and President Trump's personal lawyer said.\n\nPresident Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani butt-dialed an NBC News reporter earlier this month and can be heard discussing foreign business dealings and needing money\n\nNBC News' Rich Schapiro wrote a first-person article on Friday detailing the butt-dialed voicemail he received earlier this month from the president's personal lawyer\n\nThe voicemail began with Giuliani talking about someone named 'Charles.'\n\n'You know,' Giuliani told the man he was meeting with. 'Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.'\n\nSchapiro described the first minute of the voicemail as being garbled.\n\nThe sound then clears up.\n\n'Let's get back to business,' Giuliani said. 'I gotta get you to Bahrain,' he told his associate.\n\nGiuliani's December 2018 Bahrain trip was the focus of a New York Times article headlined, 'While Working for Trump, Giuliani Courts Business Abroad.'\n\nIt detailed how Giuliani was described as the leader of a 'high-level U.S. delegation' when meeting with the country's king and foreign minister when in reality he was there negotiating a security consulting contract for his personal business.\n\nAnd served as a preview of the administration's more recent Giuliani-related foreign policy freelancing woes.\n\nThe conversation continued with Giuliani saying he's 'got to call Robert again tomorrow.'\n\n'Is Robert around?' Giuliani added.\n\nHis companion noted that Robert is in Turkey.\n\nThat's when Giuliani said he needed 'some money.'\n\nThere's a pause in the conversation for nine seconds, before Trump's personal attorney said they needed a 'few hundred thousand.'\n\nSchapiro speculated that the Robert in question is Robert Magnas, a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig LLP who's a registered agent of the Turkish government.\n\nGiuliani worked at the same firm until last spring.\n\nThey worked together on the case or Reza Zarrab, a Turkish gold trader charged in the U.S. with money laundering of Iranian dollars. Giuliani traveled to Turkey and tried to strike a deal directly with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to help his client. It didn't sit well with the federal prosecutor, NBC reported.\n\nMangas didn't respond to NBC's request for comment.\n\nAt the tail end of the voicemail, Giuliani is heard responding a comment about $20,000 and about Bahrain, but much of what they said was unintelligible.\n\nSchapiro had been in contact with Giuliani earlier in the day for a story, which is likely how the butt-dial occurred.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani butt-dialed a reporter earlier this month, leaving a three-minute voicemail where he's heard discussing foreign business dealings and his need for cash.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20195766-0-image-a-13_1572033689836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
