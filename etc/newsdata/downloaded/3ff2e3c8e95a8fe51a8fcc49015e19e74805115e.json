Peers are not expected to amend the bill, paving the way for parliament to be dissolved next week.\n\nAt the launch of a new tactical voting site, former Tory rebel Dominic Grieve urged people to cast aside party loyalty to fight Brexit in the election.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is quite clear is that whilst there may be attempts of diverting attention to other issues, Brexit must be the defining issue of this election because bluntly it is likely to have a bearing on every single other topic that is going to follow.\n\n\u201cIf Boris Johnson gets a working majority, then he will doubtless take us out of the EU very quickly, provided, particularly, now that the party has been essentially purged of most of its moderate elements.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Labour are expected to stand against him, but he claimed some local Labour members would back him.\n\nFormer Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said tactical voting was \u201cnot ideal\u201d but it was a \u201cpowerful tool\u201d to fight Brexit.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are a \u2018Stop Brexit party\u2019 but we recognise that there are other parties who will be campaigning on that platform as well.\n\n\u201cThere are many individual candidates who will be campaigning on that platform \u2013 Dominic is standing as an independent and it would be mad if we didn\u2019t get behind him, we will of course 100 per cent \u2013 and that kind of thinking has to be reflected across the country.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Anna McMorrin also urged voters to consider ditching their party loyalty for \u201cthe fight of our lives\u201d \u2013 a sentiment that will likely set her at odds with Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nPollster Lewis Baston said levels of volatility over people\u2019s political allegiance were at the highest since the 1920s during the 2017 campaign, with 35 to 45 per cent of people switching from one party to another.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think in 2019, we are still in this world where there\u2019ll be massive variation between seats.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
