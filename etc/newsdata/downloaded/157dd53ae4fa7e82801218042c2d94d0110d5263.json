General Assembly gathering of world leaders.\n\nRyan said Sony\u2019s plans include outfitting the next-generation PlayStation system with a low-power, suspend-play mode. He said if 1 million players use it, they could save enough electricity to power 1,000 average U.S. homes.\n\nSome games already are set in drowning coastal cities, educate children about wildlife or otherwise address environmental issues. Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon anointed the Angry Birds character Red as an \u201chonorary ambassador for green\u201d in 2016.\n\nBut the idea of gaming green got new visibility with Monday\u2019s commitments from 21 companies, facilitated by the U.N. Environment Program and showcased against the backdrop of Monday\u2019s U.N. climate summit .\n\nWith an estimate of more than 2 billion video game players globally, \u201cthis is the most powerful mobilization channel in the world,\u201d David Paul, the Marshall Islands\u2019 environment minister, told the gaming CEOs. His low-lying Pacific island homeland faces an existential threat from rising seas as the planet warms.\n\nThe \u201cPlaying for the Planet\u201d pledges come from an industry that isn\u2019t always seen as nurturing societal good.\n\nParents and psychologists have fretted for years about games and other digital diversions sucking youths into staring at screens. The U.N.\u2019s World Health Organization this year recommended no more than an hour of screen time a day for children under 5, and none at all for those under 1.\n\nGaming company leaders say that not all screen time is of equal value. They believe their products can engage players on such serious issues as climate change.\n\n\u201cWe try to provide entertainment with substance,\u201d Clark Stacey, CEO of WildWorks, said in an interview.\n\nAmong the initiatives:\n\n\u2014WildWorks intends to incorporate new materials about habitat restoration and reforestation into its children\u2019s game Animal Jam, and to plant a tree for every new Animal Jam player.\n\n\u2014Microsoft plans to make 825,000 Xbox consoles that are carbon-neutral \u2014 or don\u2019t cause any net increases in heat-trapping carbon dioxide \u2014 and to promote real-life sustainability activities through its massive-selling game Minecraft.\n\n\u2014Angry Birds maker Rovio Entertainment is offsetting carbon emissions generated by each of its daily, active players charging one mobile device per day for a year.\n\n\u2014Game streaming giant Twitch, owned by Amazon, intends to spread sustainability messages through its platform.\n\n\u2014Google\u2019s upcoming Stadia streaming service is financing research on how people can be inspired to change their behavior through games.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re participatory. They require the player to take action. It\u2019s not just absorbing a message from the outside,\u201d said Erin Hoffman-John, Stadia\u2019s lead designer for research and development.\n\nStrange Loop Games already has ecological issues at the heart of its simulation game Eco. Players collaborate to build a civilization and confront its impacts on the environment. If they cut down too many trees, for example, they might kill off a species.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s less about telling the player about being green or avoiding climate change than letting them have that experience, letting them face that challenge themselves in a world that they care about,\u201d CEO John Krajewski said in an interview. \u201cAnd then they can bring that to the real world.\u201d", "description": "Companies like PlayStation and Xbox promised to increase their efforts to fight climate change and to get their users involved.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN696_Liv_ga_ZG_20190718152949.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
