This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nIn his attempt to recap Biden\u2019s meandering answer, Noah said that he understood what Biden meant but that it \u201ctook a while for him to get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, one minute he\u2019s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?\u201d the Comedy Central host remarked. \u201cJoe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he\u2019s giving it.\u201d\n\nAfter mocking the number of candidates on the debate stage, Noah also described the \u201cweirdest part of the night\u201d as when Kamala Harris (D-CA) \u201cstarted a real-life Twitter beef\u201d with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over Twitter\u2019s refusal to ban Trump from its platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren\u2019s point here,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe need Trump on Twitter. It\u2019s the only way we can monitor what he\u2019s up to. Otherwise, he\u2019s doing that shit in secret. You\u2019ve got to think of Twitter as a presidential baby monitor. The whole time you\u2019re looking, you\u2019re like, \u2018Hold on, he\u2019s awake and wants to nuke a hurricane, I gotta go!\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "\"Daily Show\"\u00a0host Trevor Noah ripped Joe Biden over his lackluster response to his son Hunter Biden's shading dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176119336-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
