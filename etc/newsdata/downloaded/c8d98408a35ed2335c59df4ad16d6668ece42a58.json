The utterances allegedly took place on April 11, 2017.\n\nMonyemore only charged Mootheram on June 13 that year. Monyemore was cross-examined at length by Mootheram\u2019s advocate Shane Matthews.\n\nSome of his questions focused on why Monyemore did not lay a charge against Mootheram sooner. Matthews suggested to her that she only laid the charges because Mootheram had complained to the Magistrates Commission about her and another magistrate, Ashin Singh, in May 2017.\n\nThe complaint by him included an allegation that Singh had breached security by hiring an outsider for administrative work, and she did nothing about it.\n\nThe court has heard evidence that when Mootheram found out about this \u201cbreach\u201d, he became angry and allegedly insulted Monyemore. This is what gave rise to him being charged.\n\nMonyemore denies she only charged Mootheram after he complained to the commission.\n\nAfter her testimony the presiding magistrate (Vellem) said he wanted to clarify some of her evidence.\n\nHe questioned her about whether she had in fact charged Mootheram after he complained to the commission. Monyemore replied by saying: \u201cI had the intention to charge him.\u201d\n\nShe thereafter agreed with Vellem that she did not act on her intention at the time and said it was because of all her other engagements.\n\nVellem also asked her how it came about that she obtained statements from three magistrates who say they heard Mootheram\u2019s utterances on April 11, 2017. He said he needed to know, \u201cbecause it appears to be key an issue to the defence\u201d.\n\nMonyemore explained that when she heard about Mootheram\u2019s alleged insults she had intended to send an e-mail to all the magistrates who were present in the tearoom and get information about what happened.\n\nBut then she said she was made to understand that there were some magistrates who were \u201cnot willing to come forward\u201d.\n\nMonyemore said the three magistrates who had made the statements did so \u201cout of their own accord\u201d.\n\nShe said she had not asked any magistrate to come forward because she believed whoever knew about the incident would do so.\n\nVellem asked: \u201cAt some stage you say you called them to your office in order to make a report. I want to make it clear how they made the report.\u201d\n\nMonyemore continued: \u201cI wanted to send an e-mail calling for an incident report. In the same breath I was divided.\u201d She added that the three magistrates who implicate Mootheram, and another who didn\u2019t hear the utterances were invited by her to come and see her. \u201cThey came one by one to my office,\u201d she said.\n\nMonyemore said she asked them to give her an incident report.\n\nAsked what became of Mootheram\u2019s complaint to the Magistrates Commission, Monyemore said she has been exonerated. However, because there was \u201ctension in the office\u201d people had been sent to mediate, she said.\n\nMonyemore was also asked by Vellem to explain how the words used by Mootheram demeaned her and affected her family. She said that her two sons had learnt about it and they spoke about it at home.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said my family was also affected.\u201d\n\nThe case is expected to continue on Wednesday.", "description": "Pietermaritzburg\u2019s chief magistrate has testified that she believes that her colleague Divesh Mootheram spoke about her in an insulting way despite not hearing the actual words from him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9450/2297d34b630d4ce9b186a44ecb753256.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
