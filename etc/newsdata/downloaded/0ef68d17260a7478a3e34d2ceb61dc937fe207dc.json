The building itself owes rent to the land\u2019s owner. In New York co-ops, residents\u2019 portion of that rent is folded into a monthly charge, which includes upkeep and taxes, called \u201cmaintenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time I speak to a buyer, it\u2019s \u2018oh my God, this place is so huge, I love it. But, oh my God, that maintenance,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Perez Jr., an agent at Warburg Realty. The one-bedrooms owe maintenance of about $3,000 a month; a two bedroom charges $4,611 a month. Making a land lease scarier is the fact that the lease duration is defined, leaving a question about what happens when it expires.\n\nLand leases are scattered throughout New York City as well as Palm Springs, Calif., and surrounding cities. They pop up in Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Virginia and Maryland. Land owners vary widely. Sometimes the owner is a municipality: Battery Park City, in New York City, for example, sits on land owned by an authority created by the state of New York. Not-for-profit entities, including churches, are also frequently landlords. Sometimes the landlord is a private entity, such as a group of individuals, an investment firm or a commercial real estate group.\n\nLand Lease Listings List price: $2.2 million \u2022 Monthly fees: $11,187.88 including real-estate taxes \u2022303 E. 57th Street, #35G, Manhattan \u2022 Three-bedroom, three bath co-op, 3,400 square feet \u2022 Listing agent: Elayne Reimer, Halstead Property List price: $188,500 \u2022 Monthly fees: $460 \u2022 1121 Arlington Blvd #932, Arlington, Va. \u2022 One-bedroom, one-bath co-op, 559 square feet \u2022 Listing agent: Amber Williams, Sweet Homes America List price: $1,449,000 \u2022 Monthly fees: $416 ($4,985 annually) \u2022 2720 S.

Most of the leases were written in the 1960s through the 1980s for 65-year terms, which means some are nearing termination. The Bureau has to approve renewals, which are typically for 25- to 34-year terms.\n\nProperty owners can attempt to buy the land from an owner, though this rarely happens. In 2014, the co-op owners of Trump Plaza, a building at 167 East 61st Street in Manhattan, paid $180 million for the land under their building, said Marc Cooper, co-president of the co-op board. Each of the 150 units were assessed a portion of the bill, which had to be paid all at once. For shareholders who didn\u2019t have the cash, Wells Fargo offered loans, Mr. Cooper said. About 15 co-op members who couldn\u2019t afford the large assessments on their units had to sell. The units had roughly doubled in value after the land purchase, Mr. Cooper said, allowing sellers to use their additional profits to repay their assessment costs.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you consider buying a property with a land lease? Join the conversation below.\n\nLand leases may sound strange to Americans, but they\u2019re common in Britain. Most flats in London are \u201cleaseholds,\u201d which require paying rent to the \u201cfreeholder,\u201d who owns the land. Some of the largest landowners are aristocrats whose families have been collecting rent for generations. Another big owner: Queen Elizabeth, through the Crown Estate, though she doesn\u2019t benefit personally: Revenues flow to the government.\n\nThere can be big downsides to buying in a land-lease building. The first is evident in some listings: Martin Eiden, an agent with Compass, has a $3 million three-bedroom listing on Park Avenue where monthlies are $11,516. In Palm Springs, Camron Carrier, an agent with the Paul Kaplan Group at Bennion Deville, has a $875,000, three-bedroom listing in the upscale Indian Canyons neighborhood. The land lease adds $4,985 a year, which translates to an extra $415 in monthly costs for the homeowner.\n\nReal-estate agents argue that the higher monthlies are offset by lower sales prices. Mr. Perez Jr. hands out a \u201cmath worksheet\u201d to visitors to his listings. His worksheet for the $735,000 two-bedroom calculates monthly carrying costs at $7,357.18. A similar unit in a non-land-lease building might cost $1,295,000 with maintenance of $3,110, he estimates, yielding a monthly carrying cost of $7,981.66. Mr. Eiden argues that the extra maintenance costs of his listing would be offset by gains made by investing the margin by which the list price is discounted compared with non-land-lease properties. Of course, mortgage rates, investments gains, and future resale values are highly variable, making a comparison unreliable.\n\nAnother concern: financing. Sandy Edelstein, a loan officer and Palm Springs branch manager of Homebridge Financial Services, a national lender, said loans\u2014including jumbos\u2014follow Fannie Mae guidelines, which require that mortgages are written for a term equal to the duration of the land lease, minus five years. If a lease expires in 25 years, the longest loan a borrower can get is a 20-year, \u201ccustom term\u201d mortgage.\n\nA three-bedroom condo in New York City is listed for $3 million, with monthly fees of over $11,000.

For a decade, he was unable to refinance into a new 30-year loan; he could only get a 20-year loan, then later a 15-year loan. A new board president took over and completed the process, he said, adding that he is now in contract to sell the unit.\n\nWhen the remaining term on a land lease approaches 35 years, properties can start losing value as buyers\u2019 ability to take out 30-year mortgages are curtailed. Even cash-paying buyers may stay away, worried they may be unable to sell in the future.\n\nThere is also the anxiety of a doomsday scenario, in which a landlord refuses to renew a lease. Some leases spell out that a building on leased land reverts to the landlord upon termination of the lease. All of the agents and loan officers interviewed said they have never known this to occur in a residential context. However, there are scenarios where the value of the land has appreciated so much that a landlord might be eager to strike a new deal with a developer to replace an old building.\n\nWhat To Remember About Land-Lease Properties Photo: Jon Krause Lenders write mortgages with terms up to the duration of the land lease, minus five years.\n\nNot all lenders will work on land-lease property. Seek out a local lender experienced with them.\n\nAs the land lease approaches 35 years to expiration, sales prices usually begin to decline and its gets harder for the current owner to refinance.\n\nMonthly fees that are high due to the land-lease payments may make it harder for a borrower to quality for a loan.\n\nReal-estate agents and buyers assume that is the future of River Place, in Arlington, Virginia, said Hiwa Sheikh, a buyer\u2019s agent with the Keri Shull Team at Optime Realty, who has done several deals in the 1,700-unit complex. A more hopeful theory is that the landowner will buy out the co-op\u2019s interests before the lease term is up in 2053, Mr. Sheikh said. A limited liability company managed by Monday Properties, a New York and Washington, D.C.-based real-estate investment firm, owns the 13-acres under the four River Place buildings. Lease discussions thus far have yielded no results, according to board meeting minutes.\n\nOne bedrooms sell for between $150,000 to $250,000 and rent for roughly $1,500 to $2,100, said Amber Williams, principal broker at Sweet Homes America in Tysons, Virginia, who also manages nearly 50 units in the complex. Many of Ms. Williams\u2019 buyers, and most of Mr. Sheikh\u2019s, are cash investors who rent out the units, the agents said.\n\nMonday Properties emailed a statement saying: \u201cThere are 34 years remaining under the land lease and we look forward to building upon our partnership with River Place to the benefit of everyone involved.\u201d River Place South\u2019s vice president of the board of directors, Waqas Ali, said the board had no comment.", "description": "What to consider when purchasing property with a land lease, which can affect everything from monthly payments to mortgage terms.", "authors": ["Katy Mclaughlin", "Katy.Mclaughlin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EW809_0905le_SOC_20190904142826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
