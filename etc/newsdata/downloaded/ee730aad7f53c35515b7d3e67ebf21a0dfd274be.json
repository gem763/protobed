Only an independent central bank can give money the institutional backing needed to make it reliable and able to win public trust, he said.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that the people of Europe will not be tempted to leave behind the safety and soundness of established payment solutions and channels in favor of the beguiling but treacherous promises of Facebook\u2019s siren call,\u201d the ECB Executive Board member said.\n\nEuro-zone policy makers sounded the alarm over Libra ever since Facebook (NASDAQ: ) unveiled its plans in June. French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has warned that it raises serious questions about money-laundering and data protection, while Mersch\u2019s Executive Board colleague Benoit Coeure, who chairs an international working group on Libra, said a prolonged discussion among regulators may be needed before it can launch.\n\nEuropean Union antitrust authorities are also conducting an early-stage probe examining how Libra will be run and how the new payment system will work.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney recently laid out a radical proposal for an overhaul of the global financial system that would eventually replace the dollar as a reserve currency with a Libra-like one, stealing the march on digital currencies.\n\n\u201cThe stance of central banks toward modern forms of money is bound to evolve with time,\u201d Mersch said. \u201cCentral bankers have embraced technological developments in the field of money and will continue to explore helpful new innovations.\u201d", "description": "ECB\u2019s Mersch Says Siren of Libra Is Beguiling But Treacherous", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic957c6dbbaa6ad18577d9ff9ff80a1684.jpg"}
