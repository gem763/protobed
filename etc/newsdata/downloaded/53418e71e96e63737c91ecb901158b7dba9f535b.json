But, being a bowler, I\u2019m going to think selfishly here and go for who I don\u2019t want to bowl at\u2026\n\n\u2018One of the really big, destructive hitters, Andre Russell, springs to mind. David Warner at the top of the order, too \u2013 those are the kind of guys who can really hurt bowlers in this format.\u2019\n\nThe new 100-balls-a-side competition will run from July 17 to August 16 next summer, and be contested between eight city-based franchise teams.\n\nWoakes added to Sky Sports: \u2018I\u2019m really excited to be part of the competition, and feeling really fortunate to be part of it, too.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m particularly looking forward to the draft. I\u2019ve seen bits of the NFL Draft before, so I\u2019m intrigued to see how this one pans out and how teams go about their business.\n\nWarner enjoyed a superb World Cup last summer (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Who gets picked up? Maybe a couple of big names will miss out, so I\u2019m sure there will be a few nervous players come the day itself.\n\n\u2018In my opinion, there is no better place to play cricket than Edgbaston when it is full and bouncing, the Hollies Stand in full voice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really fortunate to have played a lot of cricket there. I\u2019m sure we will get good crowds in there again, they\u2019ll get behind the team and it will be a great place to play.\u2019\n\nWest Indies hero Russell is one of the biggest stars in the sport (Picture: Getty)\n\nAsked whether the Hundred can be a global success in years to come, Woakes responded: \u2018Of course, there will always be the odd sceptic, which I suppose is understandable.\n\n\u2018At the same time, I\u2019ve got no doubt that this tournament will thrive. Give it a chance.\n\n\u2018When you have the world\u2019s best playing each other, in any format, it\u2019s going to make for some amazing cricket. I just can\u2019t wait for it to get started.\u2019", "description": "England all-rounder Chris Woakes has expressed his desire to play alongside Australia star David Warner and West Indies hero Andre Russell in the Hundred.
