One person whose May 2017 complaint was listed on the website 'whocallsme.com' said: 'My mother received a call from \"Jeremy\" at TV Spark, he tried to sell her insurance on her TV without even knowing if she owned one'.\n\nAnother said: '(They) Tried to get my 78 year old housebound father to buy something for his TV by asking him to get his carers to give them his bank card details. Fortunately he knows not to do this.'\n\nOn a separate website, 192.com, one complaint at the end of September 2019 said the company sold her 80-year-old mother, who had dementia, two policies for the same TV.\n\nWebsite 192.com also lists complaints since the firm changed its address at the end of May\n\nIn an article published in April 2016 warning consumers of the dangers of cold callers like this, the FCA said: 'We have also found that some companies have been contacting people to sell, promote or advise on insurance without our authorisation.\n\n'This is important because if you deal with an unauthorised firm you will not have the right to make a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service or have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong, such as where insurance is not arranged as you expected or the insurer goes bust.'\n\nThe FCA warned consumers in 2016 about unregulated companies trying to sell insurance in the form of warranty cover for TV or electrical appliances\n\nWarranty cover schemes for TVs and other appliances are actually insurance contracts, the providing of which is a regulated activity.\n\nThe FCA's article added: 'We strongly advise you to only deal with financial services firms that are authorised by us, and check the Register to ensure they are.\n\n'To verify the identity of an authorised firm ask for their \"firm reference number\" and contact details, but always call them back on the switchboard number given on our Register.'\n\nHowever, despite our reader telling us they had reported the firm to the FCA on August 19 this year, it does not appear to have taken any further action to warn potentially vulnerable consumers.\n\nWhile the company is now registered in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, prior to the end of May this year the company's registered office address was an address in Finchley, London, notorious as the front address for thousands of companies.\n\nThe address; 2 Woodberry Grove, even appeared in the 31-page indictment of Donald Trump\u2019s former presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nThis is because it is home to companies like Formations Direct Ltd, and before that A1 Company Services Ltd, which allow people to register their own companies at the address in return for the fee.\n\nA1 Company Services was dissolved on 17 January, 2017, six days after a HuffPost UK report into how the address was used by the company connected to Manafort, along with around 3,250 other companies, as well as how an 88-year-old named Barbara Kahan volunteered to found more than 21,000 companies.\n\nA1's compliance officer Anthony Beukes told HuffPost: 'We are a company formation agent.\n\n'We assist our clients in the UK company registration process and also provide company secretarial and address services, if required', and there is no suggestion either it or Formation Direct have any connection to the work of any companies incorporated at the address.\n\nAccording to its latest micro accounts in the year to 31 October 2018, TV Spark had capital reserves of \u00a35,025.\n\nThis is Money asked the FCA why it had not appeared to act on our reader's complaint, but it said it could not comment on individual firms.", "description": "This is Money is today urging readers to be wary of a West Sussex-based company accused of cold calling elderly people to sell them warranty schemes for TVs and electrical appliances.", "authors": ["This Is Money Reporter", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
