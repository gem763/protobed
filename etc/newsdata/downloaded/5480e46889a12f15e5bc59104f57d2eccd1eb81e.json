A penalty against the run of play gave them the lead in that game, just like against Leicester when they went on to see out a 1-0 fairly comfortably. United would likely have pulled off the same trick against Arsenal were it not for a mis-placed square pass by Axel Tuanzebe.\n\nHarry Maguire is comfortable sitting deep and heading crosses away, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka is almost never dribbled past. David De Gea (ruled out through injury) likes to stay on his line and back his agility to make saves. You could do far worse if you were constructing a unit to 'park the bus'. United's Expected Goals against number is the lowest in the Premier League after eight games.\n\nScoring the first goal is a big if because of their struggles to create chances, but it only takes a penalty, set-piece or individual mistake and Liverpool could find themselves in an arm wrestle.\n\nLiverpool not-so fluent away from home\n\nThe 97-point runners up and Champions League holders are a devastating force in attacking transitions, so their lack of victories in the 'big away games' is somewhat surprising.\n\nAlthough Jurgen Klopp's team beat Tottenham at Wembley early last season, they drew at Chelsea, Arsenal and United - three teams they finished at least 25 points clear of. They also lost Champions League trips to Red Star Belgrade, Napoli, Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona (and recently lost in Naples again).\n\nIn 2017-18, Liverpool lost four and drew one of their away games at fellow 'Big Six' clubs. Klopp is yet to win a league game at Old Trafford in three visits. It is splitting hairs, but one would expect a team with Liverpool's counter-attacking potential to have notched up a few more away wins in these fixtures.\n\nA possible explanation is that since the start of last season, Klopp has developed Liverpool into a more consistent and controlled team - capable of slowing the game with possession and soaking up pressure when they need to. It is an evolution that might well lead them to a first league title since 1990, but in one-off games perhaps makes Liverpool less lethal.", "description": "Ducking stools and the pillory are now mercifully consigned to crime and punishment museums, but the thirst for public humiliation and retribution they once sated continues in more trivial forms.", "authors": ["Daniel Zeqiri", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000189519600-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVKOd1ILXaurCHi1o16wQuSEzDisIbeHQpjzbGaWxjpc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
