Mike\u2019s Candyshop generally operated seven days per week, from approximately 6:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., with the exception of major holidays such as Thanksgiving, New Year\u2019s Eve, and Labor Day.\n\nIsaac Brekken/Getty Images for Variety\n\n\"This illicit enterprise allegedly allowed people to order heroin and cocaine to their doorstep simply by calling the business phone number with the same convenience as if they were ordering a pizza,\" said Peter Fitzhugh, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York.\n\nChristian Baez, 33, Luis Meson, 31, Gregoris Martinez, 34, Kevin Grullon, 25, and Joiffrey Urena, 27 of New York and Ariel Tavarez, 38, of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, are each charged with one count of conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nAll six of them will appear before a judge in Manhattan federal court later on Wednesday.\n\n\"The NYPD\u2019s efforts to rid New York City streets of drug traffickers are greatly strengthened by our close partnerships with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration,\" NYPD Commissioner James P. O'Neill said in a statement. \"Anyone who deals in illegal narcotics must understand that the nation\u2019s best investigators will stop at nothing to fight crime and keep safe all the people we serve.\"\n\nKroll, who was a tech industry guru, rose to prominence after founding the app Vine in 2012.\n\nMore recently, he was known for being the co-founder and an executive for the HQ Trivia app, which he co-created in 2017.", "description": "Six alleged members of a drug delivery service were arrested by police and federal agents and charged with distributing drugs, including a dose that killed Colin Kroll.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/colin-kroll-gty-jef-181218_hpMain_1_16x9_992.jpg"}
