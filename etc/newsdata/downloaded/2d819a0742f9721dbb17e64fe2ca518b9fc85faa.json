They ran for their lives along with teachers and students at the adjacent Unosumai Elementary School.\n\nAll of the students at the school that day survived, but the tragedy killed just over 1,000 in Kamaishi, a small fishing town. All told, more than 22,000 people died, or are presumed dead, in the quake and tsunami that devastated the entire northeastern region on March 11, 2011.\n\n\u201cIf nobody died, it would be easy to explain about the history,\u201d Kikuchi said, tears in both eyes as she spoke through an interpreter at her workplace on Tuesday. \u201cBut many died and I survived by running faster than those who did not run, or did not know how to escape. It is really hard to explain emotionally.\u201d\n\nKikuchi said she was numb after the tragedy, \u201cbecause so many people were dead in the whole town.\u201d\n\nShe recalled trips to where the schools once stood, and showed a photo of a car jammed into third-floor window of a school building - embedded there by 10-meter-high (35-feet) waves.\n\nThe maximum wave height in parts of Kamaishi was recorded at 33 meters, or just over 100 feet.\n\n\u201cIt was like a junkyard,\u201d Kikuchi said.\n\nNo more.\n\nThe schools have been rebuilt on a nearby hillside - high enough to avoid another disaster - and the \u201cjunkyard\u201d is now the site of a new rugby stadium, built largely with national government funding. It\u2019s the venue for Wednesday\u2019s Rugby World Cup match between Fiji and Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe boys know that happened here,\u201d Fiji captain Dominiko Waqaniburotu said Tuesday. \u201cWe are quite honored to be part of the game here tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSome mayors in the region have complained openly about not getting enough funding to rehouse thousands who still remain displaced in the region. They have also been critical of funding sports projects, including Tokyo\u2019s Olympics next year.\n\nFiji coach John McKee said he has been coming to the area for several years and has made sure his players take part in a few community events. The town has long been a hotbed of Japanese rugby and was the home of the Nippon Steel Kamaishi club, which has since been disbanded. That club has been reborn in recent years as the Kamaishi Seawaves.\n\n\u201cIn our busy schedule it\u2019s hard to fit in, but we make time to do that,\u201d McKee said.\n\nKikuchi, the tour guide, said part of her job was preparing others for another disaster - knowing what to do and how to survive.\n\nShe also shows guests around the displays that explain what happened that day when the earthquake struck at 2:46 p.m.\n\nDirectly behind the memorial hall is a black wall with the names of victims of the tragedy listed on silver metal plates, all located just a 10-minute walk from the new stadium.\n\n\u201cSome people say they don\u2019t remember it and don\u2019t talk about what happened,\u201d Kikuchi said. \u201cIf people experience a really hard time, people have a tendency to want to forget it.\u201d\n\nShe said she remembers. It was the end of the school day, and she was outside the school building clinging to a phone booth as the earthquake moved the earth side to side for about three minutes.\n\n\u201cIt was a Friday and two days before graduation, so the older students didn\u2019t have much to do,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI remember seeing people on the second floor opening the windows to escape.\u201d\n\nKikuchi said there were 78 students in the graduating class. Only about 60 made it to a graduation a few weeks later at another school. Several couldn\u2019t get there because of logistics, and at least one student who had stayed home from school that day, died in the tragedy.\n\n\u201cIt was more of a farewell - or a funeral - than a graduation,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nodoka Kikuchi's job as a tour guide at the Tsunami Memorial Hall is to detail the earthquake and deadly tsunami that hit this part of Japan's northeast coast almost nine years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
