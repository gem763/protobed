This so-called movement is so irrelevant that I don\u2019t know why anybody, including me, writes about it\u2014and yet my curmudgeonly instincts compel me to do so.\n\nDon\u2019t characterize me as a movement hater. To each his own. But consider a recent story in MarketWatch about a couple\u2014he\u2019s age 44, she\u2019s 33, plus they have a small child\u2014who plan to retire next year. My reaction: Simply being frugal for the next 45 years isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s a lot more you need to think about. For instance, if you\u2019re truly retired, what are you going to do, sit on a beach for eight hours a day?\n\nI\u2019m all for frugality. But then I read about FIRE devotees giving up luxury items and it all seems a bit pompous to me. Let me get this straight: You give up stuff to live on a tiny percentage of what you make\u2014but that tiny percentage turns out to be pretty close to what the average American earns in total.\n\nRead: Early retirement sounds amazing, but it can take a toll on your mental health\n\nThen there\u2019s the family thing. Are you thinking what I\u2019m thinking? Those FIRE folks aren\u2019t couples with three kids to schlep from soccer to dance class. Often, they aren\u2019t funding 529 plans, because there are no children or they\u2019re planning to make the kids take out loans.\n\nRead: How to raise frugal kids as you save for early retirement\n\nI love the simplicity of FIRE thinking: Save 40% to 70% of your income for several years. The goal: Accumulate enough funds so that 4% of your nest egg equals what you spend each year. Bingo, you\u2019re set for life. That 4% rule is supposed to keep 65-year-olds from running out of money during a 25- or 30-year retirement. But is it enough to keep up with the vicissitudes of life from age 40 onward? In addition, aren\u2019t these dropouts effectively giving up much of their Social Security safety net, even if they do collect some modest benefit based on their relatively short earnings history?\n\nHey FIRE folks, have you been listening? There\u2019s talk about a wealth tax, free tuition, baby bonds, free child care and more. We have lots of government debt, that debt is growing rapidly and we still need to fix Social Security. Can you say, \u201chigher taxes\u201d? I\u2019m thinking that might affect your plan to live off your nest egg for 40 or 50 years.\n\nRead: 10 things holding you back from financial independence\n\nIf you\u2019re living on $40,000 in 2019, do you still want to live on the same inflation-adjusted amount when you\u2019re 70? Is the goal to be mega-frugal forever? I don\u2019t get it.\n\nThe FI part of FIRE is just fine. Who can argue against financial independence? Go for it. But dropping out\u2014the RE, or retire early, part\u2014to pursue a dream of leisure, travel and a stress-free life strikes me as childish. But in many cases, it seems retiring doesn\u2019t really mean stopping work. It just means doing something that doesn\u2019t sound like work. Writing a blog, perhaps?\n\nOver half a million Social Security recipients live outside the U.S. Some of the FIRE folks look abroad for the good life, mostly seeking a lower cost of living. If you want to live outside the U.S. because that\u2019s your dream, great. If you must live in a place because your budget dictates it, maybe not so much.\n\nRichard Quinn blogs at QuinnsCommentary.com. Before retiring in 2010, he was a compensation and benefits executive.
