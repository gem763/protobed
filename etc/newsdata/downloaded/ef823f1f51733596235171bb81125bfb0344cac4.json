She announced policies aimed at the 20% of Hong Kongers who live below the poverty line, from more compulsory land purchases for housing to cash for students to increased subsidies for low-income families.\n\n\u201cThe violent incidents in the past few months have seriously damaged Hong Kong\u2019s international image and undermined its attractiveness to overseas investors,\u201d Lam said. Still, she sounded a hopeful note, saying \u201cI firmly believe that Hong Kong will be able to ride out this storm and move on.\u201d\n\nHer administration has struggled for months to resolve escalating protests sparked by a since-withdrawn bill allowing extraditions to China that have expanded into broader demands for greater democracy. The violence intensified in October after Lam invoked a rarely used emergency law to ban protesters from wearing masks, with protesters disrupting the subway system that serves as the economic backbone of the city.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund this week slashed its forecasts for Hong Kong\u2019s economic growth, now estimating expansion of just 0.3% in 2019, down from the 2.7% forecast in April. The economy contracted in the second quarter, and figures due for publication on Oct. 31 will almost certainly show gross domestic product shrinking in the third quarter.\n\nAs Lam entered the legislature to give her speech, opposition lawmakers began shouting slogans and projected \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d onto the podium. The sessions was quickly canceled, and Lam faced calls to step down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an historic moment for Hong Kong,\u201d Claudia Mo, a lawmaker in the pro-democracy camp, told reporters outside the legislature. \u201cShe\u2019s so terrified that she needs to hide away behind a camera.\u201d\n\nWhen Lam finally spoke, she addressed the unrest early on, noting that many people were wondering if Hong Kong is \u201cstill a place we can live in peace.\u201d She pledged to uphold the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that guides its autonomy from the mainland while saying independence advocates wouldn\u2019t be tolerated.\n\n\u201cI believe our society will agree that continued violence and spread of hatred would erode the core values of Hong Kong, disrupt social peace and undermine the excellent systems that took years of efforts to build,\u201d Lam said in her address. \u201cI therefore appeal to every Hong Kong citizen to cherish the city in which we all have a share and to safeguard the core values we uphold so that Hong Kong can return to calmness.\u201d\n\nShe followed that with a slew of measures aimed at poorer citizens. Highlights of the speech included:\n\nReducing waiting times for public housing accessMaking easier for first-time buyers to get mortgages on propertiesIncreasing land supply through compulsory purchases and land reclamationA 2,500 HKD ($320) annual grant for studentsMore subsidies for public transportation, lowering tollsPrivate treatment for construction workers injured at workEasier access for companies to the mainland market\n\n\u201cHousing is the toughest livelihood issue facing Hong Kong society,\u201d Lam said. \u201cIt is also a source of public grievances. I have never taken this matter lightly.\u201d\n\nThe announcements came on top of a $2.4 billion stimulus package announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in August to help bolster the economy. He also called on property owners and developers to offer rent relief to struggling retailers, noting that about 100 restaurants have shut down because of the unrest, affecting about 2,000 employees.\n\nStill, Lam\u2019s bigger problem is her own legitimacy among protesters who view her as a stooge of the government in Beijing. Instead of economic issues they are demanding an investigation into incidents of police brutality and calling for the ability to pick a leader who will stand up to Beijing -- areas where Lam had no new proposals on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen this government has lost all merit and all legitimacy, there\u2019s no way Carrie Lam can govern Hong Kong any more,\u201d said pro-democracy lawmaker Alvin Yeung. \u201cThis is the end of it.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eric Lam in Hong Kong at elam87@bloomberg.net;Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Ten Kate at dtenkate@bloomberg.net;Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam warned of an \u201cunprecedented challenge\u201d to the economy while unveiling measures to bolster growth, her latest attempt to stem months of increasingly violent protests.In an annual policy speech on Wednesday delivered via video after pro-democracy lawmakers", "authors": ["Eric Lam", "Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oruIDzn2sZ__jTybJGKQdA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/5ffdc9fd194d34b1ae5883bb8b735674", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
