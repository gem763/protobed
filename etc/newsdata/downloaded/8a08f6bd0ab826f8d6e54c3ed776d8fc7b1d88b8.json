The brief moment reinforced the extent to which water problems are not given debate treatment, even as it yielded a widely-applauded line from author Marianne Williamson.\n\nAsked about the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Williamson called the issue \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d Around 100,000 people were impacted when the Michigan city\u2019s water source changed five years ago, allowing lead to enter drinking water. Multiple deaths and severe health impacts are linked to the crisis; even today residents say they are afraid to drink the water.\n\nWilliamson then went beyond lead issues, speaking to wider systemic trends across the country.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has touted water, not climate change, as the nation\u2019s top environmental problem, Williamson pointed to deregulatory plans by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that environmentalists and scientists have slammed as dangerous for people and the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act,\u201d she said, drawing attention to the law that regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters, like lakes and streams.\n\nWilliamson went on to highlight the communities so often impacted by water crises. \u201cWe have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice,\u201d she said.\n\nFlint is a majority-black city where more than 40% of residents live below the poverty line. Drawing a poignant comparison, Williamson noted that she once lived in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, an affluent coastal city. \u201cWhat happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe,\u201d she asserted, arguing that those impacted by such issues are \u201cparticularly people of color \u2014 it\u2019s particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.\u201d\n\nThose comments yielded thunderous applause and came after Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) touted her $1 trillion infrastructure plan as a means of preventing further issues like what happened in Flint. But the brief exchange marked the only real discussion of water issues during the two and a half hour debate, sparking criticism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTonight\u2019s debate is an hour from my hometown of Flint. It\u2019s very disappointing that there hasn\u2019t been a single question yet about ensuring clean water for all Americans,\u201d wrote Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) on Twitter just prior to Williamson\u2019s comments.\n\nLeading up to the debates, some candidates have emphasized environmental justice issues. Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to address the environmental struggles facing vulnerable communities. That same day, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rolled out a joint climate justice plan with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nClimate advocates and organizations have sought to highlight the lack of attention moderators and candidates have historically paid to global warming during presidential debates. The first two Democratic debates in June devoted only 15 minutes cumulatively to the issue.\n\nOutcry from groups like the youth-led Sunrise Movements and candidates like Inslee, the only candidate to build his campaign around climate change, have also helped pave the way for not one but two climate forums to be held by major networks in September.\n\nBut the lack of attention given to other environmental issues, like water, was notable, especially given the debate setting.\n\nDetroit itself has struggled with water issues for years, resulting in semi-frequent shutoffs. A May analysis by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Northeastern University also found that Michigan is the state whose water is most impacted by \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2014 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxins found in everyday items like nonstick pans which can increase the risk of cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, other parts of the country are reeling from their own water crises. Studies show that agricultural runoff is contaminating private wells in states like Iowa. And in Denmark, South Carolina, residents are battling with the government to test the town\u2019s wells after months of brown, foul-smelling water running from their taps.\n\nAs Williamson noted, statistics show that those impacted by water issues are disproportionately people of color and low-income. And lawmakers have at times elevated these problems during campaign cycles, as was the case with Flint during the 2016 election.\n\nBut even as water crises mount throughout the country, the topic has received little attention on the campaign trail, with a few exceptions \u2014 former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro visited Flint in June, the first 2020 Democratic contender to do so.\n\nAt least one environmental issue saw more time on Tuesday night. Several candidates emphasized the importance of addressing climate change and some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), laid out policy details for how to tackle the problem.\n\nContenders also had the chance to dive into their stances on the Green New Deal, a plan to radically decarbonize the U.S. economy. Progressives have largely embraced the proposal but moderates like former Gov. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) repeatedly panned it as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Overall, there were 12 minutes devoted to climate issues on Tuesday \u2014 more than ever before for a single debate.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1165229792.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
