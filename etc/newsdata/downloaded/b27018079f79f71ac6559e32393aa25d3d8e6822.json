Some of the ads will show up on channels run by Microsoft itself \u2014 but other partnered channels, like Ninja\u2019s, will now see ads appear in front of their content that don\u2019t support them financially.\n\nMixer announced the move last Friday on its \u201cLevel Up Cast,\u201d a weekly show about what\u2019s happening on the platform. Ads were always part of the plan, said Mixer community manager Andy Salisbury and guest host Ethan Rothamel. People who have Mixer\u2019s premium monthly subscription offering Pro won\u2019t see the ads, they said, and neither will people who have subscribed to a partnered channel.\n\nI get it: ads are not the most fun thing in the world to deal with\n\nFor now, only Mixer is making ad revenue \u2014 at least according to Rothamel \u2014 although he did take pains to say that ads are ultimately meant to support creators, too. (It seems that the company is still figuring out how to integrate earned ad revenue with its partnered accounts.) \u201cI get it: ads are not the most fun thing in the world to deal with, but it\u2019s super important to remember what you\u2019re doing on the site,\u201d said Rothamel. \u201cThe site is free, you\u2019re watching content for free, and you\u2019re supporting partners.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson provided a statement: \u201cWe are always testing and exploring new features and monetization options for Mixer creators, but have nothing more to share at this time.\u201d Microsoft wouldn\u2019t confirm whether its creators will receive any revenue from the ads it runs on their channels. Later, a spokesperson for company clarified that they planned to introduce a formal revenue share with Mixer creators when the program is rolled out more broadly. \u201cFor now, the revenue we are receiving during our pilot advertising test is funding other programs that benefit creators directly,\u201d writes a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nTwitch, Mixer\u2019s bigger competitor, also has ads that support the company and its partners, but there\u2019s a disclosure on each ad that says exactly where any revenue is going. If Mixer chooses to do the same, they\u2019ll become even more similar to their larger competitor \u2014 which is not itself a bad thing. If both platforms explain where the money goes, it will create and reinforce a set of payment norms in live-streaming; which is important, because companies and the streamers they host are still working out the boundaries of what\u2019s acceptable to broadcast.\n\nUpdate September 18th, 11:45AM ET: Added a new comment from a Microsoft spokesperson.", "description": "Mixer, Microsoft\u2019s answer to Twitch, has just rolled out its first ads.
