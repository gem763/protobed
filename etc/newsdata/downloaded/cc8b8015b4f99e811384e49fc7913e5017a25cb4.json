He also has eight years of Premier League experience in the bag.\n\nAbraham, on the other hand, is a Premier League newbie, and has been a shining star in Frank Lampard\u2019s young Chelsea side.\n\nWith a record of eight goals in as many games for Abraham, the young Englishman is looking very confident and has taken to life at Stamford Bridge like a duck to water.\n\nHis inexperience may be a concern going forward for the striker, and for Chelsea in general.\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\nHowever if the youngster can remain consistent and continue his lethal run of form over the course of the season, he will definitely be one to look out for.\n\nOn Abraham\u2019s tail is Arsenal star Aubameyang, on seven goals in eight games. He has maintained a 65 per cent shot accuracy.\n\nThe only concern being that he has played over 150 more minutes than Abraham and Aguero, and with Arsenal\u2019s inconsistency the Gabon international may struggle for service as the season goes on.\n\nHowever, he is one of last season\u2019s golden boot winners and will no doubt be Arsenal\u2019s main source of goals this season.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThe top 10 Premier goalscorers\n\nSergio Aguero - 8 Goals\n\nTammy Abraham - 8 Goals\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang - 7 Goals\n\nTeemu Pukki - 6 Goals\n\nRaheem Sterling - 6 Goals\n\nSadio Mane - 5 Goals\n\nHarry Kane - 5 Goals\n\nJamie Vardy - 5 Goals\n\nCallum Wilson - 5 Goals\n\nMohamed Salah - 4 Goals", "description": "As it stands, the top spot is shared by Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero and Chelsea youngster Tammy Abraham", "authors": ["Harry Dodds", "Image", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Chelsea Fc Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543916.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
