Everyone\u2019s first pick? Fellow Scouse Jodie Comer, obviously.\n\nEarlier today, Wayne Rooney\u2019s wife accused Rebekah of leaking personal stories from Coleen\u2019s Instagram account to the press, which the I\u2019m A Celebrity star has vehemently denied.\n\nRegardless, tea has been spilled, popcorn is being devoured at a record rate and Netflix have teased they\u2019re already planning the true crime expose of the millennium.\n\nSurely a Ryan Murphy drama is looming and there\u2019s really only one woman who could possibly nail the complex re-telling of this cut-throat game of cat and mouse, and that women is Jodie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least according to fans, who have beckoned on the Liverpudlian to land what will no doubt guarantee another BAFTA, Emmy and inevitable knighthood.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t wait for the Jack Reacher/Coleen Rooney spin-off franchise, with @jodiecomer as Coleen and Scarlett Johansson as Reacher because she can play anything. #ColeenRooney,\u2019 crired one superfan of the war of the WAGS, which was immediately followed by: \u2018Can the next series of Feud be about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy and have Coleen played by Jodie Comer?\u2019\n\nCan the next series of Feud be about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy and have Coleen played by Jodie Comer? \u2014 Levi (@scally_cinnamon) October 9, 2019\n\nI can\u2019t wait for the Jack Reacher/Coleen Rooney spin-off franchise, with @jodiecomer as Coleen and Scarlett Johansson as Reacher because she can play anything. #ColeenRooney https://t.co/ITv5pjEd5z \u2014 Rachel Parris (@rachelparris) October 9, 2019\n\nJust seen a tweet stating that Jodie Comer should play Coleen Rooney in the Netflix series about today's breaking news & I'm sorry but I'm here for it. pic.twitter.com/iCq3i0e3OA \u2014 Kelly Welles (@kelly_welles) October 9, 2019\n\nAt the time of writing, hundreds of requests are coming in thick and fast and now, Jodie, we\u2019re looking at you.\n\nMake it happen.\n\nColeen broke the internet this morning when she released a statement on her Instagram, which read: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nColeen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy have broken the internet (Picture: ITV/Backgrid)\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nThe mum-of-four continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nColeen captioned the statement: \u2018This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it\u2026\u2026\u2019\n\nRebekah fired back in her own statement, writing: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\nWAGs Coleen and Rebekah crossed paths at football matches when their husbands were playing (Picture: Mark Large/Daily Mail/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality star continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019 She concluded her post with a broken heart emoji.\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
