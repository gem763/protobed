Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBen: Facebook is receiving a lot of incoming fire for basically giving up on fact-checking its political ads. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s stance, which he articulated rather poorly during congressional hearings yesterday, is that it is not his platform\u2019s place to be the arbiter of truth and that users can sift through misleading or outright false claims and make up their minds themselves. The site does have some rules about extreme speech, but simply telling a lie doesn\u2019t usually break them. Does Zuckerberg deserve all the flak he\u2019s getting on this, or are the ill feelings many people have about him and his company causing a bit of an overreaction?\n\nBrian: In this particular case, he absolutely deserves the flak. His argument is basically that a powerful distribution channel like Facebook shouldn\u2019t police politicians, which I think is a good stance. but lies are \u2026 lies? Like, I don\u2019t know how else to put it. Politicians should not be allowed to spread lies uninhibited.\n\nMax: I think Zuckerberg deserves the flak, yeah. I\u2019m not positive that lies in political ads on Facebook will amount to much in terms of, say, changed votes or minds. But on the other hand, it\u2019s kind of ridiculous that Zuckerberg is even picking this fight. If he doesn\u2019t want to be the arbiter of political statements on his platform \u2014 which I think is a cowardly stance, but whatever \u2014 why not just refuse to take political ads at all? They can\u2019t make up more than a fraction of a fraction of Facebook\u2019s total revenue.\n\nBrian: Right. My guess is that he has seen how Facebook advertising has benefited small businesses and applied that to politics. He thinks letting people pay him money for ads is giving people a voice, and because he\u2019s completely decimated any organic reach on Facebook, that\u2019s effectively true.\n\nBen: Why he doesn\u2019t just issue a blanket ban on political ads is a good question. Perhaps he thinks doing so would make the platform much less relevant?\n\nBrian: Maybe. If organic reach is close to zero, and the only way to reach followers/constituents is through payment, then offering that system is, in some twisted sense, a social good.\n\nMax: I think Brian is right that at least part of it is a genuine belief that continuing to allow political ads on Facebook is helping new/local candidates get a voice.\n\nThis is going to sound sort of conspiracy-minded, but I think another part of it is that Facebook is institutionally signaling to Republicans that it\u2019s the platform of \u201cfree speech,\u201d i.e., of misleading and offensive speech, i.e., Republican speech. (Signaling to them because it is very nervous about a Justice Department antitrust investigation.)\n\nBen: Putting aside why Zuckerberg allows this in the first place, don\u2019t you find it a bit odd to hold Facebook to a different standard than television or radio or anywhere else people used to see the bulk of political ads? I recall Mitt Romney running a TV spot that was straight-up false about Obama in 2012, and there\u2019s obviously a long, long tradition of that sort of thing. It\u2019s true that some stations rejected a particularly egregious Trump commercial recently, but that\u2019s definitely an exception to the rule of basically allowing candidates to make whatever claims they want. I too don\u2019t want lies showing up in the ads I see, but shouldn\u2019t this be an across-the-board thing if we\u2019re going in that direction?\n\nBrian: I think it\u2019s fine to hold Facebook to a different standard, because it is a different standard. I don\u2019t think Zuckerberg has considered persistence as a part of this.\n\nOn TV, an ad runs once, and then it doesn\u2019t have to run ever again. Same with newspapers and radio. On Facebook, ads stay live forever and can be reshared and passed around and don\u2019t really ever expire, in a certain sense.\n\nBen: So it\u2019s the medium that makes this uniquely dangerous?\n\nBrian: Maybe not dangerous, but I think it\u2019s an aspect that separates it from other older forms of advertising. It\u2019s also kind of why \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d exemptions are bad.\n\nMax: As Feldman is saying, different mediums deserve different regulatory apparatuses. But I\u2019d also say that if Facebook was constrained by the same level of regulation that broadcast or even cable television is, I think this conversation would be somewhat different. In some sense it\u2019s okay to hold Facebook to a different standard because it\u2019s already being held to a different standard under the law.\n\nBen: Can you elaborate?\n\nMax: I mean, I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t speak with a huge amount of specificity, but just on a basic level, TV (and radio) stations are licensed. They\u2019re held responsible by the FCC for their programming. It\u2019s established under law that they have certain obligations and restrictions. Facebook doesn\u2019t have any of that.\n\nBen: Do you think this kind of thing lends credence to Elizabeth Warren (and others\u2019) idea that the company should be broken up?\n\nMax: The political-ads stuff? IDK. I think it\u2019s a case that Facebook requires regulatory attention of some kind. I mean, sure, break it up! But I also don\u2019t think this particular problem is going to change anyone\u2019s mind one way or the other.\n\nBrian: I mean, at the very least, a breakup/more competition would allow for the existence of a competing platform with stricter rules, which might shake things up.\n\nBen: Do you think if Facebook just said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to judge these ads in-house, and if they don\u2019t pass a test we come up with, we\u2019re not going to display them,\u201d the backlash would be too terrible? Is the company just afraid of conservatives calling it biased again?\n\nMax: I think the backlash would be very bad, yes. From conservatives, yes, but also \u2026 I think I would agree with them! I mean, depending on the specifics \u2014 if the test and its results were public, open, and transparent, I think that would be the best possible option. But since when has Facebook ever been open or transparent \u2026\n\nBen: Right. A lot of this is just about the reservoir of bad will the company has built up over so many years.\n\nBrian: Facebook is also too big to be able to commit to any policy without risking blowback. But they\u2019re so risk averse that I don\u2019t think a backbone will ever appear. The strategy just seems to be to ride out this low hum of frustration \u2026 forever?\n\nBen: It\u2019s not very enjoyable for the rest of us.\n\nBrian: But this example is particularly egregious. Letting politicians spread provably false information is a wild hand\u2019s-off policy.\n\nBen: There\u2019s a lot of panic about Facebook having a unique power to tilt the electorate one way or another in our democracy \u2014 just witness the New York Times\u2019 (rather breathless) report last weekend on the Trump campaign\u2019s domination of the platform. This is all understandable, after what happened in 2016 and, in a much more extreme fashion, in Myanmar and other places. But the progressive stance now seems to view the entire enterprise as a kind of black hole of civic disorder. Do you feel the current backlash is commensurate to what\u2019s actually going on?\n\nMax: Hmm. I think the scale of the backlash is basically \u201ccorrect,\u201d if somewhat misguided or poorly aimed, if that makes sense.\n\nBen: What do you mean by \u201cmisguided or poorly aimed\u201d?\n\nMax: Like I said above, I\u2019m not super-convinced that the question of lies in political ads is really central to the deleterious effects Facebook has on society. But I think Facebook is very, very bad for the world, in a bunch of obvious and direct ways (ethnic cleansing!) and in a bunch of ways more diffuse and difficult to disentangle (its role in shoring up an economy of misinformation, say).\n\nBen: And on top of all that, it\u2019s extremely boring.\n\nMax: Lol. And it\u2019s boring!\n\nI mean, more than anything else, and at the risk of getting woo-woo cyberpunk here, I think that we still don\u2019t really understand what Facebook \u201cis,\u201d or what it\u2019s \u201cdoing,\u201d or what its effects will be. And I think the first priority here should be to slow down its growth and its entanglement in institutions that we have a clearer grasp of. And if we can do that, and begin to diagnose how it interacts with our institutions and civil society, we can begin to pick out what the right regulation might look like. One major problem we face is that Facebook is so large, and moves so quickly \u2014 and secretly \u2014 that it\u2019s often not until 18 months or two years or more later that we begin to see the effects of a given change to its operations, at which point it may have reversed the change, or accelerated it \u2014 and meanwhile regulators and critics are working with incomplete information.\n\nBen: Would you say it moves fast and breaks things?\n\nMax: Wow \u2014 what a perfectly pithy summation of how Facebook works.\n\nBrian: My final thought is if a politician lies to me, I\u2019m gonna be mad about it.
