This year, they must face three Tier One nations in England, France and Argentina in their first three games in Pool C.\n\nThe U.S. lost 28-10 to England in 2007 on the way to finishing winless and last in its pool, and the difference this time might be bigger. The U.S. also finished bottom of its pool with an 0-4 record at the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, with all due respect, we\u2019re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that,\u201d Gold, a South African, said when asked for his reaction to Jones\u2019 15 Donald Trumps comparison. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a lively few days at the start of the World Cup from Jones, even by the cheeky Aussie\u2019s standards.\n\nThe Trump comment came a day after he was asked by a Japanese reporter to explain his reference to two of his England players being \u201ckamikaze kids.\u201d\n\nJones, a former Japan coach who has Japanese heritage through his mother, said he used the term to describe young flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill because of their ferocious defensive work. Kamikaze is a sensitive word in Japan because of its reference to airplane pilots who flew suicide missions against U.S. and other Allied ships in World War II.\n\nAnd after England\u2019s first game against Tonga in Sapporo, on Japan\u2019s northern Hokkaido island, Jones said it was special to take rugby to a region unfamiliar with the game. Then, he added Hokkaido was \u201ccloser to Russia than you probably want to be.\u201d Russia is also playing at this Rugby World Cup.\n\nDespite Jones\u2019 early exuberance in Japan, his team was patchy against Tonga, only secured a bonus point in the last three minutes and didn\u2019t provide him with a compelling start to the tournament following a compelling final warmup when England beat Ireland 57-15 and Italy 37-0.\n\nInstead, England will aim to ramp up its performance against the Americans in Kobe on Thursday, although the English will only have three full days off after the Tonga game and Jones made 10 changes to his starting lineup to manage that quick turnaround. Flyhalf George Ford takes over the captaincy from Owen Farrell, who is on the bench. Prop Dan Cole comes in to play his 91st test and move level with 2003 World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson in third on England\u2019s all-time caps list.\n\nIn contrast, while the English were taking on the hefty Tongans up in Hokkaido, the U.S. has been in camp on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa for two weeks preparing for its entrance at the World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe know they\u2019ve been down in Okinawa preparing with Marines so they\u2019ll be hardened for battle,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe U.S. squad going to Okinawa also seemed a strange choice, politically, with protests there last year over the U.S.\u2019s long-term military presence, which dates back to World War II. Still, there\u2019s no indication that the Americans have been anything other than comfortable in Okinawa, with the Japanese hospitality at Asia\u2019s first Rugby World Cup described as excellent by teams.\n\nAgainst England, the Eagles may get some help from many of their players having experience of England and English players. Four starters - hooker Joe Taufete\u2019e, prop Titi Lamositele, flyhalf AJ MacGinty and center Paul Lasike - play in the English Premiership, as does reserve back Bryce Campbell. The U.S. has eight players in its squad attached to English clubs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get better,\u201d said U.S. captain and wing Blaine Scully, who formerly played in England. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we can improve and we are improving. That\u2019s where our focus is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly, Ruaridh McConnochie, Jonathan Joseph, Piers Francis, Joe Cokanasiga, George Ford (captain), Willi Heinz; Billy Vunipola, Lewis Ludlam, Tom Curry, George Kruis, Joe Launchbury, Dan Cole, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler.
