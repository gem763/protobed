The incident follows the federal government\u2019s released of a son of \u201cEl Chapo\u201d after his cartel overpowered the military in Sinaloa.\n\nThe case began on Friday afternoon in Santa Clara del Cobre when dozens of gunmen torched vehicles and blocked roads to pressure officials to release Angel \u201cEl Camaleon\u201d Chavez Ponce. Law enforcement sources told Breitbart Texas that Chavez Ponce earned his nickname for a penchant to crossdress. He is also responsible for a rash of kidnappings and murders in the vicinity.\n\nThis week, Michoac\u00e1n Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo and his state police chief, Israel Patron Reyes, claimed there was no operation to capture El Camaleon. Instead, the raid recovered a stolen tractor-trailer moving a shipment of solar panels near Aro de Rosales.\n\nThe Michoac\u00e1n government\u2019s denial comes days after the Sinaloa Cartel overpowered military and police forces in Culiacan, leaving federal top cop Alfonso Durazo to release Ovidio \u201cEl Raton\u201d Guzman.\n\nDespite the fresh denial, authorities previously arrested El Camaleon in January, however, state officials released him and some associates shortly thereafter under suspicious circumstances. Later, El Camaleon recorded himself murdering a man by tying him to a tree and shooting repeatedly. For that murder, El Camaleon and his cell from La Familia Michoacana kidnapped Hugo Figueroa, a cattle rancher and entertainment businessman who hosted a local bull riding event. Figueroa was the nephew of the late musician Joan Sebastian.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
