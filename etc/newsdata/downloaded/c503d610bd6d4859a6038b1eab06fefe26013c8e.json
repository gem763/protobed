The Storm Prediction Center warned again of \u201cextremely critical fire weather\u201d throughout Southern California. Parts of Northern California, including the North Bay mountains, were expected to see \u201cwidespread critical fire weather conditions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Kincade Fire in the Bay Area has been 30 percent contained, while the Getty Fire burning in Los Angeles was 15 percent contained as of Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, another fire \u2014 dubbed the Easy Fire \u2014 broke out in Ventura County, burning through 200 acres and forcing mandatory evacuation orders upon residents in the area surrounding the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley.\n\nThe conditions fueling the fires in Southern California have officials especially nervous: The National Weather Service in Oxnard went so far as to issue an \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning in the Los Angeles area, underscoring just how dangerous the winds could become.\n\nAD\n\nNWS meteorologist Tom Fisher told the Los Angeles Times that the Santa Ana winds could be the worst the region has seen since 2007, when dangerous weather fueled the sixth most destructive fire in California history.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a terribly dangerous moment,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said Tuesday, as the Getty Fire continued to burn. \u201cWe will continue to protect and defend this city with everything that we have.\u201d\n\nFire crews are battling two main blazes in the state right now.\n\nIn the north, the Kincade Fire \u2014 this year\u2019s largest wildfire \u2014 had grown to 76,825 acres in Sonoma County by Wednesday morning, according to the Cal Fire. At least 206 structures had been destroyed, 94 of them residential. The blaze was 30 percent contained.\n\nAD\n\nThough fire officials prepared to beat back pop-up blazes brought on by expected winds overnight, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the gusts did not come.\n\n\u201cDiablo\u201d winds had been expected to reach 70 mph in Northern California but stayed mostly around 50 mph, the Chronicle reported. The National Weather Service canceled its wind advisory in the area just after 2 a.m. local time.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any concern from wind doing any damage now,\u201d Weather Service meteorologist Matt Mehle told the Chronicle. \u201cThe red flag warning is still in effect. We\u2019re still seeing widespread lower humidity with all the dry fuel out there, but for now we seem to be done with the wind.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe winds in Southern California, though, have only gotten worse.\n\nFire crews there are still trying to contain the Getty Fire, which sparked Monday when a tree branch fell on power lines in Los Angeles County. As of Tuesday evening, the fire, on the western edge of Los Angeles, was 15 percent contained, and officials were bracing for a new wave of Santa Ana winds that could bring 80 mph gusts.\n\nThe Getty Fire had consumed about 656 acres as of Tuesday night and forced the evacuation of more than 7,000 homes. At least 12 homes have been destroyed in the blaze, and five others have been damaged, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nThe record-strong Santa Ana winds are expected to last through at least Thursday morning.\n\nAD\n\nThis Santa Ana wind episode has the potential to be the worst of the season. Coming on the heels of other offshore windstorms, it means that any ignition sources, like a stray cigarette or a sparking power line, would find extremely flammable vegetation that\u2019s ready to burn.\n\nAn estimated 18 million Californians live in areas designated as being in \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire risk on Wednesday. These are the two most serious risk categories.\n\nRed flag warnings extend from San Francisco north to the California border with Oregon, as wind gusts to 60 mph at times are forecast on Wednesday along with low humidity levels that will make firefighting difficult in this area.\n\nAD\n\nMuch of the fire weather concerns on Wednesday through Thursday, however, will center on Southern California, where the National Weather Service took the unprecedented step of issuing an \u201cExtreme Red Flag Warning\u201d to communicate the severity of the event now underway. As of 6 a.m. local time, peak wind gusts in Los Angeles and Ventura counties had reached 65 mph, but the NWS warns that gusts up to 80 mph are possible before about 4 p.m. today.\n\nAD\n\nThese winds, combined with humidity levels in the low single digits, and vegetation that has already dried out from previous Santa Ana wind events, are creating an explosive situation in which any fire that ignites could drastically expand in size within a short time period.\n\n\u201cExtreme fire behavior,\u201d such as embers igniting new blazes up to a mile ahead of the fire front, would be possible in such an environment, the NWS office in Los Angeles said.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the key factors that forecasters use in predicting the strength of offshore wind events in California is the pressure gradient between coastal portions of the state and areas far inland. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the winds will be. On Wednesday, forecasters at both the NWS office in Los Angeles and the Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, which issues fire threat outlooks, were warning of near-record offshore pressure gradients for October. This is especially significant because October is the month when California sees most of its offshore wind events.\n\nAD\n\nThe highest winds are expected in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, as well as areas to the south, with extremely critical fire weather conditions projected for inland portions of San Diego County as well.\n\nEvacuations have largely gone smoothly as the nation\u2019s most populous state adapts to increasing wildfires that many officials link to climate change.\n\nAD\n\nOfficials in Sonoma County said Wednesday morning that many schools and districts in the area will remain closed through Friday, and Los Angeles County authorities warned commuters and travelers to build extra time into their plans.\n\n\u201cHigh winds can make your drive extremely dangerous,\u201d the county wrote on Twitter.\n\nDerek Hawkins, Marisa Iati and Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Much of California is under a red flag warning as firefighters continue to battle the Kincade Fire in the north and the Getty Fire down south.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZpmFvvStiyt4-Xr7nKd1qLrxtOg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YSIE34H3AMI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
