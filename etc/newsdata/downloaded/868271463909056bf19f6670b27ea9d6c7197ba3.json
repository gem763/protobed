That cash is expected to come in seven days after the deal is signed (subject to shareholder approval).\n\nThere\u2019s also the tender offer for up to $3 billion worth of non-SoftBank owned shares at a price of $19.19 per share, which will begin in the fourth quarter of this year, with closing subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nFinally there\u2019s a joint venture share swap where all of SoftBank Vision Fund\u2019s interests in regional joint ventures outside of Japan will be exchanged for WeWork shares at a price of $11.60 per share\u2019 and a debt facility consisting of $1.1 billion in senior secured notes, $2.2 billion in unsecured notes, and a $1.75 billion letter of credit facility, which will occur after the tender offer is completed.\n\nAfter the closing and the tender offer, SoftBank will own approximately 80 percent of the We Company, according to a statement.\n\nHowever, SoftBank will not actually hold a majority of voting rights at any stockholder or board of directors meeting, thanks to WeWork\u2019s convoluted ownership structure. Therefore, even with its 80 percent stake in the business, WeWork isn\u2019t a subsidiary, but an \u201cassociate\u201d of SoftBank.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the company confirmed that Adam Neumann will become a board observer and Marcelo Claure, the chief operating officer of SoftBank Group will assume the position of executive chairman of the board of directors of WeWork \u2014 as soon as the company receives its $1.5 billion payment from SoftBank.\n\n\u201cSoftBank is a firm believer that the world is undergoing a massive transformation in the way people work. WeWork is at the forefront of this revolution. It is not unusual for the world\u2019s leading technology disruptors to experience growth challenges as the one WeWork just faced,\u201d said Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of SoftBank Group Corp, in a statement. \u201cSince the vision remains unchanged, SoftBank has decided to double down on the company by providing a significant capital infusion and operational support. We remain committed to WeWork, its employees, its member customers and landlords.\u201d\n\nThe vision may remain unchanged, but the story that SoftBank will have to tell about its new \u201cassociate.\u201d Under Neumann\u2019s stewardship, We Company was a cash-burning, globe-spanning, all-encompassing community developer that would usher in a new kind of capitalism, operating under the banner of \u201cWe\u201d.\n\nNow, the company is more like a struggling purveyor of temporary office space, which has a mountain of leases it owns and is looking down the barrel of a potential cash crunch \u2014 even with the SoftBank lifeline.\n\nStill, SoftBank\u2019s executives and WeWork\u2019s new leadership are standing by their rhetoric for what the company is\u2026 and can be.\n\n\u201cWeWork is redefining the nature of work by creating meaningful experiences through integrating design, technology and community. The new capital SoftBank is providing will restore momentum to the company and I am committed to delivering profitability and positive free cash flow,\u201d said Claure in a statement. \u201cAs important as the financial implications, this investment demonstrates our confidence in WeWork and its ability to continue to lead in disrupting the commercial real estate market by delivering flexible, collaborative and productive work environments to our customers.\u201d", "description": "Confirming earlier reports, The We Company and SoftBank Group agreed to a new capital infusion which will see SoftBank committing $5 billion in new financing and issuing a tender offer for another $3 billion in buybacks for shareholders.
