USA TODAY\n\nJim Harbaugh needed this. His team needed this, too. But Harbaugh needed it more.\n\nTo remind his players what this feels like. To remind himself what it feels like. When the defense swarms and the offense rolls and the 100,000-plus fans in the stadium roar.\n\nIt has been a while, no?\n\nBeen a while since Harbaugh\u2019s Michigan Wolverines took the field against a top-10 team and throttled them. No, demoralized them.\n\nThat was easy to see Saturday night under the lights, when the rain finally lifted, and Notre Dame\u2019s shoulders began to sag in No. 20 Michigan's 45-14 demolition. And by the time senior running back Tru Wilson took a handoff, cut to his left, and scooted 27 yards for a touchdown, it was all over but the dancing.\n\nNot that Michigan fans dance much. But for the first time in a few years, no one would\u2019ve blamed them.\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh watches the action during Saturday's game against Notre Dame. (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, Detroit Free Press)\n\nNow, maybe the No. 7 Fighting Irish aren\u2019t that good. They arrived in Ann Arbor with a 5-1 record, a loss to Georgia and a narrow win over middling USC in their game two weeks ago.\n\nStill, they were a top-10 team. A playoff team a year ago. A roster built on top-flight recruiting classes and several future pros.\n\nSo \u2026\n\n\u2026 yeah, Michigan took the field against a team of equal \u2014 or near equal \u2014 talent and blitzed it. The defense played a lot like it did in the second half at Beaver Stadium last Saturday, when Penn State kept getting the ball and punting it after three downs.\n\nThis Saturday night, the Fighting Irish punted nine times \u2014 nine. They rushed for 47 yards. Passed for 133. This is a team that had averaged close to 450 yards a game.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s fair to wonder about Notre Dame\u2019s schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to wonder about Michigan's mental toughness.\n\nNot anymore. Not this group.\n\nFOOTBALL FOUR: Alabama and LSU on collision course\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Who surged, who faltered during Week 9?\n\nMICHIGAN: Used five-man sledgehammer to take down No. 7 Notre Dame\n\nOHIO STATE: Big-time players have Buckeyes looking like a No. 1 team\n\nA week ago, this same team found its way from a 21-point hole in the first half in State College. It came up a play short in the end when Ronnie Bell dropped a pass in the end zone.\n\nThe sophomore receiver stood on the sideline in damn near shock as Penn State iced the game. Several of his teammates met with reporters after the game carrying similar expressions.\n\nAnd yet \u2026 underneath the disappointment you could tell the team thought it had found something. Harbaugh sounded optimistic, even considering the brutal nature of the loss.\n\nYou can argue the team found it too late. And it might be, if all that matters is a Big Ten title.\n\nBut he\u2019s trying to reboot a program, too.\n\nHarbaugh made a lot of change this offseason and has been searching for ways to push his team to the top of the conference. For a while, his team looked stuck between all of the change.\n\nNot against Notre Dame. Not in the rain. Not when Michigan knew it would have to line up and control the line of scrimmage.\n\nSpeed and space may sound nice, but it doesn\u2019t work so well in the rain.\n\nBlocking and tackling do. As does running the football, which the Wolverines did all game.\n\nMichigan ran for 303 yards, led by Hassan Haskins and Zach Charbonnet. They ran through holes as wide as the stadium, and when they met defenders in the secondary, they ran over them.\n\nOr leapt over them.\n\nOr stiff-armed them, as Haskins did on a 49-yard run in the third quarter after Notre Dame had cut the lead to 10. His burst up the middle set up a Shea Patterson touchdown pass to Donovan Peoples-Jones, and whatever hope the Fighting Irish had was gone.\n\nFor the first time all season, and maybe the first time in a couple of years, the Wolverines took the field against a respectable opponent and played with the kind of force Harbaugh\u2019s best teams used to do.\n\nYes, maybe it came a week too late. Maybe if they came out a week ago the same way they did Saturday, we\u2019d be having a different conversation.\n\nYet progress is still worth something, right? Because Harbaugh\u2019s program finally showed some.\n\nAll it took was a little rain and a lot of attitude.\n\nContact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com.
