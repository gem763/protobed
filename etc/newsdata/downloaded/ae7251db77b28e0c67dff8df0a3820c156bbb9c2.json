Between 2005 and 2009, every few months someone discovered a female body dumped either in a waterway or on a desolate back road. There were eight in total, and they fit a pattern:\n\nThe women were, quite literally, from the wrong side of the tracks.\n\nThey were local sex workers and drug users between the ages of 17 and 30; they were members of the parish\u2019s thriving informant culture and provided a steady flow of information to local law enforcement; they were all linked to Frankie Richard, a known partyer, pimp and drug dealer; and they all knew each other.\n\nTheir murders \u2014 known as \u201cthe Jeff Davis 8\u201d \u2014 have been cold cases for nearly 15 years, but a new Showtime docuseries has revived interest in the investigation. Based on a book written by investigative journalist Ethan Brown, \u201cMurder in the Bayou\u201d chronicles the eight unsolved homicides and the events that led up to them, and exposes the Jennings drug trade, systemic police misconduct and political corruption. The information for this article draws from reporting aired on the series, unless otherwise noted.\n\n[A new prostitution scandal roils a Louisiana Senate race]\n\nDays had passed before Loretta Chaisson Lewis\u2019s corpse was discovered, decomposing in a canal in May 2005. Her body, the first of the eight, rocked the 10,000-person town; at the time, only one victim had been found, but the sheriff received multiple calls inquiring whether there was a serial killer on the loose.\n\nA group of froggers found a second body several weeks later. Two months went by before authorities identified, through bone samples, the victim: 30-year-old Ernestine Marie Daniels Patterson. She had been discarded in a waterway six miles from where Lewis was discovered. Patterson\u2019s injuries were different. Her throat was slit. The district attorney\u2019s office charged two men with the murder and then dismissed the case, leaving the Patterson family with no closure, her mother Evelyn said in the docuseries.\n\nTwo years later, there was a third victim.\n\nA fisherman found the body of Kristen Gary Lopez naked and rotting in the water. The strikingly similar circumstances led local law enforcement to treat it as a homicide.\n\nThe 21-year-old had gone missing nearly two weeks earlier. In the days leading up to her disappearance, friends remembered her increasing paranoia. Still, one said during an interview, they assumed she had gone on a drug bender.\n\nIn May 2017, Frankie Richard and his goddaughter were brought in by the sheriff\u2019s department on a warrant for the homicide, and they were quietly released days later.\n\nAfter Lopez\u2019s murder, then-sheriff Ricky Edwards announced that the three victims were linked to prostitution and drug use. He attributed the deaths, in part, to their \u201chigh-risk lifestyles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made these girls sound disposable,\u201d a victim\u2019s relative recalled.\n\nThe same month, two new victims turned up. Whitnei Dubois\u2019s badly beaten, nude body was found by Jamie Trahan, a known police informant, under circumstances that Brown said \u201cdidn\u2019t add up.\u201d Then Laconia \u201cMuggy\u201d Brown\u2019s body was found by a local police officer; she had been doused in bleach and abandoned on the back roads. In 2008, the sixth victim, Crystal Shay Benoit Zeno, was discovered dead in the woods.\n\nBrittney Gary, the youngest victim at 17 years old, was found later that year, dumped on side of a road. On Aug. 19, 2009, after the formation of a task force to help solve the cases, roadway workers found an eighth body along the side of Interstate 10.\n\n\u201cI am not going to be here to see my birthday,\u201d the last-known victim, Necole Guillory, had warned her mother in the days leading to her death.\n\nEdwards had avoided crediting a serial killer for the growing list of mysterious deaths. After Zeno, though, he hedged. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d he said. Like the first three victims, with whom Dubois, Brown, and Zeno were acquainted, the women were also known to authorities as a drug users and sex workers.\n\n\u201cWe either have a serial dumper,\" Edwards continued. \"We could have a serial killer.\u201d\n\nAfter Guillory\u2019s body was found, Edwards doubled down on the single-offender theory.\n\n\n\nEthan Brown in \"Murder in the Bayou.\" (Showtime)\n\nBrown, the journalist, happened upon Jefferson Davis Parish in 2010, more than a year after the last homicide. He noticed billboards featuring the faces of the eight women, offering an $85,000 reward to anyone with information about their murders while driving on Interstate 10 from New Orleans to Louisiana.\n\nAfter reviewing thousands of documents and video interviews taken by the task force, Brown concluded, \u201cThe serial killer theory didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nHis research showed that many of the women were police informants who had witnessed other murders and most had relationships \u2014 often sexual \u2014 with members of law enforcement. Although the district attorney\u2019s office dropped both prosecutions, he noted that two people were charged with Patterson\u2019s murder and two people were arrested in Lopez\u2019s, details that suggested multiple people, not one, were involved.\n\nBrown also noticed a cast of characters and circumstances appear repeatedly, oftentimes from people with firsthand knowledge of the homicides: witnesses implicated the same officers and wardens in the murders and intimated that members of the sheriff\u2019s office, including the chief investigator, may have been part of the coverup.\n\nLaw enforcement has denied involvement in the Jennings 8 murders.\n\n\u201cThey all knew each other well,\u201d Brown said, and most of them shared a pimp: Frankie Richard.\n\nOn camera, Richard said, \u201cThese girls lost their lives because they seen something, heard something, knew something that they was not supposed to know.\u201d\n\nTo this day, Richard, who has been arrested in Jefferson Davis Parish 23 times but has never been convicted, denies any involvement in the deaths of the women. Still, in the last episode Ramby Cormier, commander of the parish sheriff\u2019s office, said: \u201cFrankie Richard remains a person of interest, currently.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrankie Richard in \"Murder in the Bayou.\" (Showtime)\n\nHours before the series premiered, Richard overdosed, according to people familiar with the case. He was arrested after leaving the hospital and booked on unrelated soliciting prostitution and drug charges at the Acadia Parish jail, where he remains on $86,000 bond.\n\nThis is the first time since 2007, when he was held briefly in the Lopez homicide, that he has done any real time, Brown told The Washington Post. \u201cHaving Frankie on ice \u2014 which they haven\u2019t had in over a decade \u2014 is a big deal in town. He flaunts his impunity. It has this really frightening effect on the entire parish.\u201d\n\n[Victims, Families and America\u2019s Thirst for True-Crime Stories]\n\n\u201cMurder in the Bayou\u201d is not a whodunit series; there\u2019s no big reveal in the final episode.\n\n\u201cThere was an effort to not only dehumanize but erase the eight women,\u201d Brown said to The Post. In large part, his work is an attempt to ensure they aren\u2019t erased from history.\n\nExecutive producer and director Matthew Galkin said that from the get-go it seemed unlikely they would crack the cases of the Jeff Davis 8.\n\n\u201cThe idea that eight women who all knew each other could be killed in a town of 10,000 people and go unsolved seemed shocking to me,\u201d Galkin said in a phone interview. \u201cThese women seemed to be completely marginalized. We were able to paint an emotional landscape of the town and bring them to life in a way they hadn\u2019t been during their lives or in their deaths.\"\n\nInvestigators claim they hope the renewed and continued coverage leads to solving the murders. Others are less optimistic, some even skeptical that there is, in fact, an active and ongoing investigation; the public has yet to see any results.\n\nAnd then there are the Jennings residents who are still mourning \u2014 the family and friends of the eight women from the wrong side of the tracks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not 2000 anymore,\u201d Lopez\u2019s friend, Jessica Kratzer, said. \u201cMaybe other people will get the courage to step up and speak on what they know. It\u2019s just a wish. Hopefully it comes true.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHe robbed a bank the day before his wedding, sheriff says.
