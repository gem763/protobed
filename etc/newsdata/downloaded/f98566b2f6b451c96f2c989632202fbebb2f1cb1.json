He will forever be stained with that legacy.\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump announced that acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was leaving the administration after six months on the job. The president tweeted that they had \u201cworked well together with Border Crossings being way down.\u201d McAleenan, who replaced Kirstjen Nielsen in April, was Trump\u2019s fourth homeland security chief.\n\nNews accounts of McAleenan\u2019s departure generally praised him as professional and apolitical. But such kind words do not accurately reflect his shameful legacy. McAleenan actively worked to gut asylum law. He rolled out harsh restrictions on legal immigration. He dismissed concerns about inhumane conditions in immigrant detention. And he was among the architects of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that resulted in the horror of family separations.\n\nHarming immigrant communities\n\nAt Homeland Security, McAleenan presided over two policies that severely restricted the legal right to claim asylum at our southern border. He dramatically expanded the Migrant Protection Protocols program that forces asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while their claims are heard in the United States. Nearly 58,000 asylum-seekers have been left to await their fate on the Mexican side of the border. Some tire of the waiting and abandon their claims; others fall victim to kidnappers and criminals who target returned migrants.\n\nA migrant holding station in McAllen, Texas, on June 11, 2019.

These \"safe third country\" agreements basically outsource our border crisis to countries that are not safe and that lack functioning asylum systems. These deals mean that Central American women, children and LGBTQ refugees will face hardship, violence and even death \u2014 all because the United States has abandoned its commitment to providing humanitarian relief to those fleeing persecution.\n\nA true crisis: Asylum-seekers I meet flee something even worse than Trump's unethical immigration agenda\n\nIn August, McAleenan\u2019s DHS unveiled its \u201cpublic charge\" rule, which would make it more difficult for immigrants to obtain green cards. The rule would deny legal residency to immigrants who have used, or were deemed likely to use, government services. Think of the rule as codifying Trump\u2019s preference as reported by CNN, for immigrants from Norway rather than those from \u201cs---hole countries.\u201d\n\nThe rule would likely benefit wealthy, educated European and Canadian immigrants over working-class people from Africa and Latin America. Although it has been blocked by the courts for now, some legal immigrants and their families have already stopped accessing public services to which they are in fact entitled.\n\nAt DHS, McAleenan proved himself unworthy of public trust. In June, he denied reports of squalid conditions for immigrants in detention, calling the allegations \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and the facilities \u201cclean and well-managed.\u201d Yet, a July report from DHS\u2019 inspector general found widespread overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in detention. Either McAleenan was woefully ignorant about conditions that his agency was supposed to be overseeing, or he was lying about them. Immigrant advocacy groups have called out McAleenan for falsely suggesting to Congress that most asylum-seekers do not show up for court appearances.\n\nMisplaced priorities by the DHS\n\nMcAleenan\u2019s DHS also directed resources away from the threat of right-wing, domestic terrorism. It was only after the massacre of 22 Latinos in El Paso, Texas, that he called for more funds to fight dangerous, homegrown ideologies, saying, \u201cWe need to invest more.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump tweeted that McAleenan was leaving DHS because he \u201cwants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\u201d How ironic that McAleenan seeks family time, in contrast to the thousands of parents and children who were affected by the Trump administration\u2019s family separations. It was McAleenan who co-wrote the memo stating that DHS could \u201cdirect the separation of parents or legal guardians and minors held in immigration detention so that the parent or legal guardian can be prosecuted.\u201d He owns the family separations debacle as much as his DHS predecessor, Nielsen.\n\nIgnoring our legacy: Asylum-seekers I meet flee something even worse than Trump's unethical immigration agenda\n\nIn hindsight, McAleenan says that the family separations \u201cwent too far.\u201d But he might be saying that because he is concerned about his future. Last week, he was shouted off the stage at a conference, so he may find the private sector less than welcoming. Just as some migrant families will be forever traumatized by their forced separations, McAleenan\u2019s reputation will be forever tarnished by his enforcement of such an abhorrent policy.\n\nTrue, McAleenan helped Trump achieve his goal of curtailing arrivals at the southern border. Migrant apprehensions have dropped from nearly 133,000 in May to nearly 51,000 in August.\n\nYet at what cost? McAleenan is leaving his agency in turmoil, wracked by low morale. He facilitated immigration policies rooted in racism and xenophobia. He allowed himself to be the public face, on immigration, of an amoral administration. He disregarded the safety of detainees and asylum-seekers in service to a president who sees migrants as invaders.\n\nOver the past six months, McAleenan has destroyed his credibility, exacerbated the humanitarian crisis at the border and betrayed American values. His tenure at DHS is a sad example of unprincipled, failed leadership.\n\nRaul Reyes, an attorney, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
