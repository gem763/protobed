There is too much corruption in this country,\" he said.\n\nAround 13 million of Mozambique's 30 million citizens were registered to vote in elections for the presidency, parliament and provincial governors.\n\nVote counting has started and preliminary results are expected to be announced on Thursday.\n\nBut with some concerns over irregularities Renamo's presidential candidate Ossufo Momade, 58, warned: \"If these results are manipulated we will never accept them, we do not want a return to the problems of the past.\"\n\nClaims of pre-marked ballots\n\nAfter 44 years, Frelimo will see its stranglehold on power loosen due to a deal with Renamo to allow voters to elect provincial governors, who had previously been nominated by the government.\n\nRenamo is predicted to take control of three to five of Mozambique's 10 provinces, according to analysts.\n\nMomade heads a party of former anti-communist rebels who fought a brutal civil war with Frelimo from 1975-1992, devastating the economy and leaving almost one million people dead.\n\nRenamo picked up arms again from 2013 to 2016, although tensions continued until Nyusi and Momade sealed the peace deal in August.\n\nAn armed breakaway faction of Renamo rejected Momade's candidacy and threatened the campaign.\n\nAs the vote neared candidates were threatened, election material destroyed, and deadly clashes broke out between rival party supporters.\n\nThe situation escalated last week when a prominent election observer was shot dead at the wheel of his car in the southeastern Gaza province by members of a special police unit.\n\nBefore the first vote was cast, the opposition had accused Frelimo of election tampering. Civil society groups estimated there are hundreds of thousands of \"ghost voters\" - names on the electoral roll not aligned with real, potential voters.\n\n\"We noted some problems today in the provinces of Tete, Nampula and Zambezia, where voters were caught with several ballot papers marked in favour of Frelimo before casting their vote,\" said Dercio Alfazema of the election monitoring group Sala da Paz.\n\nElection official Felisberto Naife confirmed the incidents, but did not comment further.\n\nLutero Simango, an MP of the country's third biggest party MDM, accused Frelimo of \"using all state means, including police and secret services, to intimidate people\".\n\nHe urged observers not leave the polling stations.\n\n\"Experience has shown us that on the day of voting the climate is peaceful and normal. The problems occur during the counting process,\" he said.\n\nScandals and setbacks\n\nFrelimo, which suffered its worst result at the ballot box in 2018 local elections, has been severely weakened in recent years.\n\nIn 2016 it was revealed the government secretly borrowed $2bn, sparking the worst financial crisis in the country's history and uncovering a vast corruption network with links to the regime.\n\nThe government is also battling to recover from two devastating cyclones in March which displaced nearly two million people.\n\nAnd a shadowy jihadist insurgency that has killed hundreds in the northernmost Cabo Delgado province has delayed development of one of the government's biggest selling points -- the discovery of vast gas reserves that is hoped to put billions in state coffers and lift millions out of poverty.\n\nThe instability in the north forced the National Election Commission to close 10 polling stations, leaving more than 5000 voters unable to cast their ballot.", "description": "Mozambique voted in a general election hailed by the president as a sign the country was progressing \"peacefully\", as fears the poll could be marred by violence proved unwarranted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/381/05c4f7552c1b486ebaf8172dea657b65.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
