I don't know why you chose me. You're not asking the honourable [Gwede] Mantashe to step down to make way for a woman.\"\n\nHe said he took Mphithi's point that when he and Ramaphosa were included, there was not a 50/50 split but there was 50% female representation when ministers were taken into account.\n\n\"I will consider to step down next time. Not now. Not now. Not now.\"\n\nAfter the elections in May, there was speculation that Ramaphosa would appoint a female deputy president but in the end he reappointed Mabuza.", "description": "Deputy President David Mabuza has aligned himself with President Cyril Ramaphosa on one of the most vexing issues in the ANC and its broader alliance: The direction South Africa should take on economic reforms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7443/4b1fc9929f9949daace79087e3087c90.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
