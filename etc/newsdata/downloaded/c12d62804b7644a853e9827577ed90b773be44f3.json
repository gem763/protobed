I don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart but sometimes you have to do something extreme in order to make a simple point.\u201d\n\nSyatt merely wanted to hammer that point home.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of it was to show people that you can include your favorite foods into your diet in moderation and not only not lose progress, but actually continue to make progress, because so many people worry about ruining their entire diet if they go off track for one meal, whatever it is.\u201d\n\nSyatt\u2019s aim was to show people they can eat less nutrient-dense foods without worrying.\n\nsource Jordan Syatt\n\n\u201cI want you to be able to go to your daughter\u2019s birthday party and have a slice of pizza without feeling guilty or ashamed or worry that you\u2019re ruining your progress; or to go to your nephew\u2019s graduation ceremony and have a slice of cake; or just literally to be able to go out on a Friday night with your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife and have ice cream without feeling like you\u2019re ruining everything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause a lot of people have one of those meals, they\u2019ll feel really guilty about it, think they screwed up, and then they\u2019ll just completely give up altogether. This is how yo-yo dieting is made, because people feel like they screwed up.\n\n\u201cThey go off track, then get back on track. Basically it\u2019s either all in or all out. And I wanted to show people, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. It doesn\u2019t have to be all in or all out. You can incorporate your favorite foods while still making progress.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the month, Syatt went out for dinner various times and also attended a wedding, and he is open about the fact that he \u201cindulged\u201d and went over his calorie goal on some days.\n\n\u201cBut the main recurring theme was I got right back on track as soon as I was home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was in a deficit the majority of the time.\u201d\n\nHis weight fluctuated throughout the challenge\n\nSyatt documented the whole challenge on social media, filming every Big Mac he ate and every time he stood on the scale \u2013 the whole journey is saved in the pinned stories on his Instagram profile.\n\nAs Syatt\u2019s followers the graph of his weight rise and fall but overall head in a downward trajectory, Syatt\u2019s message became ever clearer.\n\ncaption How Jordan Syatt\u2019s weight fluctuated throughout the Big Mac challenge. source Jordan Syatt\n\nWeight fluctuations are normal, and Syatt appreciates that seven pounds is \u201ca lot\u201d to lose in a month.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, what you\u2019ll notice if you track your weight over the course of time, you will see a consistent pattern in how your weight fluctuates,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s for this reason that he actually recommends people log their weight once month, comparing, say, October 1 to November 1 as a more reliable way to measure progress, although he says you can also weigh yourself every day to see the overall trend.\n\nRead more: Jessica Simpson lost 100 pounds by walking 14,000 steps a day, prioritizing sleep, and not doing anything \u2018too painful\u2019\n\nSyatt encourages people to see the number on the scale simply as data, not as something that affects how you feel.\n\n\u201cFor me, when I have a general idea of knowing when I\u2019m going to spike, when I\u2019m going to drop, when I\u2019m going to plateau, it takes away the emotion because I just know, I know more logically what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know if I ate more salt the day before then the scale will probably be up. I know if I\u2019ve had trouble pooing the scale will probably be up. I know if I had a really heavy leg workout, my weight will always be up as I\u2019ll be holding on to more glycogen.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s really just not looking at the scale as a definitive marker of progress, good or bad, and more as a tool.\u201d\n\nsource Jordan Syatt\n\nHe added: \u201cA lot of fitness professionals say, \u2018Don\u2019t step on a scale. It\u2019s evil.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a f\u2014ing machine that gets out a number at you. It\u2019s not evil. You just have to teach people how to use it.\u201d\n\nYou can include foods you love in your diet and still reach your goals\n\nHis main message throughout the challenge was that you can still make progress by eating a little bit of what you fancy.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that you\u2019re either making progress or you\u2019re destroying your progress.\n\n\u201cThere is a middle ground that you can find where you can enjoy your favorite food while actually continuing to move forward and achieve your goals without feeling like a failure.\u201d\n\nSyatt explained that he\u2019s not trying to glorify the Big Mac, but he\u2019s not demonizing it either.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to demonize any certain foods,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we want to promote healthy habits and promote how to be able to understand how much you\u2019re eating without feeling like a failure if you end up enjoying a f\u2014ing ice cream cone, God forbid, or a slice of pizza or something like that.\u201d\n\nBig Macs don\u2019t have a great reputation, but their nutritional profile is actually better than most people think \u2013 in the US, the signature McDonald\u2019s burger contains 540 calories and 25g protein.\n\nBefore the challenge, Syatt said he had only ever had a Big Mac about once or twice in his life, and it was so long ago he couldn\u2019t even remember if he enjoyed them. It turns out he does.\n\nIncredibly, however, he didn\u2019t grow sick of them.\n\nIf you\u2019re in an overall calorie deficit, you\u2019ll lose weight\n\nSyatt wanted to show people that no certain food makes you gain or lose weight, it\u2019s just about managing your energy balance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise in the fitness industry, there are a lot of people who say carbs are going to make you fat, or fat makes you fat. There are people who say fruit is going to make you fat for f\u2014\u2018s sake.\n\n\u201cSo what I want to do is just show people that the most important thing when it comes to fat loss is moderating your total energy, your calorie intake.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI really wanted to take away food anxiety, eliminate food anxiety, and allow people to enjoy their lives about being ruled by nutrition every waking moment. And I think that\u2019s what the challenge accomplished.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow calorie-counting actually helped me develop a healthier relationship with food\n\nI lost 35 pounds in 6 months without going on a diet, and it taught me 7 lessons about eating for healthy fat loss\n\nI struggle to eat healthy food and fit in exercise when I\u2019m busy and stressed.
