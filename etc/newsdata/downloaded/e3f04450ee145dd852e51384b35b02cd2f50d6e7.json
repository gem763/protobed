They\u2019ll be dropping in every now and again, sharing their expertise on the basics you don\u2019t have time to research and the weird and wonderful things you don\u2019t yet know you need.\n\nLast week, the Cut alerted us to the fact that now is the best time to stock up on cheap cashmere. And, certainly, in the case of Everlane, there are still quite a few of last season\u2019s cashmere sweaters lingering in their Choose What You Pay section \u2014 including this ivory-colored, oversize, slouchy (slightly rounded) V-neck sweater. Said one happy reviewer: It feels \u201clike I have my pajama top on \u2026 nice and comfortable.\u201d And another: \u201cEven though the fit is advertised as \u2018oversized,\u2019 I took a risk and still sized up for a really cozy oversized fit and it paid off \u2014 not sloppy, but just big enough I could pull it off with leggings if I wanted. The ivory is a great shade, the neckline is really nice.\u201d So there you have it.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
