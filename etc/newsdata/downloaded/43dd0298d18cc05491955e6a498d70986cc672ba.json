Tonight, the president now saying in front of the cameras that China should investigate Joe Biden, too. Today, the president made that suggestion as the first witness was being interviewed in the tonight, the president lashing out and late today, what text messages just out now reveal. What a top dip lope mat said about the president, Ukraine and that move to hold hundreds of millions in U.S. Military aid before then asking for a favor. ABC's chief white house correspondent Jonathan Karl leading us off. Reporter: Today, president trump asked yet another foreign country to investigate his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden. This time it was China. China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.

I find, once again, the president inviting another country to interfere in our presidential elections repugnant and a fundamental breach of his oath of office. So, let's get to Jon Karl, live with us from the white house tonight. And Jon, the president insists his political requests of Ukraine on the phone call and now China in public are totally appropriate. Reporter: David, the president isn't even denying the central allegation against him. He's just insisting that asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is entirely proper.
