US military spending at Scotland airport", "language": "en", "text": "Donald Trump is suspected of profiting from his presidency (file photo): Getty\n\nCongress is investigating Donald Trump over allegations the president may have profited from his presidency.\n\nThe probe follows revelations that US military funds were spent in the president\u2019s Turnberry golf course.\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is probing financial transactions at the property and nearby Glasgow Prestwick Airport.\n\nElijah Cummings, chair of the committee, has raised \u201dserious conflict of interest concerns\u201d over the spending.\n\nThe Democratic congressman wrote to Patrick Shanahan, then-acting Secretary of State for Defence, in June, over the allegations.\n\n\u201cTwo years before the 2016 election, President Trump spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and renovate the Turnberry golf course in Scotland,\u201d Mr Cummings wrote.\n\n\u201cTo date, the property has continued to suffer financial losses and has not turned a profit for the president of his companies.\n\n\u201cThe airport closest to the Trump Turnberry golf course \u2013 Glasgow Prestwick Airport \u2013 has been viewed as integral to the golf course\u2019s financial success, yet it too has lost millions of dollars every year since its purchase by the Scottish Government in 2013.\u201d\n\nMr Cummings said he was concerned over military spending at the golf course, which appeared to have \u201dincreased substantially since the election\u201d.\n\nIn the document Mr Cummings cited news reports, which alleged the airport had offered \u201ccut-price rooms for select passengers and crew\u201d and free rounds of golf at Turnberry.\n\nHis committee is demanding to see all financial documents held by the department of defence in relation to the property.\n\nThe panel has been investigating the matter since April, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cGiven the president\u2019s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions about the president\u2019s potential receipt of US or foreign government emoluments in violation of the US Constitution and raise other serious conflict of interest concerns,\u201d Mr Cummings said.\n\n\u201cIn order to fulfil its responsibilities under the Constitution, the committee is seeking information related to expenditures at both Prestwick Airport and the president\u2019s nearby Scotland golf resorts.\u201d\n\nThe department of defence has not co-operated with the committee\u2019s request, according to CNN.\n\nBut records from the Defence Logistics Agency reveal that the military spent $11m (\u00a38.9m) on fuel at Prestwick Airport, despite it being cheaper for the planes to refuel at US military bases.\n\n\u201cGlasgow Prestwick Airport is operated on a commercial basis and at arm\u2019s length from the Scottish Government, in compliance with European Union state aid rules,\u201d a Scottish Government spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cMinisters do not intervene in the commercial discussions at the airport.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\n\u201cThe senior management team at the airport has been tasked with all aspects of taking the airport forward, including building on existing revenue streams.\n\n\u201cGlasgow Prestwick Airport has handled military and private flights since the 1930s and it remains an important part of the airport\u2019s business\u201d.\n\nNews of the investigation emerged a day after Democrats requested documents about Mike Pence\u2019s stay at one of the president\u2019s properties in Ireland.\n\nThe vice president stayed at Mr Trump\u2019s Doonbeg resort during a recent trip to Ireland.\n\nThe property was located 181 miles from meetings he was scheduled to attend in Dublin with Irish officials.\n\nA series of letters the House Oversight Committee sent to the White House, the Trump Organisation, the vice president\u2019s office and the US secret service following the trip said the committee \u201cdoes not believe that US taxpayer funds should be used to personally enrich President Trump, his family, and his companies\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Congress is investigating Donald Trump over allegations the president may have profited from his presidency.The probe
