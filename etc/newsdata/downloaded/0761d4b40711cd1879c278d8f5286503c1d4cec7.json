But that's kind of what I had in mind.\n\n(Image: BBC / Guy Levy)\n\n\"I thought you know what, if I need to just have a bit of a bed day so I'm alright for the dress run on Friday and I'm alright for the show on Saturday, that was my main priority really.\"\n\nHe is due to perform a tango to George Ezra's Paradise with Amy on Saturday night.\n\nThe pairing have so far impressed the judges and earned high scores of 31 and 32 respectively. When scores were combined for week one and week two, they found themselves at the top of the leaderboard.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAsked if he suffers pre-show nerves, he said: \"I am pretty confident, but with Strictly, oh my goodness. I'm the one on the Saturday calming everyone down.\n\n\"And then before we go on, we'll run it through and I make silly mistakes and then I start shaking like a leaf.\n\n\"I go out there, the first four steps, I'm a mess, I'm looking around and there's nothing that can prepare you for the actual live. And then I just shake.\"\n\nTwo celebrities - Anneka Rice and James Cracknell - have left the series so far.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing airs on BBC One on Saturday at 6.40pm.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
