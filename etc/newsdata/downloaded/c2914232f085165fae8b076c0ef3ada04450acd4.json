The three militaries are practicing how to work with each other as well as how to best incorporate the strengths of each force.\n\nAnd that gives us a perfect chance to watch the highly mobile, flexible, and lethal Marine artilleryman at work.\n\nFor warfighting exercise Koolendong, the 3rd Battalion, 11 Marines brought out their \"Triple Sevens.\" These are M777 howitzers which fire 155 mm shells. An M777 is capable of sending a 103-pound shell to a target almost 14 miles away and of hitting that target within 54 yards thanks to a GPS-guided fuze.\n\nAn extended-range version of the round can go almost 23 miles at maximum range.\n\nBut of course, the rounds and the howitzers are only as good as the artillerymen manning them, and the Marines in the video above prove themselves quite capable of using their weapon to maximum effect.\n\nUS Marines fire an M777 howitzer during Exercise Koolendong at Mount Bundey Training Area, Northern Territory, Australia, August 27, 2019.

And if artillery is king of the battle, the M777 is a roided-out king who could wrestle a lion.\n\nThere's a Marine who ferries ammunition from the truck or ammo supply point to the weapon, which requires a quick movement of dozens of yards while carrying over 100 pounds every time he does it.\n\nUS Marines fire an M777 howitzer during Exercise Koolendong at Mount Bundey Training Area, Northern Territory, Australia, August 27, 2019.

Nicholas Filca\n\nThere are two Marines who work together to ram the round from its staged position into the breech, something that is accomplished with a massive, heavy tool that they sprint against.\n\nThere's the gunner who's trying to make sure his weapon is perfectly aimed after each shot, even though it settles into the dirt differently after every firing. The tiniest mistake in his measurements could send the round hundreds of yards off target.\n\nAnd while the crew is firing at its sustained rate, of two rounds per minute, it can be tough. But their max firing rate is five rounds per minute, meaning that they have to repeat their physically and mentally challenging jobs every twelve seconds without fail.
