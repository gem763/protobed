A crime against our own children.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised Hallam wants to try other methods to bring attention to this element of our governments suicidal policies.\n\nOn Thursday, Hallam and several others \u2013 people I call friends, were pre-emptively arrested before taking part in a collective act of nonviolent civil disobedience.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This was a proposal that offered zero risk to public health and safety, but great legal risk for those involved.

I sent a text to my housemates with an advanced apology in case they showed up there, because we didn\u2019t know whose home they might go to next. I haven\u2019t been involved in organising the Heathrow Pause, but neither has one of the other people whose house was searched. I don\u2019t think there are many cases of pre-arrest for peaceful activists ahead of an action in the UK.\n\nIn spite of the fact that preemptive policing and arrests might sound like a frightening legal precedent, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the most alarming aspect about what happened on Thursday. I\u2019m not surprised that they came for Hallam, who had been to tell the police what he planned to do, and when and where the protest groups would do it. The police, apparently, were clear at that meeting that if action was going to proceed, they would make pre-arrests. But what I am most worried about is the fact that they arrested support team members. Live streamers with their mobile phones ready. One person who has just helped Roger with some of his admin in recent months, and perhaps most worryingly, their press coordinator. He was involved simply to liaise with the media and make sure they get news coverage.\n\nAnd Dr Larch Maxey, my friend, was not resisting arrest when he was bitten on both legs by a police dog in his back garden. It was 24 hours later on his release that he was provided with full medical attention, a tetanus vaccination and a course of antibiotics.\n\nSeveral protestors in the last couple of days have managed to get their drones in the air and turn themselves in to the police but the airport has been unaffected. This only serves to prove that there is no risk to safety, otherwise surely the airport would have been closed down, at least for some hours. The authorities can\u2019t have it both ways, can they?\n\nI understand why those involved in this group feel they need to act with absolute urgency and courage. While writing this on Saturday I received the news that Hallam had returned to Heathrow, breaking his bail terms, which forbid him to go within 5 miles of an airport or carry any drone equipment. He had been re-arrested after attempting to fly a drone again.\n\nIn the last few days in our country, peaceful campaigners have been taken from their homes and locked up. This is chilling, but there has been an outpouring of emotion and support for them. The love, solidarity, and empathy can already be felt from Amsterdam, from Delhi, from New York as well as from their own neighbours. Their steadfastness, and morality through their actions is a demonstration of ethics and a commitment to a liveable future in the age of climate breakdown.\n\nPreemptively arresting peaceful people achieves what, exactly? Nothing. Not only that, but it is far from what\u2019s needed right now. What is more urgent, is the need for policing to steer away from the worrying path it\u2019s heading down.\n\nClare Farrell is co-founder extinction rebellion", "description": "Last summer, I went on hunger strike with Extinction Rebellion co-founder Roger Hallam and others for two weeks to protest the expansion of Heathrow Airport; hardly anyone noticed us.
