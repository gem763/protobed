The 10980XE has the lowest base speed, at 3GHz, but it has the highest number of cores at 18, and the largest L3 cache with 24.75MB in total.\n\nAt the other end of the Core-X spectrum, the Core i9-10900X has the highest base frequency at 3.7GHz, but has almost half the number of cores by comparison with 10, and has 19.25MB of cache.\n\nThe other two chips, the 10940X and 10920X, have 14 and 12 cores operating at 3.3GHz and 3.5GHz respectively, alongside 19.25MB of cache.\n\nAlongside the new chips, Intel has halved the price of its top-of-the-line Core i9 processors. Last year's top 9980XE model had hit the market with a price of $1,980, but this year, the price of the 10980XE will be $980.\n\nFor the other new chips, the 10940X will cost $785, the 10920X is $690, and the 10900X is $590.\n\nCascade Lake chips are built on the older Skylake 14nm manufacturing process, which the chip giant recently moved beyond with its Ice Lake launch.\n\nIn May, AMD announced its third-generation Ryzen processors built on 7nm technology.\n\nTopping the range is the Ryzen 9 3900X, which is set to cost $500, packs 12 cores, has a 2.8GHz base frequency with 4.6GHz boost, and has 70MB of cache.\n\n\"That's half the price of our competition with much, much more performance,\" AMD CEO Dr Lisa Su said at the time.\n\nLast week, Intel published a research paper on a new type of memory that would be safe against speculative execution side-channel attacks, such as Meltdown, Spectre, L1TF, SGXSpectre, SWAPGSAttack, Zombieload, MDS, and others.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nIntel proposes new SAPM memory type to protect against Spectre-like attacks\n\nNew CPU memory type proposed.
