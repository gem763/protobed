Analysts said the inquiry is a potential drag for stocks, though the potential may be limited barring an indication that support for Trump is slipping in the Republican-controlled Senate. A vote by the House to impeach would be followed by a trial in the Senate, which would decide the president's fate.\n\nRead:Why Trump impeachment threat is rattling stock-market investors -- at least for now (link)\n\n\"Given how this increases the prospect of heightened political uncertainty in the world's largest economy and compounds the list of geopolitical factors, risk assets and global equities in particular remain in the firing line,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM, in a note.\n\nAnalysts questioned, however, whether the impeachment cloud would have a lasting effect on stocks.\n\nSee:How Pelosi's impeachment inquiry into Trump could be a plus for one stock sector (link)\n\n\"We would note that this is only a small step on the road to impeachment, which would ultimately require a 2/3 majority in the Republican-controlled Senate and that it is not clear yet whether the House will vote to endorse the inquiry, so leading to charges against Trump,\" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.\n\nOther factors were also blamed for Tuesday's market weakness, including continued uncertainty around U.S.-China trade as well as some downbeat consumer-confidence data.\n\nWhich stocks are worth watching?\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc.
