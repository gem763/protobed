It\u2019s now a criminal probe, and Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham are working to figure out how the country became engulfed in the collusion hysteria. For over two years, Democrats and their allies in the liberal media peddled the Trump-Russia collusion myth. It was a total hoax. And the basis for all of this rests with the debunked Trump dossier that was compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele after being contracted by the research firm Fusion GPS. And who hired Fusion to quarterback this wild goose chase? That would be the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrats. This unverified piece of political opposition research was viewed as credible evidence in securing a FISA spy warrant against former Trump campaign official Carter Page.\n\nSince then, the FBI\u2019s reputation as a professional and impartial investigative law enforcement body has taken a hit. Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, bureau lawyer Lisa Page, were the focal point in the deep state antics that have been alleged throughout the Trump administration\u2019s first term. The two exchanged tens of thousands of texts. All were anti-Trump. Strzok texted about how this little crew would \u201cstop\u201d a Trump presidency and referenced an insurance policy, which many have alleged is the Trump dossier. Strzok was a key person in both the counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign and the FBI\u2019s analysis of the Hillary Clinton email server. This deserves all the scrutiny, especially after it turned out to be a huge nothing burger.\n\nJames Comey, the former FBI director, was fired for giving sensitive documents relating to his meetings with Trump to a friend with the intention of leaking them to the press in order to get a special counsel investigation going. And that\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nThe upper crust of the FBI was damaging the institution with its anti-Trump activities. It\u2019s funny. This is what these clowns think is necessary to save\u2026our institutions? With Comey and Strzok handed pink slips, and Page having resigned, Attorney General Barr decided to give props to the bureau now that the cancer has been excised. And by cancer, I mean James Comey (via Fox News):\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr, in an interview with Fox News, defended the independence and integrity of the politically contentious probe being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the handling of the Russia investigation \u2013 while taking a swipe at James Comey\u2019s past leadership of the FBI. Fox News reported last week that the probe into the 2016 origins of the Russia meddling case has escalated from a review to a criminal investigation, a development that spurred Democratic claims that the department was becoming a tool for President Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical revenge.\u201d Barr, speaking Monday to Fox News on the sidelines of a law enforcement event in Chicago, rejected Democrats\u2019 claims he is acting as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. \"That's completely wrong and there is no basis for it, and I act on behalf of the United States,\" Barr said. The attorney general said that while he\u2019s assisting in connecting Durham with countries that could have valuable information, Durham is running the show. \u201cHe is in charge of the investigation, I\u2019m not doing the investigation,\u201d Barr said, while describing Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, as \u201cthorough and fair\u201d and saying he\u2019s making progress. Further, Barr took an implicit swipe at Comey as he maintained current FBI Director Christopher Wray is cooperating. \u201cI do want to say that one of the reasons Mr. Durham is able to make the kind of progress he\u2019s making is because Director Wray and his team at the FBI have just been outstanding in support and responsiveness given to Mr. Durham,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve said previously that I felt there was a failure of leadership at the bureau in 2016 and part of 2017, but since Director Wray and his team have taken over there\u2019s been a world of change. I think that he is restoring the steady professionalism that\u2019s been a hallmark of the FBI. I really appreciate his leadership there.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a very professional knifing, but also a nice hat tip to current FBI Director Chris Wray. As many already know, the FBI is also the go-to agency for domestic surveillance and intelligence. It has the power to ruin people, and the Trump White House and those in its orbit have been targeted in the past. Trump aside, you cannot have the nation\u2019s preeminent law enforcement agency behaving like Democratic operatives\u2014and that can be applied to other institutions that are supposed to be apolitical. Enforcing the law and national security, two areas where this principle should be exhibited, have become a huge problem concerning the Trump White House.", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:15:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/355/72e025ae-19d4-4007-886f-9044f6089bb1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
