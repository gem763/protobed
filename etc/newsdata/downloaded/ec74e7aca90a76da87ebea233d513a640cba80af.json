Trump reimposed a near-total embargo on the Iranian economy last year and endorsed a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign to isolate Iran\u2019s leadership and force it to negotiate a stricter bargain.\n\nThe administration wants Iran to give up its ballistic missile program and agree to more stringent restrictions on its nuclear program. Iran has responded by restarting some nuclear activities prohibited under the agreement, a strategy some analysts say is aimed at building leverage ahead of any potential talks.\n\nTehran\u2019s envoy to the United Nations, however, said Bolton\u2019s removal would not change Iran\u2019s opposition to negotiations with the United States as long as economic sanctions are in place. His comments were carried by official media Wednesday.\n\n\n\nJohn Bolton, then national security adviser, speaks during a graduation ceremony at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., May 22, 2019.
