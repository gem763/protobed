Now we know what it was all for: a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! The West Coast host set up shop in Brooklyn last week, got a visit from Kanye, and aired this performance the next night. Kanye and his Sunday Service choir sang \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d from Jesus Is King at the famously always-open Oculus. Like, so open that people were just walking by, trying to catch a train, while they filmed at 3 a.m. With lyrics like \u201cClosed on Sunday / You my Chick-fil-A,\u201d these commuters probably thought some sort of fried-chicken commercial was being filmed. All this free promo and Chick-fil-A is still gonna be quaking when the Popeyes chicken sandwich comes back.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch Kanye West perform his new song \u201cClosed on Sundays\u201d from \u201cJesus Is King\u201d on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-kanye-west-oculus.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
