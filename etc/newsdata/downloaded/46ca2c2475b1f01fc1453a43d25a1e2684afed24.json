In Thuringia, he overtook Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives to come second in an election on Sunday.\n\nHaldenwang said individuals belonging to the \"new right\" were becoming politically active with the aim of making right-wing radical thinking, even extremist thinking, acceptable.\n\n\"Bridgeheads are established in the media and attention-grabbing forms of protest are carried out to find resonance,\" he said, adding that ideologies often included anti-pluristic tendencies.\n\nHaldenwang reiterated his agency's estimates that around half of the roughly 24,100 \"right wing extremists\" in Germany were potentially violent.\n\nHe also highlighted the increasing danger from attackers who are radicalized on the Internet and act alone and compared the Halle attacker to those in Oslo and Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n\"Investigations so far indicate that the perpetrator had not shared his plan for the anti-Semitically motivated attack in Halle with anyone at all up until the moment he carried it out,\" said Haldenwang.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Madeline Chambers and Sabine Siebold, Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "description": "The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency said on Tuesday that militant right-wingers were mixing with less radical conservatives, blurring the lines to make extremism more acceptable and harder to detect.
