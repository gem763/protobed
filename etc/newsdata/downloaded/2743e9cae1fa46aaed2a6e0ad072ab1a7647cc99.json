What happened was that the judges hearing the case recognised the matter was of such overriding importance to us all that it needed to be referred directly to the Supreme Court, and with the utmost speed. Had the case had no merit, I would not have been given leave of appeal \u2013 or had the rare privilege of the case \u201cleapfrogging\u201d so rapidly to the UK\u2019s ultimate judicial court.\n\nIt has also been reported that the judgment will take place on Tuesday. Also untrue. The case will certainly be heard on Tuesday, but it may be several days \u2013 possibly even longer \u2013 before the judgment is handed down.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nTo say the case is important, however, is an understatement. The balance of power between us, as voters, and the executive, whom we elect to govern us, could be altered irredeemably by the case\u2019s outcome.\n\nOne thing is for certain: Johnson is not attempting to empower any of us. Imperilling our constitutional settlement and emasculating our representative democracy are, however, very much on the cards.\n\nSay Boris Johnson \u2013 or one of his prime ministerial successors \u2013 decides to bring back the poll tax, re-introduce Section 28 or put the death penalty back on the statute book. There would be an outcry, of course \u2013 but it could be done easily enough if Johnson is now permitted to get his way.\n\nProroguing parliament is, if we don\u2019t look out, the prime minister\u2019s right to do whatever he so wishes, no matter how fierce or strong the opposition to it may be.\n\nWhat we are witnessing is an historic attempt at a power grab by the executive, from the people. Johnson, as prime minister, wants to put himself above the law. He wants to dispense with the constitutional checks and balances, accrued over centuries, that have evolved our parliamentary system into the stable, carefully calibrated machine that it is today \u2013 and one respected by the British public and admired around the world for its constancy and reliability.\n\nJohnson wants to do nothing less than to up-end the entire constitutional edifice in order that the executive should get its own way, and in the face of elected MPs\u2019 serious public policy concerns. This is not only irresponsible. It is also profoundly un-conservative.\n\nThis is why people on all sides of the political spectrum \u2013 no matter how they voted in the EU referendum \u2013 are uniting against it. It is why MPs shouted so loudly the word \u201cshame\u201d as the formal process of proroguing parliament began last week.\n\nAny prime minister before Johnson could have attempted to do this given that our constitution has always borne the vulnerability of not being written down. But, thankfully, no one had ever before been quite so cavalier or calculating about how our parliamentary democracy could be procedurally manipulated in order to achieve the executive\u2019s desired public policy outcome.\n\nThe Queen of course has always observed the constitutional proprieties to the full. They lie at the heart of what has made this such a long, stable and successful reign. But, those same conventions and proprieties appear to mean nothing to Johnson.\n\nIn the High Court earlier this month, my excellent legal team under Lord Pannick had a single day in court to put their arguments. Time may not have been on our side, but the law and truth was, and, even when our arguments were honed down to little more than bullet points, they were still compelling.\n\nCalmly and reasonably, Lord Pannick, whom I had the privilege to be represented by in my successful legal challenge to Theresa May\u2019s government over its attempt to over-rule parliamentary sovereignty, spelt out the law.\n\nSo far from being involved with political issues, the case he laid out against prorogation had three principal strands. Firstly, prorogation has never been longer than three weeks for the last 40 years; secondly, the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen was an \u201cabuse of power\u201d; and lastly, the breach of parliamentary sovereignty is happening during a period where \u201ctime is very much of the essence\u201d, that is, ahead of the Brexit deadline on 31 October.\n\nThe case put forward by Johnson\u2019s lawyers seemed by contrast to be more about political soundbites than an attempt to engage constructively. All the way through this whole national ordeal, this has been about the emotions of the few at the expense of the majority.\n\nThe judges, meanwhile, have to ask themselves one simple question: is what Johnson is doing reasonable?\n\nGina Miller is a transparency campaigner and businesswoman.
