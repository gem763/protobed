In fact, she said she was trying to figure out what it was,\u2019 Indiana State Police Detective Michelle Jumper said.\n\n\u2018She knows she dimmed her lights for it because it had headlights, but she couldn\u2019t make out what it was.\u2019\n\n\u2018By the time she realized what it was, the kids were right there in front of her.\u2019\n\nShepherd (pictured) leaving the Fulton County courthouse after initial court appearance in November of 2018\n\nFulton County Prosecutor Michael Marris said in his closing arguments that the bus stop had been there for 50 years and never had a fatality before Shepherd\u2019s accident.\n\nHe also reminded jury that the driver behind Shepherd saw the warning sign and was able to tell there was a school bus ahead.\n\n\u2018The thing that makes me sick here,\u2019 Marrs said, \u2018is that this never should have happened.\u2019\n\nShepherd could face up to 21 and a half years in prison, depending on her decided sentence.\n\nHer sentencing is scheduled for December 18.\n\nBrittany Ingle, the mother of the three siblings (pictured), said: 'I don't think we'll ever feel closure, but this will go toward healing'\n\nNeither Shepherd nor her attorneys had any comments while leaving the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the parents of the children told reporters after the trial that they had no sympathy for Shepherd\u2019s verdict.\n\nBrittany Ingle, mother of the three siblings, implied the damage had already been done.\n\nShe said: \u2018I don't think we'll ever feel closure, but this will go toward healing.\u2019\n\nOn October 30, 2018, Shepherd was driving her Toyota Tacoma with three children in the backseat prior to the crash.\n\nShe had just dropped her husband, Neil Shepherd, off to work at 7.05am and was driving her younger brother to her mother\u2019s house.\n\nShe rounded onto Ind. 25, a road she frequented often but rarely at that time of day.\n\nPictured: a map showing the location of the children's homes, the waiting school bus and Shepherd's car at the time of the accident\n\nAccording to her attorney, Shepherd couldn\u2019t make out the vehicle ahead of her and confused a freightliner driving behind the bus as one large vehicle.\n\n\u2018The circumstances of the bus, with the freightliner behind it, combined to create the profile of one vehicle, making it seem like it's a semi that's moving. And she's confused about what she sees,\u2019 he said.\n\nUp the road, the four school children were preparing to cross the two-lane highway to get to their morning school bus.\n\nXzavier, Mason, Alivia and Maverik were walking out of their housing complex around the same time as Shepherd was driving down the street.\n\nThe school bus was waiting on the side of the road with the warning sign blinking, signalling cars to stop in both directions to let children pass.\n\nPictured: Emergency services at the scene of the accident after the four children were struck by Shepherd\n\nUnfortunately, Shepherd reportedly never saw that sign.\n\nA witness said she watched the horrific scene unfold, hoping Shepherd would slow down from her 45mph cruise.\n\nThe \u2018distraught\u2019 bus driver, who also witnessed the incident, reportedly blasted his horn to get Shepherd\u2019s attention seconds before impact.\n\nAfterwards, Shepherd reportedly stopped her vehicle and asked a nearby witness what happened.\n\nShe said: \u2018What did I hit?\u2019\n\n\u2018You just ran over kids. You probably killed them all,\u2019 the man answered.\n\nUltimately, the four victims were struck by Shepherd\u2019s vehicle to dire results.\n\nLowe, who was thrown 30 feet from the collision and was hospitalized, was left in critical condition.\n\nThe young boy was forced to undergo several surgeries, according to a GoFundMe page created to cover medical expenses.\n\nLowe suffered broken ribs, a busted knee cap, fractures in his arms and wrist, and his legs were held being held together by rods.\n\nHe also had slipped disks in his spine by his neck.\n\nAfter the accident, the local school district supervisor announced the bus stop would be moved from across the street and into the mobile park home of the victims.", "description": "Alyssa Shepherd, 24, was convicted on three counts of reckless homicide after running her pickup truck into four school children walking to the school bus - killing three siblings and critically injuring another", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/14/19923430-0-image-a-2_1571490114101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
