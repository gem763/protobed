The country hotel and non-profit art foundation is the creation of Lena Evstafieva, a former art consultant, and her musician husband J\u00e9r\u00f4me Hadey.\n\nThe couple transformed the derelict estate into a creative haven, converting farm buildings into 14 perfectly rustic-but-chic loft apartments. \u201cThe beauty of it is being able to connect with nature as well as the resident artists,\u201d says Evstafieva. \u201cYou can be as social or isolated as you want.\u201d Since its opening the place has drawn many artists, offering a sanctuary in exchange for work exhibited on the walls of the hotel.\n\nThe place has its own rhythm and every day there is something different to try: creative workshops from Italian cocktail- making to cooking and wine-tasting classes, foraging and truffle-hunting with the resident dogs, candlelit concerts and storytelling. Everywhere you wander, there is someone painting or playing a musical instrument.\n\n\u2022 A one-night, half-board stay from \u00a370; \u00a3123 for two nights, villa-lena.it\n\nBritt Collins\n\nPhotography: Morocco\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Through the lens \u2026 head into the Sahara with a camera\n\nSnap your way through the souks of Marrakech or capture the dunes and Bedouin camel herders on a tour of the Sahara.
