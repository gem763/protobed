The team worked closely with the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, collaborating with the 27th Annual Art of Motion Picture Costume Design team and its engineers to shoot each costume and bring the AR experience to life for USA TODAY\u2019s audience.\n\nThe interactive Oscars experience quickly follows USA TODAY\u2019s first 2019 AR release in January, an experience featuring Washington Capitals defenseman John Carlson with audio narration by him discussing his career as a professional hockey player. The continuation with the release of the Oscars AR experience reflects the USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s commitment to experimenting with emerging technologies and immersive formats to engage audiences in new and different ways. More than a dozen emerging technology projects are currently in the pipeline for 2019.\n\n\u201cUnlike many other AR experiences, our goal wasn\u2019t to use AR to tell part of the story. Our AR experience is the story,\u201d said Ray Soto, Director of Emerging Tech, USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cNothing demands a more up close and personal look than the incredibly detailed and awe-inspiring designs of this year\u2019s Oscar costume nominees. With multiple layers of interactivity between the user and the costume designers, audiences can glean an almost one-on-one experience with the creators of their favorite costumes from these Oscar nominated films.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur access to the Oscar-nominated costumes and designers is what makes this such a one of a kind experience. Partnering with the emerging tech team has enabled us to truly bring the Oscars to life and into the hands of our readers.\u201d said Alison Maxwell, Managing Editor, USA TODAY Life. \u201cBetween the exclusive sound bites with the designers, user interactivity and detailed narration from our reporters, we\u2019re taking storytelling to the next level. I\u2019m excited to see how readers will respond.\u201d\n\nTo view the Oscars AR experience, download the latest version of the USA TODAY mobile app, and click to view on Android and iOS devices or find within the Life section.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/02/18/usa-today-launches-first-entertainment-augmented-reality-experience-ahead-oscars/2904442002/", "description": "USA TODAY today launched \u201cOscars AR: The costumes and creators,\u201d its first entertainment augmented reality (AR) experience ahead of the 91st Academy Awards.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
