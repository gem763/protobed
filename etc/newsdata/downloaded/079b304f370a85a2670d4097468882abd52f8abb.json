Best selling author Andy Griffiths spills his secrets\n\nWe chat to international best-selling author Andy Griffiths.\n\nInternational best-selling author Andy Griffiths is visiting South Africa!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet heard of him, it\u2019s probably because you don\u2019t have a tween at home. Griffiths is the author of the extremely popular Treehouse series aimed at 9 \u2013 12 year-olds.\n\nHe\u2019s visiting various schools in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg and doing public events with Exclusive Books this September: if you'd like to meet him, find his schedule below.\n\nParent24 got a chance to ask him some questions and learn more about him and his process:\n\nWhat inspired you to write for children?\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve always loved reading and writing, ever since I was young, and I\u2019ve always enjoyed making up outlandish stories and trying to get people to believe them.\n\nI was inspired to become a children\u2019s author, because in the 1990s I was an English high school teacher and I was shocked to find that my students did not like reading (or writing).\n\nI wanted them to see how much fun both these things could be so I started writing little stories to amuse them, and encouraged them to write their own stories to amuse one another.\n\nWhere/how do you find your stories?\n\nI\u2019ve never had trouble coming up with ideas for stories. I find I get ideas all the time, from all over the place\u2014from books or newspaper articles I read, TV shows and movies I watch, conversations I have.\n\nI tend to get ideas as I am writing as well, so while I\u2019m working on one story this can trigger an idea about something that could happen in the next story.\n\nI think Ray Bradbury expresses how the creative process works in this quote: \"If you stuff yourself full of poems, essays, plays, stories, novels, films, comic strips, magazines, music, you automatically explode every morning like Old Faithful. I have never had a dry spell in my life, mainly because I feed myself well, to the point of bursting. I wake early and hear my morning voices leaping around in my head like jumping beans. I get out of bed to trap them before they escape.\"\n\nFind beautiful local bedtime stories for children in Parent24's Storytime hub\n\nWhy is it so important for children to choose what they want to read?\n\nThis just seems like common sense to me. If children choose what to read then presumably they will want to read it.\n\nMy daughter was not particularly interested in reading fiction when she was young and you could see it was just an unpleasant chore for her to read for 30 minutes a day, which was her prescribed homework. So we took her to the library and let her choose her own books.\n\nShe mostly chose non-fiction books on animals and then she would discover so many interesting and amazing facts that she would spontaneously read them aloud to the rest of the family.\n\nOne tip for parents to encourage a love of reading in their kids?\n\nRead to them \u2014 and with them \u2014 a lot! Many parents have told me how much they enjoy reading, laughing and talking about the Treehouse books as a family.\n\nSometimes this experience is achieved by listening to the audio books on long car drives. The children not only learn to associate books with the fun of a shared imaginative adventure but also with the closeness and warmth of family.\n\nI have heard, however, that sometimes the parents get upset when their children read ahead of them \u2026 but that is a GREAT problem to have!\n\nLearn amazing facts about our world with Parent24's Curious Minds story hub\n\nWhy is humour in kids\u2019 books important?\n\nKids respond to humour. They are naturally playful with words and ideas. If you want a sure way to engage children, especially reluctant readers, then humour is necessary.\n\nHumour fosters friendship and social interaction between readers. For example, if a reader tells another person about something funny that happened in a book and this makes the person laugh, then the reader sort of gets the credit for causing the laughter (not the author) and this shared laughter creates a bond between the reader and the person they have made laugh.\n\nStudies show that when kids tell each other about funny books they tend to give specific examples of humorous events rather than describe the plot or say what the book is about, which is what they do when describing a serious book to someone else.\n\nThis is a quote from a letter I received last week from a reader: \u201cAt the beginning of the year I didn\u2019t really like to read chapter books. My friend, Harry, was reading your book, The 39-Storey Treehouse and was laughing while he was reading it. Then Harry suggested I might like to read it too. So I did. I am now hooked on your Treehouse books.\u201d\n\nAnd humour helps children to cope when life is not fun. I also receive letters in which readers (or their parents) tell me how the books provide a safe space, a refuge from bullying, social isolation and sadness.\n\n\n\nWhat do kids find funny, in books?\n\nWord play, silliness, over-the-top violence and fighting, stupidity, underpants, nonsense, illogicality and surprising things that could never happen in real life but which you, nevertheless, kinda sorta believe actually do.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Saturday 14 September, 11 am at Exclusive Books Tygervally, Cape Town\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Sunday 15 September, 11 am at Exclusive Books Cavendish, Cape Town\n\n\u00b7 Saturday 21 September, 11 am at Exclusive Books Sandton, Johannesburg\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
