The other is a story of a family working with what they had, seeking opportunity amid the deep forces of segregation, wealth inequality, and public underinvestment.\n\nWilliams-Bolar did not mean to become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre any more than Huffman; she did not even realize she was doing anything wrong at the time. Having divorced her abusive spouse, she was attending the University of Akron, working as a teacher\u2019s aide, and raising her daughters, Kayla and Jada. She wanted to become a teacher, as well as a homeowner, she told me, and she wanted to raise her daughters in better circumstances than she grew up in.\n\nThat meant seeking better options than the low-performing Akron public schools her daughters were attending. At one of them, the \u201cceiling [was] falling in,\u201d she said: extensive water damage, mold, old and outdated textbooks, overworked teachers, unruly classrooms. Her kids were struggling. \u201cMy girls were very mild \u2014 especially my youngest one, she was a tiny little thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my girls started getting bullied, I said no.\u201d\n\nWilliams-Bolar\u2019s father, Edward Williams, who lived nearby, spent ample time taking care of the girls. Williams-Bolar split time between the two homes herself \u2014 especially after her house was burglarized. The family decided to enroll the girls in school using his address in the nearby Copley-Fairlawn school district, which met all of Ohio\u2019s 26 educational standards, whereas the Akron schools met only four. \u201cThe bullying helped push me over the edge to say, \u2018Well, my dad can take care of them. He can see that they get off and on the bus safely. He can watch them while I\u2019m in college,\u2019\u201d Williams-Bolar told me.\n\nShe loved that in the suburbs the girls were going to classrooms with far more resources. \u201cThat school out in Copley \u2014 they had acres of land. They had greenhouses! They had an experience that inner-city kids would never understand, you see,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was so fabulous \u2014 science and everything else too. But the science was what took me overboard. I was like: Look at this! They\u2019ve got a greenhouse and it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d\n\nWhat the Williams-Bolar family engaged in is called \u201cboundary hopping\u201d or \u201cdistrict hopping\u201d \u2014 or, when it gets caught in the legal system, \u201cresidency fraud\u201d or \u201cenrollment fraud.\u201d There are no hard numbers on how common it is, but it is very, very common, educational experts believe, particularly where high-achieving and low-achieving school districts abut one another and where inequality is acute. One survey of public schools in Berkeley, California, for instance, suggested that 8 to 12 percent of enrolled students lived out-of-bounds.\n\nWhat is uncommon is for parents to be charged with a felony for engaging in the practice, rather than having their children unenrolled or being fined or, perhaps most likely, the school district looking the other way. After her kids started in the Copley-Fairlawn schools, Williams-Bolar noticed someone following her and worried she was being stalked. She started carrying mace. That \u201cstalker\u201d was a private investigator hired by the school district to prove that Williams-Bolar\u2019s girls were out-of-bounds.", "description": "Kelley Williams-Bolar, like the Desperate Housewives star, was sentenced to jail time for trying to get her kid a better education.", "authors": ["Annie Lowrey", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/shutterstock_420021745/facebook.jpg?1568387213", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
