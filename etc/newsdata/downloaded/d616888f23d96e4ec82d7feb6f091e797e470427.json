The claims refer to video footage from Project Veritas, where a whistleblower alleges that coverage is influenced by Zucker\u2019s purported bias against the president.\n\n\u201cNever in the history of this country has a president been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called \u2018mainstream\u2019 news, as the current situation,\u201d Charles Harder wrote in his letter.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney claims CNN\u2019s actions violate the Lanham Act, which provides for a system of trademark protection because they are misrepresenting their coverage to the public and advertisers (specifically referencing CNN\u2019s claims that it is \u201cthe most trusted source in news\u201d).\n\nThe letter notes that Trump intends to file legal action against CNN, and will seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, reimbursement of legal costs and injunctive relief.\n\nA spokesperson for CNN called the threat \"nothing more than a desperate PR stunt\" that \"doesn't merit a response.\"\n\nThe move could spell more trouble for AT&T, which acquired CNN\u2019s parent company Time Warner for $85 billion in June of last year. AT&T is currently negotiating with activist investors who are pushing for change amid lackluster performance.\n\nDuring a rally in Dallas on Thursday night, the president went after \u201cfake news\u201d media. He specifically called out CNN for saying Texas was \u201cin play\u201d during the 2016 election, a state that Trump won. He also went after the network for comments it made to former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden \u2013 amid the president\u2019s criticisms of his business dealings in Ukraine while his father was in office.\n\nHarder has served as lead counsel on previous cases for both the president and the first lady. He has also represented a number of other high-profile celebrities, including actors Bradley Cooper and Jude Law, as well as actresses Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Bullock.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Trump's attorneys sent a letter to the network and its president this week.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Trump-Rally-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
