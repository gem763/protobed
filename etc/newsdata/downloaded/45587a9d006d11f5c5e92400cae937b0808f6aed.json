Laser devices generate an energized beam of light of a single color, or frequency. Green and blue beams can penetrate water with relative ease.\n\n\u201cChen\u2019s team also developed a highly sensitive detector that can pick up a single photon reflected from a target, allowing the device to detect bright objects close to the surface as well as targets hidden in the deep.\u201d\n\nA team at the Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics say they have devised a magnetic detection sensor that can fit into a capsule the size of a bean. \u201cThe device can pick up signals as weak as 20 femtotesla, or about one-fifth the strength of the magnetic field generated by a human brain,\u201d explained the South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201cAlthough other devices known as magnetic anomaly detectors are much more sensitive, they are bulkier and can only be mounted on planes or helicopters,\u201d the Post added. \u201cMagnetic anomaly detectors used in anti-submarine warfare must operate at temperatures near absolute zero and require lasers, power supplies and gas chambers to achieve high sensitivity.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Chinese scientists said they were developing a laser-equipped satellite that could detect submarines. The idea is to use laser beams of various colors that can detect disturbances in the water caused by a moving submarine.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Scientists at a Chinese research institute say they developed an airborne laser that might eventually detect hostile subs even at great depths.
