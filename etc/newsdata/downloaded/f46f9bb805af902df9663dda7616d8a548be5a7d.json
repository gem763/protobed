The hearing was entitled \u201cPresidential Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of Power.\u201d\n\nA defiant Corey Lewandowski gave Committee chair Jerry Nadler and the rest of the Democratic members of the committee the respect they deserved \u2013 that is to say, very little. He asked for statements to be repeated, for a copy of the report and he refused to answer many their questions. In fact, he behaved a bit like Robert Mueller had during his testimony in July.\n\nThe hearing quickly took on a circus-like feel leading several Democrats, including Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) to threaten to hold Lewandowski in contempt, claiming he was trying to obstruct their investigation. Cicilline told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to stonewall me and my questioning!\u201d And a very frustrated Nadler called Lewandowski\u2019s behavior \u201cunacceptable\u201d and is said to be considering holding him in contempt. He must have felt very powerless today.\n\nNadler had subpoenaed three witnesses including Rick Dearborn, Rob Porter, and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and aide, Corey Lewandowski. In his opening statement, Nadler said, \u201cUnfortunately, we learned last night that the White House is blocking the first two from even showing up, and tightly limiting the third. The White House has no authority, legal or otherwise, to give these orders.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that \u201cin at least five episodes, evidence laid out in the Special Counsel report established that all the elements of obstruction of justice were met.\u201d\n\nIf that were true, the Mueller team would have recommended charges.\n\nNadler said he would start with one of the most concerning ones. \u201cIt is the President ordering the Attorney General, through Mr. Lewandowski, to stop the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation into the president and his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe brief video below will give you an idea of the atmosphere inside the chamber.\n\nLewandowski\u2019s derisive demeanor antagonized the House Dems and made for some fiery exchanges. One of the more memorable of those came when Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) asked Lewandowski to read the words Trump had dictated to him on July 17, 2017. Lewandowski refused to read the words and, to the amusement of the Republicans in the room, repeatedly called him \u201cPresident Swalwell.\u201d That exchange can be viewed in the tweet below.\n\nEverything about this back and forth between Swalwell and Lewandowski is amazing but Lewandowski repeatedly calling him \"President Swalwell\" is *chef's kiss* pic.twitter.com/456pbDer2d \u2014 Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) September 17, 2019\n\nAnother tense exchange occurred between Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) and Lewandowski, who refused to answer her questions. He said, \u201cCould you repeat the question? I didn\u2019t hear it. Just a rant.\u201d Jackson-Lee scolded him, \u201cThis is a House Judiciary, not a house party.\u201d This can be watched in the tweet below.\n\n\u201cThis is a House Judiciary, not a house party,\u201d Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said in a heated exchange with Corey Lewandowski during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, after Lewandowski refused to answer a series of questions. https://t.co/IPOUV7ZxHg pic.twitter.com/DgduCzrDN8 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 17, 2019\n\nThe highlight of the day had to have been when Rep. Doug Campbell (R-GA) offered a sharp rebuke to Jerry Nadler for holding this sham of a hearing. Campbell said all you [Democrats] want to do is to put on a show to appease your base and lambasted them for not passing any legislation. Watch the clip in the tweet below.\n\nIn the absence of a proper floor vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, today\u2019s business represents a regular oversight hearing, masquerading as impeachment to appease a liberal base. pic.twitter.com/RfmPO2C4F6 \u2014 Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 17, 2019\n\nIt was a day of Democratic grandstanding and many of them ended the day looking like buffoons. Clearly they were playing to their liberal bases, but a top Democratic House Judiciary Committee source told NBC News Tuesday that there was another reason for the hearing. The source said \u201cthe point of the hearing had been to expose Trump to another possible pathway to impeachment: obstructing Congress by not fully complying with a subpoena.\u201d What a surprise.\n\nDuring a break in the testimony, Lewandowski sent out a tweet about his new website. He\u2019s contemplating a senate run.\n\nNew website just launched to help a potential senate run. Sign up now! https://t.co/WlI11PaQ7M \u2014 Corey R. Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) September 17, 2019\n\nFollowing his testimony, Lewandowski spoke to Fox News\u2019 Martha MacCallum.
