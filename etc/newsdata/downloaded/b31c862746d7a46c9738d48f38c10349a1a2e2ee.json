The company says it will host a conference call at 9 a.m. Eastern time Thursday.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share of C$0.05 and unadjusted earnings of C$0.06, according to Bloomberg. Aurora has said it expects positive fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for items such as biological asset transformation, among other things. But in the company\u2019s August guidance, it no longer stated that it expects positive Ebitda in the fourth quarter, only that it is \u201con track\u201d to hit the target in the future.\n\nRevenue: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Aurora to report revenue of C$108 million ($82.1 million) net of excise taxes, versus C$19.1 million in the year-ago period. Aurora reported fiscal third-quarter sales of C$65.1 million. In August, Aurora said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of between C$100 million and C$107 million.\n\nStock movement: In the past three months, Aurora stock ACB, +4.49% ACB, +4.30% has fallen 22.8%, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.03% has gained 3.2%\n\nOf the 17 analysts that cover Aurora, nine rate the company the equivalent of a buy rating, six have a hold and two rate the name a sell. The average target price is C$12.57, which represents nearly a 60% upside from Monday\u2019s closing price.\n\nWhat analysts are saying\n\nAurora\u2019s early-August revenue guidance came in below analysts\u2019 expectations for the fourth quarter, which GMP Securities analyst Ryan Macdonell believes stems from harvests arriving too late to be processed and sold during the fiscal fourth quarter. Macdonell also expects the company is holding back some inventory to prepare for the launch of edibles in Canada in December.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The $4 billion time bomb ticking away inside the biggest marijuana companies\n\nThe analyst wrote that Aurora previously hit the upper range of its revenue guidance and he expects the company to do the same for the fourth quarter. Macdonnell has a buy rating on the stock with a C$15 target price.\n\nCowen analyst Vivien Azer, who has a C$15 target price and rates the stock the equivalent of a buy, wrote in an August note to clients that she expects Aurora will report stronger-than-expected crop yields for its cannabis and a resulting improved cash cost per gram. In the note, Azer wrote that she expects the company to continue to progress to per-gram cash costs of lower than C$1.\n\n\u201cWe note that the revenue guide comes in below both our and Street estimates, although we do not consider this a significant surprise given the level of reported monthly retail sales coming from Statistics Canada. Given [Aurora\u2019s] strong production output, we would look for this to translate to strong revenue growth in [fiscal 2020], particularly as new product form factors come online in late-[second quarter] as well as continued brick and mortar rollout.\u201d\n\nAurora also recently sold its stake in Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. TGODF, -6.23% TGOD, -6.16%, which it acquired in 2018. Aurora Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley stepped down from Dutchman\u2019s board last fall. According to Seaport Global analyst Brett Hundley, the transaction generated C$86.5 million, which he said would pad Aurora\u2019s cash reserves as it \u201ccontinues to build out its cultivation and processing footprint.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Aurora\u2019s investments have generated significant swings in paper profits and losses, depending on market conditions during previous quarters.\n\nSee also: Canopy Growth\u2019s remaining CEO talks about pot company\u2019s shake-up, and the search for his replacement\n\nStifel analyst W. Andrew Carter initiated coverage of Aurora in June, setting a $10 price target and rating the stock a hold. Carter wrote in the initiation note that his team is taking a more \u201ccautious approach\u201d to the stock because of a less optimistic view of the global medical-use market outside of Germany and Canada \u2014 which Aurora is making a significant bet on \u2014 and difficulty the company faces expanding into the U.S.\n\nLike several of the largest cannabis producers in Canada, Aurora has also accumulated billions in goodwill on its balance sheet \u2014 the result of acquisitions leading up to federal legalization in Canada. Large goodwill impairment charges are one potential result of the accumulation.\n\nCarter called Aurora\u2019s expansion in the Canadian market \"expensive,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s acquisition of MedReleaf and CanniMed for a total of C$4.3 billion, most of which was paid for with the company\u2019s paper. Beyond the acquisitions, Carter\u2019s team estimates that Aurora will need to spend an additional C$300 million to C$400 million in capital expenditures to complete its Canada infrastructure investments. The significant cash demand will require \u201cconsistent open access to the capital markets,\u201d he said.", "description": "Aurora Cannabis Inc. is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday after the closing bell.
