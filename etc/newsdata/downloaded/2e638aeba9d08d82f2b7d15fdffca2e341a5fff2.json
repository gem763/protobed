Bernie Sanders became the first 2020 Democratic candidate to grace the new season of The View on Wednesday. And while he may have gotten a friendly reception from longtime supporter Joy Behar, the rest of the show\u2019s co-hosts treated him much more warily.\n\nThis was true not only for Whoopi Goldberg, who seemed to insult Sanders by touting Andrew Yang\u2019s universal basic income proposal, but especially for Meghan McCain, who pressed the candidate to explain how could get anything accomplished in Washington given his extremely progressive agenda.\n\nMcCain\u2019s questions came after Behar elicited a response from Sanders to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s apparent desire to see a \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrat face Trump next fall. \u201cI love Nancy, but she and I disagree on this issue,\u201d he said. When Sanders went on to say, \u201cI have conservative friends that I love and respect,\u201d McCain interrupted him to ask, \u201cAny in Congress or the Senate?\u201d\n\nAsked if he could \u201cname one\u201d sitting Republican he respects, Sanders came up with Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), who announced his retirement just last week. \u201cYour dad was somebody I worked with!\u201d Sanders added.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re dead!\u201d McCain shot back, referring to her father, the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). As Sanders started to praise former President George W. Bush, she again pushed him to name \u201canyone in office, if you were president, that you would work with on the other side.\u201d\n\nFinally, Sanders arrived at Lamar Alexander, the 79-year-old Republican senator from Tennessee. \u201cLamar is not a liar,\u201d he said. \u201cLamar is not a sexist, he\u2019s not a racist, he\u2019s not a homophobe. He\u2019s a conservative guy.\u201d\n\nSanders failed to mention that Lamar Alexander would not be in the Senate by the time he hypothetically took office as president. At the end of last year, Alexander announced that he will not be seeking re-election in 2020.", "description": "When Sanders brought up Meghan McCain\u2019s father as an example, she pointed out that he\u2019s \u201cdead.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567614126/190904-wilstein-bernie-mccain-tease_hr0xjs"}
