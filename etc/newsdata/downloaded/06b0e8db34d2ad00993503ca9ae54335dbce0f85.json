It's the best place,\" Mulvaney said in a press conference. The White House briefing was Mulvaney's first since taking on the acting chief of staff role at the turn of the year.\n\nThe U.S. is responsible for hosting next year's G-7 summit and Mr. Trump indicated at the most recent G-7 summit in France that he wanted to hold it at his own private club in Florida.\n\nThe president insisted he doesn't care about profiting from it, even as he advertised the features of Trump National Doral Miami.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nMr. Trump only listed Camp David as an alternative location for the 2020 G-7.
