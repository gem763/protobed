They have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades, taken a heavy toll on the economy and show little sign of letting up.\n\nThey have also posed the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nWong said he was the only person disqualified out of more than 1,100 candidates in district council elections set for November.\n\nSuch votes have previously attracted little fanfare and been dominated by pro-Beijing candidates. But a summer of unrest has infused a new significance in the poll and prompted a record number of candidates and voters to register.\n\nHong Kong's government said in a statement one candidate was deemed invalid because they fell foul of electoral laws prohibiting \"advocating or promoting 'self-determination'\". It did not identify Wong by name.\n\nWong has said he supported the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong's future but that he is against independence, according to a post on his Facebook page on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n'VERY GRIM'\n\nWong's disqualification followed another weekend of protests that descended into chaotic clashes with police.\n\nBlack-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs, while residents in the working-class district of Mongkok poured on to the streets to hurl abuse at police officers sent to subdue the protesters.\n\nEmbattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she expected the Asian financial hub to record negative economic growth this year, in part as a result of the unrest.\n\n\"Our current assessment is that the full year of 2019 will likely show negative growth, which means we won't be able to achieve the already revised down positive growth of 0-1%,\" Lam said. \"The situation is very grim\".\n\nLam's gloomy forecast came two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had fallen into recession and was unlikely to achieve any growth this year.\n\nA preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday was expected to show two successive quarters of contraction - the technical definition of a recession.\n\nBeijing-backed Lam said the government would unveil new measures to boost the economy once the unrest died down, without giving any details.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nTourist numbers have plummeted, with visitor numbers down nearly 50 percent in October, record declines in retail sales, rising unemployment and bankruptcies.
