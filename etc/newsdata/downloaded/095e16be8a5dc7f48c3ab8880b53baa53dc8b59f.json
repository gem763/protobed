The White House hopes to hire the communications guru as early as next week.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of candidates, both inside and outside the building and maybe from other agencies,\u201d added a Republican close to the White House.\n\nThe nascent plans come roughly a week after acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s startling press conference during which he answered questions off-the-cuff on the Ukraine scandal, giving Democrats new leads for their inquiry. His appearance was widely panned throughout the West Wing and among Trump\u2019s attorneys, even if some aides say Mulvaney is safe in his current job.\n\nThe White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Times first reported the two people under leading consideration.\n\nEither way, Mulvaney\u2019s appearance provided a jolt to the White House. Combined with pressure from outside groups and allies to develop a more coordinated strategy, the White House has settled on hiring a communications front man for impeachment.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham previewed the move Thursday after he returned from a lunch at the White House, where he said he spoke to Mulvaney about the impeachment strategy. Graham said Mulvaney promised him the White House was \u201cworking on getting a messaging team together.\u201d\n\nGraham added that he hoped they would follow the model of the Clinton White House\u2019s impeachment strategy, which involved establishing a separate war room to handle the political and communications tasks.\n\nThe Republican close to the White House derided the idea of a full war room as too retro but conceded the administration now sees the need for greater help.\n\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/56/17/646cf12447d69620a6dc848a3157/191025-pam-bondi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
