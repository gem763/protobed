I propose a new phrase for this sort of behavior: \u201ccorporate communism.\u201d\n\nNot only did the NBA force the general manager of the Houston Rockets to delete a tweet supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, but they also made him apologize to the communist regime.\n\nBlizzard, creators of World of Warcraft, banned one of its top players from a Hearthstone video game tournament for a year, and withdrew a prize of $10,000 that he had recently won. The player, Ng Wai Chung, lists Hong Kong as his hometown, and had broadcast a message of support for the protesters during an online stream.\n\nRemember American ideals like democracy, freedom of speech, the right to assembly, self-determination? It appears that some of America\u2019s largest companies have forgotten. They appear more loyal to China and its billions of consumers, not American values.\n\n\u201cCorporate communism\u201d is an apt term, describing both communist China\u2019s attempt to blend Marxist government with market economics, and western corporations\u2019 willingness to march to their tune.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have a penalty yet, but it should. Companies are caving in because they\u2019re scared of sacrificing huge profits in Chinese markets by falling foul of the country\u2019s communist censors.\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to stop this behavior \u2014 impose financial penalties on any American company that kowtows to Beijing. And the penalties have to be heavyhanded enough to matter \u2014 we\u2019ve seen how tech giants, for example, respond to fines from regulators: frequently, the obscenely wealthy companies simply consider them a minor cost of doing business.\n\nGlobalist free marketeers will of course be very upset at the prospect of such \u201cbig government\u201d interference. But the present crisis of American values in American corporations is a result of their ideology. By insisting on a hands-off approach to America\u2019s corporate sector, they have paved the way for a country that doesn\u2019t take a hands-off approach to get its way. It\u2019s a tug-of-war game, but only one side is playing.\n\nAmerica\u2019s values \u2014 freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, decentralized government, the second amendment \u2014 were created to maximize individual liberty and independence from the state. The fact that so much of American life revolves around the private sector and not the state is the product of that limited-government approach.\n\nBut what happens when the private sector, decides, on its own, to do the bidding of a tyrannical regime? Suddenly, Americans will find themselves governed, through the private sector, by China. Much like their speech is governed, through the tech companies, by far-left activists who have nothing but contempt for the first amendment. The free marketers might believe the argument that their globalist policies export America\u2019s freedom and culture to Beijing and the rest of the world, but in reality, the west is clearly importing the culture of oppressive communist regimes to our shores.\n\nThose who hope that some kind of \u201cinvisible hand\u201d will force America\u2019s companies to one day do the right thing haven\u2019t paid attention to the recent corporate-led assaults on free speech, democracy, and the second amendment. The sad fact is that very few American brands have the courage of South Park.\n\nSpeaking of South Park, if America imposes penalties on corporate communism, it should probably also hand out awards for corporate patriotism. Do Matt Stone and Trey Parker have Medals of Freedom yet?\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
