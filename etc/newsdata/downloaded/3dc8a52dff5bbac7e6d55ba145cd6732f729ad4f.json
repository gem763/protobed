It has not yet confirmed the exact launch date for any markets besides Korea.\n\nSamsung first unveiled the Galaxy Fold in February to much fanfare but was quickly forced to push back its initial late April launch date after a small number of reviewers reported that the screens on their devices had broken after just two days of use.\n\nRead more: Some reviewers say their $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Fold foldable smartphones are breaking after just two days of use\n\nSome reviewers discovered issues after removing a protective layer that wasn't designed to be removed; others found that the smartphone simply malfunctioned. Business Insider did not encounter any issues during its own review of the Galaxy Fold.\n\nA teardown of Samsung's Galaxy Fold demonstrated that the phone's design was extremely fragile, particularly the screen and the hinge. Rival Huawei, which is also planning to launch its own foldable phone, also criticised Samsung's folding phone design for being too fragile.\n\nSamsung recalled its review phones and delayed its release date indefinitely until it had resolved the screen issues.\n\nThe firm said in its Thursday statement: \"During the past several months, Samsung has been refining the Galaxy Fold to ensure it delivers the best possible experience. Not only we improved [sic] the Galaxy Fold's design and construction, but also took the time to rethink the entire consumer journey.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lisa Eadicicco had a sneak peek at the Galaxy Fold back in April, prior to the fixes. The Fold is 5G-enabled, and its design means it folds and unfolds a little like a book. When completely unfolded, the phone features a 7.3-inch inner display. Folded up, there's a separate 4.6-inch front display. It's powered by a 7-nanometer 64-bit processor and includes 12GB of RAM, 512GB of storage space, and a 4380mAh battery.\n\nWhile the exact date for the US market has not yet been released, one customer told Business Insider that they were informed by a customer support representative that it would launch there on September 27. This Samsung representative also said that the new phone will be sold exclusively through retail stores at first and will not be available to order through Samsung's website. Samsung declined to comment on this.", "description": "The company pushed back the phone's original April 26 launch date following reports from reviewers that the device's screen had broken.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cbeb12eb14bf413b7414d74-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
