The Federal Protective Service and the inspector general did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to believe it was a personal attack. \u2026 [The poster] just fell off the wall,\u201d Morabito said. The incident \u201cwas so disturbing to everybody here. It came out of left field \u2026 but we weren\u2019t able to say anything for sure until the investigation happened.\u201d\n\nThe incident was first reported by NBC News, which said staffers at the Education Department suspected the alleged vandalism was racially motivated. At the time, the department declined to comment on specifics because of the investigation. The agency said the employee was part of the diversity change agency program that trains employees to \u201cfoster more inclusive workplaces.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn agency-wide email sent after the incident came to light alerted employees to the episode and directed people with knowledge to contact security.\n\n\u201cThis cowardly action is intolerable and unacceptable,\u201d said the email, which was sent from an official in the department\u2019s Office of Finance and Operations.\n\n\u201cYour security at work should never be a concern,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cEvery leader in this building is ready to listen and help should you have any issues or suggestions.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Two months after the agency began investigating an apparent act of vandalism, a joint investigation has concluded the incident was an accident.", "authors": ["Danielle Douglas-Gabriel", "Reporter Covering The Economics Of Education"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bMONrPzkn6OvVvrUmJF0kWssl3Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C6MC55UOBQI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
