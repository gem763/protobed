Talks started early Thursday in downtown Washington, and as they continued into the afternoon, the negotiators sent for delivery of a takeout lunch.\n\nBefore the talks, Liu told US business groups that the Chinese team has come with \"utmost sincerity\" and willingness to carry out serious dialogue on issues of mutual concern, including trade balances, market access and investor protection, and push forward the negotiations to achieve positive progress.\n\nIn a meeting with US business leaders, Liu told Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, and Myron Brilliant, executive vice-president and head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce, that the trade relationship between the world's top two economies is vitally important. It has a strong spillover effect and global impact.\n\nBusinesses and consumers will suffer greatly with trade wars, which are not good for China, the US or the rest of the world, he said, according to a statement of the talks released by the Xinhua News Agency.\n\nAllen and Brilliant said there are no winners but only losers in trade wars, and the business community in the US does not want additional tariffs, according to the statement.\n\nAllen said both sides have demonstrated the ability to talk jointly about difficult issues and to resolve them.\n\n\"Now would be a good time to begin that process \u2014 the downward trends, the dynamics within the relationship, are of extreme concern,\" he said. \"We have more than 40 years of investment in this relationship that we wish to protect and to expand.\"\n\nHe said he hoped an agreement can be reached \"if not over the next few days, then hopefully, over the next few weeks\".\n\n\"Now we have the ideal time to reach that compromise,\" he added.\n\nLiu Chunsheng, an associate professor at Beijing-based Central University of Finance and Economics, said: \"It's difficult to predict now whether a partial deal will be reached this time, but I do hope the two sides can come to a mutually beneficial resolution as soon as possible.\"\n\nLiu added that a holistic perspective is needed when dissecting the yearlong China-US trade dispute. The trade row has not only influenced the world's two largest countries' sustainable growth but also dampened enthusiasm for investing globally and weighed on the world economy, he said.\n\nContact the writers at zhaohuanxin@chinadaily.com.cn", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/12/5da0f6dfa310cf3e97a0c37c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
