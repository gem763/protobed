The polarisation of British politics over the past four years or so into a sort of culture war has skewed everything. Brexit remains for many the overriding and defining issue for both sides. For many voters, though, other issues will take precedence, and the manner in which they will drive the vote is difficult to predict. Many British electors have now fully liberated themselves from traditional party ties.\n\nThe intervention or revival of smaller parties could also lead to an inconclusive result, on Brexit and much else. The long-term trend for the two larger parties to dominate political loyalties and argument was bucked at the 2017 election. Yet all the signs are that disruption is about to resume. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party is a far more formidable force than Ukip was in its final years, and the Liberal Democrats have found an unexpected boost since their drubbings in 2015 and 2017. The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru are also stronger contenders in their nations, taking votes from the various unionist parties. It is perfectly possible, for example, that the Conservatives will be wiped out in Scotland even as they win a majority in the UK as a whole.\n\nThere will also be a larger than usual cohort of incumbent \u201cindependent\u201d MPs standing this time, such as Frank Field or Philip Hammond, again with unpredictable consequences.\n\nMatters are complicated by the timing of the election. The colder, darker evenings are far from ideal for campaigning and canvassing, and which parties earn a net marginal advantage from this is unclear \u2013 and perhaps it matters less anyway in the digital age. The nation has not seen a wintry election since February 1974, and there is little evidence therefore about how it will affect the vote among the older generations and among students (given term dates). If the election turns out to be a closer-run affair that it now seems, then such small factors could make a difference.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s strategy has already had a practice run under Theresa May \u2013 with mixed results. She too decided that her Brexit deal, as it was developing, could not pass the existing House of Commons, even though she inherited a slender majority from David Cameron. So she went to the country to win her own mandate \u2013 and failed rather spectacularly to do so during a long and often poorly run campaign.\n\nMr Johnson looks to be a formable figure on the stump, but no one can know how he will in fact perform. Some of his public appearances since he stood for leader in the summer have been disappointing to say the least. By contrast, Jeremy Corbyn visibly enjoys engaging with a crowd, and has spent most of his political life preaching to the unconverted. However, unlike in 2017, he is now a very familiar figure, and his faults have come more to the fore. More importantly, the ambiguous Brexit policy he pursued in 2017 worked well then, but today\u2019s version seems to be winning few friends on either side. He may find himself relying too heavily on a core Labour vote of about a fifth of the electorate: That is not enough to form even a minority administration backed by other parties.\n\nThe British general election of 2019, then, is likely to be a scrappy affair in more senses than one. Neither main party is being entirely frank with the electorate about their Brexit policies, and both parties are vulnerable on a variety of policy areas. Mr Johnson will soon discover that \u201ctraditional\u201d Labour voters will not have fallen in love with him, even if they sympathise with his views on Brexit. They may turn to Nigel Farage, or they may be so disillusioned they just do not vote.\n\nJo Swinson will also see how far 18 per cent of the national vote will get her \u2013 more MPs, yes, but nowhere near enough to be a kingmaker in a hung parliament.\n\nThe election may settle very little, and Brexit purgatory could merely resume where it left off. By the time the nation sits down for its Christmas dinner it may have no more idea of what the future holds than it does today.", "description": "There are many arguments for an early general election.
