(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nFar away from the debate stage in Ohio, North Korean\u2019s regime is making some vague, ominous announcements: \u201cAides to Kim Jong Un are convinced the North Korean leader plans \u201ca great operation,\u201d state media said on Wednesday in a report that included lavish descriptions and images of the leader riding a white horse up North Korea\u2019s most sacred mountain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first glance, Kim Jong Un is currently sitting pretty. He\u2019s got a U.S. president who is willing to meet with him and have big summit meetings. He\u2019s still got his nukes, and the rest of the world has limited leverage to get him to give them up. The Trump administration\u2019s relationship with the South Koreans and Japanese is complicated at best. North Korea is launching missiles into Japanese waters again.\n\nThe North Korean regime back to testing and launching, and Trump hand-waves them away as small potatoes \u2014 even though the pause in testing and launches were one of the few measurable benefits of the previous effort at outreach.\n\nYes, the U.S. and South Korea are back to doing joint exercises, and there are still plenty of sanctions. The Norks recently called the negotiations \u201csickening.\u201d Our ambassador to South Korea recently characterized the most recent talks as, \u201cNorth Korea demanded that the United States do everything before doing anything.\u201d Maybe we\u2019re about to get another round of brinksmanship, with Kim Jong-un thinks he can get Trump to blink on sanctions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe North Koreans are probably miscalculating if they think Trump will make more concessions, but that wouldn\u2019t be the first time Pyongyang did that. Trump\u2019s dealing with impeachment, abandoning the Kurds, USMCA, China trade negotiations, and reelection. He just doesn\u2019t have any political capital to spend on, \u201chey, let\u2019s cut the North Koreans a break, let\u2019s see if that makes them more agreeable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe worst case scenario would be that Pyongyang concluded from the situation with the Kurds (and the aborted strike on Iran!) that when push comes to shove, Trump will absolutely refuse to use military force to defend an ally, particularly a year away from running for reelection.\n\nIf you\u2019re a country that\u2019s hostile to the United States, you\u2019re entering a brief but significant time period of golden opportunities. Trump isn\u2019t inclined to stand up for allies to begin with, he\u2019s reluctant to get involved in foreign wars, the U.S. is deeply internally divided, and Trump probably isn\u2019t going anywhere for another 14 months or so, at minimum. If you want to start some trouble or make aggressive moves, you do it now. The political environment in the United States probably will not change until November 2020 at the earliest. A hostile state could do something aggressive now, and then offer a peace deal to President Warren or whomever shortly after Inauguration Day, consolidating their gains . . .", "description": "Far away from the debate stage in Ohio, North Korean's regime is making some vague, ominous announcements.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
