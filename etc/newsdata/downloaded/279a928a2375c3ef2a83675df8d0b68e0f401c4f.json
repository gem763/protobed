Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough,\" he tweeted. \"The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.\"\n\nFor its part, Facebook Inc has taken fire since it disclosed earlier in October that it will not fact-check ads by politicians or their campaigns, which could allow them to lie freely.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook, angering those who support stronger controls on what politicians can say online.\n\nThe issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from US President Donald Trump's campaign that targeted former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nIn response, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran an ad on Facebook taking aim at its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The ad falsely claimed that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate falsehood as necessary to make a point.\n\nCritics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. This includes CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the policy of allowing lies \"ludicrous\" and advised the social media giant to sit out the 2020 election until it can figure out something better.", "description": "Social media site makes business decision to banish such expressions from its service - and Facebook could be next.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/7d765ed291744291a57440b0ec329480_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
