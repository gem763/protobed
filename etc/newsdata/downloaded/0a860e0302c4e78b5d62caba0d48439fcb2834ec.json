Previous purchase tab doesn't allow me to exchange or return. What are my options to address a broken device that is less than a year old? \u2014 Nicholas Provenzano (@thenerdyteacher) August 29, 2019 Report\n\nAn Amazon representative told BBC News: \"We are investigating. If customers have any questions or concerns, they should contact customer service.\"\n\nThe Echo Spot retails at \u00a3119.99 on the Amazon website.\n\nOverall it has received good reviews, with the website TrustedReviews awarding it 4.5 stars.\n\nWhat Hi-Fi describes it as \"an impressive piece of kit\" and notes \"the display is sharp\".\n\nIn the UK, goods are covered by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA), as well as European Union law.\n\n\"Generally we would always advise consumers who have goods which are clearly faulty to go back to the retailer in the first instance to make their claim under the statutory rights which exist under the CRA,\" Sylvia Rook, lead officer for fair trading from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said.\n\n\"Consumers have up to six years to make a claim for faulty goods (five years in Scotland).\n\n\"That doesn't mean that goods have to last for six years but it does mean that a trader can't refuse to consider a claim just because the consumer has had an item for a period of time, if it is proved to be faulty.\"", "description": "One owner, in Hampshire, says his device started to flicker 16 months after he had bought it.", "authors": ["Zoe Kleinman", "Technology Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5BBB/production/_108838432_mediaitem108838431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
