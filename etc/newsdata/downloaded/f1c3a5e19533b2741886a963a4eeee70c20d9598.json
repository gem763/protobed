The session low was $52.84 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 9.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures lost 40 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $58.26 a barrel. It sank as low as $57.23 a barrel, also the weakest since Aug. 9.\n\nPrices extended losses following data that showed U.S. manufacturing activity in August contracted for the first time in three years. Earlier, separate data showed euro zone manufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in August.\n\n\u201cThat deterioration is continuing to undermine the demand growth outlook for oil,\u201d said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York.\n\nOil prices have fallen around 20% since a 2019 peak reached in April, hit by concerns the trade war would dent oil demand.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks between the United States and China were going well, though he warned he would be \u201ctougher\u201d in negotiations if discussions drag on until his second term. Trump said the two sides would meet for talks this month.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He said China firmly opposes a trade war, the state news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nWashington began imposing 15% tariffs on an array of Chinese imports on Sunday, while China began placing new duties on U.S. crude oil.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade dispute \u201cis the single most important flat price driver of late,\u201d said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM.\n\nOn the supply side, Venezuela\u2019s oil exports fell in August to their lowest level in 2019, internal reports and Refinitiv Eikon data showed, following tougher U.S. sanctions.\n\nRussian oil production C-RU-OUT in August rose to 11.294 million barrels per day (bpd), data showed on Monday, hitting its highest since March and topping the rate Moscow pledged under a pact with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nAn employee demonstrates a sample of crude oil in the Yarakta Oil Field, owned by Irkutsk Oil Company (INK), in Irkutsk Region, Russia in this picture illustration taken March 11, 2019.
