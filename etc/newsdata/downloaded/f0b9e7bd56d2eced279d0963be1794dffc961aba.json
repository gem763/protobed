The segment, which has been in the works for a year now, includes interviews with chief executive officers of major companies including IBM IBM, -0.76% and Ford. F, +0.77%. Fox News parent company Fox Corp FOXA, +0.72% was previously owned by MarketWatch parent News Corp NWS, -0.21%.\n\nArtificial intelligence isn\u2019t just making demands to Siri on Apple\u2019s iPhones, AAPL, -1.46% or telling your Google GOOG, -0.71% email inbox to identify spam. Eventually, people will be talking about artificial general intelligence, which is machine learning \u2014 that is, the computer deciding on its own what is or isn\u2019t relevant to a person\u2019s request based on its past experiences. This technology has the potential to create entirely new jobs, eliminate other ones and also save lives, Bartiromo said, and the key for Americans to succeed in the face of this new technology is to understand where and how it will be implemented.\n\nSee: Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the workplace, but it\u2019s also dominated by men\n\nThe documentary will air on Sunday at 8 p.m. EST on Fox News FOX, +0.34%, and is broken into six parts. Bartiromo spoke with MarketWatch about how artificial intelligence will affect future workers and retirement, as well as her own plans.\n\nMarketWatch: What do you see as the biggest impact of artificial intelligence on businesses? Is there a certain sector or facet of the workplace that will be most affected?\n\nMaria Bartiromo: Artificial intelligence is powered by data so any job that involves a lot of data will be impacted first. So let\u2019s say you\u2019re a mortgage broker, or the person who looks at the eligibility of someone to see if they\u2019re going to get a mortgage. You have to go through large sets of data, which a machine can do fast.\n\nI think the industry that will be most impacted, in a good way, is health care. The machine can look at a radiology report, a mammogram, an MRI \u2014 it can look at a million eyes and understand which one of those eyes is diseased. Or a million skins and see really simply, easily and quickly what the specifics of that skin is and what the propensity is for it to have cancerous cells. That\u2019s what IBM\u2019s Watson is doing in hospitals \u2014 they\u2019re using AI in very big ways to understand routines and what these reports might show. It won\u2019t replace a doctor, but it will just be able to let the doctor do more. When you go to a doctor and you say you have a headache or stomach ache, the first thing the doctor does is eliminate things. That takes time. A computer can do that very quickly. I think it will be lifesaving.\n\nBut while it can be lifesaving, it can also be job killing in other industries. I think when you look at those industries, that\u2019s when the worry comes in and really sparks a debate in business about how to unleash artificial intelligence in an ethical way.\n\nMaria Bartiromo\n\nMW: People seem to think AI will replace older workers. What do you think?\n\nBartiromo: Not necessarily. It is really about a person\u2019s savvy with technology. You can be an older person and be really good at technology, you don\u2019t have to be a young person to understand how technology impacts things. So it\u2019s really about how savvy you are with these changes and how to keep up with this skill set, or you need to be trained. We have seen technology replace jobs our entire careers. We didn\u2019t know what jobs would be available in 1998 with the dot-com boom. I remember covering this with a front-row seat in the 1990s when Amazon AMZN, -1.50% went public. We didn\u2019t know what the technology meant, that drones might replace delivery people or shopping was going to move online as opposed to brick and mortar. There will be jobs, but the scary thing is we don\u2019t know about them yet. It is not targeted toward older people but it is targeted toward white collar.\n\nRead: How AI is catching people who cheat on their diets, job searches and college work\n\nMW: Will AI impact retirement, and if so, how?\n\nBartiromo: Work is shifting. I don\u2019t know how many people you know who retire at 65 and say \u201call right, I\u2019m going to go hit the hammock.\u201d I am certainly not going to do that. People may retire but they just retire from a job they had for 30 years and then they\u2019ll do something else. I am a firm believer of \u201cnever retire\u201d and the reason I say that is because you have to constantly keep your mind going and have to constantly challenge your mind because if you don\u2019t use it, you\u2019ll lose it.\n\nMW: What does retirement mean to you? What do you envision retirement even being for yourself?\n\nBartiromo: I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m nowhere near it. I know in my frame of mind right now, I\u2019m not going to go hit the hammock. I am a curious person. I love work, I love learning new things and I have an open mind to new ideas. So I doubt when I am faced with that prospect that I\u2019m just going to stop working. I\u2019m going to do something to enrich my mind. I have no expectations that when I retire from my job I\u2019m going to rest and relax. It\u2019s just not who I am.\n\nMW: What advice do you have for someone starting to work, especially if there will be more technological advancements in the workplace?\n\nBartiromo: I would say don\u2019t write this off. Understand what you don\u2019t know and make sure to bone up on technology if you are in an industry that is data-heavy. Make sure you understand that in the future, machines will be able to handle that so arm yourself with the right training to thrive in the profession. It\u2019s really important not to say \u201cI don\u2019t get that,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m lame when it comes to technology\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s a cop out and it will hurt you in the future. Make sure to improve on the skills you need regarding technology and make sure you know the systems.\n\nMW: What would you say are some of the biggest misconceptions of AI in the workplace?\n\nBartiromo: One misconception is that you have to be afraid of it. You have people like Elon Musk (the chief executive officer of Tesla TSLA, -2.42% ) who say it is dangerous but the reality is it is happening. Technology has always impacted jobs. Don\u2019t be afraid of it, understand it and try to educate yourself. Understand what parts of your routine are vulnerable to being replaced.\n\nAnother misconception is that when we talk about AI we are talking about Siri and your phone or the Echo home device. Yeah, that is artificial intelligence, but it is more about machine learning, so when I say \u201cSiri, put on yoga music,\u201d and it learns what yoga music is, that is machine learning. When you talk about artificial general intelligence, where the computer is mimicking the brain to a tee \u2014 that could be changing the way you live and work.\n\nThe last thing you want to be is the last man standing, not understanding the systems in your workplace. Maria Bartiromo, Fox News anchor\n\nMW: In your career reporting on business news, how have you seen the emergence of AI reported? How have people been talking about it and how has the perception of AI changed in those years?\n\nBartiromo: I have been covering business news for 30 years. I have had a front-row seat and seen many cycles and many different innovations. When I first got into business in 1989 at CNN, we were in the middle of the individual investor revolution, where individuals were hungry for information and wanted to arm themselves with information because they thought they could make their own investment decisions. So what happened then \u2014 we had a whole industry swarmed and discount brokerage firms like E*Trade, ETFC, -0.36% Ameritrade (now TD Ameritrade) AMTD, -0.79% and Schwab SCHW, -0.33% of course thrived in that. Information was people\u2019s currently and that was the power for them to get ahead in their lives.\n\nAlso see: The rise of artificial intelligence comes with rising needs for power\n\nFrom there, we saw the cycle and euphoria of the dot-com boom, so people were investing in things with a .com at the end of it because why? I don\u2019t know why. There were no revenue or earnings but the stock was trading at an enormous valuation. It was just mania where we thought we were on the doorstep of a new revolution.\n\nBack then, a lot of companies said they didn\u2019t have a dot-com site and they didn\u2019t need to compete with Amazon. We know now you did need to compete with Amazon because if you weren\u2019t online, you took a back seat. We are seeing companies look at AI and start adopting it slowly. We will see companies adopt it in a huge way because they\u2019re going to realize they have to do this to be competitive. The first adopters will be enterprise, so companies, not the consumer, and it will be in your jobs.", "description": "The Fox Business anchor says A.I. can be lifesaving, but also \u2018job killing\u2019", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR772_bartir_ZG_20190920131309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
