Yesterday, a bunch of ecomaniacs drove a dirty, diesel-powered, decommissioned fire engine into Central London.\n\nThey hosed down the Treasury \u2014 and themselves \u2014 with fake blood and then sat back and waited for the Old Bill to turn up.\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t they? Very little is likely to happen to them. Even when these lunatics are caught, the punishments handed out are derisory. They\u2019re soon back on the streets, up to their same old tricks.\n\nExtinction Rebellion hosed the Treasury with fake blood (pictured) and because they say they were doing it to save the planet, it appears to make it alright. If Al Qaeda claimed responsibility, there would be a full-scale alert and tanks on the perimeter\n\nIt turns out that one of the ringleaders was also involved in the plot a couple of months ago to ground planes at Heathrow.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t he in jail?\n\nTargeting planes flying in and out of a major international airport should be classed as an act of terrorism.\n\nLast Christmas, 150,000 people due to fly out of Gatwick had their travel plans ruined by reports of a drone in the vicinity.\n\nIf Al Qaeda claimed responsibility, there would be a full-scale alert and tanks on the perimeter.\n\nBut because Extinction Rebellion say they\u2019re doing it to save the planet, that\u2019s all right then.\n\nYesterday\u2019s daft stunt was just the start of a planned two weeks of demonstrations, aimed at bringing London to a standstill \u2014 again.\n\nIn April, 11 days of protests closed bridges and main roads, causing disruption to the daily lives of millions of people trying to go about their lawful business.\n\nScotland Yard has announced that it is bringing in specialist units to deal with the climate protesters which have been responsible for the blood-pouring (pictured) and setting up a pink sailing boat in the centre of Oxford Circus\n\nThe police simply stood aside and let them get on with it. Some even joined in. Remember the skateboarding Plod who became a social media sensation?\n\nWho can forget that ridiculous pink sailing boat bolted down centre stage in Oxford Circus, one of London\u2019s busiest junctions, for days on end.\n\nAt long last, the police seem to be taking the threat seriously. Or, at least, more seriously than they have up until now. Which isn\u2019t saying much.\n\nScotland Yard has announced that it is bringing in specialist units to deal with the climate protesters.\n\nBut we\u2019re not talking the Special Patrol Group here. The Yard is deploying officers trained in humanely releasing demonstrators who have chained or superglued themselves to buildings, railings or Tarmac.\n\nThe group quickly lost control of the hose and the red liquid sprayed into the road and themselves instead of the building\n\nCan\u2019t have the poor lambs hurting themselves, can we? When Extinction Rebellion first turned London into one big traffic jam last November, I wrote: \u2018The right to protest peacefully is an essential freedom in any democratic society. The right to make the lives of your fellow citizens a misery is not.\u2019\n\nLike most of these demos, though, disruption is not an unfortunate consequence, it\u2019s the whole point.\n\nBut, for some reason, this Extinction Rebellion rabble is indulged.\n\nI\u2019ve previously contrasted the handling of the eco-protesters with the brutal treatment meted out to Countryside Marchers in the past. The authorities seem to base their approach to demonstrations on what is judged to be the righteousness of their cause.\n\nThus, saving the polar bears: Good. Kid gloves all round. Pro-foxhunting: Bad. Let\u2019s crack some skulls, lads. Labour\u2019s unlovely shadow chancellor John McDonnell was on Radio 2\u2019s Jeremy Vine show yesterday giving unequivocal support to the Extinction Rebellion cause.\n\nWorkers clean outside the Treasury building in central London yesterday. The daft stunt was just the start of a planned two weeks of demonstrations, aimed at bringing London to a standstill \u2014 again\n\nIf we don\u2019t get behind them \u2018we won\u2019t be here\u2019, he declared with all the piety befitting his training as a Jesuit priest.\n\nHe had particular praise for the children bunking off school. Of course he did.\n\nWhat was it the Jesuits have always said? Oh yes: Give me the child and I\u2019ll give you the man.\n\nMake no mistake, eco-fascism is the new religion. Not for the first time, I find myself quoting Chesterton: When people stop believing in God they don\u2019t believe in nothing, they believe in anything.\n\nI can understand union members picketing in support of a pay rise, or to fight factory closures. I can even see the point of the Stop The War demos. At least they\u2019re trying to do something tangible.\n\nBut Extinction Rebellion? What is it they hope to achieve? Yesterday they draped a banner over the fire engine reading: \u2018STOP FUNDING CLIMATE DEATH\u2019.\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nThe Government has already gone beyond the call of duty, pledging unrealistic targets for decarbonising the economy.\n\nWhat do they expect ministers to do in response to another two weeks of disruption \u2014 close all fossil-fuel power stations and ban all cars tomorrow?\n\nNo, although I\u2019m sure the deluded hardline tree-huggers who turned out at the Treasury really do believe they can change the world.\n\nThen again, so did the Baader-Meinhof gang.\n\nBut for the majority of those planning to cause chaos over the next couple of weeks, it\u2019s simply a New Age version of a Jolly Boys\u2019 Outing.\n\nThey\u2019re demonstrating for the sake of it. Look at me, Mum, I\u2019m on Sky News!\n\nAnd to hell with the misery it brings to millions.\n\nOf course, in light of yesterday\u2019s stunt at the Treasury, the great irony is that ever since Boris, as London mayor, was forced by Mother Theresa to get rid of his water cannon, we can\u2019t even turn the fire hoses on them.\n\nMakes you proud to be British.\n\nPlay it again, Boaby! Still Game! Troy The Gardener Funniest story of the week came from New Zealand, where a high street sports shop in Auckland played pornography on a big screen above the front door for nine hours. Apparently, someone had hacked the system, much to the amusement of passers-by. I was reminded of the episode of the BBC Scotland comedy Still Game, in which the regulars of The Clansman discover an old porn tape featuring Boaby the barman as \u2018Troy the gardener\u2019. They lend it to department store security guard Shug, who takes it to work to watch on the CCTV system. Unfortunately, he presses the wrong button and the movie is beamed into Buchanan Street, to the delight of late-night shoppers \u2014 and the horror of Boaby who arrives too late to retrieve it. Hellooooo, big man!\n\nYou may have missed it, but this is supposed to be Sober October. It\u2019s another of those crass gimmicks, like growing moustaches in \u2018Mo-vember\u2019 \u2014 geddit? \u2014 supposed to \u2018raise awareness\u2019 of something or other.\n\nOne group who clearly didn\u2019t get the memo was that bunch of City bankers who managed to set their heads on fire during a bizarre drinking game involving flaming sambucas. Call me old-fashioned, but we\u2019re not talking Cardinal Puff here.\n\nSpeaking as someone who can do abstinence better than moderation, I see the point of taking a break from the gargle. The danger is that if you stay sober the whole of October, you may end up going on a bender in November and \u2014 with the Christmas party season looming \u2014 you won\u2019t remember December.\n\nFormer Newsround presenter John Craven, 79, is lamenting the fact that children\u2019s TV no longer has room for older presenters.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s become very youth orientated. We don\u2019t have the Tony Hart figures, the Johnny Morris figures, the John Craven figures . . .\u2019\n\nThey don\u2019t have the Rolf Harris figures, either.\n\nAnd, meanwhile, Jimmy Savile remains dead.", "description": "RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Scotland Yard is at last introducing specialist units to deal with Extinction Rebellion who are up to their same old tricks and claim it is for the environment.", "authors": ["Richard Littlejohn For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/23/19274812-0-image-a-33_1570141852264.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
