Every adult shelter bed in Minneapolis was filled, an advocate who was taking phone calls, told him. It meant another night spent riding the light rail back and forth between Minneapolis and St. Paul. Forty others like Hudson would also be denied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like this for three months,\u201d said Hudson, 45, a bag of clothes beside him. \u201cI don\u2019t like living on the street.\u201d\n\nA $400,000 federal grant offered to the city could provide temporary shelter for Hudson and dozens like him, and it\u2019s at the heart of a debate among officials and advocates on how the city of Minneapolis spends money it receives from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\nMinnesota Post: Where things stand with the effort to allow mining near the Boundary Waters\n\nFor those who don\u2019t want mining \u2014 or even the whiff of mining \u2014 to come anywhere near northern Minnesota\u2019s protected Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the last weeks of the Barack Obama administration were good ones.\n\nJust as Donald Trump was preparing to take office, the Obama administration declined to renew mineral leases held by the company Twin Metals, and began the process of blocking off nearly a quarter-million acres of Superior National Forest from mining projects for up to 20 years.\n\nFourth District DFL Rep. Betty McCollum, one of Congress\u2019 staunchest opponents of mining near the Boundary Waters, said back then that Minnesotans should celebrate the victories, but cautioned that \u201cwe have more work to do.\u201d\n\nShe was right. Shortly after Trump took office, proponents of allowing a path for mining to move forward in northeastern Minnesota have taken aim at the Obama decisions from every vantage point available.\n\nTwin Cities Pioneer Press: Democrat Matt Pelikan to run for attorney general\n\nMatt Pelikan, a Democratic attorney with significant political experience, is joining the ranks hoping to replace Attorney General Lori Swanson.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of unprecedented challenges for Minnesota and for the progressive values that I cherish,\u201d Pelikan, who will formally announce his campaign in the coming days, said in an interview. \u201cI believe we need a strong progressive attorney general now more than ever.\u201d\n\nThe race for Minnesota\u2019s top lawyer may or may not have an incumbent. Swanson, a three-term Democratic incumbent, is weighing whether to run again or vie in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nPelikan, like others, is not waiting for her to decide. Two Democrats \u2014 Rep. Debra Hilstrom and former Rep. Ryan Winkler \u2014 and two Republicans \u2014 activist Harry Niska and former Rep. Doug Wardlow \u2014 are already running for the office. Democratic Rep. John Lesch was running but dropped out on Friday.", "description": "Minneapolis Star Tribune:\u00a0With too many homeless and too few shelter .09/02/2019 3:12:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
