The technology was developed by researchers at the University of Bristol in partnership with Telecomm ParisTech and Sorbonne University in Paris.\n\nThe team says their work opens the door for a possible future with \u2018anthropomorphic devices\u2019 where gizmos have human characteristics.\n\nThe interface can be added to laptop touchpads to make them more \u2018human like\u2019 (PA)\n\nWe\u2019re going to be honest, this may draw a few stares in the coffee shop (PA)\n\nDr Anne Roudaut, associate professor at the University of Bristol, told the PA news agency: \u2018It [the artificial skin] may look unconventional probably because we are used to our senseless and rigid casings, but we feel there are strong advantages of using more malleable technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And the familiarity of the skin provides a more natural interface for end-users.\u2019\n\nTwo layers of silicone make up the Skin-On device (Marc Teyssier / SWNS.com)\n\nThe artificial skin was created using two layers of silicone \u2013 dubbed \u2018dermis\u2019 and \u2018hypodermis\u2019 layers \u2013 with an electrode layer in the middle made up of ultra-thin wires that act as sensors. Two different types of silicone were dipped in pigment and moulded to give the creation a skin-like texture.\n\nThe researchers said their artificial skin allows devices to \u2018feel the user\u2019s grasp\u2019 and has the ability \u2018to detect interactions such as tickling, caressing, even twisting and pinching.\u2019\n\nOne of the things the researchers said they were able to demonstrate was \u2018tactile emotions\u2019 with use of emojis. Marc Teyssier, a PhD student at Telecomm ParisTech and lead study author, said: \u2018A strong grip conveys anger while tickling the skin displays a laughing emoji and tapping creates a surprised emoji.\u2019\n\nHe told PA: \u2018This skin has a subtle surface texture \u2013 the sensing is performed in the dermis and the hypodermis layer (fat layer) and the elasticity is what allows us to perform expressive gestures such as pinching.\u2019\n\nThe team believe that their work, which is being presented at the 32nd ACM User Interface Software and Technology Symposium in the US, could allow people to have a richer emotional experience while using mobile phones or smartwatches. Mr Teyssier added: \u2018When we are talking to someone face-to-face, we sometimes use touch to convey emotions and more generally enrich the discourse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Now that mediated communication is performed through the devices, we lost this communication modality. With this project, we tried to combine the best of the two. The prototypes we developed propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.\u2019\n\nWould you add this to your gizmos? (Marc Teyssier / SWNS.com)\n\nWhile the concept of artificial skin has been explored in the field of robotics as scientists attempt to develop robots that look and act like humans, the researchers said they were more interested in working with everyday devices.\n\nDr Roudaut added: \u2018We have seen many works trying to augment human with parts of machines, here we look at the other way around and try to make the devices we use every day more like us, ie, human-like.\u2019", "description": "Who doesn't want to tickle their iPhone?", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90808556_1571649046.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
