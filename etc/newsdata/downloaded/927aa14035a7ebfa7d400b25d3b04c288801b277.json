I do what I want with my teams' (No me toques los huevos Patrick, que te doy. Mis equipos los hago yo).\n\nVictor Valdes has been sacked by Barcelona three months after joining the youth team setup\n\nThe defiant message from Valdes to Kluivert was the cue for Barcelona to tell Valdes that after barely 67 days in the job he was fired.\n\nHe said goodbye to his players and on Saturday they travelled to their match in Tarragona without him.\n\nOn Monday Valdes arrived on his black Harley-Davidson for a meeting with Sporting Director Eric Abidal and with Kluivert. His dismissal was confirmed and after a 40-minute meeting he was riding out of the club's Joan Gamper training ground through a back exit to avoid cameras.\n\nValdes is reported to have told Patrick Kluivert 'don't break my balls, Patrick or you'll get it'\n\nHe leaves the U19 team in danger of slipping out of the UEFA Youth League and with a trail of complaints over his conduct.\n\nThe club were not happy about the way he preferred 4-4-2 to the club's standard 4-3-3 formation, above all in a friendly designed to mark the opening of the stadium named in Johan Cruyff's honour.\n\nHe left some of the most promising talents out of some of his team selections. He complained about giving press conferences standing up instead of sat down behind a table and criticised the fact that the new Johan Cruyff Stadium, used by the B-team, was not available to the U19s.\n\nValdes had his complaints too. He did not like the way one young star player Llaix Moriba had supposedly gone to complain to Kluivert about the fact that he was not playing.\n\nHe was also upset that club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who appointed Valdes 11 weeks ago to great fanfare, had not picked the phone up to him to listen to his grievances.\n\nHe was also unhappy that he was not allowed to switch training to the afternoons because it upset the B-team's ability to call on players from the U19s.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN SPAIN:  Victor Valdes responded angrily to accusations he was mismanaging his players saying: 'Don't break my balls, Patrick or you'll get it.
