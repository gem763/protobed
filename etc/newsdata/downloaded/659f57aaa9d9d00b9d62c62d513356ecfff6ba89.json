The minutes revealed that most Fed officials viewed the July rate cut as a mid-cycle adjustment as opposed to the beginning of a long-term easing campaign. At the end of the most recent FOMC meeting, the committee cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, and markets are expecting more cuts ahead. With current risks weighing on the U.S. economy, Fed officials stressed the need for policy flexibility. Two FOMC members dissented from the Fed\u2019s latest rate-cut decision and felt that no rate cut was needed at the time.\n\n\u201cWe will hopefully get more clarity on future rate cuts when Powell speaks on Friday but, at this point, there is little sign that the Fed is willing to push back on the markets. As such, another 25bp cut in September still looks like a good bet, if only because the Fed will not want to disappoint lofty market expectations,\u201d Capital Economics explained.\n\nRead more\n\nTOP NEWS\n\nIn this Nov. 10, 2018 photo, Tesla Model S, battery operated ride-on cars for children, are displayed by the front window at a Tesla showroom in downtown Chicago.
