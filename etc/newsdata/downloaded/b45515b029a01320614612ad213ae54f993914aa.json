But it has come under fire from both wings of the deeply divided ruling Conservative Party, and prompted a string of resignations from the government. Two more ministers resigned on Monday.\n\nFacing defeat over the bill because of opposition from dozens of pro-Brexit MPs, the government agreed to changes, including a clause to toughen conditions over customs arrangements and another to ensure the UK is out of the EU\u2019s VAT system. A further amendment would enshrine in law a commitment to avoid a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nBrexit hardliners argue they are simply enforcing the 2016 referendum result and May\u2019s subsequent \u201cred lines\u201d laid down for the talks.\n\nBut furious pro-EU MPs accused the government of running scared of a hardcore minority of Brexiteers. They fear the changes will make May\u2019s plan \u2013 which is only a starting point for the next phase of negotiations with the EU - less acceptable to Brussels.\n\nMany pro-Europeans also oppose the plan as a poor substitute for EU membership, and calls are growing for a second referendum amid increasing parliamentary gridlock.\n\nA spokesman for the prime minister said the amendments were \u201cconsistent\u201d with the White Paper policy document which developed the Chequers plan. However, a further test lies ahead immediately when MPs debate a trade bill on Tuesday.\n\nWith her Conservative Party at war with itself over Brexit, Theresa May has little room for manoeuvre and her government\u2019s position in Parliament is precarious. The pressure is compounded by the need to agree a withdrawal deal with the EU by the autumn.\n\nAmid increasing talk of a challenge to her leadership, May is expected to ask MPs to bring forward the start of the summer parliamentary break to this coming Thursday instead of Tuesday next week.\n\nThe UK is set to leave the EU at the end of March 2019.", "description": "The British prime minister narrowly won a series of votes on key Brexit legislation in parliament after giving in to hardliners\u2019 demands, but deep divisions threaten further progress.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/22/13/78/1000x563_cmsv2_4136af68-79ec-598b-9a27-b4df5d77bb7e-3221378.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-16"}
