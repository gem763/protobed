In 1950, Walter Reuther, the legendary leader of the United Auto Workers union, and Charlie Wilson, the CEO of General Motors, agreed to a historic labor contract that bought the automaker five years of labor peace.\n\nAfter more than a decade of sometimes violent conflict and short-term contracts, Wilson wanted stability so he could expand his company. The result was a trendsetting deal that included not only substantial wage increases but also generous pension and health-care coverage. The Post labeled it \u201ca great event in industrial history.\u201d\n\nThose were the days. At the peak of its power at the end of World War II, the American labor movement \u2014 which had cooperated closely with management and government to create democracy\u2019s great arsenal \u2014 fundamentally altered the social contract in the United States. Fortune magazine said the Treaty of Detroit \u201cmade the worker to an amazing degree a middle class member of a middle class society.\u201d\n\nThe story of the Reuther-Wilson pact is told in Steven Greenhouse\u2019s \u201cBeaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor,\u201d an excellent account of how important strong unions were in moving our nation \u201ctoward greater economic and social justice,\u201d and how their decline has increased \u201cinequality and unfairness.\u201d\n\nGreenhouse, who spent 19 years covering labor and workplace issues for the New York Times, is unabashedly pro-labor without ignoring the union movement\u2019s warts and shortcomings. His essential point is that, while we can talk all we want about how technological change and the decline of manufacturing work have undercut the living standards of many Americans, the truth is that better wages and benefits are almost always the product of bargaining power. Building that power was the work of tough-minded idealists such as Reuther, backed by New Deal-era labor laws rooted in an understanding that mass purchasing power underwritten by decent wages was good for the overall economy.\n\nIn the years since the Treaty of Detroit, the negotiating leverage of American workers has been vastly diminished. In the absence of powerful unions, we have yet to find an alternative and sustainable way of representing employees\u2019 interests.\n\nWe have also lost the sense of solidarity that originally inspired Labor Day. Greenhouse recounts a conversation with his then-86-year-old mother when he was in Wisconsin covering Republican then-Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s offensive to gut collective bargaining and cut public employee benefits.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up,\u201d she told him, \u201cpeople used to say, \u2018Look at the good wages and benefits that people in a union have. I want to join a union.\u2019 Now, people say, \u2018Look at the good wages and benefits that union members have. They\u2019re getting more than I get. That\u2019s not fair. Let\u2019s take away some of what they have.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHow did we get to this point? In another must-read book for our moment, \u201cThe Economists\u2019 Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets, and the Fracture of Society,\u201d Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the growing role of professional economists since the late 1960s fundamentally altered popular understandings about how the world should work.\n\nWe have moved, Appelbaum argues, from a healthy respect for what markets can accomplish in their proper sphere to a \u201csingle-minded embrace of markets\u201d that \u201chas come at the expense of economic equality, of the health of liberal democracy, and of future generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the pursuit of efficiency,\u201d Appelbaum writes, \u201cpolicy makers subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers, trading well-paid jobs for low cost electronics.\u201d\n\nAppelbaum, who writes about economics and business for the New York Times editorial page, values what economists do, but the ones he respects most are those who understand the limits of a purely material understanding of what matters. He quotes the brilliant Amartya Sen: \u201cEconomic growth cannot sensibly be treated as an end in itself. Development has to be more concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms we enjoy.\u201d\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008, as Appelbaum suggests, will be seen historically as dropping the curtain on a period of market supremacy and radical individualism. The transition to the next act is not pretty. The rise of right-wing nationalism is part of the reaction against the earlier era\u2019s mistakes. The times call for democratic visionaries of Reuther\u2019s stripe who understand that free societies \u2014 and, yes, thriving economies \u2014 depend on sharing the fruits of our productivity and rebuilding a solidarity that can overcome our fractiousness.\n\nRead more from E.J.
