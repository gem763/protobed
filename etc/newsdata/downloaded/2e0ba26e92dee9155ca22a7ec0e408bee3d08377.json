The results show he came in 11th out of 104 competitors. Robinson says his wife was presented the finisher award he would have received. The couple had three children, the oldest just 6. Robinson said they are \"devastated.\"\n\nHis family described him in a statement as a \"devoted husband, father, and friend.\"\n\nOne of his friends, Ben Davis, 35, of Wichita, described Stanley as a \"running evangelist\" who had previously run at least two other much longer, 100-mile events. Davis ran alongside him to provide support for parts of those races.\n\n\"He loved the endurance challenge of overcoming the difficulty it would take on you,\" Davis said.\n\nHe said Stanley would prepare by running through the night and then going to work the next day on no sleep. Stanley worked for the nonprofit Kansas Leadership Center. Davis said Stanley focused on interfaith leadership development, teaching people to use their influence \"no matter how big or how small, to help others.\"\n\nThe intensity he brought to running, he also brought to parenting, Davis explained.\n\n\"Everybody who has kids knows how overwhelming it is, the chaos and the exhaustion. But he embraced it,\" Davis said. \"He was just such a remarkable person.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
