(Controllers in the southeast sector, Brindisi, may strike from 12 noon to 4pm instead.)\n\nWhat is the effect?\n\nAlitalia has already cancelled more than 200 flights \u2013 most of them domestic flights, but also a handful of links from London to Rome and Milan.\n\nThe Ops Group says of the ATC strikes: \u201cWhen these four-hour strikes go ahead, overflights and incoming intercontinental flights (ie those from outside Europe) are normally not significantly affected, but there are often big delays for flights to/from Italian airports.\u201d\n\nAlready, easyJet has cancelled 32 flights, affecting up to 5,000 passengers. A spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cWe have been advised of an Air Traffic Control and ground handling agents strike in Italian airports on Friday 25 October\n\n\u201cAffected customers have been notified by e-mail and SMS and will be able to change their flight free of charge or receive a refund. We advise customers to make any amendments to their booking on easyJet.com through the Manage Bookings tab.\n\n\u201cWe recommend all customers flying to or from Italy on Friday 25 October allow extra time to get to the airport and check the status of their flight on easyJet.com and Flight Tracker for live updates.\n\n\u201cAlthough this is outside of our control we would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience and would like to assure them that we are doing all possible to minimise any disruption.\u201d\n\nRyanair said: \u201cWe expect some level of disruption on the day including delays and the possibility of a small number of cancellations.\n\n\u201cAll customers affected by a flight cancellation or delay will be notified by an email and SMS message, advising of their options of a free move or a refund.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by these ATC strikes. We will do everything we can to minimise disruption, which is sadly beyond our control.\u201d\n\nBritish Airways hasn't responded, but its website does not yet indicate any cancellations or delays.\n\nDecisions on operations will be taken on Thursday afternoon, and if any disruption is expected you should be notified by email or SMS; ensure the airline knows your contact details.\n\nWhat are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?\n\nUnder European air passengers\u2019 rights rules no compensation is payable if a strike by workers unconnected with the airline causes the problem. But after a delay of more than three hours there is a duty of care to provide meals, and if necessary accommodation, until the airline can get you to your destination.\n\nIf your flight is cancelled, then the airline must get you on the first available alternative departure, even if that is on a rival carrier.\n\nIf I reach Italy, what will be happening with terrestrial transport?\n\nIt could be that your problems are only just beginning. Workers on Trenitalia begin a 24-hour strike strike at 9pm on Thursday, which will cause problems for commuter and longer-distance services. Local transport, including buses, trams and the underground may be out of action in Catania, Florence, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Rome and Turin.\n\nEven if you rent a car, there could be problems on the autostrada due to a walk-out by toll collectors.\n\nCan I cancel or postpone?\n\nIf you have booked a package holiday and your flight is cancelled, and there is not a reasonable alternative flight, you should be able to cancel or postpone your holiday.\n\nOtherwise It may be that your airline will allow you to switch away to an alternative date. But there is no obligation for the airline to do so if your flight appears to be operating normally.\n\nThe usual cancellation conditions apply, which will mean you may lose some or all of your money.", "description": "A national strike is planned for Italy on Friday 25 October 2019.
