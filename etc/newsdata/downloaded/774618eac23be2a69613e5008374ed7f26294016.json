Instead, he\u2019s actively searching the galaxy for something that seems to be related to the Jedi Order. That something is also \u201cvery precious to the Empire,\u201d which will stop at nothing to prevent Cal from succeeding.\n\nThe new trailer also shows off a few clips of gameplay, including Cal facing off in a proper lightsaber battle against one of the Emperor\u2019s Inquisitors (the dark Force users who were used to hunt down Jedi who survived the initial purge).\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order will be available on the PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One on November 15th.", "description": "EA showed off plenty of gameplay for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order back at E3, but today\u2019s new trailer shows a different side of the game: a much-welcome glimpse at the story.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/teY4lqQ9rSguIgy6CueJqpN0U9E=/26x0:2272x1176/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19235550/Screen_Shot_2019_09_26_at_2.31.45_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
