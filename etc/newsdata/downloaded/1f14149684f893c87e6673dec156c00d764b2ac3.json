The candidates were asked surprisingly tough questions by the ABC debate moderators, challenged to defend the blemishes on their records. They even turned the spotlight on one another to spur some entertaining, and useful, exchanges. Then debate moderator and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos tapped his cue cards and read the following bizarre question to Senator Cory Booker to kick off what would be the debate\u2019s sole climate change portion:\n\n\u201cLet me ask you about the recent fires in Brazil. After the recent fires in the Amazon, some experts have suggested that eating less meat is one way to help the environment,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cYou are a vegan since 2014\u2014that\u2019s obviously a personal choice\u2014but President Trump and Brazil\u2019s President [Jair] Bolsonaro are concerned that climate change regulations could affect economic growth. So should more Americans follow your diet?\u201d\n\nThe question, once it had stopped swerving and dipping and landed on its final destination of framing the encroaching crisis around the question of bacon or no bacon, drew a round of laughter from both the crowd and from Booker. With the inquiry, ABC made clear just how serious the network was about investing time in the most pressing issue facing the nation and the globe: not at all. After months featuring dissatisfaction with the scant climate coverage in prior debates, criticism of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s refusal to hold a dedicated climate debate, and exhaustion at CNN\u2019s seven-hour town hall attempting to fill the gap, the third Democratic primary debate spent a grand total of seven minutes on the issue Democratic voters consistently rate as one of their top concerns in the 2020 elections.\n\nTo his credit, Booker, responding to the veganism query, answered the question that Ramos should have asked, calling out the consolidation of the agriculture industry and the subsequent contributions of factory farms to overall worldwide carbon emissions. But like the debate\u2019s planners, Booker opted not to use his full time on climate change, shortening his response to go back to a previous question about foreign policy.\n\n", "description": "On Thursday night, Democratic voters were getting snatches of the policy fights they deserve\u2014just not on the topic that could matter most.", "authors": ["Nick Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/800128c32bc1ba4a1c7d5aa23e62a389ae80b269.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
