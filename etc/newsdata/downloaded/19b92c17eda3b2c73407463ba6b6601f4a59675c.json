James McConville, argues that China poses a more immediate threat than Russia, so the Army needs make the Asia-Pacific region its priority while deploying \"minimal current conventional forces\" in Europe to deter Russia.\n\nUS Army jump master Master Sgt.

McConville's spokesperson, Army Lt. Col. Curtis Kellogg, told Task & Purpose. \"Gen. McConville is committed to modernizing the Army's doctrine, equipment, and processes in support of the National Defense Strategy.\"\n\nThe recommendation from ATT is just that \u2014 a recommendation \u2014 and the team ultimately defers to the Army staff to \"conduct a more comprehensive analysis to further understand the second and third order effects\" of the two options they present.\n\nBut in order to stay on track and have a MDO-capable force by 2028, which is the deadline the service has been aiming for, the ATT says that senior Army leaders may need to have decisions made sooner rather than later.", "description": "China is \"anticipated to surpass Russia as the greater competitor to the United States in a 2028 to 2035 timeframe,\" according to the Army.", "authors": ["Haley Britzky", "Task"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93ace42e22af66397b2438?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
