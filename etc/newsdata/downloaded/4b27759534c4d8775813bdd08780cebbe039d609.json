He wasn\u2019t even the youngest player to score in the match, with Luke Matheson - playing the 14th game of his professional career at a ground close to his high school - equalizing in the 76th minute to take the game to penalties.\n\nUnited converted all its spot kicks in the shootout and won it 5-3. The reward: A fourth-round trip to Chelsea, which had a much easier time in dispatching fourth-tier Grimsby 7-1 at home.\n\nThe performance and result highlighted United\u2019s lack of strength in depth this season, though Greenwood continues to be a bright spark. He scored for a second straight match at Old Trafford, having grabbed the winner against Astana in the Europa League last week.\n\nWith Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial currently injured, Greenwood could be set for an extended run in the team under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who has described the youngster as one of the best finishers he has ever seen.\n\nHUMILIATION FOR THE HAMMERS\n\nOxford, which plays in the third tier, rested six of its regular players but still thrashed West Ham 4-0 in an embarrassing result for the team that beat Man United in the Premier League at the weekend.\n\nAll of Oxford\u2019s goals came in the second half at Kassam Stadium.\n\nThird-tier Burton Albion beat Bournemouth 2-0 in a match featuring three floodlight failures that led to 28 minutes of second-half stoppage time being played, and Sheffield United lost 1-0 at home to third-tier Sunderland.\n\nBrighton was the fourth Premier League team to lose Wednesday, beaten 3-1 at home to fellow top-flight side Aston Villa.\n\nLIVERPOOL THROUGH\n\nIt was a memorable night for two teenagers for Liverpool.\n\nAt 17 years and 250 days, Ki-Jana Hoever became the fourth youngest scorer for the club when he headed in the second goal in the 2-0 win at MK Dons. It followed the opener by James Milner, one of the senior players in an otherwise weakened lineup fielded by manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\nHarvey Elliott also played for Liverpool, becoming the youngest player to start a competitive match for Liverpool at 16 years and 174 days.\n\nFOURTH-ROUND DRAW\n\nAston Villa vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers\n\nEverton vs. Watford\n\nBurton Albion vs. Leicester\n\nManchester City vs. Southampton\n\nChelsea vs. Manchester United\n\nCrawley vs. Colchester\n\nLiverpool vs. Arsenal\n\nOxford vs. Sunderland\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Manchester United narrowly avoided one of the most embarrassing cup exits in its history, only beating third-tier struggler Rochdale in a penalty shootout after conceding a goal to a 16-year-old school kid in normal time.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/britain_soccer_league_cup_02308_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
