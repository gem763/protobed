They fired rubber bullets and teargas canisters, dispersing demonstrators in Beirut\u2019s commercial district. Dozens of people were wounded and detained.\n\nPrime minister Saad Hariri blamed his partners in government for obstructing reforms that could ward off economic crisis. He gave them a 72-hour deadline to stop blocking him, hinting he may otherwise resign.\n\nHariri, addressing protesters, said Lebanon was going through an \u201cunprecedented, difficult time\u201d. The country\u2019s biggest protests in a decade recall the 2011 Arab revolts which toppled four presidents. Lebanese people from all sects and walks of life have come out on to the streets to wave banners and chant slogans urging Hariri\u2019s government to go.\n\nThe rallies follow warnings by economists and investors that Lebanon\u2019s economy and corruption-riddled financial system were closer to the brink than at any time since the wartorn 1980s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A masked demonstrator with a teargas canister amid clashes with security forces in the centre of Beirut.

Either our partners in government and in the nation give a frank response to the solution, or I will have another say. The deadline left is very short. It\u2019s 72 hours.\u201d\n\nProtesters poured through villages and towns as well as the capital, Beirut, for a second day. No political leader, Muslim or Christian, was spared their wrath. They called for leaders including Hariri, president Michel Aoun and parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, to step down.\n\nThe mood was a mixture of rage, defiance and hope. As night fell, crowds waving Lebanese flags marched through the streets as patriotic music blared from loudspeakers. They shouted: \u201cOur demands are one, our objective is one: the people want the downfall of the regime.\u201d\n\nSome protesters fainted as security forces fired teargas. The Red Cross said its teams had treated 160 people wounded in protests since Thursday evening. \u201cYou should be protecting us. Shame on you,\u201d a young man yelled as he covered his face against the choking fumes.\n\nLebanon\u2019s internal security apparatus said 52 police were injured on Friday and 70 people were arrested.\n\nSome protesters, including men in black hoods, blocked roads, set tyres on fire and used iron bars to smash storefronts in Beirut\u2019s affluent downtown district.\n\nSome streets in the capital looked like a battlefield, strewn with rubber bullets, smashed cars, broken glass and torn billboards. Firefighters struggled late into the night to douse fires.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands of Lebanese blocked major roads and burned tyres for a second day to protest at corruption and proposed tax hikes.

Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates warned their citizens against travelling to Lebanon. Bahrain told its nationals to leave at once.\n\nLebanon\u2019s foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, who is Aoun\u2019s son-in-law, also blamed other parties for blocking reforms, saying the government must work to stop corruption and avoid imposing new taxes.\n\nThe latest unrest erupted out of anger over the rising cost of living and new tax plans, including a fee on WhatsApp calls.\n\n\u201cWe came to the streets because we can no longer bear this situation. This regime is totally corrupt,\u201d said Fadi Issa, 51, who marched with his son. \u201cThey are all thieves, they come into the government to fill their pockets, not to serve the country.\u201d\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Shia protesters also attacked the offices of their deputies from the influential Hezbollah and Amal movements in southern Lebanon.\n\nTo boost revenues, a government minister on Thursday unveiled a new fee for WhatsApp calls that fuelled outrage. But as the protests spread hours later, the telecoms minister, Mohamed Choucair, revoked the planned levy.", "description": "Dozens wounded and detained as warnings over failing economy spark biggest protests in decade", "authors": ["Reuters In Lebanon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb3d0fc7d45cfd6eb716544783e0d08860a7fd18/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55016059f02ac77aaa2978a4747d8450", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
