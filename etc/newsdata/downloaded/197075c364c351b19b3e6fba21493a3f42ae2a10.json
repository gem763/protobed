The materials were imported from the Apulia region in Italy, which has for centuries supported the building of some of the world\u2019s most beautiful structures.\n\nAccording to Mr. Fleisher, another 500 pieces of the limestone were used to create the 30-foot tall, custom-designed dome over the home\u2019s foyer. \"Its design was actually modeled on the Pantheon,\" Mr. Fleisher said. \"It\u2019s a sensational entry into the home.\"\n\nThe foyer leads to the home\u2019s great room on the main floor, which is flanked by the kitchen, dining room, family room, library, office and one bedroom. The master bedroom suite, three bedrooms and a laundry room are found on the next floor up, while the top floor has a large game room with a terrace, a sitting room and two more bedrooms.\n\nMore: Nearly 28,000-Square-Foot D.C.-Area Home to Hit Auction Block\n\nThere is also a 1,180-square-foot guest house with two bedrooms and three full bathrooms, which Mr. Fleisher said is a unique attribute for properties in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\n\n\"And the garage holds eight to 10 cars and has electric car chargers and security cameras,\" Mr. Fleisher said. \"That\u2019s very rare in D.C.\u2014with most homes you are lucky to find a three-car garage.\"\n\nStats\n\nThe 10,430-square-foot home sits on a 0.4-acre lot and has 11 bedrooms, 12 full bathrooms and five partial bathrooms.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe home\u2019s lower level houses a world of luxury spots, which include a complete spa with a sauna and hot tub, a massage room, a state-of-the-art gym, a professional wine cellar, a game room, a secure safe room and a pet-washing station.
