Police arrested the driver who is from Northern Ireland and charged him with murder.\n\nThey also shifted the vehicle to a safe place to take care of the bodies. An official of the police said that identifying the victims would be a lengthy process and assured that it will be a priority. The National Crime Agency has also jumped into action. It will make efforts to identify if there is involvement of any organized crime groups.\n\nThe BBC says the trailer appeared to be a refrigerated unit, where temperatures could be as low as minus 25C.\n\nIt would be \"absolutely horrendous\" for any human being who might be inside.
