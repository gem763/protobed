It's extremely eerie and weird,' said Professor David Soren, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona said.\n\nA 10-year-old was discovered lying on its side in a fifth-century Italian cemetery previously believed to be designated for babies, toddlers and unborn fetuses\n\nThose present at the site said the stone was forced inside the jaw, showing it was put there with intent.\n\nThe remains were found in the Cemetery of Children where other bizarre discoveries have been made.\n\nElsewhere another child, believed to be aged three at the time of death, was covered in stones.\n\nTests have so far discovered the body was likely to have been buried in the fifth century at the time of a malaria outbreak.\n\nTeams investigating burials have found what they believe is evidence of witchcraft.\n\nA huge stone was plucked from the jaws of the corpse which experts say may have been put there to stop the skeleton rising from the dead\n\nItems dug up included raven talons and bronze cauldrons.\n\nThe cemetery may have been designated for children with diseases. Over the summer five new grave sites were found in the cemetery, under a tiled tomb.\n\nBioarchaeologist Jordan Wilson, a PhD student who examined the body said: 'This is a very unusual mortuary treatment that you see in various forms in different cultures, especially in the Roman world, that could indicate there was a fear that this person might come back from the dead and try to spread disease to the living.'\n\nDavid Pickel, a PhD student a Stanford who directed the excavation said he knew he had found something rare when he reached the tomb.\n\nOther medieval methods of 'stopping vampire' corpses returning to earth include burying them with a stake through the heart.\n\nCases of such have been found across Europe and in Britain.\n\nThe child is believed to have died from malaria but the community in the 5th Century thought he was a vampire\n\nIt is believed to be a 'deviant burial', where people considered the 'dangerous dead', such as vampires, were interred to prevent them rising from their graves to plague the living.\n\nOnly a handful of such burials have been unearthed in the UK.\n\nIn Bulgaria in 2012 archaeologists found remains from a third grave in central Bulgaria linked to the practice.\n\nThe skeleton was tied to the ground with four iron clamps, while burning embers were placed on top of his grave.\n\nThe bones of a man in his thirties were believed to be at least several centuries old, and experts believed he had been subjected to a superstition-driven ritual to prevent him from becoming one after his death.\n\nTwo years later further such gruesome graves were found at the ancient temple of Perperion, south-east of the Bulgarian capital Sofia.", "description": "The ancient funeral practice took place when people feared the person would rise from the dead and infect people, experts revealed.", "authors": ["Zoie O'Brien For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/18/5020950-0-image-a-4_1539450837150.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-13"}
