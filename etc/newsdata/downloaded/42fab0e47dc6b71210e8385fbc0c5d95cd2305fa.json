We\u2019re coming back!\u201d they chanted, waving sky-blue and white Argentine flags.\n\nAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who is no relation to the former president, had 48.1% of the votes compared to 40.4% for Macri, with almost 97% percent of the votes counted, election officials said. He needed 45% of the vote to avoid a runoff.\n\nAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez served as chief of staff from 2003 to 2007 for Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s late husband and predecessor as president, Nestor Kirchner. He remained in the position during part of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s term as president but left after a conflict with farmers in 2008.\n\nFor many voters, placing the former aide at the top of the ticket made it more palatable. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who represents the more radical wing of the Peronist party, is both loathed and loved across the country. She also faces a string of corruption investigations, although she denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cToday, Alberto is the president of all Argentines,\u201d Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez told supporters, some of whom brandished tattoos with her and Kirchner\u2019s images.\n\nSome worried that the Peronist victory would scare off investors and revive the interventionist policies that choked the economy with restrictions on imports, exports and foreign currency exchanges during Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s rule from 2007 to 2015.\n\nArgentina\u2019s inflation rate already is one of the highest in the world, nearly one-third of Argentines are poor, and its currency has continued to plunge under Macri, who came into power in 2015 with promises to boost South America\u2019s second-largest economy and one of the world\u2019s top grain suppliers.\n\nOrdinary Argentines are haunted by the country\u2019s worst economic collapse in 2001-2002, when banks froze deposits, the local currency lost about 70% of its value and 1 in 5 people were unemployed. To protect themselves, many still stash dollars in vaults or under the mattress.\n\n\u201cThe last two years have been brutal in Argentina,\u201d said Benjamin Gedan, an Argentina expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cVoters have suffered a painful recession, unimaginably high inflation and a debt crisis. No incumbent could survive in these conditions.\u201d\n\nWhen Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez topped party primaries in August, stocks plummeted and the peso depreciated on investor fears of a return to the populist economic policies of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. Argentina Central Bank president Guido Sandleris said that since then, Argentina has spent about $22 billion to guard the peso. He also promised Monday to protect the bank\u2019s foreign reserves. And immediately after Sunday\u2019s election results came in, the Central Bank announced it would sharply limit the amount of dollars that people can buy: to $200 a month from a previous $10,000 a month, until December.\n\nThe peso strengthened slightly to 63 per dollar, and markets remained fairly steady Monday; investors had enough time to factor in a Fern\u00e1ndez victory, pulling their dollars out of Argentina ahead of time, said Buenos Aires-based economic analyst, Enrique Dentrice.\n\nThe investors \u201calready took all the funds that they had to take\u201d so the dollars that are left \u201cis what Argentines have,\u201d Dentrice said.\n\nStill, economic fears have not disappeared. Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez is \u201can untested leader\u201d whose proposed economic solutions remain a mystery, Gedan said.\n\n\u201cThe crucial question is what the dynamic will be between the pragmatic president and more ideological and polarizing vice president,\u201d said Michael Shifter, head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. Shifter said Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez has hard-core support of about 30% of Argentines. \u201cThe nature of that power struggle will determine the direction of Argentina\u2019s economic, social and foreign policy in coming years.\u201d\n\nShifter said that despite some fears, a return of the populist policies under Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez is highly unlikely.\n\n\u201cToday Argentina simply does not have the economic conditions for unchecked spending,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will not be a replay of her presidency.\u201d\n\nCristina Fern\u00e1ndez and Nestor Kirchner dominated Argentina\u2019s political scene for 12 years. Many credit them for restoring its sense of pride and sovereignty after the 2001-2002 crisis by negotiating or paying off most of Argentina\u2019s defaulted debt.\n\nAt \u201cLo de Nestor\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cNestor\u2019s Place,\u201d a themed bar celebrating the former first couple, large framed wall photos show them celebrating with big crowds, embracing, and meeting with the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Bolivian President Evo Morales and other leftist leaders. Wall plaques celebrate the Kirchners\u2019 nationalization of the pension system, main airline and oil company.\n\n\u201cHer return means that Argentina\u2019s society \u2026 understood that politics should work in a different way,\u201d said bar manager Gabriela Cabanillas.\n\nInsurance worker Edgardo Narbais disagreed.\n\nCristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s return to power means \u201cless institutions, more harassment, and just using chicanery to build power,\u201d Narbais said. \u201cThis is a return to the past.\u201d\n\nOn the election trail, Fern\u00e1ndez criticized Macri\u2019s decision to seek a record $56 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Now, markets will closely monitor the new president\u2019s approach to an institution that many Argentines blame for creating the conditions that led to the economic collapse at the beginning of the decade.\n\n\u201cArgentina will be on even more uncertain ground as negotiations with the IMF could go either way,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Paul Byrne, Almudena Calatrava and Natacha Pisarenko in Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Paul Harloff in New York, contributed to this report.", "description": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Divisive Peronist leader and former Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez is once again in a top position of power, a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/7d7fb7_argentina-elections-69048-peronist-presidential-candidate-alberto-fern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
