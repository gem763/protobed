The \u201cWill & Grace\u201d co-stars took issue with a Trump fundraiser happening in their city and called for donors to be doxxed.\n\n\u201cI think they have the bully pulpit right now to say it out loud. I don\u2019t think it permeates Hollywood to the degree that you think it is,\u201d O\u2019Hurley said on \u201cAmerica\u2019s News HQ\u201d Monday. \u201cI think there is a nature among liberal thinkers to form packs, to form groups, whereas the conservative mind is basically an individual, and they\u2019re tougher to find.\u201d\n\nCELEBRITIES CALL FOR GUN CONTROL AFTER TEXAS SHOOTING: 'WE HAVE A CRISIS HERE'\n\nAs for Messing and McCormack\u2019s tweets, the former \u201cSeinfeld\u201d star described them as \u201clunacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just say I\u2019m embarrassed for both of them because I know them both, I\u2019ve worked with Debra before. They\u2019re both smart people... they do wonderful work,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut, they\u2019re pushing a case that falls apart from the sheer weight of its lunacy, as though the Hollywood community needs to be purged of this social and intellectual hygiene problem called conservative thinking. It underscores the fact that we aren\u2019t receptive to a diversity of thought which is the exact opposite of what you feel the liberal way would be, and I find that obscene.\u201d\n\nThe star, an outspoken conservative, went on to explain that he personally relished the opportunity to discuss differences of thought with fellow actors, naming two of his former co-stars as an example.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be a conservative in Hollywood. Even though there are many of us, you do feel you are an island fighting the storm... all viewpoints must be observed and respected,\u201d he shared. \u201cAt the same time we are supporting free thinking, we also have to support free receptors \u2013 people that will allow other ideas to infect them. Some of the best convos I\u2019ve ever had on 'Seinfeld'... were with Michael Richards who thinks totally different than I do. I couldn't wait to present him with an issue because I was always interested in his perspective.\u201d\n\n'WILL & GRACE' STAR CELEBRATES SIGN CALLING BLACK TRUMP VOTERS MENTALLY ILL\n\nO\u2019Hurley continued: \u201cBryan Cranston... is the complete opposite of me. We can sit for hours and discuss an idea... not with the premise of trying to convince each other.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the O\u2019Hurley has discussed the difficulties of being a conservative in show business. He previously appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in 2017 to discuss the issue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cEvery time I have mentioned that I supported Trump in this election, people get vicariously angry at me, and they don't believe that it's possible that someone might think differently than they do,\" O'Hurley said at the time. \u201cThere is a band of conservatism in Hollywood, but it leans so much to one side that it doesn't allow for free discussion.\u201d\n\nFox News' Leland Vittert contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cSeinfeld\u201d actor John O\u2019Hurley sounded off on Hollywood for suppressing \u201cdiversity of thought\u201d in the wake of Debra Messing and Eric McCormack calling for supporters of President Trump to be outed.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/b317a56de4ddd44c06b94d067a9e20baw-c0xd-w640_h480_q80.jpg"}
