Asked whether the gun had been fired, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking into that.\u201d As for Bomba\u2019s body-worn camera, Jones said, \u201cWe are looking at that evidence now to see if the body camera was on and whether it was functioning at the time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said investigators also were trying to locate all security cameras in the area. At Monday\u2019s afternoon briefing, he said they had not seen any video yet that shows possible suspects or offers a clue of what happened.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the investigation continued Monday, a heavy police presence in the area caused some road closures. Schools in the vicinity were told to shelter in place, but the precaution was later lifted.\n\n\u201cOur prayers are with his family, the Montgomery Co. Police, Fire and Rescue community, & with all those who serve & protect our communities,\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said on Twitter. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMontgomery County Council President Nancy Navarro (D-District 4) expressed the council\u2019s \u201cdeepest condolences,\u201d asking the public to \u201cplease keep Officer Bomba and his family in your thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nAdded County Executive Marc Elrich (D), \u201cOur county lost one of our own, and I ask the people of Montgomery County to keep Officer Bomba\u2019s family, his friends and fellow officers in your hearts during this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nJustin Wm. Moyer, Rebecca Tan and Rachel Chason contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Police said the officer suffered a bullet wound after reporting \u201cdisorderly subjects\u201d in a parking garage.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "Paul Duggan", "Crime Reporter", "Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ziGy7urChqlVa-Xzdn3bwXvIn84=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UJPONMHOUEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
