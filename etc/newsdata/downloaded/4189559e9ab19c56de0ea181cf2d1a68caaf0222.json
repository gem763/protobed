It has been a long debate - and I am grateful to the noble Lords who have stayed the course - it shows the importance of the work we do and the issue we are debating,\" she said.\n\n\"I am grateful that we are now able to confirm that we will be able to complete all stages of the bill in a time-honoured way by 5pm Friday.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe agreement was announced after a momentous day in the Commons in which the prime minister suffered defeats over the Brexit bill and his plan for a snap general election.\n\nMr Johnson had wanted an election on 15 October, but Labour and other opposition MPs would not back the move while the option of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October remained open to the PM.\n\nHe needed two-thirds of all MPs to vote in favour, under the rules set by the Fixed Terms Parliaments Act, but after Labour whipped its members to abstain, there were only 298 in favour of the motion and 56 against. That left Mr Johnson 133 short of his target.", "description": "Claims the Lords would hold up the bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit were allayed in the early hours.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B47A/production/_108620264_houseoflords.jpg"}
