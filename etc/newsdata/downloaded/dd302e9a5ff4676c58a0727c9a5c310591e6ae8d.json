Ruth Smeeth (right) yesterday said it was her \u2018intention to vote for a deal\u2019 unless rights were \u2018undermined\u2019 by the deal\n\nJeremy Corbyn made clear yesterday that he wanted Labour MPs to vote against the revised withdrawal agreement, saying it would lead to a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 on workers\u2019 rights.\n\nThe party has not said whether MPs who defy him would lose the party whip. Even so, as many as ten Labour MPs are reported to be considering voting for the deal if Mr Johnson\u2019s pledges on workers\u2019 rights are enshrined in law.\n\nRuth Smeeth yesterday said it was her \u2018intention to vote for a deal\u2019 unless rights were \u2018undermined\u2019 by the deal.\n\nLabour MPs John Mann, Sir Kevin Barron and Jim Fitzpatrick are also understood to support the agreement.\n\nMr Johnson will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 tomorrow.\n\nYesterday, the PM reached out to Labour MPs, saying: \u2018It is a good text, and it gets to the heart of what we want to achieve with the EU. It does also contain important provisions and commitments that this country gladly makes about our determination to maintain the highest possible standards on environment and social protection.\u2019\n\nThe agreement, announced yesterday morning, provides for a \u2018level playing field\u2019 on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection and commits Britain to \u2018maintain... standards at the current high levels\u2019.\n\nHowever, the promise is part of the political agreement that sits alongside the withdrawal agreement \u2013 not the withdrawal agreement itself.\n\nIt is understood that Downing Street is offering to write these protections into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the legislation which enacts the Brexit deal, to make them legally binding and get the Labour rebels on side.\n\nMr Kinnock and 18 other Labour MPs wrote to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this month, declaring that they \u2018wish to see the British EU referendum result honoured without further delay\u2019.\n\nMr Johnson (pictured alongside president of the European Comission Jean-Claude Juncker (second-from-right), Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (left) and European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (right) during a press conference on the Brexit deal in Brussels) will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 tomorrow\n\nOne of the signatories told Huffington Post that around ten Labour MPs are now in the mood to vote for \u2018any deal\u2019.\n\nOn Wednesday night Mr Kinnock suggested that he could support the Brexit deal.\n\nSpeaking to Robert Peston on ITV, the MP was asked if he would back the deal. He said: \u2018Yes, if the text meets Labour\u2019s six tests... The level playing field is absolutely crucial.\u2019\n\nYesterday Mrs Smeeth said: \u2018It is my intention to vote for a deal unless Boris has completely undermined workers\u2019 rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.\u2019\n\nMr Mann said: \u2018I will vote for this deal... We voted to leave, and I\u2019m happier to leave with a deal that gives stability for businesses and jobs in this country, that\u2019s what a deal does... I think the deal will get through.\u2019\n\nAnother Labour backbencher told the Huffington Post he would consider voting for Mr Johnson\u2019s deal if it enshrined workers\u2019 rights. \u2018If Boris can write all these things on to the face of a Bill, and bring that Bill forward pronto, we can vote for it,\u2019 he said.\n\nLabour MP Graham Stringer, who campaigned for Brexit, said he would back the Bill if it is \u2018genuinely deal or No Deal\u2019.\n\nDespite the Prime Minister\u2019s pledges Mr Corbyn said he would not support the deal. \u2018These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover,\u2019 he said.", "description": "Behind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19859338-0-image-a-26_1571348751126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
