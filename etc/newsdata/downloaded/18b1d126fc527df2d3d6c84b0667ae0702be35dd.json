Viral Press\n\n\u201cAll the dishes in the food menu are low on cholesterol and fat. This initiative will help our crew to remain healthy and fit,\u201d an Air India spokesperson told The Times of India.\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with encouraging healthy eating, the airline has courted controversy in the past for trying to impose weight limits on cabin crew.\n\nIn 2015, Air India grounded 130 of its flight attendants, most of whom were women, because they were overweight.\n\nThe airline said the decision was based on safety concerns and recent government regulations, but critics called the move \u201cshockingly sexist\".\n\nAir India tested 3,500 employees and declared 600 overweight or obese. These staff members were put on a diet and given an exercise regime to follow before being reassessed.\n\n\u201cAbout 130 of them failed the reassessment,\u201d said an Air India official. \u201cWe are now declaring them permanently unfit for their job as flight attendants.\u201d\n\nAviation industry consultant Mark Martin told The Telegraph at the time: \u201cThis move to impose a certain BMI, ignoring experience and other performance parameters, is immature, misogynistic and shockingly sexist.\n\n\u201cWe seem to have lost the plot on what is needed from flight attendants.\u201d\n\nWeight limits for Indian flight attendants date back to the 1980s, when Air India began circulating height and weight charts.", "description": "Air India is putting all its cabin crew and pilots on a\u00a0low-fat diet.
