This market is growing.\u201d\n\nWhile HTC\u2019s Vive headset, which ranks among the top-selling brands alongside devices from Sony (6758.T) and Facebook\u2019s (FB.O) Oculus, has shown promise in the fledgling virtual reality (VR) sector, it remains a niche device.\n\nThe company\u2019s smartphones, which were industry trailblazers when first introduced in 2008, have for years maintained a global market share of 1% or below.\n\n\u201cOur goal at HTC is to be at the center of 5G,\u201d said Maitre.\n\n\u201cIf we need the smartphone to win the battle, we\u2019ll keep the smartphone. If we don\u2019t need the smartphone to win the battle, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nIn January, the company began shipping the Exodus 1, a handset that comes with a number of blockchain-centric features such as a built-in cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nHTC said in a statement that Wang will retain her role as chairwoman of its board after resigning as CEO.\n\nLast year HTC laid off 1,500 employees, roughly one quarter of its workforce. Earlier, about 2,000 HTC employees moved to Google as part of a $1.1 billion acquisition deal.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual revenue in 2018 hit NT$23.7 billion, a 62% drop from a year earlier.", "description": "HTC Corp <2498.TW> has hired Yves Maitre as its new CEO, the smartphone maker said on Tuesday as it announced the replacement of Cher Wang by the former Orange executive.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
