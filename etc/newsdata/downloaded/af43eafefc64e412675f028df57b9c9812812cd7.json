The gains game after Walmart announced Tuesday that it would change its policies around gun-sales in response to two deadly shootings that killed 24 people at Walmart stores in El Paso, Texas and Southaven, Mississippi.\n\nIn addition, Walmart will bar shoppers from openly carrying guns in stores, although the policy will vary by location. The policy does not extend to shoppers carrying concealed firearms.\n\nIn a memo to employees Tuesday, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said that the company will discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition, handgun ammunition, and handgun sales in Alaska (the only state where Walmart sells handguns.)\n\n\"We know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand,\" McMillon said. \"As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.\"\n\nRead more: I tried to buy a gun at Walmart twice, and roadblocks left me empty-handed both times\n\nWalmart has been criticized for selling both guns and ammunition used in a number of recent deadly shootings, even as the company has gradually tightened its policies on sales over the years. It stopped selling handguns in the US (except Alaska) two decades ago, and ceased sales of assault-style rifles in 2015.\n\nThe company is responsible for 2% of firearm sales in the US and 20% of ammunition sales, McMillon said in August.\n\n\"There have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers,\" McMillon said.\n\nHe continued: \"These incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them, so we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam's Clubs in states where 'open carry' is permitted \u2014 unless they are authorized law enforcement officers.\"\n\nWalmart will continue to sell shotguns and rifles, as well as some types of ammunition.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, and Joe Biden said that more must be done to end gun violence.\n\nMany conservative media figures were also unhappy with the decision, and many openly criticized Walmart, including the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, the NRA said \"lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nWalmart has no plans to cease all gun sales, as it has a long history of serving the hunting community.\n\nWalmart shares are up roughly 24% year-to-date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "On Tuesday, Walmart announced it would change its policies around gun sales in response to two deadly shootings at stores in Texas and Mississippi.\u00a0 ...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d7000352e22af4ada50d9a2-2000/rtr3chnl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
