Jonathan opens up about being sexually assaulted as a child by an older boy from his church, saying, \"for a lot of people who are survivors of sexual assault at a young age, we have a lot of compounded trauma.\"\n\nJonathan felt like he didn't fit in at high school, and he took to finding older men to have sex with via AOL chat rooms as a teen. When he left high school for college, he started doing cocaine, and when he ran out of money for drugs, Jonathan began advertising sex for cash. Eventually, he graduated from cocaine to smoking methamphetamine in his early 20s, going to rehab twice and relapsing both times.\n\nPhoto credit: Matt Winkelmeyer - Getty Images More\n\nAlong the way, Jonathan flunked out of college, went to beautician school, and became a hairdresser. But he was still battling drug addiction, and after visiting Planned Parenthood for flulike symptoms one day, he was diagnosed with H.I.V., which was \"devastating.\"\n\nIt sounds like none of this has been easy for Jonathan to share\u2014\"I\u2019ve had nightmares every night for the past three months because I\u2019m scared to be this vulnerable with people,\" he says. But he's come a long way, and now he says that he hasn't done hard drugs in years and describes himself as a \"member of the beautiful H.I.V.-positive community.\"\n\nSo I guess this is a reminder that you never really know what someone has gone through or how far they're come. And bravo to Jonathan for so bravely sharing his story!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He just shared a *very* different side of himself.", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E.4G9O0mw_2rSqtergr39Q--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/d83653df95f8373c29c5cf7a75d04df3", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
