REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\n\nIn its 2019 federal budget, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government has initially earmarked 17.6 billion euros ($19.36 billion) for debt servicing.\n\nBut the European Central Bank\u2019s loose monetary policy and worldwide demand for safe-haven bonds mean Berlin now expects to pay 10 billion to 13 billions euros, a person familiar with the budget planning told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nTwo other budget experts said borrowing costs could come in at 12 billion to 13 billion euros at the end of this year.\n\nFrom January to June, German borrowing costs reached only 4.9 billion euros, a Finance Ministry document showed. Berlin actually made money on its old debt in March, May and June as yields fell below zero.\n\nA spokeswoman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the estimated figures, saying that the ministry would not participate in any speculation. No conclusions could be drawn for the second half of the year from the borrowing costs in the first half, she said.\n\n\u201cTHANK DRAGHI\u201d\n\nThe Finance Ministry document also showed that Germany\u2019s borrowing costs have plunged since ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s famous \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech in 2012, which calmed markets and was followed by an unprecedented program of bond purchasing.\n\nBerlin\u2019s borrowing costs dropped from 40.2 billion euros in 2008 to 30.5 billion euros in 2012 and finally to 18.2 billion euros last year, the document showed.\n\nBudget lawmaker Sven-Christian Kindler from the opposition Greens said that since the financial crisis in 2008, Germany had saved more than 160 billion euros through the ECB\u2019s low interest rate policy.\n\nFormer conservative Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and his center-left successor Olaf Scholz should thank Draghi for this gift, Kindler said, adding that the wide-spread criticism of the ECB among German conservatives was hypocritical.\n\n\u201cThe truth is: Sticking to the black zero policy of balanced budgets and at the same time demanding higher interest rates, that does not fit together economically,\u201d Kindler said.\n\nHe called on Merkel and Scholz to ditch their balanced budget policy and boost public investment through new debt. \u201cOnly if governments across Europe invest more, the ECB can change its monetary policy,\u201d Kindler added.\n\nOtto Fricke, chief budget lawmaker from the opposition business-friendly Free Democratic Party, said borrowing costs were likely to come in lower than expected this year.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the possible windfall could be partly eroded by weaker-than-expected tax revenues as the German economy is teetering on the brink of recession.", "description": "Germany foresees much lower borrowing costs because of record-low yields, and that could create a windfall of roughly 5 billion euros this year, maybe more, three people familiar with Berlin's budget planning told Reuters on Thursday.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429038384&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0O1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
