Binance never officially operated in the US\u2013but US citizens could still access the service\u2013and has cracked down on US users who still accessed the exchange, in order to appease regulators.\n\nThe outpost will be operated by BAM Trading Services\u2014a newly launched company with little information known about it\u2014and run by Coley, who was previously an executive at Ripple.\n\nAs part of the deal with regulators, customers will have to pass stringent know-your-customer (KYC) checks to use the exchange. New accounts will require a valid government ID and a social security number.\n\nIn a blog post August 9, Binance US said that it\u2019s considering listing 30 tokens on its exchange, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance\u2019s native token, BNB.\n\nBinance US is still finalizing the list of states it\u2019ll be available in, but we know that it won\u2019t be available in New York since it doesn\u2019t have a BitLicense\u2013the necessary, and expensive, license to operate there. As soon as Binance US finishes working out which states can access the exchange, it will open up KYC onboarding a few days before the launch so that customers can deposit cryptocurrencies and open accounts.\n\nThe news follows the launch of US-dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD Thursday. BUSD has been created in partnership with Paxos, and is backed by the New York Department of Financial Services. BUSD will start trading on both Paxos\u2019 and Binance\u2019s exchanges sometime this month.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Despite its upcoming NYDFS-approved stablecoin, the exchange still won\u2019t be available in New York.", "authors": ["Robert Stevens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qCkU25uPSvew7l5RlFtXEg--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/6a3271e7b95f14d205545ab8160fa725", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
