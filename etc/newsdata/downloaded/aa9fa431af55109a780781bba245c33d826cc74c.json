Particularly if you also have to deal with stigma, stereotypes and institutional bias.\n\nThis is exactly why Marvyn Harrison set up the Dope Black Dads podcast, almost exactly one year ago. His aim was to shine a light on the specific challenges of black, male parenthood, and to create an inclusive community for black dads.\n\n\u2018It started on Fathers Day last year,\u2019 Marvyn tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018I had a great morning with my family and, similar to 3 pm on Christmas Day, it felt like it was over and I wanted to feel a greater connection to Fathers Day and other dads.\u2019\n\n\u2018There is a lack of space and acceptance for emotions from fathers\u2019 (Picture: Dope Black Dads)\n\nMarvyn initially created a WhatsApp group called \u2018Dope Black Dads\u2019 and added 23 fathers he knew. It began as an appreciation of other fathers and soon became a source of support around the intersection of being black, male, and a parent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Marvyn hopes to achieve is an attitude shift. He says that the problems facing black fathers are largely ignored by wider society.\n\n\u2018Many fathers still struggle with access to their children,\u2019 says Marvyn.\n\n\u2018They also struggle with the guilt of trying to provide in an environment which can be institutionally bias and at times racist.\n\n\u2018Parenting is still a matriarchal-normative environment. Having now become a father on two occasions, I have seen how the whole process is seen through the eyes of the mother, and also intentionally excludes fathers\u2019 perspectives at times.\u2019\n\nMarvyn says this can make it hard for dads to form connections and can result in \u2018disconnected\u2019 or \u2018broken\u2019 families.\n\n\u2018Many of our dads find the first two years of fatherhood extremely testing and little support is given.\u2019\n\nMarvyn believes that there are preconceptions about black fathers both within and outside of black communities. He says these preconceptions are connected to the perception of black men and the default roles of mothers and fathers.\n\n\u2018There is a lack of space and acceptance for emotions from fathers,\u2019 says Marvyn. \u2018The presumption of absenteeism and the presumption of anger or aggression as a default emotion for men.\n\n\u2018Masculinity is complex and when it intersects with someone you love more than anything (your child), whilst navigating the black British experience, results do vary. It\u2019s unfortunate, but a truth for many of our members.\n\n\u2018We can really deep dive and discover things about ourselves and our brothers in real time\u2019 (Picture: Dope Black Dads)\n\n\u2018We want the podcast to be a bat signal to black fathers so that they join our private Facebook group, attend our monthly dad meetings, and hear the stories affecting fathers so they know they are not alone.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Marvyn, creating his own platform was vital in order to give these topics the space they needed to be discussed thoroughly \u2013 he says it\u2019s time to properly delve into the issues affecting this underrepresented group.\n\n\u2018Our episodes on the Dope Black Podcast are a chance for us to be heard in long form,\u2019 says Marvyn. \u2018We live is a soundbite world and issues around masculinity, parenting and race are difficult to digest and explain in short segments.\n\n\u2018We can really deep dive and discover things about ourselves and our brothers in real time. I have known some of these men for 15 years and never knew some of the things we unearth on the podcast.\u2019\n\nThe most popular Dope Black Dads episodes The most talked about and listened to episodes were about: \u2013 Our fear of white women \u2013 Having wives and female best friends \u2013 Is there a war on masculinity? \u2013 Surviving infant loss We have had streams of messages about baby loss and the inability for fathers to see their kids \u2013 they are passionate topics which we need to revisit soon. Dope Black Dads\n\nIn the wake of the success of the podcast\u2019s first year, a new offshoot has developed in the form of Dope Black Mums.\n\n\u2018We passed the framework on to Nina Malone who was formerly on Britain\u2019s Next Top Model and has gone on to be a successful business woman and now talent agent,\u2019 explains Marvyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Nina took three years off to have her family and wanted a space to help support her through getting back into work and getting back to being herself.\n\n\u2018They launched the group in Oct 2018, and the podcast in May 2019. They now run many events and meet-ups for mums and their episodes are also featured on The Dope Black Podcast.\u2019\n\nOne year in and Marvyn is just getting started \u2013 he has plenty of exciting projects in the pipeline.\n\nHe has just launched the Dope Black Dads campaign with AXA Insurance UK to encourage fathers to talk about their problems, and this month he will be celebrating one year of the Dope Black Dads podcast at The House of Commons.\n\nMORE: Woman who shared viral sickle cell video makes desperate plea for black blood donors\n\nMORE: Exhibition aims to redefine what it means to be a black man\n\nMORE: Book series explores black British culture from Afrobeats to plantain\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Marvyn Harrison explains why he created the Dope Black Dads podcast to explore ideas of black fatherhood, family dynamics and racial bias.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dope-black-dads-comp-e1571127689183_1571128674.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
