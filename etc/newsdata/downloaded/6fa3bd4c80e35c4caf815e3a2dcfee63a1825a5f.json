But they do not consider themselves victims and those who were then placed had all left France the following week.'\n\nThis outcome is a result of investigations into the surge in Metro pick-pocketing in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile legal proceedings into other suspects, where their property has not been seized in Romania, are ongoing.\n\nParis's Metro became known as the 'Roman Express' as brazen thieves would head towards the Gare du Nord station and other popular metro's.\n\nParis's Gare du Nord railway station (pictured) is one of the most popular in Paris and has seen pick-pocketers flocking here. Franklin Roosevelt, Anvers, Saint-Michel-Notre Dame, Opera, Hotel de Ville and Charles de Gaulle-Etoile were also regular spots for the gang\n\nThe Romanian gang leaders would send their children to Paris and they mainly active during the UN Climate Change Conference-21 at the end of 2015 and the 2016 European Football Championship.\n\nSome were accused of setting off firecrackers to scare commuters and then allow them to sneak into their pockets.\n\nTwo women, who were known as the 'Queen of Thieves' coordinated crimes to then transfer money back to Romania. They posted pictures on Facebook with a baby playing with more than \u00a3300 cash.\n\nThey would work in groups between five and ten and sometimes would hold out a map while stealing commuter's possessions beneath.\n\nAn investigation into the network which operated in this time frame led to the establishment of a Franco-Romanian judicial cooperation to investigate the network 2017.\n\nSix months later there were arrests in France, Romania, Spain and Italy, of most of the suspects, parents of the exploited minors.\n\nSome of the most targeted stations were Franklin Roosevelt, Anvers, Saint-Michel-Notre Dame, Opera, Hotel de Ville and Charles de Gaulle-Etoile.\n\nThere has been a 33 per cent increase in pick-pocketing in Paris since the start of the year, according to police. Some say this is because officer's have been 'distracted' dealing with yellow-vest protesters.\n\nAnd to help curb the growing problem, the RATP network introduced a complaint form, available at six stations, so people could directly report thefts.\n\nPublic places such as the Louvre (pictured) were targeted by the gangs in a bid to fill their coffers\n\nPickpockets: Roma gypsies who dressed in Bermuda shorts and carried cameras as they preyed on crowds of foreigners (file photo)\n\nAnd the gang would have fake identification documents and live in illegal camps on the edge of the city.\n\nIn April 2013 staff at the Louvre Museum in Paris went on strike until police sent reinforcements as the robberies were rife.\n\nA group of Bosnian pick-pocketers made around three million euros between 2012 and 2015.", "description": "A 20-strong pick-pocketing gang which preyed upon tourists in Paris's Metro and exploited children between 11 and 18 years old to carry out the thefts has been locked up for 113 years.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089356-0-image-a-27_1571844736868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
