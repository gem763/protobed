I can only assume that Anomaly\u2019s mum didn\u2019t hear about this crucial stipulation. If she had, she probably would\u2019ve decided against a word that means \u201cone that is abnormal or does not fit in\u201d.\n\nANTWOHNETTE\n\nOooohhh, this must be the long-lost sister of one of my favourite bogan babies of all time: Anfernee! Nothing tickles me more than when parents take a regular name and alter the spelling to make it look as bogan as it sounds when they say it. Classic.\n\nCHARMAYANNE\n\nOK, so you took \u201cCharmaine\u201d and you sliced it and diced it until it was truly fit for the trailer park. Fine. But what is with that extra \u201cA\u201d?! Is it still pronounced \u201cCharmaine\u201d or am I supposed to say \u201cChar-MAY-anne?\u201d Or \u201cChar-MY-un\u201d? I need a Nurofen.\n\nPANDA\n\nNOPE! Not a name. I checked the Big Book of Acceptable Baby Names and Panda is definitely not in there. What kind of surname does this even work with? Panda Anderson? Panda Campbell? Nope. No. Nunh-unh.\n\nSIANNA-MARRIE\n\nWhen you really want to make your child\u2019s life difficult, you take two misspelt names and mash them together with a hyphen. Poor Sianna-Marrie will waste 4752 precious hours of her life* spelling her mutilated moniker to the world (*approximate statistic).\n\nSNOWDROP\n\nI thought these parents had annoyingly combined \u201csnowflake\u201d and \u201craindrop\u201d, but it turns out a snowdrop is a flower. I\u2019ll give them half a point for choosing a name that actually means something instead of making one up, but it\u2019s way too cutesy for a human. Rejected.\n\nmedia_camera Thought Epponnee Rae was bad? Keep reading.\n\nSTARLETTE\n\nOh, dear. A \u201cstarlet\u201d is a doe-eyed aspiring actress \u2014 not exactly a solid meaning to begin with. Add a useless \u201cette\u201d at the end for an extra dash of girlish charm and you\u2019ve completely lost me.\n\nVELVETTE\n\nCan you imagine twins named Starlette and Velvette? I wish it was true, but alas they\u2019re two separate people. I just don\u2019t know whether to pronounce them like the original words or like a Corvette? So much brain confusion.\n\nVIN\u2019NYLA\n\nI truly don\u2019t know what to make of this. Vin is a diminutive of the male name Vincent meaning \u201cconquering\u201d, while Nyla is a female Arabic moniker that means \u201cwinner\u201d. There\u2019s a definite hero vibe going on here, but why are they combined with an apostrophe? Are they the grandparents\u2019 names? I guess we\u2019ll never know.\n\nmedia_camera \u2018She\u2019s upset because you named her Vin\u2019Nyla!\u2019\n\nWINDY\n\nIf you can keep your mind off fart jokes and see this for what it probably is \u2014 a reference to the wind \u2014 you\u2019re probably still wondering why anyone would name a child after such an irritating element. How about Sunny? Or even Rain? Windy just gives me the chills.\n\nBRAYAN\n\nIs it Bryan? BRAY-un? Bray-ANN \u2014 a girl\u2019s name? This is one of those modern inventions that gives teachers permanent migraines and leaves everyone else scratching their heads.\n\nKANAAN\n\nI investigated this one and found out it\u2019s a variation of Cannon (!). I didn\u2019t know either of those were human appellations, but Kanaan is all kinds of wrong. I can\u2019t stop saying \u201cCan-ANN\u201d even though I know I should be saying \u201cCannon.\u201d Me no likey.\n\nKAIRO\n\nOh, for crying out loud. I\u2019m already not a fan of naming a child after a place just because it sounds exotic, but butchering the spelling to make it look more modern and \u201cyouneek\u201d is taking it one step too far.\n\nPLUTO\n\nPluto reminds me of a full planet that was recently demoted to a dwarf planet and a goofy cartoon dog but not a human boy. I seriously couldn\u2019t keep a straight face if I had to address as baby as \u201cPluto\u201d.\n\nmedia_camera Same, baby, same.\n\nPRECISE\n\nThis is not a name, silly billies! It\u2019s a word that means \u201cexact\u201d or \u201caccurate\u201d and it puts way too much pressure on the bearer to get everything right. It\u2019s entirely unsuitable on a birth certificate.\n\nSINCERE\n\nOK, get this \u2026 Sincere is Precise\u2019s brother! I\u2019m not even joking! After placing the unreasonable expectation on Precise to always be right, these parents decided to pressure their second-born into always telling the truth. These kids will need therapy for sure.\n\nTENYSI\n\nIf your brain has been unable to make sense of this, it\u2019s a misspelling of Tennessee. Bahaha! Just when I think I\u2019ve seen it all, some crafty parents come up with this next-level shizz.\n\nTIGGER\n\nAw, how cute! The baby and his favourite stuffed toy have the same name! NOT CUTE. This poor child will one day turn into a full-blown adult named Tigger. I can almost 100 per cent guarantee he will never become a CEO.\n\nTOKYO\n\nThis one was reported to me by a friend who was laughing hysterically as she told me. Her very Aussie neighbour has always been heavy-handed with the racial slurs, and next thing you know she\u2019s named her baby Tokyo! Oh, the irony.\n\nWIATT\n\nI was already dumbfounded that celebrities such as Goldie Hawn and Sheryl Crow had bestowed such an old-school southern name as Wyatt on their sons \u2026 and then Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher named their daughter Wyatt too! But misspelling it with an \u201cI\u201d is just too much for me. I wave the white flag on this edition of bogan baby names. Until next time, fellow bogan watchers.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Kidspot and was reproduced with permission\n\nOriginally published as Best bogan baby names of 2019", "description": "Sorry Wayve and Jaze but youve been outclassed.
