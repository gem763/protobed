Delle Donne, though, said the team feels great despite the commercial flight on a short turnaround.\n\n\u201cWe both had to do it, so it\u2019s an even field,\u201d she said.\n\nConnecticut coach Curt Miller said that while the teams understood it was not a long flight, the \u201cdisjointed\u201d travel still could impact the product on the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect situation for both teams to showcase how good this talent is, how good this game could be, should be,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt may not be putting the best product in front of a national viewing audience because it is not easy. It was a really late night on Tuesday. It was disjointed travel to get back here on Wednesday \u2014 no one practiced Wednesday, that was a rest and recovery day. So you\u2019re going into Game 5 with very little prep on the court.\u201d\n\nAfter the second round of the playoffs, WNBA commissioner Cathy Englebert arranged for private flights for the Los Angeles Sparks and Las Vegas Aces to get to their semifinal opponents because both teams had long trips from west to east.\n\nTravel has been a point of contention within the league, which is subsidized by the NBA. Last year, the Aces forfeited a game to the Mystics because travel issues prevented them from getting into the District with enough time to properly warm up and prepare to play.\n\nWizards guard Bradley Beal wrote a piece for The Players\u2019 Tribune about his support of the Mystics and the WNBA last week. In it, he discussed why he supports better pay and equal treatment for WNBA players, including better travel logistics.\n\n\u201cThese women \u2014 with their crazy schedules, and long legs, and bodies beat up from months of intense hooping \u2014 are having to fly cramped-up in coach, all across the country, just to get from game to game,\u201d Beal wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
