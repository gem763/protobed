Everyone was slowing right down and also blocking the way, so you couldn't really get through. It was pretty dangerous,\" added the Mercedes driver.\n\n\"I nearly crashed a couple of times trying to stay out of the way of the guys that were braking ahead of me and then people trying to come past me.\"\n\nHamilton will start on the front row, next to Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.\n\nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff agreed the situation was also an unintended consequence of aerodynamic changes introduced this season that have made it easier for drivers to follow each other and overtake.\n\n\"I think what we saw today, the consequence of all cars missing the last lap, is just a shame for Formula One and doesn't do any of the teams and drivers any good,\" said the Austrian.\n\nRenault's Daniel Ricciardo, who qualified fifth, said Leclerc had been lucky, but also saw the funny side of the situation.\n\n\"The reality is no-one wanted to be first,\" he said. \"You just give everyone else a tow and not yourself. You bleed a couple of tenths... it's more knowing that you're helping everyone else.\n\n\"I think we should probably just get a talking to and make sure it doesn't happen again because we all miss out and so do the fans. The real winners were the Leclerc fans -- they certainly won.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)", "description": "MONZA, Italy (Reuters) - Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton suggested on Saturday it might take a crash before the sport did anything to prevent qualifying turning into a farce at high-speed circuits like Monza.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
