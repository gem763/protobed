Why not? The Golden State has a long history of electing leaders from the deep end of thespian pool. From Ronald Reagan to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Californian voters actually seem to enjoy casting ballots for Republican actors,\u201d reads a petition launched Tuesday, which indeed is calling upon the politically attuned and aggressive Mr. Woods to throw his hat in the ring.\n\n\u201cAn effort to shake up the California governor\u2019s race by placing James Woods on the ballot is gathering steam. The online signature-gathering effort intends to assist fed-up Californians in taking a stand against one-party rule and the increasing likelihood that two Democrats will appear on November\u2019s gubernatorial ballot amid a Republican shutout,\u201d says talk radio host and conservative activist Melanie Morgan, a Marin County resident who is coordinating the effort to recruit Mr. Woods.\n\nShe is particularly adamant that Gavin Newsom, currently lieutenant governor of California and former mayor of San Francisco, get some competition when election time arrives.\n\n\u201cCalifornians deserve a choice in this year\u2019s crucial election and it\u2019s a mistake to allow Gavin Newsom to cakewalk right into the governorship without a fight,\u201d Ms. Morgan says.\n\nMr. Woods, who staunchly supports President Trump, might prove a formidable foe. He has over 1 million Twitter followers, and his opinions are well-calibrated, timely, frequent and provocative. The competition, however, has attracted attention for other reasons. HBO host Bill Maher has proposed Mr. Newsom as a 2020 presidential candidate, a notion that such publications as the San Francisco Chronicle, GQ and The Hill already have broached. Ms. Morgan is tracking the developments and other political matters here\n\nTHE PROVERBIAL DROP IN THE BUCKET\n\nPresident Trump has proposed spending $18 billion over the next decade to construct the new and improved border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. There is much ado about the cost. But one analyst offers a reality check.\n\n\u201cThat $18 billion would equal just 0.0338 percent of the $53.128 trillion the Congressional Budget Office currently estimates the federal government will spend over that same 10-year period,\u201d writes the meticulous Terence P. Jeffrey, editor in chief of CNSNews.com.\n\n\u201cIt also equals only 2.7 percent of the money the federal government will spend on the food stamp program (the \u2018Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u2019), which will eat up $679 billion in the 10 fiscal years from 2018 through 2027, according to CBO\u2019s estimate,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey notes.\n\nOPRAH WINFREY, JIMMY KIMMEL 2020\n\nAmerica went into Oprah-centric politics within moments of her Golden Globes speech. Practical observers have now arrived, wondering if Oprah Winfrey will run for president in 2020. President Trump himself \u2014 who has twice claimed she would make a good candidate \u2014 declared Tuesday that she would not run, and if she did, he would win the election anyway.\n\n\u201cOprah might really be the Democrats\u2019 best bet,\u201d declares Matthew Walther, national correspondent for The Week who questions the effectiveness of such potential hopefuls as \u201cseptuagenarians\u201d Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernard Sanders.\n\n\u201cOprah\u2019s political amorphousness is, apart from her name recognition, her greatest strength as a potential candidate. Oprah, like Trump, is a post-political politician. Politics as the dull business of governing or even the old-fashioned art of electioneering no longer exists in this country. Political life has been subsumed into the never-ending process of digital media consumption and 24/7 live-action role-playing that has also swallowed up everything from sports to family life to religion. Like Trump himself, who managed to be a billionaire largely because he was good at pretending to be one and marketed his act successfully, Oprah was a prophet of the age at which we have now arrived, the great champion of uninhibited emotion, the ethical pursuit of glamour, and consumption as a spiritual exercise,\u201d Mr. Walter continues.\n\n\u201cI do not actually expect Oprah to run for president. This is in part because I think she is wiser than Trump and a much savvier businesswoman. Maybe the Democrats can ask Jimmy Kimmel instead,\u201d he adds.\n\nRUN, OPRAH, RUN\n\nSo, what if Oprah Winfrey does run for president in two years? The idea is open to interpretation.\n\n\u201cThe question is, does she want to be demoted from queen of the universe to president of the United States? That\u2019s the only question. If she wants to do it, she can do it. She is probably the most beloved human being on Earth. She is probably the most beloved carbon-based life form on Earth. If she runs, she will destroy anyone in front of her,\u201d Van Jones, a CNN contributor, told the network.\n\n\u201cWhat could possibly feel better than voting for a smart, successful African-American woman who gives away cars on TV? It\u2019s like election Oxy! What would Oprah Winfrey actually do as president? Who cares! Only haters ask questions like that. In modern American politics, what you would do just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is who you are. And there is no bigger \u2018who\u2019 in America than Oprah \u2014 aka Madame President,\u201d points out radio host Michael Graham in a Boston Herald op-ed.\n\nCONFIRMING WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the Democratic Party is keenly interested in certain demographic groups primarily because of their potential to become vital voting blocs. A leaked in-house memo appears to confirm that.\n\n\u201cThe fight to protect Dreamers is not only a moral imperative, it is also a critical component of the Democratic Party\u2019s future electoral success,\u201d reads a lengthy private advisory memo released Monday by Jennifer Palmieri, president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, and Executive Director Navin Nayak, obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t try to do everything in their power to defend Dreamers, that will jeopardize Democrats\u2019 electoral chances in 2018 and beyond. In short, the next few weeks will tell us a lot about the Democratic Party and its long-term electoral prospects,\u201d the advisory notes.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 66 percent of U.S. employers plan to train and hire new workers with potential, 64 percent plan to hire recent college graduates.\n\n\u2022 58 percent report their job searches stay open for 12 weeks or more.\n\n\u2022 45 percent have jobs they can\u2019t fill.\n\n\u2022 39 percent plan to hire former employees.\n\n\u2022 36 percent will increase salaries for existing staff, 30 percent for new employees.\n\nSource: A CareerBuilder survey of 888 U.S. human resource managers conducted Nov. 28-Dec. 20, 2017, and released Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
