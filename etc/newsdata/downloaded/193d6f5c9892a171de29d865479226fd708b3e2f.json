(Michael Wyke / Associated Press)\n\nDuring an appearance in Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, President Trump teased that he would like to travel to India to watch an NBA game next month.\n\n\u201cAnd very soon India will have access to another world\u200b-class American product: NBA basketball,\u201d Trump told the crowd at the event Sunday.\n\n\u201cAm I invited, Mr. Prime Minister?\u201d Trump asked, with Modi appearing to assent. \u201cI may come. Be careful, I may come.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, serious or not, come in advance of two preseason NBA games in India next month. The Indiana Pacers are scheduled to face the Sacramento Kings on Oct. 4 and 5 in Mumbai. Vivek Ranadive, the Kings\u2019 owner, is a Mumbai native and the first India-born majority owner in the league.\n\n\u201cOur inaugural NBA India Games will help further untap the enormous basketball potential in a country with a thriving sports culture and a growing, young and engaged population,\u201d Commissioner Adam Silver said when the games were announced in December.\n\nSilver has called the market in India \u201cthe next frontier,\u201d and a talent search is one of several NBA initiatives in India as it looks to expand its global reach. Since 2011, the NBA has signed a broadcast deal with an Indian sports channel, hosted three-on-three tournaments, and partnered with the charitable Reliance Foundation for a junior program in schools.\n\nIndia is a logical target for the NBA\u2019s product. The emergence of NBA star Yao Ming helped make China the league\u2019s biggest foreign market, but, without a charismatic star, the drive for sports fans\u2019 attention in India, where cricket is enormously popular, might be more difficult.\n\n\u201cWill basketball ever take off in India? If you asked me five years ago, the answer would be no,\u201d Boris Majumdar, a sports historian and author, told The Post in 2016. \u201cToday, the answer is that it\u2019s possible, but it will be difficult.\u201d\n\nRead more NBA coverage from The Post:\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\n\u2018Playoff Emma is having some fun!\u2019 Mystics\u2019 reserved Meesseman puts on a show\n\nAfter a free agency free-for-all, the NBA adopts stronger rules against tampering\n\nDoc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity\n\nSpain teaches USA Basketball a lesson about the value of commitment", "description": "\"Am I invited?\" he asked India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an event in Houston's NRG Stadium.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "September At Pm", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
