It\u2019s the kind of tough talk that donors and other supporters of the former vice president have been pressing him to adopt for weeks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey said Biden, who has cast himself as the candidate best positioned to defeat Trump and end his presidency, has actually been too soft on the White House occupant \u2014 leaving the tougher jabs to Sen.

Warren was the first major Democratic presidential candidate to call on Trump to be impeached. She did so in April, well ahead of much of her party.\n\nWith the tougher approach, Biden is trying to lean into Trump\u2019s jabs about Ukraine.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi'Off-script' Trump rails against impeachment, Democrats at feisty rally Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Planned Parenthood charges into 2020 | PhRMA CEO warns against Pelosi drug pricing bill | Medicaid work requirements costing states millions On The Money: Trump to meet China's vice premier during trade talks | Appeals court says Deutsche Bank doesn't have Trump's tax returns | House Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey to retire MORE (D-Calif.) backed a House impeachment inquiry as it became public knowledge that Trump has pressured Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who had done work for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThis has put Biden at the center of the impeachment inquiry, and has led to new criticisms of the former vice president by Trump and his allies.\n\nOn Wednesday in a blistering address in New Hampshire, Biden tore into Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president, period,\u201d Biden said, alluding to the increasingly close horse race with Warren. \u201cHe\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d\n\nTrump \u201cbetrayed the nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nSources close to Biden\u2019s campaign say the former vice president will lean into that message at next week\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThe Biden you've been seeing in recent days is the Biden you'll see on stage,\u201d one ally said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to prove to everyone why he\u2019s the only person on that stage who can take on Trump.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also wants to project the idea that their candidate is on Trump\u2019s mind because he is the only Democrat that Trump thinks can actually beat him.\n\nIn a race that has constantly been dominated by the idea that Democrats at all costs want to nominate a candidate who they think will beat Trump, the Biden team thinks this remains his strongest calling card.\n\n\u201cJoin the campaign that beats Trump,\u201d a new Biden ad out this week says after a montage of clips showing the president mentioning Biden.\n\nSome Democrats, however, say Biden\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric may be too late to hold back Warren.\n\n\u201cI am shocked it has taken his campaign this long to swing a heavy bat at what is by all appearances to be a softball down the middle,\u201d said Democratic strategist Michael Trujillo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said Biden should have been pressing this message from the day the Ukraine story burst into the public consciousness.\n\n\u201cWhy wasn't this his response immediately? Most campaigns would view this as a gift from a bumbling Donald Trump, but it seemed like the Biden campaign didn't know how to respond,\u201d Trujillo said.\n\nBasil Smikle, the former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, said Biden backed impeachment after he had \u201cpolitical cover to take this position.\u201d Polls how show moderate Democrats are increasingly growing warmer to the idea.\n\nBacking impeachment months after his top rival could give Warren an opening.\n\n\u201cBiden delivered a strong message about accountability and putting an end to the chaos that I\u2019m sure his supporters liked but it remains to be seen how his primary opponents on the debate stage will handle his belated support for impeachment,\u201d Smikle said.\n\nBiden allies say the only thing missing from Biden\u2019s campaign in recent months was more assertiveness on his part.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a guy who will do anything to be elected president again,\u201d one Democratic donor said. \u201cBiden just has to continue to prove that he won\u2019t take any shit from him.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden is increasing his public criticism of President Trump, betting a tougher tone will help end his decline in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_100919getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
