Now there is a new source to consider about the 40th president.\n\nThe Raab Collection, a leading national dealer in historical documents, has revealed newly discovered private correspondence from Reagan \u2014 a collection the organization deems \u201cBehind the Oval Office Doors.\u201d\n\nThe collection includes never-before-seen letters about press bias, information leakers, religion, support for Israel, women \u2014 including then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain \u2014 the Challenger disaster and space travel by civilians. That pesky press bias was certainly an issue Reagan addressed in the collection of letters, all written to a close friend, the late Douglas Morrow, an Academy Award-winning Hollywood screenwriter and film producer.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that Bill Moyers on the CBS special presented a totally dishonest report on poverty. We can refute every heart-rendering experience he portrayed as being the result of our economic program \u2014 they weren\u2019t,\u201d Reagan wrote to his friend on April 26, 1982.\n\n\u201cLike Jimmy Durante, \u2018I\u2019ve got a million\u2019 of those examples of press dishonesty,\u201d he said in another letter about a year later.\n\nThe president also revealed his simple strategy for dealing with the competition during partisan combat.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats show signs of marshalling their forces to resist our efforts. So we\u2019ll take our case to the people,\u201d he noted on Jan. 7, 1985.\n\nThere is also some candid wisdom about feminism \u2014 with a revealing hint of Reagan\u2019s personal civility included. He did not spell out the word \u201cdamn\u201d in the letter itself.\n\n\u201cAll of this talk of some women about equality is foolish. The plain truth is that they are superior. I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t mind a d\u2014m bit that they are. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s rather comforting. During the recent Summit one of our members \u2014 leader of one of the seven nations \u2014 gave Margaret Thatcher a bad time. Later I said to her that he was certainly out of line and shouldn\u2019t have talked to her that way. She pleasantly and calmly said, \u2018Oh women know when men are being childish,\u2019\u201d the Gipper observed in another communique.\n\nThe letters show a side of Reagan reserved for close friends and political allies, including one note drafted and signed \u201cAboard Air Force One,\u201d a \u201cremarkable rarity\u201d according to the dealer. The collection has never been offered for sale and most of the letters have been \u201cout of the reach\u201d of the public or scholars.\n\n\u201cIt is very rare to find such an important and revealing trove of letters of a president. These letters are a window into Reagan the person and the politician,\u201d says Nathan Raab, principal at the Raab Collection and author of the upcoming book \u201cThe Hunt for History: On the Trail of the World\u2019s Lost Treasuresfrom the Letters of Lincoln, Churchill, and Einstein to the Secret Recordings Onboard JFK\u2019s Air Force One.\u201d\n\nThe Reagan letter collection, Mr. Raab says, is valued at $200,000.\n\nMONICA LEWINSKY, HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER\n\nSome significant news about Monica Lewinsky, who has just joined forces with HBO Max, a video on-demand service from WarnerMedia Entertainment set to launch in early 2020.\n\n\u201cThe former Clinton impeachment figure-turned-activist will executive produce a documentary called \u201815 Minutes of Shame\u2019 along with director Max Joseph. Both will also appear on camera as they take an in-depth look at the \u2018public shaming epidemic in our culture\u2019 \u2014 and people\u2019s collective need to destroy one another,\u201d writes Rick Porter, an analyst for the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHBO calls Ms. Lewinsky \u201can anti-bullying activist with unparalleled authority,\u201d and a perfect partner for the project.\n\n\u201c\u201815 Minutes of Shame\u2019 will feature well-known names as it takes an irreverent, roller-coaster ride through the world of public shaming. It will include subjects from around the world who have been publicly shamed and also explore the bullies, bystanders, media members, psychologists and experts in between,\u201d HBO advised the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nFOREVER AND EVER\n\nWith 2020 bearing down on the nation, the U.S. Postal Service has revealed several of the new Forever stamps and others to be issued in the new year.\n\n\u201cThese miniature works of art offer something for everyone interested in American history and culture,\u201d says William Gicker, acting executive director for U.S. Postal Service Stamp Services. \u201cFrom notable figures such as golf legend Arnold Palmer and esteemed journalist Gwen Ifill to the cultural phenomenon of hip hop to a celebration of the great outdoors, this program is wide-ranging and adds to the history of our great nation as recorded through the U.S. stamp program.\u201d\n\nAlso on the list of new stamp designs: There\u2019s a classy image of the historic Mayflower, arriving in Plymouth Harbor 400 years ago. The 19th Amendment gets a nod, and there\u2019s an ornate \u201cThank You\u201d stamp for the grateful letter writers. Earth Day and the 200th anniversary of Maine statehood will also be celebrated, along with a fancy flower corsage \u2014 an image which adorns a new 2-ounce Forever stamp meant for heavy wedding invitations and oversized greeting cards.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFox News continues to be the most watched cable network of all throughout the day for the 41st week in a row, according to Nielsen Media Research. As far as its news competition, Fox News still leads the pack as it has done for over 17 years, drawing 2.7 million viewers compared to 2 million for CNN and 1.8 million for MSNBC.\n\nPresentations of \u201cHannity,\u201d \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and \u201cThe Five\u201d made up 16 of the top 40 cable telecasts in total viewers. And a special citation for primetime host Sean Hannity, who drew over 4 million viewers during two nights last week, besting TBS\u2019s presentation of baseball\u2019s National League Championship Series on Monday, which drew an audience of 3.6 million.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 54% of registered Democratic voters say it\u2019s more important that the party\u2019s presidential nominee have a strong chance of beating President Trump.\n\n\u2022 39% say it\u2019s more important the candidate shares their positions on major issues.\n\n\u2022 53% say it\u2019s more important the candidate advocate for policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if doesn\u2019t result in \u201cbig changes\u201d\n\n\u2022 42% say it\u2019s more important the candidate advocate for policies that would result in big changes, even if they have a lower chance of becoming law.\n\nSource: a CNN/SSRS poll of 424 registered Democratic voters conducted Oct. 17-20.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
