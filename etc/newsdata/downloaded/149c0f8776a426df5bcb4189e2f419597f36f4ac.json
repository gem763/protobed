But I am here in front of my inspirations,\" said Jerome, a New Yorker whose mother told him about this ugly chapter in city history.\n\nHe then acknowledged the Central Park Five \u2014 Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise \u2014 who had been invited.\n\n\"This is for Raymond, Yusef, Antron, Kevin, and King Korey Wise. Thank you so much, it's an honor. It's a blessing,\" said Jerome.\n\nSome of the men raised fists in the air, while others, including Wise, had tears in their eyes. Jerome played Wise in the series.\n\nThe case of the Central Park Five cut the city along racial lines from the outset, with the victim being a young white woman. It drew worldwide attention.\n\nIt took years for the five to be exonerated, and they spent most of their youth in prison. Another man later confessed to the attack.\n\nThe series has had real-life consequences for former \"Central Park Five\" prosecutor Linda Fairstein. Fallout from the Netflix show has led to her being dropped by her book publisher, Dutton. Fairstein also resigned as a Board of Trustees member at Vassar College and from the victims-services agency, Safe Horizon.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
