It\u2019s extremely stressful, it\u2019s financially and emotionally stressful and it\u2019s taken us away from the most important thing to us both ... our family. It\u2019s ran its course.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Paige Mitchell, Nicole Mitchell and Clarissa Hermann test their zombie makeup and costumes for the walk on Saturday. Picture: Tom Huntley\n\nMrs Bansemer, who took part in the first Zombie Walk in 2007, took over the event in 2009. Since then, she\u2019s married and had four children.\n\nLast year\u2019s walk won Community Event of the Year at the Australia Day Awards.\n\nBut as much as the Bansemers enjoyed putting on the charity event, the decline in donations and support made organising increasingly hard.\n\nMrs Bansemer said nobody would take it over, and urged walkers to make the last one on Saturday the biggest yet.\n\nShe hoped to crack the $100,000 mark for total donations to Foodbank.\n\nFood and game stalls and face painters will be at Rundle Park from 3pm.\n\nBest (or worst) dressed zombies will be announced before the walk begins at 7pm.", "description": "This Saturday will be the last Zombie Walk through Adelaide. Its become too much of a brain drain for its organisers  but they want this last stand to be the biggest charity fundraiser yet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/87551c61f044b1c974dd6641183e4ae5", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
