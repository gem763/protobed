The omission is the latest twist in an ongoing debate about how much researchers ought to disclose to the public about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April, Johnston announced the Agriculture and Life Sciences (AgriLife) program at Texas A&M would join the NutriRECS consortium and provide \u201cgenerous support\u201d to NutriRECS. AgriLife includes a beef cattle teaching program, educational workshops for cattle ranchers and promotion of Texas beef to consumers. The Texas Beef Checkoff program, an industry marketing arm paid for by the cattle ranchers themselves, has funded a number of AgriLife studies.\n\nPatrick Stover, vice chancellor and dean of AgriLife and one of the authors on the Annals study, defended the NutriRECS-AgriLife financial connection. He recently convinced Johnston to move from Dalhousie to the nutrition program at Texas A&M, which included new funding for Johnston and NutriRECS. But Stover says the meat study work had been completed before this new funding.\n\nBeef, Stover says, represents a tiny fraction of research at AgriLife.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAgriLife has done $170 million in research in 2019, $4.5 million in beef, half of that from federal sources like the USDA, the other half from industry groups. That\u2019s a small part of our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work very carefully to make sure there\u2019s no undue influence from any commodity group on this report.\u201d\n\nJohnston did not respond to questions about any beef industry connections but defended the study as providing critical information for people about the health consequences of eating meat. \u201cI hope you can focus on the bigger picture, including the science and what the public should know about red and processed meat, so that they can make their own decisions,\u201d he said via email. \u201cYou might also look at the intellectual and financial conflicts of our adversaries.\u201d\n\nBut critics argued the connection should have been disclosed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOf course that institution [AgriLife] is tightly tied with the cattle industry,\u201d says Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and a staunch critic of the NutriRECS meat study. \u201cIt is inconceivable that Stover\u2019s involvement in this project was by chance or because Stover had expertise in this area. ... There were clearly huge conflicts of interest that readers should have known about.\u201d\n\nThe Annals of Internal Medicine says it requires authors to \u201cdisclose all active and inactive financial and intellectual interests related to health care,\u201d though Christine Laine, editor in chief, declined to say whether the NutriRECS partnership with AgriLife should have been disclosed. She said if there was a funding source for this study that was not reported, the journal would have to publish a correction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any relationship between AgriLife and NutriRECS,\u201d she said. \u201cWould we retract the paper? No. A lot of the drug trials have industry funding. Conflicts of interest is just one potential source of bias.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther concerns have been raised about the study since its publication Sept. 30.\n\nLast week, the New York Times published a story that revealed Johnston had not disclosed a conflict of interest on a similar study in 2016 in the Annals of Internal Medicine that aimed to debunk sugar consumption\u2019s association with health risks. The study had been paid for by the International Life Sciences Institute, which has been financially supported by companies such as McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cargill.\n\n\u201cThat money was from 2015 so it was outside of the three year period for disclosing competing interests,\u201d Johnston told Times. \u201cI have no relationship with them whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBesides, he said, that has no bearing on a red meat study.\n\nCommodity checkoff programs are responsible for familiar ad campaigns such as \u201cGot milk?\u201d or \u201cPork, the other white meat.\u201d Collecting $750 million a year from producers to research and promote products, they are overseen by the USDA. These programs are, by law, not permitted to try to influence federal policy. But some experts see that risk in the new meat study, whose title is \u201cUnprocessed Red Meat and Processed Meat Consumption: Dietary Guideline Recommendations.\"\n\nAD\n\nDavid Katz, the founding director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale, said the study seems designed to influence the 2020 Dietary Guidelines. Katz says the study is trying to cast doubt on a growing body of negative research on red and processed meat.\n\nAD\n\nKatz says the Annals of Internal Medicine has always represented the highest standards of medical ethics. While he doesn\u2019t believe the NutriRECS authors are \u201cserving some Big Ag master, they are looking for attention. This is about weaponizing science so it blows up understanding rather than advancing it.\u201d\n\nOne of the study\u2019s other authors, Regina El Dib, is an assistant professor at the Institute of Science and Technology at Estadual Paulista University in Brazil. She has received a Sao Paulo Research Foundation scholarship and funding from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, institutions supported by JBS S.A., a Brazilian company that is the largest meat-processing firm in the world. Brazil is the world\u2019s largest beef exporter, providing 20 percent of total global beef exports.\n\nAD\n\nReached via email, El Dib said there is no financial or intellectual conflict of interest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cS\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation is also a governmental organization that helps many professors/researchers with their professional scientific career and to conduct their research. I received FAPESP money to spend six months as a visiting professor at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada last year, mainly, to assist in the development of the systematic review of randomized control trials of red meat.\u201d\n\nWhether these funding sources should have been disclosed is a source of debate in the nutrition field.\n\nJohn Sievenpiper, an associate professor in the department of nutrition science at the University of Toronto and one of the authors on a study included as part of the broader Annals paper, says there\u2019s a lot of gray area in the interpretation of conflicts of interest. He signed a letter with a larger group of authors that called for the work to be held pending further review, disagreeing with the conclusions and guidelines piece of it.\n\n\u201cIndustry funding can pose significant issues that cloud the objectivity of findings,\u201d says David Goldman, chief science adviser for a new documentary called \u201cThe Game Changers.\u201d \u201cWhile it would be unreasonable to suggest that industry-funded research shouldn\u2019t be allowed, it\u2019s absolutely critical that there be full transparency about this funding and any related conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The nutrition research group whose recent study drew heavy attention for downplaying the risks of red meat has received funding from a university program partially backed by the beef industry.", "authors": ["Laura Reiley", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Food"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KFWPs6-omcnoX66fzp06ufPlKGQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3TLE5DXD3QI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
