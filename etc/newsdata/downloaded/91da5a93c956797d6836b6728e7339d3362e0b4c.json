(REUTERS/David Becker )\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign sent a letter to the New York Times on Thursday criticizing the paper\u2019s coverage of corruption allegations against the former vice president and his son Hunter.\n\nOn Wednesday the Times ran an op-ed by Peter Schweizer asserting that Biden\u2019s actions as vice president regarding Ukraine were legal, but should probably be outlawed in the future.\n\nBiden campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield addressed Times executive editor Dean Baquet in the letter, \u201care you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers\u2026to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by\u2026Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family,\u201d Bedingfield continued.\n\nA Times spokesperson hit back at the Biden campaign, saying \u201cOur coverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company from 2014 to 2019 that had previously been under investigation by Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Victor Shokin, who had himself been accused of corruption. In 2016 Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin at the behest of U.S. and European Union officials, an action President Trump and his private lawyer Rudy Giuliani have condemned as a conflict of interest.\n\nJoe Biden has strenuously denied allegations of any wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Trump brought up the allegations against Biden in a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he urged Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country. Trump is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, who allege the President may have withheld a military aid package from Ukraine to pressure Zelensky to investigate his political rival.", "description": "The\u00a0Times ran an op-ed by Peter Schweizer asserting that Biden's actions as VP regarding Ukraine were legal, but should probably be outlawed in the future.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
