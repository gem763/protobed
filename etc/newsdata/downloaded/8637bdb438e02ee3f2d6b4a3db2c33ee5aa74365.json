Outages this week could cost the American economy as much as $2.5 billion, says Michael Wara, a lawyer and energy-policy scholar at Stanford. His estimate, calculated using a tool from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, assumes that the blackout will eventually reach its planned length (48 hours) and planned size (800,000 customers).\n\nMost of that $2.5 billion will be silently incurred by businesses, since many offices must restrict their hours or close altogether in a blackout. But costs will propagate through the economy. Tens of thousands of families must now sort through spoiled food and restock their freezers. Others will spend money they would have spent elsewhere coping with the blackout. And people who depend on medical equipment to survive must decide whether to temporarily leave town, invest in a generator, or risk going without until the power returns.\n\nOf course, autumn is always an inconvenient time in California, as it is the heart of wildfire season. With winter rains not yet arrived, and any springtime moisture long since sapped by the summer heat, October and November are when the state\u2019s forest and chaparral are at their most parched. This week, the state faces another major cause of fires: hot, arid gusts that can knock over power lines while further drying out the soil.\n\nBut in the warming climate, California\u2019s wildfires are getting worse. Half of its 10 largest wildfires ever, and seven of its 10 most destructive, have happened in the last decade. Since 1972, the state\u2019s annual burned area has increased fivefold, a trend attributable to a 2.5-degree Fahrenheit rise in summer temperatures, according to a recent peer-reviewed study.\n\nAnd while PG&E induced the blackouts to avoid wildfires, it is also responding to its own financial incentives. Earlier this year, a state investigation concluded that PG&E power lines caused the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history. The fire killed 85 people and destroyed almost 20,000 buildings, including the entire town of Paradise, last November. (The utility has conceded that its lines were \u201clikely\u201d to blame for the blaze.)\n\nRead: A disaster of our own making\n\nUnder California law, utilities must pay for any damage from a wildfire that was sparked by its own equipment. But PG&E\u2014which is owned by private investors\u2014said that it could not afford to pay damages both for the Camp Fire and for several 2017 wildfires that it also caused. So it declared bankruptcy, becoming the first corporate bankruptcy triggered by climate change. Last month, it paid out an $11 billion insurance claim over the Camp Fire and other blazes.", "description": "PG&E\u2019s blackouts in California are a bleak preview of the disruptions that will become routine in a warmer world.", "authors": ["Robinson Meyer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19256628826791/facebook.jpg?1570795615", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
