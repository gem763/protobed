The tally is 26 books by men and 14 by women. For winners, the ratio is five men to one woman.\n\nJamie \u2013 a poet whose genre-stretching first book of essays, 2005\u2019s Findings, was a much-praised widening of the growing field of nature writing \u2013 is aghast at the preponderance of male nature writers. \u201cOnly 15 years ago,\u201d she says when I meet her in her home city of Edinburgh, \u201cnature writing was barely there. It seems very strange that this thing that barely existed can suddenly ignite. I hate to say it, but it has been colonised \u2013 by middle-class white men. I\u2019m interested in how that\u2019s happened. And if you understand how that\u2019s happened, you understand the whole godforsaken political state of this country.\u201d The cafe table is being softly thumped.\n\nJamie, whose new collection of essays, Surfacing, has just been published, is not a sore loser. She has never been nominated for the Wainwright because the prize wasn\u2019t set up when her previous book, Sightlines, was published in 2012. And she\u2019s won a bundle of awards over the course of her career, which began before university when she deposited a sheaf of poems on a publisher\u2019s doorstep and saw them published in 1982. But she\u2019s keenly observant not just of the male character of much nature writing but also of its middle and upper-class provenance. \u201cPoetry has got much greater diversity, by a long shot \u2026 So why is that? Is it related to land and ownership? Abso-bloody-lutely.\u201d\n\nDespite not hailing from a literary family, Jamie found her voice early. Her father was an accountant and her mother, a solicitor\u2019s clerk, usually had a thriller on the go but Jamie was more inspired by her local library \u2013 and punk. \u201cI was 15 in 1977 so you couldn\u2019t avoid it. There was an energy to it that was very attractive.\u201d Did that sensibility stay with you? \u201cDefinitely.\u201d\n\nShe began writing poetry at school (\u201cAye,\u201d she says dismissively, \u201clike most poets\u201d) after she read one poet and thought she could do better. It is typical of Jamie that she still won\u2019t name this poet.\n\nJohn Berger called Jamie \u201ca sorceress of the essay form\u201d and, like her previous works, Surfacing is rich in connections and observations that grant the reader new ways of seeing \u2013 from the archeological bones that look \u201clike broken biscuits\u201d in their museum tin, to the Orkney bull \u201clost in his bull\u2019s dream\u201d.\n\n\u201cI did a long apprenticeship as a poet before I turned to non-fiction. People always say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s astonishing.\u2019 No, it\u2019s not \u2013 just read poetry. It\u2019s all in there. Mine and everybody else\u2019s.\u201d But, I can\u2019t help wondering, where does her simile-making come from? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I love it. I\u2019m not always aware of it. If I\u2019m writing something and it just comes out of the tip of the pen, I go, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d\n\nJamie\u2019s poetry offers a vivid take on familiar nature. There are mating frogs interrupted by a passing car that crushes them \u201cinto one \u2013 belly / to belly, tongue thrust utterly into soft brain\u201d. And the swaying seaweed and jellyfish like \u201clost internal organs\u201d that are visible from a glass-bottomed boat.\n\nTo such immaculate small portraits, Surfacing adds the same big themes of global heating and deep time that were tackled this year by the other leading voice in contemporary nature writing, Robert Macfarlane. Once criticised for being escapist, apolitical literature of consolation, nature writing is now grappling with the epic challenges of the Anthropocene, in Jamie\u2019s case via visits to archeological digs in Alaska and Orkney, where ancient settlements have been revealed by climate-induced erosion.\n\nLike her previous books, Surfacing is a collection of what at first appear to be disparate essays. Jamie excavates long-forgotten memories in some, and then writes of two very different digs in northern lands that are as stark and beautiful as any nature writing but also witty and well-peopled \u2013 qualities less typical of the genre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The land is being swallowed up so fast\u2019 \u2026 whalebones doubling as a clothes hanger at the Quinhagak Archaeological Project in Alaska, visited by Kathleen Jamie. Photograph: Erika Larsen\n\nThe Alaskan people are experiencing the climate crisis more dramatically than most of us. \u201cThey are moving the entire village I visited because the land is being swallowed up so fast. The tundra is catching fire, which they\u2019ve never seen before. People who for many thousands of years were living with snow and ice have no snow and ice.\u201d\n\nThe climate crisis, says Jamie, \u201cinevitably sends you back into the further reaches of time. I\u2019m not knowledgeable about proper deep, geological time. My work is only concerned with 8,000 years, which is nothing.\u201d As she writes in Surfacing, today\u2019s global heating is a mere \u201cwarm bank holiday weekend\u201d.\n\nJamie is not a polemicist but hopes that her writing raises questions. She does not like the \u201cnature writing\u201d label. \u201cPublishers and bookshops want a wee ticket to put on it. That\u2019s not serving us well.\u201d\n\nBut she believes such writing can provide an alternative to mega-consumption. \u201cI would like to think of nature writing as a nice little retreat. I don\u2019t want it to be on the frontline. I want routes not to the barricades but to a more thoughtful way, a kinder way \u2013 more compassionate to ourselves and other creatures. \u201cI\u2019m not an activist. Maybe I ought to be but it\u2019s really not where my talent lies. An activist knows what they want and they work out how to get it. More \u2018creative\u2019 people like me have no idea what we want until it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nWriting her essay collections is like this, says Jamie: she does not plan particular \u201ctopics\u201d \u2013 she almost spits out the word \u2013 but lets themes emerge instead. \u201cThere\u2019s a point working on something when things start to cohere. It\u2019s a bit like scrambled egg. It starts off as liquid in a pan and then it begins to clump. At some holistic moment, which is very rare and very lovely, you think, \u2018Oh yes, that\u2019s come together.\u2019 And all you have to do is write it. That doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201d\n\nFindings touched on her life as a busy mother of young children. In Surfacing, those children have left home \u2013 and old memories resurface. Women cannot divorce themselves from their life stages, she thinks: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit silly to pretend that the complete chaos of family life is not determining what you can do. What I would like to think I\u2019m doing is insisting on the validity of women\u2019s experience through different phases \u2013 young motherhood, older middle age, hopefully old age \u2013 so you have a sense of a woman\u2019s life and what you might call deep time.\u201d\n\nWhich returns us to women in nature writing. Many more women have been published recently, with big sellers by Helen Macdonald, Amy Liptrot and Isabella Tree. But Jamie still bemoans the lack of young, poor and non-white nature writers. She believes that they don\u2019t often visit the countryside, but there is still nature in cities.\n\n\u201cPeople are just too put upon, downtrodden, frightened, worried [to write],\u201d she says. \u201cSo if you eliminate a whole class, you\u2019re going to eliminate what goes with them \u2013 working-class music, acting, literature \u2013 a citizen\u2019s wage would enable a cultural flourishing, a human flourishing, which is being squeezed out, especially with the younger ones.\u201d\n\nJamie sees hope in both Scotland\u2019s political awakening \u2013 independence will be inevitable with Brexit, she thinks \u2013 and down an alleyway opposite where we chat. \u201cInside that doorway is Canongate Books and they\u2019ve got a new award, the Nan Shepherd, for nature writing by people who don\u2019t see themselves represented. I\u2019ll be really interested to see what comes out of that \u2013 if there is an untapped voice.\u201d\n\nThat said, she\u2019s still ambivalent about the \u201chorrible business\u201d of being shortlisted for awards. \u201cWho is being served by this? It\u2019s not the writer,\u201d she says. Although one prize win enabled her to buy a new boiler, she felt she let her family down when she failed to win another. Her husband was gratifyingly angry too. \u201c\u2018If they want a fucking drama, hire actors,\u2019 he said,\u201d remembers Jamie. \u201cWe\u2019re poets, it\u2019s not our job to provide drama.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Surfacing by Kathleen Jamie is published by Penguin Random House.", "description": "The genre\u2019s current boom is dominated by middle-class males, she says, but the author of Surfacing prefers to concentrate on \u2018deep time\u2019", "authors": ["Patrick Barkham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0652a721f76a9ab5a79d55cdd8e0e1b1a3d10f0d/0_216_3007_1803/master/3007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff14e1b9e35611265523b9e73adca2ed", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
