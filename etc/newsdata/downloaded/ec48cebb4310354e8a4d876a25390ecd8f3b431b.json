It can't be everybody else's fault,' Keown told talkSPORT.\n\n'I don't care what he's earning to play for the club, it's an honour to play and while you are there you make your mark. At the moment, is he setting a good example in training?'\n\nKeown expressed how he would approach the situation if he were in Ozil's position, and implored the midfielder to work hard to prove his worth at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nMartin Keown slammed Ozil's attitude and commitment to his former club on Friday\n\n'As a senior player I would make sure that the youngsters would follow on. I would graft, I would work, give everything I could. I would be collective and help the group around me.\n\n'I wouldn't be talking about me. He's looking about and saying 'I'm not playing now so don't blame me'. Well\u2026 No. It's about the collective - it's not about you.\n\n'How do we get you in the team now to get you back in the group? That's the next step for Ozil now. The opportunity is there.\n\n'I don't see him saying anywhere he is desperate to play. For me, the oxygen every weekend was to be in that team and I would bust a gut and I want to see that from Ozil.'", "description": "Mesut Ozil, who won the World Cup with his country in 2014, has been out of Unai Emery's first team plans for the majority of the current season, but expressed his plans to stay.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19922106-0-image-a-42_1571488099214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
