After an extended period of testing, Microsoft is making this update available to everyone via Windows Update. Like previous updates, the May 2019 Update includes a bunch of new features, minor tweaks, and other changes.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the Windows 10 May 2019 Update recently, and here are my favorite new additions.\n\nA new light theme\n\nThe biggest new visual change to Windows 10 in the May 2019 Update is a new light theme. It takes over as the default theme for Windows 10 Home, and it\u2019s essentially a white version of the currently black theme that most people use in Windows 10. While Windows 10\u2019s dark mode isn\u2019t always consistent throughout the operating system, the white theme is fairly well-executed across the operating system, thanks to a lot of apps and areas using white backgrounds as standard.\n\nMicrosoft has also tweaked the default wallpaper of Windows 10 so it better fits in with the new light theme.\n\nWindows Sandbox\n\nWindows 10 is getting a new Windows Sandbox feature in the May update. Microsoft is trying to address the fear of running an unknown .exe on your PC, by developing a simple way for anyone running Windows 10 to launch apps in an isolated desktop environment. Windows Sandbox creates a temporary desktop environment to isolate a particular app to that sandbox.\n\nWindows Sandbox is designed to be secure and disposable, so once you\u2019ve finished running the app you wanted to test in this mode, the entire sandbox will be deleted. You don\u2019t need to set up a separate virtual machine like most power users do today, but your machine will need to support virtualization capabilities (enabled in the BIOS). Microsoft is making Windows Sandbox available as part of Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise, as it\u2019s aimed at business and power users rather than regular consumers. You\u2019ll even need to go into \u201cTurn Windows features on or off\u201d to actually enable Windows Sandbox in the first place. If you\u2019re running Windows 10 Pro, it\u2019s worth enabling just in case you want to be extra careful about a random .exe from the internet.\n\nUninstall more built-in apps\n\nMicrosoft has gradually been allowing Windows 10 users to remove more of the built-in apps that are starting to show up in the operating system. In the May 2019 Update, you can now kill off apps like Groove Music, Mail / Calendar, Movies & TV, Calculator, the new Paint 3D app, and the 3D viewer.\n\nYou still can\u2019t easily remove apps like Camera or Edge, but with Microsoft\u2019s browser moving to the Chromium engine the Edge uninstall option will likely show up in the future.\n\nCortana and Search separated\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of the Cortana digital assistant in Windows 10, then Microsoft\u2019s latest May 2019 Update has some new options for you. Microsoft is now decoupling search and Cortana in the Windows 10 task bar, allowing voice queries to be handled separately to typing in a search box to find documents and files.\n\nWindows 10 will now direct you toward a built-in search experience for text queries, while Cortana will exist for voice queries instead of them both bundled together. The new search interface includes your top-used apps, recent activities, and files, with options to filter by apps, documents, email, and web results. Search is still largely the same, with the exception of now searching across all files on a machine.\n\nSearch is still a poor experience in Windows 10, overall. Microsoft did unveil \u201cMicrosoft Search\u201d last year, promising that the new service will power search results in Office and Windows. Microsoft Search is still in the early phases, but hopefully, it will mean that future Windows 10 updates get more powerful search features so you actually find the file or app you were looking for instead of some random web result.\n\nCleaner Start Menu\n\nMicrosoft is making the Start Menu way less cluttered in the latest Windows 10 May 2019 Update. Microsoft has cut the number of pinned apps on the Start Menu and is grouping them differently. This means all the bloatware and crap that\u2019s usually pinned by default is grouped into a single section that you can quickly unpin. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll only see this new Start Menu layout if you create a new user account or you\u2019re using a fresh Windows 10 PC.\n\nA new brightness slider\n\nIt\u2019s the small changes that count, and a new brightness slider is certainly one of those. Available in the notification center, the slider lets you quickly adjust screen brightness. It replaces the tile that simply let you cycle through different levels of screen brightness. If you really want 33 percent screen brightness, you can do that now.\n\nKaomoji (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n\nMicrosoft is making it easier for you to send \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af kaomoji from a Windows 10 PC to friends or co-workers. Microsoft has added kaomoji face characters in the May 2019 Update that are accessible through the same existing emoji shortcut (win+period). You\u2019ll be able to pick from a number of kaomoji, and there\u2019s also now quick access to em dash and other symbols from the emoji picker.\n\nDesktop apps in Windows Mixed Reality\n\nMicrosoft is improving its Windows Mixed Reality VR support in the May 2019 Update. While the headsets were previously limited to running Steam VR games and Universal Windows apps, Microsoft is now allowing Desktop (Win32) applications like Spotify, Visual Studio Code, and Photoshop to be launched in the Mixed Reality app.\n\nThe new feature is available from all apps in the Pins Panel where there\u2019s now a Classic Apps (beta) folder that lists Desktop apps. It\u2019s ideal if you\u2019ve always dreamed of working fully in virtual reality.\n\nWindows Update now lets you pause updates\n\nMicrosoft has finally listened to Windows 10 users and added much more control over how updates are triggered with the May 2019 Update. All Windows 10 users will now be able to pause updates, and Microsoft is even letting people choose when to install the latest major version. Windows 10 users will be able to simply stay on an existing version and continue to receive monthly security updates, avoiding the latest feature update. This is a big change over what was available before, especially for Windows 10 Home users.\n\nMicrosoft is also changing the way it allocates space for Windows updates. Some updates can fail to install if there\u2019s not enough free space, so Microsoft is now reserving around 7GB of disk space to Windows Update. This should mean that devices with more limited storage always get the latest security and feature updates without issues.\n\nSign in to Windows 10 with a password-less Microsoft Account\n\nMicrosoft is aiming to reduce our reliance on passwords, and one way it\u2019s achieving that is through Microsoft Accounts that don\u2019t have passwords. With the latest May 2019 Update, you can now set up and sign in to a Windows 10 PC with just a phone number on a Microsoft Account.\n\nYou can create a Microsoft Account without a password by simply entering a phone number as the username, and a code will be sent to your mobile number to initiate a login. Once Windows 10 is logged in, you can then use Windows Hello or even a PIN to log in to your PC without ever using a password.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s next major update to Windows 10 includes a number of new features that will improve your PC.
