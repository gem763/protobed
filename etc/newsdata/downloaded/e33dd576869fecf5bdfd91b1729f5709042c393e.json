Navy and Air Force provide a dramatic answer.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nThe things that make military academy football unique must be seen, experienced and felt. But there was a moment Saturday evening just a few minutes after Navy had beaten Air Force, 34-25, in a donnybrook of a game that provided a dramatic snapshot of why this rivalry \u2014 like Army-Navy and Army-Air Force \u2014 is so special.\n\nAfter the entire Brigade of Midshipmen had stormed the field to celebrate; after the playing of the alma maters; Air Force Coach Troy Calhoun \u2014 who had sought out as many Navy players as he could find in the postgame bedlam \u2014 made a beeline for Navy quarterback Malcolm Perry, the player most responsible for his team\u2019s heartbreaking defeat.\n\nHe hugged Perry and whispered in his ear for a couple of moments. \u201cI just told him how great he was,\u201d Calhoun said as he headed to what he knew would be a devastated locker room. \u201cHe did everything today. He made some great throws. He was spectacular. I wanted him to know how much I respect him.\u201d\n\n[Malcolm Perry will not be denied as Navy rallies past Air Force in thriller]\n\nThat\u2019s what these games are about: respect, intensity and a will to win. Both teams clearly had it on a perfect early-October day for football. The coaches, Calhoun and Navy\u2019s Ken Niumatalolo, went deep into their bag of tricks, each running reverse throwbacks that worked, both having to throw the football because neither defense was going to give up much against the run.\n\nNiumatalolo, who in the past has described himself as a \u201cbig crybaby,\u201d cried almost nonstop from midfield until he reached the locker room. It started when linebacker Jacob Springer threw his arms around him and said, \u201cCoach, I love you so much. I just knew we were going to be back. Now, we\u2019re back.\u201d\n\nThat started the tears. With each hug \u2014 and there were dozens \u2014 Niumatalolo\u2019s tear-ducts filled again. And again.\n\nSpringer\u2019s comment to Niumatalolo was a reference to the 3-10 nightmare of a season the Cadets endured in 2018, a campaign that included a 35-7 loss at Air Force \u2014 an outlier in a series that almost always produces thrillers like this.\n\nThis was a long day\u2019s journey into night with too many heroes to count, but it was Perry, the 5-foot-10, 190-pound quarterback, who made the most crucial plays in the final minutes as the Mids, who had once led, 21-9, found themselves trailing, 25-21, late in the fourth quarter.\n\nAir Force had gone ahead with 3:15 left in a scenario not unlike two years ago when the Falcons rallied to take a 45-41 lead late only to have Navy to escape with a 48-45 victory \u2014 driving the length of the field to score the winning touchdown with 15 seconds left.\n\nThis was an almost identical scenario. Navy needed to go 75 yards this time. The sky in Navy-Marine Corps Stadium was darkening, no one in the sellout crowd of 37,957 had made any move toward the exits. The Navy offense hadn\u2019t scored since a 20-yard Perry run with 6:36 left in the third quarter. Now, he had to find a way take his team the length of the field.\n\n\u201cMalcolm\u2019s such a tough kid,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cHe just willed us to the finish. We just figured, we\u2019d give him the ball and ride him to the end.\u201d\n\nIt was Perry who found C.J. Williams for a 32-yard completion after a holding penalty had put the Mids in a second-and-20 hole on their own 33. It was Perry who squeezed forward on fourth-and-1 from the Air Force 15 and picked up the first down by half the length of the football with 42 seconds left. It was Perry, on the next play, who dropped to throw, found no one open and sprinted right, tiptoeing down the sideline until he took a huge hit from 6-foot-5 inch, 270 pound defensive end Jordan Jackson as he reached the 3.\n\nNiumatalolo and Navy offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper have pleaded with Perry to avoid hits whenever he can \u2014 go down or step out rather than plow into a defender. Perry could have stepped out of bounds at the 5, but he wanted every yard possible. He put his head down and plowed into Jackson, whose hit sent Perry somersaulting into the air. He looked like a high-jumper as he came down, but scrambled to his feet and raced back to his team\u2019s huddle.\n\n\u201cI told him he was going to be hurting tonight,\u201d Jasper said later with a laugh. \u201cBut that this time it was worth it.\u201d\n\nOne play later, Perry bolted into the end zone with 23 ticks left to give the Mids the lead for good, 28-25. Three Air Force incompletions later, quarterback Donald Hammond III, who was almost as good as Perry, tried to set up a multilateral play, but the ball came loose as receiver Geraud Sanders tried to pick it up and Navy\u2019s Tony Brown scooped it up and raced 8 yards for a meaningless score.\n\nBy then, as Air Force lined up for the final play, Niumatalolo was on his knees, looking for any help he could to get to the finish line.\n\nHis voice was hoarse and choked by the time he got enough quiet in the locker room to address his team. \u201cI love you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I call you all sort of crazy names, but I\u2019ll keep doing it for moments like this. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for \u2014 for this.\u201d\n\nHe talked for a couple of more minutes and then finished by saying, \u201cI always tell you guys to look ahead to next week and not go too crazy, but you know what? Screw it \u2014 let\u2019s enjoy this one!\u201d\n\nPerry will get the headlines \u2014 and deservedly so. But if there was ever a team victory in a team game, this was it. Both teams were desperate to win. Navy now has a chance to win the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy for the first time since 2015. Air Force will have to wait another year for a shot at getting back the trophy academy players covet most.\n\nIt could easily have gone the other way. It could have been Niumatalolo seeking out Hammond \u2014 as he surely would have \u2014 to congratulate him. Instead, it was Calhoun seeking out Perry \u2014 one overjoyed and sore, the other brokenhearted.\n\nThat\u2019s the way these games often end \u2014 with overwhelming joy and overwhelming heartbreak. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Saturday evening in Navy-Marine Corps Stadium was exactly that.\n\nFor everyone.\n\nFor more by John Feinstein, visit washingtonpost.com/feinstein.", "description": "On a perfect October day for football, both teams showed what these games are about \u2014 respect, intensity and a will to win.", "authors": ["John Feinstein", "October At Pm", "John Feinstein Is A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post", "Also Provides Commentary For The Golf Channel", "National Public Radio."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LGN9srT2JLNYpCzj2t7ICnDKH60=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W4LZTPHH2AI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
