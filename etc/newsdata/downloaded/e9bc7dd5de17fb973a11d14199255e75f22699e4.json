REUTERS\n\nCentral party control, so loathed by modern Corbynites during the Blair years, has been deployed ruthlessly under Corbyn. This latest move may be talked about it terms of democracy and legitimacy, but it's really about consolidating the left\u2019s grip on the levers of power. Whatever replaces Labour Students will probably fulfil the current organisation\u2019s principle function: turning out hoards of keen volunteers during elections. The only reason non-students care about the fate of Labour Students is that, in its current form, it either benefits or harms the faction of the party they ally with \u2013 and the individuals their faction then sets up for plum political careers. (Labour Students was instrumental in the early careers of Tom Watson and Peter Mandelson.)\n\nThis raises an important question: why the urgency to scrap this organisation right now?\n\nThe decision clashes with one taken at the same meeting not to devolve reselection powers to Wales, as well as the rather cavalier decision (considering there's a general election on the horizon) to forge ahead with trigger ballots and selection freezes. These decisions have no internal coherence \u2013 unless they are seen as a bid to maintain the left faction\u2019s grip on internal power. Recent internal votes have dutifully elected a slate of left candidates every time; there is little doubt this will now continue in the short term.\n\nYet the numbers participating in these internal Labour elections have reduced sharply, which may indicate a dropping off of enthusiasm among the membership for such internal fights. If Corbyn stumbles at the forthcoming general election, and Labour loses seats, that lack of enthusiasm could increase rapidly.\n\nThe real problem is that Labour is not really offering any alternative. While think tanks such as IPPR (which is still quite close to Corbyn, and even closer to John McDonnell) is still producing important policy work, there doesn't seem to be much new thinking on the moderate wing of the party. Just tactical battles, which they keep losing.\n\nCorbynism may be waning, but it won't go anywhere without a replacement. The question is still what will that be, and who has the impetus to offer it. The left may be nervous about losing its grip on power, but the moderates have not yet shown they understand what it will take to win the Labour party back.\n\nThere is a vacuum forming. Watching who works out how to fill that will be far more interesting and important to the future of our politics than who runs the next incarnation of Labour Students.", "description": "Student politics barely matter to most students and really shouldn\u2019t matter to anyone more than two years out of university or college.
