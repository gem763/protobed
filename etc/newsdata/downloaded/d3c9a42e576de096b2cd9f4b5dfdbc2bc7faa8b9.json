It is unclear how many Russian captives Ukraine is holding.\n\nConflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed forces has killed an estimated 13,000 people in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Although a ceasefire deal ended major conflict there in 2015, small-scale clashes still occur regularly.\n\nPutin told an economic forum in Russia's Far East on Thursday that it had been difficult to decide which individuals should be exchanged, but that \"on the grounds of humanity we are about to complete the talks that we have.\"\n\n\"We will finalise our talks on the exchange, and I think it will be rather large-scale, and also it will be a good step forward towards the normalisation (of relations).\"\n\nThe comments by Putin at an economic forum in Vladivostok came after a Ukrainian court on Thursday released Volodymyr Tsemakh, whom Ukraine's security service has identified as a former commander of Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDutch prosecutors investigating the downing of Flight MH17 over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists in 2014 have urged Kiev not to allow Tsemakh to travel to Russia.
