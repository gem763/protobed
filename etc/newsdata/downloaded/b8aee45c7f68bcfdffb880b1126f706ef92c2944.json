We didn\u2019t do that and I\u2019ve got to stand by what I said.\u201d\n\nRugby Australia released a statement on Sunday evening, with CEO Raelene Castle thanking Cheika for his work.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Rugby Australia, I want to thank Michael for his dedication and service to the role of Wallabies Head Coach since taking up the position in 2014,\u201d she said in the statement.\n\n\u201cMichael is a passionate and experienced coach who worked tirelessly to get the best out his players. He cares deeply about the Wallabies and the game of Rugby, and always set out with the aim of making Wallabies fans proud of the team\u2019s performances.\n\n\u201cMichael came into the role at a turbulent time, and experienced immediate success by taking the Wallabies to a World Cup Final after only one year in the job. He was later given the ultimate recognition for that achievement by being named World Rugby Coach of the Year.\n\n\u201cNow that the Wallabies have exited the tournament, Rugby Australia\u2019s Director of Rugby, Scott Johnson will lead a thorough review of the Rugby World Cup campaign and the 2019 season.\n\n\u201cThis is an important process which is undertaken at the completion of each tournament or series and this review will examine all aspects of the Wallabies program, from coaching to physical preparation, player fitness, and skill development.\n\n\u201cAs expected at the end of a Rugby World Cup year, there are a handful of senior players leaving the Wallabies program and coaching staff coming off contract ahead of next year. There has already been much work completed in preparing for the future in this regard, and that work will also continue until the end of the year.\u201d\n\nCheika leaves with a win percentage of exactly 50%, losing 32 and drawing two of his 68 games in charge.\n\nDave Rennie, currently in charge of the Glasgow Warriors and highly rated for his work with the Chiefs in his native New Zealand, is among the contenders for the role.", "description": "Michael Cheika has quit as Australia\u00a0coach following their exit from the Rugby World Cup.
