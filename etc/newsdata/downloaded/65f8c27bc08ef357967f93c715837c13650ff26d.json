The French are known for their cheese or fromage. From brie to Gaperon cheese enthusiasts are sure to have their palate preference appealed to. Its temperate climate, ample rainfall, availability of farmland and the commitment of farmers make France a sustainable dairy-producing country.\n\nEiffel Tower - It is not a truly French experience without mentioning its icon. Standing a whopping 324m high, this 19th century creation was built as part of preparations for the World's Fair of 1889. The tower was selected from among 107 projects and was the brainchild of Gustave Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre, an architect.\n\nArc de Triomphe - Be sure to swing by this triumphant historic monument. From the top of the panoramic terrace, your eyes sweep over the whole of Paris. The Arc, built from architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin's concept, was inspired by the Roman Arch of Titus in a single arch. However, it went beyond it by exceptional dimensions (about 50 m high, 45 m long and 22 m wide) and abandoned columns altogether.\n\nThe Louvre - Visit this iconic museum that's home to the Mona Lisa. Take a trip through the 17th and 18th century society and keep your eyes peeled for the other iconic treasures you can find. Some top works include: Michelangelo's Dying Slave, Venus de Milo and the Great Sphinx of Tanis.\n\nNotre-Dame de Paris - This movie-famous cathedral is one to behold. Featured in the beloved children class: The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, we've all come to know its name, but not what it really looks like. The cathedral runs thick with Gothic Medieval architecture styling and looks like something that is rightly fit for a Disney fairytale. With tall towers that point up from intricately designed building faces and an interior to match with beautiful ceiling-high arches.\n\nWhat to do\n\nGo on a romantic river cruise", "description": "Some quick facts you need to know for your French escape.", "authors": ["- Saara Mowlana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7630/491de362b08d43ea861830971663f848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-16"}
