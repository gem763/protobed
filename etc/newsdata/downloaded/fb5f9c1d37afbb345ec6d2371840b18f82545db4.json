They have two children, George, 26, and Kate, 23. She is a yoga teacher.\n\nLIFE-LONG PROBIOTICS\n\nWhen I was 30, I was feeling sluggish and run down, so I went to see a nutritionist. She recommended Garden of Life Primal Defense Probiotic Formula supplements (\u00a339.78, amazon.co.uk). I\u2019ve been taking them every day since. They use a blend of 12 probiotics, to help maintain a healthy immune system. It\u2019s expensive, but if I miss a day, the symptoms come back and I feel poorly again.\n\nLONG HAIR REGIME\n\nMy hair is the longest it\u2019s ever been. I put it down to the Solgar Skin, Nails and Hair tablets I take daily (\u00a312.99, holland andbarrett.com). It\u2019s a strengthening elixir of vitamin C, zinc and copper. I\u2019ve also switched to a Dyson Supersonic hair dryer (\u00a3299.99, dyson.co.uk). It keeps the hair in better condition, as it adapts the temperature if it gets too hot.\n\nJulie Bailey, 53, (pictured) from Harpenden, Herts, revealed how a combination of natural skincare treatments and yoga helps to keep her youthful\n\nNATURAL SKINCARE\n\nI\u2019ve noticed my skin has really dropped with age \u2014 but I still want to go down a natural route. So, instead of Botox, I get a CACI non-surgical \u2018face lift\u2019 every month (\u00a351.50, lavenderandstonebeauty rooms.co.uk). It\u2019s non-invasive and uses electrical impulses to lift and tone the muscles. I also swear by de Mamiel Intense Nurture Antioxidant Elixir (\u00a388, demamiel.com), which uses natural enzymes to create an instant glow.\n\nCBD SLEEP SAVIOUR\n\nI\u2019ve struggled to sleep well since I hit the menopause. However, Cupid CBD Peppermint Oil (\u00a335, cubidcbd.com) has really helped. I add a couple of drops to a cup of mint tea before bed. My friend recommended it \u2014 and it\u2019s made such a difference. I also write down my worries so as to clear my head.\n\nMIDLIFE YOGA\n\nIn my late 30s I took up yoga, yet I didn\u2019t train as an instructor until I was 50. Before this, I worked in accounting. You really can start yoga at any age and don\u2019t need to be super flexible. I love Vinyasa yoga, where the movements flow into each other, using every part of the body. It\u2019s good for beginners. I do it for ten to 30 minutes every day. Yoga has changed my life: I am stronger, more patient and caring because of it.\n\nDo you look good for your age?
