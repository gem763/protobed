As a result, public officials and businessmen who stole millions from the City are still walking our streets freely without any fear of being held to account for their criminality.\"\n\nHe hoped that by writing to Lamola, he would avoid having to take the \"drastic step\" of dragging the NPA to court.\n\nNonetheless, he had issued the NPA with an ultimatum and deadline of October 7 to decide whether to prosecute these referred cases.\n\nIf that failed, the City would approach the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg to compel the NPA to do so and make a formal application for nolle prosequi certificates.\n\nThis would allow the city the chance to take the private prosecution route with the fraud and corruption cases.\n\nLamola's spokesperson Chrisphin Phiri said it was not clear what Mashaba hoped to achieve by writing to the ministry.", "description": "City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has written to Justice Minister Ronald Lamola to resolve an \"impasse\" with the NPA over several corruption cases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7698/a69c56946a3f47c996b13c1a56bf84f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
