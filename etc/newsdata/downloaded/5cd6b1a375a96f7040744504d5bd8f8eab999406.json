That has Jefferies analyst Randal Konik \u2014 a longtime L Brands bear, which has been a great call \u2014 concerned the best days for the bath and candle retailer Bath & Body Works are now over.\n\nAnd that could spell more bad news for L Brands just as it\u2019s trying to pull Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s sales out of the drain.\n\n\u201cOur thesis from here on Bath & Body Works is pretty simple... Traffic slowing means less transactional volume ahead. Candles maxing out means that candle penetration is at the peak and the benefit from mix shift of higher average unit retail price products is therefore at the end of the road,\u201d Konik wrote in a new note to clients on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPulling these themes together against the most difficult sales and margin comparisons in retail means that comps will slow and decline soon, margins will erode as well (rent deleverage is a big risk) and operating profits will fall,\u201d Konik added. \u201cA declining Bath & Beyond Beyond scenario is not contemplated at all by the Street so beware.\u201d\n\nFor their part, Konik\u2019s peers on Wall Street have only known a healthy Bath & Body Works for the past few years. Konik\u2019s research highlights that Bath & Body Works\u2019 same-store sales have increased an average of 7% over the trailing 20 quarters. That\u2019s downright impressive considering competition from Yankee Candle, Target (TGT), and sluggish mall traffic. Bath & Body Works has won high scores on the Street for a burst of innovation across lotions and candles.\n\nRemodeled stores have also enticed shoppers into the stores. Bath & Body Works operates more than 1,700 stores in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nLots of red flags\n\nPeople walk by a Bath and Body Works at a shopping mall in Dallas. (AP Photo/LM Otero) More\n\nBut Bath & Body Works\u2019 second quarter had several red flags that go beyond weak store traffic.\n\nSame-store sales at stores and online increased a total of 8%, slower than the year-to-date average increase of 10%. In the second quarter of last year, the division\u2019s same-store sales rose 10%.\n\nMeanwhile, just in stores \u2014 same-store sales in the second quarter gained 4%, slowing sharply from 7% achieved a year earlier.\n\nThe division\u2019s top line sales increased 8% in the quarter, but operating profits grew a slower 7%. Konik pins that profit margin pressure on a stepped up pace of discounts designed to drive sales (not a good sign for a retailer). Those aggressive promotions have continued into the third quarter, according to several photos shared by Konik in his latest research note.\n\nL Brands Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer appeared to signal to Wall Street on its August 22 earnings call that sales and profit growth at Bath & Body Works may continue to moderate into the end of the year.\n\n\u201cStore visits show candle fever is moderating while competition becomes more aggressive, which presents additional risk for Bath & Body Works fundamentals to slow,\u201d Konik said.\n\nMakes sense \u2014 how many candles does one need after five years of splurges?\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
