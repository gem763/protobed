Business Insider Intelligence\n\nSpotify remains bullish on podcasts as a key growth driver for the company, across both the ad-supported and premium tiers of service. While podcast adoption remains relatively low across Spotify's user base, podcasts are driving higher engagement on the platform \u2014 which should boost monetization of its free-tier users.\n\nAbout 14% of Spotify's total MAU \u2014 around 35 million users \u2014 listen to podcasts via the app. And total podcast hours streamed increased 39% QoQ in Q3, thanks primarily to consumption in the US and several European countries.\n\nSpotify makes much more off of its premium sub base than it does from its free tier, despite still having more ad-supported users: Ad-supported users account for 56% of Spotify's user base, but just 10% of its total revenue. Rising global engagement with podcasts could help Spotify increase the ARPU of its free-tier users as podcast advertising has grown increasingly appealing to brands. According to a recent study commissioned by the BBC, self-identified ad avoiders were 22% more engaged with brands mentioned in podcasts compared with traditional TV ads.\n\nPodcast listening could also be driving some ad-supported users to convert to premium subscribers. Although Spotify couldn't prove causality, the company noted that there's a strong correlation between podcast engagement and conversion of free to paid users. That's because users who are increasingly gravitating toward the app for podcasts in addition to music could be spending more time with the app overall, boosting its utility and their likelihood to invest in an ad-free experience as a result.\n\nThree recent developments in Spotify's podcasting library and capabilities \u2014 made possible by its aggressive podcast investments \u2014 likely helped spark greater podcast engagement:\n\nCurated playlists. Spotify launched a new form of a personally tailored playlist called \"Your Daily Drive.\" The new playlist aimed to improve podcast discoverability by producing a selection of both podcasts and music tied to user interests offered in an easily consumable format. Spotify users would be regularly introduced to new podcasts related to their previous listening habits.\n\nCustomizable playlists. Spotify followed up on the success of \"Your Daily Drive\" by introducing a new feature that allowed mobile users to add podcasts to their own custom playlists. The feature offered additional functionality for users who wished to be able to prepare and stream a set of podcasts sequentially.\n\nExclusive, original podcasts. This quarter saw the launch of 22 original titles produced by their in-house production service, including \"The Ringer: The Hottest Take\" and \"The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet.\" It also saw the release of original productions from Gimlet Media, the podcast network Spotify acquired earlier this year for a reported $230 million.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
