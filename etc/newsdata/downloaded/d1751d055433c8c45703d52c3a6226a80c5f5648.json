REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nThe lira TRYTOM=D3 weakened to 5.9205 against the U.S. dollar, on track for its softest close since May, after it finished last week at 5.885.\n\nThe currency, which suffered a crisis last year that knocked Turkey\u2019s economy into recession, has fallen nearly 12% so far this year and 4.8% this month alone as Ankara and Syrian allies attacked Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe intervention, now in its sixth day, has drawn international condemnation including calls for a broader European Union arms embargo and, in Washington, Trump\u2019s threat to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy with sanctions.\n\nBut traders said effectively they would believe it when they saw it, especially after U.S. threats earlier this year to sanction Turkey over buying Russian S-400 missile defenses did not materialize.\n\n\u201cAfter being led up the hill and down on the S-400 issue markets don\u2019t really believe that Trump has the stomach to sanction Turkey in any meaningful way,\u201d said Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Trump had authorized \u201cvery powerful\u201d sanctions targeting Turkey, to which Turkey said it would retaliate in kind. On Sunday, Trump said he was working on them with members of Congress.\n\nBut in Istanbul on Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was quoted as saying at a closed-door meeting with some media outlets that he expected such talk.\n\n\u201cOf course things such as economic sanctions are being mentioned. Truthfully, I see those as quips along this process,\u201d he said according to state-run Anadolu agency.\n\nThe Turkish incursion came after Trump, after a call with Erdogan, decided to withdraw some U.S. troops from the region. On Sunday Washington said it would withdraw the remaining 1,000 U.S. troops in the face of the expanding Turkish offensive.\n\nIt was unclear exactly what sanctions are in a U.S. Treasury order drafted last week. But Senate and House lawmakers have proposed targeting Turkish individuals, banks and its defense sector.\n\nThe \u201cnews flow regarding the military operation in Syria, arms embargo decision from EU and probability of sanctions from U.S. are creating uncertainty for the investors\u201d, Oyak Securities said in a note to clients.", "description": "Turkey's lira slipped 0.6% on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of \"powerful\" sanctions over the country's offensive into Syria, a somewhat muted response that analysts said reflected doubt that the White House would act.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440640005&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0BE", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
