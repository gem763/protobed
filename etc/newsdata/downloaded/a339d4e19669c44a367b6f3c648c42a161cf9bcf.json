Circulator", "language": "en", "text": "Bowser and her administration want to make sure you thank the D.C. Council for that dollar you will now have to pay to ride.\n\n\u201cToday we are writing to inform you that beginning Tuesday, October 1, we will be reinstating our one-dollar base fare policy for all DC Circulator rides, by order of the DC Council,\u201d the D.C. Circulator, a service of the District Department of Transportation, said in an email to riders Monday. \u201cThroughout this year we have enjoyed providing free public transit for District residents as a part of Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s #FAIRSHOT initiative.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMayor Bowser is using Twitter in her fight to keep the DC Circulator free\n\nCouncil members and other critics said the mayor failed to prove the free rides were benefiting the District\u2019s lowest-income residents. They said the free Circulator disproportionately benefited tourists and people who live and work in some of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. The bus system primarily serves downtown Washington and the Mall.\n\nThe fare structure returns as the new fiscal year starts.\n\nIf you ride the Circulator, you can use your SmarTrip card or exact change to pay the fare. The base fare is $1. Seniors and mobility-impaired individuals pay a reduced fare of 50 cents. Children under five continue to ride free with a paying adult.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to still offer one of the most affordable public transportation options in the area,\u201d the email said. Most other local bus systems charge $2 a ride.\n\nAD", "description": "The $1 fare returns after a seven-month experiment with free bus service.", "authors": ["Luz Lazo", "Transportation Reporter Covering Washington'S Metro", "Buses", "Capital Bikeshare", "Taxis", "The Region'S Road Network"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eOGiF_kWHx90_qvzPtgorzm5glg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HAQPSYTSOUI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
