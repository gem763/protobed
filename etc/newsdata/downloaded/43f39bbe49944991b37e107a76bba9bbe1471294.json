Recently, Scotia acknowledged that it was wrong about October, as market prices imply almost zero odds of a change this week.\n\nDavid Rosenberg, one of Bay Street\u2019s most cited economists, said in February that Canada\u2019s economic expansion was \u201cin the top of the ninth inning, with one out,\u201d and then watched robust hiring and a rebound in housing keep the play alive. Earlier this month, Rosenberg put the odds of a recession at 80 per cent, but if it happens, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be this year. The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest quarterly survey of business intentions shows firms expect a moderate increase in sales over the next 12 months.\n\nIn August, the C.D. Howe Institute\u2019s Monetary Policy Council, a group of economists that offers an independent assessment of what the Bank of Canada should be doing, recommended lowering the benchmark rate to 1.25 per cent from 1.75 per cent by the spring of 2020. Last week, the group decided that a single quarter-point cut by April would suffice.\n\n\u201cThe council\u2019s median recommendation for a steady overnight rate in the near term, but a lower one by the spring of 2020, largely reflected its view that the Bank of Canada\u2019s current stance is appropriate for the current condition of the Canadian economy, but that a troubled world economy will likely warrant easing before long,\u201d the group\u2019s latest report said.\n\nThe trade wars explain a lot of the confusion around the economic outlook.\n\nScotia\u2019s pivot followed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to apply tariffs to all Chinese imports. Then Trump softened a little, and now the U.S. and China appear set to agree on some sort of truce. Tariffs and uncertainty will continue to cripple global trade, but the escalation that many feared earlier this autumn hasn\u2019t happened. If the state of trade politics wasn\u2019t a sufficient reason to cut interest rates in September, it still isn\u2019t now.\n\nIn fact, without an obvious catalyst, it is getting difficult to see why the Bank of Canada would cut interest rates at all.\n\nWages are growing at annual rate of around three per cent, a pace the central bank has said would be consistent with a healthy economy. Inflation also is hovering around the Bank of Canada\u2019s two-per-cent target. The economy probably could absorb faster wage growth without putting excessive pressure on inflation, but that\u2019s more an argument to leave borrowing costs unchanged, not to cut them.\n\n\u201cThe bar remains high for the (Bank of Canada) to shift to an easing or hiking bias,\u201d S\u00e9bastien Lavoie and Dominique Lapointe of Laurentian Bank Securities advised their clients on Oct. 28. \u201cIn our view, a global recession would be the main factor leading the (central bank) to start signalling rate cuts. If our muddle through outlook turns out to be right, we see the current 1.75 per cent overnight rate target maintained throughout 2020.\u201d\n\nThe value of the dollar will be a talking point this week. In an unusual bit of timing, the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve will make policy announcements on the same day. Unlike Canada\u2019s central bank, the Fed is expected to cut borrowing costs, which would put the U.S. benchmark rate below that of Canada for the first time since the end of 2016.\n\nCanada\u2019s dollar has gained about four per cent against its U.S. counterpart this year as the gap between Canadian and American rates narrowed. If that spread disappears, there would be even more upward pressure on the loonie, which could make exports somewhat less competitive. Kit Juckes, a currency strategist at Societe Generale, said he\u2019s \u201cstaying long CAD\u201d because of the \u201cpsychological significance to the fact that U.S. rates will fall back under (Bank of Canada) ones.\u201d\n\nStill, an exchange rate below 80 US cents probably wouldn\u2019t seriously harm exporters, as long as the dollar didn\u2019t move too quickly.\n\nA bigger problem is the propensity of Canadian households to borrow.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s interest-rate cuts, and widespread demand for bonds, pushed down Canadian mortgage rates even as the Bank of Canada stood still. Annual household credit growth has jumped back above four per cent, the fastest in almost two years, led by a surge in borrowing to buy homes. That offset some of the negatives of the trade wars, but also rekindled worries about financial stability.\n\nWhen the Bank of Canada opted to leave the benchmark rate unchanged in September, it issued a reminder that \u201chigh levels of household debt\u201d is the \u201cmain risk to Canadian financial stability.\u201d\n\nIt took several interest-rate increases, tighter mortgage rules and years of scolding the public about the perils of excessive borrowing for the Bank of Canada to get somewhat comfortable with the debt situation. It won\u2019t do anything to upset that fine balance unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin", "description": "Kevin Carmichael: The central bank won\u2019t do anything to upset the fine balance it's created with the debt situation unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/poloz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
