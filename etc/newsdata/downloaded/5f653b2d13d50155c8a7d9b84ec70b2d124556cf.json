(Photo: lucentius / Getty Images)\n\nMore than 90 million American adults are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity is a risk factor for such conditions as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes and is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States.\n\nObesity rates have been on the rise in the United States for years, and they tend to be higher in some states than in others. In eight states \u2013 most of which are in the South \u2013more than one in every three adults are obese. Still, in every state, there is at least one county where adults are more likely to maintain a healthy weight than the typical American adult.\n\nUsing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the share of obese adults \u2013 defined as having a body mass index of at least 30 \u2013 to identify the least obese county in every state.\n\nThrift cities: Here are the affordable cities where everyone wants to live right now\n\nSocial Security: Planning to live on the monthly benefit alone? Consider doing this\n\nAdult obesity has a wide range of causes and is usually the product of a combination of factors, including genetic predisposition and the effects of certain medication, as well as dietary patterns and physical activity. In addition to a healthy, well-balanced diet, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion recommends 2.5 hours of moderate activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2013 in addition to two days of strength training \u2013each week in order to help maintain a healthy weight.\n\nThe appropriate amount of exercise may vary from person to person, however, and those who do not want to sacrifice rich, high-calorie foods may need to exercise considerably more. This is how long you need to exercise to burn off the calories from your favorite foods.\n\nOne of the strongest predictors of the likelihood of obesity, and healthy outcomes in general, is income. Wealthier Americans can afford a wider range of healthy options related to diet and lifestyle, and as a result they typically report better than average health outcomes. In fact, the majority of counties on this list have a higher median household income than their home state overall. Here is a list of the richest county in every state.\n\nAlabama: DeKalb County.

Obesity is defined by the CDC as having a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30.\n\nOther health measures, such as the percentage of the population that is uninsured, the premature mortality rate, and the percent of the population that reports having no leisure time activity, are at the county and state level and came from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR), a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute joint program. All CHR data is for the most recent period available. Total population, median household income, poverty rate, and educational attainment are from the American Community Survey 2017 5-Year Estimates. We only considered counties with at least 1,000 residents.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
