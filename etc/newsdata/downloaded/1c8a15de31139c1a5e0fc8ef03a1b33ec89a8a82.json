(Picture: English Cheesecake Company)\n\nPut Biscoff on anything and it\u2019s pretty much going to bang, but this cheesecake seems to be doing so even more.\n\nSince Waitrose launched their collaboration with the English Cheesecake Company \u2013 including a Lotus Biscoff offering \u2013 it\u2019s been receiving rave reviews from cake connoisseurs.\n\nThe cheesecake in question is described as a \u2018Creamy vanilla cheesecake swirled and topped with delicious Lotus Biscoff spread and crumb, on a crunchy digestive biscuit base\u2019.\n\nCertainly not for those without a sweet tooth, but if you\u2019re a fan of speculoos you\u2019ll be hooked.\n\nA pack of two single slices of the cake costs \u00a32.63 (down from \u00a33.29), or you can get a 484g, 6 inch cake in store for \u00a34 (down from \u00a35).\n\nSaving huge pennies on the English Cheesecake Company originals (Picture: English Cheesecake Company)\n\nSince its launch this month, glowing praise for the confection has poured in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne reviewer said: \u2018 I\u2019ve introduced so many people to it that I\u2019m now afraid our local Waitrose will be in constant low supply!\n\n\u2018Best cheesecake I\u2019ve had in years! Very rich and buttery, biscuit is crunchy and portion is quite generous so you could cut each slice in half and share with more friends (who am I kidding, let them buy their own. If they get to the shelf before me that is!)\u2019\n\nAnother claimed, \u2018This is what angels must eat in order to be angelic\u2019 and said that \u2018the rich biscoff topping atop a sumptuous creamy but not cloying vanilla cheesecake filling, with a buttery and crisp biscuit base is quite simply heaven on a plate.\u2019\n\nGiven that the cheapest cheesecake you can get direct from the English Cheesecake Company is \u00a325, it\u2019s also a pretty big bargain.\n\nVegans and those who aren\u2019t Biscoff lovers needn\u2019t miss out, either, as there are dairy free options and other flavours. These include Sicilian lemon mascarpone, cookies and cream, and chocolate and salted caramel.\n\nTo check stockists near you, you can do so online. Better get your skates on, though, as it looks like these might fly off the shelves.\n\nMORE: Topshop teams up with CALM to release a creative new collection for World Mental Health Day\n\nMORE: World Mental Health Day: 8 easy ways to improve your mental health with nature\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Put Biscoff on anything and it's pretty much going to bang, but this cheesecake seems to be doing so even more.
