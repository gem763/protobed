Sailor replaced her mother Christie Brinkley at the start of the season after she broke her wrist and arm in rehearsal.\n\nSailor has had an up and down season but was considered to be one of the better dancers coming into the week. In fact, Monday\u2019s jive earned her three 9\u2019s from the judges, for a total score of 27. That was tied for top score of the evening, while Sean Spicer\u2019s score of 21 was at the very bottom.\n\nTom Bergeron said, \u201cThis has been a complete shock.\u201d And judge Carrie Ann Inaba echoed his sentiments saying, \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d\n\nFans at home were also shocked and took to Twitter to voice their disapproval.\n\nSailor and Val didn\u2019t deserve to be eliminated \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude2d #dwts pic.twitter.com/rddYOqxcOk \u2014 Marie \u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 (@dwtsvalentin) October 22, 2019\n\nReally #DWTS I cannot believe Sailor is gone and Sean is safe. Absolutely ridiculous!!!!! \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c \u2014 Bobbi Rosensteel (@mich_kygirl) October 22, 2019\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t happen if the judges stopped giving 7s for effort .... #dwts \u2014 Claire Charness (@clairecharness) October 22, 2019\n\nEliminations like these seem to occur every season because the show isn\u2019t just about dancing, it\u2019s also about being America\u2019s favorite dancer. And while the truth may hurt some, Sean is a much more popular dancer.\n\nWhile Sailor appeared to be inconsolable after the elimination, she should be proud of all the effort she put into the season.\n\nDancing With the Stars airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.\n\nWatch as Following Trump\u2019s endorsement, Sean Spicer has emotional night on Dancing with the Stars:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
