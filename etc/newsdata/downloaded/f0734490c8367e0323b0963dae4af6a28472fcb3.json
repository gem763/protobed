Worryingly for the England boss, the last time the Lionesses went five games without a win was when Hope Powell got the sack in August 2013 after 15-years in charge.\n\nDefensive errors, conceding from crosses and poor decision- making in the final third have become a reoccurring theme in England's recent displays. But Neville maintains his side are 'working on it'.\n\nBrazil's Debinha celebrates scoring her second after more poor England defending\n\nBrazil celebrate Debinha's first goal, a header which squirmed under England's Earps\n\nDebinha's second loops over Mary Earps after taking a big deflection during match on Saturday\n\nNeville introduced Chelsea striker Beth England and she provided the Lionesses with a lifeline\n\nHe said: 'We have worked on it all week. The players know about it, I know about it, 12 months ago or six months ago we weren't getting punished for these incidents.\n\n'This is a wake-up call, we can have all the possession in the world but football is about clean sheets,' he said.\n\n'It is something we want to stop straight away on Tuesday night and reverse the momentum. I'm not going to compromise on the football I want to play \u2014 it is my values, my philosophy and it is what the players want.'\n\nHometown hero Jordan Nobbs \u2014 one of eight players in Neville's side who hail from the North East's 'hot bed of football' \u2014 made her long awaited return in an England shirt some 10 months on from an ACL injury. Her Arsenal team-mate Beth Mead \u2014 born and raised in nearby Whitby \u2014 whipped in a string of exciting deliveries for England who should have profited multiple times inside 30 minutes.\n\nLucy Bronze of England tackles Cristiano dos Santos of Brazil during clash in Middlesbrough\n\nPhil Neville called on England to be ruthless in the box at half-time but Brazil came out stronger\n\nBrazil's Formiga, the 41-year-old veteran midfielder, ran the midfield for the South Americans\n\nMATCH FACTS England (4-2-3-1): Earps; Bronze; Houghton; Williamson; Greenwood; Scott; Walsh; Parris Staniforth 74); Nobbs (Daly 58); Mead; Taylor (England 74) Subs not used: Telford; Roebuck; Bonner; Mannion; Lawley Bookings: Daly Goals: England (80) Brazil (4-2-3-1): Barbara; Giovanna (Monica 45); Kathellen; Erika; Tamires; Debinha, Luana (Victoria 87) Formiga (Thaisa 71), Marta (Maria 45); Chu (Ludmila 45); Bia (Aline Milene 71) Subs not used: Aline Reis, Leticia, Poliana, Daiane, Bruna Benites, Andressa Alves Referee: Riem Hussein Attendance: 29,238\n\nBut despite countless opportunities Neville's side failed to break the deadlock by half time.\n\nIt took just four minutes after the restart for Brazil to take the lead. After turning Lyon's Nikita Parris, Tamires lifted the ball into the box for Debinha to head her effort under Mary Earps, who should have done better.\n\nHaving hit their stride Brazil doubled their lead 20 minutes later. Debinha's low cross from six yards out took a deflection off skipper Steph Houghton to loop over a desperate Earps.\n\nNeville introduced Chelsea striker Beth England and it was the versatile 25-year old who provided the Lionesses with a lifeline 10 minutes from time. Houghton hit a long ball for England to head home her first senior goal.\n\nIt was all too little too late and Neville later said: 'The challenge is to keep believing in what we are doing. I can take comfort from the way we performed.'", "description": "CLAIRE BLOOMFIELD AT THE RIVERSIDE STADIUM: England were watched by the biggest crowed for women's football ever recorded outside Wembley on Saturday.", "authors": ["Claire Bloomfield For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/17/19337244-0-image-a-2_1570292581771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
