Add Interest\n\nGoogle, in an effort to support environmental sustainability, has announced a $150 million investment in renewable energy products as part of its ongoing sustainable energy initiatives. The announcement comes as part of Google\u2019s Made By Google event.\n\nAs part of this initiative, the Nest Mini Speaker will have 100% recycled plastic bottles. Google\u2019s Stadia Controllers will also contain recycled plastics. Google says one recycled bottle creates enough plastic fabric to cover two Google Home Mini units.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how things are made today, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Manufactured with dirty energy from rapidly depleted precious minerals, to make something that becomes obsolete in a short time,\u201d said Google\u2019s head designer Ivy Ross.\n\nJeff Chiu/AP, FILE\n\nSustainability focus\n\nFor years, Google has concentrated on building a sustainability record both internally, in terms of how it creates products, and for the external environment, by helping cities become more environmentally friendly. This is a continuation of that effort to make sustainability part of its intrinsic product design. The design team is now tasked with strategizing how to halt material obsolescence, make it easy to disassemble its products for components and use sustainable materials for the initial build.\n\nIn August, Google announced its goal of having all Made with Google hardware contain some percentage of recycled materials by 2022. For example, each product will reuse one-third of a recycled plastic bottle instead of virgin plastic. Sustainability considerations must be balanced with cost and manufacturing.\n\nGoogle also pledged that by 2020, all product shipments will be carbon neutral. As it sets out to offset the emissions used to ship products, Google is working to cut emissions as part of a companywide effort.\n\nIn terms of external initiatives, Google created an Environmental Insights Explorer that offers data in four categories: building emissions, transport emissions, general emissions and solar potential. The dashboard is designed to help cities determine which changes they could make to lower emissions, such as increasing the number of bike lanes or installing solar panels.\n\nDigital Trends is a technology news website that publishes reviews and guides about technology and consumer electronics.", "description": "Google announced new sustainability initiatives at its Made By Google event.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/nest-1-ap-er-191015_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
