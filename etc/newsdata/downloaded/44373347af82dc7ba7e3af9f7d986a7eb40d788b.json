The lawmakers said they then issued a subpoena for her appearance and she complied.\n\nYovanovitch, according to a copy of her opening statement to lawmakers posted online by the Washington Post, said she was told by a senior State Department official about \u201ca concerted campaign against me\u201d and that Trump had pushed for her removal since the middle of last year even though the department believed \u201cI had done nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nShe also expressed alarm over damage to American diplomacy under Trump and warned about \u201cprivate interests\u201d circumventing \u201cprofessional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s businessman son Hunter Biden.\n\nGiuliani has accused Yovanovitch of blocking efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Giuliani has said he provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump.\n\nOn Friday, Giuliani said: \u201cI was doing it in my role as a defense lawyer\u201d for Trump.\n\nIn her statement, Yovanovitch said she did not know Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking her but that his associates \u201cmay well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nCAREER DIPLOMAT\n\nDemocrats have called her removal politically motivated.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a brave woman,\u201d Democratic congressman Michael Quigley said of Yovanovitch during a break in the testimony.\n\nAccording to a White House summary, Trump in his call to Zelenskiy described Yovanovitch in this way: \u201cthe woman was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news.\u201d Zelenskiy agreed with Trump that she was a \u201cbad ambassador\u201d and agreed to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe conversation occurred after Trump had withheld $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine to help it deal with Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\n\u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u201d Yovanovitch said in her statement.\n\nYovanovitch entered the Capitol building for the deposition wearing dark glasses and walked past a crowd of journalists without responding to questions.\n\nA career diplomat who also has served as U.S. ambassador to two other countries, Yovanovitch\u2019s stint as envoy in Kiev was cut short when she was recalled to Washington as Trump allies leveled unsubstantiated charges of disloyalty and other allegations against her.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch arrives to testify in the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Trump on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 11, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on a domestic rival for his own political benefit. Biden, the former U.S. vice president, is a leading Democratic contender for the right to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election. Trump has denied he did anything wrong on the call.\n\nThe investigation of Trump could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against the president in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans who control the chamber have shown little appetite for ousting the president.\n\nThe chairmen of the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry warned the administration against stonewalling. Any efforts to prevent witness cooperation will be deemed obstruction of Congress \u201cand an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and cover-up,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\n\u2018MALIGN INTENTIONS\u2019\n\nYovanovitch warned about Russia\u2019s \u201cmalign intentions\u201d toward Ukraine and said that if the United States allows Russian actions toward its neighbor to stand \u201cwe will set a precedent that the United States will regret for decades to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within. State Department leadership, with Congress, needs to take action now to defend this great institution, and its thousands of loyal and effective employees,\u201d Yovanovitch said.\n\nYovanovitch said in her statement that the notion she had been disloyal to Trump was \u201cfictitious\u201d and dismissed the idea that former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration had asked her to harm Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nYovanovitch was the third key witness to appear in the impeachment inquiry. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will comply with a subpoena and testify next Thursday before the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry, his lawyers said, despite the White House policy against cooperation.\n\nBut Sondland is not authorized to release the documents the committees have sought, his lawyers said, adding that he hopes the material will be shared with the committees before his appearance. Sondland was initially scheduled to testify before the House committees on Tuesday, but was blocked by the Trump administration from appearing.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nOn Thursday, two Florida businessmen - Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman - who had helped Giuliani as he investigated Biden were arrested in what U.S. prosecutors said was a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other political candidates.\n\nParnas sought the help of a U.S. congressman to get Trump to remove Yovanovitch, according to the indictment.", "description": "The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on Friday told a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump that he ousted her based on \"unfounded and false claims\" after she had come under attack by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Jonathan Landay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439808699&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1F6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
