Elijah Cummings of Baltimore has died,\u201d by Brian Witte in Baltimore: \u201cMaryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, his congressional office said. He was 68.\n\n\u201cA sharecropper\u2019s son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a U.S. House committee that investigated President Donald Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs.\n\n\u201cAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of the president\u2019s governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president\u2019s family members serving in the White House.\u201d AP\n\n-- \u201cEU and U.K. say they have Brexit deal,\u201d by POLITICO Europe\u2019s David Herszenhorn: \u201cThe EU and U.K. have reached a deal on a new Withdrawal Agreement that will let Britain depart on orderly terms, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today. Word of an agreement came as EU leaders were en route to Brussels for a crucial European Council summit.\n\n\u201c\u2018Where there is a will, there is a #deal,\u2019 Juncker posted on Twitter. Johnson in his own post wrote: \u2018We\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control.\u2019 Full details were not immediately available, but EU leaders were expected to demand a full legal text before signing off. It was also unclear if the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland would support the arrangement. EU and U.K. negotiators previously reached an accord on a Brexit divorce decree, but it was rejected three times by the British parliament, leading Theresa May to resign as prime minister.\u201d\n\nJAKE\u2019S DISPATCH WITH POMPEO -- GOOD THURSDAY MORNING from Ankara, Turkey, where Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO\u2019S plane landed at roughly 12:35 p.m. local time -- 5:35 a.m. in D.C. -- after a more than four-hour flight from Shannon, Ireland, where the plane refueled. It wasn\u2019t public when we took off, but this trip will also take us to Jerusalem for a meeting with Israeli PM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU and Brussels for a meeting with NATO Secretary-General JENS STOLTENBERG.\n\nTVS WERE TUNED TO FOX NEWS upon takeoff. Dinner was chicken, potatoes and cheese, salad and a big slice of chocolate cake.\n\nIT WAS A BIT BUMPY for much of the flight, which was aboard the secretary of State\u2019s modified Boeing 757. (For the record: Pompeo\u2019s plane beat Air Force Two to Shannon.)\n\nTHE STATE DEPARTMENT is, quite obviously, under the microscope for many reasons at the moment. It\u2019s enmeshed in the impeachment probe, as RUDY GIULIANI has been accused of conducting a shadow foreign policy around Foggy Bottom\u2019s back. State is in the middle of the ballooning conflict in Syria, which is why the president ordered Pompeo to Ankara.\n\nTHERE WASN\u2019T A SNIFF OF ANY OF THAT inside this bubble. Pompeo dropped by the press cabin just before departure to say hello. He noted that it is Pence who is leading this delegation to Turkey, and said it is \u201cour mission set to see if we can get a cease-fire\u201d in Turkey\u2019s widening incursion into Syria. \u201cSee if we can get this brokered,\u201d he said. He was jacketless, with a yellow tie, and trailed by Morgan Ortagus, his chief comms official. His demeanor seemed light, and although his visit was short, he did come to greet the traveling press pool of five (NYT, AFP, POLITICO and CNN).\n\nOF COURSE, this mission, as Pompeo puts it, will not be easy, considering that Turkish President RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN has already said he has no intention to sign a cease-fire.\n\nTHE RISK \u2026 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION is sending the VP and the secretary of State to try to change the behavior of a foreign leader who says he has no intention of changing his behavior. What will they get from sending the VP and SecState to Turkey? They do have leverage in the sanctions Treasury announced and the tougher measures pending in Congress, but it seems quite risky for the U.S.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE in Ankara today is a meeting with ERDOGAN and PENCE. We\u2019ll then go to Israel. The Netanyahu meeting is Friday. We\u2019ll then fly to Brussels for the NATO visit before returning to Washington.\n\nMEANWHILE, HERE\u2019S HOW IT\u2019S GOING IN SYRIA \u2026 WE\u2019RE BOMBING OUR OWN BASES TO KEEP THEM FROM OUR ALLY! \u2026 WSJ: \u201cOn Wednesday, the U.S. military said two F-15E jet fighters carried out an airstrike to destroy an ammunition-storage facility, latrines, tents and other parts of the Syria headquarters of the American campaign to destroy Islamic State after pulling its forces from the base. Col. Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition overseeing the fight against Islamic State, said the airstrikes were intended to \u2018reduce the facility\u2019s military usefulness.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe decision to target the base, which included warehouses used to train-and-equip the Kurdish-led fighters, came after Turkish-backed forces moved on the facility on Tuesday.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- BBC: \u201cTurkish president Erdogan \u2018threw Trump\u2019s Syria letter in bin\u2019\u201d: \u201cTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put US President Donald Trump's letter \u2018in the bin,\u2019 the BBC has been told. In the letter dated 9 October, and sent after US troops were pulled out of Syria, Mr Trump told Mr Erdogan: \u2018Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!\u2019\n\n\u201cTurkish presidential sources told the BBC that the letter was \u2018thoroughly rejected\u2019 by Mr Erdogan. On the day the letter was received, Turkey launched a cross-border offensive against Kurdish-led forces.\u201d BBC\n\nHAPPENING TODAY -- Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley will provide lawmakers with a classified update on Syria and Turkey.\n\n-- ALSO TODAY: Sens.

The president, according to multiple sources familiar with the meeting, came in hot, talking about his \u201cnasty\u201d letter to Erdogan.\n\nAlthough the meeting was organized by the White House, Trump said \u201csomeone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it.\u201d Things went downhill from there, with the president suggesting there were communists in Syria so Democrats would like that.\n\nSHOT: As Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer exited the meeting, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the polls.\u201d\n\nCHASER: Trump tweeted a photo of Pelosi standing up and pointing at him in the Cabinet Room with this caption: \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d Pelosi made the photo her Twitter cover photo.

Wednesday\u2019s ugly encounter marks the third time in less than nine months that a meeting between two of the nation\u2019s most powerful leaders has been derailed after a barrage of insults from the president.\n\n\u201cTrump accused Democratic leaders of sympathizing with communists in Syria and slammed Pelosi as \u2018a third-rate politician,\u2019 before ripping a series of targets including Jim Mattis, his own former Pentagon chief. While Trump also makes clear that he doesn't care much for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), it's Pelosi who clearly angers the president most \u2014 a fury that has only grown since Democrats launched their fast-moving impeachment inquiry of Trump.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT\u2019S KATIE ROGERS: \u201cInside the Derailed White House Meeting\u201d\n\nTHE DEMOCRATS\u2019 IMPEACHMENT CONUNDRUM -- \u201cDemocrats grapple with impeachment timing as evidence piles up,\u201d by Kyle Cheney and Heather Caygle: \u201cDemocrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they\u2019re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine\u2019s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cBut as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? \u2018There are two competing pressures here,\u2019 said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Oversight Committee, one of three panels leading the impeachment process. \u2018One is that the president is a one-man crime wave who has generated virtually limitless impeachable offenses and misconduct. On the other hand, we need to develop a process that will close within a period of time that makes sense for the legislative calendar.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut Raskin said lawmakers are not yet discussing how to make that determination. \u2018We\u2019re just not there yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018We really are still in the throes of the fact investigation.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nMCCONNELL PREPARES -- \u201cMcConnell tells Senate Republicans to be ready for impeachment trial of Trump,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Rachael Bade and Erica Werner: \u201cMajority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation.\n\n\u201cAn air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached \u2014 and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions.\u201d WaPo\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

And like other current and former officials who have testified for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, McKinley told investigators he was deeply alarmed by efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cAccording to a former colleague familiar with his testimony, McKinley attributed his resignation to \u2018what appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance domestic political objectives.\u2019 McKinley also testified that he resigned in part due to \u2018the failure, in my view, of the State Department to offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cHouse lawyers: Trump trying to \u2018obstruct his own impeachment,\u2019\u201d by Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney: \u201cLawyers for the House of Representatives on Wednesday accused President Donald Trump of trying to \u2018obstruct his own impeachment\u2019 by claiming the authority to block his advisers from cooperating with congressional investigations.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cRick Perry Called Rudy Giuliani at Trump\u2019s Direction on Ukraine Concerns,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Timothy Puko and Rebecca Ballhaus: \u201cEnergy Secretary Rick Perry said he sought out Rudy Giuliani this spring at President Trump\u2019s direction to address Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about alleged Ukrainian corruption, a sign of how closely the president\u2019s personal lawyer worked with the administration on Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cMr. Perry, in an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal, said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart. He said Mr. Giuliani described to him during their phone call several concerns about Ukraine\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, concerns that haven\u2019t been substantiated.\n\n\u201cMr. Perry also said he never heard the president, any of his appointees, Mr. Giuliani or the Ukrainian regime discuss the possibility of specifically investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden.\u201d WSJ\n\nMORE SONDLAND CONTROVERSY -- \u201cGordon Sondland, Trump envoy and key figure in impeachment probe, faces criticism over $1 million taxpayer-funded home renovation,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Michael Birnbaum in Brussels, Shane Harris and John Hudson: \u201cGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central figure in the House impeachment inquiry of President Trump, is overseeing a nearly $1 million renovation of his government-provided residence, paid for with taxpayer money, that current and former officials have criticized as extravagant and unnecessary.\n\n\u201cThe work on the ambassador\u2019s home on the outskirts of Brussels includes more than $400,000 in kitchen renovations, nearly $30,000 for a new sound system and $95,000 for an outdoor \u201cliving pod\u201d with a pergola and electric heating, LED lighting strips and a remote-control system, government procurement records show. The State Department also has allocated more than $100,000 for an \u2018alternate\u2019 residence for Sondland for September and October, while work is performed.\u201d WaPo\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- \u201cSen.

Just months ago, Biden\u2019s initial cash haul surprised naysayers who doubted he could compete with the money-minting machines that is Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But now the former vice president is bleeding money.\n\n\u201cBiden spent almost $2 million more than his presidential campaign raised last quarter, a predicament caused by sluggish fundraising coupled with the expenses of maintaining a big payroll and a nationwide operation \u2014 one that included luxury expenses such as swank hotel stays at the Westin and The W, and nearly $1 million for private jets.\n\n\u201cHis cash on hand sum of $8.9 million is so low that it\u2019s almost four times lower than the $33.7 million banked by Sanders, nearly three times lower than Warren\u2019s $25.7 million war chest and more than twice as small as Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $23.3 million.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from USAA: Military and veteran caregivers wear many hats when caring for our nation\u2019s wounded warriors at home.

They are used to rapid fluctuations in the S&P 500 index; volatility is common, of course. But the precision and timing of these trades, and the vast amount of money being made as a result of them, make the traders wonder if all this is on the level. Are the people behind these trades incredibly lucky, or do they have access to information that other people don\u2019t have about, say, Trump\u2019s or Beijing\u2019s latest thinking on the trade war or any other of a number of ways that Trump is able to move the markets through his tweeting or slips of the tongue? Essentially, do they have inside information?\u201d Vanity Fair\n\nDANIEL LIPPMAN: \u201cThe lawyer at the center of the Ukraine vortex\u201d: \u201cJohn Eisenberg, the attorney who is emerging as a central figure in the Ukraine scandal, is a quiet and unassuming presence in a White House dominated by more colorful personalities. He says little, frequently keeping his head down as he walks the halls of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. He has few internal enemies. He\u2019s not known to speak to reporters. He keeps such a low profile that, for a while, the president didn\u2019t even know his name, repeatedly referring to him as \u2018Mike.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nOBSCURE SCANDAL WATCH -- \u201cPostmaster general who was target of Trump\u2019s ire announces retirement,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey: \u201cU.S. Postmaster General Megan Brennan plans to retire in January, officials said Wednesday, following months of complaints from President Trump that the Postal Service was losing too much money and should be charging retail giant Amazon more for package delivery.\n\n\u201cTrump had told aides repeatedly earlier this year that he would like to remove Brennan from her post, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. But officials on Wednesday characterized Brennan\u2019s departure as a normal retirement and said she would assist in the search for a replacement.\n\n\u201cBrennan, a former letter carrier who is the first woman to head the postal agency, had resisted Trump\u2019s push to double the rates charged to Amazon and other firms to ship packages \u2014 a drastic move that could cost the companies and post office customers billions of dollars.\u201d WaPo\n\nDAILY RUDY -- \u201cFederal investigation of Rudy Giuliani includes counterintelligence probe,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Evan Perez, Sara Murray and Shimon Prokupecz: \u201cFor months, investigators looking into Rudy Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine have dug into everything from possible financial entanglements with alleged corrupt Ukrainian figures to counterintelligence concerns raised by some of those business ties, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe counterintelligence part of the investigation indicates that FBI and criminal prosecutors in Manhattan are looking at a broader set of issues related to Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, than has been previously reported. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe counterintelligence probe hinges in part on whether a foreign influence operation was trying to take advantage of Giuliani's business ties in Ukraine and with wealthy foreigners to make inroads with the White House, according to one person briefed on the matter.\u201d CNN\n\nHAPPENING TODAY \u2026 SONDLAND ON THE HOT SEAT -- \u201cSondland asked Ukrainian officials during private White House talk about gas firm linked to Hunter Biden,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Josh Lederman: \u201cLawmakers plan to grill Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland on Thursday about a private discussion he had with top Ukrainian officials in the White House in which he explicitly mentioned the Ukrainian gas company linked to Hunter Biden, amid negotiations over granting Ukraine\u2019s new president an audience with President Donald Trump, NBC News has learned.\n\n\u201cSondland\u2019s meeting with the Ukrainians just steps away from the White House Situation Room came minutes after a larger West Wing meeting that included then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, who had been noncommittal about scheduling a meeting between Trump and new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Sondland directly contradicted Bolton by telling the Ukrainians that in fact, Trump was committed to meeting with Zelenskiy on the condition he open a corruption investigation, two people told about the matter tell NBC News.\n\n\u201cBolton abruptly ended the meeting.\n\n\u201cBut, the individuals say, Sondland then invited the Ukrainian officials to continue the conversation separately, escorting them to a private room in the White House basement, the individuals said. That\u2019s when Sondland was overheard discussing Burisma Holdings, whose board of directors former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden joined in 2014.\u201d NBC\n\nNEXT WEEK\u2019S TESTIMONY -- Oct. 22: Bill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine; Oct. 23: Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs; Oct. 24: Alexander Vindman, director of European affairs at the National Security Council; Oct. 25: Suriya Jayanti, Foreign Service officer in Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, senior director for Russia at the NSC.

In addition to being spouses, parents, children or friends of the servicemember or veteran, caregivers also step up and serve as doctors, nurses, therapists, financial planners, drivers and more. In some cases, they even set aside their own careers to care for those who served our nation. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 25% of caregivers spend more than 40 hours per week fulfilling this responsibility. And caregivers are often silent about their responsibilities. USAA recognizes the selflessness of these 5.5 million hidden heroes and backs efforts to connect them with resources and networks of support to help ease their load.
