Col. Alexander Vindman\u2019s planned opening statement to House impeachment committees Tuesday, in which he describes being alarmed by Donald Trump\u2019s quid pro quo offer to the share tweet email save Embed\n\nAs damaging evidence against Donald Trump in the Ukraine scandal continues to mount, the president continues to insist he had an innocuous phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy in July. To hear the Republican tell it, the conversation was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Congress will hear today from a highly credible witness from inside the White House who has a very different perspective. NBC News reported overnight:\n\nA U.S. Army official and White House national security official plans to tell members of Congress conducting an impeachment inquiry that he was on the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader in which Trump asked for an investigation into the Bidens, and that he raised concerns about it. Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, who is the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, considered the request so damaging to American national security that he reported it to a superior, according to his opening statement obtained by NBC News.\n\nVindman will be the first White House official to testify in the impeachment inquiry. He\u2019ll also be the first witness to have listened in on the infamous July 25 Trump-Zelensky call.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman is expected to say in his opening statement.\n\nThe National Security Council expert was so concerned that Trump\u2019s scheme would \u201cundermine U.S. national security\u201d that he reported his concerns to his superiors \u2013 twice. After a July 10 meeting, Vindman took his objections to the National Security Council\u2019s lead attorney, John Eisenberg, after hearing U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland reference a quid-pro-quo scheme. Vindman then spoke up again after the July 25 call between the two presidents.\n\nAnd why is this testimony so important? A few reasons, actually.\n\nFirst, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council will corroborate the testimony of other impeachment inquiry witnesses, including a recent deposition from Fiona Hill, who also reportedly characterized the White House\u2019s scheme as a national security risk.\n\nSecond, Vindman is a White House official with direct, first-hand information about what transpired.\n\nAnd third, Vindman\u2019s credibility will be difficult to go after. He is, after all, a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran who served in Iraq, where he was injured by an IED blast in the line of duty. The lieutenant colonel is also an immigrant \u2013 he came to the United States as a small child \u2013 who speaks Ukrainian.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d Vindman is expected to say in his opening statement.\n\nI realize conservative media has already begun playing its role, and Vindman\u2019s heroic service clearly will not inoculate him from ugly far-right attacks. But for fair-minded observers, his testimony is poised to make Donald Trump\u2019s scandal quite a bit worse.", "description": "For the first time, Congress will hear today from a White House official who believes Trump's Ukraine scheme undermined our national security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/gettyimages-475548666_copy.jpg?itok=yHuVS0eA", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
