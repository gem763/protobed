But supporting the national team had become a farce. I haven\u2019t been to a match since.\n\nEngland's loss to Croatia in 2007 was the nadir for football supporters of a certain generation\n\nEngland lost to Croatia 2-0 the year before and the world was laughing at the national team\n\nNow Wednesday\u2019s World Cup semi-final offers a chance at redemption. I\u2019m the estranged son being welcomed back by his family, suddenly remembering why home was so special after all.\n\nAfter years of attending England matches, the two games against Croatia marked the moment we hit rock bottom.\n\nSome may say that came in Rotterdam under Graham Taylor \u2014 but I was 17 during that 2-0 defeat by Holland in 1993 and still filled with boundless optimism.\n\nI\u2019ve written off six penalty shootout failures in major tournaments, the David Beckham and Wayne Rooney red cards, David Seaman\u2019s flap at Ronaldinho\u2019s cross, Maradona\u2019s handball, Kevin Keegan\u2019s missed header and the countless other injustices and injuries that had led to other England teams exiting tournaments as heroic failures.\n\nHope and enthusiasm had persisted. It was against Croatia where my national pride evaporated.\n\nPaul Robinson missing the ball, leading to a Gary Neville own goal, showed just how far we fell\n\nThe game in Zagreb had been terrifying, but also a joke.\n\nThe Croat fans were passionate and intimidating. The concrete Communist-era stands swayed as the Croats stomped and chanted.\n\nI seriously thought they\u2019d collapse at any moment, instead it was lethargic England that crumbled.\n\nThe embarrassingly hilarious mis-kick by keeper Paul Robinson which resulted in a Gary Neville own goal confirmed it: we were a laughing stock.\n\nDespite that, I continued to attend home internationals, though my enthusiasm was waning.\n\nThen came that shattering 3-2 defeat at Wembley which meant England failed to qualify for Euro 2008. Scott Carson made his competitive debut and his early error spread nerves through the team.\n\nEngland were toothless and brainless. Packed with some of the world\u2019s top players, but not a team.\n\nThen came that 3-2 defeat at Wembley which meant England failed to qualify for Euro 2008\n\nScott Carson made his competitive debut and his early error spread nerves through the team\n\nMeanwhile, Croatia, this nation of four million with a line-up that boasted a handful of Premier League players, showed enviable technical ability, tactical nous and determination.\n\nEngland seemed psychologically ill-equipped to win anything ever again.\n\n\u2018A Wally with a Brolly\u2019 the back page of Sportsmail called Steve McClaren the next day \u2014 a pitch-perfect headline that summed up the night.\n\nOnly, I was a wally too. We all were, for believing England would finally deliver on their potential. Like the family of an addict who keeps saying they\u2019ll quit, I\u2019d listened, believed and hoped that they\u2019d finally come good.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for Euro 2008, Steve McLaren was dubbed 'The Wally with a Brolly'\n\nSo I refused to believe any more hype. I\u2019d been let down too many times already, and become the bore who\u2019d seen it all before.\n\nThere have been bright sparks since 2007. Indeed we thrashed Croatia in qualifying for the next World Cup.\n\nBut for me the pathetic showings in the last two World Cups and European Championship were an inevitability that demonstrated how far we had fallen.\n\nNow though, through brilliant tactics, honesty, passion and \u2014 shock horror \u2014 picking in-form players rather than a bunch of superstars, England have won me back.\n\nWe are wallies no more.\n\nDear England, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been away so long. I\u2019m coming home.", "description": "JAMES CONEY \u2013 FINANCE EDITOR: It was against Croatia in 2007 \u2013 one year after losing 2-0 against them \u2013 in the pouring rain at Wembley, that my faith in England disappeared altogether.", "authors": ["James Coney For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/21/024CF255000004B0-0-image-a-44_1531082665075.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-08"}
