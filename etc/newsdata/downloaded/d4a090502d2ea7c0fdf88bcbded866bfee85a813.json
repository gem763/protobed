On Wednesday the Guardian spoke to two elite GB athletes who shared the coach\u2019s concerns.\n\nUKA has declined to comment, but before Salazar\u2019s ban its performance director, Neil Black, called him a \u201cgenius\u201d and described his relationship with him as one of \u201ctotal trust, total belief, total respect\u201d.\n\nTravis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, has said that athletes under Salazar\u2019s wing were often kept in the dark about the substances they were given and used as \u201claboratory animals\u201d. Tygart told the German TV channel ZDF: \u201cYou must understand that the athletes really had no idea what was going on with them, what was being given to them. What dosage, whether the methods were forbidden or not, they didn\u2019t even know.\n\n\u201cAn athlete was even told she needed medication for a myoma [a tumour of the uterus], even though she didn\u2019t have a myoma at all. They lied to the athletes and did their medical experiments on them in the NOP. They were simply sent to the doctor and told they must listen to and trust him.\u201d\n\nTygart confirmed that 10 athletes from the Oregon Project had helped Usada investigators. \u201cAll of them provided us with their medical evaluations. We found out they were fake and false information was added after we officially requested it.\n\n\u201cI hope Nike now sees this as a wake-up call. They can\u2019t find any excuses any more, they have to admit that experiments were done on athletes in their name and on their premises, and that was just wrong.\u201d\n\nSalazar, who was stripped of his world championships accreditation, continues to deny any wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal. Nike has also backed the coach and said that his four-year ban \u201chad nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d.", "description": "The governing body is facing calls for an inquiry into how much influence the banned coach Alberto Salazar has had on athletes in its endurance programme", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3fafd3d937b0739ffdb13df6cd7f57ce25b55b/0_64_2134_1280/master/2134.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e0eb53206eb1cde4fb45e4a1b5c4f1e"}
