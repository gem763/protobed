And unfortunately, animals in affected areas have suffered, too.\n\nAccording to reports from over the weekend, more than 100 animals died at a shelter in the Bahamas because of heavy flooding. (In a post on the shelter\u2019s Facebook, the executive director said kennels were submerged in five feet of water. 156 dogs and cats survived.)\n\nIf you want to help these animals affected by Dorian \u2014 and shelters in the northeast that took in hundreds of animals from impacted areas \u2014 below you\u2019ll find various ways to contribute:\n\nThe Humane Society of the Grand Bahamas, the shelter in question, has a GoFundMe page set up for donations. Contributions will go toward supplies and airlifting animals outside of the Bahamas. They\u2019ll also accept donations through the Kohn Foundation, a non-profit that works with the HSGB. You can check the GoFundMe page or the shelter\u2019s Facebook for updates.\n\nThe Best Friends Animal Society is accepting donations as part of it Disaster Relief Fund; the funds will go toward emergency assistance of pets during natural disasters (not limited to Dorian). BFAS is providing updates on its Facebook page regarding shelters with animals rescued from Dorian.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States accepts donations for disaster relief as part of its general Emergency Animal Rescue Fund. According to their website, donations will go toward emergency preparation and response-related activities, including providing resources for animals in need and hiring emergency response staff.\n\nBe wary of any donation page or GoFundMe that claims to represent an organisation that helps victims of Dorian; according to the Humane Society of the Grand Bahamas, there is only one GoFundMe page representing them (so don\u2019t fall for others unless you\u2019ve contacted that shelter directly and properly vetted the campaigner\u2019s relationship with that organisation through their social media presence).", "description": "As Hurricane Dorian continues its path along Canada\u2019s east coast, we\u2019re only  beginning to understand the damage it has caused thus far, particularly in hard-hit areas like the Bahamas....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/tpzubdp7tafeteot53ni.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
