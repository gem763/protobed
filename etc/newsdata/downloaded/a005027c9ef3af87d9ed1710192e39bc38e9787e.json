Trump\u2019s decisions have created conditions for Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime to re-assert control over nearly one-third of the country that had been outside its grip since 2012.\n\nFar from reining in U.S. adversaries, Trump\u2019s presidency will likely be remembered as one through which Assad, this century\u2019s greatest mass murderer, managed finally to claw his way back to a position of undisputed authority.\n\nTrump Just Enlisted America in a New Axis of Evil\n\nThis is the way that\u2019s playing out on the ground in what is, admittedly, still a complicated situation.\n\nThe news began Tuesday morning with Russian pro-Kremlin journalist Oleg Blokhin streaming a live video from inside the recently abandoned American al-Sa\u2019idi\u2019a base in Syria on the western outskirts of the Manbij countryside.\n\n\u201cGood morning to everyone from Manbij,\u201d exclaimed Blokhin. \u201cI\u2019m at the American military base right now, where they were until yesterday morning. Already, we\u2019re here [instead]. We\u2019re going to examine now how they were living here, what they were so busy with, and what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nA second video would show Blokhin as he mockingly played with a boom barrier at the entrance to the base, appearing to check whether or not it worked. \u201cIt\u2019s in good condition,\u201d he assured the cameraman, with a slight grin.\n\nBlokhin, who works for the pro-Kremlin ANNA news network, previously covered the activities of Russian private military contractor Wagner as it trained pro-Assad militiamen in January, and later accompanied Russian and pro-Assad forces during the latter\u2019s successful August campaign to take back the town of Khan Sheikhoun. Now, he stood gloating on a former U.S. military base.\n\nOther pro-Assad media soon conducted similar tours of other U.S. bases abandoned by American soldiers. Reports throughout the day Tuesday would also claim U.S. troops pulled out of two new additional locations including the eastern town of Tal Baydar and the Kharab Ashak base west of Ain Aissa. Shortly before U.S. troops withdrew, ISIS families still being detained at a nearby prison facility in Ain Aissa reportedly set fires throughout the camp in a renewed attempt to try to escape.\n\nIn addition to exemplifying the momentous shift underway as Assad\u2019s vital ally Russia finally replaces the United States as the primary party in northern Syria capable of liaising with most all of the parties to the conflict, Blokhin\u2019s livestream carried a special significance for locals in Manbij.\n\nOver the past week, including several days after Trump\u2019s shock announcement that U.S. troops would withdraw from Syria, American soldiers at the al-Sa\u2019idi\u2019a base actually continued carrying out near-daily patrols in the western and northern Manbij countryside that helped successfully ward off previous attempts by Syrian regime forces to set up positions in the area.\n\nThat offered hope to those in Manbij who oppose the regime\u2014that U.S. military institutions might be capable of coercing the Turkish president to adopt a compromise that saw U.S. troops remain in the area until Turkish-backed forces were capable of assuming control. But those hopes along with more than 16 months of U.S.-Turkish diplomacy were dashed Tuesday as the American troops made their final withdrawal from the area, paving the way for Russian and Syrian regime forces to roll in free and unopposed.\n\nElsewhere, in Ain Aissa and Tal Tamr, towns located along the M4 highway, northern Syria\u2019s main artery and transportation route, Russian and regime forces established permanent checkpoints and bases to ensure control of the strategic route in the face of oncoming Turkish assaults. Those reinforcements appeared to have helped the SDF capture three villages from Turkish-backed forces in the immediate vicinity north of Tal Tamr later that night.\n\nWhile the arrival of regime forces undoubtedly has provided much needed relief for the SDF on several fronts, doing so will come with a cost. As the SDF welcomes more Syrian regime reinforcements into its territory, the group undoubtedly will lose future leverage it would need in order to preserve a role for itself within civil governing institutions throughout northeast Syria.", "description": "GAZIANTEP, Turkey\u2014After eight years of Syrian civil war, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, and the displacement of half the Syrian population, U.S. President Donald J.
