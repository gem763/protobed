It opened into a shopping mall, and a poorly designed one at that. After the last movie I had seen at this theater, it took my friends and me about 20 minutes to find the exit. So after clearing the line of officers, I didn\u2019t know where to run. Frankly, I don\u2019t remember deciding to run in any particular direction. I kept my eyes focused on the back of my friend\u2019s head and booked it, trusting the rest of our group was doing the same and was close behind me.\n\nThe next few minutes \u2014 I think; I have no idea how long this chaos lasted \u2014 are a complete blur.

We ran into an employee who, after the color left his cheeks for a moment at the report of the incident, directed us quickly toward a storage closet where he said we could hide.\n\nA sense of calm washed over me for the first time at the thought of a door we could lock ourselves behind.
