The Senate has yet to set a date for a vote.\n\nREAD: China called the app Hong Kongers use to avoid tear gas 'poisonous.' So Apple removed it.\n\nMore than four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests have plunged Hong Kong\u2019s government into its worst political crisis since Britain handed the city-state back in 1997.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam attempted to give her annual state of the union address but was twice stopped by heckling pro-democracy protesters, before finally resorting to delivering the speech by video.\n\nOpposition lawmakers have repeated their calls for Lam to stand down.\n\n\u201cBoth her hands are soaked with blood,\u201d said Legislative Councillor Tanya Chan. \"We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability. She is not suitable to be chief executive.\u201d\n\nCover: Protestors light their torches during a peaceful rally in central Hong Kong's business district, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019. The protests that started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing's interference in Hong Kong's autonomy that was granted when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
