Ahead of the finale, creator Steven Knight talks about the show\u2019s \u2018bizarre, dream-like\u2019 boom\n\nFrom the streets of Small Heath, Birmingham, to the news stands of Bogot\u00e1, we are now living in a Peaky Blinders world.\n\nThe BBC first broadcast Steven Knight\u2019s series about a gang of razor blade-wielding dandies in 2013. Six years later, its star Cillian Murphy, in character as Tommy Shelby, adorns the cover of Rolling Stone Colombia.\n\nThe final episode of the fifth season will be shown on BBC One on Sunday evening, as the Shelbys tussle with fascist MP Oswald Mosley and a rival gang from Glasgow called the Billy Boys.\n\nAs the Blinders scale new levels of popularity, thanks in no small part to Netflix streaming the show in 183 countries, it is no surprise to hear that A-list stars are contacting Knight asking to join the cast.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of people who get in touch and want to take part,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s Brad Pitt. Snoop Dogg. A$AP Rocky, too. I think in series six we will open the door a little to get some celebrity actors in. The main thing is they have to be good. We\u2019ll just get the best actor for the part, as we did with Sam Claflin, who plays Mosley. He\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Up for a cameo \u2026 Brad Pitt.

It\u2019s very distracting.\u201d\n\n\n\nCould he be referring to Ed Sheeran\u2019s much-maligned appearance in Game of Thrones? \u201cWell, there are some casualties along the road,\u201d he says.\n\nKnight confirms Mosley will return in the sixth season and goes on to say that he has as good as cast an actor in the role of Diana Mitford, second wife to the leader of the British Union of Fascists, the party Mosley founded in 1932.\n\nWhile the Peaky Blinders are roughly based on a real-life gang and their enemies \u2013 former adversaries Billy Kimber and Darby Sabini did exist \u2013 the plot has played fast and loose with facts. With Mosley, the most well-known character depicted, Knight says his storyline will be more historically accurate.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is take history, and the specific things history notices, then write around the things that aren\u2019t so known,\u201d he says. \u201cSo Mosley was having an affair with his wife\u2019s sister and stepmother, but history doesn\u2019t count that, that isn\u2019t what we know him for. But who the hell does that? He was charismatic and magnetic, which made his message seductive and enabled him to draw people in. I want to make people see that evil is seductive and that we need to be careful.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s the luckiest project I\u2019ve ever been involved with\u2019 ... Peaky Blinders. Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC/Caryn Mandabach\n\n\u201cThe rise of fascism, racism, national socialism and populism ... it\u2019s happening now,\u201d continues Knight. \u201cI looked at Mosley\u2019s speeches, and one of them began \u2018Do not believe false news.\u2019 He was telling people that the media was lying to them, that foreigners were taking things away from them. It\u2019s my good fortune \u2013 but the world\u2019s bad fortune \u2013 that these things are happening again and I can write about them. I just hope people realise that nine years after Mosley started making these speeches there was a world war. Let\u2019s not do it again.\u201d\n\nKnight is speaking at the the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival and standing about 50 feet from the first reported crime by a Peaky Blinder \u2013 an assault in March 1890, years before the events depicted in the show.

Earlier in the day, Knight met one fan who had travelled from Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole world we\u2019ve created, it\u2019s more than just clothes and a good soundtrack,\u201d he says. \u201cI do lots of projects in film and TV. You have some that are lucky, and some that are unlucky. Peaky is the luckiest project I\u2019ve ever been involved with. Every time we leap forward a couple of years, we hit a period of history that has such resonance. None more so than the current series. I don\u2019t plan these things that far ahead, it just happens.\u201d", "description": "The world\u2019s biggest stars are queuing up to be cast in the dandy gangster series.
