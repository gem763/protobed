This Is Their Non Negotiable.", "language": "en", "text": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Sunday had a call with President Donald Trump about gun control legislation. According to a statement from Democratic leadership, universal background checks are a non negotiable that must be included in any proposal Trump moves forward with. Specifically, Democrats want Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to bring the legislation to a floor for a vote.\n\n\u201c200 days ago, the Democratic House took decisive action to end the gun violence epidemic in America by passing H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112: bipartisan, commonsense legislation to expand background checks, which is supported by more than 90 percent of the American people. With the backing of the American people, we continue to call on Senator McConnell to \u2018Give Us A Vote!\u2019\n\n\u201cYet, for 200 days, Senator McConnell has refused to give these bipartisan bills a vote on the Senate Floor, again and again putting his own political survival before the survival of our children. Every day that Senator McConnell blocks our House-passed, life-saving bills, an average of 100 people \u2013 including 47 children and teenagers \u2013 die from senseless gun violence. Some 20,000 have died since the House took action on February 27th.\n\n\u201cThis morning, we made it clear to the President that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done, as dangerous loopholes will still exist and people who shouldn\u2019t have guns will still have access. For instance, someone prohibited from possessing a gun under an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) law could still obtain a firearm by exploiting the gun show and online loopholes that H.R. 8 would close. We know that to save as many lives as possible, the Senate must pass this bill and the President must sign it. We even promised the President that if he endorses this legislation and gets Senator McConnell to act on what the House has passed, we would both join him for a historic signing ceremony at the Rose Garden.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats will continue to join with law enforcement, survivors, students and parents, health care providers, mayors and public health officials across the nation to accelerate a relentless drumbeat of action to force Senator McConnell to pass our background checks bills. We will not stop until these bills are passed and our children\u2019s lives are safe. We call upon Senator McConnell to \u2018Give Us a Vote!\u2019", "description": "Hmm..09/15/2019 19:10:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/17/a8f425b6-099a-460f-b254-d899bd8089dc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
