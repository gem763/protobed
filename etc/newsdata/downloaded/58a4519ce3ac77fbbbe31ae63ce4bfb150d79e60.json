Was I alone in finding the \u2018Sandeman man\u2019 \u2013 a sinister faceless figure in cape and wide hat \u2013 the stuff of nightmares?\n\nI grew up in a village in Wales with a dozen pubs, most of which had big signs displaying the Sandeman man to promote Sandeman port: have a taste of Ch\u00e2teau Childcatcher!\n\nIt was only later I discovered that Sandeman was port wine.\n\nAptouring.co.uk offers eight-day Luxury Douro Delights River Cruises on AmaVida, which Frank sailed on, from Porto from \u00a35,895pp\n\nJ. K. Rowling spent a key part of her early life in Porto teaching English as a foreign language. Pictured is an aerial shot of AmaVida passing through Porto\n\nGo with the flow: The river Douro has locks of modest proportions, limiting the size of vessels that can navigate along it. The bridge in this image is the Dom Luis\n\nAnd only very recently that, despite the foreign-sounding name and exotic garb of the Sandeman man, the company was set up in Porto at the end of the 18th Century by two brothers from Perth in Scotland.\n\nThe image of the Sandeman man was created by a Scottish artist who \u2013 inspired by Zorro \u2013 combined a Spanish hat with a Portuguese cape.\n\nThe man is dressed in a traditional Portuguese student cape, a reference to the fact port was a favourite tipple of students in the city of Porto; they still wear the cape (but probably these days are less enthusiastic topers of port).\n\nDo you know who else wears a student cape? Harry Potter. And who spent a key part of her early life in Porto teaching English as a foreign language? J. K. Rowling.\n\nIt is well known that she wrote her first Potter novel as an impoverished single mother sitting in an Edinburgh cafe, but she conceived the book during her Portuguese pregnancy.\n\nOur APT cruise begins in Porto and starts with a tour that bristles with facts.\n\nThe British passion for fortified wine began when wars with France in the 17th and 18th Centuries led to an interruption in the supply of our wine from Bordeaux; Portuguese wine spoiled on the long journey to the UK unless strong alcohol was added to it.\n\nThe British quickly developed a taste for Porto\u2019s wine. We fell out with France and Portugal got a lucrative new industry. At the start of the cruise you see all the port manufacturers and their warehouses, which sit beside the river.\n\nFrank writes: 'If you wondered what it might be like on Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht, it must be much like life aboard AmaVida'\n\nThe AmaVida has a pool on the top deck and most bedrooms (pictured is one) have a balcony\n\nPassengers on the AmaVida can take in the charming sights of the Douro river valley\n\nThe most evocative excursion was to the Palacio de Mateus (pictured), writes Frank\n\nScary stuff: A barrel of Sandeman port\n\nIt was at Porto that we embarked on our eight-day Douro Delights trip and it turned out to be delightful, delicious and de-lovely.\n\nThe ship accommodates 100 passengers: the river Douro has locks of modest proportions, limiting the size of vessels that can navigate along it. Cunning design touches have created a very commodious boat. On the large top deck is a comfortably proportioned pool while most cabins have balconies. If you wondered what it might be like on Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht, it must be much like life aboard AmaVida.\n\nThis cruise is genuinely all-inclusive \u2013 including all food and drink, but also special excursions designed for our amusement. On our second night, the first of two special \u2018Signature Experiences\u2019, was a fabulous evening at the splendid Palacio de Bolsa, where we enjoyed a red-carpet cocktail reception and a rousing performance of traditional fado singing in the Arabian Hall. The second was an unforgettable lunch and a wine-tasting session in a glorious hilltop vineyard.\n\nPerhaps the most evocative excursion was to the Palacio de Mateus. Readers of a certain vintage will recognise its famous Mateus Ros\u00e9 wine. When people became more expert about wine, its previous popularity (it once accounted for 40 per cent of Portugal\u2019s overseas wine sales) became a bit of an embarrassment. Call me unfashionable but I found I still had a fondness for Mateus Ros\u00e9.\n\n'This Portuguese river has a special off-the-beaten-track charm and the pleasures of quiet discovery,' writes Frank\n\nWhile the cruise offers lots of things, for me, the great pleasure was relaxing on deck and enjoying the mellow countryside as we flowed gently past. The charm of a river cruise is relaxing into its slow pace.\n\nThe final treat was a coach trip to the ancient Spanish city of Salamanca, before continuing to Madrid for a stay before flying back to the UK.\n\nThis Portuguese river has a special off-the-beaten-track charm and the pleasures of quiet discovery. \u2018Delightful\u2019 is the perfect description.", "description": "The eight-day luxury 'Douro Delights' cruise  begins in Porto and travels  down the river Douro, stopping for vineyard visits, Fado shows and even red-carpet cocktail receptions.", "authors": ["Frank Barrett For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/16/14/18536346-0-image-a-46_1568640437214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
