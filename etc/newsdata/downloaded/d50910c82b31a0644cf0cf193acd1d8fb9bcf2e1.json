Nardoni determined that Gargiulo's childhood was wrecked with abuse and torture at the hands of his father and siblings, none of which Gargiulo said he recalls.\n\n'HOLLYWOOD RIPPER' CONVICTED OF STABBING TWO WOMEN TO DEATH\n\nPsychologist Vianne Castellano said that from the age of two, Gargiulo, who grew up in Chicago, was brutally abused by his father, who hit him in the head with a baseball bat and golf club, held his hands over a stovetop until they burned and used his neckties to hogtie him, leaving him in a closet for days, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nGargiulo, 43, who remained emotionless for the entirety of the testimony and verdict, was ridiculed by his family as \u201cthe weak link, the sissy-boy, the designated whipping boy of the family.\u201d\n\nAs a child, his siblings tied him to a stump in their backyard and made him watch as they blew up hamsters, gerbils and cats with M-80 firecrackers because they knew he loved animals, Castellano said.\n\nPerhaps the most harrowing testimony came from Gargiulo's son, now 16, who was only 5 years old when his father was arrested in June 2008.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a psychopath,\u201d Andrew Gargiulo told the jury. \u201cI don\u2019t see a murderer. All I see is my dad, and I would like him to still be alive so I can talk to him.\u201d\n\nStill, state prosecutors were relentless in laying out a case of a villainous murderer who abused and killed women for nearly 15 years before he was caught.\n\n\u201cWhen his son was 2, where was he? He was standing over Maria Bruno, removing her breasts,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Garrett Dameron said during closing statements.\n\nGargiulo was convicted of killing 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin in her Hollywood home in 2001. Ellerin was scheduled to meet Kutcher for drinks on the night she died.\n\nASHTON KUTCHER TESTIFIES IN TRIAL OF ALLEGED SERIAL KILLER ACCUSED OF MURDERING HIS FRIEND\n\nEllerin, a fashion design student, was stabbed 47 times, and her body was found by her roommate in the hallway outside her bathroom.\n\nGargiulo was also convicted of the 2005 murder of mother of four Maria Bruno, 32, in her home in El Monte, an L.A. suburb.\n\nBruno, who lived in the same apartment complex as Gargiulo, was stabbed dozens of times, her breasts cut off and her breast implants removed.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe jury also found Gargiulo guilty of the attempted murder of Michelle Murphy in 2008. Murphy was stabbed while in bed at her Santa Monica apartment but was able to fight back, causing the attacker to cut himself. A trail of blood was linked to Gargiulo.\n\nGargiulo was arrested after attacking Murphy and charged with the two California slayings. It was also at that time that police linked him to the murder of 18-year-old Tricia Pacaccio in 1993. He is being tried separately in Illinois in connection with Pacaccio's murder. She was reportedly his friend's older sister.", "description": "A\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0jury recommended the death penalty Friday for the serial killer convicted of fatally stabbing two women -- one of whom was\u00a0actor Ashton Kutcher's friend\u00a0-- and attempting to kill a third in their Southern California homes.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
