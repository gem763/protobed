But he conceded that the talks are dead \u201cfor the time being\u201d and said the United States has recalled Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief U.S. negotiator in the process.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to negotiate peace, you often have to deal with some pretty bad actors,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI know the history, too, at Camp David, and indeed President Trump reflected on that. Some pretty bad actors have traveled through that place throughout recorded history.\u201d\n\nThe canceled summit would have taken place just ahead of the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 Republican in the House, was among those who had sharply criticized Trump over the move to invite the Taliban.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Cheney said Sunday morning on Twitter. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks to the media at the State Department in Washington on Aug. 7, 2019. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nFor months, Khalilzad had been shuttling between the capitals of Afghanistan and Qatar to meet with Taliban leaders and Afghan officials in an effort to forge a peace deal. Last week, he announced that a deal had been reached \u201cin principle\u201d under which the United States would partially withdraw its troops from Afghanistan in exchange for the Taliban renouncing al-Qaeda, which had orchestrated the 2001 attacks.\n\nU.S. officials expected the tentative agreement to advance a comprehensive cease-fire and talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. But after a spate of attacks and bombings by the Taliban, including one that killed a U.S. soldier, further talks over ending the 18-year conflict began to waver.\n\nIn what appeared to be a last-minute scramble to save the negotiations, Khalilzad traveled to Qatar on Thursday for meetings with Taliban officials after U.S. officials had said negotiations with the militant group had ended.\n\nIn his tweets on Saturday, Trump said he \u201ccalled off peace negotiations\u201d after the Taliban took responsibility for an attack in Kabul \u201cthat killed one of our great soldiers, and 11 other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey didn\u2019t, they only made it worse!\u201d\n\nThe president, who was spending his second day in a row at his golf club in Sterling, Va., had not tweeted again on the topic as of late Sunday morning.\n\nPompeo said Sunday on ABC News that U.S. officials had made \u201cenormous progress over the last month\u201d in negotiations with the Taliban.\n\n\u201cWe finally reached a point where we were close. We\u2019d made real progress. And then the Taliban failed to live up to a series of commitments that they had made. And when that happened, President Trump said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to take that deal,\u2019 \u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThe Taliban said in a statement that Trump\u2019s cancellation of the talks would harm the United States and \u201cincrease its financial and human losses.\u201d In his ABC interview, Pompeo responded that the United States will continue its effort to \u201cprotect our nation from a terror attack ever emanating from that place again.\u201d\n\nJohn Hudson and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.", "description": "It is sometimes necessary to negotiate with \u201cbad actors,\u201d the secretary of state said a day after Trump announced the cancellation of the previously undisclosed summit.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PYnO0RyOIXVpnJf_CeAt2xVREWU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LEL4ZUGSJAI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
