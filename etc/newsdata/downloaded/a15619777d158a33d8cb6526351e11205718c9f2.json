Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday praised the Mail for highlighting the issue and promised the Government was working on a plan of action.\n\nA petition calling on the Prime Minister to honour his pledge to fix a broken system that forces countless pensioners to sell their homes to fund crippling care costs was handed to Boris Johnson. Left to right: Sarah Vine, Jill Medlcok, Sharon Muranyi, Eleanor Hayward, Angela Rippon, and Jeremy Hughes\n\nThe petition was started by Sharon Muranyi, a 59-year Mail reader who was forced this year to sell the cottage of her 92-year-old father Fred Hickman to pay for his dementia care.\n\nYesterday, she went to Downing Street to hand in the signatures along with Jill Medlock, who had to sell her family home and spend \u00a3450,000 on dementia care for her parents.\n\nThey were joined at No 10 by Jeremy Hughes of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, TV presenter Angela Rippon, whose mother died of dementia in 2009, and Sarah Vine and Eleanor Hayward of the Mail.\n\nMrs Muranyi said: \u2018The support from all the readers of the Daily Mail has been incredible.\n\nBoris Johnson vowed to \u2018fix the crisis in social care once and for all\u2019 in his first speech as Prime Minister, but no detailed plans have been released\n\n\u2018The Government must listen to us all and take action. My father and thousands others like him deserve better.\u2019\n\nMr Hancock said he \u2018understands the sense of injustice\u2019, adding: \u2018My message to Mail readers is that we are doing the work right now to try to tackle these injustices.\n\n\u2018We need to be a country where people have dignity and support in their old age without the threat of having to sell their own home.\n\n\u2018I understand why people have that emotional connection to their home. I entirely understand why people feel so strongly about it and I want to help find the solution.\u2019\n\nMr Hancock echoed the Mail\u2019s call for a cross-party solution, but said he did not know whether a social care plan would be in the Conservative\u2019s election manifesto.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s big benefits to doing this on a cross-party lines,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019re looking for a solution to bring people together.\u2019 Boris Johnson vowed to \u2018fix the crisis in social care once and for all\u2019 in his first speech as Prime Minister, but no detailed plans have been released.\n\nLast night, charities said the huge response to the Mail\u2019s petition demonstrated why the Government could not put off social care reform any longer.\n\nMr Hughes said: \u2018Too many people affected by dementia are left facing impossible costs for care and a daily battle to get the care and support their loved ones so desperately need.\n\n\u2018More people\u2019s life savings are running out, more people with dementia are stuck needlessly in hospital, which unnecessarily uses valuable NHS resources and hurts families \u2013 and the situation is only getting more desperate. This cannot go on \u2013 it must not go on.\n\n\u2018The Prime Minister promised he would sort out the social care crisis once and for all. But so far we haven\u2019t seen a single step further in terms of detailed plans. People affected by dementia deserve so much better. Our plea to the Prime Minister and his Government is \u2013 don\u2019t let people with dementia down. This shocking state of affairs simply can\u2019t continue.\u2019\n\nMiss Rippon, 74, who is an ambassador for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: \u2018Witnessing my mother\u2019s battle with dementia taught me how cruel a disease this is. People with dementia and their families deserve much better support.\n\n\u2018Why should they face additional battles because they developed dementia rather than any other health condition?\n\n\u2018I hope the outrage demonstrated by over 300,000 Daily Mail readers will force the Government to respond with a plan of action to fix dementia care. We need a firm commitment to sort out social care for once and for all so everyone going through dementia can get good care without having to sell their home to pay for it.\u2019\n\nThe Mail wants end a scandal that means anyone with more than \u00a323,250 in assets \u2013 including the value of their home \u2013 has to pay the full cost of their care, which can reach \u00a3100,000 a year.\n\nWe are also demanding an end to the disgraceful divide that means care home residents who pay their own bills face charges that are \u00a321,000 higher than those funded by the state.\n\nLabour MP Debbie Abrahams, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on dementia, said: \u2018The injustice of people battling to get care, on top of battling the devastating effects of dementia can\u2019t go on and the Prime Minister must listen and act quickly to end the care crisis.\u2019", "description": "A petition calling on the Prime Minister to honour his pledge to fix a broken system that forces countless pensioners to sell their homes to fund crippling care costs was handed to Boris Johnson.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward Health Reporter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19462130-0-image-a-2_1570568093551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
