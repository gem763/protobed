Hampus Lindholm had three assists for Anaheim.\n\nAnaheim handed Colorado its last regular-season home loss, a 5-3 win on March 15. The Avalanche won their last six home games of last season and the first four in Denver to begin this year. Including the 2019 playoffs Colorado had won 14 of the last 15 at home, with the only loss before Saturday coming against San Jose in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nNathan MacKinnon and Joonas Donskoi each had a goal and Pavel Francouz stopped 22 shots for the Avalanche, who came off a 4-1-1 road trip that wrapped up with a 6-1 win at Vegas on Friday night.\n\nHenrique scored 50 seconds into the game and Rowney added another goal 12:01 later to give Anaheim a 2-0 lead. Donskoi got Colorado on early in the second but Getzlaf made it 3-1 at 8:28.\n\nMacKinnon scored on the power play just 1:38 into the third to extend his points streak to 11 games to start the season. Comtois responded at 6:42 when he knocked in a rebound.\n\nThe Avalanche pulled Francouz for an extra skater with 3:05 left and less than a minute later Silfverberg scored into the empty net to ice it. It was his sixth of the year.\n\nNOTES: D Erik Gudbranson was in the lineup a day after Anaheim acquired him from Pittsburgh for forward Andreas Martinsen and a seventh-round pick in the 2021 draft. ... MacKinnon is the first player in franchise history to have at least one point in 11 straight games to start the season. Wendel Clark had at least a point in the first 10 games for Quebec in 1994-95. ... Ducks D Josh Manson (lower body) and F Ondrej Kase (upper body) were out of the lineup.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: At Vegas on Sunday.\n\nAvalanche: Host Florida on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
