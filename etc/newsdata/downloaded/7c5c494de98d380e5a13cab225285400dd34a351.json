The fault runs 185 miles east to west from the San Andreas Fault to Death Valley. Scientists found that it has slipped 0.8 inch (or about 2 centimeters) near its surface since July.\n\nResearchers were able to record the movement for the first time through satellite imagery and seismometer data. The discovery marks the first observation, through modern recording tools, of the fault\u2019s \u201ccreep,\u201d which is the slow movement of a fault.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising because we haven\u2019t seen [the Garlock fault] do that before,\u201d Zachary Ross, an assistant professor of geophysics at Caltech and one of the study\u2019s co-authors, tells TIME. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen it really do anything.\u201d\n\nRoss describes the movement as the slow detaching of land on the fault\u2019s two sides, which typically stay locked through friction. The Ridgecrest earthquakes, the strongest of which was a 7.1 magnitude, caused the two sides to slide away from each other, Ross says. Ruptures in the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence ended just a few miles from the Garlock fault. \u201cThe fact that the Ridgecrest rupture terminated right next to the Garlock is what caused this behavior,\u201d Ross explains.\n\nCourtesy of the California Institute of Technology More\n\nStill, the researchers\u2019 findings prompt more questions than clear conclusions or implications about future earthquakes. As Ross cautions, \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what this observation means.\u201d\n\nLucy Jones, a longtime seismologist who is not affiliated with the study, tells TIME it\u2019s not unusual for faults to move after earthquakes, especially in their shallow parts. This movement does not indicate that an earthquake is about to happen on the Garlock fault, however. Earthquakes usually occur in the deeper parts of faults; while the recorded movement likely happened a few hundred feet below the surface of the fault, a major earthquake is likely to occur about 10 to 15 kilometers deep, according to Jones.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have a trigger slip accompanying a 7 [magnitude earthquake] is really common,\u201d Jones says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a passive response from the fault to the energy being released by the big earthquake.\u201d\n\nPrior earthquakes have been recorded to cause movement in faults, Jones adds. The Los Angeles Times reports the southern part of the San Andreas fault moved, for example, after a magnitude 8.2 earthquake occurred off the coast of southern Mexico in 2017. While such creeps following major earthquakes have been previously observed on the famed fault, they have not triggered further earthquakes, likely because they also occurred in shallow parts, according to Jones.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear whether the destabilization brought by the Ridgecrest earthquakes to the surrounding area will cause further big earthquakes, the Times notes that an earthquake along the Garlock fault could shake the region\u2019s nearby oil and agriculture hubs, along with military bases. A magnitude 8 earthquake has the potential for grave disaster.\n\n\u201cThe whole state of California would feel this one,\u201d Ross says, noting the effects would be worse than the Ridgecrest quakes. \u201cThe direction of the shake will be more intense and felt over a larger area.\u201d", "description": "Scientists say a part of the Garlock fault slipped after being triggered by the series of earthquakes in July", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tiTpQW_OFQOyD6D63w9mIw--~B/aD0zNDc1O3c9NTI0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/21c32d94d41a2bfa7f54761b60181356", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
