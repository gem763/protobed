But who wants to wait that long? Here's POLITICO's guide.\n\nthe points-based program so beloved by some British politicians is only one aspect of the Australian system \u2014 and it's a drop in the ocean.\n\nEarning points\n\nThe current iteration of Australia\u2019s points-based system was rolled out in the mid-1990s to boost the country's intellectual resources and fill gaps in the labor force.\n\nUnder this system, authorities assign points to would-be migrants for desirable characteristics such as youth, level of education, English and foreign language skills and work experience. A pre-determined number of people whose occupations are on a most-wanted list and who score the highest number of points are then invited to apply for a visa, without needing to have a job offer lined up.\n\nPeople aged between 25 and 33, with \"superior\" English-language skills, at least eight years of skilled work experience (preferably in Australia), with a high level of education or a trade, who have studied in Australia and speak a foreign language, score most highly on the points test.\n\nSome of the skilled occupations currently on Australia's list are surgeons, economists, accountants, actuaries, certain types of engineers and scientists, computer programmers, architects and barristers, and also bricklayers, boat-builders, automotive electricians, panelbeaters, plumbers, diesel motor mechanics, carpenters, tennis coaches, electricians and chefs. These desirable jobs change depending on the labor market \u2014 for example, choreographers, geophysicists, footballers and multimedia specialists were added to the list this year, while dentists, anesthetists and watch and clockmakers and repairers were removed.\n\nBut the points-based program so beloved by some British politicians is only one aspect of the Australian system \u2014 and it's a drop in the ocean.\n\nIn the 2017-18 financial year, the last year for which statistics are available, Australia, which has a population of about 25 million, granted 68,111 points-based visas. Compare that to the more than 3 million temporary visas granted, not counting those for tourists, including 378,292 for students, 210,456 for those on working holidays and 64,470 temporary skilled visas; plus 1.9 million visas for New Zealanders, who are allowed to visit, work and live in Australia \u2014 the country's own version of free movement.\n\nJust as EU citizens are a key source of labor for the U.K.'s agriculture and health industries, those temporary migrants take Australia's hardest-to-fill jobs.\n\n\"Australia has a major source of unskilled migrants ... and that\u2019s New Zealand,\" said Peter McDonald, professor of demography at the University of Melbourne. \"And a lot of the temporary migrants, the working-holiday makers, also fill up a lot of the casual, unfriendly-hour type jobs in Australia.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in some sectors of the economy in the U.K., such as health and agriculture, cutting off the supply of lower-skilled EU migrants could be disastrous. Particularly as the number of EU workers arriving in the U.K. is already at its lowest level in six years, according to the Office for National Statistics \u2014 it has halved since its peak before the Brexit referendum.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing has warned that a sudden end to free movement of EU citizens to the U.K. would cause \u201cuntold disruption\u201d to the country's National Health Service.\n\nAnd then there's farming.\n\nFor Canberra and for the wider Australian population, a high migrant intake is a shortcut to economic growth.\n\n\"If you take agriculture, particularly seasonal agriculture, it is heavily, heavily dependent on migrant workers, to the extent that the vast majority of seasonal workers come from EU countries,\" said Madeleine Sumption, the director of Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. Sumption is a member of the U.K. government's Migration Advisory Committee, which has been commissioned to review the Australian system for the Home Office.\n\n\"Especially when you look at soft fruit that are difficult to harvest with machines, production has increased significantly since EU expansion, and that\u2019s essentially because migrant workers are there to do the picking. It is very difficult to argue that you could simply replace that workforce.\n\n\u201cThe debate in this country is really about does the U.K. need that level of growth, does it need to be producing that much labor-intensive produce. That\u2019s a different question.\"\n\nMigration nation\n\nWhen it comes to Australia and migration, international attention in recent years has often focused on reports of horrific conditions at the country's off-shore refugee processing centers. But as hostile as Australia is to refugees who arrive in the country by boat, it is much more welcoming to migrants who come by air.\n\n\"While Australia\u2019s management of asylum seekers characterizes us internationally, ultimately Australia has been and is still a migration nation \u2014 60 percent of our population growth comes from migration and has done for some time,\" said Carla Wilshire, CEO of the Migration Council Australia, an independent migration think tank. \"I would characterize us as having a very generous migration program, both in terms of numbers and pathways.\"\n\nIn fact, almost 30 percent of Australia's population was born overseas, compared to 14 percent in the U.K.\n\n\"It would be wrong for anyone to say that the points system is about keeping our migration numbers small,\" George Brandis, Australia's conservative former attorney general and current envoy to the U.K., told POLITICO's London Playbook. \"Our migration numbers are deliberately large.\"\n\nSo much so that when Theresa May flirted with an Australian-style model, she ended up dismissing it. \u201cWhat the British people voted for on 23 June [in the 2016 EU referendum] was to bring some control into the movement of people from the European Union to the U.K. A points-based system does not give you that control,\" May said back in 2016.\n\n\"It's generally seen as a liberal model that would increase migration rather than decrease it,\" said Sumption.\n\nFor Canberra and for the wider Australian population, a high migrant intake is a shortcut to economic growth.\n\n\"In Australia, there\u2019s a broad understanding in the community that migration is good for our economy and overwhelmingly most people support running a migration program for our economic interests,\" Wilshire said. \"In the U.K. the benefits of migration are not recognized by the broader population.\"", "description": "The system was never designed to cut migration \u2014 just the opposite.", "authors": ["Zoya Sheftalovich", "Sophie In", "T Veld", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-56148768-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
