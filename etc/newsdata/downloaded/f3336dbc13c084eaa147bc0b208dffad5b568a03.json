On Saturday evening, their Books section ran an adaptation of an upcoming book written by two NYT reporters that dredged up the old Deborah Ramirez allegations of sexual exposure at a campus party. However, both the FBI and the Senate Judiciary Committee investigated Ramirez\u2019 claims and never found anyone to corroborate them \u2014 and it took Ramirez several days working with Democratic Party attorneys decades after the alleged incident to supposedly recall that it was Kavanaugh.\n\nIn an attempt to provide belated corroboration for Ramirez, authors Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly dug up a new allegation that fit her story just a little too perfectly:\n\nWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\n\nThis touched off a feeding frenzy on the Left over the past 36 hours. Democratic presidential candidates demanded Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment, and their allies in the Senate began strategizing to make it happen. It turns out that Pogrebin and Kelly left something out of this \u201cpreviously unreported story\u201d when they included it in their adapted column \u2014 they had already discredited it in the book itself.\n\nLate last night, the NYT\u2019s editors finally set the record straight, after editing the excerpt:\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: Sept. 15, 2019\n\nAn earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\u2019s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway, who has her own fact-based book out on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process, noticed the sudden change in the NYT\u2019s position:\n\nBOMBSHELL: New York Times corrects Kavanaugh smear to note alleged victim does not recall any such incident. pic.twitter.com/yigeOyOCzo \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 16, 2019\n\nThat is not nearly good enough. The book\u2019s authors, both reporters for the paper, crafted this article to deliberately deceive readers. They published the allegation while hiding the denial. That\u2019s not reporting \u2014 it\u2019s advocacy, and particularly inept advocacy at that. This calls into question the veracity of everything else this pair has done and will do with this subject matter, and perhaps beyond that as well.\n\nThe paper\u2019s editors have at least as much to answer for here, too. They had to know that any new allegations would create scrutiny for both Kavanaugh and the paper. Did no one think to actually read the book to make sure the story stood up? Or did the editors just give their two reporters carte blanche because they were smearing all the right people? The best case scenario is that the NYT editors involved in this process were too stupid to realize they were getting hoodwinked by their own staff.\n\nThe New York Times owes Brett Kavanaugh an apology, and a full retraction of this article rather than just an \u201ceditor\u2019s note.\u201d Their reporters found nothing more than yet another example of uncorroborated campus rumor about events from three decades or more ago, fueled by politics and a need to sell books and papers. Everyone associated with this should be ashamed of themselves, assuming that any of them have the capacity for shame.\n\nIt seems they don\u2019t.\n\nYou know how NYT added editor's note saying Brett Kavanaugh alleged victim is said not to recall new alleged incident from 35 years ago? Times again leaves that out of new piece, this one about Dem calls for impeachment. https://t.co/Oo7fFW1AsG pic.twitter.com/HOxSycIMsR \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) September 16, 2019\n\nUpdate: Donald Trump has weighed in this morning, after advising Kavanaugh to sue over the weekend:\n\nJust Out: \u201cKavanaugh accuser doesn\u2019t recall incident.\u201d @foxandfriends DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions \u2013 but played the game badly. They should be sued! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s still bad advice to sue. The last thing that Kavanaugh needs is another long, drawn-out judicial process, especially one governed by Sullivan.\n\nBy the way, here\u2019s a screenshot from the book that the NYT editors apparently never bothered to read:\n\nIt was in the next paragraph in the book!

It\u2019s literally old non-news, and yet the NYT and its reporters busily and deceptively regurgitated it.", "description": "YGBFKM.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/facepalm-newspaper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
