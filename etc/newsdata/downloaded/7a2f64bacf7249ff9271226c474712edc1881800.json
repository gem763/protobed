Here are a few of the leading ones.\n\nThere was no quid pro quo in Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskiy. It takes willful naivet\u00e9 to read the memorandum of the call released by the White House that way \u2013 especially given that the Trump administration had held up some aid to Ukraine at the time of the call. In the conversation, Trump said that the U.S. had been good to Ukraine, noted that the relationship was not reciprocal, and then asked for \u201ca favor\u201d and an \u201cother thing.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfavor\u201d concerned Ukrainian cooperation with an effort by Attorney General Bill Barr to look into a conspiracy theory involving Ukraine and the 2016 elections. The \u201cother thing\u201d was to help Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of whether Vice President Joe Biden had intervened to stop a prosecution affecting his son.\n\nIt\u2019s fine for the president to ask for Ukrainian help in uprooting corruption. It\u2019s the administration\u2019s right to set its foreign-policy priorities, and fighting corruption has been a low one. The president\u2019s interest here was obviously personal. Otherwise there would have been no reason to involve Giuliani, a private lawyer, who had already said that he was \u201cmeddling in an investigation\u201d to help his client.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ramesh Ponnuru", "Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
