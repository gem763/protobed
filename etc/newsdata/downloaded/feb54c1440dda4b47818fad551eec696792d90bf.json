A few people want to improve or report things, but are not able to assert themselves.\"\n\nIn one experiment for a veterinary drug company, the group said some of the lab's cats were injected \"`13 times in a single day.\"\n\n\"Again, the staff lacked skills, which resulted in consequences for the animals.\"\n\n\"Most studies end with the death of animals,\" the statement continued, before referring to a section of the video that shows several dog corpses being strung up on hooks, while another is butchered on a bench.\n\nIt also shows an image of a cat's corpse at the bottom of a bin bag.\n\nSOKO Tierschutz and Cruelty Free International are now calling for the lab to be closed and an \"immediate end to the outdated, dangerous and cruel animal toxicity tests\".\n\n\"Our research reveals appalling animal suffering, inadequate care for animals, bad practices, and breaches of European and German law,\" Cruelty Free International's Michelle Thew said.\n\n\"We call for a comprehensive review of this case and all such animal testing in Europe.\"\n\nThe laboratory said in a statement to Euronews: \"We carry out studies for customers in the course of drug approval. These are pre-clinical tests of a substance for toxicity before it goes into clinical testing, for example: tested on humans.\n\n\"These studies are required by law and are approved and supported by the authorities.\n\n\"Animal husbandry is also required by law and is monitored by the authorities, including unannounced inspections.\n\n\"We are cooperating fully with the authorities in the current investigation.\n\n\"We ask for your understanding that we cannot comment further on ongoing investigations.\"\n\nRolf H\u00f6mke, from the German Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies, said that currently \"new drugs cannot be developed without animal testing\".\n\nHe added: \"To refrain from animal experiments would, therefore, be irresponsible.\"\n\n\"If an alternative method is appropriate and legally accepted, it will be used immediately.\n\n\"However, a number of animal-free or animal-saving test methods are still waiting to be accepted internationally by the authorities as a replacement for the tests prescribed so far.\n\n\"Companies are hoping for rapid progress and support from animal welfare organisations.\"", "description": "Distressing footage: Animal cruelty activist films undercover at German testing laboratory", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/03/62/1000x563_cmsv2_966ef0cf-76d3-5a15-b313-013d73d7636c-4240362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
