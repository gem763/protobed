(AP) - Disgruntled defender Jalen Ramsey is missing his fifth consecutive practice with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nRamsey was listed on the injury report Wednesday with a back injury, the same issue that caused him to miss the first game of his four-year NFL career.\n\nRamsey missed one practice last week because of an illness, another because of his back and then two more to be home for the birth of his second child. Ramsey rejoined the Jaguars in time to fly to Denver, but was unable to play against the Broncos.\n\nRamsey told a weekly podcast featuring NFL players last week that his trade request stands. The two-time Pro Bowl cornerback had a heated exchange with coach Doug Marrone on the sideline Sept. 15 and then took exception to personnel chief Tom Coughlin\u2019s criticism after the game.\n\nThe Jaguars have been reluctant to trade one of their best players, preferring to try to work out their differences.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Disgruntled defender Jalen Ramsey is missing his fifth consecutive practice with the Jacksonville Jaguars.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/jaguars_broncos_football_24966_c0-154-3688-2304_s1770x1032.jpg?cabe4463999d660631edbf24d4f2d3dd7e427b39"}
