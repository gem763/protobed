Rescuers want to know who.", "language": "en", "text": "When a recreational boater found Splinter off the coast of Key Largo on Saturday, the green sea turtle was in a bad way. Someone had thrust a spear into its neck. On top of that, the 150-pound animal was tangled in a trap line attached to a buoy. An X-ray would later show the 3-foot metal rod had impaled the turtle so deeply, the spear spanned half its body.\n\nSplinter is okay now, after being rescued by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and rehabilitated by the Turtle Hospital in Marathon, Fla. But now that the weapon has been removed, Splinter\u2019s rescuers want to know who put it there in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely this was an accident,\u201d Turtle Hospital manager Bette Zirkelbach said in a statement, noting Splinter\u2019s injury indicated someone had tried to spear the animal\u2019s underside.\n\nAccording to the Turtle Hospital, Splinter is the second sea turtle found impaled this summer, and the first victim was not so lucky. In June, a dead turtle was found north of Key Largo in Biscayne National Park, with a spear in its head.\n\nIn addition to the spearing, others have perpetrated disturbing acts against sea turtles in Florida this summer. Last week, a woman came across several baby sea turtles who had been burned on a beach. In June a woman was arrested in Miami Beach, after authorities caught her jabbing a nest with a wooden stake and stomping on the eggs with her bare feet, but Miami Beach police told CNN the eggs were not harmed.\n\n\n\nAn X-ray of the spear that impaled Splinter shows the metal rod embedded deep in the sea turtle's body. (The Turtle Hospital)\n\nAll sea turtle species are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act and Florida\u2019s Marine Turtle Protection Act, and harming them could result in fines or jail time. The Turtle Hospital\u2019s chairman of the board, Richie Moretti, offered a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest of the person responsible for spearing Splinter.\n\nSplinter is still a subadult \u2014 a teen turtle, so to speak. A veterinarian first used an endoscope to assess the turtle\u2019s injuries before performing surgery to remove the metal rod. Splinter is in stable condition and resting at the clinic.\n\n\u201cNow it is just a matter of healing before she can be released,\u201d Zirkelbach said.\n\nRead more:\n\nBahamas shelter staff listened as dogs howled amid Dorian floods \u2014 then went silent\n\nAre you smarter than a jellyfish? Then you should care about our oceans, an aquarium says.\n\nSomeone has killed 42 wild burros in the Mojave Desert, and there\u2019s a $50,000 reward.\n\nEndangered panthers are stumbling as though they\u2019ve been poisoned and scientists don\u2019t know why", "description": "An X-ray would later show the three-foot metal rod had impaled the the turtle so deeply, the spear spanned half its body.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "September At Pm", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
