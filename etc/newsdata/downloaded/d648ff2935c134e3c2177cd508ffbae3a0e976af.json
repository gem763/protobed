We have to shut up and work on the pitch,\" Fred told Esporte Interativo.\n\n\"Some critics are pointless - but many can offer me lessons. I like to read what people are saying about my performances. With that, I can try to get better.\"\n\nOn what it means to play for Man United, he added: \"I do understand it.\n\n\"Every day when I arrive at the training ground, when I see those big letters with the name of the club, I pinch myself.\n\n\"So I know this club is gigantic. I like to read about its history, best players and historical moments.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"It hasn't been great times for us \u2014 our rivals are winning titles and we're not even in the Champions League. It makes our fans sad and I feel sad as well.\n\n\"This club deserves silverware and we're going to fight to get better. We have to put United back in the place it should never have left.\"", "description": "The Brazilian midfielder was poor in Manchester United's recent defeat by Newcastle in the Premier League", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531556.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
