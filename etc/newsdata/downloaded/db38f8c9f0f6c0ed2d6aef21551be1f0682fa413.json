I\u2019ve been riding well and the opportunities I have been given, I\u2019ve been giving them every chance [to win]. I\u2019ve just kept rolling with the punches,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working hard and chasing to get rides but it\u2019s not just me, there\u2019s a lot of jockeys struggling to get quality rides.\n\n\u201cI just need to keep chasing like I was before and trying to identify some horses that you can try and get on, but half the jockey room is chasing the same horse so I just need the little things to go my way. Something went my way today and hopefully I can build on it.\u201d\n\nBayliss went into the second section of the Class Three Guangzhou Handicap (1,200m) confident after drawing barrier three with Mr Wealth and things played out accordingly.\n\nAfter tracking the leaders around the home turn, the five-year-old wore down $2.70 favourite Aquila in the final stages to win by a neck.", "description": "Winning is all that matters in Hong Kong and jockey Grant van Niekerk is reaping the rewards of a purple patch of form, with the South African\u2019s phone ringing hot in recent weeks....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/27/a3e1d7d8-f8a9-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_191923.JPG?itok=_CeIMxbd&v=1572175171", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
