We have to start a little faster. You'd expect to at home without the crowd noise being an issue. So we look to start fast in the run game this week.\"\n\nPackers wide receiver Davante Adams thinks the team will click offensively sooner rather than later.\n\n\"We've got plenty of time,\" Adams said. \"I try not to think about that \u2013 we've got time \u2013 because that tends to make people drag their feet. I'm an urgent guy. I like to get better quick. I like to see results fast.\"\n\nThe Packers will begin their homestand against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.", "description": "Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers does not want fans to do the wave when the Packers are on offense.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VY62OzzKtE047.lIDWhZNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jF3tup3K_BZTOYG7MsGc6Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/a687b04765ad2552a398927a56b57a83", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
