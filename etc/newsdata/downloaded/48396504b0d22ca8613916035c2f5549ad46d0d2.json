The artists healing our sleep-deprived world", "language": "en", "text": "Thirty-thousand feet over the Pacific, the author and artist Douglas Coupland asked a flight attendant why the airline\u2019s wi-fi was so impressively fast. She replied that it needed to be: being online made time pass more quickly for passengers, and is preferable to sleeping.\n\nWhy? Coupland suggests we\u2019ve undergone a neural reconfiguration in the 21st century. In 1019, he claims, humans received three-and-a-half dopamine hits a day. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter nicknamed the Kim Kardashian of molecules by British clinical psychologist Vaughan Bell. It creates feelings of pleasure that motivate a person to repeat a specific behaviour.\n\n\u201cA thousand years later, we receive hundreds, thousands, of dopamine hits a day,\u201d argues Coupland. \u201cThe part of our brain that regulates our time perception has been overloaded and exhausted, causing our sense of past, present and future to melt together.\u201d\n\nAn urgent new exhibition called 24/7: A Wake Up Call for Our Non-Stop World explores this culture in which we sleep less, consume content via screens at all hours, disconnect from our surroundings and have our every interaction data-mined and predicted.\n\nFifty artists have been asked respond to the causes and consequences of this culture and how we could combat it. For Jet Slag: Around the World in Seven Sleeps, Alice Vandeleur-Boorer took part in a sleep-deprivation study, living in a lab for 10 days without natural light or knowledge of the time, and advancing her body clock by four hours a night in order to sleep outside the normal 24-hour circadian rhythm. Her photographs and data graphs show the disturbingly disorientating effects the experiment had on her.\n\nAs for Coupland, he has produced a series of posters called Slogans for the 21st Century. \u201cExplain clocks to someone from 1304,\u201d goes one. Elsewhere are \u201cInsomnia is bad for business\u201d and \u201cShopping while sleeping is a fascinating idea.\u201d All are aimed at shaking us from our dogmatic slumbers about how the 24/7 world is changing us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A poster from the series Slogans for the 21st Century. Photograph: \u00a9 Douglas Coupland\n\nBut why would anyone prefer surfing to sleeping? One reason is that the former is designed to keep us in the 24/7 loop. \u201cTech companies understand what causes dopamine surges in the brain and they lace their products with \u2018hijacking techniques\u2019 that lure us in and create \u2018compulsion loops\u2019,\u201d wrote New York Times columnist David Brooks in his article How Evil Is Tech?. In 2017, founding president of Facebook, Sean Parker, told a meeting in Miami that Facebook\u2019s architects exploited a \u201cvulnerability in human psychology\u201d whereby whenever someone likes or comments on a post or photograph \u201cwe \u2026 give you a little dopamine hit\u201d. But users don\u2019t know when these hits will come, so we compulsively check. Even when we should be asleep.\n\nSuch neural hijacking techniques are not new. The makers of slot machines looked to the work of the American psychologist BF Skinner, who found that the strongest way to reinforce a learned behaviour in rats is to reward it on a random schedule. In the show, Mat Collishaw riffs on this idea with a new work called The Machine Zone, in which six animatronic birds move inside \u201cSkinner boxes\u201d, exploring the idea of random reward which underpins the algorithms driving social media interactions. \u201cI noticed that everybody, including me, is on their phones all the time, and how disturbing that is. I couldn\u2019t find a way to show it until I was reading about Skinner\u2019s experiments.\u201d\n\nThe machine always wins: what drives our addiction to social media Read more\n\nCollishaw\u2019s animatronic birds are based on pigeon skeletons but they\u2019re covered in silver to suggest armature. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s showing how we are or have become machines.\u201d On the walls around this installation are C-print photos depicting birds\u2019 corpses \u2013 as if Collishaw is following the consequences of our social media addictions to their logical conclusion \u2026 death. The inspiration came from Henry Wallis\u2019s 1856 portrait of Thomas Chatterton , which depicts the 17-year-old poet lying dead on his bed after taking arsenic. \u201cChatterton constructed these fake identities, such as pretending to be a 15th-century monk, and those identities possibly led to his downfall. For me, the notion of fake identities and performing ourselves online was very resonant.\u201d\n\nThe earliest work in the show is Joseph Wright of Derby\u2019s 1797 painting Arkwright\u2019s Cotton Mills By Night, one of the first depictions of the 24/7 living that arose with the Industrial Revolution. Workers were required around the clock. Arkwright\u2019s mill was not so much the cradle of the industrial revolution as the hand that rocked us out of our cradles and into sleeplessness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arkwright\u2019s Cotton Mills by Night by Joseph Wright of Derby. Photograph: (Joseph Wright)\n\nCoupland says he sleeps for nine-and-a-half hours a day, and feels the benefit. \u201cIf I\u2019ve accomplished anything in this world, it\u2019s most likely because of my rigid adherence to getting uncompromised nightly down-time.\u201d But he is increasingly unusual in this. Consider the white-crowned sparrow. So impressed by the fact that the little bird can stay awake for two weeks during migration, the US department of Defence funded a study of the bird\u2019s natural alertness mechanisms. The goal of the research was to produce a soldier who can stay awake for seven days. Art historian Jonathan Crary, whose book 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep inspired the show, wrote: \u201cAs history has shown, war-related innovations are inevitably assimilated into a broader social sphere, and the sleepless soldier would be the forerunner to the sleepless worker or consumer.\u201d\n\nCrary\u2019s sense is that sleep is the final redoubt, the last zone in our lives that hasn\u2019t yet been exploited for profit. \u201cThe huge portion of our lives that we spend asleep, freed from a morass of simulated needs, subsists as one of the great human affronts to the voraciousness of contemporary capitalism.\u201d Nature abhors a vacuum; capitalism abhors economic dead zones, so it has prodded us awake.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story. Having rudely awoken us to profit from sleeplessness, capitalism \u2013 with its shameless sense of irony \u2013 sold us ways of sleeping better. In Why Can\u2019t We Sleep?, psychoanalyst Darian Leader describes an advertisement asking viewers if they find it difficult to concentrate during the day or have trouble remembering things. \u201cRather than seeing this as the consequence of modern life, long commutes and an unbearable exhortation to maintain a positive image during working hours,\u201d wrote Leader, \u201cit is declared the sign of a poor mattress.\u201d Everything in 24/7 culture is a business opportunity; every moment ripe for shopping.\n\nWe need more than lavender slumber sprays. Helpfully in the show, several artists offer life hacks, to escape the tyranny of 24/7 connectedness, incessant monitoring and sleeplessness. Australian artist Tega Brain\u2019s Unfit Bits tricks fitness monitors into believing users have done more exercise than they have. How? By attaching a fitness tracker to an electric drill, turning the latter on and watching your steps accumulate while you lie on the sofa sipping cocktails and eating crisps as nature intended. Or connecting it to the spinning wheel of an upturned bicycle, or to the pendulum of a metronome. The aim, according to the Unfit Bits blurb, is to \u201cproduce data to qualify [users] for incentives from employers or insurers, even if they can\u2019t afford a high exercise lifestyle\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shroud Chrysalis I, 2000, Catherine Richards. Photograph: David Barbour/Catherine Richards\n\nCatherine Richards\u2019 Shroud/Chrysalis 1 invites visitors to wrap themselves inside a copper blanket. They\u2019ll still be able to see and hear through the fabric, but will be protected from any electromagnetic signals, not least all the incoming blah of social media. I suspect there will be a queue, given the chance her piece offers for social media junkies to catch up on sleep. The same goes for Tatsuo Miyajima\u2019s meditative isolation chamber, entitled Life Palace (Tea Room), which visitors can climb inside, from where to follow the blue glow of blinking LED numbers showing the passing of time.\n\nIndeed, the curator of 24/7, Sarah Cook, is heroically bold in offering visitors so many opportunities to sleep during the show. Hyphen Labs\u2019 booth confronts visitors with pictures of people yawning and, if they can\u2019t resist following suit, they will be captured mid-yawn.\n\nMore ingeniously sleep-inducing still is Tracking Transience, Hasan Elahi\u2019s decade-long project to bore viewers with data. It originated when Elahi was wrongly identified as a terrorist and submitted to a six-month FBI investigation. \u201cViewers can see exactly where I am and what I\u2019m doing, not to mention all sorts of details such as my telephone calls, my banking records, my flight data, as well as a few more things of a personal nature that I feel I should disclose to the FBI so they can know me a little better.\u201d Time-stamped photos flash by on screen showing half-made beds, every toilet he\u2019s ever used, every meal he\u2019s ever eaten. It\u2019s like being cornered at a party by someone without an edit function.\n\nThere are 70,000 images to explore. \u201cAfter all, the FBI wanted to know everything about me and I\u2019m all about full disclosure,\u201d Elahi says. In an age where privacy cannot be allowed, Elahi has brilliantly turned the tables on the data miners. At the same time, he has found what we need more than anything in our sleepless age: a surefire cure for insomnia.\n\n\u2022 24/7 is at Somerset House, London, 31 October to 23 February.\n\n\n\n", "description": "From experiments in light deprivation to \u2018unfitness monitors\u2019, works by Douglas Coupland and others in this urgent exhibition resist the 24/7 demands of late capitalism", "authors": ["Stuart Jeffries"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f4eb947255955e202757fcbb366771fd778ea8/0_53_2814_1689/master/2814.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32d608cbaff5bf8cf7b923c5c4de535f", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
