Here\u2019s what you need to know about it, from the process to the politics.\n\nWhy are they having a vote, really?\n\nIt does seem that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) initially had no intention of doing this. There are no rules that say she has to hold a vote, and the inquiry has had success calling witnesses for weeks now, even though there wasn\u2019t a vote formalizing it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut House Democratic leadership felt the pressure of Republican claims that they weren\u2019t being transparent. Not that Republicans\u2019 attacks were all merited: Closed-door depositions are the norm in Congress when dealing with the executive branch. Even former Republican lawmaker Trey Gowdy, who led the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton and the 2012 Benghazi attack, said as much (while also vouching for some of Republicans\u2019 complaints in this instance). You don\u2019t want lawmakers performing for the camera, and you don\u2019t want witnesses knowing what other witnesses know.\n\n.@TGowdySC says he still believes in the role of private testimony \"100%\" amid GOP outrage over Democrats' closed-door hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry pic.twitter.com/BMfWZb3MEM \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 27, 2019\n\nBut Trump and the Republicans are relentless, and on this, effective, messengers. So, there will be a vote.\n\nWhat will the vote do?\n\nIt will authorize a resolution that sets up how public hearings will work. It\u2019s expected to pass, since all but five House Democrats have said they support this impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow will those hearings work?\n\nAccording to the resolution, the House Intelligence Committee will hold public hearings. The timing isn\u2019t specified in the resolution, but The Washington Post has reported those could get started by mid-November.\n\nChairman Adam B Schiff (D-Calif.) will get to call witnesses. The Post has reported that he is already considering the current acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, and the ousted one, Marie Yovanovitch, to testify again, this time in public. It\u2019s a safe guess he would like the impeachment inquiry\u2019s star witness so far, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, to also publicly testify about what he heard firsthand on Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nAD\n\nWhat can Republicans do in these hearings?\n\nDemocrats control the majority in the House and, thus, the Intelligence Committee and, thus, this process. But this resolution will set up some authority for Republicans, such as:\n\nAD\n\nHowever long Schiff gets to question witnesses (up to 45 minutes at a time, way more than the usual five minutes per member in a regular hearing), the top Republican on the committee gets the same amount of time. That\u2019s Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who is a staunch Trump ally.\n\nRepublicans can try to subpoena other witnesses and documents, but Democrats can vote those recommendations down with a committee vote.\n\nThe resolution also tries to lift the veil of what\u2019s been happening behind closed doors for the past six weeks. Schiff can release any transcripts of the depositions he wants to. That means we\u2019ll hear what people testified beyond their leaked opening statements. We\u2019ll also get a better understanding of how serious Republicans on the three committees involved in these depositions are taking the investigation.\n\nFinally, this resolution confirms that the Intelligence Committee will write a report about what it found. That report will go to the Judiciary Committee, which will use it to consider what articles of impeachment to write up against Trump.\n\nAD\n\nHow will the Judiciary Committee write up articles of impeachment?\n\nThe Judiciary Committee can decide to hold hearings, too. These would probably be focused less on what people knew about Trump\u2019s efforts to politicize Ukraine policy and more about why Trump deserves to be impeached. During these hearings, Republicans can also request or even subpoena witnesses, but they\u2019ll be subject to a vote by a committee that Democrats control.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout the process in the Judiciary Committee, Trump\u2019s legal counsel can attend the hearings, ask questions of the witnesses, give written explanations, raise objections to some witnesses and ask Democrats to invite other witnesses. But this is all at the discretion of House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold E. Nadler (D-N.Y.). And as The Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis reports, if Nadler deems Trump noncompliant with the subpoenas, the lawmaker can take away the president\u2019s right to cross-examine witnesses and produce new evidence.\n\nAD\n\nWhen that\u2019s all done, \u201cthe Committee on the Judiciary shall report to the House of Representatives such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper,\u201d its rules read.\n\nThis is pretty standard stuff, as far as impeachment inquiries go. As Democrats noted in talking points, these are all rights that were afforded Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton during their impeachment inquiries.\n\nAD\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is bringing charts as it rolls out its procedures for impeachment proceedings pic.twitter.com/ULaMON7Uj6 \u2014 Jeremy Herb (@jeremyherb) October 29, 2019\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about this resolution?\n\nThey\u2019ve been trying to undermine the impeachment inquiry by arguing it\u2019s not legitimate until they have a vote. Now that there will be a vote, Trump\u2019s defenders are saying it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Democrats are out to get Trump. \u201cThey can\u2019t undo what they\u2019ve done thus far,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said.\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that \u201cit falls way short, way short\u201d on protections for Trump, taking issue with the fact that Democrats have all the discretion on how and whether the president\u2019s attorney can present competing evidence.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that much of Republicans\u2019 criticism about the process being unfair is disingenuous. That\u2019s because, as they surely know, the inquiry itself isn\u2019t a trial. The trial happens in the Republican-controlled Senate, where McConnell is in charge, if and when Trump gets impeached by the House.\n\nAD", "description": "It will give Republicans leverage, but this is still a Democrat-driven process.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vjCALgq-YuW1idFWFcSniNREzg4=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-29-2019/t_88185f42140a4777a8fc206d9a66c5d7_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_04_06_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
