And believe me, it will be enough,\" Draghi told a London conference in July 2012.\n\nThe ECB backed up his promise with a scheme that would allow it to buy unlimited amounts of government debt in exchange for tough reform programmes.\n\nNever put into practice, the tool known as \"outright monetary transactions\" (OMT) helped calm financial markets.\n\nBut it also angered German eurosceptics, who failed in a legal challenge against the instrument.\n\n- Trillions to fight deflation -\n\nBy 2014, the ECB faced a new risk: deflation, a harmful downward spiral of prices and activity.\n\nYears after other central banks, Draghi steered the ECB into \"quantitative easing\", mass purchases of government and corporate debt, in early 2015.\n\nBy the time the programme was set to idle in December last year, the ECB had bought 2.6 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) of bonds, visibly improving employment and growth rates.\n\nBut despite the years of stimulus, inflation remained short of the central bank target of just below two percent.\n\n- Greek crisis -\n\nUnder Draghi, the ECB was closely involved in keeping Greece in the single currency and avoiding a financial collapse.\n\nIts \"emergency liquidity assistance\" (ELA) kept the country's banks flush during the worst moments.\n\nThe central bank also played a key role in negotiations over loans to Greece that helped stabilise the economy, in exchange for painful reforms.\n\n- 'Almost Prussian' to 'Count Draghila' -\n\nHard as it is to believe today, Draghi was a darling of German media when he arrived, seen as \"almost Prussian\".\n\nWhen he took his seat in Frankfurt, tabloid-style daily Bild photoshopped a spiked helmet from the militaristic core state of the pre-WWI German Empire onto his head, seeing him as backing their vision of monetary policy.\n\nSince then, he has become a whipping boy for conservative German opinion, many of whom believe his attempts to restore inflation with easy money favour spendthrift southern European states at the expense of the parsimonious North.\n\nFormer finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble even accused Draghi of stoking the German far right.\n\nGermans particularly resent the low or negative interest rates resorted to by the ECB, saying they are harming banks and savers.\n\nAfter a fresh rate cut in September, Bild depicted Draghi as a vampiric \"Count Draghila\", accusing him of \"sucking our accounts dry\".\n\nRecently, former senior central bankers from Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands signed an open letter criticising ECB policy.\n\n- Slammed doors -\n\nOn the ECB's governing council -- made up of the 19 national central bank governors and six board members -- divisions also reached a peak in September.\n\nDutch central bank chief Klaas Knot called that month's rate cut and relaunch of QE \"disproportionate\", while Bundesbank (German central bank) head Jens Weidmann said Draghi was \"overshooting the mark\".\n\nGerman ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger even resigned.\n\nIt will now be up to Lagarde to overcome the trench warfare and restore a collaborative atmosphere around the council table.", "description": "Mario Draghi hands over the keys of the European Central Bank to Christine Lagarde on October 31, leaving the former IMF chief a eurozone economy struggling to stay in gear.
