In Sunday\u2019s 17-16 win against the Miami Dolphins, the Redskins safety exploded through the gap and easily worked his way past to drag down quarterback Josh Rosen.\n\nThe play was not only Collins\u2019 first sack of the year \u2014 it was part of a shift in the way Washington has used its $84 million man. Against the Dolphins, the Redskins emphasized generating more pressure, partially doing so by sending Collins off the edge.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, the Redskins have done a much better job of getting after the quarterback, recording nine of their 14 sacks over the past two weeks. And sure, five of those came against the winless Dolphins, but the other four were against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.\n\nWashington\u2019s overall defense has improved as a result.\n\n\u201cOur interior has provided more push and more production than our outside guys have, so that\u2019s a challenge that we accept,\u201d interim coach Bill Callahan said. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to get a little more heat on the quarterback. We\u2019re definitely tied into that.\u201d\n\nEntering the year, the Redskins\u2019 defensive line was supposed to be the team\u2019s biggest strength, which is why the unit\u2019s struggles through the first four weeks were confounding.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just one player who struggled, either. Linebackers Ryan Kerrigan and Montez Sweat couldn\u2019t consistently win their matchups. The interior, bolstered by Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne, wasn\u2019t collapsing the pocket. Through the first two games, Washington had just two sacks \u2014 one from Kerrigan and another from Cassanova McKinzy, who isn\u2019t even on the active roster anymore.\n\nBut something clicked soon after. Schematically, the Redskins tried to get more creative in the ways they blitzed. Collins\u2019 usage, for instance, was part of the game plan heading into Miami, Callahan said. Collins finished with 12 tackles against Miami and was named the NFC defensive player of the week on Wednesday.\n\nKerrigan, though, said it also comes down to the defensive line playing better up front.\n\n\u201cJust winning one-on-ones has been the biggest thing,\u201d Kerrigan said. \u201cOur interior has done a really great job of winning their one-on-ones and putting a lot of great pressure. I feel like we\u2019ve done a better job on the edge the last couple weeks than the previous ones.\u201d\n\nAfter Week 6, the Redskins have now pressured quarterbacks on 25.8% of their dropbacks \u2014 the 13th-best rate in the league, according to Pro Football Reference. Last year, Washington\u2019s pressure percentage was at 24.1%, ranking 21st.\n\nThe Redskins, too, don\u2019t blitz nearly as much as other teams. Typically, defensive coordinator Greg Manusky relies on Washington\u2019s front four to collapse the pocket. League-wide, the Redskins have blitzed just 24.2% of the time, the 10th-lowest rate. By comparison, the Ravens have sent an extra attacker 49.3% of all dropbacks.\n\nKerrigan and defensive end Matt Ioannidis lead the defense with 12 pressures each.\n\nWashington has also seen improvement in Sweat, who was acquired in the first round when the Redskins sent two second-round picks to the Indianapolis Colts to move back up in the draft. Like the rest of the defense, Sweat had a quiet start to the year \u2014 getting blanked against the Eagles and Cowboys.\n\nIn both of those matchups, Sweat went against two of the NFL\u2019s premier tackles, Philadelphia\u2019s Jason Peters and Dallas\u2019 Tyron Smith.\n\nSweat said facing two elite players right away helped his transition into the league.\n\n\u201cGuys like that are really going to harp on your fundamentals,\u201d said Sweat, who has one sack and six hurries in 2019. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be real fundamentally sound when going against tackles like that.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Redskins face a San Francisco 49ers team which has held up well in pass protection. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has been sacked only six times and hit just 12 times.\n\nIn particular, the 49ers do an excellent job of disguising their offense. They fool defenses by sending players in motion before the snap, getting them to shift one way and creating misdirection.\n\nSafety Montae Nicholson said the Redskins have to be aware of San Francisco\u2019s tendencies by closely studying the film.\n\nFor now, though, the Redskins are pleased their defense is playing closer to expectations.\n\n\u201cAny time you can create and generate pressure on the quarterback, cause interceptions, cause bad throws, it\u2019s definitely encouraging and inspiring,\u201d Nicholson said, \u201cespecially to your guys up front and it encourages guys on the back end. It kind of goes hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
