As with all things Odyssey, it is intimidatingly large.\n\nI\u2019ve only taken the quickest of tours in Odyssey\u2019s new mode, just enough to see the game\u2019s map freckled with nodes for some 30 tours and hundreds of educational points of interest. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m even ready to plunge into this mode yet. I\u2019ve still got piles of quests to clear in the main game, even after playing it for over 140 hours.\n\nUbisoft introduced the Discovery Tour concept in 2017\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins, opening that game\u2019s ancient Egyptian map for educational exploration mixed with a dash of anachronism.\n\nThe idea was to allow players to play virtual historian, exploring an ancient civilisation without having to deal with the combat or quests of the standard game.\n\nEverything is enhanced in Odyssey\u2019s take, as things tend to be for gaming sequels.\n\nThere are tours again, guided walks from node to node to learn about the Acropolis or Spartan politics or the Battle of Marathon. Origins had a disembodied narrator talk players through each tour. Odyssey uses historical and fictional figures who were featured in the main game to guide you.\n\nA tour might begin with Herodotos or Leonidas greeting you, offering you a chance to chat before you hear them explain each sight along the tour. The educational traipse ends with a low-stress quiz that doesn\u2019t appear to be scored.\n\nPlayers can also freely explore in this mode, activating the many markers on the map for quick image-and-text entries about various cultural and historical elements. It wouldn\u2019t be a true Ubisoft game without a ton of things to clear on a map, right? Frankly, that\u2019s just the kind of thing to hook me in, and I had a good time ignoring the tours so I could poke around and see what individuals nodes indicated about a building or gathering of people.\n\nA small number of these markers reveal behind-the-scenes details about the making of the game, though none that I\u2019ve found yet are all that extraordinary. One node explained the prevalence of music in ancient Greece and the game designers\u2019 subsequent desire to compose a lot of music for the game.\n\nOrigins let players choose from a roster of main game characters, some of them initially locked off, to use while walking through the Discovery Tour mode. Odyssey does the same, but adds a selection of horses to ride. Explore enough and the game will unlock more exotic rides like a unicorn or a horse on fire. If that doesn\u2019t make much sense, it didn\u2019t in the main game either, but where better to learn than on the back of a Pegasus?\n\nOdyssey\u2019s Discovery Tour will be added for free on September 10 and will also be sold as a standalone experience on PC for around $30 for those not interested in the other parts of the game.", "description": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey finally gets its Discovery Mode Tour this month, offering a way to explore the game\u2019s recreation of Ancient Greece peacefully while maybe just learning something.
