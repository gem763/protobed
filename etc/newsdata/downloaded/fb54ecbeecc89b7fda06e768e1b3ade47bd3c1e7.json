As Current Affairs\u2019 Nathan Robinson writes, Mayor Pete\u2019s own book suggests he is one of the latter type. He\u2019s a guy who went from Harvard straight to McKinsey, \u201cthe world\u2019s most sinister and amoral management consulting company.\u201d He expressed no serious qualms about that experience in his book, nor much interest in the plight of the poor black residents of South Bend, Indiana where he was subsequently elected mayor.\n\nThen there is his stint in Afghanistan in 2009, done during a sabbatical from his mayoralty. There is something off about a serving mayor who goes to do a single tour of duty in military intelligence for an obviously doomed, hideously bloody occupation \u2014 unless, that is, the point was to simply add a line to his resume.\n\nAdditionally, while there is such a thing as a person being too aged and infirm to be a good political leader, there is also something to be said for experience. Even a genius like Napoleon took years of practice to reach his full potential as a military leader. Being president of the United States is one of the most difficult, demanding positions in the world. It takes stupendous arrogance to think one can just pick it up on the job after running a city less than half the size of Spokane, Washington for a few years.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ryan Cooper", "Theweek.Com Articles Rise-Entitled-Millennial-Politician"], "top_image": ""}
