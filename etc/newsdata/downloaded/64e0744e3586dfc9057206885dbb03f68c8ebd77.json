Col. Alexander Vindman told impeachment investigators that at least two portions of the July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were omitted from the summary of the conversation released by the White House.\n\n\u201cYeah, he testified that in two occasions the ellipses, the dot-dot-dot, should have been some words,\u201d Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told NPR. \u201cWe annotated those on our copies of the call. I will tell you that some people may see them as significant. I don't see them as significant.\u201d\n\nPerry, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was one of the lawmakers who heard more than 10 hours of explosive testimony Tuesday from Vindman, a National Security Council staffer overseeing Ukraine policy.\n\nVindman, who listened in on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, told investigators that the president undermined U.S. national security when he pressured his foreign counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, according to a copy of Vindman\u2019s opening statement obtained by POLITICO.\n\nThe New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Vindman also testified that the White House\u2019s readout of the call had missing words and phrases, and that he was unsuccessful in attempting to restore all the omissions to the rough transcript.\n\nBut Perry\u2019s remarks Wednesday appear to provide the first on-the-record acknowledgment of those details of Vindman\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cThe words, generally speaking, that were replaced have already been kind of noted elsewhere, either in the call or in conjecture,\u201d Perry said. \u201cSo it might be significant in some people's mind. It might be just inartful, and just a clerical discrepancy.\u201d\n\nPerry, however, declined to comment on what the two leaders allegedly discussed during the parts of the call left out of the official White House summary. He refused to confirm reports that Vindman said Trump referred to recordings of Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine and that Zelensky mentioned Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy firm on whose board Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat.\n\n\u201cI'm not allowed to divulge what was said in the hearings for \u2014 because of a potential ethics violation,\u201d Perry said, adding: \u201cI don't think that that part was part of his opening statement, so I got to be careful what I talk about the particulars there. So I just can't get into that.\u201d\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy asking for a briefing on how Vindman is being protected after conservative media, Trump and Rudy Giuliani attacked him publicly after his testimony. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that \u201cthis vitriol \u2026 may result in professional reprisals and threats to his personal safety and that of his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent on the Army to ensure that he is afforded the same protections as whistleblowers and protected from reprisal for testifying before Congress,\u201d Schumer wrote.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this story.\n\n", "description": "A Republican congressman on Wednesday confirmed Lt.
