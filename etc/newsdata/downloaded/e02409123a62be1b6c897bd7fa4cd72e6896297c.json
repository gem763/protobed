That\u2019s the question we\u2019ll be exploring over the next 10 months in POLITICO\u2019s Telescope: The New AIDS Epidemic. Thirty-five years after the discovery of HIV \u2014 and the explosion of an epidemic that transformed the world \u2014 AIDS rarely makes the headlines. It once revolutionized the way we approach outbreaks of disease, upended the economics of the pharmaceutical industry and changed some of the most intimate aspects of how we live our lives, devastating entire communities as it did so. Today, breakthroughs in treatment have transformed it from a death sentence into a manageable disease and progress in prevention has largely pushed it out of the public consciousness in wealthy countries. The truth, however, is that HIV still lurks beneath the surface, where it continues to transform communities across the world. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making HIV and AIDS the subject of POLITICO\u2019s first-ever Telescope \u2014 our marquee home for in-depth reporting and analysis on the biggest challenges facing politicians, policymakers and business leaders. Over the next 10 months, we\u2019ll be holding the mirror up to the modern face of AIDS, looking at how the challenges have mutated and metastasized since the early years of the epidemic. From San Francisco to Johannesburg, from Paris to Kiev, we\u2019ll be looking at how policymakers, medical workers and regular people responding to HIV and AIDS today. Do you have insights about HIV or AIDS you want to share? Send me a note. Just let me know if you\u2019d prefer to stay anonymous: telescope@politico.eu We\u2019ll be back with some of your answers in our next monthly POLITICO Telescope newsletter.
