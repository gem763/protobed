(\u201cCME\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (CSE: CME) is pleased to announce that it has amended its previously announced option agreement (the \u201cOption Agreement\u201d) with FeTiV Minerals Inc. (\u201cFMI\u201d), a private exploration company which owns an 80% undivided interest in the Mouchalagane, Silicates Lake, Seignelay, Lac Robot and Baie-Trinit\u00e9 iron projects (the \u201cIron Projects\u201d), located in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec, with CME owning the remaining 20% undivided interest (see news release dated July 8, 2019 for more information on the initial announcement and short description of the Iron Projects).\n\n\n\nAmended Terms of the Option Agreement\n\nUnder the initial agreement, CME has the option to indirectly acquire the remaining 80% undivided interest it does not hold in the Iron Projects by acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of FMI. The only amendment to the Option Agreement is an extension of the delays for CME to complete its payment obligations from 18 to 48 months, thereby allowing CME to acquire a determined ownership percentage of FMI with each payment, following which FMI will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). The total consideration to be paid remains unchanged and is set at a maximum of $20 million, payable in cash and in shares of CME as detailed in the table below.\n\nThe Transaction constitutes a \u201cRelated Party Transaction\u201d within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\") in light of the fact that St\u00e9phane Leblanc, VP Development and a director of CME, and G\u00e9rald Panneton, Chairman, CEO and a director of CME, each holds more than 10% of the shares of FMI. In addition, Mr. Leblanc is also the sole officer and director of FMI.\n\nNevertheless, and as required by MI 61-101, the Option Agreement and CME\u2019s obligations thereunder are subject to CME obtaining the prior approval of the majority of the minority shareholders at a special meeting to be called to that effect by CME. The date of such special meeting has not yet been set by the board of directors and is contingent upon the preparation of, notably, a management proxy circular which will contain the disclosure required under applicable securities regulations to allow the shareholders of CME to make an informed decision. The record date and date of the special meeting will be communicated to the Company\u2019s shareholders in due course.\n\nThe Transaction benefits from a statutory exemption from the formal valuation requirement provided under section 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 on the basis that the Company is not listed on any of the specified markets. It should be noted that while CME is no longer relying on the \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d exemption set out in sections 5.5(g) and 5.7(1)(e) of MI 61-101 (see the July 8, 2019 press release), the company continues to experience difficultly in meeting its obligations as they become due and is in need of working capital. In this regard, please see the section below regarding the proposed $2 million private placement.\n\nIn addition, the Company has requested the delivery of technical reports on the Mouchalagane and Silicates Lake projects. Once received, the technical reports will be publicly filed on the Company\u2019s issuer profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\n\nPursuant to the terms of the amended Option Agreement and in order to complete the Transaction, CME must make the following payments to the shareholders of FMI:\n\nTiming Cash Shares* FeTiV Share Ownership Increase Within 120 days from date of shareholder approval $1M Value of $1M (up to 1 million shares) 10 % On or before 18 months after the initial payment $2M Value of $2M (up to 2 million shares) 10 % On or before 36 months after the initial payment $3M Value of $3M (up to 3 million shares) 20 % On or before 48 months after the initial payment $4M Value of $4M (up to 4 million shares) 40 % Total $10M Value of $10M (up to 10 million shares) 80 %\n\n*Shares will be issued at a deemed price equal to the greater of: (i) $1.00 per Share or (ii) the market price of Shares on the date such Shares are to be issued under the Option Agreement, as amended.\n\nSince the initial Option Agreement announced on July 8th, 2019, CME has been the operator of the Iron Projects. As previously announced, each of the Iron Projects is subject to a 2% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, half of which can be bought for $5M.\n\nThe Option Agreement remains subject to approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the \u201cCSE\u201d). The Shares issued as consideration under the Option Agreement will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and one day from the date of the Transaction, as well as additional escrow requirements, if required, under the policies of the CSE.\n\nPrivate Placement of Up to $2 Million\n\nThe Company also announces a non-brokered private placement (the \"Offering\") of up to 4,000,000 common shares at a price of $0.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $2,000,000.\n\nThe Company will use the net proceeds from the Offering for general working capital and corporate purposes. The closing of the Offering is independent of and not contingent upon the Transaction and the full amount of the proceeds will be available to the Company to satisfy its financing needs whether or not the Transaction closes.\n\nThe securities issuable in connection with the Offering will be subject to a statutory four month and one day hold period. Closing of the Offering is anticipated to occur later this month or at the beginning of November and is subject to the approval of the CSE. Finder's fees may be payable in appropriate circumstances in connection with the Offering, in accordance with the policies of the CSE.\n\nAbout Canadian Metals Inc.\n\nCanadian Metals is a diversified resource company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of large-scale mineral deposits in specific commodities and safe jurisdictions.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nG\u00e9rald Panneton\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nEmail: gpanneton@canadianmetalsinc.com\n\n\n\nPatsie Ducharme\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nEmail: : pducharme@canadianmetalsinc.com\n\n\n\nWebsite: www.canadianmetalsinc.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information\n\nCertain statements in this news release constitute \"forward-looking\" statements.
