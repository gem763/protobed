I think the team was very focussed. Maybe we missed the last touch a bit.\u201d\n\nBrazilian Philippe Coutinho had the hosts\u2019 first good chance in the 21st minute, as Bayern dominated possession from the start but had to remain patient against a packed Serbian defence.\n\nThey eventually broke the deadlock through Coman\u2019s diving header.\n\nThe Serbs had no answer to Bayern\u2019s firepower, with the Germans mustering 16 shots on goal in the first half alone.\n\nThey instead defended and waited for the rare opportunity to launch a quick counter attack in the hope of catching Bayern off guard.\n\nIt was the same story after the break with Corentin Tolisso hitting the post in the 53rd.\n\nBayern should have scored shortly after when Perisic chipped the ball over the Red Star keeper, but it bounced on the bar and Lewandowski\u2019s half volley on the rebound flew over the empty goal.\n\nYet the Poland striker got onto the scoresheet in the 80th, sliding in to beat his Red Star markers, before Mueller got his first of the season in stoppage time.\n\nThiago Alcantara had earlier also hit the woodwork with a deflected cross.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that my team had quite a few uncompleted passes and these were punished by our opponents,\u201d said Red Star coach Vladan Milojevic.\n\n\u201cBayern and Tottenham are the favourites in the group, and we saw why tonight. We are aware that we played against a possible winner of the Champions League.\u201d\n\nIn the group\u2019s other game, Olympiakos Piraeus came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in Athens.", "description": "Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski scored a landmark 200th goal for the club as they kicked off their Champions League campaign by easing to a 3-0 victory over Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday in a one-sided Group B encounter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431375734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1YU", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
