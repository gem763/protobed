Biden\u2019s son, according to a report\n\nIn the July phone call, Mr. Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who has served on the board of a Ukraine gas company since 2014 when his father was vice president, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nMr. Trump wanted the Ukraine president to work with his private attorney, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, investigating the corruption case.\n\n\u201cHe told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know\u201d if his lawyer\u2019s assertions that Mr. Biden acted improperly as vice president were true, a source familiar with the call told the newspaper.\n\nThe revelation this week of the whistleblower\u2019s allegation that Mr. Trump acted inappropriately in a conversation with a foreign leader stirred wild speculation in Washington and prompted an emergency meeting by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe newspaper report directed the conversation away from Russia and North Korea but opened a new round of speculation about Mr. Trump\u2019s misuse of his office to advance his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani said they had done nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another political hack job,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who said he didn\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower.\n\nThe potential corruption stems from Mr. Biden\u2019s actions in March 2016, when he was vice president and visiting Kiev. He threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if the nation\u2019s leaders did not fire Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor.\n\nMr. Biden said the prosecutor was \u201cturning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite.\u201d But the prosecutor was also investigating Ukraine gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a high-paying seat on the board.\n\nThe prosecutor was fired soon after Mr. Biden\u2019s visit.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Biden, who is the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters that \u201cnot one single credible outlet has given any credibility\u201d to the assertions of corruption.\n\nLater, Mr. Biden released a statement refocusing the corruption charge on Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIf these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia\u2014pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden said the \u201cclear-cut corruption\u201d by Mr. Trump both damages and diminishes American institutions of government by making them \u201ctools of a personal political vendetta.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
