The U.S. Department of Justice said in 2017 he was among the \u201cupper echelon associates of Russian organized crime\u201d\u2014something Firtash vigorously denies, along with all charges against him.\n\nAs part of his legal defense, Firtash\u2019s lawyers have gathered documents that make controversial allegations against former special counsel Robert Mueller and former Vice President Joe Biden. Firtash\u2019s lawyers have passed these documents and other information to associates of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his frequent appearances on cable news, Giuliani has presented some of these documents to the American public as evidence for his claims of wrongdoing by Mueller and Biden. The key document is an affidavit from a former Ukrainian prosecutor who accuses Biden of corruption. \u201cThe witness I\u2019m relying on,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News on Oct. 6, was the prosecutor Viktor Shokin. \u201cThat\u2019s the affidavit I put out,\u201d Giuliani added. He did not mention that the affidavit was obtained by the Firtash legal team. At the beginning of the document, Shokin writes that he is making the statement \u201cat the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash.\u201d\n\nAsked about his ties to the Firtash legal team, Giuliani wrote in a text message to TIME on Tuesday: \u201cI do not represent Mr. Firtash and I have never met him.\u201d He did not reply to requests for further comment.\n\nOver the last two months, a TIME investigation has traced some of Giuliani\u2019s claims about Biden and Mueller to a troubling relationship, one in which a foreigner wanted by the U.S. government on corruption charges has taken steps, as part of his own legal strategy, that are helping the American President attack his most prominent critics.\n\nThis alignment of interests has taken shape at the same time, and with many of the same goals and actors, as the parallel effort by Trump and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden\u2019s family. The effort in Ukraine was brought to light in September in a complaint from an intelligence-community whistleblower. It is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry in Congress into alleged abuse of office by President Trump.\n\nNone of the inquiry\u2019s public proceedings so far have mentioned the assistance that Firtash\u2019s lawyers have provided to Giuliani. While they have said some documents from the Firtash case would be useful to Trump as a defense against his critics, the lawyers told TIME this summer that the purpose of the documents is to prove their client\u2019s innocence. Firtash\u2019s legal team has not responded since September to numerous requests for comment about their relationship with Giuliani.\n\nFirtash has established close ties to the former mayor of New York City in part by recruiting several of Giuliani\u2019s associates. In July the oligarch hired two lawyers who have been helping Giuliani in his campaign to discredit Trump\u2019s critics: Victoria Toensing and Joseph DiGenova, a married couple Trump considered hiring in 2018 as part of his private legal team. Best known as diehard defenders of Trump on Fox News, the couple has combed through the oligarch\u2019s case files and used some of them in the effort to defend Trump on television and in the press.\n\nToensing and DiGenova then hired another Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, to serve as their interpreter in communications with Firtash in Vienna, according to a statement the lawyers sent TIME on Oct. 11. While on his way to Vienna on Oct. 9, Parnas was arrested at Dulles Airport in Washington and charged with violating campaign finance laws. The indictment against him alleges that Parnas and his business partners secretly channeled money from an unidentified Russian donor to various political causes and candidates. Parnas has not entered a plea. His colleagues in the Firtash legal team declined to comment on the arrest.\n\nAttorney Kevin Downing, right, who is representing two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, walks out of a federal courthouse after a hearing in Alexandria, Va., on Oct. 10, 2019. Mark Wilson\u2014Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Giuliani said he has \u201cnothing to do with Firtash.\u201d He also denied ever speaking to Trump about the Firtash case. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure the president is aware of him,\u201d Giuliani told NBC. \u201cI think if you asked the president \u2018who is Dmitry Firtash?\u2019 He would say \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 As far as I know, we\u2019ve never discussed him.\u201d\n\nIn acting for Firtash, Toensing and DiGenova\u2019s stated aim has been to prevent their client\u2019s extradition to the U.S. In a phone interview with TIME on July 31, soon after joining the legal team, they said he should never risk facing an American jury. \u201cTrust me, it would be a disaster,\u201d Toensing said. \u201cThat\u2019s called a riverboat gamble,\u201d added her husband.\n\nBut the lawyers spent much of the interview talking about one of their favorite topics: the alleged abuses of the special counsel\u2019s office. They claimed that one of Mueller\u2019s top deputies in the special counsel investigation, Andrew Weissmann, offered to drop the bribery case against Firtash in 2017 in exchange for testimony that could be damaging to President Trump. This, they claimed, would amount to suborning perjury.\n\nThey declined to provide documents to back up those claims. In a piece published on July 22, John Solomon, a columnist for the Hill, cited documents from the Firtash legal team to suggest that Weissmann\u2019s attempts to turn Firtash were \u201cwrapped with complexity and intrigue far beyond the normal federal case.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer for President Trump, appears on \"Meet the Press\" in Washington, D.C., on April 21, 2019. William B. Plowman\u2014NBC NewsWire/Getty Images\n\nWeissmann, now a fellow at New York University\u2019s law school, did not respond to emails seeking comment. During his testimony before Congress in July, Mueller bristled at Republican attempts to question Weissmann\u2019s integrity, saying he was \u201cone of the more talented attorneys we have on board.\u201d\n\nDocuments from the Firtash case have become even more useful to Giuliani and Trump as they roll out their response to the impeachment inquiry. At the center of Giuliani\u2019s counterattack so far is the affidavit signed by Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general, which alleges that Biden caused Shokin\u2019s dismissal in order to stop a corruption probe into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat on the board of that company for about five years, reportedly earning $50,000 a month.\n\n\u201cI was forced to leave office, under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the U.S. Administration,\u201d in order to stop that investigation, Shokin said in the affidavit, which was notarized in Kiev on Sept. 4.\n\nThese claims have not stood up to scrutiny. Officials in the U.S. and Ukraine, as well as independent experts and investigative journalists, have said Shokin was fired because of his lax approach to fighting corruption. Shokin\u2019s successor as prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, has also said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine.\n\nBut Giuliani\u2019s defense of Trump amid the impeachment inquiry has relied heavily on the statement that Firtash\u2019s legal team obtained from Shokin. After reading some of its claims against Biden during an appearance on ABC in late September, Giuliani exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s under oath!\u201d\n\nThough their interests have aligned in recent months, Firtash and Giuliani come from starkly different backgrounds. The former mayor built his reputation in the 1990s fighting the Italian mafia in New York City. At around the same time, the tycoon was coming up through a business environment in Eastern Europe plagued by organized crime.\n\nBy the time the Department of Justice publicly referred to him in 2017 as a senior associate of the Russian mob, Firtash had been under investigation in the U.S. for more than a decade, according to interviews with his investigators.\n\nHis alleged ties to the Russian mafia go back to the early 2000s, when his work in the gas trade brought him into contact with Semyon Mogilevich, one of the most notorious leaders in the world of Russian organized crime. As Firtash later told the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, \u201che needed, and received, permission from Mogilevich when he established various businesses,\u201d according to a U.S. embassy cable published in 2010 by Wikileaks.\n\nIn an interview with TIME in 2017, Firtash confirmed that he knows Mogilevich, but denied ever doing business with him. \u201cHe was never my partner,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s Ukrainian\u2026 Half the country knows him. So what? Knowing him doesn\u2019t mean answering for him.\u201d\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Firtash had established himself as a partner to the Kremlin in the European gas trade. With the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin, his company had won exclusive rights to buy natural gas from Russia and resell it in Ukraine. Firtash owned about half of the company, while Gazprom, the Russian state gas monopoly, owned the other half. The arrangement made Firtash a billionaire.\n\nWith additional loans from Russian state banks, Firtash then bought up factories across Ukraine, especially in the chemicals and fertilizer industries, which helped make him an important powerbroker. In the presidential elections of 2010, he backed the Kremlin\u2019s preferred candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, and urged his factory bosses across the country to help get out the vote. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t voting for him,\u201d Firtash recalled of those elections in his interview with TIME. \u201cThey were voting for us. They know that politicians come and go. But we are still there with our businesses.\u201d\n\nWorking alongside Firtash in that campaign was the American political operative Paul Manafort, who helped engineer the Yanukovych victory. As the elections approached, Firtash and Manafort also pursued some business deals on the side. They discussed a plan in 2008 to buy the Drake Hotel in Manhattan in partnership with Brad Zackson, the real estate broker for Fred Trump, the President\u2019s father. But the deal fell through, Firtash says, because it was too much of a distraction. \u201cI thought, America is far away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not ours. We\u2019re busy over here.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort leaves his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on June 27, 2019. Yana Paskova\u2014Getty Images\n\nDuring the Yanukovych presidency, Firtash expanded his business empire, buying up control of lucrative gas distribution and storage companies in many parts of Ukraine. But his luck began to run out in February 2014, when violent street protests forced President Yanukovych to flee to Russia.\n\nA month later, Firtash was arrested near his mansion in Vienna on an arrest warrant issued by the FBI. The warrant accused him of organizing a scheme to bribe officials in India for the right to mine titanium. Because some of the metal was to be sold to a Chicago-based company, the District Attorney in that city claimed jurisdiction in the case under a law known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nFirtash has insisted the charges are politically motivated, part of an American effort to keep him out of Ukrainian politics. Since he was released on bail in Vienna in 2014\u2013after paying a bond of $174 million\u2013Firtash hired a formidable team of lawyers to stop his extradition from Vienna to Chicago. Among them is Michael Chertoff, the former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, as well as a former Austrian Justice Minister. Perhaps the most outspoken member of the legal team has been Lanny Davis, the former counsel to President Bill Clinton.\n\nOver the last five years, this team managed to slow the extradition process, but could not stop it. The case appeared to come to a head in early June, when Firtash\u2019s chief attorney in Chicago, Dan Webb, filed a motion warning that his client could be extradited in a matter of weeks.\n\nFirtash\u2019s lawyers, who declined at the time to speak on the record about their legal strategy, told TIME in June that the extradition looked imminent, and they were preparing to defend Firtash before a jury in Chicago. They also said, however, that they were ready to produce evidence that would embarrass officials from the Obama Administration. \u201cThis will be very tough against the previous Administration,\u201d one of Firtash\u2019s lawyers said at the end of June. \u201cWith the current Administration, I think they will like it.\u201d\n\nAt around the same time, Giuliani was busy with his global quest to find dirt on Trump\u2019s opponents. Two of his allies in the effort have been Toensing and DiGenova, his former colleagues from the Justice Department under the Reagan Administration.\n\nSince 2017, Toensing and DiGenova have been among Trump\u2019s most avid defenders on cable news in the fight against the Mueller investigation and other probes. Most recently, DiGenova called the impeachment inquiry \u201cregicide by another name\u201d during a Fox News appearance on Oct. 8, and referred to the intelligence-community whistleblowers as \u201csuicide bombers.\u201d\n\nThe pair have also worked closely with Giuliani in recent months. In early May, Toensing was due to join Giuliani on a trip to Kiev, where the two lawyers intended to pressure the new government in Ukraine to investigate the Biden family, according to a May 9, 2019, report in the New York Times. But the reporting about their plans caused such an uproar among Congressional Democrats that the two decided to cancel their trip.\n\nOn July 24, Firtash\u2019s lawyers in Vienna informed TIME of a dramatic change in his legal team: Davis, the former counsel to President Clinton, would no longer be working for Firtash. \u201cLanny is out,\u201d one of the lawyers wrote TIME in a text message on the night of July 24.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives at the White House in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 26, 2019. Gabriella Demczuk for TIME\n\nOne of the reasons for his departure, according to two people close to Firtash, was that Davis had been representing Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, since July 2018. That relationship had made Davis an enemy of Trump. Advised by Davis, Cohen had agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation, and he gave damning testimony against the President before Congress.\n\nIt would have been difficult after that for Davis to get along with Firtash\u2019s new lawyers, Toensing and DiGenova, who joined the legal team in late July, members of that team told TIME. (Davis did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAlongside Toensing and DiGenova, another long-time Republican operative began representing Firtash in July: Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for Trump\u2019s private defense team during the Mueller investigation.\n\nFirtash\u2019s representatives then began directing questions from journalists to Corallo. At the end of July, he arranged a phone interview for TIME with Toensing and DiGenova. During the conversation the lawyers seemed less interested in discussing their new client than they did attacking the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe Firtash case had given them plenty of talking points. \u201cI\u2019m almost done reading through the files,\u201d Toensing said over the sound of shuffling papers. Among the most interesting things she said she had found was a set of memos written in the summer of 2017 by Webb, Firtash\u2019s lawyer in Chicago.\n\nThe memos recounted a series of meetings that Webb had with Weissmann, the prosecutor from the special counsel\u2019s office, Toensing said. During these meetings, Weissmann allegedly offered to drop the charges against Firtash in exchange for evidence that could link Trump\u2019s campaign to the Kremlin, Toensing told TIME, citing the memos.\n\n\u201cThey were willing to use anybody to do anything,\u201d DiGenova added. Webb declined to comment.\n\nFirtash\u2019s legal team had been making such claims long before Toensing and DiGenova joined it. As early as December 2016, his lawyers had suggested to reporters in Vienna that the FBI was trying to turn Firtash into a cooperating witness against Trump. Firtash told TIME the following year that he had nothing to say to the FBI about the President\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia.\n\n\u201cMy problem is I don\u2019t know Trump,\u201d he said in the interview in Feb. 2017. \u201cI know Manafort, and I\u2019ve told you all I know about him. As for Putin, I\u2019ve got nothing to do with him. So what can I tell them? If I knew something, maybe it would be itching to get out of me. But I don\u2019t know these things.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The legal team for Firtash, who is wanted in the U.S. on corruption charges, handed material to associates of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani", "authors": ["Simon Shuster"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dmitry-firtash-ukraine-vienna-austria-office-2017.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
