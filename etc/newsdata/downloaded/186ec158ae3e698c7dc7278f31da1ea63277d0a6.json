This may seem obvious, but most of us don\u2019t really think about it.\n\nWhich is a tribute to the fact that television is a calculated and calculating business. It is highly competitive; very little is left to chance.\n\nBreakfast television is one of the most competitive two or three hours of the day. So if you\u2019re a presenter, you have certain qualities. One of those qualities is authenticity, or at least the fa\u00e7ade of it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

After all, this is a classic racist trope, almost comical in its antiquity, simplicity, and lack of just plain nous.\n\nThe four members of Congress that this chant in North Carolina was directed at are women of colour. Three out of four of them were born in the United States. So where they had to go back to was exactly where they already were.\n\nThis fact, nor the chant, would not have deterred a Trump Cultist, but would give a woman of colour presenting a breakfast telly show pause, to say the least. That she would then speak out would be natural in every way.\n\nSo when Naga Munchetty called the 45th president of the United States out for his comments, saying they were \"embedded in racism\", she knew exactly what she was doing. And she also would have expected her employer, at the very least, to not have given her any grief over it. After all, her employer is the BBC.\n\nSo how could it be that, after a formal complaint was made about both Naga and her co-host Dan Walker over impartiality, that only Naga faced the reprimand \u2013 a reprimand that has now been withdrawn by the corporation?\n\nI have had the pleasure and the honour of serving on two arts boards with Lord Hall as chair, before he was BBC director general. The man I know is a passionate and vocal advocate of diversity and against racism without hesitation. One of the boards I served on with him is one of the nation\u2019s main producers of the work of artists of colour: the Theatre Royal at Stratford East. Tony is no slouch in matters of race. He's all in.\n\nWhat I think is this: the Conservative Party happened to the BBC.\n\nSpecifically the Conservative Party of David Cameron. The former prime minister did not hide his detestation of the Beeb and all of its works, making the broadcaster arguably the first recipient, by inference, of the now infamous tag \u201cenemy of the people\u201d.\n\nThe corporation is sometimes like the slightly frightened lady in a Tennessee Williams play who depends on \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. This could explain its \u201cpearl-clutching\u201d at Naga\u2019s perfectly reasonable response to Trump. Being a woman of colour, she would have looked absurd if she had not responded as she did.\n\nUntil the institutions of our land put qualified (and there are plenty of us) people of colour in decision-making posts, ball-fumbling like this will long continue.\n\nThe BBC is no better nor any worse than another institution. But being no better nor worse is simply not good enough.\n\nIf the corporation cannot do better, be better than this, then the BBC Sounds that it will hear will be lots of us saying \u201cgoodbye\u201d.", "description": "The thing about breakfast television is that the people who present it are supposed to be people that you want in your home at that time of day.
