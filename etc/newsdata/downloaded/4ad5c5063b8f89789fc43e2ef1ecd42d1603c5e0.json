Typhoon Lingling knocked out power to more than 161,000 homes across South Korea, including on the southern island of Jeju, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said.\n\nNorth Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, said leader Kim Jong Un \"urgently convened\" an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss disaster prevention efforts and scolded government officials who he described as \"helpless against the typhoon, unaware of its seriousness and seized with easygoing sentiment.\"\n\nKim called for his military to drive national efforts to minimize damage from the typhoon, which he said would be an \"enormous struggle\" that would require the entire country to step up, the report said.\n\nNorth Korea, which suffers from severe food shortages, was paying \"primary attention\" to protect agricultural crops and prevent damage in dikes, dams and reservoirs, KCNA said. It said officials were also moving residents in areas vulnerable to flooding and deploying \"watchmen\" to monitor bridges, buildings and houses.\n\nPedestrians shield themselves from wind and rain brought by Typhoon Lingling Saturday, Sept. 7, 2019, in Pyongyang, North Korea.
