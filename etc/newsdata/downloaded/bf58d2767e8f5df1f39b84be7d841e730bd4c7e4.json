All three of its founders will have retired from the firm by year's end.\n\nIt has 400 employees globally, with $140 billion in assets under management. It offers investors everything from energy loans to European lending.\n\nAs GSO's last founder exits, its new leader, Dwight Scott, says it will now focus on what's known as direct lending, or giving loans to mid-size companies with no brokers involved.\n\nThese are safe bets in a downturn, he said, because Blackstone would be a senior creditor in the event of a bankruptcy.\n\nBlackstone expects to raise between $10 billion and $12 billion for direct lending by the end of the year, Scott said.\n\nGSO Capital Partners is going through its first big leadership handover since it was bought by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman's Blackstone 11 years ago.\n\nBack in 2008, the private equity firm picking up the credit hedge fund made sense for a number of reasons. There was a credit crisis unfolding and Blackstone could use an investing arm that could profit from it.\n\nOn paper, GSO had all the right qualities. It invested in distressed companies and was known for giving leveraged loans, which banks were already curtailing because of the crisis.\n\nOn top of that, Schwarzman had been trying to recruit GSO's top executive, Bennett Goodman, for years.\n\n\"I tried to hire him in 1999. Failed. I tried to hire him in 2004 before he went out on his own. Failed. And now here we are,\" Schwarzman told The Wall Street Journal in 2008, when announcing the acquisition.\n\nEver since Schwarzman made that purchase \u2014 paying $930 million for GSO \u2014 what was once a $10 billion fund with 100 professionals has ballooned into a sprawling $140 billion operation with 400 people.\n\nBut by year's end, all three of GSO's founders will have retired when Goodman relinquishes his role as senior managing director.\n\nNow, it seems as though Schwarzman's investment has come full circle as the US awaits another downturn. This time around, GSO is no longer a niche player, but a large investor with a wide variety of loans to offer companies. And as more PE firms have become lenders, questions have surfaced about how its portfolio will fare in the event of a recession.\n\nMeanwhile, the stakes have gotten higher. GSO has become a larger factor in Blackstone's overall performance, with its assets under management nipping at the heels of the core private equity ($174 billion) and real estate businesses ($157 billion) and many of its professionals placed into leadership roles.\n\n\"We have a big and growing team and a big and growing business,\" Dwight Scott, the new leader of GSO who is succeeding Goodman, told Business Insider in an interview, saying that the firm was \"very excited about what the future holds.\"\n\nDwight Scott, who is succeeding Bennett Goodman as GSO's leader Blackstone.\n\nToday, Blackstone's credit business includes distressed debt, or lending to troubled companies; mezzanine debt, loans that can consist of both debt and equity; direct lending, which gives loans to middle-market companies without the help of brokers; lending to energy and European companies; as well as fund finance, or giving loans to investors.\n\nScott, a 56-year-old North Carolina native who has been with GSO since its inception in 2005, oversees the entire operation. He has a mandate to keep growing the business in 2020, but it's no longer the same environment GSO operated in when Blackstone acquired it, as competitors such as TPG, Ares and Apollo have built out their own gigantic credit-investing platforms.\n\nAs the market has become more crowded, GSO has opened new offices in San Francisco and Toronto and brought on additional credit professionals in areas like distressed debt in order to tap new pools of business.\n\n\"It's kind of a prove yourself period,\" said one credit professional who works at a Blackstone competitor.\n\nBefore joining GSO in 2005, Scott was the chief financial officer of El Paso Corporation, an energy company that saw its stock plummet after the Enron fraud scandal as major investors exited, thinking El Paso's business was similar and prone to failure.\n\nAt the time, investors called for Scott's ouster. He likes to say the whole ordeal gave him a crash course in distressed lending, given that part of his job was securing financing for El Paso \u2014 an education that has proved useful at GSO.\n\nAfter settling into his role as president of GSO over the past two years \u2014 an appointment that helped transition work from Goodman to the firm \u2014 GSO has received a confidence score from Blackstone President Jon Gray of \"extremely high.\"\n\nGray told Business Insider that while there are more competitors as private lenders today, they are mostly \"smaller players,\" and he felt that the firm's broader portfolio of loans positions it well for a downturn.\n\n\"The question always comes up: 'Is that size a negative?'\" said Gray. \"We would answer, 'definitely not.'\"\n\nTo Gray, GSO's expansion in credit has meant an increased ability to bring in new business from a variety of avenues. This, he said, gives him confidence that GSO would perform well in a downturn.\n\n\"That is why we have had record inflows ... and record deployments,\" he said.\n\nLimiting risk\n\nOf course, with a credit unit as large as Blackstone is now, every bet can't be perfect.\n\nJust last year, GSO backed out of a controversial bet on home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc following an admonishment from US regulators.\n\nAfter providing Hovnanian with a loan, Blackstone took out insurance contracts wagering the company would default on its debts, and then persuaded Hovnanian to miss an interest payment, triggering a payout.\n\nBlackstone has acknowledged the deal was a mistake, and by all accounts, it was an exception to an otherwise strong track record. Blackstone says GSO has contributed to a total return of 232%, or 10.2% on an annualized basis, since its acquisition in 2008.\n\nBut as Scott looks to tack on new loans to its expanding portfolio, he must choose wisely to keep those return rates high. To limit risk, especially as economists foresee another downturn, Scott says he will focus on expanding Blackstone's direct lending business\u2014 a type of loan that protects the firm from losing money.\n\nIn a direct loan, Blackstone is a senior creditor, which makes the firm likely to get paid if the company went bankrupt.\n\n\"Where you have this long period of growth, you have the risk of a recession, you want to be protective,\" said Scott.\n\nBlackstone is currently raising a direct-lending fund, with hopes of reaching between $10 billion and $12 billion to devote to those loans by year's end, Scott said.\n\nCompetition heats up\n\nAnother challenge that has cropped up is competition, as other private equity firms such as Ares and Apollo have increased the number and size of loans they give companies.\n\nEver since the financial crisis, as big banks found their lending power handicapped by new regulations, private equity firms have stepped up to take their place.\n\nWhile some of the biggest private lenders have posed increased competition for GSO \u2014 such as Ares, Oaktree and Apollo \u2014 some of GSO's own people have also splintered off and formed their own funds.\n\nOne of the most significant was GSO founder Doug Ostrover, who departed in 2015 to launch Owl Rock, a fund devoted to direct lending -- the very business Scott would now like to expand.\n\nOwl Rock, with $13 billion in assets under management, went public in July.\n\nScott says that he believes the opportunities to lend to companies outnumber Blackstone competitors.\n\nBut beyond that, he says Blackstone's size sets itself apart, with a variety of lending options and what he holds up as a collaborative approach.\n\n\"Credit investors can be very much in your face. Very transactional,\" said Scott.\n\nIt is also willing to partner with other private equity firms as well, he said, pointing to Advent International's $5 billion purchase of Cobham, the British defense and aerospace group, a deal in which Blackstone GSO provided Advent with financing.\n\nAt the same time, GSO's growth within Blackstone has led to its collaboration with other parts of the business. That was seen in Blackstone's $1.6 billion purchase of 45 percent of North Dakota oil pipeline operator Targa Badlands LLC.\n\nThe deal, announced in February, was funded by a co-investment from Blackstone GSO and its private equity investing arm called \"tactical opportunities,\" which focuses on investment opportunities that are time-sensitive, complex or in dislocated markets.\n\nScott says he sees any upcoming downturn as an opportunity more than anything else. Soon, we'll see a wide range of troubled companies in need of financial support.\n\nBlackstone GSO currently has $25 billion just sitting on the sidelines, ready to be used for credit investments, Scott said.\n\n\"If the market corrects, the ability to put that $25 billion to work and make very interesting returns is real.\"", "description": "By year's end, all three founders of Blackstone's lending unit will have retired, handing off the reins to Dwight Scott, a 56-year-old Texan who is positioning the firm for a downturn.", "authors": ["Casey Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf16e74af909069d700483?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
