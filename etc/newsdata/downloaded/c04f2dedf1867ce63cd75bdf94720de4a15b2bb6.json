General Assembly, has died at 78.\n\nThe Portuguese government announced his death Thursday without providing further details.\n\nMr. Freitas do Amaral was a co-founder and the first leader of the Christian Democratic Party, which was formed soon after the Portuguese army coup of April 25, 1974. The coup leaders ousted a four-decade dictatorship and promised to introduce parliamentary democracy, but their ambitions were slowed by political turmoil.\n\nMr. Freitas do Amaral\u2019s party helped to balance out the far-left fervor, led by the Portuguese Communist Party, which surged after the ouster of the dictatorship set up in the 1930s by Antonio Salazar.\n\nMr. Freitas do Amaral was \u201cone of the founders of our democratic system,\u201d Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa said in a statement announcing his death, adding that his countrymen should \u201cbow in homage\u201d to him.\n\nMr. Freitas do Amaral played a central role in helping to steer Portugal away from its radical course in the post-revolution years, which coincided with the Cold War and triggered fears in Western Europe and the United States that the country, a NATO member, might align with Moscow.\n\n\n\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral in 2005. (Steven Governo/AP)\n\nAfter Portugal\u2019s first parliamentary elections with universal suffrage in 1976, Mr. Freitas do Amaral served in a series of governments as deputy prime minister, foreign minister and defense minister.\n\nHe was a key member of the Democratic Alliance, which drew moderates from various parties to stand together in a 1979 election. It won a majority in parliament.\n\nMr. Freitas do Amaral, a professor of law, was one of the driving forces behind a new Constitution approved in 1982.\n\nThe initial post-revolution Constitution of 1976 was inspired by Marxism, calling for the nationalization of the means of production. It also provided for the coup\u2019s military leaders to have an unelected power-sharing role in government.\n\nThe 1982 reform removed the ideological references, closed the military\u2019s path to power, opened up the economy and created the Constitutional Court.\n\nMr. Freitas do Amaral narrowly lost the 1986 presidential election to Socialist Party candidate M\u00e1rio Soares.\n\nHe served as president of the U.N. General Assembly between 1995 and 1996, where he pressed member nations \u2014 especially the United States \u2014 to pay their outstanding dues.\n\nHe also loudly opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nDespite his democratic credentials, Mr. Freitas do Amaral was shunned by the Christian Democrats \u2014 the party he helped create \u2014 after he accepted the post of foreign minister in a Socialist Party government in 2005. Christian Democrat officials took down his photograph from a wall in their Lisbon headquarters and mailed it across town to the Socialist Party. Mr. Freitas do Amaral said he was never again invited to a party event.\n\nDiogo Pinto Freitas do Amaral was born July 21, 1941, in Povoa de Varzim, Portugal. He received two law degrees from the University of Lisbon.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 44 years, the former Maria Jos\u00e9 Salgado Sarmento de Matos. They had four children. Complete information about survivors was not available.\n\n\u201cHe was a renowned jurist and scholar and a brilliant politician, wholly dedicated to public service, who left a very strong imprint as President of the United Nations General Assembly,\u201d said U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press", "description": "He was a Portuguese political leader and later was a top official at the United Nations.", "authors": ["Barry Hatton", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tCvF27uT48F6Hx7HNRS0R9DTXHQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/66SZC5HHU4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
