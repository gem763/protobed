She has been able to stay in active recovery for about 15 months by taking Suboxone, according to court documents.\n\nIndividuals who are taking drugs such as Suboxone can depend on them for years.\n\n\u201cIf Ms. Godsey is denied her prescribed Suboxone while she is incarcerated, she will inevitably suffer and possibly die,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nHer lawyers say she could go into withdrawal or relapse once she is released.\n\nOne reason prisons have resisted giving inmates the long-term treatment for opioid use disorder has been the cost, say legal scholars following the issue.\n\nSharon Dolovich, the director of prison law and policy at the UCLA School of Law, said it is a subject being widely litigated across the country, but she said it\u2019s unlikely to make it before the Supreme Court in the near future.\n\n\u201cUnder current Eighth Amendment doctrine, corrections officials can\u2019t opt for a course of treatment if it\u2019s known to be less effective, just because it\u2019s cheaper,\u201d she said.\n\nA representative for the Federal Bureau of Prisons refused to comment on the litigation, but said the agency recently began providing medication assistance treatment for some patients with opioid use disorder.\n\n\u201cThe Bureau of Prisons has a robust drug treatment strategy that includes cognitive behavioral therapy programs of varying intensity,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nGodsey\u2019s lawsuit comes after an Massachusetts inmate settled with the Bureau of Prisons in a similar case, with officials agreeing to provide methadone, a drug similar to Suboxone.\n\nAnd this month Kansas prison officials agreed to give one inmate buprenorphine, another drug to help opioid addicts.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
