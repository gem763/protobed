A year later, Zervos sued the then-president-elect for defamation, arguing that Trump falsely branded her a liar when he called her story \u201ctotally made up nonsense.\u201d\n\nNow, Zervos is saying that records provided during discovery by Trump\u2019s private company back up her story:\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump Sued by 'Apprentice' Alum Who Says He Grabbed Her Breast\n\n\u201c[Trump\u2019s] own records \u2014 produced for the first time in 2018, long after Ms. Zervos initially spoke out \u2014 strongly corroborate [her] account of the sexual assaults that [Trump] inflicted on her, and prove that [he] lied,\u201d Zervos\u2019 attorney wrote in a motion filed in New York Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nAmong the records at hand are emails between Zervos and Trump\u2019s assistant scheduling meetings between the two, which appear to line-up with the timeline Zervos provided in her 2016 public statement. Records also show that Trump stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel on the night of Dec. 21, 2007, the date and location of when Trump is accused of assaulting Zervos.\n\nFurther documentation provides \u201ceven more irrefutable proof that [Zervos\u2019] detailed account of her interactions with [Trump] is accurate,\u201d Zervos\u2019 attorney wrote. However, these records are still designated as confidential, and its contents have been redacted from public court filings.\n\nAlso Read: Trump to Provide Written Answers Under Oath in 'Apprentice' Contestant Defamation Lawsuit\n\nThursday\u2019s motion argues that the Trump Organization improperly used the \u201cconfidential\u201d designation to keep the records private, despite their failure to meet the legal standards that limit the scope of confidentiality.\n\nZervos is asking the judge to order the de-designation of the documents.\n\nAccording to Zervos\u2019 attorney, the sole basis for the confidential designation is that the records contain a personal cellphone number for Trump, which the president no longer uses. The motion also notes that the number has been widely publicized in the past, including on Trump\u2019s own Twitter account.\n\n\u201cThat argument is nothing short of absurd,\u201d Zervos\u2019 attorney wrote in the motion, going on to say that Trump \u201cevidently is aware that the documents at issue closely corroborate [Zervos\u2019] detailed account of their interactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not a valid reason for [Trump] to use the Confidentiality Stipulation to conceal the truth,\u201d Zavos\u2019 attorney wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRead original story Former \u2018Apprentice\u2019 Contestant Summer Zervos Says Trump Organization Records Back Up Her Sexual Assault Accusation At TheWrap", "description": "Summer Zervos, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who accused Donald Trump of groping her in 2007, now says that Trump Organization records provide \u201cirrefutable proof\u201d that her story is accurate and is asking a judge to unmark them as confidential.Zervos first came forward in 2016 to accuse Trump of", "authors": ["Reid Nakamura"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ar8h44V3x4MVxXL3zYjabg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/d16c173961966b7147a0960df68a755f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
