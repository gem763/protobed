The depositions are for former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker\u2014who resigned from his post last Friday\u2014Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nAll officials, except Kent, were named in the whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The whistleblower alleged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president into investigating the Bidens, and Democrats have claimed this appeared linked to U.S. military aid to Ukraine -- which Trump denies.\n\nSchiff has also scheduled closed-door testimony from intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who is slated to appear before the panel on Friday. Atkinson is the intelligence community watchdog who first received the whistleblower complaint and transmitted it to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nThe subpoenas and scheduled depositions come as part of the House's formal impeachment inquiry into the president, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced last week amid the chaos surrounding Trump's controversial July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump, on that call, sought for Zelensky to initiate an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. An intelligence community whistleblower alleged that Trump was soliciting foreign aid to benefit his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nThe transcript of the phone call, released by the White House last week, sought help in investigating the Bidens.\n\nFORMER US ATTORNEY SAYS THERE IS NO 'UNDERLYING' FEDERAL CRIME IN TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\n\nThe president, though, has maintained that he did not engage in any misconduct, and stands by his argument that there was nothing improper about the phone call -- instead blasting the Democrats, going so far as to call on Schiff, D-Calif., to resign.\n\n\"Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of, after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect), fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress, as though mine! He is sick!\" Trump tweeted Wednesday.\n\n\"All the Do Nothing Democrats are focused on is Impeaching the President for having a very good conversation with the Ukrainian President. I knew that many people were listening, even have a transcript. They have been at this \u201cstuff\u201d from the day I got elected. Bad for Country!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "House Democratic leaders announced Wednesday they plan to\u00a0subpoena the White House for documents related to any efforts to pressure Ukraine to probe Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
