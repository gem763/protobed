The dealings between the UK and the world\u2019s most populous country already represents a market worth more than \u00a366bn. Bilateral trade with China has reached peak levels, and the current Conservative government is convinced that the amount of goods and services exchanged between the two nations will multiply after Brexit.\n\nBeijing is certainty excited about the opportunities: a statement from China\u2019s commerce ministry last year announced that it had agreed to \u201cactively explore the possibility of discussing a top-notch free trade agreement between the two sides after Brexit\u201d.\n\nIn turn, Conservative ministers have put all considerations about the morality of such a deal to one side, focusing instead on their sacred cows of liberalisation and the free market in their negotiations with criminal regimes. Britain\u2019s arms exports to belligerent allies such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and India are frequently criticised, along with other states involved in the widespread persecution of racial and religious minorities.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe collusion with China raises matters to yet another grotesquely macabre level.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council has been told that China is actively selling human organs on an industrial scale, to be used in transplants. Evidence comes from the London-based China Tribunal, an independent body investigating and exposing the highly lucrative global trade in organ harvesting.\n\nComparisons with the Nazi regime are entirely appropriate when we consider that many of these organs have been harvested from those who are viewed as enemies of the Chinese state. They include members of the Falun Gong spiritual group, who practice a form of Buddhism. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party pledged to eradicate them 20 years ago, and the crackdown has continued unabated ever since. Tibetans and members of some Christian minorities are also suffering the same fate.\n\nNow Muslims are also high on the list of China\u2019s internal adversaries, with so-called \u201cre-education centres\u201d being used to incarcerate them. There are now more than 20 million Muslims in China \u2013 the figure still makes them a significant minority in a country with a total population of 1.4 billion \u2013 and many are Uighurs, an ethnic group that originated in Turkey.\n\nThe concentration camps contain Uighurs who have been interned without trial and are subjected to the most terrible abuses imaginable. The UN has been advised that the crimes against the Uighurs that have been \u201cproved beyond reasonable doubt\u201d include being operated upon while still alive, and having their ears, kidneys, livers, lungs, cornea and skin removed.\n\nA more cruel death is scarcely fathomable, and it is followed up by a victim\u2019s remains being packaged and sold off for use in transplant operations and medical testing.\n\nChillingly, the camps containing more than a million Uighurs in the Xinjiang province are used as mass organ \u201cbanks\u201d, where medics inspect the toll of dead prisoners and help themselves to useful parts from recently murdered human beings.\n\nBeijing denies any wrongdoing, claiming that the forensic proof levelled against it is the result of nothing more than \u201crumours\u201d. It admits that organs were taken out of executed prisoners up until 2015, but suggests that this practice has now stopped.\n\nYet Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the China Tribunal and prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia who led the case against Slobodan \u200bMilosevic, has heard compelling evidence from human rights and medical experts, as well as other witnesses about the Chinese organ trade. Quite rightly, he has said that the international community \u201ccan no longer avoid what it is inconvenient for them to admit\u201d.\n\nWhile China is earning an estimated \u00a3800m a year from its organ trade, countries such as Britain are looking forward to raking in far more in future Anglo-Sino economic transactions. So the UK will certainly play down the words of Hamid Sabi, a senior lawyer for the China Tribunal who, presenting their findings to the UN\u2019s Council in Geneva this week, said events inside China now amounted to the \u201cgenocide\u201d of racial and religious enemies. Sabi argued that these \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d were certainly comparable to the way the Nazis gassed the Jews, the way Rwandan Tutsis were butchered, and the manner in which the Khmer Rouge exterminated their foes. He called on the Council to take urgent action.\n\nLike China, Britain is a UN Member State. It is about time it took these barbarous acts seriously, and made the protection of human lives paramount in all trade relations.", "description": "As Britain contemplates a brave new era of international free trade beyond Europe, the People\u2019s Republic of China features prominently in its economic future.
