Thanks to B&Q, creating a haven at home doesn\u2019t have to involve timely or costly renovations.\n\nCarefully curated innovations, like the ones in store from the GoodHome range at B&Q, include everything you need for a fuss-free transformation, from durable paints in 80 complementing colours to flooring that fits seamlessly into any home. And with three for two on paint and three for two on flooring and tiles*, it\u2019s the perfect time to make some changes to your space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, with a few handy tips on how to get started, find out just how easy it is to make your home somewhere you feel happy\u2026\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nZone off different areas\n\nThe GoodHome report found that spaciousness is three times more important to us than the actual size of our homes, including the number of rooms and how many people we live with.\n\nSo, in order to create the perception of space in your home \u2013 without knocking through any walls \u2013 try coordinating colours, materials and finishes in pockets of the home that create a smooth flow through different zones.\n\nFor example, offsetting B&Q\u2019s Pahea Dark Grey Curtains and Pahea Dark Grey Cushions with something like the Pahea Yellow Cushions (\u00a312 at B&Q) could help distinguish a communal living room sofa from the armchair you set across the room for private reading and snoozing. By keeping the textures the same but changing the colours, you can find harmony in the asymmetry.\n\nAnd you can use paint to achieve this effect too. If you\u2019re working with a small space, keep the colours on your walls light and instead of doing a more traditional \u2018feature wall\u2019, create a focal point with a two tone design. It\u2019s easier than you think and you can really get experimental with geometric patterns and interesting colour combinations. Top tip: Keeping the paint closest to the ceiling pale will give the illusion of a taller room. For more of those handy hints, check out B&Q\u2019s step-by-step guide when painting a wall with multiple colours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChoose colours to boost moods\n\nWhen making a space your own, it\u2019s important that the ingredients you put in work well with the original features, like the layout, proportions and amount of light.\n\nSo, consider the right update for each space in your home, such as energetic, mood-boosting shades where you\u2019ve always lamented a lack of sunlight.\n\nThink about each room and what you use it for. What is the atmosphere you\u2019d like to create and how would you like to feel when you\u2019re spending time in there? Obviously, your bedroom is designed for sleeping, so darker, richer colours such as burgundy will help you feel cosy and relaxed \u2013 while stamping your own personality on the space. Deep shades are also traditionally romantic \u2013 perfect for the boudoir! Meanwhile, vibrant yellows are brilliant at helping to create energy and focus in zones such as a home office.
