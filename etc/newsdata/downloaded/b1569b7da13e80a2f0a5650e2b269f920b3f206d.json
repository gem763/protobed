REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nCentral bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings in Washington this week. Some also noted how far U.S. policy had shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF.\n\nAt that time, \u201cthe world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war,\u201d prompting then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank President David Malpass told attendees at a session this week.\n\nThe U.S. message then, Malpass said, was: \u201cFirst, there\u2019s no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone.\u201d\n\nAs the IMF\u2019s gathering of 189 member-nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. \u201cEverybody loses.\u201d\n\nThe United States, the world\u2019s largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world\u2019s largest exporter, 15 months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump is also in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade relationships with many of Washington\u2019s top trading partners.\n\nThe fallout will slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF estimated this week.\n\nThis pain is not being shared equally. The United States remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base. (Here's a graphic that shows the impact of tariffs in the United States and around the world. tmsnrt.rs/2OZJQba)\n\nEUROPE\u2019S PAIN\n\nThe damage is being particularly felt in European countries which \u201crely on exports and are open to trade,\u201d the European Union\u2019s Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.\n\nMore than 40% of Germany\u2019s GDP was derived from exports in 2018, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters.\n\nGerman trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for German exports in 2019 to just 0.5%, from 1.5%. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come.\n\nScholz said concerns over Britain\u2019s impending departure from the EU and the bloc\u2019s trade dispute with the United States were clearly dampening global economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure \u2013 specifically the reluctance to invest,\u201d Scholz said.\n\nThe pain is being felt in countries that don\u2019t rely on exports too, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what\u2019s been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened.\n\n\u201cWe have become dependent on tourism,\u201d explained \u00c1sgeir J\u00f3nsson, the governor of Iceland\u2019s central bank, with annual visitors growing five-fold to 2.5 million since the crisis. Foreign arrivals, however, have plummeted since the trade wars started, and are down 15.6% this summer from the year before.\n\nIceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, he said, but those are dropping too.\n\nTrade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows \u201cyou can never take global trade for granted,\u201d J\u00f3nsson said.\n\nNO AMERICAN IMMUNITY\n\nOn Friday, Japan\u2019s Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output in October.\n\nThe softness in production was largely due to car exports to the United States turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said at a briefing.\n\n\u201cThe pick-up in global growth is being delayed,\u201d Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said. \u201cJapan\u2019s economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that\u2019s affecting factory output.\u201d\n\nThe United States hasn\u2019t been immune from the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt.\n\nWashington\u2019s imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development.\n\nChristopher Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California, said bids for a $100 million infrastructure project in the city came in 80% higher than expected in part because of construction firms\u2019 need to factor in higher costs and the risk of additional tariffs in the future.\n\n\u201cEven in small cities like my own, we see the impacts of trade. We have come to realise the deep integration of our local economies in the global system,\u201d Cabaldon told Reuters ahead of the IMF and World Bank meetings.\n\n\u201cMost of my economic development plans ... are playing out on a global stage, not down the freeway.\u201d\n\nEMERGING MARKETS DISENGAGE\n\nThe trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. \u201cWe must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,\u201d said Ukur Yatani Kanacho, Kenya\u2019s acting cabinet secretary for treasury.\n\nAbdoulaye Daouda Diallo, the finance minister of Senegal, told reporters the U.S.-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said.\n\nOther emerging markets are also coming under pressure.\n\n\u201cUkrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,\u201d which drove down steel prices, said Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nMaking matters worse, \u201cthe intensification of geopolitical conflicts led to rising oil and natural gas prices in the world,\u201d she said.\n\nBahrain\u2019s Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said the Gulf region was also affected by trade tensions and the resulting slowdown in investment, although geopolitical concerns \u2013 about Iran, for example \u2013 were another major factor.\n\n\u201cTrade tensions create uncertainty and nobody is insulated from uncertainty,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nPeru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3% in August, from 4.2%, citing trade factors. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that its officials say might be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe Great Recession basically caught everybody by surprise, but economies were willing to cooperate and work together to pull it out,\u201d Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said. \u201cThis slowdown is taking nobody by surprise, but there is very little appetite for cooperation.\u201d", "description": "The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442800607&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0MG", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
