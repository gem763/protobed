Coins and art are the other two asset classes with double-digit price growth, up 12% and 10%, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, prices of rare whiskey climbed 35% year-over-year, according to Knight Frank, which uses data from Rare Whisky 101, a Scotland-based company that provides insight and intelligence to whiskey collectors and investors worldwide.\n\nThe slower growth rate in prices of rare whiskey during the second quarter is mainly due to a steep downturn in prices for The Macallan, coupled with plenty of supply, Andy Simpson of Rare Whisky 101 said in the report. (Whiskey is spelled with an \u201ce\u201d in the U.S. and Ireland, but not elsewhere.)\n\nBut he predicts rare whiskey will appreciate again during the rest of 2019. \u201cThings have since picked up significantly, so we\u2019re expecting a wholly better set of results at the year end,\u201d he said.\n\nA rare bottle of Brora sold for a record-breaking 54,450 at Sotheby's auction in London. Courtesy of Brora\n\nStrong Results from Sotheby\u2019s Whiskey Auction in London\n\nOne real-life sign of the market uptick was the Sotheby\u2019s whiskey auction online and live in London, which closed on Thursday.\n\nThe leading lot of the auction, a bottle of 1926, 60-year-old Macallan, fetched \u00a31.45 million (US$1.87 million) against a presale estimate of between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3450,000. The price sets a new auction record for any bottle of wine or spirit, according to Sotheby's.\n\nA rare bottle of single-malt Scotch whisky from the closed distillery of Brora sold for \u00a354,450, more than three times its high estimate of \u00a318,000 and also setting a record for the distillery.\n\nCelebrating its 200th anniversary this year, Brora closed in 1983 but is set to reopen next year, after a meticulous restoration over three years.\n\nSotheby\u2019s sale, titled \u201cThe Ultimate Whisky Collection\u201d from a single owner with more than 390 lots, realized a total of \u00a37.6 million, smashing the presale estimate of between \u00a33.3 million and \u00a34.6 million. The sell-through rate is 100%.\n\nClassic Cars Annual Return Slipped in Negative Territory\n\nDuring the 12 months from June 2018 to June 2019, jewelry and classic cars fared the worst, with prices falling 7% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThe main reason classic cars slipped into reverse gear is that speculative investors exited the market, while genuine enthusiasts were more circumspect about paying over the odds for vehicles, according to Knight Frank, citing Dietrich Hatlapa of HAGI, a London-based classic car research organization.\n\nLuxury Investment performance 10-year Vs. 1 year Knight Frank\n\nHowever, the long-term, 10-year return of classic cars is projected at 190%, ranking third in the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index, only after rare whiskey\u2019s 540% and coins\u2019 193%.\n\nRare whisky was first included in the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index at the end of 2018. The Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index\u2019s 10-year return is expected to have an average of 146%.", "description": "The spirit\u2019s value rose 23% annually, according to Knight Frank", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120442/social", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
