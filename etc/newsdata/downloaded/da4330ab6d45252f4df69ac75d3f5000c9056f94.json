Trade envoys from Beijing and Washington are still finalising the text for the two leaders to sign.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is also a White House advisor, told a panel at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \"have made a fabulous deal\" with Beijing.\n\nHowever, outstanding issues ranging from China's Uygur detention camps, the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest movement, and Beijing's likely reluctance to enforce agreements, threaten to prevent the two sides from stabilising the relationship, said Blanchette and Matthew Goodman, a senior vice-president and senior adviser for Asian economics at CSIS.\n\nLast year, China began drafting laws to encourage voluntary transfers of technology by foreign companies to local partners, but prohibiting such transfers by coercive administrative means, to address one of the US Trade Representative's key complaints.\n\nWhile China has shown increased resolve to protect the intellectual property of foreign companies operating there, the government has not yet been able to tackle violations, according to Goodman.\n\n\"They find it, for a variety of reasons, difficult in practice to enforce those laws, particularly on the local levels,\" Goodman said.\n\nAnd further reforms to the control that the Chinese government has over the economy, including the issue of subsidies, will be an obstacle further down the road, Blanchette said.\n\n\"Xi Jinping has been clear again and again that, unlike previous incarnations of Chinese leaders from Deng Xiaoping through Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, they're not looking to make fundamental reforms to the economic system away from state control,\" he explained.\n\n\"Nowhere in the negotiations have we really gotten close to making a dent in China's subsidies. This will be the sticking point. This is what's going to be so hard\" in efforts to resolve the trade war, he said.\n\nAfter escalating tariffs on each other's imports throughout the trade war that started in July last year, this month's agreement in Washington paused USTR's plan to impose an additional 5 per cent duty on US$250 billion worth of Chinese goods on October 15, which would have raised the levy to 30 per cent.\n\nNo decision was reached on whether fresh duties of 15 per cent on US$160 billion of largely consumer products, slated to take effect in December, would also be paused.\n\nAdditional reporting by Zhou Xin\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
