The case against Rose was placed in jeopardy when Fred, accused of 12 murders, committed suicide aged 53 in Winson Green prison in Birmingham\n\nIn other striking comments the solicitor:\n\nAlleges that when aged just 14, Rose may have been involved with Fred in the unsolved murder of schoolgirl Mary Bastholm, who vanished when aged 15 in 1968;\n\nClaims other unidentified victims of the Wests may have been unwittingly dumped at a rubbish tip by dustmen;\n\nReveals the murderer reacted calmly when he told her Fred had killed himself in jail;\n\nSays Rose enjoys prison life and does not wish to be released;\n\nAdds that the 'all-female environment suits' Rose's 'preferences'.\n\nBut it is his claim that Rose, who is now 65, enjoyed a fling with Hindley in Durham Prison in the mid-1990s that will attract most controversy.\n\nHindley, who in 1966 was convicted of the Moors Murders with lover Ian Brady, was held in Durham Prison in the mid-1990s at the same time as Rose West.\n\nThe chilling murders had made Hindley Britain's most notorious female killer, a 'status' threatened by Rose's 1995 convictions over the House of Horrors killings.\n\nYet the pair formed a sinister alliance after a chance encounter when West was remanded in custody at Durham Prison in 1995, according to Mr Goatley's book Understanding Fred & Rose West.\n\nPolice are pictured in the rear garden of Rose West's house in Gloucester. Fred West had claimed there were 20 more victims, but did not give precise details of the location of other remains, other than to talk vaguely about a 'farm' where he would take his captives\n\nThe remains of a body are pictured being carried from the West home on 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Mr Goatley writes that there is a consensus among experts that 'it is more than likely that there were other unknown victims of the Wests' reign of terror\n\nBased on 12 years of letters, interviews and visits with West, Mr Goatley's book states that the 'short-lived' affair took place on the female wing where prison officers had a policy of allowing 'open association'.\n\nMr Goatley writes: 'Rose's first paramour was the Moors murderer, Myra Hindley, who happened to be on the hospital wing at HMP Durham at the same time in 1995 and early 1996. Hindley was there because she had 'fallen over' in the exercise yard of F Wing. It was prison policy that a new inmate who was a lifer would first be assessed on the prison wing.\n\n'I recall that Rose was quite taken with Hindley, impressed by her knowledge and ability. Rose said Hindley had studied various Open University courses.\n\nHindley and Brady (pictured together above) were convicted in 1966 of killing ten-year-old Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans, 17. Brady also murdered 12-year-old John Kilbride, Hindley was convicted as an accessory to that murder\n\n'She said, 'Yeah, Myra, she's all right, we get on, I want to see how it goes'. This was a reference to a flowering, albeit short-lived, lesbian relationship.'\n\nMr Goatley adds: 'When I visited a few months later, Rose's opinion of Hindley had changed dramatically. She was saying, 'You have to watch Hindley, mind. She is very manipulative. You don't realise it, but she gets you doing stuff for her. Oh, she's clever, all right. She's flippin' dangerous, that one. She ain't going to take me for a c*** again.' And so heralded the end of the romance.'\n\nMr Goatley says the affair with Hindley was one of many female relationships West enjoyed from the start of her life sentence, adding: 'The friendships were genuinely supportive and often sexual. They could also be unstable and end in resentment.'\n\nHindley and Brady were convicted in 1966 of killing ten-year-old Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans, 17.\n\nBrady also murdered 12-year-old John Kilbride, Hindley was convicted as an accessory to that murder.\n\nHer \u2018contented\u2019 life in jail Leo Goatley says Rose West has found a \u2018strange contentment\u2019 in prison and enjoys a comfortable life there. The solicitor, who stopped acting for her in 2004, writes: \u2018I am aware that she has pictures of cats on her cell wall and that for some time she was allowed a budgerigar in a little cage in her room. I think of the budgie as safe and as secure in its incarceration as indeed Rose was. \u2018The chirpy little bird represented Rose\u2019s own strange contentment confined within her own gilded cage. I know Rose accepted prison as the location of her being, as her domain and her domicile.\u2019 Mr Goatley adds: \u2018The all-female environment also suited Rose\u2019s lesbian preferences, as her various relationships verify. She can sew and knit, prepare meals, watch television, make her cell space pretty much as she wants it. \u2018She said that she wanted to make a life for herself behind bars, that she had no wish to confront the media mayhem that would follow her around and visit her children if she was released.\u2019\n\nIn 1987, both confessed to killing Keith Bennett, 12, and Pauline Reade, 16. Hindley died aged 60 in 2002.\n\nAfter Rose West was convicted of ten murders in November 1995, the Daily Mail revealed in an exclusive front page story that she had formed a close friendship with Hindley \u2013 and that the pair had even been seen holding hands in jail.\n\nThe revelations prompted an angry response from Hindley, who made an ultimately unsuccessful complaint to the Press watchdog, alleging she was the victim of smears and lies.\n\nThe BBC was leaked a copy of her complaint and the case made headlines.\n\nThe chilling murders had made Hindley Britain's most notorious female killer, a 'status' threatened by Rose's 1995 convictions over the House of Horrors killings in 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, above\n\nMr Goatley first represented Rose in 1992, when she was accused of aiding and abetting Fred in the sexual abuse of one of their children. He continued to represent her until 2004 when it became clear she was making a life for herself in prison and no longer needed him.\n\nMr Goatley insists he has 'no regrets' over working with her, writing: 'She had as much right to proper legal representation as any other citizen.\n\nI did my professional duty in adhering to just and fair principles that everyone is entitled to a fair trial based on the law and facts of the case.'\n\nHe adds: 'The evidence was compelling that she was involved in serious sexual abuse, that she was married to a self-confessed serial killer, that she shared in his sado-masochistic perversion, that she had on occasions a foul temper. Should all that smoke automatically condemn her?'\n\nThe case against Rose was placed in jeopardy when Fred, accused of 12 murders, committed suicide aged 53 in Winson Green prison in Birmingham.\n\nWhen I visited her on January 1, 1995 to tell her that Fred had hanged himself, her expression, her demeanour and her body language were a complex compendium of conflicting signs,' writes Mr Goatley.\n\n'When I first told her, she was momentarily silent save for quiet gasp. I sensed an excitement at the prospect that this was a major development that somehow had tilted the future very much in her favour (an impression that was to be short-lived).\n\n'I detected also the welling of a lump in her throat and a tearful swell clouding her eyes that never became a stream on her cheek.'\n\nMr Goatley insists he has 'no regrets' over working with her, writing: 'She had as much right to proper legal representation as any other citizen. I did my professional duty in adhering to just and fair principles that everyone is entitled to a fair trial based on the law and facts of the case'\n\nMr Goatley believes that Rose may have been involved in the abduction and murder of teenager Mary Bastholm, who vanished aged 15 from a bus stop in Gloucester in 1968.\n\nHe suggests Rose, who was 14, already knew Fred by then and this could have been her first homicide experience.\n\nMr Goatley writes: 'When Fred was remanded in custody at Winson Green, he told his son Stephen that he had killed Mary Bastholm.\n\n'She [Rose] was an accomplice, albeit a junior accomplice, who may not have been present at the time of dismemberment, but in all probability was present at the time of death. She knew he was a killer.'\n\nMr Goatley writes that there is a consensus among experts that 'it is more than likely that there were other unknown victims of the Wests' reign of terror'.\n\nFred West had claimed there were 20 more victims, but did not give precise details of the location of other remains, other than to talk vaguely about a 'farm' where he would take his captives.\n\nMr Goatley writes: 'It is my belief that when Fred talked of other victims who were buried at a 'farm' near Gloucester, this was his cryptic way of intimating that victims who were killed at Cromwell Street were then dismembered, put in sacks and bin liner bags, thrown on the back of a dustcart and unwittingly taken to Hempsted Tip [on the edge of the city]. To the Wests, Hempsted Tip was a farm.'\n\nUnderstanding Fred & Rose West by Leo Samuel Goatley is published by The Book Guild on October 28.
