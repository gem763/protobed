Are he and his campaign up to it?", "language": "en", "text": "Other supporters caution that a more aggressive approach could cut against Biden\u2019s above-the-fray appeal and warn him against losing sight of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose steady march in popularity has eroded Biden\u2019s standing and given her narrow leads over him in several recent polls in early-voting states.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI do think things have changed. . . . You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump\u2019s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,\u201d said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden\u2019s who had senior roles in his two previous presidential campaigns. Rasky said he worries Biden\u2019s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.\n\nThe new demand that Biden simultaneously run a general-election matchup with Trump and a primary campaign against several formidable Democratic challengers risks straining a campaign that started later and has organized more slowly than some of his rivals\u2019 efforts.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign for now seems to have settled on an approach similar to the one Democrats used in the 2018 midterms, trying to ignore Trump as much as possible to focus instead on issues they believe are more resonant with voters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure. His campaign has sent out daily statements on health care and other issues, as if leaning toward predictability in a highly unpredictable time. Attempting to keep the focus on Trump, he has only sporadically talked about the attacks on him and his son Hunter.\n\nAt a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a \u201clying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,\u201d while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me. . . . It\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives,\u201d Biden said last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden has sent out a string of fundraising emails \u2014 which his campaign says resulted in its best donation week since early in the campaign \u2014 and some longtime confidants hope he can avoid getting dragged into Trump\u2019s bombastic antagonism. They have called or messaged Biden and urged him to avoid getting into a bitter back-and-forth with the president, reminding him that the political landscape is littered with foes whose character Trump has dirtied.\n\n\u201cFor Joe Biden to get down in the mud with this guy, whatever stank on him will run off on Joe,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter. \u201cHe\u2019s handling it the way he should \u2014 with restraint I could not handle on my best day. I mean, [Trump] is coming after his family. In my part of the country there would be fisticuffs over this.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is goading him,\u201d he added. \u201cBut if you want a Democratic Donald Trump who screams and yells and lies, then you need to vote for someone else. Because that isn\u2019t Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlready the Trump onslaught has had an impact on the Democratic side of the presidential race, overshadowing efforts by Biden and others to more pointedly put Warren on defense on a host of issues.\n\nYet the benefit to Biden, as some of his advisers see it, is the possibility that Democrats will view his response as statesmanlike and rally behind him amid attacks they see as unfair. So far they believe the approach is providing dividends.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden, Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are the three most important people in American politics right now,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa, who is neutral in the race. \u201cIt propels him to the limelight in ways that other folks don\u2019t get. It seems everybody else is playing catch-up; they are trying to get the limelight back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe impeachment proceedings underway in the House followed revelations that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son. The administration had previously held up congressionally approved aid to Ukraine, which is in the midst of a conflict with Russia after its invasion of the Ukrainian territory Crimea.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner earlier came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.\n\nHunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has delved into exaggeration and falsehoods in his fusillade of accusations against Biden. Yet the episode also has raised the uncomfortable question for Biden about whether he should have allowed his son to make money from a Ukrainian company at the same time he was overseeing the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on corruption there. Already, several of Biden\u2019s presidential foes have obliquely engaged on that topic.\n\nEd Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and a top Biden supporter, said he thought Biden has handled the issue \u201cjust perfectly\u201d so far, but he quickly added that it\u2019s hard to tell whether the accusations will have a lingering impact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats will think there\u2019s any truth to the attack,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cBut some might worry that if Biden gets elected, there will be all sorts of grand juries and Republicans will look into this stuff. . . . Not that Democrats believe Joe would do anything corrupt, but just that it would be charge and countercharge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe episode has crystallized an existing sense of anxiety among some of Biden\u2019s top donors and longtime supporters about his campaign. Some allies have been expressing concerns for weeks that Biden doesn\u2019t seem to be the happy warrior he had been in previous campaigns. They have urged him and the campaign to adopt a more assertive and focused message, one that puts the middle class front and center.\n\nSome of those worries have led to preliminary discussions, in Chicago and Washington, over whether to launch a pro-Biden super PAC. Biden\u2019s campaign has publicly discouraged any outside assistance, which could open him up to attacks from Warren and Sanders that he is being bankrolled by wealthy interests. Those discussions, first reported by the New York Times, are ongoing.\n\nAmong those involved have been Rasky; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama\u2019s campaign finance team in 2008 and was deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a sign of what Biden is up against, the Trump campaign announced Friday the $10 million ad campaign focused on Biden, his son and Ukraine. It includes a video snippet of Biden saying the United States would withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if Ukraine did not fire the corrupt prosecutor.\n\n\u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cThey lost the election. Now they want to steal this one. Don\u2019t let them.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign has attempted to reassure donors and has sent out talking points to allies to encourage a public response to Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and Donald Trump just revealed to the entire world how terrified he is that he\u2019ll lose it to Joe Biden,\u201d Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s because the contrast between the vice president and Donald Trump couldn\u2019t be more powerful.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks,urging them not to book Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. \u201cBy giving [Giuliani] your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u201d the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.\n\nWhile conceding that they are in a highly unpredictable environment, Biden advisers believe their candidate will ultimately benefit from contrasts with Trump over issues and leadership.\n\n\u201cA lot of us who know Joe Biden think it\u2019s incredibly unfair,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a tactic some folks have used in the past to gain political advantage, and . . . we shouldn\u2019t allow that. As voters we should say, \u2018Hell, no, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nVilsack, who remains uncommitted in the Democratic primary, said voters should focus on how Biden has avoided getting caught up in personal attacks. He added that the current environment is showcasing what a general election between the two men would look like \u2014 which could calm voters.\n\n\u201cThe Biden campaign seems to be able to handle the attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know what the attacks about these other candidates are going to be.\u201d\n\nSome Biden allies privately draw a contrast with Warren, and Trump\u2019s assault over her past claims of Native American heritage. Afterward, she dropped rapidly in the polls; she has risen steadily over the past six months at a time when Biden was bearing the brunt of Trump\u2019s criticism.\n\nAlan Feirer, the party chairman in Madison County in Iowa, has expressed some skepticism of Biden in the past but said he is impressed by how he handled the past week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been reminded what a statesman he is, because he hasn\u2019t risen to the bait of what Trump was presenting over the past few days,\u201d said Feirer, who is staying neutral. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s instilled doubt or anything. If anything it\u2019s instilled more confidence and reminded people why they like him. He\u2019s been classy.\u201d\n\nAnnie Linskey and Michelle Ye Hee Lee contributed to this report.", "description": "Biden has maintained a focus on issues and only sporadically defended himself and his son Hunter, but the impact of Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated accusations remains unknown.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/raD_iaFj2SMamM8PWb0YVsupAK0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QQJOGJHCJAI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
