Sotashe said the ANC would endeavour to have the report discussed in the open.\n\nThe ANC was also unhappy about the City's performance when it came to housing, and Sotashe said the national government took back an R175m grant because the City failed to spend it.\n\nThe EFF and Democratic Independent Party also said they would not support the adjustment budget because it did not serve the people, especially the poor people, of Cape Town. ACDP councillor Demetri Dudley supported it and said the ACDP has asked for an increased budget for safety and security.\n\nThe budget was passed by 143 votes to 59, with no abstentions.\n\nAfter the vote, Plato went outside to listen to people protesting about service delivery outside the civic centre, flanked by Sotashe and ANC councillor Khaya Yozi.\n\nPlato said he would visit their communities to listen to their concerns, with the appropriate mayoral committee members in attendance.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The City of Cape Town has passed an adjustment budget that would make a further R165m available for safety and security, despite the ANC's objections that it is only a reward for \"sheriff\" JP Smith for the role he played in removing former mayor Patricia de Lille.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8390/b4ccfe45e5f74f8a965ac2d4a01bfbe4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-31"}
