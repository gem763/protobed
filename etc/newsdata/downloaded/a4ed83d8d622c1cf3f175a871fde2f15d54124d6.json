He planned to trek some 8,300 kilometers across Russia before arriving at the gates of the Kremlin in 2021.\n\n\u201cGod told me that Putin is not a man, that he is a demon, and that I must exorcise him,\u201d Gabyshev, 51, said during his journey, which was covered by a number of Russian-language media outlets. \u201cThere can be no democracy with the demon [in power].\u201d\n\nGabyshev had trekked almost 3,000km, gathering around two dozen followers along the way, before his arrest at a makeshift camp in eastern Siberia\u2019s republic of Buryatia on Thursday.\n\n\u201cArmed security services blocked the highway, quickly encircled our camp and headed straight to the shaman\u2019s tent,\u201d Viktor Yegorov, one of Gabyshev\u2019s supporters, said in a video from the scene. \u201cThey drove him off in an unknown direction.\u201d\n\nRussian state media reported he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital in Yakutsk for observation.\n\nAmnesty International quickly condemned the arrest and labeled the anti-Putin shaman a \"prisoner of conscience.\"\n\n\u201cThe shaman\u2019s actions may be eccentric, but the Russian authorities\u2019 response is grotesque. Are they truly afraid of his magical powers?\u201d Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty\u2019s Russia\u2019s director, said in a statement.\n\nInvestigators later confirmed Gabyshev had been detained and would be flown back to Yakutsk, where they said he is wanted in connection with an unspecified crime. He may also be charged with forming an extremist organization, an offense punishable by up to 10 years behind bars, according to several unconfirmed reports.\n\nOn Friday, Russian state media reported he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital in Yakutsk for observation, a move some critics likened to the Soviet-era use of punitive psychiatry to incarcerate dissidents for indefinite periods.\n\n\"His forced confinement in a psychiatric hospital is a blatant violation of his rights,\" said Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based associate director for Human Rights Watch\u2019s Europe and Central Asia division. \"His actions involved no danger to society or public order.\"\n\nThe shaman's arrest came just days after he told Russia\u2019s Znak news website he would build up an \u201carmy\u201d to drive Putin from power. Online videos showed ordinary Russians greeting Gabyshev and providing him with provisions as he and his followers made their way to Moscow.\n\n\u201cHere he is \u2014 the great Putin,\u201d Alexei Navalny, the prominent Kremlin critic, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe was so afraid of the shaman from Yakutia that he had him arrested by 20 people with automatic weapons.\u201d\n\nDmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, declined to comment on Gabyshev\u2019s arrest.\n\nGabyshev\u2019s trek across Russia coincided with the biggest opposition protests in Moscow for almost a decade and a dramatic slump in support for United Russia, Putin\u2019s ruling party, amid growing poverty and allegations of high-level corruption.\n\nAlexei Kondaurov, a retired KGB major-general and former lawmaker, said government officials were spooked by the prospect of Gabyshev traveling on through some of Russia\u2019s most economically depressed regions with an open message of insurrection.\n\n\u201cThe authorities in the regions, like no one else, sense the growing domestic discontent,\u201d according to Kondaurov.\n\nEarlier this month, the arrest of some of the shaman\u2019s supporters in Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia, triggered three days of protests that also saw demands for a rerun of allegedly rigged elections for governor. In Chita, a city in eastern Siberia, Gabyshev spoke to around 1,000 protesters at an opposition rally that was one of the biggest there in recent years. The Russian Orthodox Church, a key Kremlin ally, threatened to excommunicate anyone who attended.\n\n'The shaman's curse'\n\nShamanism \u2014 the practice of communicating with what adherents believe to be the spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness \u2014 has roots stretching back centuries in Siberia. Followers defied attempts by Soviet authorities to stamp it out and the religion has made a comeback in Russia in recent decades.\n\nBut not everyone in the community was on board with Gabyshev's foray into politics. In August, the shaman was confronted on the outskirts of Ulan-Ude by a group of pro-government shamans who accused him of spreading discord.\n\n\u201c[Shamans] do not care about politics. We need harmony. We do not need a bloody war,\u201d one of them told him in remarkable scenes reminiscent of images from bygone centuries (smartphones aside).\n\nAs news of Gabyshev\u2019s arrest broke on Thursday, opposition supporters began posting the hashtag \"#I/We are the Shaman\" on social media, a reference to a recent successful grassroots campaign to free Ivan Golunov, an investigative journalist who police tried to frame on drug-dealing charges.\n\nThe collision of the occult and the political sphere is not new in Russia, a country with a deep-rooted fascination with the paranormal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived to see this. A shaman as a victim of political repression,\u201d Yelena Lukyanova, a professor at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThere is about as much chance of replacing the authorities through elections as there is by the shaman\u2019s curse,\u201d Igor Eidman, a Kremlin critic, posted on Facebook. \u201cYet, they have been jailing [opposition] candidates for a long time, so it\u2019s only natural they have now started on shamans.\u201d\n\nThe collision of the occult and the political sphere is not new in Russia, a country with a deep-rooted fascination with the paranormal. Russia\u2019s Academy of Sciences estimates that 67 percent of all Russian women have at some time sought help from a \u201cpsychic or sorcerer.\u201d The figure for Russian men is one in four.\n\nThat fascination has leeched into politics. In the late 1980s, as the Soviet system began to crumble, state television broadcast so-called \u201chealing sessions\u201d by Anatoly Kashpirovsky, a Kremlin-approved \u201cpsychic healer.\u201d Kashpirovsky was later elected to the State Duma, Russia\u2019s parliament.\n\nUnder Putin, Grigory Grabovoi, another self-proclaimed psychic healer, sparked outrage when he claimed to be able to resurrect the 186 children killed in the 2004 Beslan school siege. Grabovoi\u2019s actions trigged allegations he had been tasked by Kremlin spin doctors with discrediting the Beslan Mothers, a group of bereaved parents asking uncomfortable questions about the government\u2019s handling of the incident.\n\nMore recently, it emerged that the Kremlin had funded a secret mind-reading division in the 1990s. One of its \u201cdiscoveries\u201d was that Madeleine Albright, the former U.S. Secretary of State, believed it was \u201cunfair\u201d Russia had sole possession of Siberia and its vast natural resources. Boris Ratnikov, a retired general, said the \u201cdiscovery\u201d was made by a psychic agent who \u201cread\u201d Albright\u2019s mind. Putin repeated the claim at a press conference in 2014, although it is unclear if he was aware of its source.\n\n\u201cThe most frightening thing is that [the political elite] really saw a threat in the shaman\u2019s campaign,\u201d wrote Lev Rubinstein, a Russian poet and Kremlin critic.\n\n\u201cThey really believe in shamans and wizards \u2026 and what if that shaman had stronger connections with important spirits than their shaman?
