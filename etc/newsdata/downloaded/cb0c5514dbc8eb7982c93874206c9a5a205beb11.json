The request, which came amid a holdup of congressionally authorized military aid to Ukraine, is now at the center of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nHill worked on the National Security Council overseeing U.S. policy toward Russia and is a longtime critic of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, in stark contrast to a president who has openly challenged the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump. A fluent Russian speaker, Hill helped engineer the administration\u2019s harsh response to a Russian chemical attack in the U.K., among other internal efforts to promote a more skeptical approach to Moscow.\n\nHill\u2019s closed-door appearance kicks off another busy week for the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is set to testify on Thursday, and the week is riddled with deadlines for document requests and subpoenas to government agencies and officials, an indication of Democrats\u2019 breakneck pace as they build a case against Trump.\n\nIt was unclear if the White House sought to block Hill from testifying, as it has for other former officials who have been summoned before the House this year. She concluded her government work just days before Trump\u2019s fateful phone call with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe State Department initially blocked Sondland from appearing before the House\u2019s impeachment investigators last week, but after receiving a subpoena, Sondland\u2019s attorney says his client will appear before the three committees spearheading the probe on Thursday.\n\nText messages provided to the committees by Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, show that Sondland was deeply involved in talks surrounding Trump\u2019s desire for Ukrainian officials to probe Biden and to assist the Justice Department in its investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation \u2014 a top target of Trump and his allies.\n\nUnlike Hill, Sondland is a political appointee who donated to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and his inaugural committee. The Washington Post reported that Sondland was expected to tell Congress that Trump himself dictated one of the text messages to his fellow diplomats in which he stated that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine involving military aid.", "description": "Fiona Hill worked on the National Security Council overseeing U.S. policy toward Russia and is a longtime critic of Vladimir Putin.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180519954-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
