Here's how", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nChilly February temperatures didn\u2019t deter Genevieve Monette and her husband, David Hatfield, from putting their Cranford, New Jersey, townhouse on the market.\n\nGood thing, too, since their home quickly became a hot property that drew multiple offers.\n\n\u201cWe painted the townhouse, refinished the floors, changed the light fixtures and within the first two hours of it being listed we had seven visitors scheduled,\u201d says Monette, who adds that the couple upsized into a larger home with their 13-year-old son.\n\nA limited number of homes on the market and the seriousness of buyers looking in February helped the family sell quickly and for a full price at $267,000, Monette says. Another big part of their success was getting their property in model-home condition, allowing them to unload the townhouse fast even as another in their complex languished for months.\n\nWhy corporate pensions are endangered: 4 reasons for their disappearance\n\nBed, Bath & Beyond:As more stores close, what you need to know about coupons, returns and gift cards\n\nA 2019 photo showing Genevieve Monette with her husband and son in New Jersey. (Photo: Courtesy of Genevieve Monette)\n\n\u201cSelling in the early fall and winter can be an advantage,\u201d says Jeffrey Fagan, regional vice president of Watson Realty Group in Orlando, Florida, and president of the Orlando Regional Realtor Association. \u201cThe buyers who are looking are serious, motivated buyers. In addition, there\u2019s less competition from other sellers.\u201d\n\nFagan, who has been a real estate agent since 2001, says that the number of homes for sale across the country typically drops by about 15% in November and December.\n\n\u201cEven though the number of people looking at homes and the number of homes for sale are lower, sales are pretty steady, even in fall and winter,\u201d says Sharon Steele, a real estate agent for 12 years with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Cranford and Westfield, New Jersey.\n\nIn her market, 271 homes were under contract from October through December in 2018. She said 267 were under contract from January through March 2019, while 267 were under contract from July through September of 2019.\n\nPricing in the off-season\n\nSteele says it may be possible to test the waters a bit with a slightly higher price in the off-season because there are fewer homes available, particularly if you\u2019re selling in January or February.\n\n\u201cA lot of people start looking after New Year\u2019s because they\u2019re working on their budget, want to start on a New Year\u2019s resolution and have less activities than during the holidays,\u201d Steele says.\n\nMonette says they listed their townhouse at the price of a similar one that sold in July.\n\nSome buyers are motivated to accept a higher price because of employment trends in the winter, says Fagan.\n\n\u201cJob transfers occur often around the holidays as businesses get ready for a new year, plus families want to get their kids settled before a new semester starts,\u201d he says.\n\nTips to attract buyers in fall and winter\n\nAttracting a buyer to your home requires a little extra effort in the off-season, particularly because days are shorter and tough weather can discourage buyers from touring your property.\n\nSuggestions for giving your home added appeal include:\n\n\u2022 Decorate for warmth. Celebrate the holidays as you would, says Fagan, but tone it down a little to create an environment where buyers can see themselves celebrating.\n\n\u2022 Upgrade your house photos. Buyers will try to minimize their travel time in winter and will look online first. It\u2019s essential to have professional photos with proper lighting, says Fagan. Steele recommends having photos that showcase your home's landscaping in other seasons.\n\n\u2022 Focus on lighting. An abundance of exterior and interior lights are essential when showing your home at dusk or later, says Steele. She recommends putting in higher wattage light bulbs that provide a warm but not harsh light. Not every light needs to be on, but you should have at least one light in every room, Fagan says.\n\n\u2022 Make your house cozy. While you still need to declutter for potential buyers, Steele says soft blankets and extra pillows in the living room and bedrooms make a house inviting in the winter. If you have a fireplace, use it during open houses and showings.\n\n\u2022 Showcase energy efficiency. Buyers are apt to think more about heating bills in the winter, so provide written information about energy-efficient improvements you\u2019ve made, and your average utility bills.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/08/homes-sale-how-tips-for-selling-your-house-offseason/3864121002/", "description": "A limited number of homes on the market and the seriousness of buyers can make a home sale in fall or winter a success.
