Alex Ellinghausen\n\nLabor is trying to hide its own political relief as it contrasts the government\u2019s \u201ccomplacency\u201d with its own willingness in office to follow the advice of then Treasury Secretary Ken Henry to \u201cgo early, go hard, go households\u201d in response to the global financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThis government is going slowly, going soft and going nowhere when it comes to an economic plan,\u201d Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese declared. This charge does, of course, recall the rather unhappy legacy of Labor\u2019s era in government as well as the party\u2019s spectacular inability to persuade voters last May of the benefits of its own economic plan.\n\nBut it gives Labor a chance to argue the next round of tax cuts should be brought forward to help a \u201cfloundering economy\u201d \u2013 a counter to relentless Coalition mockery about the disastrous economic impact of the opposition\u2019s high-taxing alternative.\n\nDespite the opposition\u2019s criticisms, it\u2019s hard to finger the Morrison government for particular ineptitude given the Australian economy is part of a global \u201csynchronised slowdown\u201d, as described by the IMF, and provoked by much larger forces, including one Donald Trump and his trade war with China.\n\nBut the argument over the urgent need for greater fiscal stimulus is certainly not confined to domestic political partisanship. Just ask Philip Lowe. Even if he\u2019s more polite about it than Albanese, it\u2019s clear the Reserve Bank governor doesn\u2019t think relying on lower interest rates and government as usual from the Coalition will be enough to get inflation up and unemployment down. And that\u2019s with RBA growth forecasts, like those of Treasury, still being considerably more optimistic than those of the IMF World Economic Outlook.\n\nFormer Treasurer Peter Costello, the deficit-cutting supremo of the 1990s, is certainly not in favour of more spending. But he backs Lowe\u2019s argument about the much-reduced impact of monetary policy these days, telling a conference on Wednesday it has \u201crun its race\u201d .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what comes in its place? Promised structural reforms are still only promises and with a long time frame.\n\nThe Morrison government\u2019s refusal to change course on spending leaves Frydenberg arguing a \u201cstrong budget position is not mutually exclusive from having a strong economy\u201d. The catch is the domestic economy is clearly not strong enough despite the big increase in jobs over the last several years.\n\nMorrison cites the advantages of \u201cstable and disciplined financial management\u201d compared with the \u201creckless spending and waste\u201d of Labor in government operating in panic and crisis. He points to various scandals like Labor\u2019s \u201coverpriced\u201d school halls and pink batts program.\n\nIt\u2019s still obvious IMF forecasts don\u2019t make happy bedtime reading for any Australian treasurer, even if most of the developed world\u2019s other finance ministers, from Greece to Germany, would be just about as miserable. Australia\u2019s expected growth comes in at 19th position out of the 34 OECD countries.\n\nThe IMF has called on all governments to use a combination of spending and structural reforms to lift economic growth and international trade.\n\n\"Monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. It should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available, and policy is not already too expansionary,\" the IMF said.\n\nIn that global context, Australia\u2019s budget surplus looks anything but overly expansionary \u2013 rather the reverse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInnes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, was particularly blunt about what he thinks is required.\n\n\u201cOur economy needs a spark to regain momentum and rebuild confidence to combat the local and international pressures which are a drag on business and consumer confidence,\u201d he declared.\n\n\"It is time for Australia\u2019s governments \u2013 at the federal, state, territory and local levels \u2013 to work more effectively together to impart a more active stimulus than is currently in the pipeline. There is a clear place for a sensible acceleration of \u2018shovel-ready\u2019 infrastructure investment and public works. There is also a strong case to closely consider bringing forward the scheduled program of income tax relief.\u201d\n\nThe federal government is stressing it wants to work with the states on rolling out a decade-long, $100 billion pipeline of infrastructure projects \"as quickly as possible\" but cautions about capacity constraints and the need to look at smaller projects and upgrades.\n\nAnyone for more tax cuts?", "description": "Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison are trying to polish a political message looking ever more battered by economic reality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5277%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_719%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/287328096fd5ccaeb0c857b506724efbc0066b78", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
