Street consensus had been $432.3 million in revenue and non-GAAP profit of four cents a share. The company said it had 3.2 million clients at the end of the quarter, up 18% year over year.\n\nFor its fiscal first quarter, Stitch Fix projects revenue of $438 million to $442 million, up 20% to 21%, below the previous Street consensus of $451 million. The company sees adjusted Ebitda, which excludes stock-based compensation, of $6 million to $9 million. The company doesn\u2019t provide earnings-per-share guidance.\n\nFor the 2020 fiscal year ending next August, Stitch Fix expects revenue of $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion, with adjusted Ebitda of $85 million to $105 million. Street consensus was for $1.91 billion.\n\nIn an interview with Barron\u2019s this afternoon, StitchFix President and Chief Operating Officer Mike Smith said the company was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the fourth-quarter results, with revenue at the high end of the range. He\u2019s also upbeat on full-year guidance, anticipating top-line growth consistent with the company\u2019s long-term target of 23% to 25%.\n\nSmith also notes that the company has plans for \u201cfairly robust investment in data science and engineering\u201d as it adds new personalization capability, including its new Style Shuffle feature and a \u201cdirect buy\u201d feature now being tested with some customers that looks a little more like traditional online retail shopping.\n\n\u201cClients can request these items on our app or website, and the items are then delivered directly without a styling fee,\u201d the company said in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe are excited to offer clients more of the pieces they love in a personalized and convenient manner, and have been pleased with the early engagement and positive client feedback.\u201d\n\nSmith said one reason for the lighter-than-expected November quarter guidance is that the summer selling season lasted longer than expected, while fall goods have higher average selling prices. (Sweaters have higher prices than T-shirts, for example.) He says they have not seen any impact from their business from a softening consumer economy\u2014but he adds that when a downturn comes, StitchFix should hold up better than other retailers.\n\nIn after-hours trading around 5 p.m. Eastern time, Stitch Fix shares were down 1% at $19.87. The stock rose 4.2% to $20.06 in regular trading, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
