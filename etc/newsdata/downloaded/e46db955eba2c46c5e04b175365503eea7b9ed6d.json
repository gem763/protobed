So we took up the season\u2019s challenge with a range of machines to figure out which ones are best to arm yourself with this autumn.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The ergonomics are faultless on this model with a lightweight rig strapping to your back featuring chest and hip belts, which transfers the weight of the battery evenly and doesn\u2019t leave you with an aching back even after an extended period.\n\nThe considered design continues in the actual blower arm, which features a flexible tube that makes the nozzle easy to operate and direct the powerful 145mph airflow, which runs from 320cfm to 600cfm. That meant that we had no problem shifting dry materials with the power dialled down and denser, wetter patches of debris were broken up easily when we turned on the machine\u2019s turbo mode.\n\nBuy now\n\nSpear & Jackson S30BLV corded leaf blower and vac: \u00a360, Argos\n\nThis electric machine packs a heavyweight punch with an unparalleled blast of air (186mph) for its price category. We had no problem getting rid of anything that the season deposited on us with the machine easily clearing 300sqm of lawn and patio in 45 minutes, without us having to worry about losing power. The blower is well designed for a prolonged assault on the garden with vacuum and shredding functions just a flick of a switch away. Added value comes with a three-year guarantee and if you add an extension lead to the already generous 10M long cable, it\u2019s even a solid option for anyone with a larger lawn area.\n\nBuy now\n\nWorx WG505E triviac garden blower mulcher & vacuum: \u00a379.99, Amazon\n\nThis corded machine will take the backache out of your garden duties in the next few weeks with its triple function of blowing, vacuuming and mulching any material you pick up. The 210mph air speed is more than enough to steer debris where you need it and even clear out twigs and leaves that have found their way into gravel paths, while the 350cfm capacity dealt with clumps of wet leaves and tangled twig piles. Interestingly, you carry the bag separately over your shoulder, which helps to distribute the weight and means that it doesn\u2019t drag on the ground as you work. The metal shredding blade also does a very efficient job of slicing and dicing even harder materials like hawthorn twigs.\n\nBuy now\n\nStihl BGA100 cordless leaf blower: \u00a3274.28, World of Power\n\nYou can leave the ear defenders hanging in the garage when you pick up this handheld battery model because even though it will deliver air at an impressive 494cfm and at 167mph, it is an impressively quiet machine. Efficient and well balanced, it has three power modes for delivering the air plus a boost option if you need some extra muscle. Perfect for urban patches and longer clean-ups so you won\u2019t come in from the garden with your ears buzzing, it\u2019s even been awarded a Quiet Mark, which is the internationally recognised award programme for low noise, high performance equipment.\n\nBuy now\n\nWorx WG547E cordless air turbine garden leaf blower: \u00a399.99, Amazon\n\nThe air turbine fan in this battery powered machine delivers 129mph air speed and 430cfm making it a very powerful and affordable product, but the motor eats up the battery life quite quickly, so it\u2019s probably best to buy a spare battery to prolong operating time. The two-speed control makes it easy to switch from clearing out the mulch from delicate flower beds to going all out on the airflow for piling up wet leaves on a front lawn.\n\nBuy now\n\nEgo LB5800E blower: \u00a3169, Ego Power Plus\n\nHandheld and highly portable, this is a real powerhouse of a blower, delivering air at an eye-watering 580cfm. There\u2019s no delay in the airflow when you hit the trigger and the blower feels light and nicely balanced once the battery clicks into place. Due to the hurricane-like blast it delivers there\u2019s very little that it won\u2019t be able to deal with in the garden. We found that its power combined with good direction from the nozzle ensured we weren\u2019t just sending leaf litter up into the air only to have it land back in the same place again.\n\nBuy now\n\nBlack & Decker GW3031BP garden vacuum and leaf blower with backpack: \u00a379.95, Tooled Up\n\nThis excellent electric option \u2013 which boasts a scarecrow-shredding 260mph of wind speed \u2013 is so well-powered that you\u2019re not going to have any trouble rounding up the most stubborn leaves or even ensuring that larger tree twigs, cones and seeds end up exactly where you want them. Once you\u2019ve finished rounding up your garden garbage you can simply switch out the blow tube for a suction fitting and start hoovering it all up into the voluminous 50L collection sack that sits comfortably on your back. There\u2019s even an ingenious rake attachment for the vacuum tube in case you come across a leaf that doesn\u2019t want to play ball. The only thing that you\u2019re going to be limited by is the length of your extension lead.\n\nBuy now\n\nHusqvarna 525BX leaf blower: \u00a3295, Husqvarna\n\nOne of the major advantages of this model is that it\u2019s incredibly lightweight for a petrol powered blower, so you can work for hours on end without feeling like your arm\u2019s about to fall off. The spring-loaded handle is separated from the body of the machine, so vibration is minimised which enhances the comfort factor. The 192mph wind speed is more than a match for wet or dry leaf litter while interchangeable tubes, one round and one flat, means that it can deal with tight channels and gutters that might collect debris as well as larger areas of lawn.\n\nBuy now\n\nBosch ALS 2500 electric blower and vacuum: \u00a359.40, Amazon\n\nThis electric model is still good value for money if you\u2019ve got a small backyard to keep tidy. It blows with enough power (186mph) to herd damp leaves into a manageable pile and then vacuums them up, without any blockages, into a sizeable 45L detachable bag. Unlike some other vacuums we tested the bag hangs underneath the vacuum tube so it doesn\u2019t get in the way when walking around and is easily emptied.\n\nBuy now\n\nRyobi OBL18JB 18V one+ cordless jet blower: \u00a363.70, Amazon\n\nGiving the Bosch a real run for its (value for) money is this battery operated Ryobi that acquitted itself particularly well in the wet as it boasts a narrow focus tube that had no trouble moving soggy leaves and grass cuttings.\n\nA good variable speed throttle is sensitive enough so that you can instantly go from full power, (around 100mph) to a more delicate stream. The machine is powered by a one+ battery, so if you already own any of the one+ tools this adds to the product\u2019s value as the battery is interchangeable. If not, the battery and charger will cost around \u00a3110.\n\nBuy now\n\nStihl BR350: \u00a3328, Green Machinery Direct\n\nThis backpack petrol blower is a serious bit of kit if you\u2019re intent on battling with a large garden. It\u2019s a breeze to start, so you won\u2019t have to fight with the engine\u2019s pull chain and once you\u2019re up and running it\u2019s very comfortable to use, with the weight of the blower\u2019s body, evenly distributed with adjustable padded straps. The 1L tank will keep you blowing for up to two hours, which is plenty of time to get your plot in line without having to refuel.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nRyobi OBV18 18V one+ cordless brushless blow vac: \u00a3130.96, Amazon\n\nThis is a powerful blower that makes it easy to direct leaves exactly where you want them, but the standout feature here is that with just a flick of a switch you can turn it into an efficient garden vacuum without having to wrestle with lots of replacement tubes. There is even a set of wheels on the end of the tube so you can use it like a traditional vacuum on flat surfaces like patios or driveways. The machine\u2019s blades will turn the litter into mulch, which you can collect in a 45L sack and recycle back onto your garden or compost heap. Plus, it\u2019s compatible with the Ryobi one+ system. If you don\u2019t already own one you need to add around \u00a3110 for the battery and charger.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Leaf blowers\n\nIt may look like a prop from a Ghostbusters film but the Ego LB6002E has all the advantages of a backpack blower minus the ear defenders, fuel cans and fuss. The powerful air stream is easily controlled and it's so comfortable to use that it will appeal to all kinds of gardeners.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
