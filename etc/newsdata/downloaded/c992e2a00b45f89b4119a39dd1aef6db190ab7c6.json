The now-famous picture depicts a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy Messier 87, 54million light years away from Earth. The image shows a bright ring formed as light bends in the intense gravity around a black hole that is 6.5billion times more massive than the Sun\n\n'The fact that we now see this in three systems strengthens the idea that it is a unifying characteristic of such growing black holes,' Mr Paice said.\n\n'If true, this must be telling us something fundamental about how plasma flows around black holes operate.\n\n'Our best ideas invoke a deep connection between inspiralling and outflowing bits of the plasma.\n\n'But these are extreme physical conditions that we cannot replicate in Earth laboratories, and we don\u2019t understand how nature manages this. Such data will be crucial for homing in on the correct theory.'\n\nThe team published their findings in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters.", "description": "Astronomers from the University of Southampton used their own telescope observations and radiation data from a NASA instrument on the ISS to create the detailed video.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/13/wire-19587626-1570797271-483_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
