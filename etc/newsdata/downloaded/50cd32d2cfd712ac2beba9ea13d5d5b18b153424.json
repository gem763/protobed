I entirely agree with you that there is no place in modern society for language that seeks to divide us.\n\n\u2018All Liberal Democrat MPs and their staff are expected to undertake the \u201cValuing Everyone\u201d training which was put in place as part of the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Ms Butler is unimpressed with the Lib Dem reaction, which comes 20 days after the column was written.\n\nShe said: \u2018It has taken almost three weeks to get a one-line apology from Steven Wilson and what\u2019s clear from this is he was forced to do so. It\u2019s disappointing that it only came after my formal complaint to the Liberal Democrats\n\n\u2018It\u2019s still unclear however, whether Jo Swinson has followed her party\u2019s disciplinary procedure and taken action against Steven Wilson; he should be disciplined for his behaviour and be required to undergo diversity training.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
