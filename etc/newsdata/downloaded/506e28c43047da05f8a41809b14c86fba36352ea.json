Soon after, security staff told all retail staff to close their doors and move the public to the back of the stores.'\n\nFootage recorded by a bus passenger shows one police officer handcuffing a suspect on the pavement outside, after another policeman stunned him with a Taser.\n\nA force spokesman later confirmed a man in his 40s is being questioned on suspicion of serious assault and detectives are 'keeping an open mind about the motivation'.
