(Image: Kirk Scroggs, Steve Wands, DC Comics)\n\nLike most kids his age, Russell Wainwright \u2014 the hero of Kirk Scroggs\u2019 upcoming The Secret Spiral of Swamp Kid \u2014 is going through some wild physical and emotional transformations that his parents can only understand but so much. Unlike his peers, though, Russell\u2019s transformation has less to do with the human hormones in his blood stream and more to do with his mysterious connection to a local swamp.\n\nBut before Russell can begin using his abilities to become whatever it is that he wants to be when he grows up (no one has has to become a superhero just because their powers are similar to an established hero\u2019s), he\u2019s got to figure out just what\u2019s going on with his body after it starts reacting strangely to the presence of plant life.\n\nIn this preview, we\u2019re introduced to Russell\u2019s friends and family as they all rally around the kid just in time to participate in a series of \u201cexperiments\u201d that would come pretty damn-near close to being body horrific, were it not for the charming way Scroggs has illustrated the book.\n\nThe cover of The Secret Spiral of Swamp Kid.
