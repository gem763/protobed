Analysts polled by FactSet predicted $6.34 billion.\n\nGlobal revenue increased 4.2% from the year earlier on a comparable basis, which excludes currency fluctuations, mergers and asset sales, the company said. That was slower than the 4.6% gain Mondelez notched in the second quarter.\n\nThe company said it expanded distribution of its products in discount and club stores in the U.S. and boosted distribution of items like gum in Chinese stores. It raised prices 2.1% in the quarter and grew sales volumes by the same amount.\n\nMondelez reported a profit of $1.42 billion, or 98 cents a share, up from $1.19 billion, or 81 cents a share, last year.\n\nThe company's profit of 64 cents a share, following adjustments, exceeded expectations by four cents.\n\nMondelez also said it now expects comparable revenue to grow more than 3.5% this year, up from a previous forecast of a gain of more than 3%. Adjusted earnings could rise up to 7%, excluding currency fluctuations.\n\nShares fell 1.8% in after-hours trading.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 17:02 ET (21:02 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
