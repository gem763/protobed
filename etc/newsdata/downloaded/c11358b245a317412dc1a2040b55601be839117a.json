REUTERS/Christinne Muschi\n\nThe test is being implemented by Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u2019s Coalition d\u2019avenir Quebec (CAQ) government. CAQ, a nationalist center-right party, won a majority government in 2018\u2019s provincial election, soundly defeating the province\u2019s two establishment parties.\n\nCAQ ran on a platform including cutting immigration to the predominantly French-speaking province. Quebec is allowed some leeway by the federal government to set its own immigration levels, to protect its distinct identity within the country.\n\nLegault\u2019s government has come under fire internationally for implementing a ban on public employees in positions of authority wearing religious symbols such as Muslim hijabs and Jewish kippahs to work.\n\nIt is that law the test is intended to make sure that potential immigrants understand, Legault told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important in Quebec because we are a nation, we are a distinct society, we have our values, we have our charter,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ban is being challenged in court by civil rights groups, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during the recent federal election campaign he would consider a federal challenge to it.\n\nLegault described the test as similar to one that exists at the federal level, where individuals applying for Canadian citizenship must pass a test on Canada\u2019s history and laws, among other topics.\n\nAn individual must score at least 75% to pass the test that covers \u201cdemocratic values and the Qu\u00e9bec values expressed by (Quebec\u2019s) Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms,\u201d the government\u2019s official publication said.\n\nThe test would only apply to economic immigrants and their families, not refugees.\n\nLegault\u2019s government also raised the immigration target in 2020 to between 43,000 and 44,500, from 40,000 in 2019. Quebec is Canada\u2019s largest province by area and the second biggest by population, behind Ontario.\n\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des chambres de commerce du Qu\u00e9bec (FCCQ), the major business lobby in the province, said in August the province would need about 60,000 immigrants annually to meet current labour shortages.\n\nThe lobby said it was disappointed in the immigration measures announced.\n\n\u201cWe were clear and loquacious about the needs of businesses in the face of labour shortages,\u201d St\u00e9phane Forget, president and chief executive of the FCCQ, said in a news release in French on Wednesday, adding that one of the solutions to the labour shortage was an increase in immigration levels.", "description": "Quebec will require immigrants seeking permanent residency in the Canadian province to pass a \"values\" test to ensure they understand its new secularism law, the provincial government said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446701967&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T21L", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
