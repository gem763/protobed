But the mention of it inspires him to endorse its predecessor, Jurassic World, by making dinosaur noises and declaring momentary attraction to a CGI raptor.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s made the case for Jurassic World. It\u2019s probably closer to the 100th.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Movies (and Other Things) by Shea Serrano. Photograph: Arturo Torres and Twelve Books\n\nThe teacher-cum-writer\u2019s passion for popular culture has fueled two New York Times bestsellers and now probably a third, Movies (and Other Things), which was published this week in the US and will come out in the UK on 31 October.\n\nThe 256-page book finds the San Antonio, Texas-based author answering questions such as \u201cWho gets it the worst in Kill Bill?\u201d and which characters from seminal high school movies of the 90s and early 2000s would be friends with Regina George, the classic Mean Girls villain.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking notes and you\u2019re so invested in the material and then it just comes out in your regular life, where that\u2019s all you want to talk about,\u201d Serrano told the Guardian on publication day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to lunch with my cousin Gary, who I hang out with all the time, and I have 100 Regina George thoughts to run by him. And he\u2019s like, \u2018All right, you gotta fucking relax.\u2019\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re so invested in the material and then it just comes out in your regular life Shea Serrano\n\nSuch intense behavior has, however, cemented Serrano as one of the most successful culture writers of the decade. His Basketball (and Other Things) was one of Barack Obama\u2019s favorite books of 2017 and The Rap Year Book is being turned into a documentary for AMC, the network responsible for Mad Men and Breaking Bad.\n\nIf Movies (and Other Things) also becomes a New York Times bestseller, Serrano and illustrator Arturo Torres will be the first Mexican-Americans to have three books attain such hallowed status.\n\nSerrano is supported by the FOH (Fuck Outta Here) army, a tribe of 302,000 Twitter followers who drive both book sales \u2013 The Rap Year Book sold out on Amazon and Barnes & Noble within two days of release four years ago \u2013 and philanthropic projects.\n\nTee and jam: two books treat hip-hop history with welcome irreverence Read more\n\nIn December 2016, for example, they raised $3,000 to tip a parking attendant who helped Serrano find his car at an airport. In March 2017, they raised $12,500 for Planned Parenthood and to help a former student of Serrano\u2019s pay for a trip to Turkey to teach English. They have directed thousands to support teachers on the website Donors Choose, to an LGBTQ youth center in San Antonio and to raise money for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.\n\nSerrano said people frequently tell him such projects are one of the only nice things they see on social media. That hasn\u2019t stopped him, however, from injecting politics into the mix.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Who gets it the worst in Kill Bill?\u2019 Photograph: Arturo Torres\n\nShortly after the election of a president who announced his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists, Serrano made clear he despises Donald Trump. Some followers argue his Twitter feed should not be political or should not alienate those with a different political opinion. He responds automatically: if they support Trump, they should not follow him.\n\nSerrano said he felt an obligation to make his position clear and decided it was worth whatever impact it had on his book sales.\n\n\u201cAt some point, you are either going to say something or not going to say something,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cI knew very early on there were not a lot of Mexicans in the places I was and I can\u2019t not say something.\u201d\n\nThis does not seem to have dented his appeal. On the night of his latest release, at least 300 people wrapped around a block in Brooklyn to see Serrano speak at Books Are Magic, a small independent store. Other stops on his tour are drawing similar crowds.\n\nIt is an amazing result for someone who did not plan to be a professional writer.\n\nSerrano and his wife, Larami, planned to spend their lives teaching. But she was put on bed rest for four months while pregnant and they were left with one salary that could barely cover rent.\n\n\u201cWe were getting beat up,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cWe needed more money.\u201d\n\nSerrano started to write for paid-content sites, local newspapers and alt weeklies. An editor at the beloved culture and sports website Grantland asked him to pitch stories and eventually he was offered a full-time job. The site closed three months later but Serrano had found his devoted following.\n\n\u201cThis has been how my career works,\u201d he said. \u201cFalling into things by accident.\u201d", "description": "The former teacher\u2019s passion for popular culture has fueled two New York Times bestsellers and he\u2019s hoping for a third", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8166e3a4e37ad9a9765a33d8a6c408038b680b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2435d76480b64a781fcf93dc17901d65", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
