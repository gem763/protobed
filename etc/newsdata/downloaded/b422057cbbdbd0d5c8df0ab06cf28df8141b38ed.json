There is no denying that it\u2019s impossible to share every minute detail in a relationship, but a certain level of transparency is healthy. However, what if you find yourself in a situation wherein your partner is overly secretive? \u201cI was in love with a man who seemed affectionate and loyal. Initially, he made me feel like a queen \u2014 showering me with gifts, frequently taking me out for dinner, and calling me every hour to know how I was doing. Yet something was amiss\u2014for instance, he never introduced me to his parents or sister,\u201d recalls Vaani Pinto, a former airline staff member, based in Chennai. Suspicions grew stronger as he continued to avoid discussing his family with her. Pinto then decided to do some sleuthing herself. She got his address from friends, and landed at his residence while he was at work. To her utter dismay, she found that her partner was a married man with kids\u2014a fact he skilfully hid.From concealing illicit sexual activity, problems at work, to debts, there are several secrets which, when unravelled, can leave you shattered. Look out for the signs below.Picture this: You strongly feel your partner is keeping things from you, and decide to confront him with direct questions. When you do so, take note of his expressions\u2014sometimes they can give away all you need. Experts say that there are a number of facial expressions and associated reactions which indicate someone is lying, and a few of these can be caused by nervousness. \u201cLook for reduced eye contact. Check if he\u2019s frowning\u2014eyebrows lean towards centre of the forehead,\u201d says Shamim Deshmukh, a Mumbai-based psychologist and graphologist. She also says a person's eyes darting back and forth, shifting towards the right ear as if he is \u201cconstructing a picture in his mind\u201d is suspicious. The signs in totality are part of a physiological reaction that indicates he\u2019s uncomfortable facing your questions. \u201cA sudden stiffness in the body to quell his nervous energy is also common,\u201d says Ritika Aggarwal Mehta, consultant psychologist at Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai.Reema Singhania*a food entrepreneur based in Kolkata, remembers how her ex used to resort to a barrage of counter-accusations when she tried to call his bluff. The man was accused of harassment by several women in his workplaces\u2014he changed jobs frequently\u2014but she was kept in the dark for the longest time. But when Singhania found out, all hell broke loose. \u201cHe began listing out my previous affairs as if I had cheated on him. However, the fact is, I never hid my past from him.\u201d Experts say this is common behaviour of people who are bent on hiding things from their near and dear ones. \u201cIn fact, he may accuse you of lying to him,\u201d warns Mehta.It\u2019s not out of place for your significant other to not live up to certain expectations. However, if he overcompensates, consider this as a red flag. Pinto faced it with her partner. \u201cOnce, he missed a date due to work deadlines. The next day, he got me flowers with a gift and began cosying up. I did think it was too much for a missed date,\u201d she says. Deshmukh states \u201ccompensating in kind\u201d is the standard practice of those economical with the truth.Disclosing every financial detail is not a parameter of a successful relationship. But, a reluctance to share any transactions or downright lying about money may indicate that he is dealing with a fiasco. \u201cMy ex was in a debt trap. He was robbing Peter to pay Paul! Whenever I tried to ask him how much money he owed, he would say that he had already paid creditors off. Of course, this was far from the truth,\u201d says Meera Saha, a teacher in a private school in Kolkata. Experts say sometimes people can lie because they are too embarrassed about certain aspects of their lives, such as their weak financial situation. \u201cSome may even fear being judged. So, either they try avoiding certain topics or when pressured into talking about it, they may cover it up with lies\u2013they may believe telling the truth will only make matters worse,\u201d explains Mehta. In other words, try to find out what your partner is really embarrassed about.Is your man suddenly overloading you with unnecessary details about where he was or what he was doing? Experts say you shouldn\u2019t take these voluntary disclosures as a sudden burst of \u201ctruthfulness\u201d; it could just be subterfuge and bluff. Essentially, he could be offering a barrage of useless information to distract you and cover up his guilt. \u201cNote the tone of his voice; he could be talking excessively, repeating phrases or giving surplus information. The person could also be changing conversation topics rapidly in order to distract you,\u201d cautions Mehta.- His past relationships may have scarred him. For instance, he might have been honest or transparent, but this quality may not have been appreciated or reciprocated.- He might be suffering from low self-esteem. This can be a genuine concern, according to experts. Due of low self-esteem, he might be covering up his flaws.- He finds it difficult to trust anyone easily. Again, this may have been caused by past experiences. His ex might have betrayed him. And that has made him extra secretive.- He may have grown up with controlling parents and speaking up was discouraged. So he is used to keeping things to himself.- Don't assume the worst. Don\u2019t be too suspicious either. Ask yourself if you are reading too much into it.- Tell him how his 'secrets' are affecting you. Needless to say, if you constantly feel that your partner is hiding things from you, you may start to feel exasperated.- Don't be too confrontational; take a solution-oriented approach. If you start blaming him, he may not open up about why he is being secretive. Instead, think how you can help him explain his behaviour.- Try to know why he's lying; there may be some genuine concerns. Sit him down fora heart to heart chat. Try to delve into his past.- Seek couple counselling, if things go out of hand. Maybe your partner would be more comfortable opening up to a counsellor, who can also help in diagnosing what\u2019s ailing him.*Names have been changed on request", "description": "Is your partner playing secret games?
