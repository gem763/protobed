Now we are at that stage where we want to become number one in the world again.\u201d\n\nA final against New Zealand or England, who play on Saturday, would be another huge mountain to climb for whoever comes out on top but both sets of players will be desperate to give themselves a chance to take on that challenge.", "description": "With South Africa feeling they are close to perfecting their attritional game-plan and Wales having long ago decided that defence can be the best form of attack, Sunday's second World Cup semi-final will probably not bring many surprises.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444857005&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0ZM-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
