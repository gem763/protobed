He just looked drained, he was just depleted, he wasn\u2019t getting the nutrients.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had the dark circles under his eyes, there was even a little grayness to his skin,\" Will added. \"We got really nervous, but [he is] definitely looking better now.\u201d\n\nJaden then shared he's current a vegetarian, not a vegan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m vegetarian, I have tried to eat vegan meals,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go vegan for a week or so but for the past year I\u2019ve been vegetarian.
