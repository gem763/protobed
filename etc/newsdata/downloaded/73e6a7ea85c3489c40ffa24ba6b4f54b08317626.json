Parliament\u2019s rejection of a snap election came as a new law went into effect on Monday blocking Mr. Johnson from pursuing a \u201cno deal\u201d withdrawal from the European Union.\n\nParliament is now suspended until mid-October, the result of earlier political maneuvering by the prime minister. But by Monday\u2019s end, it seemed clear that if Mr. Johnson had thought he could outfox Parliament by suspending it, sidelining lawmakers at a critical moment in the Brexit debate, he was the one who had been outmaneuvered.\n\nNow, the man who promised to deliver Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union \u201cdo or die,\u201d formal withdrawal agreement or not, is suddenly flailing for a new strategy.", "description": "Monday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Britain\u2019s new prime minister.
