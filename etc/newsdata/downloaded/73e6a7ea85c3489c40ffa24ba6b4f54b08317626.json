Mr. Johnson had thought he could outfox Parliament by suspending it and controlling the Brexit timetable, but he is the one who has been outmaneuvered.\n\nIn the waning hours of their last day in session until mid-October, lawmakers were poised to deliver yet another defeat: the rejection of the prime minister\u2019s bid for a snap election. And that loss came on the same day a new law rammed through by Parliament took effect that prevents him from carrying through on his threat to force through a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNow, the man who promised to deliver Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union \u201cdo or die\u201d is suddenly flailing for a new strategy, more than three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum.", "description": "Monday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Britain\u2019s new prime minister.
