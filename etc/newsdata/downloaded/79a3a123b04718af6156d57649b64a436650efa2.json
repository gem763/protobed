Lots of fungi spreading spores this time of year.'\n\nThe woman replied and said she does keep her pits by a window, which could explain the fungal growth, but it is always closed.\n\nAnother person said the mother did not need to worry: 'It\u2019s the normal breakdown of the potting medium, just keep watering them.
