Even as we get used to what seems like an ever-expanding range of coffees, this diversity of taste and flavor could disappear. Poverty, the impact of climate change and the spread of disease are driving small coffee farmers out of business \u2015 and leaving your morning brew in the hands of mass producers.\n\nOnce diversity is gone, it won\u2019t be replenished. Earlier this year, researchers revealed that 60% of all wild coffee species are under threat of extinction due to deforestation, climate change, and the increasing severity of fungal pathogens and pests.\n\nThe result will be consumers waking up in the morning to far less choice, warned Peter Kettler, a senior coffee manager at Fairtrade International, which works to protect the interests of farmers in lower-income countries. That would be a loss, he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people today who are looking to coffee for more than just a caffeine delivery service.\u201d\n\nCoffee is big business, worth around $90 billion globally. Americans drink more than 400 million cups every day and U.S. coffee consumption has increased by nearly 3% over the past four years. Global production also continues to rise, led by Brazil and Vietnam, which together already produce more than half of all the coffee in the world.\n\nBut an oversupply has helped push global coffee prices close to their lowest level in a decade. With dropping prices, farmers \u2015 particularly those operating the small farms that make up much of production in developing countries like Honduras and Burundi \u2015 are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nFarmworkers pick Arabica coffee beans in Gigante, Colombia.

Today\u2019s market price of less than $1 per pound is significantly below the $1.20 to $1.50 that Kettler said growers in poorer countries such as Honduras need to break even.\n\nLow prices mean small farmers have less ability to protect their crops against rising climate threats such as more frequent and longer-lasting droughts and the spread and growing severity of devastating fungal pathogens, including coffee leaf rust and coffee wilt disease.\n\nThe double whammy of grinding poverty and climate change is reportedly driving Latin American coffee growers to leave home and emigrate northwards in search of employment. While small farms in poorer countries like Honduras go out of business, Kettler said the bigger operations in Brazil and Vietnam are becoming more dominant.\n\nIn some parts of the world, he said, \u201ccoffee is grown in mountainous regions where large-scale coffee farms can\u2019t be developed. These farmers can\u2019t compete or adapt as well\u201d to threats like climate change and disease.\n\nBig Agriculture tends to embrace the commercial benefits of monoculture: In the short term, it can be more efficient to grow a lot of a smaller range of plants. The global coffee trade currently relies on only two species: Arabica, which makes up around 60% of the coffee produced, and Robusta, which accounts for around 40%.", "description": "Climate change, disease and poverty threaten the global coffee industry.", "authors": ["Tom Levitt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XZFiU2gTp3ZAtOKwN7pA8w--~B/aD01MDAwO3c9MzgzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da5cf502100004c0facef2f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
