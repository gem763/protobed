If it goes ahead it could help Alphabet compete with Apple, which has the second largest share of the wrist technology market.\n\nFitbit\u2019s shares soared more than 23pc on Monday evening on the news report from Reuters, who cited people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe health technology company announced that it was looking for a buyer earlier this year, after four years of decline following a disastrous public listing in 2015. Fitbit\u2019s share price has dwindled from a high of $32 to just $4 a day before reports of Google's potential acquisition. An increasingly crowded wearable market, largely dominated by Apple, and lack of feature innovation has failed to inspire consumers to come back for new versions of its devices each year.\n\nDespite this, shipments of wrist-worn technology increased this year and the top five smartwatch companies: Xiaomi, Apple, Huawei, Fitbit and Samsung are closing in on traditional watchmakers, making up 65.7pc of the market. Apple recently launched its fifth iteration of its Watch, which retails between \u00a3399 and \u00a31,399. Wrist-worn technology is predicted to become increasingly popular, with 152.7m devices predicted to be sold by the end of the year, a 22pc increase from 2018, according to IDC.\n\nGoogle has its own wearable operating system, WearOS, which it licenses to watch companies like Fossil, but it does not offer its own smartwatch. It inked a $40m (\u00a331m) deal with Fossil to buy some of the American designer's smartwatch technology in January.\n\nGoogle, traditionally a software company, surprised the markets back in 2016 when it announced that after years of licensing its Android operating system it would launch its own branded phone, the Google Pixel, that would be priced similarly to the iPhone. Earlier this month it launched the Pixel 4.", "description": "Google's parent company Alphabet has reportedly made a bid for Fitbit, causing the troubled activity tracker company\u2019s shares to skyrocket.", "authors": ["Margi Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wlfnPKuNZkukSSYvIJv6oA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/1440febaae6abab72ae5cc8a3df95e23", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
