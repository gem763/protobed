We remain broadly on track to deliver within our full year production targets, with an increase in production guidance at Minas-Rio.\n\n\"We expect to deliver to our production guidance for copper and thermal coal, albeit at the lower end of their ranges; with copper working to mitigate the effect of drought conditions in central Chile.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, metallurgical coal production increased by 22% to 6.6 million tonnes due to improved wash plant throughput and equipment efficiency, as well as the timing of longwall moves.\n\nKumba's iron ore production was unchanged at 10.5 million tonnes, as increased production at Sishen was offset by lower production at Kolomela due to a plant upgrade, the company said. Minas-Rio's strong operational performance continued as iron ore production reached 6.1 million tonnes.\n\nCompiled by Khulekani Magubane", "description": "Anglo American reported that De Beers' diamond production decreased by 14% in the third quarter due to planned mine closures and weaker market demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9484/c03dd011d5854dc49d007667fb54784f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
