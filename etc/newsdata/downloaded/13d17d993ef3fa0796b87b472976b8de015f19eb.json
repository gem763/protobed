It is unusual to have that instruction be accompanied with the additional phrase \u201cThis is a very quiet play.\u201d\n\nAt the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, the usher who said this just before the lights went down was not kidding: Manhattan Theatre Club\u2019s production of The Height of the Storm (to Nov. 24), directed by Jonathan Kent, is truly very quiet.\n\nIndeed, the play, performed to rave reviews last autumn in London, is so quiet and delicately performed that the all-too-familiar kind of theater hell of paper rustlers, whisperers, key janglers, and general fidgeters at a recent Saturday performance sounded even more infernal than usual. The stage seemed far away, the actors somehow recessed on it, and all the usual audience rule-breakers all too loud and present.\n\nThe irony is that this is a hushed piece of drama that you really need to hear, because you will be discussing its weirdness and plot and characters for quite some time afterward. The Height of the Storm is written by Florian Zeller, translated by Christopher Hampton. Most recently in New York, we saw Zeller-translated-by-Hampton\u2019s The Mother, starring Isabelle Huppert, and in that\u2014just as here\u2014a blur of time and perspectives adds a general sense of bafflement to the drama on stage.\n\nIn front of us is a beautiful kitchen of what looks like an old house in the countryside, trees looming outside Anthony Ward\u2019s cool and elegant set (he also designed the costumes).\n\nFirst, we think that Andr\u00e9 (Jonathan Pryce) is alive, and his wife, Madeline (Eileen Atkins), is dead. Then it seems she is alive, and he is dead. This is revealed in conversations that wheel through time with their daughters, Anne (Amanda Drew) and Elise (Lisa O\u2019Hare), who are worried about what happens next, and what they should do with the family home. The daughters are locked in the dynamics of old sibling rivalry and conflict.\n\nAndr\u00e9, as played by Pryce, is a gruff and blustering man adrift in grief and illness, at physical and psychological war with himself. Atkins is wonderful: vinegary, dry, unforgiving, and occasionally judgmental\u2014and their final scene together in the dying light of the kitchen is beautifully tender.\n\nAtkins has a particular steadying pace when it comes to her lines and bearing, a pace that is then imposed on the audience watching her. This beguiling naturalism roots all her character\u2019s interactions and shades. Really, you\u2019d pay to watch Pryce and Atkins perform for 80 minutes just together.\n\nThis is their show, with the daughters as supporting characters. There is added confusion over the presence of a woman (Lucy Cohu), who may or may not have had an affair with Andr\u00e9, and a man (James Hillier), who is Elise\u2019s new boyfriend. Hugh Vanstone\u2019s beautiful lighting tells us who is speaking and when, whether you think we are simply in Andr\u00e9\u2019s mind, scrambled by increasing dementia, or if the play is doing strange things with time and perspective (or both).\n\n\u201c The story works on multiple levels, and as intriguing as it is to investigate the issues of aging, dependence, independence, and mortality, it is also its own frustrating mix of jigsaw puzzle and elegantly written and performed meditation. \u201d\n\nThe play revolves around puzzles. Did this couple marry at a particular hotel? Did they enjoy, then die by, mushrooms? Was there infidelity, other children? Are their daughters venal, or just concerned about their parents\u2019 failing health? Who knows what? When did they know it? Who lived? Who died? How did they live? How did they die? Are we watching the living remembering beloved ghosts, or ghosts remembering their lives?\n\nAt the performance this critic attended, the audience applauded Atkins when Madeline told Anne to \u201cfuck off,\u201d but Anne isn\u2019t particularly evil or grasping. The story works on multiple levels, and as piercing as it is in its investigation of aging, dependence, independence, and mortality, it is also its own frustrating mix of jigsaw puzzle and elegantly written and performed meditation.\n\nPryce and Atkins are marvelous, but they are also lost in the odd, physical failure of the staging\u2014rather than the thicket of Zeller\u2019s narrative mischiefs, which they fluently master.", "description": "Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins beautifully play a couple who may be dead, alive, or ghosts in \u2018The Height of the Storm.\u2019 But the play feels somewhat lost on its Broadway stage.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569362715/190924-teeman-height-of-the-storm-tease_xvt9kf", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
