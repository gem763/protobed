It\u2019s so easy to open the doors and let them in. ... They\u2019ve got pretty much all the creature comforts they need. We let them in and take care of them, just let them know that people care about them.\"\n\nOn Thursday, he would open his doors to about 120 people, rescued by Mack\u2019s furniture salesmen from the likes of stranded vehicles, strip-mall parking lots and sometimes while fleeing their own flooded homes. Once at Gallery Furniture, they were given warm clothing \u2015 a Gallery Furniture sweatshirt \u2014 and food and drinks from the store\u2019s in-house restaurant. They camped out on mattresses, on sofas, on couch beds, anything with a cushion, and could watch TV on any of Mack\u2019s big screens. If they needed a shower, the store had those too, usually just for employees after using the gym.\n\nFifteen to 20 people would stay the night, McIngvale said.\n\n\u201cWe got through Harvey,\u201d he told local news station KTRK earlier Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\n\nFor the past 38 years, that\u2019s the outlook that has turned McIngvale into one of the most beloved businessmen in Houston, known as much for his wacky fast-talking \u201csaves... you... MONEY!\u201d commercials as he is for his charity. He\u2019s always been a philanthropist, donating brand new furniture to dozens of needy families at Christmas and feeding thousands of homeless people on Thanksgiving. But in recent years, as flood after flood has devastated the city, the salesman\u2019s reputation for offering rapid-fire flood relief to some of the most desperate Houstonians has eclipsed his image as the guy wearing a mattress on television (although he still does that too, from time to time).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a practicing Catholic,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think I should practice what I preach.\u201d\n\nBut first, before the philanthropy, he had to do the commercials.\n\nMcIngvale moved to Houston from Dallas in 1981 with $5,000 in his pocket, all of which he invested in his new business. Until he could afford a store, he sold the furniture under a tent on the side of the freeway.\n\nBut things got better. His big break came in 1983. McIngvale, desperate for customers, bought a 25-second commercial. In his very last take, frustrated after hours of failure, he improvised. He whipped a few bucks out of his pocket and blurted out, \u201cGallery Furniture saves... you... MONEY!\u201d It stuck \u2014 for the next 36 years.\n\nBefore long he became Houston\u2019s \u201cMattress Mack,\" a nickname he picked up as anyone with a TV in Houston began to recognize him as the guy who wore mattresses in his ads. He was inspired, he told The Post, by a Texas tire salesman who wore tires in the 1950s to distinguish himself from competitors \u2014 and it worked for Mack, too. Promising to \u201csave you money\u201d dressed as an inanimate object, McIngvale saw sales soar. He started to dress up in other costumes too, such as a hunchbacked Father Time or a pink Easter Bunny.\n\nBy 2000, the Houston mattress advertisement market was wild, as competitors tried to outdo the famous Mattress Mack. That year, late-night host Conan O\u2019Brien took note while watching his own show on TV in Houston. Hilton Furniture ran a commercial trying to slash mattress prices with an actual chain saw, which came right after McIngvale advertised a recliner chair saying, \u201cLook, Ma! No hands!\u201d O\u2019Brien turned the ads into a competition.\n\nBut by then, McIngvale wasn\u2019t quite as concerned with catchy gimmicks. As his business grew, so did his philanthropy.\n\n\u201cPeople have been seeing these commercials for 38 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as retail continues to change, we have to try to stay relevant. And being part of the community I think is what helps us stay relevant.\u201d\n\nMcIngvale first opened his doors to flood victims in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina rocked the Gulf Coast. He said his faith drove him to do it, as he saw people with nothing pouring into Houston after losing everything in New Orleans. On the billboard outside his store, he wrote, \u201cLOUISIANA RESIDENTS SLEEP HERE FREE.\u201d Hundreds did.\n\nHe would offer hundreds of flood victims free mattresses in ensuing years if they lost theirs, such as after the Memorial Day floods in 2015. But Harvey was something else.\n\nTens of thousands of people were displaced in a matter of hours in August 2017, seeking emergency shelter as they were rescued by civilians in fishing boats and first responders in dump trucks. The city had used every resource at its disposal to combat the unprecedented flooding. McIngvale knew he had to do something.\n\nReading from a short speech he wrote in Sharpie, he got on Facebook Live and told nearly 4 million people to come on over to Gallery Furniture for a place to sleep, and bring your animals.\n\nHe gave them his personal cellphone number.\n\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s favorite saying is, if not for my struggle, I would not have known my strength,\" he said, referring to his daughter who overcame severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. \u201cFor a couple hundred years, Texans have banded together and helped each other, and we will get through this crisis of flooding and hurricane.\u201d\n\nHis employees, like countless other civilians and first responders that weekend, waded through water past their waists to reach trapped Houstonians and bring them to the furniture stores. For several nights, roughly 400 people poured into McIngvale\u2019s two stores. Donations of clothing and supplies poured in, and some of the refugees turned into volunteers, helping serve the meals from the in-house restaurant. \u201cThink a slumber party on steroids,\u201d he told NPR at the time.\n\nBefore a national audience, President Trump praised McIngvale in October 2017. \u201cIn Mack, we see the strength of the American spirit,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 200,000 people signed a petition asking that the city name a day after \u201cMattress Mack\u201d because of his generosity, calling him an \u201cicon,\u201d saying he \u201cdeserves to be remembered.\u201d\n\nAnd when he had a \u201cstroke scare\u201d in June, about 3,500 people texted him, sending messages of support to his personal cellphone.\n\nHe gave it out again Thursday as he welcomed dozens of dripping wet Houstonians to Gallery Furniture for the third time. Less than two minutes into his Facebook Live video, he picked up the phone.\n\nYes, he told the caller, \u201cwe are open as a shelter.\"", "description": "\u201cWe got through Harvey,\u201d Mattress Mack said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZW3BE66I5GLPFLYFQJUEB65A4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
