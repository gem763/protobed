When an insider of a company wants to buy or sell their company\u2019s stock, they need to inform the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. An insider is a person who has access to confidential information about a company. In other words, the important people in a company need to tell the public if they are buying or selling their company\u2019s stock.\n\nI always like to know what the insiders are doing when I consider making an investment. Even more so, I like to see if they are buying after the price has dropped dramatically. A lack of insider buying could suggest that the selloff was justified, while meaningful buying could be a significant bullish signal.\n\nThere are many reasons why an insider of a company may decide to sell. They may need money tuition or to buy a new house. But there is only one reason why an insider would buy their company\u2019s stock. They believe it is undervalued and eventually they will make money.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere has been significant buying by the insiders in the following micro-cap and small-cap stocks recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeanomics (IDEX)\n\nIdeanomics Inc. (NASDAQ:IDEX) is a fintech company with significant operations in the Chinese electric vehicle market. It is currently trading with a valuation of around $200 million.\n\nLike many companies with exposure to China, IDEX has seen the price of its stock decline over the past year. However, it does seem to be coming back. Despite the recent volatility it is up 27% year-to-date. This company seems to have a lot going for it. Many analysts expect the Chinese EV market to expand rapidly over the next few year which would benefit IDEX.\n\nAdditionally, in the most recent quarter the company reported earnings of 5 cents a share. This is a significant improvement over last year\u2019s loss of 12 cents in the same quarter. This could be a signal that Alfred Poor, who became the CEO a year ago, has begun to turn things around.\n\nBruno Zheng Wu is the chairman of the company. He recently acquired a block of stock in a private transaction. The seller was having liquidity concerns due to issues with other investments, so Wu agreed to pay $3 a share for 1.7 million shares. This was a personal investment of over $5 million and could be a significant bullish signal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBriggs & Stratton (BGG)\n\nBriggs & Stratton (NYSE:BGG) designs, manufactures and sells gasoline engines and outdoor power equipment. After its recent price drop, the company has a market cap of $187 million. Most analysts would consider this to be a micro-cap stock.\n\nBGG stock dropped by almost 50% when it reported earnings which were way short of estimates. The company lost 45 cents a share while estimates called for a 45 cent profit. It traded at a multi-decade low but has since recovered a little.\n\nSome of the insiders must think that this selloff was an overreaction and that the stock is a good value at these levels. There has been significant insider buying.\n\nFrank Jaehnert is a director of BGG. He just bought 40,000 shares at $4.39. This was a $175,600 investment. Vice President of Product Innovation Mike Zeiler just paid $4.25 for 43,000 shares. This was an investment of $180,000. Other insiders have recently purchased the stock as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nEsperion Therapeutics (ESPR)", "description": "Insider buying could be a bullish signal for a stock.
