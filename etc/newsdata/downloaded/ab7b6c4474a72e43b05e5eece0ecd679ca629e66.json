SCHW, +1.10% began offering clients free trading on equities, exchange-traded funds and options beginning Oct. 7. The move led to competitors TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. AMTD, +0.92% and E-Trade Financial Corp. ETFC, +0.08% following suit. Smaller rival Interactive Brokers Corp. had announced its commission-free trading product a week before, while the privately-held start-up Robinhood Markets Inc. has made a name for itself offering no-free trades since 2014.\n\nIn another bid to compete with Robinhood and other online upstarts, Schwab told the Wall Street Journal that his firm would soon allow clients to trade in fractional shares of stocks to help investors who don\u2019t have the capital to buy whole shares.\n\nSchwab has reason to be optimistic. While the announcement has led all four of these publicly traded brokerage stocks to retreat on fees, Schwab\u2019s has performed the best. Since Oct. 1, TD Amertitrade shares have fallen 22.2%, E-Trade shares have lost 10.6% and Interactive Brokers Group Inc.\u2019s stock has lost 14.9%. Charles Schwab shares, meanwhile, have lost just 5.7%, as of Thursday\u2019s close.\n\nThe outperformance of Schwab shares reflects its more diversified revenue base. The firm collects just 8% of its revenue from trading fees, while more than half comes from earning returns by investing idle cash left in customer accounts. It also derives revenue from asset management fees and back-office services for institutional investors.\n\nAnother source of revenue for Schwab and its rival brokers are payments for order flow. Market makers including Citadel Securities LLC and Virtu Financial Inc. VIRT, +1.75% pay brokerages to route orders to them so that they can capture spreads on each trade. The practice is controversial because some argue that it encourages brokers to send order to the highest bidder rather than the market maker offering the best price. Canada has banned the practice, while regulators in the United Kingdom have put the practice under review.\n\nIn a conversation after his book promostion, Schwab told MarketWatch that the issue is an important one, and that he supported recent efforts by the SEC to force brokerages to disclose more about the practice, while arguing that his firm never lets these payments get in the way of finding the best price.\n\n\u201cRobinhood, they don\u2019t participate, that I know of, in price improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a firm like us, we demand price improvement from the market maker and we pass that along to our clients.\u201d\n\nAnother concern some observers have with the brokerage price wars is that trading has become too cheap and easy, encouraging investors to make unwise trades. David Bize, an Oklahoma City-based financial planner told MarketWatch that do-it-yourself investors have had low-cost trades for years, which provided ample rope to hang themselves.\u201d No costs would encourage even more trades, which, he said, \u201cmost people do poorly, rather than a \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 approach, which would be better for them.\u201d\n\nSchwab disagreed. \u201cWith commissions out of the formula, investing is more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cCommissions get in the way of investment performance and asset allocation and they are an unneeded encumbrance for the investor.\u201d", "description": "Schwab founder looks back on forty years of selling stocks for a discount", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT550_charle_ZG_20191017160248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
