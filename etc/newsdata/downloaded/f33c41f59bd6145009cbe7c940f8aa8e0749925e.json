Photograph: Uganda Broadcasting Corporation\n\nMost of the 70,000 pictures were taken by a team of photographers from the information ministry who followed the Ugandan dictator over the course of his eight-year rule. Many show Amin at public occasions, but some are of private episodes, such as the arrest and humiliation of alleged petty criminals shortly before their execution.\n\nOthers are more intimate, showing the dictator with his family or close associates, and were taken by officials and associates. Amin is seen with his children surrounded by Christmas decorations, playing the accordion and swimming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Idi Amin at Lake Albert in July 1973.

They also cast new light on the reality of life for ordinary Ugandans under the rule of a man held responsible for between 100,000 and 500,000 deaths.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amin and his family with the South Vietnamese President in Uganda, 1973.

He started well but turned into something else. We need to learn about what we must fight against to stop these things ever happening again,\u201d Nkaale said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amin gives citizenship to British officials in 1975. Photograph: Uganda Broadcasting Corporation\n\nDuring Amin\u2019s rule, security services and the military targeted different ethnic communities seen as potentially disloyal, as well as real and imagined opponents. Journalists, judges, businesspeople, artists, officials and clerics were abducted, tortured and killed. Victims included Uganda\u2019s Anglican archbishop and one of Amin\u2019s own wives.\n\nDr Richard Vokes, an anthropologist at the University of Western Australia, who was involved in the discovery, said the photographs depicted a \u201ckind of magic energy\u201d that was both \u201cbehind the brutality and part of the brutality\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe see how [Amin] embraced the media and understood its power ... How he had a great sense of how media could amplify his ego and his political will,\u201d Vokes said.\n\nThe display of a selection of the pictures at Uganda\u2019s national museum in a pioneering exhibition has been welcomed by many of Amin\u2019s relatives, as well as the families of some of his victims.\n\nSarah Bananuka, whose father and three brothers were murdered during Amin\u2019s rule, said the exhibition was a good initiative but expressed concern that the official photographs might hide the grim reality of the regime.\n\n\u201cIn these pictures you see him in parties, enjoying life and meeting people. We didn\u2019t see the other side of Amin, which we felt, lived and experienced,\u201d the 69-year-old said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Miss Tourism girls visit Amin at State House in 1978. Photograph: Uganda Broadcasting Corporation\n\nHajji Edrisa Mayanja Njuki, the head of the presidential press unit during the 1970s, said the exhibition depicted the \u201creal Amin\u201d. \u201cThe pictures that show his good side had never been produced and published. It has always been the negative side of the story,\u201d Njuki said.\n\nUnlike in South Africa after the fall of the apartheid regime, or in Rwanda after the genocide of 1994, there has been no official attempt in Uganda to address the violence that followed Amin\u2019s seizure of power in 1971.\n\n\u201c[Uganda] has never had a process of mourning, even of reflection. There are no public memorials, victims\u2019 groups \u2026 all the things you see elsewhere in places with traumatic periods in their past. So this is the first public memorial,\u201d Vokes said.\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s organisers had to wrestle with the fact that few of the photographs depict the violence of life in Uganda in the 1970s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amin addresses troops during a visit to border regions.

One was executed after taking pictures of the aftermath of a hijacking by Palestinian and German terrorists that led to a raid by Israeli special forces on Entebbe airport in 1976.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amin makes a speech at Nile Mansion in 1978.

There are photos of representatives from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation meeting the dictator, and pictures of a deputation of black activists from the US.\n\nBritish and other officials expected Amin to choose the west in the cold war battle for influence under way across Africa at the time. Instead, he took Uganda into the \u201crevolutionary international\u201d group of what were then known as \u201cprogressive\u201d states, receiving wide-ranging support from Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi and arms from the Soviet Union. East Germany assisted Amin\u2019s security services.\n\nAmin was ousted after launching an invasion of Tanzania in 1979 and died in exile in Saudi Arabia in 2003.\n\nBananuka said the exhibition was \u201ca beginning\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s making people come out to think how we can do it better. We need to get more people who are willing to talk about their experiences and share it out. Maybe somebody may learn a lesson or two,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amin celebrates his 51st birthday in 1979.

That fracture will be permanent if we don\u2019t discuss our past and go through healing. The country needs a lot of healing,\u201d the 53-year-old said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Samuel Okiror in Kampala", "description": "Photos taken by official photographers show how Ugandan dictator exploited media \u2018to amplify ego and political will\u2019", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90ed2db5c0c9bb449e91f29820b90c879d999fd/913_0_4047_2429/master/4047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bdc49d5c20417c984badc0bee831a92", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
