Some estimates suggest half of all travelers may have driver\u2019s licenses that don\u2019t comply with requirements called REAL ID. You can quickly tell if you comply by looking for a star in the upper-right corner of your driver\u2019s license.\n\nA sample driver\u2019s license with a REAL ID star in the upper right-hand corner. Different states have different designs for the star, but if you want to use your license as an ID at an airport after Oct. 1, 2020, you need a star in most cases.

Worse, you may not be able to fly. Secondary screening usually involves an interview and efforts to verify identity, and most checkpoints have limited capacity to do that. If there are too many people without IDs, ticketed passengers will be turned away.\n\nThe REAL ID Act of 2005 requires minimum standards for verifying identity when states issue driver\u2019s licenses, plus additional security enhancements. The law came out of recommendations from the 9/11 Commission Report that the government needs to know with certainty who\u2019s who when boarding airplanes or entering secure federal buildings.\n\nAirlines and the TSA are starting to scan faces to get people through security and the boarding gate faster. WSJ's Scott McCartney tests out the airline's facial recognition technology and learns not all passengers are ready to give up their privacy.\n\nTypically that means proving who you are, where you live and what your Social Security number is when you get or renew a driver\u2019s license. Most state DMVs have checklists of what you need to bring to satisfy the requirements.\n\nIt has taken more than a decade for many states to comply with the federal requirements. The Department of Homeland Security has continued to issue waivers because so many people don\u2019t have REAL ID licenses.\n\nMillions of travelers may find their driver\u2019s licenses aren\u2019t valid at airport checkpoints next year. The rules change may create chaos if passengers don\u2019t comply ahead of time, so TSA is posting new warning signs. Photo: Ericka Burchett/The Wall Street Journal\n\nFlorida began issuing the new licenses in 2010 but New York didn\u2019t start until 2017. California, which has 27 million licensed drivers, didn\u2019t start issuing until January 2018. In California, you must make a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles if you want REAL ID.\n\nMaine and New Jersey just started issuing the new licenses this summer. Oklahoma and Oregon won\u2019t get there until mid-2020. Residents in those two states could have a mad scramble of a few months to renew licenses if they count on that as their travel ID.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nEven with millions and millions of travelers lacking REAL ID, TSA says it is serious about pressing ahead, rolling out more messages you\u2019ll start seeing soon at checkpoints across the country. New signs warn travelers of the impending deadline. Last month, TSA officers at some airports started telling travelers personally if their ID doesn\u2019t comply. The big nationwide push starts Oct. 1, one year from the deadline.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see a lot more in the future from us,\u201d says TSA press secretary Jenny Burke.\n\nExtra-long lines at DMVs across the country are a real concern. The Texas Department of Public Safety is already under fire for three- and four-hour waits for driver\u2019s licenses at Dallas-area offices after closing small offices and consolidating locations, with lines stretching around buildings in sweltering summer heat.\n\n\u201cThe way DPS has handled driver\u2019s licenses in the state of Texas is despicable, and it has been nonresponsive,\u201d Gov. Greg Abbott said in March about his own state agency.\n\nThe Texas DPS says that by the October 2020 deadline it expects at least 76% of Texas cardholders\u2014driver\u2019s license and ID cards\u2014will be REAL ID-compliant. In Texas, the REAL ID requirements don\u2019t determine whether you can renew online. You are required to renew in person every other time, a DPS spokesman says.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you believe the government will stand by its REAL ID deadline? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn California, the Department of Motor Vehicles says it is hiring 2,000 additional front-line workers in its 172 field offices and keeping some offices open longer, including Saturdays, to handle the expected rush. So far, about 5.5 million of the 16.5 million driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards issued since January 2018 have been compliant, spokesman Jaime Garza says.\n\nMany drivers don\u2019t fly or are happy to use passports for ID rather than make a trip to the DMV. They can renew online or at kiosks in grocery stores or libraries if they don\u2019t want the REAL ID star.\n\nBut many simply don\u2019t understand the requirement. The California DMV has been putting up signs and videos in airports, and just hired a marketing firm to spread the message more in local communities. \u201cWe\u2019re really making a huge push,\u201d Mr. Garza says. \u201cWhat people have been confused about is they don\u2019t know what REAL ID is.\u201d\n\nWhat also isn\u2019t clear is whether the Department of Homeland Security\u2014TSA\u2019s boss\u2014will stick to the 2020 deadline.\n\nDHS, which has been shifting TSA and Customs and Border Protection officers from airports to the southern border, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA waiver pushing back the deadline to avoid airport chaos just one month before the presidential election might seem likely. But deadlines have come and gone before without TSA sounding the alarm. This time is different, the first time TSA is mounting a major campaign toward compliance.\n\n\u201cWe are moving forward as if implementation will occur,\u201d TSA\u2019s Ms. Burke says.\n\nIt\u2019s probably time to get yourself to the DMV.\n\nWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com", "description": "After nearly 15 years, the deadline to get a REAL ID driver\u2019s license is finally approaching.
