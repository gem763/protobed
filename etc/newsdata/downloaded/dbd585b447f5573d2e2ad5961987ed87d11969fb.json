They are a \u201cgenre in progress\u201d, declares Ozturkmen, with unique narratives, use of space and musical scores. And they are very, very popular.\n\nThanks to international sales and global viewership, Turkey is second only to the US in worldwide TV distribution \u2013 finding huge audiences in Russia, China, Korea and Latin America. At present, Chile is the largest consumer of dizi in terms of number of shows sold, while Mexico, then Argentina, pay the most to buy them.\n\nDizi are sweeping epics, with each episode usually running to two hours or longer. Advertising time is cheap in Turkey and the state broadcasting watchdog mandates that every 20 minutes of content be broken up by seven minutes of commercials. Every dizi has its own original soundtrack, and can have up to 50 major characters. They tend to be filmed on location in the heart of historic Istanbul, using studios only when they must.\n\nDizi storylines, which have covered everything from gang rape to scheming Ottoman queens, are \u201cDickens and the Bront\u00eb sisters\u201d, I am told by Eset, a young Istanbul screenwriter and film-maker. \u201cWe tell at least two versions of the Cinderella story per year on Turkish TV. Sometimes Cinderella is a 35-year-old single woman with a child; sometimes she\u2019s a 22-year-old starving actress.\u201d Eset, who worked on perhaps the most famous dizi, Magnificent Century, recounts the narrative themes that dizi are usually loyal to:\n\nYou can\u2019t put a gun in your hero\u2019s hand.\n\nThe centre of any drama is the family.\n\nAn outsider will always journey into a socio-economic setting that is the polar opposite of their own, eg moving from a village to the city.\n\nThe heart-throb has had his heart broken and is tragically closed to love.\n\nNothing beats a love triangle.\n\nDizi are built, Eset insists, on the altar of \u201ccommunal yearning\u201d, both for the audience and the characters. \u201cWe want to see the good guy with the good girl, but, dammit, life is bad and there are bad characters around.\u201d\n\nAccording to Izzet Pinto, the founder of the Istanbul-based Global Agency, which bills itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s leading independent TV content distributor for global markets\u201d, the upward course of dizi imperialism began with 2006\u2019s Binbir Gece (1001 Nights). At the time, another Turkish show, G\u00fcm\u00fcs (Silver), was already a hit in the Middle East, but it was 1001 Nights that became a truly global success. Wherever 1001 Nights was sold \u2013 in almost 80 countries \u2013 it was a ratings smash.\n\nThe show featured a blue-eyed Turkish dreamboat, Halit Ergen\u00e7, who would go on to star in the lead role of Magnificent Century. Based on the life of Suleiman the Magnificent, the 10th Ottoman Sultan, Magnificent Century told the story of the sultan\u2019s love affair with a concubine named Hurrem, whom he married, in a major break with tradition. A largely unknown historical figure, Hurrem is believed to have been an Orthodox Christian from modern-day Ukraine.\n\nWhen it first aired in Turkey in 2011, Magnificent Century claimed one-third of the country\u2019s TV audience. The foreign press called it an \u201cOttoman-era Sex and the City\u201d and compared it to a real-life Game of Thrones. It had multiple historical consultants and a production team of 130, with 25 people working on costumes alone.\n\nMagnificent Century was so popular in the Middle East that Arab tourism to Istanbul skyrocketed. Turkey\u2019s minister of culture and tourism even stopped charging certain Arab countries broadcasting fees. Global Agency estimates that, even without counting its most recent buyers in Latin America, Magnificent Century has been seen by more than 500 million people worldwide. It was the first dizi bought by Japan. Since 2002, about 150 Turkish dizi have been sold to more than 100 countries, including Algeria, Morocco and Bulgaria. It was Magnificent Century that blazed the way for others to follow.\n\nThe international success of such dizi is just one sign of the way new forms of mass culture from the east \u2013 from Bollywood to K-pop \u2013 are challenging the dominance of American pop culture in the 21st century. Ergen\u00e7 feels that the runaway success of the dizi is partly due to the fact that American TV is entertaining, but not moving. \u201cThey don\u2019t touch the feelings that make us human,\u201d he tells me, nursing a cold cup of coffee, when we meet in Istanbul. Turkey\u2019s gaze was once keenly turned to the west, studying its films and television for clues about how to behave in a modern, fast-paced world, but today, American shows offer little guidance.\n\n\u201cI was thinking of one American TV series \u2013 let\u2019s not say its name. The philosophy of the series was being lonely. Being, um \u2026 \u201d \u2013 he searches for the polite word \u2013 \u201cmulti-partner at the same time, and searching for happiness. And all the people who were watching those series were very excited about it.\u201d I can only guess he is referring to Sex and the City, but Ergen\u00e7 doesn\u2019t say. \u201cThat\u2019s a tiring thing, isn\u2019t it? Being alone, changing partners quickly and searching for happiness, and each time you search for it, it\u2019s a failure. But it was in a very fancy world, so people were very interested. They\u2019re spending and spending \u2013 spending their time, spending their love, spending everything.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Magnificent Century, based on the life of Suleiman the Magnificent, the 10th Ottoman Sultan. Photograph: Tims Productions\n\nThe dizi that became global behemoths were powered by narratives that pitted traditional values and principles against the emotional and spiritual corruption of the modern world. Fatmag\u00fcl\u2019\u00fcn Su\u00e7u Ne? (What Is Fatmag\u00fcl\u2019s Fault?) centered on the gang rape of a young girl named Fatmag\u00fcl and her battle for justice. It was a huge hit in Argentina, and in Spain its primetime slot drew close to a million viewers per episode. Fatmag\u00fcl is soon to get a full Spanish telenovela remake, adapted to a daily, half-hour afternoon format.\n\nThe show addresses a woman\u2019s place in society, while subjecting her to myriad problems, from forced marriage to tense family relations to the suffocating power of the rich. But Fatmag\u00fcl perseveres. She educates herself and defeats every hardship as she fights for, and receives, justice on all fronts: civil justice through the nation\u2019s courts, divine justice through the punishment of her violators \u2013 and, of course, the justice of true love.\n\nAlthough dizi have dealt with abuse, rape and honour killings, by and large, Turkish men are portrayed as more romantic than Romeo. \u201cThey show people what they want to see,\u201d Pinar Celikel, an Istanbul fashion editor tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201d Yet Eset argued that Fatmag\u00fcl was groundbreaking in its approach to women\u2019s issues. Previously, agents of change and the heroes of dizi stories were always men, but \u201cFatmag\u00fcl didn\u2019t accept women\u2019s place as being subjugated, almost invisible\u201d.\n\nIt was such a persuasive vehicle for soft power that in 2012, Eset was hired by a \u201cRepublican American thinktank\u201d to write a dizi telling the \u201cgood American story\u201d of a woman in the Middle East out to enact positive change, \u201ca woman who softens America\u2019s image\u201d. Eset declines to say which thinktank commissioned him, except to hint that a former Bush administration undersecretary was involved with the institute. \u201cI wrote it,\u201d Eset shrugs as he rolls a cigarette. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t able to sell it.\u201d\n\nI am standing in the drizzle in a bleak parking lot on the Asian side of Istanbul in front of a white van. A man named Ferhat hands me a Glock 19 pistol. It is the same model Turkish soldiers use, he says, as he swings open the van doors. Inside, there is a rocket-launcher lying on the floor and about 60 other weapons hanging on racks. Ferhat, who is ex-military, pulls out a \u201cbad guy rifle\u201d \u2013 an AK-47 \u2013 and a sniper rifle. Men in military uniform prowl across the parking lot. All around us there are street signs in Arabic and extras in cheap suits.\n\nWe are on the set of S\u00f6z (The Oath), a new show made by Tims Productions, the company behind Magnificent Century. They are filming episode 38. A demolition expert saunters by, chatting to a man in a balaclava while an actor rehearses a scene, holding a rifle in each hand. S\u00f6z is a military dizi \u2013 a new sub-genre that is sweeping the nation. Although it is too early to have a sense of its global effect, S\u00f6z has already received remake offers from faraway markets including Mexico. Tims has always had an international outlook, I am told. They tried to cast Hollywood stars for Magnificent Century, and were reportedly close to signing Demi Moore to play a European princess until her divorce from Ashton Kutcher got in the way.\n\nOf the five major channels in Turkey, each has one of these \u201csoldier-glorifying\u201d shows, Eset the screenwriter tells me later, and all the shows are \u201czeitgeist-relevant\u201d. The baddies are either \u201cinternal enemies\u201d or foreign villains. S\u00f6z takes place in a Turkey beset by violence and existential threats. Soldiers are everywhere, blazing through the wreckage of suicide bombings at shopping malls and hunting terrorists who are hard at work kidnapping pregnant women. In the first episode, after an attack on a mall, a soldier promises they will not rest until \u201cwe drain this swamp\u201d \u2013 an eerily familiar refrain.\n\nAfter more than 100 hours of watching dizi, S\u00f6z was the first one in which I saw a woman wearing a hijab. The father of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal, later renamed Atat\u00fcrk, famously declared that he wished \u201call religions [were] at the bottom of the sea\u201d. He removed Islam as the state religion from the constitution and banned the fez, which he described as emblematic of \u201chatred of progress and civilization\u201d. The veil \u2013 which Atat\u00fcrk lambasted as a \u201cspectacle that makes the nation an object of ridicule\u201d \u2013 did not fare much better. By the 1980s, women in all public institutions, including universities, were banned from covering their heads.\n\nFive minutes on the streets of Istanbul presents multiple encounters with women in headscarves, yet they are nowhere to be seen on screen. \u201cThey tried it,\u201d Eset says, \u201cbut even the conservative folks don\u2019t like to see conservative women on TV. You can\u2019t get them to kiss, to stand up to their fathers, to run away, to do very much at all that would be considered drama.\u201d Women in hijabs are almost never shown in television adverts, the journalist and novelist Ece Temelkuran tells me. Her diagnosis was clear: \u201cThis country is torn between these two pieces of cloth \u2013 flag and headscarf.\u201d\n\nBack on the S\u00f6z set, as we move upstairs to a cold office building to watch a man pick up a phone for an hour while the demolition guys shoot glass windows in the corridor, I tell Selin Arat \u2013 director of international operations at Tims, and my guide for the day \u2013 that I watched an episode of S\u00f6z the previous night. Every time I looked down at my notebook, I explain, by the time I looked up again, everyone in the scene seemed to have been murdered. Who are the terrorists supposed to be? Arat, a delicate, strawberry-blond woman in a business suit, laughs. \u201cIt would be life-threatening if we knew who they were,\u201d she jokes.\n\nWhoever the terrorists are, S\u00f6z is a hit. \u201cIt\u2019s the first Turkish show that has surpassed one million subscribers on YouTube,\u201d Arat notes proudly. Selling S\u00f6z outside Turkey may prove tougher, though. \u201cWe do want this show to be global,\u201d says Timur Savc\u0131, the founder of Tims Productions. \u201cBut right now not many countries are really interested in watching Turkish soldiers be glorified.\u201d He pauses and smiles. \u201cThe US always makes shows and, at the end, they say: \u2018God bless America.\u2019 Well, God bless Turkey!\u201d\n\nSavc\u0131 sits at his desk in the Levent district of Istanbul, as five TVs, all tuned to different channels, illuminate his spacious office. He sets the tone for the dizi industry at large and, today, he is preparing an English adaptation of Magnificent Century. He is not the least bit interested in taking American shows and remaking them in Turkish. \u201cWe are just making originals. It\u2019s better!\u201d he says with a big laugh.\n\nDizi have yet to penetrate the English-speaking world. That could be because audiences in the US and UK don\u2019t like to watch subtitled shows, Savc\u0131 muses, \u201cor it could be the fact that this is about an Islamic state at the end of the day.\u201d I ask if that is something Tims would tone down in the English version of Magnificent Century? Savc\u0131, a jaunty, jovial man, shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that, at the time, the Ottoman Empire was the superpower of the world. What the US is now to the world is what the Ottoman was. If people look at it from this perspective, they would understand it more, but if they don\u2019t know this, they would feel threatened.\u201d\n\nTurks have been watching quality US TV since the 1970s. Turkish actors, such as Mert F\u0131rat, told me they learned all their chops from the likes of Dallas and Dynasty. That was where they learned to emote, and to perform the melodrama that dizi require. But there was something lacking, something fundamental missing from those early guides to how to be rich and powerful in the modern world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A still from S\u00f6z (The Oath)\n\nKivan\u00e7 Tatl\u0131tu\u011f, the star of the hit dizi G\u00fcm\u00fcs, among others, doesn\u2019t feel it is necessarily a question of values or conservatism, but empathy. Over email, he told me why he thinks audiences around the world are turning to dizi over western productions. \u201cMost of these audiences feel that their everyday stories are \u2018underexplored\u2019 by Hollywood and Europe,\u201d Tatl\u0131tu\u011f wrote. \u201cThis is ultimately a matter of diversity in storytelling. I understand the appeal of a story like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, these are both amazing TV shows. However, some people may also feel disenfranchised from these Hollywood themes, and may want to watch a story they can empathise with.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisappearing family values are not concerns for the west,\u201d Eset says. \u201cFor the past four years or so, 40% of the most-watched Turkish shows have been remakes of Korean dramas,\u201d he says, pointing out that the Koreans have been swifter than the Turks at penetrating the Latin American market. \u201cKorea is also a country that gives great importance to family, but in the west, the romantic notion of those good old family values is gone.\u201d\n\nAt the time of our meeting, Eset is working with a Turkish-American production house, Karga 7, which has global ambitions for their shows.\u201cWhen I talk to people about Turkish TV series,\u201d he tells me, \u201cmainly they are taken by this romantic notion of family where everyone is trying to cherish one another. The dangers are external, and socio-economic class plays a great role in the love story of the poor boy loving a rich girl, or vice versa. Normally a story like this in the west would be treated through an individual\u2019s journey, where there is more sex, there is more violence, there are drugs.\u201d Turkish TV has less of that. He points out that the couple in Fatmag\u00fcl don\u2019t kiss until about episode 58.\n\nIn August 2017 in Beirut, I speak to Fadi Ismail, the general manager of the Middle East Broadcasting Center\u2019s subsidiary O3 Productions, and the person responsible for bringing Turkish television to the Middle East. \u201cTo brag a bit,\u201d Ismail corrects me with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m the one who opened Turkish culture through TV to the whole world.\u201d MBC is the biggest broadcaster in the Middle East and North Africa, home to almost 400 million people. MBC has a news channel, a children\u2019s channel, a women\u2019s channel, a Bollywood channel and a 24-hour drama channel on which it broadcasts Egyptian soaps, Korean dramas and Latin American telenovelas.\n\nIn 2007, Ismail went to a buyer\u2019s cinema festival in Turkey and chanced upon a tiny kiosk showing a local television series. \u201cI stopped and watched it, not understanding anything,\u201d he remembers. \u201cBut immediately I could visualise it as Arabic content. I replaced it in my mind with Arabic audio and everything else looked culturally, socially \u2013 even the food, the clothes, everything for me looked like us, and I thought: \u2018Eureka!\u2019\u201d\n\nIsmail bought a Turkish series for his channel. He doesn\u2019t remember the name of that first show, because they had already hit on the formula of giving everything \u2013 the title, the characters \u2013 new Arabic names. \u201cEvery one of these titles had \u2018love\u2019 in it, so I stopped differentiating. Love Something, Blue Love, Long Love, Short Love, Killing Love.\u201d G\u00fcm\u00fcs \u2013 renamed Noor for the Middle East market \u2013 was the first big hit.\n\nAlthough the Egyptians had traditionally been known for their cinema, they also dominated TV across the region until Syria took over in the 1990s. Syrian actors were renowned for their dramatic and comedic skills. Their directors were artists. Talented scriptwriters produced shows of quality with substantial state help. The government poured money into the television industry, providing auteurs with cameras, equipment, state subsidies and permission to film in Syria\u2019s historic sites. But then the war broke out and the country\u2019s bright promise flickered. It was at this moment, Ismail says, that the Turks were ready to move in.\n\nGet the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n\nAs Syrian dramas had already become a \u201cpan-Arab phenomenon\u201d, MBC decided to dub all the Turkish dramas they bought into the Syrian Arabic dialect. \u201cThat is one of the reasons for their huge success,\u201d Ismail concludes. \u201cWe dubbed the Turkish dramas with the most prevalent and established drama accent: Syrian.\u201d Before Turkish dramas flooded Middle Eastern screens, people in Lebanon watched Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas. Though they were popular, they eventually ran out of steam for two reasons. The first was language. Telenovelas were dubbed into fusha, a standardised literary Arabic that is understood from Iraq to Sudan, and is used in newspapers, magazines and newscasts. Free from local accents and slang particular to each country, it is a formal, classical Arabic.\n\nThe second was a question of values. \u201cThe Mexicans really did not resemble us at all,\u201d says Imane Mezher, the format distribution and licensing coordinator of iMagic, a Beirut-based TV production company. iMagic makes Arabs Got Talent and the Middle East version of the X Factor, and experiments with new formats such as World Bellydance Championship, and an Islamically approved Extreme Makeover in which contestants don\u2019t alter God\u2019s design out of vanity, but have reconstructive surgery due to life-threatening issues.\n\nMezher shakes her head at the memory of the telenovelas. \u201cYou have a daughter and you don\u2019t know who her father is, you don\u2019t know who the mother is. The stories were moral-free. At the end of the day, like it or not, we like things to be a little more conservative. The Turks are amazing at that. They are the real mix: the European freedom that everyone longs for and, at the same time, the problems are conservative, the same we face. The people have the same names as us, the same stories as us, and people love that.\u201d\n\nYet over the past 18 months, the international reach of Turkish TV has been significantly curtailed. At 1am, Saudi Arabian time on 2 March 2018, MBC took dizi off the air. Six dizi were pulled, at a cost to MBC of $25m. \u201cThere is a decision to remove all Turkish drama from several TV outlets in the region,\u201d the channel\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm who took the decision.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had been in negotiations to buy MBC, but found the $3bn asking price too high. In November 2017, MBS, as he is known, arrested most of MBC\u2019s board and shareholders as part of what was billed as an anti-corruption sweep. After an 83-day stay in a luxury jail, MBC\u2019s founder Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman whose sister was married to a former king, was released. His company now had a secret new majority owner, whose first order of business was to cancel all of MBC\u2019s dizi programming.\n\nBefore then, the Middle East and North Africa region accounted for the largest international consumption of dizi. Magnificent Century was advertised alongside Game of Thrones and Oprah in Dubai, while Ece Y\u00f6ren\u00e7 \u2013 Fatmag\u00fcl\u2019s scriptwriter \u2013 was asked by Saudi Arabia to write TV series for its local channels, and rumours circulated of princes and politicians inquiring after show plotlines during state visits to Turkey. It is possible that this kind of Turkish soft power irked MBS. And it is certain that he was infuriated by Turkey\u2019s brazen flouting of his 2017 blockade of Qatar. Thus, in March 2018, MBS accused Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, of trying to build a new \u201cOttoman caliphate\u201d, included Turkey in what he bizarrely called a \u201ctriangle of evil\u201d, and swiftly erased dizi from Middle Eastern TV.\n\nIt is impossible to separate politics, both internal and geopolitical, from dizi\u2019s upward momentum. Erdo\u011fan himself was famously antagonistic to Magnificent Century, finding it too risque and not sufficiently versed in true Ottoman history. His government withdrew permission for its producers to film in historical sites such as Topkap\u0131 Palace, and Turkish Airlines pulled it from its in-flight entertainment systems in order to avoid government ire. A deputy from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP party even went so far as to submit a parliamentary petition to legally ban the show.\n\nAlthough Magnificent Century has never been used by the state to project Turkish soft power to the world, other dizi have. Two more recent productions for TRT, Turkish state television, have the government\u2019s wholehearted endorsement, if not their guidance. The first, Dirili\u015f: Ertu\u011frul, or Resurrection: Ertu\u011frul, begins at the start of Ottoman glory, with Ertu\u011frul Ghazi, the father of Sultan Osman, the founder of the empire. The dizi\u2019s tagline is \u201cA nation\u2019s awakening\u201d, and for five seasons viewers have watched Ertu\u011frul battle crusaders, Mongols, Christian Byzantines and more. It has the honour of being the most popular show to air on state TV. \u201cUntil the lions start writing their own stories,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said of Ertu\u011frul, \u201ctheir hunters will always be the heroes.\u201d\n\nAnother show, Payitaht Abd\u00fclhamid or The Last Emperor, bookends the Ottoman obsession: it is based on the last powerful Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II. It first aired in 2017, drawing in big numbers \u2013 every Friday, one in 10 television watchers tuned in as the sultan staved off rebellions by the Young Turks (who would eventually unseat him) and scheming European powers. Both supporters and detractors of the dizi pointed out that its portrayal of the sultan was modelled incredibly closely on Erdo\u011fan. Followers of the Turkish president saw symbiosis between the two proud leaders who were unafraid to confront the west, and who dreamed of making Turkey central to pan-Muslim unity. Critics pointed out the two men\u2019s paranoid reliance on intelligence services and an oppressive grip on power.\n\nBy 2023, the Turkish government hopes dizi will pull in $1bn from exports. In his Istanbul glass office, \u0130zzet Pinto, the founder of dizi distributor Global Agency, told me that $500m is a more realistic target given the loss of the Middle East market. But he foresees that remake rights, expansion in Latin America and the opening of western Europe \u2013 notably Italy and Spain \u2013 will help offset those losses.\n\nOver at Tims, Selin Arat predicts that Turkish series have reached a stable level of popularity. Demand might not grow much more, but there is a global hunger for what Turkish TV can offer. Arat concedes that the Saudi stance against dizi is a setback, but, he says: \u201cIt won\u2019t be the end of the Turkish dizi invasion.\u201d\n\nAdapted from New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K-Pop by Fatima Bhutto, published on 10 October by Columbia Global Reports, and available at guardianbookshop.co.uk\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "description": "The long read: Shows such as Magnificent Century have come to rival US TV for international popularity, sweeping through the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.
