The Fake News denies it! pic.twitter.com/elJ7ROfm2p \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nI was with you all the way Alabama. The Fake News Media was not! https://t.co/gO5pwahaj9 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nPeople on Twitter couldn\u2019t seem to believe their eyes when the president brought it up yet again Thursday, with many ridiculing the fact he was still tweeting a week-old map to prove an irrelevant point while the storm was actually hitting the Carolinas and had just ravaged the Bahamas.\n\nSome pointed out that even if Alabama had been in the storm\u2019s path, it was simply unacceptable for the president to be sharing outdated forecast maps while the storm was currently affecting people who required up-to-date information.\n\nSee a round-up of Twitter\u2019s commentary below:\n\nThis is too perfect. As I conjectured when all this clown show began, he misinterpreted the wind probability maps (5-10%, and 0% after these) and mixed them up with the cone.\n\n\n\nBut he's unable to recognize even that silly mistake. https://t.co/5DtIyu92Pu \u2014 Alberto Cairo (@AlbertoCairo) September 5, 2019\n\nAccording to your rationale, it was also going to hit (wait for it) Atlanta and Chattanooga. https://t.co/vilNvzWGPO \u2014 G O L D I E.

The NHC puts out models 4x daily during a major event (like Dorian). This one is from last Thursday\n\n\n\nHe's clinging to a single estimate from one week and 49 models ago. And there have been 29 additional models AL was in the cone. https://t.co/a0BLOilNtT \u2014 Ryan Sloane (@RyanFSloane) September 5, 2019\n\nFFS dude, LET IT GO. https://t.co/jsgnQvyf6S \u2014 David Flor (@BrainClouds) September 5, 2019\n\nPolitics aside, it is unacceptable for the President of the United States to be sharing and discussing outdated forecast maps for Dorian while the hurricane is *currently* having dangerous impacts in the Carolinas. https://t.co/OVRgHeP60g \u2014 Sam Lillo (@splillo) September 5, 2019\n\nEither Trump is spending his days being an internet troll or he's really this unhinged.\n\n\n\nWhat a time to be alive. https://t.co/Z65Mvx53eX \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) September 5, 2019\n\nAs the storm is literally battering the Carolinas, Trump is showing forecasts from Wednesday/Thursday of last week to justify tweeting on Sunday of this week that \"Alabama will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\" https://t.co/WcsFYW7ZLv \u2014 Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) September 5, 2019\n\nThe storm is actually battering the Carolinas right now. https://t.co/q4wylEIc8l \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) September 5, 2019\n\nThis is the weirdest hill to die on. https://t.co/EX3qlomdZZ \u2014 pneumataster (@neontaster) September 5, 2019\n\nNo one:\n\n\n\nAbsolutely no one:\n\n\n\nDonald Trump: https://t.co/x8oAwmV9kJ \u2014 Congressman Tim Ryan (@RepTimRyan) September 5, 2019\n\nThis is performance art, right? https://t.co/rr577aTKvK \u2014 David Corn (@DavidCornDC) September 5, 2019\n\noh my god he's still going https://t.co/xZVT6cvjQu \u2014 Matt Pearce \ud83e\udd85 (@mattdpearce) September 5, 2019\n\nDude.

Also note that those are not hurricane tracks- they are tropical wind speed arrival predictions. See the colorbar at the bottom? AL had a 5% chance of seeing TS-force winds in the next five days.
