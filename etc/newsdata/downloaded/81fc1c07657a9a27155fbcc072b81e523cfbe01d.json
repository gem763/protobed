But I think it\u2019s also ... important to remember that it\u2019s hard to consider yourself a role model ... when you\u2019re still kind of figuring out who you want be yourself.\u201d\n\nQ: You wore many hats on this project \u2013 you co-wrote it, produced it and star in it. Why was this a film you felt so passionate about?\n\nEdgerton: \u201cQuite often when you see this story, and there\u2019s been so many wonderful versions of it, you never really see a super young person playing Henry, and Henry was 25 or 26 when he became king. So this was our chance to not only tell our story for other purposes, political purposes, and extract our own essence out of that story but to put youth in the seat of power.\u201d\n\nQ: What was it like making this film? The battle scenes in particular must have been hard work.\n\nMichod: \u201cThey almost killed me... That sounds like an exaggeration but it\u2019s only a little bit... It was something about the heat and the mud and the stress of it. I mean, it\u2019s so huge.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cWe shot that battle in two weeks. Normally I think (in) a movie of this ambition, you would maybe have five weeks to do it ... I remember driving away from that battlefield when we\u2019d finished it, just feeling like I\u2019d survived something and feeling traumatized ... Anyway it looks good in the movie, I think, now.\u201d\n\nQ: Is there a hope the film will help modernize Shakespeare for younger generations, especially given it\u2019s a Netflix movie?\n\nMendelsohn: \u201cWhen you have Timothee Chalamet playing King Henry, you\u2019re opening doors... to an audience that most probably isn\u2019t familiar with the Shakespeare stuff ... Timmy\u2019s a movie star. Timmy\u2019s got bang.\u201d", "description": "Actor Timothee Chalamet plays an unwilling heir who inherits the throne in \"The King\", a mediaeval coming-of-age tale loosely based on William Shakespeare\u2019s plays about Prince Hal and his transformation into England's King Henry V.", "authors": ["Hanna Rantala", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436602131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920R3"}
