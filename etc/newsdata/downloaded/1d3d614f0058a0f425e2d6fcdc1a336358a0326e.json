In fact, she's been out here (my pre-teen self lived for her Nickelodeon days), but she's come a long way since True Jackson, VP. With a career that includes staring in multiple films, releasing albums, and co-hosting Good Morning America, Keke can seemingly conquer anything, including recently garnering her fair share of headlines for her part in the star-studded cast of the most talked-about movie of the year, Hustlers. If you haven\u2019t seen the movie, I won\u2019t spoil it, but let\u2019s just say Keke\u2019s glow-up isn\u2019t just from copious amounts of glitter. Ahead, Keke talks skincare, her impressive career, and of course what it was like to work alongside the one and only Jennifer Lopez.\n\nOn the Hustlers cast\u2026\n\nView photos\n\n\u201cI loved all the cast members,\u201d Keke told us, \u201cbut I really bonded with my girl Lili Reinhart because we did so much together, and our characters were close in the film. And so she and I actually spent so much time working together on set, plus we\u2019re both Virgos.\u201d\n\nOn Jenifer Lopez, specifically\u2026\n\nWe're not the only ones impressed by Jenifer Lopez's training for Hustlers\u2014Keke is a fan too. As she stated, \u201cJ.Lo\u2019s health routine had me like, Oh, girl. She doesn\u2019t drink or smoke. I wasn\u2019t sure I could commit to that because I like to have a drink sometimes, but that\u2019s why she looks as amazing as she does.\u201d\n\nHer go-to hair product while filming Hustlers\u2026\n\nKeke shared, \u201cFor my hair, we really stuck to using pro-style gel. That was my saving grace for my character, Mercedes\u2019s, look.\u201d\n\nView photos\n\nAmpro Style Protein Styling Gel ($4)", "description": "All under $120.", "authors": ["Jasmine Fox-Suliaman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gORV38GJok2QUM08O01.JA--~B/aD04MDA7dz02MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/who_what_wear_581/0049098c762654cee29bd5b0c5427357", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
