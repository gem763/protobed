A businesswoman who has described herself as \u201ca real Democrat,\u201d Ms. Newman also ran in 2018 against Mr. Lipinski and lost by about 2,000 votes.\n\n\u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview.", "description": "The progressive congresswoman\u2019s endorsement of Marie Newman, who is seeking to oust the conservative-leaning Representative Daniel Lipinski, reflects a careful political calculus.", "authors": ["Catie Edmondson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/us/politics/15dc-aoc1/15dc-aoc1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
