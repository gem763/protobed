Jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding: \u201cHis dedication to Israel and to seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians won\u2019t be forgotten. He will be missed. Thank you Jason!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn Greenblatt's absence, Avi Berkowitz, a longtime aide to Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, will take on an expanded role in the talks, as will the State Department's special representative to Iran, Brian Hook.\n\nThe White House began taking steps at the end of last year to make Greenblatt\u2019s departure a smooth transition, including involving Berkowitz more, integrating Greenblatt and Hook\u2019s teams at State and building out the White House\u2019s own team, a senior administration official said.\n\nGreenblatt was one of Kushner\u2019s chief negotiators and a point person in the region as the White House crafted its long-awaited blueprint for peace in the region. The plan, which the president has long touted as the \u201cdeal of the century,\u201d has been delayed numerous times; it is not expected to be rolled out before elections in Israel later this month that will decide whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reelected.\n\nGreenblatt, an adviser on Israel to the 2016 Trump campaign, was tapped for the Middle East envoy job shortly after Trump\u2019s election. He had previously served as the executive vice president and chief legal officer for the Trump Organization.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

This vision has the potential to vastly improve the lives of millions of Israelis, Palestinians and others in the region,\u201d he continued, thanking his wife and family. \u201cI will thoroughly miss working with my friends and colleagues Jared Kushner, David Friedman and Avi Berkowitz, as well as the many other dedicated individuals within the US government who were instrumental in our efforts.\u201d\n\nWhat little of the administration's peace plan has been unveiled \u2014 an economic stimulus package intended to jumpstart local economies \u2014 landed with a thud and was dismissed by Palestinians as a \u201csnow job\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars. A subsequent Israeli-Palestinian economic summit in Bahrain helmed by the White House was not attended by any officials from Israel or Palestine.\n\nThe plan has also been threatened by escalating tensions with Iran in a summer during which Washington and Tehran have at times appeared on the brink of a military conflict, though it now appears as though both sides are open to talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nA senior administration official said Wednesday that Greenblatt\u2019s exit was his own choice, and that despite the stalled peace efforts, he continued to hold the confidence of Trump and his senior team. He originally intended to join the administration for two years to analyze the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to draft a realistic and implementable vision to help solve the conflict and to work on developing relationships between Israel and the region, the official said.\n\nThey also said that the White House\u2019s blueprint is complete but will be released when appropriate.\n\nKushner showered praise on Greenblatt for his work, saying in a statement he\u2019d done a \u201ctremendous job.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis work has helped develop the relationships between Israel and its neighbors as he is trusted and respected by all of the leaders throughout the region,\u201d Kushner said in a statement. \u201cHe is a close friend and partner and will continue to make a positive impact on the world.\u201d\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman also joined the chorus of praise, calling Greenblatt \u201ca trusted friend and a valued colleague who has touched so many with his wisdom, sincerity and good will. He has made an enormous and indelible contribution which we will seek to build upon as we move forward.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu praised Greenblatt in a tweet from his office\u2019s official account, offering thanks to Greenblatt \u201cfor his dedicated work on behalf of security and peace, and for not hesitating for a moment to speak out and tell the truth against all those who spoke ill of the State of Israel.\u201d\n\nNahal Toosi contributed to this report.", "description": "Greenblatt, an adviser on Israel to the 2016 Trump campaign, was tapped for the Middle East envoy job shortly after Trump\u2019s election.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6e/cb/4e55800f4c339a8f661d3111bb77/1985-jason-greenblatt-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
