We will do all three. And we will do it well.\u201d\n\nRep. Andy Kim, New Jersey Democrat and member of the newly founded National Security Caucus, told reporters that during the two-week break his constituents were much more concerned with the Syria issue than with impeachment.\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line is the reckless decision of this president sends a very clear message to those friends into those partners. And that is the American handshake doesn\u2019t matter. That we won\u2019t be there for you when you need us. And that\u2019s a dangerous message,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jason Crow said of the Syrian issue.\n\nRepublicans, who have been staunchly defending the president on the impeachment front, have strongly pushed back against the Syrian troop withdrawal, with one member removing his official support for Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nDemocrats are confident that frustrated Republicans will join them to jointly chastise Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping with this resolution, not only to be able to apply pressure, but to, to give that signal to world leaders that the United States Congress understands the dangerousness of the course that this president has put us on,\u201d Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clarke said.\n\nMajority Leader Steny H. Hoyer told reporters Wednesday the House will also take up a stringent sanctions resolution, though there\u2019s no set timeline for a vote until the resolution is finalized.\n\nDemocrats are laser-focused on the Syria issue Wednesday, ahead of a bipartisan meeting with the president, after all eyes were on the decision against holding an impeachment inquiry vote.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Democratic leadership will attend the meeting.\n\nHowever, Mr. Hoyer is not confident that Wednesday\u2019s meeting will be \u201cconstructive.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr. Trump defended his decision to pull back American troops, saying Syria was \u201cnot our problem.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
