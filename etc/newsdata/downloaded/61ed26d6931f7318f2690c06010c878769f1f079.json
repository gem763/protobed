Her burns covered 28 per cent of her body and covered her stomach, back and legs\n\nSaffron underwent a seven hour procedure in hospital to remove the damaged tissue before doctors stapled her grafted skin together\n\nSaffron said that on the day of the incident her mother Chrissy (centre with Saffron and son Caleb) came down the stairs and 'just started screaming and grabbing towels'\n\n'I was burned across 28 per cent of my body so had to have loads of skin grafts.\n\n'They're a pretty nasty procedure, especially for a child.\n\n'They had to staple the skin together and then later take the staples out - I still find that gruesome to think about even now.'\n\nSaffron spent more than three months in hospital after a seven hour procedure to remove the damaged tissue before doctors stapled her grafted skin together and was sent home wearing a full body splint to keep it in place for six weeks.\n\nOver the course of her life, she has had 18 skin grafts taken from the remaining healthy tissue on her stomach and legs.\n\nSaffron is still undergoing laser treatment today to help the skin stretch as a serious burn injury cannot completely heal, meaning she must constantly go for hospital check-ups and physio.\n\nShe said: 'I think quite a lot of people don't realise that it's not actually burnt skin that is so problematic, it's the necrotic tissue - the skin actually becomes toxic and that's what they have to remove.\n\nSaffron's mother (left) was seven months' pregnant at the time with the 22-year-old's brother Caleb\n\nLooking back at the harrowing event, Saffron thanked her mother, Chrissy (right), father, John (left), 48 and brother, Caleb (second from left), 17, for their support\n\n'I'm still going for procedures 20 years later, there's a lot of work that goes into making sure the skin stretches as I grow.\n\n'I think that's another thing that people don't realise about a burns injury, it never properly heals, you will always need treatment.'\n\nAs Saffron became a teenager, the emotional impact of her scars started to take a real toll on her life, as she battled with questions about how it would affect her relationships and people staring at her on the beach.\n\nThe youngster, who was once called a 'freak', even struggled to get changed in front of her peers in PE lessons.\n\nBut with the support of her mother, Chrissy, 46, father, John, 48 and brother, Caleb, 17, survivor Saffron has learned to ignore the comments and embrace the skin she's in.\n\nSaffron is now using her painful experience to help other people with serious burns injuries at support camps\n\nNow she even claims she's glad it happened as her experience of helping other people with serious burns injuries at support camps inspired her to write her dissertation.\n\nShe said: 'When I was 13 I started to struggle with what had happened to me.. When you're a teenager the last thing you want is to be different and having people staring at you.\n\n'I remember as we started to get older and we would get changed for PE together I realised how different it made me.\n\n'People have always asked me questions like how it affects my relationships and I've even been asked if I can have children.\n\n'I do still struggle with people staring at me but I've always been pushed by my family not to worry about what other people think and to be confident - if anything it's other people that treat me like I'm special.\n\n'I live by the coast and I've always loved going in the sea, so eventually I realised that if I let myself stop doing things for fear of people looking at me then I wouldn't be living my life to the fullest.\n\n'I can stand now stand in front of a camera with confidence because I refuse to let my spark be dampened by my appearance.\n\nSaffron, who lives by the coast and loves going into the sea, has also learnt to ignore comments made by people and no longer lets fear stop her from showing her scars\n\n'In a weird way I'm glad that this happened to me because I've had so many opportunities to help other burns survivors.'\n\nSaffron now volunteers with the Children's Burns Trust, which has helped to launch National Burns Awareness Day by supporting the SafeTea campaign, to raise awareness of the danger of hot drinks after it was revealed that 30 babies go to hospital with a hot drink burn everyday.\n\nShe said her injuries have helped her support the important work the charity does.\n\nSaffron added: 'From a young age I've been going to burns survivor camps where I get to meet other people with injuries like mine.\n\n'Now I go along as a volunteer and I get to meet people much younger than me that have only recently been burned and are trying to come to terms with what has happened to them - I can relate to what they are going through, and hopefully they can find comfort in my journey.\n\n'I definitely think that my burns have made me want to help people and inspired me to study psychology - I even wrote my dissertation on burns support camps, and I'd like to work in trauma psychology one day.'\n\nFor more information on the campaign go to www.cbtrust.org.uk", "description": "Saffron Cohen, 22, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, was just four-years-old when her summer dress caught fire and left her with third degree burns across 28 per cent of her body.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738580-0-image-a-56_1571140112701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
