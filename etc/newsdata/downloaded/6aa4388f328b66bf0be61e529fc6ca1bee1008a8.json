These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69 per cent in the third quarter - compared with a 2023 target of 75 per cent.\n\nIn the third quarter, SAP reported a 10 per cent increase in revenue and a 15 per cent rise in operating profit, after adjusting one-off items and currencies, helping it to achieve an expansion of 1.7 per cent in its operating margins.\n\nThe company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023. SAP is due to update investors on strategy at a capital markets' day in New York on Nov 12.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - [BERLIN] Business software group SAP said on Monday it had reached a three-year deal with Microsoft to help its large enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud. .
