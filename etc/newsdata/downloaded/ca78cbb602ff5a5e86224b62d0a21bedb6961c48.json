George Washington is just an amazing man of God, who trusted in God and led this country to so much greatness,\u201d Mrs. Lynch said.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump kicked off the monument\u2019s reopening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony that included Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, National Mall and Memorial Parks Superintendent Jeff Reinbold and fourth-graders from Amidon-Bowen Elementary School in Southwest Washington, among others.\n\nFor the elevator\u2019s inaugural trip, Mrs. Trump rode with the schoolchildren to the top of the 555-foot-tall Washington Monument.\n\nThe monument\u2019s ticket office opened at 8:30 a.m. and distributed all 760 elevator tickets within a couple of hours.\n\nMany had been waiting in line for tickets long before the sun rose over the National Mall. The first and second people in the line \u2014 Steven Dix of Wichita, Kansas, and Angela Williams of the District of Columbia \u2014 arrived at 3:30 a.m. and quickly became \u201cgreat friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese ladies showed up and it turned out to be a party after a while. It was a real party atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Dix said of Mrs. Williams and her stepdaughters, who were visiting from India.\n\nMr. Dix, 59, said he rescheduled his flight home once he learned that the monument was reopening.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave without going up there,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Williams, 65, said she recently retired as a cultural affairs officer in the Foreign Service. After helping to bring international visitors to the country, she thought it was time she \u201chad a taste of America,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wanted my two stepdaughters to make sure they had the chance to see some of the beauties of America and why it\u2019s so important to me and my work,\u201d she said.\n\nFrank Dennison, 67, was third in line when he arrived at 5:25 a.m. to get tickets for his wife and their 9-year-old grandson. He described the atmosphere as \u201cconvivial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am really looking forward to the expression of joy and exuberance on [my grandson\u2019s] face when we get to the top and he looks out the window,\u201d said Mr. Dennison, who traveled from Austin, Texas, to visit the monument.\n\nElevator tickets are available daily only at the monument until Oct. 18. Beginning Oct. 10, visitors can reserve tickets online for months in advance.\n\nFor most of the past eight years, the Washington Monument was closed intermittently. An August 2011 earthquake cracked the stones near the top and damaged the elevator, which was frequently out of order.\n\n\u201cA trip to the top of the Washington Monument should be on everyone\u2019s bucket list,\u201d said Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service. \u201cAnd now with this new elevator, completely state of the art, we can say with confidence, for the foreseeable future, that the Washington Monument is open for business.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the repaired elevator, the monument\u2019s new $12 million security structure features air conditioning and heating, and requires fewer police staff, park service personnel said. To enter the monument, visitors first must go through metal detectors and an X-ray machine, and are prohibited from bringing food, drinks, strollers, animals or large bags.\n\nThe last time Robert Harrison of Arlington, Virginia, visited the top of the Washington Monument was in the 1960s when he was a child. He remembered having to take the stairs all the way.\n\n\u201cI remember it being more like an attic,\u201d Mr. Harrison, 65, said of the observation deck at the top.\n\nMrs. Lynch, of the Utah book club, said she admires the monument\u2019s symbolism, specifically the many phases of construction. Construction on the monument began in 1848 and took nearly 40 years to complete.\n\n\u201cI love the fact that you work to create something, and sometimes things come along that tear it apart and then you keep going, you mend the ties and keep going,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s super symbolic that way.\u201d\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
