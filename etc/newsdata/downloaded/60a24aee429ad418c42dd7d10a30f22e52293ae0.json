That led the corporate and investment bank division to its best third quarter in three years.\n\nJPMorgan seized on some late-quarter volatility in fixed-income markets, pushing trading revenue higher than what Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon had forecast just a few weeks earlier. Increased flows in rates and commodities drove the gains in debt trading, Chief Financial Officer Jenn Piepszak said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nAnd even as global trade tensions weighed on cross-border dealmaking and companies from WeWork to Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. shelved plans for initial public offerings, JPMorgan managed a 9% increase in banking fees on the strength of debt and equity underwriting.\n\n\u201cJPMorgan stacks up very well relative to its competitors in the U.S, particularly in the capital-markets area,\u201d Fred Cannon, an analyst at KBW, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nShares of the company rose 1.3% to $117.92 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. They\u2019ve jumped 21% this year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell as much as 3.2% after the bank reported a $267 million markdown on public equity wagers and investment-banking revenue that missed analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nDimon tempered expectations for trading revenue last month, saying he wasn\u2019t \u201cjumping for joy\u201d at the prospect of a 10% jump in the metric because the gain is compared with a weak third quarter in 2018. The actual increase was 14%.\n\nThe strength in fixed-income trading was offset by a surprise 5% decline in equity-trading revenue, to $1.5 billion, which the bank blamed on derivatives. Analysts had been expecting a 5% increase.\n\nJPMorgan had been expected to benefit from a pullback by Deutsche Bank AG in equities. The bank has been investing in electronic technology and sharpening its focus on trade execution, trying to unseat Morgan Stanley as Wall Street\u2019s top stock-trading shop.\n\nRepo rates surged late last month, providing an opportunity for banks to profit from the swings that left hedge funds and broker-dealers scrambling for cash.\n\nTrading Challenges\n\nWall Street trading desks have been struggling to revamp their businesses as a shift to passive investing, struggles among hedge funds and moves to cheaper electronic trading have made banks\u2019 securities units less profitable. The five biggest U.S. banks saw a collective $5 billion drop in trading revenue in the first half of the year.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s third-quarter investment-banking fees rose 8.7% to $1.98 billion thanks to stronger-than-expected results from the bank\u2019s capital-markets team. Fees from helping companies raise money through bond deals and stock offerings increased 18% to $1.47 billion. Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions slumped 13% to $506 million, worse than expectations for a 7% drop.\n\nThe bank\u2019s book of what it considers core loans contracted for only the second time since the Federal Reserve started increasing interest rates in 2015. Average core loans fell to $900.6 billion from $905.8 billion in the previous quarter, driven by decreased lending in the consumer and investment-banking divisions. Loans to medium-sized companies and to clients of its asset and wealth-management group increased.\n\n(Updates with CFO\u2019s comment in the third paragraph, share price in sixth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Gwen Everett.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michelle F.
