But here, compassion crossed the line into coercion.\u201d\n\nGuyger was found guilty of murder Tuesday morning for the Sept. 6, 2018, slaying. In her testimony, she claimed she mistook Jean for an intruder and acted out of self-defense.\n\nAfter an emotional two-day sentencing hearing that included testimony from both the Guyger and Jean families, she was sentenced to a decade in prison and will be eligible for parole in five years.\n\nTwo jurors, identified by the court as Juror 21 and 34, said in a Friday interview with Good Morning America that deciding Guyger\u2019s sentence was \u201cone of the hardest things\u201d they\u2019ve had to do. The pair said they took into consideration what Jean would have wanted\u2014knowing they could face backlash for not giving her a stiffer sentence.\n\n\u201cThey were asking us to take an eye for an eye for Botham, and I feel like he isn\u2019t someone who would take an eye for an eye,\u201d Juror 21 said. \u201cHe would turn the other cheek.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how many years we would have gave Amber Guyger, it\u2019s not bringing Botham back,\u201d Juror 34 added. \u201cIt was a mistake, and the 10 years will be enough time for her to get back out there and try to do something better with her life.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling initially sparked protests at the courthouse, they were quickly quenched after Jean\u2019s 18-year-old brother, Brandt, publicly forgave Guyger in an emotional impact statement and gave her a hug that elicited audible sobs in the room.\n\nKemp then had private conversations with both the Jean family and Guyger, at one point offering the former cop a Bible and reading the passage John 3:16 during their four-minute exchange.\n\n\u201cThis has been put in front of you for a reason,\u201d the judge told Guyger. \u201cHe has a purpose for you.\u201d\n\nBefore Guyger was escorted out of the courtroom to begin her sentence, Kemp hugged her and said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t done as much as you think you have and you can be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation alleges that while most of the exchange was inaudible, enough can be heard \u201cto show an ethics violation\u201d that should be further investigated.\n\n\u201cJudge Kemp is free to attend church as a private citizen,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cShe may even proselytize in her private life or teach Sunday school, and so forth. However, it violates a vital constitutional principle for a sitting judge to promote personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity.\u201d\n\nKemp\u2019s office declined to comment on the complaint. Dallas County District Attorney John Cruezo told CBS he would \u201cintercede and protect\u201d Kemp against any complaints.\n\n\u201cIf anyone complained, I would do everything I could to support the appropriateness of it,\u201d Creuzo said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you I\u2019ve done the same exact thing, but I have spoken to defendants, have I given them a hug, perhaps, Not given a Bible, that\u2019s not me, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inappropriate about what she did, and I would support that, if anyone tried to file a complaint, I would do my best to intercede and protect her.\u201d\n\nWhile the non-profit notes they believe Kemp has the right to express her faith as a private citizen, they claim she acted unconstitutionally by bringing her religion into the courtroom while she was representing the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cWe, too, believe our criminal justice system needs more compassion from judges and prosecutors. But here, compassion crossed the line into coercion. And there can be few relationships more coercive than a sentencing judge in a criminal trial and a citizen accused and convicted of a crime,\u201d the complaint added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Texas-based First Liberty Institute responded to the complaint, saying they believe Kemp\u2019s actions showed compassion, not incompetence.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s largest legal organization advocating for religious rights, the Institute slammed the complaint for going against the \u201crest of the nation\u201d in \u201ccelebrating\u201d Kemp\u2019s \u201ccompassion and mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should all be thankful the law allows Judge Kemp\u2019s actions and we stand with her and will gladly lead the charge in defending her noble and legal actions,\u201d the group\u2019s general counsel, Hiram Sasser, said in a statement provided to The Daily Beast on Friday.\n\nThe Jean family\u2019s attorney, S.Lee Meritt, praised Kemp\u2019s actions on CNN Thursday evening, calling it \u201ca human moment\u201d inspired by Brandt Jean\u2019s moving testimony.\n\n\u201cI think it had everything to do with [Kemp] being a human in that moment. This young man had shown amazing strength of character in extending love and forgiveness to Amber Guyger,\u201d Merritt told CNN host Anderson Cooper. \u201cI think [Kemp] got caught up in the moment.\u201d", "description": "Dallas County Judge Tammy Kemp hugged Amber Guyger and offered her a Bible moments after the ex-cop was sentenced to 10 years for murdering her black neighbor, Botham Jean.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3780,w_6720,x_0,y_118/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570207077/RTX75UDI_qz9tiz", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
