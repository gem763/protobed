Acyclovir, branded as Zovirax, is approved for herpes infections - like cold sores, shingles and chickenpox - but experimental for HFMD.\n\nJust a day later, their rashes started to clear, with them all experiencing 'complete resolution' within 72 hours.\n\nHFMD has no specific treatment, with patients being forced to endure itching, fever and mouth ulcers for between seven and 10 days.\n\nAlthough most strains of the virus are harmless, one - EV71 - has been linked to heart failure, central nervous system disorders and bleeding in the lungs.\n\nAn expert told MailOnline it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the case report, adding most HFMD cases are 'mild and self-limiting'.\n\nAn unnamed two-year-old boy was taken to Florida State University College of Medicine by his mother after an 'eruption' of blisters appeared on his legs (right), buttocks and genitals, before spreading to his hands and feet (left). He had also been battling a fever for around a day\n\nBlisters also covered the palms of the two-year-old boy's hands (pictured)\n\nThe family were all given the anti-viral drug acyclovir (stock) within 24 hours of their lesions\n\nDr Adrian Raby, of Imperial College London, told MailOnline: 'The case reports look interesting.\n\n'I do note it is not a trial though, so it would be difficult to draw any strong conclusions from it. All the cases I have seen have been mild and self limiting.'\n\nHFMD is a highly contagious viral condition, the medical team wrote in the American Journal of Medical Case Reports.\n\nIt most often occurs in children under 10, with outbreaks typically taking place at schools, nurseries and summer camps.\n\nSymptoms include a flat, red rash, as well as mild fever, muscle pain and a general feeling of 'malaise'.\n\nHFMD has no specific treatment due to most cases being 'benign' and having a 'complete resolutions of symptoms' as soon as a week after infection.\n\nHowever, acyclovir has been found to relieve discomfort and speed up recovery in three previous studies.\n\nAn unnamed two-year-old boy arrived at the medical college's primary care clinic with his mother after battling a fever for a day.\n\nAn 'eruption' of blisters then appeared on his legs, buttocks and genitals, before spreading to his hands and feet.\n\nMedics, led by Dr Aman Kataria, also found small lesions on the lining of the boy's cheeks and behind his lips. These had ulcerated but were not painful.\n\nHis mother claimed there was a case of HFMD at her son's daycare the week before.\n\nA day after the boy was diagnosed, his brother arrived with fever, malaise and a single lesion on his hand. Twenty-four hours later, their mother came back with the same symptoms.\n\nShe had previously suffered from follicular lymphoma (FL), a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).\n\nNHL occurs when the body makes abnormal immune-fighting cells. These usually build up in the lymph nodes, however, FL can start in other parts of the body.\n\nTo be on the safe side, doctors removed and biopsied her lesion, which came back clear.\n\nThe toddler also had blisters on his knee (left). He was treated with the experimental anti-viral drug acyclovir. A day later, he stopped developing new lesions, with his existing blemishes also shrinking (seen right). The boy's itching and fever also went down\n\nOnce diagnosed, the two brothers were given 200mg of acyclovir orally four times a day. Their mother received 800mg, also four times a day.\n\nAfter just one day of treatment, the siblings stopped developing new lesions, with their existing blemishes also shrinking. Their itching and fever also went down.\n\nWithin three days, the boys achieved 'complete resolution', while their mother recovered after just 24 hours.\n\nAcyclovir is thought to boost a patient's production of proteins called interferons. These are released by cells in the presence of viruses to heighten immune response.\n\nAlthough HFMD is rarely serious, it can cause 'significant distress', with patients also usually being contagious until their rash disappears, the medical team wrote.\n\nYoung children and adults with an impaired immune system may be particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe team believe acyclovir may be useful during HFMD outbreaks but should first have its effectiveness tested in a large trial.\n\nThe treatment also helped to quickly clear up the blemishes on the boy's hands (pictured)", "description": "Doctors from Florida State University College of Medicine treated two brothers, aged two and four, and their mother, 37, with the drug acyclovir after they all developed the disease's tell-tale rash.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19296760-0-image-a-115_1570193138999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
