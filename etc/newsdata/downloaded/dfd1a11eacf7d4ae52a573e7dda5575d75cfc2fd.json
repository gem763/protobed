Although Dennis Murphy will not be reading any notes at Parys, he still stands a good chance to keep his current podium positions.\n\nImage: Nadia Jordaan\n\nIf the cards fall right for De Villiers at Parys, he can push past the newly crowned Class T champions Lance Woolridge and Ward Huxtable (Ford Castrol Cross Country Ranger) on the overall standings to finish as the runner-up.\n\nThe Ford team are currently second with five points the difference and they would like to keep this status quo. This scenario sets the stage for an exciting three-way battle and interesting race tactics.\n\nPlaces up for grabs\n\nThe final two teams in the overall top five line-up will lock horns at Parys for the best position. Shameer Variawa/Juan M\u00f6hr (Toyota Gazoo Racing Hilux) will take on Chris Visser/Danie Stassen (Atlas Copco Toyota Hilux) for the best positions in the overall top five.\n\nBoth teams are also capable of victory and it would be a perfect way to end their seasons. There will be three Red-Lined Motorsport Nissan Navaras on the start line in the FIA Class with Ernest Roberts/Henry Kohne hoping to finish the season on the same high note they started while Terence Marsh will again team up with Letshego Zulu who will read the notes.\n\nImage: Nadia Jordaan\n\nZulu has also recently taken up her business chair in Red-Lined Media and Marketing and has navigated for Marsh on numerous occasions in the past including earlier this year at the Berg 400.\n\nThe international team of Thomas Bell/Patrick McMurren (Red-Lined Motorsport Nissan Navara) will also participate in the Parys 400 and will be one of three international teams competing in the Free State.\n\nA last helping of points will be perfect for Johan van Staden/Mike Lawrenson (Elf Renault Duster) in the FIA Class while Clint Weston has teamed up with Elvene Vonk in the King Price Extreme for the Parys 400.\n\nInteresting battles\n\nVonk sat next to Schalk Burger during the season in preparation for their 2020 Dakar Rally attempt, but Burger was recently injured during their final practice session in Namibia.\n\nThe German driver, Daniel Schr\u00f6der, will also be visiting South Africa and has again teamed up with Ryan Bland from KwaZulu-Natal in the PS Laser Nissan Navara prepared by WCT Engineering while the Brazilian team of Marcos Baumgart and Kleber Cincea (Ford Castrol Cross Country Ranger) will be Woolridge/Huxtable\u2019s team-mates in Class T.\n\nImage: Nadia Jordaan\n\nIn Class T Johan Horn (Malalane Toyota Hilux) will have Leander Pienaar reading the notes, as brother Werner will be in Japan, and an interesting ding-dong battle can be expected between them and Jacques van Tonder/Nico Swartz (Ford Ranger) as the podium and final standings could look different after the Parys 400.\n\nGary Bertholdt/Geoff Minnitt (Atlas Copco Hilux) can never be left out of the equation and a good result and a healthy haul of points will be the ideal way to round off the season.\n\nImage: Nadia Jordaan\n\nWors Prinsloo/Andr\u00e9 Vermeulen (Ford Ranger) as well as Dylan Venter/Donavan Lubbe (4x4 Mega World ARB Toyota Hilux) will hope for an uneventful race as will Richard Leeke and Zaheer Bodhanya who are back in Class T after their recent podium finish in the FIA Class at Lichtenburg.\n\nIn Class S, David Huddy and Gerhard Schutte (Hud Racing Nissan Navara) have successfully defended their title and a hundred percent finish rate will round off their perfect season.
