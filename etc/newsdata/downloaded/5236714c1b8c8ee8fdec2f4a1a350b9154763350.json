The study suggests a correlation but not causation.\n\n\"This study gives another piece of the puzzle showing increased risk of using antidepressants during pregnancy,\" said Anick B\u00e9rard, a professor at the University of Montreal in Canada and director of research on medications and pregnancy at CHU Sainte-Justine Medical Center, who was senior author of the study.\n\n\"Depression needs to be treated during pregnancy. There are many forms of treatments -- antidepressants is one of them,\" she said. \"If a woman is pregnant and is taking antidepressants, she should not stop by herself but should have an informed discussion with her treating physician to assess the best way forward.\"\n\nGestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy in women, can increase the risk of certain complications for both the mother and baby, including risks of high blood pressure for the expectant mother, needing a cesarean section delivery, having low blood sugar for the baby and developing type 2 diabetes later in life for the baby.\n\nThe study involved data on 237,172 pregnancies in Canada. The data, from 1998 to 2015, came from the research tool Quebec Pregnancy Cohort.\n\nOut of those pregnancies, 20,905 included cases of gestational diabetes. Among the pregnancies with a gestational diabetes diagnosis, 1,152 also had been exposed to antidepressants.\n\nAfter analyzing that data and taking a close look at antidepressant exposure, the researchers found that specifically venlafaxine and amitriptyline were associated with a 27% and 52% increased risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nWhile the risk was greatest for those two antidepressants, the researchers also found that gestational diabetes risk increased with the longer any antidepressant was taken.\n\n\"Short term use was associated with a 15% heightened risk; medium term use was associated with a 17% heightened risk; and long term use with a 29% heightened risk,\" B\u00e9rard said. \"The increases remain small but above what we would have expected.\"\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that it is an observational study and more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a more diverse group of women, as 88.5% of the pregnancies in the data were among women of a Caucasian background.\n\nMore research also is needed to determine why an association between antidepressant use and gestational diabetes exists, but B\u00e9rard has some ideas.\n\nJUST WATCHED Giving birth in the US is more dangerous than you think Replay More Videos ...
