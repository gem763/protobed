(AP) \u2014 Kelly Bryant's last throw of the game was a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Knox late in the first half of Missouri's 42-10 victory over Troy. The Tigers (4-1) hope it isn't the last pass of Bryant's college career.\n\nAfter he released the throw, Bryant was hit low from behind by Troy defensive tackle Travis Sailo and immediately clutched his left knee. Sailo was penalized for a personal foul on the play. The senior quarterback, a transfer from Clemson, eventually walked to the locker room but didn't return to the game or the sideline. Missouri didn't immediately specify the diagnosis other than calling it a left leg injury.\n\nBryant completed 12 of 19 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns ran for another touchdown. Taylor Powell, a sophomore, took over at quarterback in the second half and completed 6 of 8 passes for 57 yards but didn't guide the Tigers to any points. Jonathan Nance and Albert Okwuegbunam joined Knox with touchdown catches, and Larry Rountree III rushed for a touchdown.\n\nMissouri linebacker Cale Garrett intercepted passes on consecutive drives in the second quarter and returned the second one 33 yards for a touchdown. Garrett has scored touchdowns in three straight games. The Tigers, who entered the game ranked third nationally in total defense, held Troy (2-3) to 211 total yards.\n\nThe Trojans scored first on Kaleb Barker's 15-yard touchdown pass to Khalil McClain on their first drive of the game. Missouri scored six straight touchdowns to take a 42-7 halftime lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMissouri: Sophomore defensive end Trajan Jeffcoat is no longer enrolled in school or part of the team, Missouri announced. Jeffcoat played in every game as a true freshman. He missed the first four games of this season because of an elbow injury, but coach Barry Odom said Tuesday he expected Jeffcoat to play against Troy. Missouri said in an official statement it would not comment on the reason for Jeffcoat's departure.\n\nTroy: Barker entered the day averaging 341.8 passing yards per game. But he hadn't faced a defense like Missouri's. Barker completed 15 of 26 passes for 92 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions, before being replaced by Gunnar Watson late in the second quarter. Watson finished the game, completing 5 of 9 passes for 58 yards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMissouri: The Tigers finish a five-game homestand against Mississippi on Saturday.\n\nTroy: The Trojans will play host to South Alabama on Oct. 16.\n\n_______\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
