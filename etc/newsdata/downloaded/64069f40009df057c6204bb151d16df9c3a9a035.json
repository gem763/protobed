In the video, the victim is then seen driving back into the parking lot as the suspect does the same.\n\nKTRK\n\nSeconds later, the suspect is seen getting out of his car and smashing two of the victim's windows, before appearing to lean into the driver's side window and attempting to hit the driver.\n\n\"All it took was the lightest of brushes with the car. Literally that's all it took,\" the victim said. \"I know that if he did that to me, he is going to do that again someday to someone else.\"\n\n\"You cannot attack people like that. That's not right,\" store manager Kamh Vinh said.\n\nThe incident, which took place on Wednesday around 7 p.m. in the parking lot of King Cole Liquor in Houston's Montrose neighborhood, has been reported to police. The victim was not seriously injured.", "description": "Surveillance footage has captured the moment a man unleashed a brutal tire iron attack on another motorist after a car accident in a liquor store parking lot in Houston,", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/surveillance2-ht-ml-191008_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
