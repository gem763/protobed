Mens Launch in Los Angeles on Friday\n\n'She\u2019s creative,' he said. 'She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense.

'She was like, \u2018If you don\u2019t put this s*** out, I\u2019m putting it out on your behalf for you. I\u2019m getting your Spotify login and doing this s*** myself.\u201d '\n\nMeanwhile, Cody shared part of the track on Instagram last week.", "description": "The 22-year-old singer sang praises of his new lady love while at the star-studded launch of\u00a0Tiffany & Co.
