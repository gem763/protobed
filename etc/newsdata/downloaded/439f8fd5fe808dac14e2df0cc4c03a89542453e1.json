You\u2019re on camera \u2013 or you were at some point in the past few years \u2013 and now your face is public domain.\n\nFacial recognition technology is everywhere, and only becoming more pervasive. It\u2019s marketed as a security feature by companies like Apple and Google to prevent strangers from unlocking your iPhone or front door.\n\nIt\u2019s also used by government agencies like police departments. More than half of adult Americans\u2019 faces are logged in police databases, according to a study by Georgetown researchers. Facial recognition technology is used by governments across the globe to identify and track dissidents, and has been deployed by police against Hong Kong protesters.\n\nTo push back, privacy-focused designers, academics, and activists have designed wearable accessories and clothes meant to thwart facial recognition tech.\n\nRead more: How police are using technology like drones and facial recognition to track people across the US\n\nFacial recognition software uses artificial intelligence to detect faces or human figures in real-time. But that software is fallible \u2013 clothing can \u201cdazzle\u201d the software with misleading shapes that stop the AI from knowing what it\u2019s looking at. Other designs confuse AI with images of decoy faces, preventing it from making the right identification.\n\nThese designs are still niche, and have mostly only appeared as art installations or academic projects. But as facial recognition becomes more widespread, they may catch on as the next trend in functional fashion.\n\nHere are the ingenious, bizarre designs meant to outsmart facial recognition tech.\n\nA lens-shaped mask makes its user undetectable to facial recognition algorithms while still allowing humans to read facial expressions and identity.\n\nsource HKU Design/Jip van Leeuwenstein\n\nThe \u201csurveillance exclusion\u201d mask was designed by Jip van Leeuwenstein while he was a student of Utrecht School of the Arts in the Netherlands.\n\nThe mask\u2019s curvature blocks facial recognition from all angles.\n\nsource HKU Design/Jip van Leeuwenstein\n\n\u201cBecause of its transparency you will not lose your identity and facial expressions,\u201d von Leeuwenstein writes, \u201cso it\u2019s still possible to interact with the people around you.\u201d\n\nA Dutch design student invented a projector that superimposes an image of a different face over that of the wearer.\n\nsource HKU Design/Jin-cai Liu\n\nJing-cai Liu created the wearable face projector, a \u201csmall beamer projects a different appearance on your face, giving you a completely new appearance.\u201d\n\nThe device shifts rapidly between faces being projected, making detection even more difficult.\n\nsource HKU Design/Jin-cai Liu\n\nImages of Liu\u2019s face projector went viral last month after misleading tweets claimed it was being used by protesters in Hong Kong. This claim was later debunked.\n\nA Japanese college professor designed goggles fitted with LEDs that thwart facial recognition.\n\nsource National Institute of Informatics/Isao Echizen\n\nIsao Echizen, a professor at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, designed the \u201cprivacy visor\u201d as a safeguard against security cameras that could log someone\u2019s face without their permission.\n\nImages from Echizen\u2019s lab shows how the visor blocks AI\u2019s ability to detect a face.\n\nsource National Institute of Informatics/Isao Echizen\n\nThe device is fitted with \u201ca near-infrared LED that appends noise to photographed images without affecting human visibility.\u201d\n\nWhen switched on, a user\u2019s face no longer scans as a human face to the AI, indicated by the lack of green boxes above.\n\nAn artist designed a toolkit of avant-garde makeup and styling tips that can make faces unrecognizable to AI.\n\nsource Coreana Museum of Art/Cha Hyun Seok\n\nA makeup technique known as CV Dazzle, first pioneered by the artist Adam Harvey, uses fashion to combat facial recognition. It was recently featured at a workshop at the Coreana Museum of Art in Seoul, pictured here.\n\nCV Dazzle combines makeup, hair extensions, accessories, and gems to transform people\u2019s faces.\n\nsource Cha Hyun Seok/Coreana Museum of Art\n\nThe technique gets its name from a World War I tactic \u2013 naval vessels were painted with black and white stripes, making it harder for distant ships to tell their size and the direction they were pointed.\n\nSanne Weekers, a design student in the Netherlands, created a headscarf decorated with faces intended to confuse algorithms.\n\nsource HKU Design/Sanne Weekers\n\n\u201cBy giving an overload of information software gets confused, rendering you invisible,\u201d Weekers wrote of the scarf.\n\nBelgian scientists developed a prototype for a graphic print that could be added to clothing to \u201cattack\u201d and baffle surveillance technology.\n\nsource KU Leuven/Toon Goedem\u00e9\n\nBelgian computer scientists Simen Thys, Wiebe Van Ranst, and Toon Goedem\u00e9 designed \u201cadversarial patches\u201d as part of a study funded by KU Leuven.\n\n\u201cWe believe that, if we combine this technique with a sophisticated clothing simulation, we can design a T-shirt print that can make a person virtually invisible for automatic surveillance cameras,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nAn artist created masks that evade facial recognition and send a message about invasions of privacy.\n\nsource Christine Butler/Courtesy of Zach Blas\n\n\u201c\u2018Facial Weaponization Suite\u2019 protests against biometric facial recognition \u2013 and the inequalities these technologies propagate \u2013 by making \u2018collective masks\u2019 in workshops that are modeled from the aggregated facial data of participants, resulting in amorphous masks that cannot be detected as human faces by biometric facial recognition technologies,\u201d creator Zach Blas writes.\n\nBlas\u2019 masks also explore the potential of algorithm-driven facial recognition to enact bias and produce false positives.\n\nsource Zach Blas\n\nBlas intended the masks pictured above to depict the \u201ctripartite conception of blackness: the inability of biometric technologies to detect dark skin as racist, the favoring of black in militant aesthetics, and black as that which informatically obfuscates,\u201d he writes.", "description": "Business Insider - Privacy-focused designers, academics, and activists have designed wearable accessories and clothes meant to thwart facial recognition tech..
