USA TODAY\n\nATLANTA \u2014 It\u2019s not hard to create a headline, and the NCAA did that Tuesday. The broad news coming out of the NCAA\u2019s Board of Governors meeting here \u2014 college athletes were finally going to be allowed to profit off their name, image and likeness \u2014 sounded like audacious progress.\n\nIn the broadest sense possible, it\u2019s true. Now that politicians have taken an interest in forcing the NCAA to change its antiquated amateurism rules, the rules are going to change.\n\nBut here\u2019s what the NCAA\u2019s announcement didn't say: It's going to be complicated. It\u2019s going to be difficult to implement and regulate. And at the end of the day, it probably won\u2019t make everyone happy.\n\nIf you think that Tuesday\u2019s announcement means the NCAA is going to allow college athletes to earn whatever they can get from wherever they can get it without any oversight or interference, that\u2019s just not the way this is going to go down. The NCAA understands the need to evolve, but it\u2019s very clear in talking to NCAA president Mark Emmert and others who have been working on this issue that they are not going to blow up their model so that a blue-chip quarterback recruit who might want to play for Alabama closes the deal by getting $200,000 to endorse a booster\u2019s local business.\n\nThe NCAA's top policy-making group on Tuesday voted \"unanimously to permit students participating in athletics the opportunity to benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness in a manner consistent with the collegiate model.\" (Photo: Christian Petersen, Getty Images)\n\n\u201cEverybody that\u2019s been involved in this conversation is really concerned about what an unregulated third party endorsement model could mean and there\u2019s very little support for that,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cSo the discussions have been about how you create a regulatory framework for how you can allow some portion of that but not have it become just another form of a recruiting model.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the NCAA is going to try to thread a really small needle: Allow college athletes to make money based on their inherent popularity while preventing a free-for-all where recruiting is done by the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest elephants in the room,\u201d said Ohio State athletics director Gene Smith, who is co-chairman of the working group along with Big East commissioner Val Ackerman that will spend the next several months drilling down on exactly how to do it.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the NCAA is going to sit on its hands do nothing. Given the legislative pressures on the NCAA at the state and federal level, that\u2019s not really an option anymore. But it also doesn\u2019t mean the NCAA is going to grant name, image and likeness rights without restricting things that might fall outside the so-called \u201ccollegiate model,\u201d a purposely vague phrase that is peppered all over the NCAA\u2019s announcement.\n\nBut it\u2019s really not that complicated. The NCAA is basically going to have to allow athletes make money off their name, image and likeness once they\u2019re in college. They just don\u2019t want that to be part of the process before they arrive on campus where tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars are dictating where recruits decide to play.\n\n\u201cOne of the other clear distinctions that is often overlooked by the general public is the collegiate model is also predicated upon students being recruited and making their own choice about where they\u2019re going to go,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cThere\u2019s no draft. It\u2019s not the Olympics where you go by virtue of your passport. So even though we all recognize some schools have advantages and disadvantages in recruitment, one of the biggest concerns the working group has spent a lot of time on and is going to keep spending time on is how do you allow liberalization and not have it just become part of the recruiting wars? That\u2019s going to be one of the biggest challenges in coming up with real bylaws.\u201d\n\nSmith said his group has discussed \u201ceverything you guys can think of\u201d in terms of addressing that specific problem, but it\u2019s hard to get any real answers about what it would look like.\n\nWhat seems most likely to develop is some type of system where, if a college athlete wants to do an endorsement deal, it has to be approved by the NCAA itself or some independent group to approve it or nix it based on whether it\u2019s market-rate pay and whether it had any relationship to the recruiting process. In other words, get ready to put yet another layer of bureaucracy onto an organization that already ties itself in knots with red tape.\n\n\u201cMaybe it needs minimal regulation or heavy regulation,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We\u2019re just not there yet.\u201d\n\nWhether any of this will satisfy legislators in California or other states who are putting together proposals that have kind of pushed the NCAA to this point is unclear. California State Sen. Nancy Skinner, who authored the bill there, told USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday afternoon that they won\u2019t accept any \"arbitrary limitations\" on college athletes\u2019 right to their name, image and likeness.\n\nAre the NCAA\u2019s guardrails going to be arbitrary? That\u2019s could very well be the next fight here. The NCAA clearly lost the argument on name, image and likeness. It\u2019s happening. The only question is to what degree the system get opened up \u2014 and that very detailed, arduous policy-making process is only just beginning.", "description": "The NCAA's Board of Governors issued guidelines for the prospect of college athletes benefiting from use of their name, image, likeness.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
