I have to defend myself.\n\n(Image: INSTAGRAM)\n\n\"I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn't seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\n\n\"There was no loving message in there, nothing asking about my health, nothing from her saying, 'Let's get together and heal our differences'.\"\n\nPeople magazine had quoted an unnamed friend of Meghan, that the duchess felt her dad did not understand her desire for privacy after he suggested they should pose together for a press photo.\n\nMr Markle said: \"I don't want a picture for any other reason than if we show harmony then the press will back off.\n\n(Image: Tim Rooke/REX)\n\n\"When I opened the letter I was hoping it was the olive branch I'd longed for.\n\n\"I was expecting something that would be a pathway to reconciliation. Instead it was deeply hurtful.\n\n\"I was so devastated I couldn't show it to anyone - and never would have, had it not been for the People magazine piece which meant I had to release portions to defend myself.\"\n\nThis week, Meghan began legal proceedings against the newspaper, claiming it had breached copyright, infringed her privacy and breached the Data Protection Act by publishing the note.\n\nThe claim also alleges the paper edited the letter by \"strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year\".\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\nThe Duke of Sussex recently accused the tabloid press of a \"ruthless campaign\" against his wife, adding: \"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one.\n\n\"Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\"\n\nHarry said about his wife: \"I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday said it intends to defend itself \"vigorously\" if the case ends up in court and denies changing the meaning of the document.", "description": "Thomas Markle, 75, said he released parts of the note to the Mail on Sunday in order to defend himself", "authors": ["Jess Glass", "Image", "Internet Unknown", "Instagram", "Tim Rooke Rex", "Ian Vogler", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19123261.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_MEGHAN-MARKLE-AND-FATHER-THOMAS-MARKLE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
