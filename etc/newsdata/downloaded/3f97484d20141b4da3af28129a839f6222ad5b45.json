At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis? \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 8, 2019\n\nIt also came as Johnson's negotiator, David Frost, was in Brussels continuing to answer technical questions from EU negotiators about the proposal that the U.K. put forward last week. That advanced a complex customs and regulatory arrangement to manage the Ireland-Northern Ireland border in place of the backstop provision that was negotiated by Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nThe EU27 still see that backstop, which would keep the entire U.K. in the EU's customs territory in the event that a free trade deal is not reached by December 31, 2020, as the only workable solution for managing the Irish border. EU officials have insisted that they are still studying the proposal, which they say has numerous flaws. The EU says it needs answers to its questions before resuming formal negotiations.\n\nMany diplomats and officials in Brussels fear that Johnson is angling to blame the EU if and when a deal proves unreachable while also laying the groundwork for his campaign in what is seen as an inevitable national election in the U.K. But Tusk's statement was unusually blunt and provocative \u2014 effectively declaring aloud that he does not regard the U.K. proposal as having been made in good faith.\n\nIt followed a briefing from the U.K. side of a phone call between Johnson and Merkel on Tuesday morning, which all but accused the German chancellor of ending the negotiations. A Downing Street official briefed some journalists that the German leader told Johnson the U.K. cannot leave the European Union without leaving Northern Ireland in a customs union with the EU. That \"means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,\" the official said.\n\nUnder Johnson's plan, Northern Ireland, like the rest of the U.K., would leave the EU's customs union following a transition period \u2014 on January 1, 2021. At that point, if a free trade deal is not in place, the complex new customs and regulatory regime would enter into force, provided that Northern Ireland's devolved government agreed.\n\nThe U.K.'s proposal would establish a new customs border, as well as a new regulatory border \u2014 effectively creating two administrative borders. The EU's longstanding red lines in the negotiation insist on no such borders existing on the island of Ireland.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney quickly weighed in to support Tusk, while stressing that the EU was still open to negotiating a deal. \"Hard to disagree,\" he tweeted, \"reflects the frustration across EU and the enormity of what\u2019s at stake for us all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, pushed back on assertions that talks had broken down.\n\n\u201cWhat I can reiterate is that the EU position has not changed,\u201d Andreeva said. \u201cWe want a deal, we are working for a deal with the United Kingdom, and under no circumstances will we accept that the EU wants to do harm to the Good Friday Agreement. The purpose of our work is to protect is in all its dimensions, and at all times.\u201d\n\nAndreeva added, \u201cTechnical talks are continuing today, so I don\u2019t see how talks could have actually been broken down, if they are happening today, and in the days to continue.\u201d\n\nShe urged journalists at the Commission\u2019s midday press conference to wait for comment from the German chancellery before jumping to conclusions about the Merkel-Johnson phone call on Tuesday morning.", "description": "\u2018At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\u2019 said the European Council president.", "authors": ["David M.
