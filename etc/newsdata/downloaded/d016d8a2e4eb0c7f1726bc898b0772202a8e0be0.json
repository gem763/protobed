First, it comes from Jonathan Turley, more known as a liberal voice in politics. And second, the reference to The Caine Mutiny has more nuance to it than it first seems.\n\nTurley writes that the former FBI director has become lost in his own self-made mythology:\n\nTwo years ago, former FBI Director James Comey came out with a book that celebrated himself as a paragon of \u201cethical leadership,\u201d a subject that he later taught at the College of William and Mary. Comey declared, \u201cEthical leaders lead by seeing above the short term, above the urgent or the partisan, and with a higher loyalty to lasting values, most importantly the truth.\u201d If that is the case, the new Justice Department inspector general report released on Thursday establishes that Comey is the very antithesis of the ethical leader he described. Comey was found to have violated both federal law and regulations for his own gain, and he made critical decisions that put personal over institutional interests. Nevertheless, Comey released a statement portraying the scathing report as a type of victory and encouraged his critics to send their apologies to him. It was a \u201cCaptain Queeg\u201d moment when myth borders on madness. Rather than rave about who stole his strawberries, as Queeg did in \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d Comey claims someone stole a reputation that he tossed away two years ago. \u2026 Of course, facts are largely immaterial in matters of mythology. When Comey removed FBI material and arranged for a leak to the media, the coverage stayed positive despite some of us noting that the \u201cmemos\u201d removed by Comey were FBI material and potentially classified. At a minimum, he violated clear rules against leaking such information to the media, a curious decision for the person tasked previously with finding leakers. I noted that such leaks were entirely unnecessary, given other options for getting this information to investigators and to Congress.\n\nComey\u2019s self-made mythology reached its apotheosis yesterday, Turley argues:\n\nComey knows that, ultimately for him, none of this matters. He has magnanimously accepted the apologies that no one has offered and claimed vindication that appears nowhere in the inspector general report. That is simply the benefit of being the author of your own mythology.\n\nComey may have built his own mythology, but as Turley also notes, he got plenty of assistance from the national media in amplifying it. Despite obvious issues from the very start about Comey\u2019s actions, media outlets more interested in attacking Donald Trump than in reporting the news helped fix the halo over Comey\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cComey was building a personal brand,\u201d Turley writes, even though his rush to get a self-promoting book about leadership into print should have prompted media outlets to at least consider its inappropriateness for someone who had just left a key law enforcement position. After all, it had just been a year or so after leaders of both parties had demanded Comey\u2019s head for politicizing FBI investigations. Instead of taking a skeptical and objective approach to Comey\u2019s book and self-promotion, Turley recalls that the media \u201cmet [him] with palm fronds and cries of \u2018hosanna\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s Wall Street Journal, Kim Strassel also takes the media to task over its love affair with \u201csneaky, leaky\u201d Comey in light of Horowitz\u2019 findings:\n\nFor more than two years, we\u2019ve heard Mr. Comey\u2019s characterization of his actions, popularized by an adoring media: He felt compelled to memorialize his private discussions with the president, to protect the FBI. He had no choice but to use an intermediary to leak memo contents, to save the nation by forcing the appointment of a special counsel. He was entitled to do so because the memos were his personal papers, and by that time he was a \u201cprivate citizen.\u201d The inspector general calmly and coolly dismantles these claims. \u2026 Mr. Comey clearly detested Mr. Trump from the start. He abused his power and used leaky, sneaky tricks to undermine the presidency. Mr. Comey told the inspector general he had to do it because it was important to \u201cthe Nation,\u201d and \u201cI love this country.\u201d Mr. Horowitz has no time for such self-justification: \u201cComey\u2019s own, personal conception of what was necessary was not an appropriate basis for ignoring the policies and agreements governing the use of FBI records.\u201d The report points out that if every FBI official acted on \u201cpersonal convictions,\u201d the bureau \u201cwould be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly.\u201d This is the real merit of the inspector general\u2019s report\u2014its clear, ringing reminder that the rules apply to all. Still, it should disturb Americans that a man who has now been repeatedly admonished for \u201cacting unilaterally\u201d\u2014and who so dishonestly spins his actions and history\u2014held positions of such power for so long.\n\nTo extend the Caine Mutiny reference, Comey may well have been Captain Queeg with the strawberries, as in the first clip below from the classic film. But if that\u2019s the case, then the second clip captures the role of the national media and the promotion of Comey\u2019s mythology in the character of Keefer.
