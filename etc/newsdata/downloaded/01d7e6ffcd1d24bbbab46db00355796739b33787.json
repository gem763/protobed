(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)\n\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Some criticized New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Tuesday for using a racial slur for African Americans while discussing historical discrimination toward darker-skinned Italian immigrants.\n\nThe Democrat used the slur in an interview on WAMC radio while speaking about Columbus Day and a recent New York Times article about how Italians overcame bigotry in the U.S.\n\nThe governor made his comments as he criticized Italian stereotypes and called for African American, Jewish and Italian communities to stick up for one another when one group faces bigotry.\n\nCuomo seemed to realize the word might bother people. He said \"pardon my language\" before he used the N-word followed by a derogatory slur once commonly lobbed against Italians.\n\nCuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi said the governor was using language that was printed in the Times, and prefaced his remark by saying he was quoting the newspaper.\n\nDemocratic Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who is black, said he didn't take any offense at Cuomo's comments.\n\nBut Bertha Lewis, founder and president of the Black Institute, a public policy think tank, said Cuomo appears to think he has so much privilege he can say anything.\n\n\"He ought to get over himself,\" she said.\n\nWorking Families Party National Director Maurice Mitchell called on Cuomo to apologize and no white person should use the word for any reason. \"That word is a stain on this country's soul,\" he said.", "description": "Some criticized New York Gov.
