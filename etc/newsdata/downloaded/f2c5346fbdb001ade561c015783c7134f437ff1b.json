They will see it as a victory and the abuse will not stop.\n\nTheir team were being humiliated by a brilliant England performance, so why would it make any difference to them if the game is abandoned? It\u2019s no skin off their nose.\n\nEngland's game against Bulgaria was halted during the first half of their contest in Sofia\n\nThe authorities and the police should have just identified the perpetrators and kicked them out. If it\u2019s a whole stand then so be it. For me, walking off just lets the racists win.\n\nThe issues we saw on Monday night come about because of the paltry fines handed out by UEFA, such as with Montenegro in March when England again faced this vile abuse.\n\nFederations are not affected by the fines, so the solution would be to have stadium bans. That way, the genuine fans \u2014 the fans who turn up to support their team \u2014 will be angry and turn on the culprits.\n\nYou could hear after the third goal that the chanting got worse and worse and worse. The Bulgarian fans had realised they had no chance of winning the game so why would they mind if the referee abandoned the match and England got a 3-0 win? They have to have a hard-line approach in the stadium \u2014 kick fans out and if the police have to be heavy-handed then so be it.\n\nSome Three Lions players were subjected to racist abuse from the stands by Bulgarian ultras\n\nUEFA now must take a hard line approach to combat racist abuse by moronic supporters\n\nOtherwise, from the point of view of those chanting abuse, it\u2019s some sort of petty victory to see the players walk off.\n\nOn the pitch it was a complete mismatch, with England in a completely different stratosphere. Gareth Southgate had asked for a reaction after Friday\u2019s 2-1 defeat in the Czech Republic and he got it. It was difficult because Bulgaria are an ageing side and without a win in the group, but nobody got near Harry Winks who dictated play throughout. Ross Barkley was making runs, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford were dangerous and there was plenty of link-up play with Harry Kane.\n\nBulgaria used to produce so many great players but they\u2019re a shadow of that now.\n\nThat said, you have to credit England for the way they played.\n\nA particular mention goes to Tyrone Mings who was on his international debut but barely broke sweat in a dominant display at the back.", "description": "CHRIS SUTTON: I know there's a protocol in place that has to be followed, but if you walk off then you give these morons a voice.
