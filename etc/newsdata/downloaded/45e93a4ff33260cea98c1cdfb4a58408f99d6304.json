Serious injuries in those attacks also jumped, from 2 to 2.5.\n\nInmate assaults against staff jumped to 12.6 for every 1,000 detainees, up from 9.2 in 2018.\n\nUse of force by correction officers against prisoners jumped nearly 30 percent, from 5,175 incidents in 2018 to 6,670 in the most recent fiscal year, which ended in July.\n\nOfficers also used force more often against adolescent inmates \u2014 571 times, up from 478 the year before.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio, who embraced the idea of closing Rikers after years of protests about brutal conditions there, is now pushing a plan to open four new jails to replace the problem-plagued complex.\n\nThe plan, now being considered by the City Council, would put new jails in each borough except Staten Island. The proposal has faced pushback from locals who object to the locations of the jails or think the buildings will be too tall. Meanwhile, activists on the left have opposed the plan on the grounds that the city should not be building new jails at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another exclamation point on the urgency of closing Rikers Island. The violence at Rikers has continued almost unabated for decades across multiple mayoral administrations and multiple commissioners,\u201d said City Council Member Rory Lancman (D-Queens) Tuesday. \u201cAt some point, people have to accept that the Rikers Island model is broken and we need a new model.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety is our top priority, and as the jail population continues to fall, we are now managing a population of people charged with more serious offenses,\u201d said Department of Correction spokesperson Jason Kersten, adding that serious injuries to staff and prisoners had fallen and more officers are wearing body cameras. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for unnecessary and excessive use of force.\u201d", "description": "Mayor Bill de Blasio is now pushing a plan to open four new jails to replace the problem-plagued complex.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/35/0e2a02d04807a16d7fea70ba3899/rikers-ap-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
