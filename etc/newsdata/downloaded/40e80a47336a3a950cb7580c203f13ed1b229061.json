Biden\u2019s plan offers a buy-in option, and would automatically enroll Americans under 138 percent of the poverty line.\n\nCastro quickly followed up with a stinging attack: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d, making the case that Biden\u2019s health care plan is not universal. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\nIt all started on familiar territory. Thursday began like the last two debates \u2014 with an extended debate on health care. Should the country move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system, as advocated for by candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, or focus on more incremental changes to the Affordable Care Act, as Biden is advocating for?\n\nBut it ended in a jab into what has been a growing narrative around Biden\u2019s gaffes and slip ups on the campaign trail.\n\nCastro called out Biden for changing his plan on the debate stage\n\nCastro jumped into the opening conversation about health care to point out that Biden\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t cover everyone. Biden\u2019s plan is explicit about this: \u201cHe\u2019ll also build on the Affordable Care Act with a plan to insure more than an estimated 97% of Americans,\u201d the plan says. Three percent of the American population is roughly 10 million people.\n\n\u201cI know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered,\u201d Castro said of Biden\u2019s plan. \u201cNow, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn\u2019t true and Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that, they said that was true.\u201d\n\nCastro continued:\n\n\u201cThe differences between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in, they would automatically be enrolled. That\u2019s a big difference, because Barack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\u201d\n\nBiden immediately jumped at Castro\u2019s comment.\n\n\u201cThey do not have to buy in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are automatically enrolled.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the fight escalated. Here\u2019s the whole exchange:\n\nCastro: You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that. Biden: I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money. Castro: We need a health care system. Biden: You are automatically enrolled. Castro: Automatically enrolls people regardless if they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That is a big difference. I\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not. Biden: That will be a surprise to him.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Biden did say that his plan allows people who lose their employer-based insurance to have the option to buy-in to the public plan.\n\n\u201cThe option I\u2019m proposing is, Medicare for Choice,\u201d Biden said on the debate stage just minutes before Castro jumped in. \u201cIf you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance company, from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don\u2019t have no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered. Period.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what his plan says too. \u201dThe Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare,\u201d the plan says. His proposal would still significantly push the current health care system to the left by establishing a public option and aggressively tackling drug prices. Biden\u2019s plan said this public option will reduce costs by \u201cnegotiating lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers\u201d \u2014 essentially using the same bargaining power that Medicare currently has. But it is not universal.\n\nBut Biden also said that \u201canyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have,\u201d as his plan proposes.\n\nCastro, meanwhile has supported Medicare-for-all, which would move everyone on to a single government-run program, essentially eliminating private insurance and guaranteeing all Americans health insurance. Though, Castro supports carving out some role from private insurance. His plan allows for certain supplementary private insurance or for people to opt-out of Medicare if they have a \u201chigh-standard\u201d and regulated private insurance plan through work.\n\nBiden\u2019s comments \u2014 that people are automatically enrolled \u2014 is only true for people below 138 percent of the poverty level. But nevertheless, Castro took it one step further, surfacing what has been a growing narrative around Biden\u2019s age.\n\nBiden\u2019s has had to answer for his age\n\nOn the campaign trail Biden, who is 76, has repeatedly talked himself into news cycles about his gaffes and slip ups. Biden\u2019s campaign chalks it up to a press hungry for a juicy headline. Biden himself has attributed the coverage of his gaffes to his frontrunner status; he has held a comfortable lead in early polls ever since jumping into the race, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nThat said, his campaign has acknowledged the narrative; the campaign tweeted a video in which an Iowa voter told Biden that his \u201cfiery\u201d speech quelled any initial concerns she had about his age.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear, I\u2019m not going nuts,\u201d he told reporters, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether it was the medical school or where the hell I spoke. But it was on the campus.\u201d\n\nOn some level, this is nothing new for Biden, who has a history of slipping up and saying things that are slightly off or need clarification. Biden\u2019s competitors in the Democratic primary have used those remarks against him, like when Harris attacked Biden\u2019s comments about working with Southern segregationist Democrats on busing policies in the 1970s.\n\nCastro made the attack more explicit, asking the former vice president directly if he was \u201cforgetting\u201d his own words. The nature of that line was acknowledged on the stage.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scores points against each other. Poking at each other.\u201d\n\nCastro had a response for Buttigieg too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election. That\u2019s an election. You know? This is what we\u2019re here for. It\u2019s an election.\u201d\n\nUpdate: We have added additional comments Biden made during the debate as well as some context on Biden\u2019s health care plan.", "description": "Biden contradicted what his proposal would do.
