Some pro-China lawmakers in Hong Kong also called on Wednesday for a ban on wearing masks at public gatherings, a move aimed at stopping protesters from hiding their identity from police officers.\n\nWaves of rallies across the former British colony led to widespread clashes between protesters and police, with an officer shooting and wounding a demonstrator for the first time since unrest began almost four months ago. On Thursday, Hong Kong police charged the shot protester -- who is expected to live -- with rioting and assaulting an officer. Footage shows the man swinging some sort of pipe or rod at the officer who fired his gun.\n\nMore protests are planned over the weekend in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIn the face of such a massive series of rioting incidents, we cannot work alone without appropriate measures and support from the top level,\u201d Junior Police Officers\u2019 Association chairman Lam Chi-wai said in a statement.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s powerful Public Order Ordinance -- passed during a wave of leftist riots in 1967 -- lets the government establish curfews and close areas from public access. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance of 1922 goes further, allowing the chief executive to make \u201cany regulations whatsoever\u201d to ensure public security, including censorship, snap arrests and property searches and seizures.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong and Chinese governments haven\u2019t ruled out the use of such emergency powers, they\u2019ve so far refrained from accessing them. The U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which reports to the president and Congress, has warned Lam\u2019s government that the \u201cEmergency Regulations Ordinance or taking steps toward martial law in #HongKong is the wrong way to resolve the situation.\u201d\n\nThe measures risk further inflaming public anger over what they see as eroding freedoms and dealing another blow to the city\u2019s battered economy.\n\nThe Emergency Regulations Ordinance hasn\u2019t been used in more than a half century. The government has also considered other steps, such as a law banning the wearing of face masks.\n\nProtesters returned to the streets Wednesday to vent frustration over the shooting of an 18-year-old demonstrator a day earlier, occupying public spaces and vandalizing train stations and mainland-linked businesses. The injured protester, who was shot in the chest during a scuffle with riot police, is expected to survive.\n\nThe incident drew criticism from U.S. lawmakers, who are considering legislation that could establish a high-profile annual review process for Hong Kong\u2019s special trading status. The Hong Kong branch of China\u2019s foreign ministry hit back at the legislators, saying police \u201cwere forced to fire at the attackers to save themselves and their colleagues.\u201d\n\n(Updates with protester charged in third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Daniel Ten Kate\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong police groups are urging the city to impose curfews and invoke other powers under a controversial colonial era-emergency law, as Chief Executive Carrie Lam struggles to control escalating unrest.Associations representing front-line officers and inspectors called on the government", "authors": ["Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jTo7QSytwYL8IQOcxPCjlg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/617b5b7a7a59244455baf2b390429c98"}
