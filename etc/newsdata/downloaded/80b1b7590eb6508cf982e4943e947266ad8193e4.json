Maybe his next article will be about how life is for the homeless on the streets of S.F, Portland Oregon, the Bay Area where thousands live on the streets without jobs, shelter, fear of being robbed, no running water, no medical assistance, no restrooms, and yet these people are stepped over each day by the citizens living in CA. as if they don't exist. I'm more interested in finding out from these homeless in depth how they got this way, and what can be done to help them first before the these authors and media publish anymore hardships on illegal immigrants or asylum seekers. The American homeless should be the first and only priority for the U.S. to address before spending taxpayers dollars on non American citizens.", "description": "Feby goes off on Jackie at dinner in Costa Rica!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dldz1U3ACOmzrBZpK7OK1Q--~B/aD0yNDA7dz0zMjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.internetvideoarchive.com/8e59c30c2c639bcae613fd95dd26c8b5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
