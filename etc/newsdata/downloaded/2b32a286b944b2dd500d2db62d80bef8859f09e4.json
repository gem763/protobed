(Screengrab, video supplied)\n\nA video posted on Tuesday shows how a man was escorted out of the University of Stellenbosch library after apparently masturbating under a study desk.\n\nThe short footage, posted by a Stellenbosch student, shows the man sitting with papers spread on the desk in front of him and his right hand moving under the furniture.\n\nAnother clip shows the man with his hands behind his back, being escorted out of the library by what appear to be campus security guards.\n\nWestern Cape police said that no case of public indecency had yet been registered with Stellenbosch police.\n\nThe Anti-Gender Based Violence Movement of Stellenbosch, a collective of university students and staff, condemned the incident.\n\n\"This act of public indecency and harassment has occurred more than once this year, and needs to be condemned by all members of society,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"We call on the university and law enforcement to investigate this heinous act. We request that the university and campus security provide us with more clarity and context for transparency.\"\n\nNews24 understands that the university's student affairs department has received numerous emails from concerned students.\n\nThe university has acknowledged a request for comment and said it was working on a statement.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\n- Compiled by Jenna Etheridge", "description": "A video posted on social media shows a man being escorted out of the University of Stellenbosch library after seemingly masturbating under a study desk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9537/e233e0300238491abf200450e90627d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
