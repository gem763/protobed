Mr. Netanyahu didn\u2019t explicitly rule out a broad unity government but said he would only be part of a coalition that was headed by him and excluded Arab parties.\n\n\u201cThis time more than ever before, especially with all the security and political situations that we face, it is forbidden that such a government be formed with anti-Zionist parties, with the Arab parties,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\nWhile he appeared defiant on television, his decision to scrap a trip to the United Nations General Assembly next week, a favorite forum for the prime minister, signaled that his political luck was waning. He had planned to meet President Trump and hasn\u2019t missed the international confab since 2010.\n\n\u201cPolitically, we still don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to end up, but he\u2019s not in a good place,\u201d said Reuven Hazan, a political-science professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\nIn unofficial results from Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Channel 11, Mr. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party received enough votes for 32 seats in the 120-seat parliament, compared with 31 for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party. Mr. Gantz\u2019s bloc of centrist, left-wing and Arab parties would get 56 seats to 55 for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s alliance of right-wing and religious parties.\n\nOfficials from Israel\u2019s central election committee said the results would take longer to tally than in previous elections owing to new procedures introduced to protect against fraud and miscounts. Analysts said final results could come midday Thursday.\n\nIf those margins hold as votes continued to be counted Wednesday, Mr. Gantz, a former general who formed a new political party to dethrone Mr. Netanyahu, could be the first to get a chance to form a coalition government.\n\n\u201cWe wish for the people of Israel a good and satisfactory unity government,\u201d Mr. Gantz told reporters this morning as he left his home in Rosh Haayin.\n\nThe results appeared to make both men dependent on Yisrael Beiteinu chief Avigdor Lieberman, who isn\u2019t committed to either side and campaigned for a unity government combining his party, Blue and White and Likud. Mr. Lieberman declined to join Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition after an election earlier this year, complaining about the prime minister\u2019s reliance on religious parties to stay in power and prompting Mr. Netanyahu to call for a second vote.\n\nThe gambit appeared to have backfired for Mr. Netanyahu and to have rewarded Mr. Lieberman, who is now Israel\u2019s kingmaker. President Reuven Rivlin will decide in the next few days whether Mr. Gantz or Mr. Netanyahu will get the first chance to form a coalition, after talking to Mr. Lieberman and leaders of other parties.\n\nThe early results reflected voters\u2019 growing frustration with Mr. Netanyahu. The prime minister appeared to lose a key part of his base: secular, right-wing voters who were tired of his dependence on Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox parties. And he appeared to have galvanized Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, who turned out in higher numbers for a unified group of Arab parties that mobilized voters around what they said were Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to intimidate them.\n\nThe possible bribery and fraud charges that Mr. Netanyahu faces pose a serious threat to his political and personal future. The charges, which Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed as a witch hunt, relate to allegations that he tried to influence media coverage of himself and his family, along with accepting gifts from two billionaire businessmen in return for favors.\n\nIf Mr. Netanyahu can\u2019t find a way to remain prime minister, he faces the prospect of a forced resignation if he is indicted following a pretrial hearing next month. His allies have previously floated proposals to pass a law giving him immunity from charges, but those efforts faltered last spring when he failed to form a government after winning April\u2019s elections and called a new vote.\n\n\u201cHe looks pretty much cornered at this point,\u201d said Emmanuel Navon, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum.\n\nThe uncertainty comes at a turbulent time in the Middle East, with tensions rising between Washington and Tehran as the U.S. weighs a military response after accusing Tehran of attacking Saudi oil facilities. Mr. Netanyahu has been a close ally of President Trump in his efforts to pressure Iran.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s central role in Israeli politics isn\u2019t over. His reputation for outmaneuvering political opponents and preserving his hold on power as Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister earned him the nickname \u201cthe magician.\u201d\n\nFor now, Likud officials say they are sticking with Mr. Netanyahu, giving him a large political base of support. Likud has pressured Mr. Gantz and his Blue and White party to form a unity government with Mr. Netanyahu as the head of the party.\n\nMr. Netanyahu could also try to persuade political parties such as Mr. Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu or the Labor party to abandon their campaign promises and sit with him.\n\nBut both Mr. Lieberman and Labor seemed unwilling to do that on Wednesday, potentially looking instead to the potential for fresh leadership in Israel for the first time in a decade, with a new crop of leaders promising a less divisive politics.\n\n\u2014Dov Lieber contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to press ahead with forming a government a day after he appeared to fall short of a parliamentary majority and a party led by his rival edged ahead in votes.", "authors": ["Felicia Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108149/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
