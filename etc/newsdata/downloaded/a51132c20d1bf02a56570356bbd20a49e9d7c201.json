TSN, +1.29% , Kellogg Co. K, -0.43% , Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, +0.39% , Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, -0.88% and Kroger Co. KR, -2.01% just some of the big names that are making inroads into the plant-based meat alternative category.\n\nBut Sundaram says Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are currently leading the charge thanks to partnerships with fast-food players like Burger King, which has the Impossible Whopper, Del Taco Restaurants Inc. \\ TACO, -1.36% , Dunkin Brands Group Inc. DNKN, -0.60% , and a host of other chains.\n\nBurger King is part of the Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, -0.42% portfolio.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s how Beyond Meat can lose the lead in the plant-based meat category to Tyson\n\n\u201cWe think the size of the U.S. alternative meats market could grow to about $100 billion by 2030, driven by the growing awareness of climate change, natural resource constraints and the health risks associated with red meat consumption,\u201d wrote CFRA in a previous note. \u201cFor comparison purposes, the U.S. meat market is currently about $270 billion in market size.\u201d\n\nBeyond Meat BYND, -6.27% shares have risen sharply from the $25 IPO price to more than $111 on Friday. However, the stock has dropped 34.4% over the past three months. It began trading on May 2.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, -0.39% is down 0.5% for the last three months.\n\n\u201c[A]rguably the number one reason for investors not to buy Beyond Meat shares at this time is the fact that Beyond Meat\u2019s lockup period expires on Oct. 29,\u201d CFRA said. \u201cOn this date up to 48 million shares, or about 80% of the shares outstanding, many be eligible to be freely traded in the public market. Given the dramatic appreciation since the IPO, we expect many insiders and private-equity funds to cash out, putting further downward pressure on the stock.\u201d\n\nSee: KFC is selling meatless friend chicken -- is it actually healthier than the real thing?\n\nDow Jones Market Data Group\n\nStill, Sundaram expects Beyond Meat revenue to approach $4 billion by 2030, with most of that in the U.S. Beyond Meat is also expected to have about 10% of the market by 2030.\n\nMKM Partners highlight in a recent note that the plant-based meat category is shifting as consumer demand, product pricing, and capacity for producing merchandise still sort themselves out.\n\n\u201cWhile the growth of the industry is one unknown factor, we are also starting to hear increased chatter around the potential health benefits/questions around the different product assortments, which is worth paying attention to,\u201d MKM wrote.\n\nAnalysts note the entrance of another major name as well: McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, +0.80% , on a pilot basis.\n\nAnd: Beyond Meat\u2019s stock soars after McDonald\u2019s unveils test of company-made P.L.T. burgers\n\n\u201cAt this stage, this is bigger news for Beyond Meat than McDonald\u2019s, but demonstrates the willingness of restaurant concepts to add plant-based products and bodes well for longer-term availability,\u201d wrote Cowen analysts in a recent report.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: \u2018Totally bizarre!\u2019 -- nutritionists see red over study playing down the health risks of red meat\n\nCowen credits Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods for \u201creinventing\u201d the veggie burger with their meat-mimicking taste and sustainability messaging. And CFRA notes that these two brands have \u201crevolutionized this category by tailoring products to flexitarians,\u201d those who eat both animal protein and the plant-based alternatives.\n\nBut Sundaram also says that these alternatives seem \u201cmore like a discretionary item\u201d because of the premium pricing compared with \u201cregular meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such we think the alternative meat industry could fact high volatility during an economic slowdown,\u201d he said.\n\nMoreover, when compared with the plant-based milk category, which \u201ccould grow to the entire size of the current dairy milk industry\u201d alternative meats will never overtake the size of the animal meat industry \u201csince there are cuts of red meat that may never be substituted with a plant-based option.\u201d", "description": "Beyond Meat Inc. was initiated at sell with a $120 price target at CFRA, with analyst Arun Sundaram saying the plant-based meat company will be overtaken by...", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL203_beyond_ZG_20190611125941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
