He also demanded a secular \"liberal\" government shorn of the religious and ultra-Orthodox allies the prime minister has long relied upon. \"The conclusion is clear, everything we said throughout the campaign is coming true,\" he said outside his home in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim. \"There is one and only option: a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option.\"\n\nMr Gantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Likud party led by Mr Netanyahu at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks. It raised the specter of an alternate Likud candidate rising to challenge Mr Netanyahu, though most of its senior officials have thus far pledged to stand solidly behind their leader. Mr Netanyahu's Likud party and Mr Gantz's Blue and White both had 32 seats each of the parliament's 120, with more than 90 per cent of votes counted, Israeli media is reporting. Advertisement Mr Netanyahu's main challenger, centrist Benny Gantz, said it appeared from the exit polls Israel's longest-serving leader was defeated, but only official results would tell. Mr Gantz, a former armed forces chief, beamed with confidence as he told a rally of his Blue and White Party it appeared \"we fulfilled our mission\", and he pledged to work towards formation of a unity government. Mr Netanyahu, he said, apparently \"did not succeed in his mission\" to win a fifth term. \"We will await the actual results,\" Mr Gantz, 60, said. Here is some analysis of the exit polls and the election so far from Bel Trew, our correspondent in Tel Aviv: Netanyahu suffers devastating blow after hard-right coalition fails to win majority, exit polls show None of the polls found that his right-wing bloc would be able to secure the 61-seat majority needed to form a government Israel's two main political parties were deadlocked on Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election.
