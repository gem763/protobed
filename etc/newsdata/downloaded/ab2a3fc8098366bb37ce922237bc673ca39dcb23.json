The new Stick Up Cam is sold in wired, battery-powered, or solar-powered versions. It also has 1080p video, motion detection, and night vision like the previous version, but Amazon says this year\u2019s Stick Up Cam is 30 percent cheaper at $99. Amazon says it\u2019s available to preorder today and will ship on October 23rd. It also announced a $199 Ring Stick Up Cam Elite, which is powered over Ethernet for a more reliable connection, but there\u2019s no release date for it yet.\n\nThe Ring Indoor Cam is a new, smaller, and cheaper version of the Stick Up Cam. It\u2019s intended to only be used indoors, and is only offered in a wired version, so it\u2019s cheaper at $59.99. Amazon says this is available to order today.\n\nAmazon also showed a video demonstrating an upcoming feature where Alexa can \u201canswer\u201d your door and have a conversation with the person on your doorstep through a Ring doorbell. Amazon says this feature will roll out to Ring Doorbell Elites next year.\n\nAmazon also announced the Retrofit Alarm Kit, which you can plug into an existing home alarm system and use it with Ring. Amazon says it will cost $199, and can come bundled with a Ring Alarm Hub for $375.", "description": "At its fall event today, Amazon announced two new versions of its Ring Stick Up security cameras: a refreshed Stick Up Camera and a new indoor Stick Up Cam, a smaller version that\u2019s intended to be used indoors.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Sep", "Amazon Also Announced The Retrofit Alarm Kit", "Which You Can Plug Into An Existing Home Alarm System", "Use It With Ring.
