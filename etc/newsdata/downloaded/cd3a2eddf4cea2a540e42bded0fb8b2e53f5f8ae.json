Behind them is a dead man hanging from a tree and a terrified woman being held against her will with a halter around her neck.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1862.

This is a very unusual painting.\u201d\n\nThe work was one of seven medieval-inspired watercolours bought by Rossetti\u2019s friend William Morris in the late 1850s.\n\nMorris later sold them, and five finally ended up in the Tate collection. Those watercolours \u2013 romantic visions of a chivalric world such as The Blue Closet and The Tune of the Seven Towers \u2013 are much more what you would expect a Rossetti to be.\n\nProbably because it was so different and jarring, The Death of St Breuze went its own separate way. It is recorded as part of an auction in New York in 1926 and was then essentially lost to the art world \u2013 there were no photographs of it \u2013 until it appeared at auction in London in 1993.\n\nIt is a fascinating painting because it is so different. A rare description of it is in an 1899 book by HC Marillier, who called it \u201cone of the crudest and least successful of all Rossetti\u2019s water-colours\u201d.\n\nThe grim scene, he continued had a \u201crepulsive and unpleasant effect\u201d and the composition was \u201cgrotesque and strained\u201d.\n\nIt is also mentioned by Rossetti\u2019s brother William in a biography of the artist published in 1889. He writes that Rossetti found The Death of Breuze \u201ca \u2018tough job,\u2019 and opined that it ought to have been managed with less labour\u201d.\n\nWalker said it was not straightforward to make out what was going on. \u201cIt is an image you really have to stand back from in order to decipher the action. It is not immediate and it is not what you expect from Rossetti, but it is an object which really grows on you.\u201d\n\nThe work is one of 900 objects in the collection of Christian, a leading authority on Victorian art who championed the pre-Raphaelites in the 1960s and 1970s when they were out of fashion and their stock was low.\n\nHe is particularly known for curating an important Edward Burne-Jones exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in 1976 and a show called The Last Romantics at the Barbican in 1989.\n\nThe Rossetti will be part of a small display at the museum, opening on Tuesday, showing highlights of the collection, including drawings by Charles Haslewood Shannon, Benjamin Robert Haydon, Dorothy Hawksley and Kalman Kemeny.\n\nWalker said: \u201cIt is a major acquisition offering a huge insight into Victorian art and is a real treasure trove for anyone who wants to learn more deeply about printmaking and drawing and honing the craft of drawing.\u201d", "description": "The dark Death of Breuze Sans Piti\u00e9 is from the collection of the late art historian John Christian", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740415ca76812da0edc7d39ab9291965916ee61e/0_1739_4352_2610/master/4352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab83fe896ef42eb32adc5877707bfc6d"}
