Afterward, when the Dead played the Worcester Centrum, Walton and his teammates returned the favor and went to the show in a caravan of limos after meeting at Larry Bird\u2019s house, except for Danny Ainge, whose wife wouldn\u2019t let him go.\n\nAsked about the show years later, Bird called guitarist Jerry Garcia \u201cthe Michael Jordan of musicians.\u201d\n\nThough he was born too late to catch Garcia, Detroit Lions defensive end Romeo Okwara is the latest link in the unbroken chain between pro athletes and the Dead.\n\nNow in his fourth year in the league, the 24-year-old first heard about the Dead when one of his business professors at Notre Dame came into class \u201cfreaking out\u201d about the announcement of the \u201cFare Thee Well\u201d tour (the last run to feature original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann all playing together).\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never heard of them at the time actually,\u201d Okwara tells InsideHook. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about how he\u2019s a Deadhead and he went to all these shows when he was younger and they\u2019re having this last tour and it\u2019s this big deal. It\u2019s holding up the class.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s mainly just the energy and the feeling of being alive I would say, which the music certainly brings out of me.\n\nCurious, the Charlotte native gave the band a listen after class and liked what he heard enough to go check them out a few years later at an Alpine Valley show.\n\n\u201cI had to experience what everyone was talking about and I think I felt that same feeling,\u201d Okwara says. \u201cI think the scene was unlike any other musical experience you could have. Just showing up to a parking lot and seeing all these characters all having a good time together. Everyone was just so happy and just very welcoming. I enjoyed the community aspect \u2014 everyone was free and open and very accepting of each other and the music was beautiful. I went and just danced all night.\u201d\n\nSince Alpine Valley, Okwara has gone to about 15 shows and amassed a pretty decent collection of tie-dye Dead shirts in his closet. Last summer alone he hit up shows in Chicago, New York and Boulder, and got to spend time backstage with members of the band, including John Mayer and Weir.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult for him to go to shows during the NFL season, Okwara stays connected with the Dead by listening to them before games and posting about them on social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always bumping to it in my headphones wherever I am,\u201d Okwara says. \u201cI get pumped up when I listen. I don\u2019t need to get in \u2018go kill someone\u2019 mode.\n\nIt\u2019s mainly just the energy and the feeling of being alive I would say, which the music certainly brings out of me.\u201d\n\nAnnoying question about a band that\u2019s played more than 2,000 songs live over more than five decades of touring, but does he have a favorite song?\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of songs I could say,\u201d Okwara says. \u201cFor my favorite, I would say probably \u2018Help On The Way\u2019 [then] \u2018Slipknot.\u2019 I mean, I kind of love a lot of them, but I would say those are probably the main ones.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to hear the Dead playing in the Lions\u2019 locker room. \u201cI did probably once, but I don\u2019t think I ever had anyone notice,\u201d Okwara says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely friends with a couple of teammates that listen to the Grateful Dead, but I don\u2019t think I know any others that have been to shows.\u201d\n\nAnd being into the Dead isn\u2019t the only interest Okwara has that sets him apart from many of his counterparts in the NFL.\n\nRomeo Okwara\u2019s photography skills in action. (Michael Rothstein)\n\nOkwara, who broke into the the league with the New York Giants after signing with the club as an undrafted free agent in 2016, is an aspiring photographer who currently has his first-ever exhibit on display at the Leica Store SoHo in New York City.\n\nTitled \u201cRescue 2: Before The Call\u201d and on display through November 3, the gallery showcases images of the firemen and women of the Rescue Company 2 Firehouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.\n\nOkwara first got interested in photography when he was a senior at Notre Dame while taking photos and videos of friends but began taking it more seriously during his first season with the Giants.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to New York my rookie year, I bought a Leica M6 and some film and everything kind of changed from there,\u201d he says. \u201cI kind of saw photography in a different light. It became more artistic and I started focusing a lot more on different skills within photography and it became fun capturing pictures that way. I like taking pictures of people. I connected and interacted with people whether it was on the street or just trying to take a portrait of them. I think people are generally my favorite subject.\u201d\n\nAn image from \u201cRescue 2: Before The Call.\u201d (Romeo Okwara)\n\nThe genesis of \u201cRescue 2: Before The Call\u201d came about when a couple of the firefighters from Rescue 2 visited the Giants and talked to the team about the history of the firehouse and their role as a rescue team covering all of Brooklyn.\n\nIntrigued, Okwara visited Rescue 2\u2019s firehouse during an off-day and hung out with the squad for an afternoon in Bed-Stuy.\n\n\u201cJust being in the building, there was definitely something special I sensed while I was there,\u201d Okwara says. \u201cAfter hearing different stories about the history, seeing the different pictures on the wall and seeing how humble this building had been in the early 1900s, I really wanted to just document the building for them and capture it. Especially since they were moving to a new building and didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to the old one. I wanted to create something to kind of hold that space visually for them with pictures.\u201d\n\nReturning to the firehouse a second time, Okwara was able to photograph what he felt was \u201cthe moments before the call.\u201d\n\nAn image from \u201cRescue 2: Before The Call.\u201d (Romeo Okwara)\n\nThe team at Rescue 2 were great subjects for Okwara to capture for his first-ever exhibit, there\u2019s one subject who alludes him and always will: Garcia.\n\n\u201cWish I could go back in time to \u201995 but I was just out of the womb,\u201d he says.", "description": "Okwara first heard about the Dead from one of his professors at Notre Dame and now goes to shows whenever he isn't playing defense for the Detroit Lions.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169027314-e1569003865585.jpg?fit=780%2C519", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
