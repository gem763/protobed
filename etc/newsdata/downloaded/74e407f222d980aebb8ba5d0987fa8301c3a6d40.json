It seems that they thought we are a young couple so let's bully them out of the house - and this is not ok.'\n\nEmma said the couple had been looking for a house for a year, and had visited the development several times looking for the 'perfect home'.\n\nShe added: 'We were looking for a home to start a family in, so after a few months of back and forth, we finally decided on a four-bedroom detached house, so reserved the house.'\n\nEmma said the couple are now 'extremely upset and angry', and said she had a panic attack when she heard the news\n\nIn their letter, the couple said the problems included a coal shaft close to the property that they hadn't been given details of, a misspelled name, and that they were overcharged for flooring\n\nThe couple wrote to Bellway chief executive Jason Honeyman asking for a 'gesture of goodwill' in return for the faults\n\nEmma claims that, after being shown the plans, they were told there was a mine shaft close to the house - prompting the couple to ask about the risks involved.\n\nHowever, they say that the issue 'was brushed under the carpet' and they have still have not received the information.\n\nAccording to Emma, her name had been spelled incorrectly in documents, with the deposit amount also allegedly incorrect.\n\nShe also claimed the couple had also been overcharged for flooring, leading them to email the customer care and Mr Honeyman.\n\nThe firm has refunded the overpayment, she said - but 'no other part of our complaint was addressed'.\n\nThen, last week, a letter addressed from the firm's North West managing director David Williams to Emma, said he was 'very sorry' the couple had 'found it necessary to email Mr Honeyman'.\n\nHowever, they were told days later by a regional managing director that nothing in their complaint 'warranted a goodwill gesture'\n\nThe letter added that 'all' of the errors could have been easily rectified, adding that the flooring had indeed been refunded.\n\nIt said: 'We do not believe that any of the issues raised in your email warrant a goodwill gesture from Bellway, and we also feel that due to the nature of your email and how unhappy you seem to be, Bellway is not the builder for you.\n\n'We have therefore instructed our solicitor to request contract documentation back from your solicitor, and the property will be placed back on the open market.'\n\nDescribing the situation as the 'worst customer experience', Emma said: 'I was driving and Jordan rang me to inform me of the news.\n\n'I had a panic attack on the side of the motorway and my parents had to come and get me, I literally cried the whole night as my dream house had just crumbled in front of my eyes.'\n\nEmma said despite the setback, she rang Bellway in an attempt to salvage the deal and spoke to several officials but said she was spoken to 'rudely'.\n\n'I hope nobody else has to go through the stress an upset we have been through,' she added.\n\nA spokesman for Bellway Homes said: 'As an NHBC five star accredited housebuilder, we are incredibly proud of our customer service and feel that it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment on individual customer cases which remain a private matter between ourselves and our customers.'", "description": "Emma Moffatt and partner Jordan Burns were set to move into their new-build home in Huyton, Merseyside but said there had been several issues with builders Bellway.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19439824-0-image-a-54_1570533448148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
