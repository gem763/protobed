It's not like if you say his name everyone has to go trembling asunder,\" Gaetz said, once again defending Trump's phone call and referencing the fictional Harry Potter villain whose name must not be spoken.\n\nThe congressman also reacted to Rep. John Garamandi, D-Calif., who defended Democrats' decision to pursue impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"You know 'pin the tail on the donkey' child's game.
