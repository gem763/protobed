Ankara considers the Kurds terrorists connected an insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nThe United States had been working with Turkey to set up a safe zone along the Syria-Turkey border in order to assuage Turkish concerns about the Kurdish forces. The U.S. military was touting that effort as recently as Saturday.\n\nIn staying in the area, U.S. troops had also effectively been acting as a shield for the Kurds against a Turkish strike.\n\nHoffman said the Defense Department's position \"has been and remains that establishing a safe zone in northern Syria is the best path forward to maintaining stability.\"\n\nHe adds that the military has \"made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time,\" and that U.S. troops were moved \"out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety.\"\n\nA senior administration official also told reporters on Monday that Trump was not giving Turkey a \u201cgreen light\u201d to invade Syria, and that, of the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in the country, about 50 to 100 special operators will be moved to other bases.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has defended his decision by saying that it is time to end U.S. involvement in \"ridiculous Endless Wars,\u201d even as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including many of Trump\u2019s typical Republican allies, have criticized the move as abandoning the Kurds to be attacked by Turkey.\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, Turkey on Monday evening bombed the Syrian-Iraqi border in anticipation of an offensive.\n\nThe administration is set to give congressional staffers a \u201ctop secret\u201d briefing on the Syria announcement later Tuesday afternoon.", "description": "The Pentagon on Tuesday asserted that top defense officials were consulted prior to President Trump's surprise and widely criticized announcement that U.S. troops would leave northeast Syria ahead of a Turkish offensive in the area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ussyriakurds_100619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
