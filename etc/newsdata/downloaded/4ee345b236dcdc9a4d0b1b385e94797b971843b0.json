However, Mr Ross argued that the $US163 billion ($242 billion) in US foreign direct investment stock, 2000 American companies operating locally and their employment of more than 400,000 Australians far outweighed China's economic contribution to Australia.\n\n\"China imports more from Australia than the United States does, but their value-add to the Australian economy \u2013 and to the lives of Australians \u2013 is much more limited than the role and the participation of the US,\" Mr Ross told the US Chamber of Commerce in Australia lunch.\n\nIn comments that implicitly back Mr Morrison's call for outdated world trade rules to be refreshed to recognise China as a \"newly-developed economy\", Mr Ross said China was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001 \"under the theory that it would live up to its obligations\".\n\n\"But there were no effective enforcement mechanisms, and China has refused to change its behaviour,\" he said.\n\n\"China continues to cause massive market dislocations due to overcapacity and dumping excess production onto global markets.\n\n\"We are addressing fundamental issues in our trade relationship with China, including forced technology transfers, cyber intrusions, the stealing of IP, and industrial subsidies to state-owned enterprises.\n\n\"If we can get China to abide by the global rules of trade, every nation in the world will benefit.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican and Chinese officials are locked in a new attempt to revive a trade deal in talks in Washington this week, before tariffs are again scheduled to increase this month.\n\nTensions are heightened after the US Commerce Department on Monday blacklisted 28 Chinese public security bureaux and companies over Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims.\n\nChinese sponsors and partners have cut ties with America's National Basketball Association, which was scheduled to hold an exhibition game in Shanghai, after an American basketball official on social media supported anti-Chinese government protests in Hong Kong.\n\nProseucting the case for deregulation, Mr Ross pointed to the earlier struggles with red tape of Australian-listed miner Rio Tinto which, under previous US governments, had to persevere for 10 years to secure permits to build a huge copper mine in the US state of Arizona.\n\n\"That's a real problem and we're trying to get that down to a two-year period, maybe even a one-year period,\" Mr Ross said.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Ross held talks in Canberra with Resources Minister Matt Canavan about the possibility of the United States helping to develop and fund Australian critical minerals projects to diversify rare earths production away from China.\n\nAustralia and the US are co-ordinating their national strategies on critical minerals, which are used to build defence weapons and emerging technologies crucial to the modern economy.\n\nChina, a US strategic competitor currently engaged in a trade war with Washington, controls at least 80 per cent of global trade in rare earths.\n\nCritical minerals, including rare earths, lithium, copper and cobalt, are a vital part of the defence supply chain, being used in everything from weapons guidance systems to improving the durability of electronics used in the field.\n\nThey are also used in components for wind turbines, electric vehicles, power tools and fridges.", "description": "US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has used a Sydney speech to blast China for inflicting 'massive market dislocations' through predatory international trade and technology theft.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1582%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_38/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/45e7c2eca428dfae946b13eb32554c23afe2b28c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
