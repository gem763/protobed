REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - The South American trade bloc, Mercosur, along with other countries in the region on Sunday, condemned the unrest in Ecuador, saying mass demonstrations against cuts to fuel subsidies were an attempt to destabilize the government of President Len\u00edn Moreno.\n\nThe unrest has been the worst in the small South American country in more than a decade and the latest flashpoint of opposition to the International Monetary Fund in Latin America.\n\n\u201cWe endorse the efforts made by Ecuador\u2019s government to maintain peace, public order and democratic institutions by using the instruments provided by the constitution and the law,\u201d Mercosur members said in a joint statement with a group of countries including Peru, Colombia and Chile.\n\nMercosur groups Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.\n\n\u201cWe condemn acts of violence and attempts to destabilize the country, its institutions and the Ecuadorean democratic process,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMoreno has defended his decision to slash fuel subsidies as a key part of his bid to clean up the country\u2019s finances.\n\nHe denied it was a request made by the IMF, with which Ecuador signed a $4.2 billion deal earlier this year, angering former supporters who voted for him in 2017 as the left-leaning successor of his former ally, Rafael Correa.\n\nBrazilian Foreign minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo said on Twitter on Sunday that leftist forces were responsible for the unrest in Ecuador.\n\n\u201cSouth America is mobilized to defend democracy in Ecuador, where leftist forces are trying to undermine the legitimate president Lenin Moreno.
