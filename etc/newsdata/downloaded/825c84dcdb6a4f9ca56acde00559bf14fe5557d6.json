(Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nFormer Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, now head of Fair Fight 2020 (a group devoted to combating voter suppression) and Fair Count (a group designed to assure an accurate 2020 Census), outshines virtually every other Democrat in her ability to communicate about policies in matter-of-fact tones that do not treat voters as fools nor politics as devoid of values. She is also darn funny. She refers to the 10 days between the 2018 Georgia governor\u2019s election and her announcement acknowledging Brian Kemp as the winner of the race as her \u201cshiva\u201d period. She mourned, she tells audiences. \u201cBut since I\u2019m from the South, it\u2019s 10 days, not seven.\u201d\n\nAfter she enthralled the audience on Thursday at a gathering of NARAL Pro-Choice America, the leading abortion-rights advocacy group, in Washington \u2014 expounding on everything from the impact of lost access to reproductive care for poor and nonwhite women to the necessity of pinning down debate moderators to ask about voting and abortion rights to the necessity of reaching out even to voters who do not like you \u2014 I had the chance to sit down with her.\n\nShe is as sunny, steady and self-assured in person as in public. I asked her about the current scandal enveloping the Trump administration \u2014 one alleged to involve, among other things, a massive coverup. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical that we begin with the core issue,\u201d she says. \u201cThe president of the United States made an offer and also a threat to a foreign leader.\u201d She said every law student knows you don\u2019t need an explicit threat. \u201cTo predicate the delivery of goods and services to the government of Ukraine premised on receiving information or at least having an investigation launched against a political opponent is black-letter law. And it is problematic.\u201d She adds, \u201cThe notion that he had to make a threat a la a 1920s gangster movie is both a misreading of the law and a lowering of the standards we should have for the highest office in the land.\u201d She reiterates the main issue is that the president \u201cmisused his office for political gain.\u201d\n\nShe says, \u201cWe have always been a nation that has expressed our politics tribally. What is different today is that we celebrate the refusal to accept facts.\u201d Instead of accepting reality, we \u201cdouble down.\u201d She observes, \u201cWe give the highest credence to the boldest lie. That\u2019s what terrifies me.\"\n\nShe acknowledges that on election night 2016, \u201cI was deeply disappointed. I was certainly despondent. I wouldn\u2019t say I was surprised.\u201d She points to the language and environment Donald Trump created as affecting voters\u2019 sense of right and wrong.\n\nHowever, she takes the view that it should serve as a wake-up call. \u201cI also believe it was a galvanizing moment to remind us that our democracy is not perfect, that it is both resilient but it is vulnerable.\u201d She argues, \u201cOur obligation is to fight for its resilience by shoring up its vulnerability.\u201d\n\nShe has been fighting for voting rights since she was 18. Coming from the deep South, she had heard the kind of racist, homophobic and xenophobic language Trump used. \u201cThe glorification that he received for it was deeply disturbing,\u201d she says. Before and after Trump, she explains, she has been driven by a basic conviction. \u201cI fundamentally believe that poverty is immoral, that it is economically inefficient and that it is solvable. And by attacking all its vestiges, we make our country stronger and our people stronger.\"\n\nShe acknowledges that Trump\u2019s election had an electrifying effect on women. During her 2018 run, she recalls, \u201cWhat was so extraordinary in Georgia is that we saw that effect happen across the state, regardless of where you lived in Georgia. Women were activated, and they believed they could effect change. It was also irrespective of race.\u201d Nonwhite voters who had not been courted by either party organized themselves.\n\nAfrican American women\u2019s strong participation in U.S. politics is characterized by their votes for policies that are most needed in their communities but for which they often receive the fewest resources. To white women who had voted Republican and now recognize the toxicity of the GOP, Abrams says, in effect, \u201cWelcome aboard.\" She also says, \u201dYou will find from every woman of color you talk to, every African American woman you speak to, that the more, the merrier. You may have taken a moment to arrive, but thank God you are here so we can get this work done.\"\n\nShe tells people, especially women and those who are marginalized and intimidated by the thought of running for office, \u201cWe often tell ourselves we have to be experts in everything before we run. However, there is an entire class of politicians who woke up one day, had a good hair day and decide they should be in charge of the world.\u201d She tells audiences that \u201call you need is the ability to ask questions and some intellectual curiosity.\" The problem with lackluster politicians, she observes, is that \u201cthey lack intellectual curiosity.\u201d She explains, \u201cThey refuse to ask questions, which means they are not open to information. That goes back to the challenge of facts. When you think you know everything already, your willingness to take in new information and reach new conclusions is almost impossible.\u201d She tells people in underrepresented communities, \u201cIf you are capable of asking questions and more importantly of listening to answers, you are more than prepared to run for office. There are people already running for office who lack both capacities.\u201d\n\nI asked her how women behave differently from men in political organizations. \u201cThe research will tell you that women are more collaborative and they have a tendency to cultivate leadership within their ranks.\u201d Women, especially women of color, she says, become \u201cexpert in navigating obstacles men don\u2019t see. You are often underresourced so you become better at hacking solutions.\u201d She thinks women tend to look at obstacles as \u201copportunities for guerrilla warfare.\u201d\n\nHer work now centers on efforts to extend voter registration, improve access to the ballot box and guarantee all votes are counted. \u201cWe have been trained to see voter suppression through the lens of the 1960s.\u201d Today, voter suppression is not violent or overt but is \u201cmore insidious,\" often treated as\u201duser error.\" She explains that what a well-prepared or economically comfortable voter may see as a small inconvenience may seem like a \u201cmassive obstacle\u201d to someone without resources or experience in voting. \u201cWe are on the cusp of losing the machinery of democracy, in part because those who are targeted are fast becoming the majority of the population. My clarion call is that we have to work on this now because it is only going to become worse.\u201d\n\nShe also recognizes the danger of outside meddling and media manipulation, but she puts the onus back on politicians: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the federal will to block election insecurity and deal with foreign interference.\u201d She also points out that in a free society we cannot eliminate disinformation. Because we can only control certain factors, it behooves us to focus on those. \u201cCandidates have to be responsible for outreach to communities they have ignored.\u201d When candidates opt not to communicate with certain people, they cut off the flow of good information. Voters don\u2019t stop getting information, but rather get only disinformation. \u201cCandidates have to be intentional about filling that pipelines. We didn\u2019t do that fully in 2016,\u201d she points out.\n\nDemocrats running in 2020, she cautions, should not assume certain voters will always vote their way or never vote their way. She tells candidates, \u201cTalk to everyone. Spend your resources on everyone but spend a commensurate amount based on their ideological belief, meaning they are more likely to vote for you.\u201d She draws an analogy to a game of roulette. \u201cYou\u2019re putting all your chips on what you guess the wheel will do. I say spread your money around and your likelihood of victory goes up.\u201d Democrats, she says, keep \u201cwaiting for the winning number\u201d rather than \u201cplaying all the odds.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have been pleading with Abrams to run for an open Senate seat, but she has made clear she is not interested. For now, she is dedicating her time to making sure Democrats don\u2019t repeat the mistakes of the past, including underestimating the danger of voter suppression. Don\u2019t kid yourself, however. When Democrats finally pick a presidential nominee, Abrams is sure to be on the short list for vice president.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Stacey Abrams shows why she\u2019s the most popular progressive not in the race\n\nJennifer Rubin: Stacey Abrams gives a graduate school class on voter suppression\n\nBrian Klaas: Trump is holding election security hostage\n\nPaul Waldman: How Democrats can overcome Republican voter suppression\n\nPaul Waldman: How a dead man\u2019s hard drives are exposing the GOP attack on democracy", "description": "A conversation with Stacey Abrams.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer", "September At Am", "Jennifer Rubin Writes Reported Opinion For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kOZ24CuvHrrSFMZmiiFLerD9Erg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FI53CIWBJQI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
