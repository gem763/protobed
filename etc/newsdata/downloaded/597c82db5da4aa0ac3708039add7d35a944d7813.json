Another poor Labor Department jobs report on Friday could add to the gloom.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch in the September employment report.\n\nThe over and under\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch predict the U.S. added 147,000 new jobs last month, a bit higher than the preliminary 130,000 gain in August.\n\nThree or four years ago that wouldn\u2019t seem like much. Back then the U.S. was adding an average of more than 200,000 new jobs a month.\n\nYet an increase of that size now would suggest the labor market is still in good shape, potentially calming the angst in financial markets, at least temporarily.\n\nAfter all, the labor market has virtually run out of skilled and experienced people who can be hired right off the street. What\u2019s more, the economy only needs to add about 100,000 jobs a month to absorb up all the new people entering the labor force.\n\nWhat worries investors is the sharp deceleration in hiring since the spring, a decline that\u2019s coincided with a weakening global economy and a flareup in U.S. trade tensions with China.\n\nIf hiring falls short of forecast, the worries will only grow. \u201cThe clear risk for markets is for a downside surprise to the September jobs number,\u201d Citibank economists told clients.\n\nRead: ADP says just 135,000 private-sector jobs created in September\n\nUnemployment rate\n\nThe U.S. jobless rate is expected to hold at 3.7%, just above a 50-year low.\n\nSo far there\u2019s little evidence layoffs are on the rise despite scattered reports that more companies are cutting jobs. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits has remained in the low 200,000s and also sit near a half-century low.\n\nSo long as job creations tops 100,000 a month, the unemployment rate is likely to decline, even if the economy continues to slow.\n\nOpinion: Factory jobs are again shrinking in industrial Midwestern states\n\n\n\nManufacturing malaise\n\nAmerican factory activity contracted in September for the second straight month and fell to a 10-year low, underscoring the damage caused by the trade war with China. The spat has raised the cost of supplies, disrupted supply chains and hurt exports.\n\nRead: U.S. manufacturers experience worst month since Great Recession, ISM finds\n\nHiring has also taken a hit. Manufacturing employment has barely grown in 2019 and some firms say they are cutting back hours or trimming jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a reduction in sales orders and, therefore, a lower demand for products we order. We have also reduced our workforce by 10%,\u201d an executive at a plastics and rubber manufacturer told the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nThe big question is, does the weakness in manufacturing spread to the much larger service side of the U.S. economy?\n\nRead: Manufacturing slump could still hurt the broader economy, but not trigger a recession\n\nSteady wage gains\n\nHourly pay has increased sharply in the past several months and another gain is expected in September, keeping the yearly increase in wages at a healthy 3.2% or so.\n\nJust nine months ago, some top officials at the Federal Reserve worried rising wages might lead to higher inflation, but those concerns have faded. Now the Fed is more worried about and how the trade war with China is affecting growth.\n\nRead: Fed rate-cut in October seen as more likely after weak ISM report\n\nEven a faster increase in wages is unlikely to deter the central bank from cutting interest rates again soon. Many Fed watchers think the Fed might have to cut again as soon as its next meeting in late October.", "description": "The U.S. stock market has taken a beating this week after fresh warning signs about the economy.
