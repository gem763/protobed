CEO Ed Stack said Dick\u2019s will remove firearms from markets where the sales currently underperform. In place of the guns, Dick\u2019s will be selling licensed sports gear and other outdoor recreational gear that tends to sell faster.", "description": "Sales have been dipping since the retailer tested restricting gun sales in some markets last year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/fk4kldHHL-VFp6fb-2h_UHWWJEw=/0x112:3000x1800/1920x1080/2019/03/12/1552416969927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
