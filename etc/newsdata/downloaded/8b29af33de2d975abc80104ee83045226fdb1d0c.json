But we do realise that this could cause some delay. They\u2019re definitely not cancelled.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have balked at the suggestion, noting that congress funded the projects in question and should not have to fund them again.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s irresponsible decision to transfer funds from appropriated US military construction makes America less safe and dishonours the constitution,\u201d house speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\n\nShe said cancelling military construction projects \u201dwill undermine our national security and the quality of life and morale of our troops\u201d.\n\nSenator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned that future presidents would try to tap money for their own desired initiatives through emergency declarations if courts don\u2019t rule against the administration\u2019s border emergency.\n\n\u201cWith this move, President Trump is short-changing our troops and taxpayers and forcing them to bear the burden of his broken, preposterous campaign promise,\u201d Mr Reed said.\n\n\u201cDefence spending is supposed to be for national defence. There is no credible reason to divert these funds, and doing so in this manner could disrupt national security efforts.\u201d\n\nMilitary construction money finances projects range from renovating schools on US military bases to expanding naval piers to accommodate more submarines.\n\nAn analysis by The Washington Post this year found that projects in Puerto Rico and initiatives to help European nations deter Russia were particularly vulnerable to being defunded.\n\nThe Pentagon said the projects were not being scrapped and that money would be spent only as it was needed to fund the wall contracts. It also suggested it would be seeking ways for congress and foreign nations to still pay for affected projects.\n\n\u201cThese projects are important,\u201d Mr Hoffman said. \u201cThe intent in prioritising funds in this manner is to provide time to work with congress to determine opportunities to restore funds, as well as work with our allies and partners on improving cost burden-sharing for the overseas construction projects.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats, who have uniformly opposed Mr Trump\u2019s emergency declaration at the border, have vowed not to \u201cbackfill\u201d the money.\n\nThere are about 3,000 active-duty troops and 2,000 National Guardsmen serving on the US border.\n\nMr Trump deployed them to help support US Customs and Border Protection, which has been coping with large numbers of arrivals of primarily Central American migrant families.\n\nA statute in US code, known as Section 2808, allows the defence secretary, during national emergencies requiring the use of the armed forces, to carry out construction projects in support of the troops without the approval of congress.\n\nMr Trump, who is scrambling to fast-track border barrier construction before next year\u2019s election, announced the national emergency after the longest government shutdown in US history, which stemmed from his dispute with congress over how much to fund the projects.\n\nThe US president said he declared the national emergency so he could build the wall faster. \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d\n\nThe projects will mark the first time that the administration has tapped the Defence Department dollars that the national emergency allowed Mr Trump to access since the declaration in February.\n\nThe Trump administration has previously used a different law that did not require a national emergency declaration to access Pentagon funds for the barrier.\n\nThe administration has allocated about $2.5 billion (\u00a32.06 billion) from the Pentagon budget for wall-related construction projects in Arizona, California and New Mexico using a counterdrug law, which permits the Defence Department to construct fences in drug-smuggling corridors for federal, local, tribal and state agencies.\n\nThe administration is also planning to use $601 million (\u00a3495 million) from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund for construction of the barrier.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has said it will continue to challenge Trump\u2019s use of emergency authorities to tap Pentagon funds for the wall in court.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government sat on these so-called \u2018emergency funds\u2019 for seven months further confirms that this is nothing but an unlawful power grab,\u201d said Dror Ladin, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s National Security Project. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in court very soon to block Trump\u2019s latest effort to raid military funds for his xenophobic wall.\"\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "The US defence secretary has agreed to free up $3.6 billion (\u00a32.97 billion) from the Pentagon budget for the Mexico border wall by effectively\u00a0defunding\u00a0127 military construction projects.", "authors": ["Paul Sonne"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/09/us-border-wall.jpg"}
