In \u201cSous Vide: Better Home Cooking\u201d (Oct. 15, Clarkson Potter ), chef Hugh Acheson advocates adopting this restaurant method at home: \u201cIt is a way to efficiently and cleanly make you a better cook, and the often long cook times give you the same freedom that the slow cooker does: the power to walk away from the kitchen and return hours later to a nourishing from-scratch meal.\u201d These delicious fall recipes from the book are a great place to start.\n\nPork Ribs With Guajillo BBQ Sauce\n\nACTIVE TIME: 20 minutes TOTAL TIME: 1 day (includes marinating) SERVES: 4\n\nDisplacement Method When you submerge a bag with food inside into a water bath, the air is pushed out of the bag, which in turn allows the food in the bag to stay under the water. If you\u2019re using a resealable zip-lock plastic bag, lower the food-filled bag into your water bath and watch the bag close around the food. You can zip the thing shut, leaving an inch or so open so the air can escape, and then zip that last inch once the last bubble of air gets out. Then you can drop the bag into the bath, or clip it, sealed, with a heavy binder clip to the top of the water bath, so that the food is submerged but the top of the bag is still out of the water. This ensures you won\u2019t have any open-bag mishaps in the water bath.\n\nMake spice rub: In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons ground cumin, 2 tablespoons ground coriander, \u00bc teaspoon ground white pepper, 1 tablespoon ground guajillo chile, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar and 1 tablespoon salt, and stir until everything is incorporated. // On a cutting board, cut 5 pounds pork ribs into 4 racks. Liberally season ribs with spice rub and let sit, covered, in refrigerator overnight. // The next day, preheat circulator water bath to 74 degrees Celsius / 165.2 degrees Fahrenheit. // Remove ribs from refrigerator, transfer to a resealable gallon-size plastic bag, and seal using displacement method (see instructions below). Sink bag in circulator water bath and cook 12 hours. After that, you can hold them there hot until ready to finish. Replace water in bath as necessary. // 45 minutes before ribs are ready to be removed from the water bath, make guajillo BBQ sauce: Heat 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. When oil begins to shimmer, add \u00bd sweet yellow onion, minced, and cook until it is starting to brown in spots, 4-5 minutes. Add 4 cloves garlic, chopped, and cook until golden brown and fragrant, 2 minutes. Add 8 guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded, 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes and 2 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring often, 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool 10 minutes. // Transfer tomato mixture to a blender and blend to a paste. Add 1 cup honey and 1\u00bd cups cider vinegar, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. If sauce seems too thick, thin it with a little more water. If it\u2019s too loose, gently simmer a bit to reduce. Season sauce with salt to taste. // Set broiler to high. Set a wire rack on a sheet pan. Remove ribs from bag and discard any liquids. Place ribs on wire rack and pat dry with paper towels. Broil ribs until a nice crust forms, 3-4 minutes. Remove ribs from broiler and spoon a few tablespoons of guajillo BBQ sauce over them. Place ribs back under broiler until sauce begins to bubble and brown a bit, 2-3 minutes more. Transfer ribs to a platter. Serve with extra guajillo BBQ sauce on the side.\n\nDashi-Braised Turnips\n\nThis recipe begins with instructions for making sous-vide dashi. You\u2019ll have plenty left over to use in other dishes. Hakurei, aka Tokyo turnips, work best here. The turnips should be no bigger than a golf ball.\n\nDashi-braised turnips Photo: Andrew Thomas Lee\n\nACTIVE TIME: 20 minutes TOTAL TIME: 3 hours (includes making dashi) SERVES: 4 as a side\n\nPreheat circulator water bath to 85 degrees Celsius/185 degrees Fahrenheit. // Place 2 ounces dried kombu in a clean 2-quart Mason jar, one with a new lid and band, and pour in 7 cups cold water. Cover with lid and tighten band so it\u2019s finger-tight. Submerge jar in circulator water bath, with water level a couple inches below top of jar, and cook 2 hours. At the 2-hour mark, carefully remove lid from jar while it is still in hot water bath. Add 2 tablespoons dried bonito flakes. Seal jar once again and cook 15 minutes more. Use a jar lifter or tongs to carefully remove jar from water bath. Strain dashi into a clean container. Reserve 1 cup to use in the following recipe steps. Let remaining dashi cool in refrigerator, where it will keep a couple days, or transfer dashi to 1-cup containers and freeze up to 6 months. // Combine 1 pound small turnips, cut into large bite-size pieces, 1 cup dashi, 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon salt in a resealable gallon-size plastic bag and seal using the displacement method (see instructions below). Submerge bag in circulator water bath and cook 30 minutes. Remove bag from hot water bath and strain turnips over a bowl. Discard cooking liquid, or use it to cook the turnip greens. // Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large stainless-steel skillet over medium heat. When butter begins to froth, add strained turnips and 2 tablespoons light soy sauce and cook, turning turnips once or twice as they cook, until they begin to color, about 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, toss to distribute, and transfer turnips to a platter. Season with \u00bd teaspoon salt and serve immediately.\n\nVitello Tonnato\n\nTOTAL TIME: 2\u00bd hours SERVES: 4-6 as an appetizer\n\nVitello Tonnato Photo: Andrew Thomas Lee\n\nHOT ITEMS / ESSENTIAL SOUS-VIDE GEAR Photo: All-Clad THE MAGIC WAND THE MAGIC WAND All-Clad Sous Vide Immersion Circulator This gizmo is the sine qua non of sous-vide cooking, providing precise temperature control by heating and circulating water. $200, surlatable.com Photo: Rubbermaid THE WATER BATH Rubbermaid Commercial Products Plastic Space Saving Square Food Container Fill with water, clip an immersion circulator to the side and you\u2019re good to go. $16, amazon.com\n\nPreheat circulator water bath to 48 degrees Celsius/118.4 degrees Fahrenheit. // Cook the veal: Tie 1 pound trimmed boneless veal loin with kitchen twine to hold its shape during cooking.

Seal bag using the displacement method. Immerse bag in circulator water bath and cook 1 hour; after that, you can hold it there hot until you\u2019re ready to finish. // 5 minutes before veal has finished cooking, prepare an ice bath. When veal is done, plunge bag into ice bath and let cool there 30 minutes. Transfer bag to refrigerator until ready to serve. // When you are ready to serve veal, make tonnato sauce: Drain \u00bc cup good-quality canned tuna, transfer to a blender, and add 2 tablespoons chicken stock, 1 teaspoon rinsed and chopped canned anchovies, 1 tablespoon capers and 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard.
