REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson /File Photo\n\nMuch of northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state \u201cred flag\u201d fire alert, though no major blazes have been reported.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the weather passes, PG&E will begin safety inspections with 6,300 field personnel and 45 helicopters standing at the ready once we get the all clear,\u201d the utility said in a tweet on Thursday.\n\nECONOMIC COST\n\nOakland supermarkets brought in refrigeration trucks to save food and Montclair businesses like Laurie Shepherd\u2019s dental clinic were unable to tell patients when they would reopen.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring,\u201d said Shepherd by phone, after she tore a tendon rushing to prepare for the outages. \u201cWe were just left up in the air.\u201d\n\nMichael Wara of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment estimated the economic cost of the shutdown could reach $2.5 billion, with small businesses hit hardest as they typically lacked back-up generators.\n\nSome of California\u2019s most devastating wildfires were sparked in recent years by damage to electrical transmission lines from recurring bouts of high winds, which then spread the flames through tinder-dry vegetation into populated areas.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.\n\nIn Santa Rosa, a California wine country town where entire subdivisions were destroyed by a deadly 2017 wildfire, restaurateurs Mark and Terri Stark said they had to close one of their six restaurants after it lost power.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) workers walk during a gas line inspection in a neighborhood destroyed by the Tubbs Fire, in Santa Rosa, California, U.S., October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo\n\n\u201cThis is preventative medicine and medicine sometimes is not good to take,\u201d said Mark Stark, 60, who lost one restaurant in the 2017 blaze. The fires in that region killed 46 people.\n\n\u201cThose fires and what they caused are still very real for people in our \u2018hood,\u201d he said.", "description": "A California dentist canceled dozens of appointments and supermarkets tried to save rotting food on Thursday as electricity was cut to over 600,000 homes and workplaces in a second day of planned power outages to cut wildfire risks.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439469621&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992DI", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
