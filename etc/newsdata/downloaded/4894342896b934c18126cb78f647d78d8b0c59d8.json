Two days later, at a closed-door CWC meeting Rahul Gandhi offered to resign as Congress president. A two and a half months long leadership vacuum followed until Sonia Gandhi stepped in as an interim president. Five months on it is time for a new round of important assembly elections. And yet, instead of pulling itself up by the bootstraps, the party continues to be in an endlessly hand-wringing mourning for the passing of the mantle by the First Family.\n\nParty elder Salman Khurshid says the party\u2019s biggest problem is that \u201cour leader has walked away \u2026 Sonia Gandhi stepped in, but there is more than an indication that she is treating herself as a stop-gap arrangement. I wish it wasn\u2019t so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to romanticize the Devdas syndrome in the middle of the battleground, which is what politics is.
