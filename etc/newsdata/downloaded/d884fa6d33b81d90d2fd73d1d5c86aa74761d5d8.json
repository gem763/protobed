An escalation in the U.S.-China trade war has increased fears for a global economic slowdown.\n\nIHS Markit\u2019s August final manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) was 47.0, matching an earlier flash reading but well below the 50 level separating growth from contraction.\n\nWhile an improvement on July\u2019s 46.5, that month\u2019s reading was the lowest since December 2012.\n\nAn index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 47.9 from 46.9 but also spent its seventh month below the breakeven mark.\n\n\u201cEuro zone producers are suffering as the summer slump in factory production persisted into August.
