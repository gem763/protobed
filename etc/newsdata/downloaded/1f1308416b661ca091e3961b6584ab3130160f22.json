Those individuals include Michael Avenatti, Julie Swetnik and Judy Munro-Leighton. Leighton admitted to investigators she made up rape allegations against Kavanaugh to \"get attention\" and as part of a \"ploy\" to take down his nomination.", "description": "", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "September", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2018-11-06"}
