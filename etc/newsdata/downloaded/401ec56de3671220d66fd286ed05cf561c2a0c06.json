National distributors, meanwhile, failed to take action on suspicious orders, plaintiffs argue.\n\nThe drug companies deny accusations that they worked in concert to market the drugs, arguing that they complied with federal regulations and delivered legitimate medications to patients experiencing painful conditions, such as cancer.\n\nPlaintiffs are seeking compensation to recoup sums of money governments have spent on healthcare and criminal issues since the onset of the crisis, which has totaled more than $500 billion, according to some counts.\n\nOne of the original defendants, Johnson & Johnson, has reached a $20.4 million settlement agreement with two Ohio counties listed as plaintiffs in the case, allowing it to sit out Monday\u2019s trial. Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, also has filed for bankruptcy as part of a settlement deal. However, both agreements still need final approval.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 A landmark trial will begin in Ohio federal court on Monday that observers say will play a substantial role in determining who is", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
