(Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)\n\nThe story of the 2019 Toronto Blue Jays season will not be remembered all that fondly by the statisticians and record keepers that play such a large role in baseball lore.\n\nA year that \u2014 at best \u2014 will featured the sixth most losses the team has collected in a full season has been filled with a series of dubious record-setting statistics that paint a fairly accurate picture of a dire on-field product.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe team has already plowed through a franchise record in number of pitchers used and number of starting pitchers used while relying heavily on rookies.

Randal Grichuk, Teoscar Hernandez, Freddy Galvis, Rowdy Tellez, Cavan Biggio, Brandon Drury and Justin Smoak have been the most common offenders to be sent back to the dugout without putting the ball in play.\n\nMore Blue Jays coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "The 2019 Toronto Blue Jays have been punched out by opposition pitching more than any team in franchise history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZVH3gu3IYdwWd6dc9azKMA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MDAuOA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PbJvxvsR2fHXY14xKLgi6w--~B/aD0xNTk2O3c9MjkxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/33c33df0-d9a7-11e9-bf7d-325a5770e34b", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
