Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie\u2019s elegant Belgian detective, he of the exquisitely groomed mustache and constantly whirring little gray cells, died of a heart attack in 1975. The crime novelist Sophie Hannah had never imagined that any writer would summon him back to the page. \u201cI would no sooner have considered it than I would have considered applying to be the queen of England,\u201d she says. And yet, when her agent informed her that the Christie family was seeking a writer to revive the great man, she realized she already had a plot in mind. \u201cI think the only reason I could do it was because I\u2019d read all of her Poirot novels so many times they literally were programmed into my brain,\u201d she explained in a recent phone call.\n\nHannah\u2019s resurrected Poirot first delivered one of his famous denouements in 2014, in the ingeniously plotted The Monogram Murders. While the critics debated about how well she re-created the great investigator (the Independent praised it as \u201cimmensely satisfying\u201d; the Guardian slighted it as \u201cdiluted essence of Poirot\u201d) the author continued to lead the sleuth through a series of mysterious and murderous adventures. Her fourth Poirot novel will be out next summer. Here, Hannah walks us through how she channeled the goddess of crime fiction.\n\nI\u2019ve been an Agatha fan since I was 12 years old, but writing a new Agatha Christie novel is just not something that would ever have occurred to me. My agent was the one who suggested it to Harper Collins. He was at their offices for a meeting about one of his other authors, and he happened to be sitting in a room that was full of Agatha Christie novels. Off the top of his head, he proposed the idea. The editor said, \u201cOh no, the family would never want something like that to happen.\u201d But as it turned out, at that very moment the Christie family were deciding they did, in fact, want more books to be written. It was an incredible coincidence.\n\nI think the Christies wanted a way to remind people that Agatha Christie is still a very relevant and popular writer. Sherlock Holmes and James Bond were being revived and given new leases on life. Why not Agatha? So a meeting was arranged. They asked whether I\u2019d prefer to write Poirot or Marple. And although I love them both equally as a reader, the idea that was forming in my brain for a possible Christie continuation novel felt more suited to Poirot. As soon as I\u2019d heard about the possibility, I realized this idea I\u2019d had two or three years earlier and hadn\u2019t managed to make work would actually be perfect for a Poirot novel. Before Poirot, I\u2019d always written contemporary crime novels, and this idea was not a contemporary idea. The mind-set required for the plot to work is more old-fashioned.\n\nI thought the plot would be better suited to Poirot because the solution to the mystery was very clever. Poirot likes showing off when he delivers the solution to the mystery, and I could already picture him showing off his solution to a roomful of people. There are some elements Christie\u2019s Poirot plots always involve. There\u2019s always a super clever ending, a very staged denouement scene where everyone is gathered together and the solution is revealed, sometimes at great length. Then there are the clues, red herrings, the completely unguessable and unpredictable plot. The real genius of Agatha is that she plays absolutely fair with you. All the clues are there, but you just never guess where her plots are going.\n\nThe Christie family and I discussed setting the new books in the present day. I knew instantly I would not want to do that. The whole thing about Poirot is he\u2019s not contemporary, and anyone who might want to read a new Poirot novel would not want Poirot to be changed. If I had invented a version of him that existed now, would he have a Twitter account? Would he be on Snapchat? I don\u2019t like it when something traditional and brilliant is messed with. This happened to me once \u2014 I went to see Macbeth, it was some innovative new director who was doing the production. It wasn\u2019t set in Scotland, it was set in, I don\u2019t know, a call center in South London. No. That is not Macbeth! The Christie family was delighted when they discovered how traditional I was. You know, I love new and exciting, but I saw my job as bringing a new and exciting mystery to the traditional Poirot, not to start messing with any aspects of Poirot as a character. I also don\u2019t think Agatha feels dated at all. That\u2019s partly because what drives her plots are things that are equally true of humans today. People still kill because of extreme jealousy, or because they\u2019re terrified their secret will be found out. She goes for these archetypal, eternal, human dilemmas. She\u2019s classic but not dated, which is, you know, obviously the ideal.\n\nIf I had invented a version of him that existed now, would he have a Twitter account? Would he be on Snapchat? I don\u2019t like it when something traditional and brilliant is messed with.\n\nWe also debated exactly when to set my Poirot. He dies at the end of Agatha\u2019s last book about him, Curtains. I certainly didn\u2019t want to bring him back to life because that never works. Remember when Bobby Ewing came back to life in Dallas? Nobody was impressed. There was some talk about my Poirot novel being a prequel to The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which was Agatha\u2019s first, but we decided that wouldn\u2019t work because Agatha\u2019s first Poirot novel should always remain the first Poirot novel. Then my editor at HarperCollins pointed out there were four years between 1928 and 1932 when Agatha didn\u2019t write any Poirot novels. He was unaccounted for. In all of our opinions, that was the classic Poirot era, so my first, The Monogram Murders, is set in 1929, and the next two, which are called Closed Casket and the Mystery of Three Quarters, are both set in 1930.\n\nI didn\u2019t do too much historical research. I needed to know if certain things existed in 1929, like whether hotels had elevators, or if most private homes had telephone lines. I did stay in Agatha\u2019s holiday home, Greenway, which is an absolutely stunning house in the Devon countryside. I stay there quite regularly now, but initially I stayed there while I was writing the plan of The Monogram Murders. I always knew I wanted to stay there, but until I did, I thought, come on, you know, it is just a house. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to stay there and suddenly be filled with Poirot inspiration. And yet, that was exactly what happened.\n\nOnce I started writing Agatha novels myself, I realized how much I\u2019d absorbed her influence over the years. I never had to think, I hope I\u2019m doing enough Agatha-ish things. I saw, in fact, that all the contemporary crime novels I\u2019d written were pretty Agatha-ish already in their priorities and structure. I don\u2019t think I could have written any other author\u2019s detective in the same way. I didn\u2019t find it intimidating to write Poirot precisely because nobody can fill Agatha\u2019s shoes. I knew I could write a book and feel proud of it, and okay, maybe it wasn\u2019t going to be as good as Agatha Christie, but I think that\u2019s an unrealistic thing to aim for. What I wanted to do was write books that were good enough to really appeal to people who love Agatha and loved Poirot.\n\nIn some ways, Poirot is a bit like a superhero. His personal life, if he has one, doesn\u2019t get in the way. At the same time he is a flawed, slightly weird character. And so he seems very real. Once you\u2019ve encountered Poirot, you just don\u2019t forget to him. He\u2019s visually memorable \u2014 the way he talks, the way he thinks. All his little foibles, his insistence on order and method. I think he\u2019s just the best character crime fiction has ever produced.", "description": "Author Sophie Hannah on continuing Agatha Christie\u2019s classic Poirot series \u2014 and why the detective definitely shouldn\u2019t have a Twitter account.", "authors": ["Lila Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-agatha-christie-monogram-murders-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
