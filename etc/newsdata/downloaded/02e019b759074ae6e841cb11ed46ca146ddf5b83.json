Those involve buying prime real estate and investing in new buildings with little need for renovation. But PFA also does projects similar to those targeted by Blackstone, in which existing properties are renovated, he said.\n\n\"We are approaching the end of this economic cycle and our customers want an above average risk. We have the most appetite for value-add investments going forward,\" Bruhn said.\n\nBlackstone has been criticised by the Danish government for charging excessively high rents after investing in renovations. The firm has countered that it renovates buildings that haven't been upgraded \"for decades.\" Blackstone also says it only represents around 0.5 per cent of the Copenhagen rental market.\n\nIn an interview with Denmark's state broadcaster, DR, Blackstone's head of real estate in Europe, James Seppala, said: \"We are focused on long-term value creation for our investors that are predominantly public-sector pension plans from all over the world.\"\n\nNone of the pension funds contacted by Bloomberg said they partnered with Blackstone on any of their property investments.\n\nAccording to the report, which is due to be published this week, one model includes scrapping a provision in Denmark's housing law that lets property owners increase rents substantially if they carry out renovations for more than 183,000 kroner ($27,300). According to the model, owners would see the value of their investments in the major Danish cities decrease by as much as 47 per cent, the documents show.\n\nResidents would face average rent price increases of about 40 per cent instead of the current average of 80 per cent after landlords complete renovations, under the model.\n\nFor pension funds in Denmark, such changes wouldn't upend their investment models, according to Peter Olsson, managing director of AP Property, a unit of AP Pension, which has about $20 billion under management. He says that AP doesn't use the model for which Blackstone has been criticised.\n\n\"We are going to increase our investments in real estate from about 5 per cent to around 10 per cent regardless of the current political focus,\" Olsson said.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Six Danish pension funds plan to expand their portfolios of real estate and alternative assets with the expectation yields on bonds will remain negative.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2478%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4df177037cc0ef4c1c7886ef883825829e82cb5c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
