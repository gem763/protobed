We did not expect someone to run after the car seeing that no one was inside.'\n\nWhen the passerby (pictured) noticed the moving car didn't have driver he quickly chased after the car in an attempt to stop it\n\nThe passerby (pictured) manages to grab the cars rear end before the Tesla owner lets him know the self-driving car is okay\n\nThe man manages to get a hold of the Tesla's side door when the owner yells, 'it's okay!'\n\nRelieved, the man throws his hands up and walks back to his own car.\n\n'They did the right thing! This is, however, a sign of the times which are rapidly progressing tech-wise,' the owner said.\n\nThe Tesla completes the driverless function flawlessly when it appropriately stops at the parking lot's intersection and then drives towards the owner.\n\nBut this successful example of the Smart Summon mode seems to be one of many other hiccups and crashes.\n\nThe owner said: 'They did the right thing! This is, however, a sign of the times which are rapidly progressing tech-wise'\n\nElon Musk has been ridiculed for claiming he's on the brink of perfecting a fleet of self-driving taxis after Tesla owners reported that their cars crash on summon mode.\n\nThe CEO of Tesla says that the fleet will be ready by the end of next year, but that has been called into question after the release of Tesla's Smart Summon technology.\n\nRaj Rajkumar, from Carnegie Mellon University, says that the California company's new feature is 'far from perfection' and he can 'only laugh' at Musk's timeline.\n\nMany Tesla owners using the summon function, which calls their car to them without anyone in, have experienced several close calls and nasty fender benders.\n\nScroll down for videos\n\nThe release of Tesla's Smart Summon technology has CEO Elon Musk promising a fleet of self-driving taxis by the end of next year. However, an autonomous technology expert is calling his bluff as many owners have experienced issues with the technology and shared them on Twitter\n\n'If Tesla is having some trouble in an uncontrolled situation [like a parking lot], and that [Smart Summon] feature is far from perfection, then Tesla having full self-driving cars at the end of next year? I can only laugh at that,' Raj Rajkumar, who studies autonomous technology at Carnegie Mellon University, told Wired.\n\nRaj Rajkumar, from Carnegie Mellon University, has argued that Tesla's Smart Summon has proved to be 'far from perfection' and he can 'only laugh' at Musk's timeline\n\nSmart Summon was meant to be a surprise tucked away in Telsa's latest software Version 10.0, which was released last week. The technology enables cars to navigate a parking lot and come to their owner or a destination of choice, as long as their car is within their line of sight\n\nHe noted that one of the hurdles is Tesla's self-driving speed.\n\nAccording to Aarian Marshall with Wired, in order for Tesla's Smart Summon feature to work, sensors only need to be capable of 'seeing' 'a few dozen feet' away.\n\nAnd in parking lots going about 5 mph, the technology can function somewhat.\n\nThe comments come after many owners experienced several close calls and nasty fender benders\n\nHowever, it becomes more complicated when the vehicle is on an open road doing much faster speeds -- as it can not process what is ahead of it in time to maneuver properly.\n\nThe sensors used in the vehicles are equip with eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors and a forward-facing radar unit, and it works by using the Autopilot system.\n\nHowever, Rajukumar does not think the technology is far from a present, but a disaster waiting to happen. This Tesla owner from Frisco, Texas tested out the Summon feature in a parking lot. His red Model 3 Tesla pictured above\n\nThe Autopilot follows the car owner's phone GPS or a specific pinpoint on a map and drives towards them while navigating around obstacles, within a maximum distance of 200 feet.\n\nUnlike the popular opinion, Musk has not included a lidar unit -- a device many believe is the secrete to perfecting a real autonomous vehicle;\n\nBecause of the issues Smart Summon is experiencing, other experts believe putting under a 'full self-driving package' could add confusion and 'prove dangerous', according to Matthew Johnson-Roberson, a director of the University of Michigan and Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles and CEO of the food delivery robot startup Refraction AI.\n\nTesla owner David Guajardo tried the Summon feature on his blue Model 3 car and it bumped into another vehicle exiting a parking space, leaving the Tesla with front bumper damage because it failed to yield\n\nSmart Summon 'ultimately may negatively impact the perception of full self-driving if it doesn't work flawlessly,' he said.\n\nAnd since the release of the technology, many Tesla owners have flocked to Twitter to share their frustrations, close calls and fender benders.\n\nFor Tesla's Smart Summon feature to work, sensors only need to be capable of 'seeing' 'a few dozen feet' away. And in parking lots going about 5 mph, the technology can function somewhat. But, it becomes more complicated when the vehicle is on an open road Aftermath: Guajardo followed up sharing these pictures showing damage to the fog lights\n\nOne man shared a video on Twitter engaging the new feature on his blue Model 3 Tesla in a busy parking lot.\n\nHis car automatically eases out of its parking spot but as it turns and drives towards the owner, it fails to yield to another car backing out of the spot and its it.\n\n'So day 1 with V10 Smart Summon was working beautifully. But someone didn't notice my M3 and made a front bumper damage. We will claim our insurances but who's fault do you guys think it'll be ?' David F Guajardo captioned his video testing out the new feature on Twitter.\n\nHe shared photos showing the scratches and dents suffered in the brief bump.\n\n'It's hard to notice in these pictures but yes, it is damaged including the fog lights,' he captioned his damage photos.\n\nAnother man took to Twitter to show his test in Frisco, Texas.\n\nThe video shows him summon his red Tesla Model 3 from a parking lot across the street as he watches on.\n\nThe car seamlessly navigates out of its spot and the parking lot, but when its time to cross the main street it fails to yield to a passing car with the right of way. The Tesla doesn't stop until the other vehicle comes to a screeching halt.\n\n'Be forewarned @Tesla @elonmusk Enhanced summon isn't safe or production ready. Tried in my empty drive way. Car went forward and ran into the side of garage. Love the car but saddened,' the Twitter user said shared\n\nThis Twitter user says her Tesla turned into a golf cart when she engaged the Summon feature\n\nDriver Roddie Hasan shared the video on Twitter with the caption: 'So, @ElonMusk - My first test of Smart Summon didn't go so well.'\n\nAnother user shared a picture of their badly dented blue Tesla Model 3 that got hit while using the Summon function.\n\n'Be forewarned @Tesla @elonmusk Enhanced summon isn't safe or production ready. Tried in my empty drive way. Car went forward and ran into the side of garage. Love the car but saddened,' the Twitter user said shared.\n\nOne user uploaded video to YouTube testing out the feature and showing the black Model 3 smart car get confused by passing traffic and pedestrians along the way.\n\nHowever not all Summon test drives were failures. For many Tesla owners the feature worked seamlessly. However challenges tend to come when it's dark outside.\n\nTesla says that the Smart Summon is best used in well-lit and less busy areas like private parking lots and driveways\n\nEven Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that parking lots are a 'remarkably hard problem' to solve in a previous interview, but is still hopefully that he can release a fleet of taxi robots by end of next year\n\n'Smart Summon is designed to allow your car to drive to you (using your phone's GPS as a target destination) or a location of your choosing, maneuvering around and stopping for objects as necessary. Like Summon, Smart Summon is only intended for use in private parking lots and driveways,' Tesla explained in release notes for the update.\n\n'You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at times within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles, and cars,' it added.\n\nEven Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that parking lots are a 'remarkably hard problem' to solve in a previous interview.", "description": "The hilarious moment a driverless Tesla using the new Smart Summon feature is mistaken as a runaway car and chased down by a concerned onlooker was captured in Phoenix, Arizona", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore", "Marlene Lenthang", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/18/19339014-0-image-a-6_1570298025189.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
