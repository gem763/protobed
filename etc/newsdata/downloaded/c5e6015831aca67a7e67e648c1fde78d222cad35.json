The president\u2019s tweets reflected his most extensive direct involvement in the monthslong talks.\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,\u201d he wrote. Following the attack, \u201cI immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d\n\nThe cancellation of the meeting is major setback in efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement of the nearly 18-year Afghan war, America\u2019s longest. It couldn\u2019t be determined whether the U.S.-Taliban negotiations in the Gulf state of Qatar had been suspended.\n\nThe U.S. and the Taliban resumed direct talks in Qatar\u2019s capital Doha more than a year ago and last weekend, Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief negotiator to the Afghan peace process, said U.S. and Taliban negotiators had reached the \u201cthreshold\u201d of agreement on a troop drawdown following nine rounds of talks in Qatar. The accord awaited only President Trump\u2019s signoff, he said. The announcement followed assaults by the Taliban on two northern Afghan cities.\n\nOn Thursday, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing in the east of the Afghan capital that killed at least 11 people, including a Romanian and an American soldier, and wounded dozens.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s attack, Mr. Ghani described peace with the Taliban as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon identified the killed service member as Army Sgt. 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34 years old, from Morovis, Puerto Rico. Sgt. Ortiz\u2019s remains are expected to arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware late Saturday night, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mr. Ghani was planning to travel to the U.S. for talks with Mr. Trump, in an apparent bid to shape a peace deal that has so far excluded the Afghan government and been met with criticism in Washington. The Taliban have refused to hold direct talks with any Kabul administration, which it views as illegitimate.\n\nThe dates of the Afghan president\u2019s visit to Washington hadn\u2019t been confirmed, a senior Afghan official said earlier. The U.S. State Department referred a request for comment on Saturday to the White House, which didn\u2019t immediately respond. The Afghan Embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed accord reached \u201cin principle\u201d by the U.S. and the Taliban, roughly 5,000 U.S. troops would withdraw 135 days after the deal is signed.\n\nMost of the remaining 9,500 American forces, along with about 8,600 additional foreign forces, mainly from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, would be withdrawn in phases, provided the Taliban follows through on its assurances not to allow Islamic State, al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups to operate in Afghanistan. The Taliban also would agree to enter talks with other Afghans in Oslo.\n\nAfter Mr. Khalilzad briefed the Afghan government last week about the proposed accord, the Kabul administration said it was concerned because the deal had no penalties should the Taliban not honor promises under the deal.\n\nThe secrecy around the deal and the prospect of a full U.S. withdrawal has drawn criticism on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Rep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, demanded in a letter to Mr. Khalilzad that he testify before the committee and give the American people \u201ca long-overdue opportunity to understand the contours of your negotiations with the Taliban and the potential risks and opportunities that may result.\u201d\n\nSince Aug. 21, four U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan.\n\nWrite to Nancy A.
