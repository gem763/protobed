Germany's trade-sensitive declined 1.1%, with data showing an unexpected rise in industrial output failing to lift the index.\n\nA drop in sterling over a fresh Brexit flare-up cushioned Britain's , which slipped just 0.3%.\n\nThe losses followed mixed messages on trade tensions, with Washington blacklisting eight Chinese tech companies and President Donald Trump suggested a deal to end the trade dispute may not yet be quite in the offing.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way for the first minister-level negotiations in months on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"We have a lot of uncertainty still around \u2013 last night, Trump said there would only be a deal if he really got his way, the Chinese want to exclude all the disputed topics ... some are cautiously optimistic, other are rather skeptical,\" said Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank (DE: ) in Frankfurt.\n\n\"We expect that we could see a mini deal with neither Beijing nor Washington interested in letting this escalate.

The National Holiday celebrations also offered a rare respite to China's retail sector, with spending on goods and dining returning to growth this year.\n\nYet a private survey showed growth in China's services sector at its slowest in seven months in September, offering little momentum to an economy that has been expanding at its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nWith the focus turning to trade talks, Trump also said he hoped Beijing found a humane and peaceful resolution to political protests in Hong Kong, and said that situation had the potential to hurt the discussions.\n\nAn increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25%, is scheduled for Oct. 15. Trump has said it will take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\n\"People are hoping Trump may postpone some of the upcoming tariffs,\" said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. \"Nevertheless, you can't ignore that fact that, up until now, the market has underestimated Trump's determination on tariffs.\"\n\nU.S. futures pointed to a 0.6% drop on open for Wall Street.
