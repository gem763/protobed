October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight. He faces Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made it very clear. My first defence was Carl Frampton, my second fight was the mandatory challenger. I\u2019m open to any of them. I\u2019m leaving my options open and anyone who wants it, I\u2019m here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to face the best in the business, not just in the country but the world. And I know these lot (the fans) will go wherever I want. Everyone has the passports at the ready.\n\n\u201cSo I can say just a massive thank you to the fans. Be ready, 2020, I\u2019m coming for you all.\u201d\n\nIn the fight, Takoucht\u2019s awkward style saw Warrington initially struggle for his range before the defending champion pinned his French challenger against the ropes with a fine four-shot combination.\n\nWarrington then landed a flush right hand just before the bell rang at the end of the first round and it was one-way traffic thereafter.\n\nWarrington increased the intensity as he swamped all over Takoucht, with the 33-year-old struggling to keep the Yorkshireman at bay.\n\nA left to the head and right to the body saw Takoucht hit the canvas for the first time before Warrington fired another barrage of hooks to send his challenger crashing down again with over a minute to go in the second round.\n\nTakoucht was scrambling to hold off another onslaught as Warrington sensed blood but the referee stepped in and waved off the contest to the eruption of the Leeds crowd.\n\nWarrington admitted his scrappy fight against Galahad last time was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d and he had to be fierce against his French challenger after missing out on a unification fight.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing personal between myself and Takoucht but I think I took my frustration on not getting the unification shot and it was a nice day at the office,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that everything we have been working on has worked. The last fight gave us all a wake-up call. We have worked against southpaws in the last few weeks and I\u2019m glad it paid off.\n\n\u201cThe fans are fantastic. Always turn out in their numbers, support me through thick and thin and I can only repay them with a top performance.\u201d\n\nWarrington listed Oscar Valdez and Leo Santa Cruz as possible next opponents, despite their intentions to move up to super featherweight.\n\nChina\u2019s Can Xu, who holds the WBA \u2018regular\u2019 world featherweight strap, is the most likely candidate for Warrington, while he also hinted at unifying against WBC champion Gary Russell Jr or taking on fellow American Shakur Stevenson, who is fighting Joet Gonzalez for the WBO belt later this month.", "description": "Josh Warrington cruised to a dominant second-round knockout victory in his IBF world featherweight title defence against France\u2019s Sofiane Takoucht in Leeds.
