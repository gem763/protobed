Not to get too technical, but that\u2019s a hell of a lot of fancy skincare products. And yet, even though our social media feeds are flooded with new launches on a near-daily basis, there are still a select few products that make up what we think of as the best of their kind \u2014 cult favorites, holy grails, top shelf products. Many of these A-list products come with an A-list price tag (think: Cr\u00e8me de la Mer, La Prairie Skin Caviar Luxe Cream and the like).\n\nSitting comfortably in the top tier of this luxe list is SkinCeuticals\u2019 C E Ferulic, the beloved serum that launched in 2005 after 40 years of academic research. Often regarded as the gold standard of vitamin C serums (a category that\u2019s constantly expanding, thanks to research about the many skin benefits of the antioxidant), SkinCeuticals\u2019 most beloved product will run you $166 and has become a point of near-obsession in the skincare dupes community, with legions of beauty fanatics searching for a less expensive version that provides the same results: firmer and smoother skin, reduced signs of aging and sun damage, and an overall brighter complexion.\n\nWe asked skincare pros if the dermatologist-tested, arguably hot dog-scented SkinCeuticals elixir is really worth its price tag, and compared it to one of its most popular dupes, Timeless\u2019 $18 Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum.\n\nWhat makes SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic so special?\n\nAccording to Chloe Smith, who leads SkinCeuticals\u2019 education and scientific communications team in Canada, \u201cC E Ferulic is precisely formulated to neutralize damaging free-radicals caused by environmental factors.\u201d It claims to improve everything from skin tone to brightness, and even reduce lines and dark spots.\n\nSkinceuticals/Timeless The SkinCeuticals product on the left costs $166, where Timeless' serum on the right has been discounted to just $18.\n\nBut the serum\u2019s most impressive claim to fame? How thoroughly it\u2019s been studied and tested. \u201cC E Ferulic is backed by over 20 international dermatological publications that speak to its safety and efficacy,\u201d Smith told HuffPost. \u201cThese publications are peer-reviewed, the highest level of scientific credibility a brand or researcher can achieve.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s easy for the brand to say. But what about objective outsiders? Monica Li, a dermatologist and skin science instructor at the University of British Columbia, told HuffPost that this level of clinical scrutiny means SkinCeuticals\u2019 claims are legitimate.\n\nOK, but does that research make it worth $166?\n\nLi told HuffPost that \u201cthe pricing of vitamin C serums can reflect years of research leading to the final formulation, and quality controls in place to ensure a formulation achieves its intended goals.\u201d Research is key when developing any skincare product, but can be especially crucial in the development of vitamin C serums, due to the nutrient\u2019s unstable nature.\n\nVitamin C \u201cis a reactive ingredient,\u201d Perry Romanowski, cosmetic chemist and co-creator of BeautyBrains.com, told HuffPost. \u201cIn the presence of oxygen, it will chemically react, which renders it no longer effective at providing skin benefits. In fact, most vitamin C beauty products on the market do not have any antioxidant activity because the vitamin C they put in the formula has oxidized.\u201d But since 2007, SkinCeuticals has held a patent for stabilized ascorbic acid composition, suggesting that the brand has found a way to stabilize vitamin C (and no other brands use that specific method or formulation).\n\nSo are dupes effective at all?\n\nOne of the most popular \u201cdupes\u201d for SkinCeuticals\u2019 C E Ferulic is Timeless\u2019 Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum (usually $25 but currently on sale for $18). The brand states on its website that its \u201cphilosophy is under-sell and over-deliver.\u201d And at first glance, the ingredient lists do look extremely similar.\n\n\u201cBoth use the same type of solvents \u2014 water and ethoxydiglycol,\u201d Romanowski told HuffPost. \u201cThey also have the same active ingredients (ascorbic acid, tocopherol, ferulic acid, panthenol and sodium hyaluronate).\u201d There are only a few minor ingredient differences between the two and those are likely just to get around the SkinCeuticals patent. For example, \u201cSkinCeuticals uses a glycerin/propylene glycol blend, whereas the Timeless product uses only propylene glycol,\u201d explained Romanowski. This may make the SkinCeuticals formula feel a little more sticky.\n\nAny differences in ingredients or percentages (SkinCeuticals uses 15% L-ascorbic acid, while Timeless uses 20%) \u201cmost likely won\u2019t lead to any noticeable difference to the consumer,\u201d Romanowski told us, so there\u2019s no need to dwell on that 5% difference, especially considering the optimal percentage of L-ascorbic acid \u2014 another term for vitamin C \u2014 is actually a range (10-20%).\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s much more to a skincare product than its ingredient list. \u201cThe ingredient list can be misleading and confusing for many consumers,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s required as part of government regulations, and to guide those who may have contact sensitivities and allergies. But there\u2019s important information that an ingredient list alone does not state, such as percentage of the primary active component of a skincare product and pH, which will determine how the skin will interact with or absorb an active ingredient.\u201d\n\nThere are also ingredients that may enhance or prevent delivery of L-ascorbic acid into the skin, and for the average consumer, glancing at an ingredient list won\u2019t reveal those.\n\nSmith offered an analogy to explain why ingredient lists aren\u2019t the only thing that indicates product efficacy: \u201cCompare product development to baking a cake. You could follow a recipe and ingredient list, resulting in a beautiful cake. You could also use the same ingredients in different quantities or in a different order, resulting in a terrible cake. You can\u2019t just compare ingredient to ingredient. The general population is not well-equipped enough to make an informed decision when it comes to product formulation, so we rely on brands that can provide us with the right type of scientific information to provide proof of efficacy.\u201d\n\nSo yes, Timeless\u2019 $18 product may perform similarly to SkinCeuticals\u2019 serum, but there\u2019s the issue of safety and reliability\u2026\n\n\u201cFrom the wealth of clinical studies performed over several decades, SkinCeuticals\u2019 vitamin C formulation [is] shown by peer-reviewed research to be able to effectively deliver active vitamin C into skin cells to fight free radicals,\u201d Li told HuffPost. \u201cDupes can\u2019t undergo testing using these well-researched rules for effective absorption of topical vitamin C, as SkinCeuticals holds the patent that protects its vitamin C formulations.\u201d\n\nThose years of research, clinical studies and peer-reviewed publishings aren\u2019t just for show. They exist to tell the consumer that the product can be trusted. Big, well-known brands spend a ton of money on testing the safety of their products, Romanowski said. \u201cThis is not to say that consumers will have a bad experience [with a product from a smaller, lesser-known brand], but there is a higher likelihood of a bad reaction.\u201d\n\nGiven the volatile, reactive nature of vitamin C, the practical advice is that you shouldn\u2019t have to spend a lot of money on these types of products, Romanowski said. So if you\u2019re not worried about sensitive or reactive skin at all, \u201cstart with the less expensive product and see if it works for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, go up to the next higher priced product and try it. Keep doing this until you find something that works best for you.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line? You may be able to find a vitamin C serum that provides results that are similar to (but not better than) SkinCeuticals\u2019 C E Ferulic at a fraction of the price but it\u2019ll come with the risk of causing a reaction.", "description": "When it comes to vitamin C serums, looking at an ingredients list doesn't tell you the whole story.
