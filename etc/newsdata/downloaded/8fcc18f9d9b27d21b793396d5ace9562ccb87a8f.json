They instead impeach based on whether the president committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" as outlined in Article II, Section 4 of the US constitution.\n\nBut Justice Department veterans say that by pressuring Ukraine's government to investigate his political rivals \u2014 and possibly using taxpayer-funded military aid as a leverage tool \u2014 Trump may well have violated a number of federal laws.\n\n\"The conduct discussed in this complaint is so direct that it's striking,\" said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York who specialized in organized crime. \"You have the President of the United States in direct communication \u2014 some might say collusion \u2014 with the president of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn all, former prosecutors told Insider, there are at least four areas where Trump could face legal jeopardy.\n\nIllegally soliciting campaign help from a foreign government\n\nThe most obvious way in which Trump could have violated the law is by soliciting material campaign aid from a foreign government, which expressly violates the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.\n\nTrump's conduct with Ukraine isn't the first time he's been accused of violating campaign finance laws to help him win an election. He was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, listed as Individual-1 in court documents, in the case against his former personal attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nIn August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal charges in the Southern District of New York including charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and violating federal campaign finance law by making a contribution to the Trump campaign in the form of a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels \u2014 far over the legal campaign contribution limit of $2,7000 \u2014 to buy her silence on an alleged affair she had with Trump.\n\nRead more: Acting DNI Joseph Maguire undermined the GOP's entire argument against the whistleblower in one sentence\n\nBribery\n\nThe second area of potential legal liability for Trump relates to his request that Zelensky do him a \"favor\" right after mentioning how the US \"does a lot for Ukraine,\" and more importantly, after Zelensky raised the issue of US military aid right before Trump requested he investigate Biden.\n\nRead more: The notes on Trump's call with Ukraine's president hint at a quid pro quo over investigating Joe Biden's son\n\n\"From a criminal law point of view, that looks like a quid pro quo,\" said Patrick Cotter, a longtime former federal prosecutor who was part of the team that convicted the Gambino crime family boss John Gotti.\n\n\"And under federal law, that could open Trump up to allegations that he committed the crime of bribery by offering one thing in exchange for another, and doing so for his own personal benefit and not the country's.\"\n\nMisappropriation\n\nThird, Cotter said, if Trump \"in fact used government funds for his own gain, then there is a very strong argument that there is a theft of taxpayer money, or misappropriation, taking place.\"\n\nCotter added that it's possible Trump \"misappropriated $400 million in taxpayer money, and instead of using it for government purposes, he stole it to potentially pay a bribe. People go to jail every day in this country for doing that, and it looks like that's what Trump tried to do.\"\n\nRead more: 'Lawyer up': DOJ veterans have 1 piece of advice for Trump and Giuliani amid the Ukraine whistleblower scandal\n\nConspiracy\n\nLast, if Giuliani, Barr, and other officials were involved in Trump's efforts, as the complaint alleges, that would raise questions about a potential criminal conspiracy.\n\n\"That would include anybody who was part of these transactions,\" Cotter said. \"The key legal concept behind a conspiracy is that everybody in the conspiracy is responsible for everybody else's actions.\"\n\nGiuliani is mentioned 31 times in the whistleblower's complaint, and the document described him as a \"central figure\" in Trump's effort. It said Attorney General William Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"\n\nThe complaint added that Trump referred \"explicitly\" to Giuliani and Barr as \"his personal envoys on these matters\" while speaking to Zelensky.\n\nGiuliani's involvement in the Ukraine scandal also undercuts the central premise of the president's defense: that his conversation with Zelensky related strictly to government business and to Trump's interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nThe complaint paints an intricate portrait of \"the fact that Giuliani was driving a lot of this and doing the legwork for Trump\" in Ukraine, Honig said. \"But why would a private citizen \u2014 not an employee of the United States \u2014 be involved in this unless he was working for the personal, political benefit of his client, Donald Trump?\"", "description": "Former prosecutors told Insider that there are at least four areas where Trump could face legal jeopardy.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e5c472e22af7dbe763237?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
