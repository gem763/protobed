That, of course, opens a whole new can of worms and a whole lot of opportunities for hackers to distribute malicious instances of the Facebook-owned privacy messenger.\n\nThe issue appears to be limited to Android, and not affecting iOS users. In the meantime, it seems that WhatsApp is also not available on third-party app stores, like Huawei\u2018s AppGallery and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Store. I\u2019ll be honest, though, I\u2019ve never used either of these stores, so I wouldn\u2019t even know if it was ever there in the first place.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Facebook and Google for further comment, and will update this piece accordingly.\n\nUntil then, sit back, and try not to download WhatsApp from sketchy sites.\n\nUpdate 12:15 UTC, October 11: A WhatsApp spokesperson contacted TNW to let us know the app is now back up on the Play Store. Unfortunately, the reason for the short absence remains unclear.\n\nWell, at least it\u2019s back up.\n\nPro-tip: you\u2019ll have to restart (close it and open it again) the Google Play to get WhatsApp to show up in search again.\n\nRead next: This company claims it's releasing the first phone to be fully made in Africa", "description": "WhatsApp, one of the world's most popular privacy-oriented messengers, has suddenly disappeared from Google Play \u2014 and nobody knows why.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fwhatsapp-android-google-play-disappear.jpg&signature=3987af024f416cfc3e6660b79fa297b6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
