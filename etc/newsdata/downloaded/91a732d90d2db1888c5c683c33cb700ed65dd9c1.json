Oil rises, buoyed by gains in industrial commodities\n\n* Death toll mounts in Iraq after a week of unrest\n\n* Ecuador may cut output by 59,450 bpd on protests -\n\nministry\n\n* U.S. crude stockpiles may rise for 4th week - poll\n\n\n\nBy Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday,\n\nbuoyed by overnight gains in industrial commodities, while\n\nunrest in oil-producing countries Iraq and Ecuador raised\n\nconcerns of supply disruption, adding to support.\n\nBrent crude rose 39 cents, or 0.7%, to $58.74 a barrel by\n\n0102 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at\n\n$53.10, up 35 cents, or 0.7%.\n\n\"Copper and aluminium traded very strongly in London and\n\ngiven the weakness we saw in manufacturing data last week, that\n\nsuggests that there's some correction going on in industrial\n\ncommodities generally,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market\n\nstrategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\"We're at the lower end of the trading range, some of those\n\nmoves have taken some traders by surprise. That means the risks\n\nhave flipped to the upside at least in the short term.\"\n\nInvestors are treading cautiously before U.S.-China trade\n\ndiscussions that will take place in Washington on Thursday,\n\nalthough expectations are low for a comprehensive deal that will\n\nend a trade war between the world's top economies. Protests in Iraq and Ecuador over poor economic conditions\n\nare threatening to disrupt output from the members of the\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe death toll has climbed after a week of unrest in\n\nBaghdad, capital of the second largest OPEC\n\nproducer. In Ecuador, protests against austerity measures could reduce\n\nthe Andean producer's crude output by 59,450 barrels per day,\n\nthe country's energy ministry said late on Monday. Ecuador, one of the smallest OPEC members, is pulling out of\n\nthe bloc next year because of fiscal problems. In the United States, crude inventories probably grew for a\n\nfourth straight week while distillates and gasoline stocks\n\nlikely fell last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on\n\nMonday. EIA/S\n\nSeparately, Russia, the world's second-largest oil producer,\n\nhas joined the ranks of swing producers as it could increase\n\nproduction fairly quickly by 0.3-0.5 million barrels per day, or\n\n0.3-0.5% of global supply, if Saudi Arabia's production problems\n\nwere to last longer than expected, Russian Energy Minister\n\nAlexander Novak told Reuters. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has resumed\n\nproduction after an attack on its facilities on Sept. 14 cut its\n\noutput by half.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Oil rises, buoyed by gains in industrial commodities", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE5S1ZM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
