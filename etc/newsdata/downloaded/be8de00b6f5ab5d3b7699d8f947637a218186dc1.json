I mean, no one is too small to have an impact.\u201d\n\nThunberg arrived in the United States last month after a two-week voyage across the Atlantic Ocean on a zero-emissions sailboat. (The teenager refuses to take planes.) In New York, she met with fellow school strikers and United Nations officials. In Washington, she has protested outside the White House and received an award from Amnesty International, and she is scheduled to give an address to members of Congress.\n\nThis Friday, the teenager will lead a rally in New York ahead of a United Nations summit on climate action. Hundreds of thousands of youths in at least 150 countries have said they will walk out of school in solidarity with her.\n\nIn a Tuesday tweet sharing the video of their meeting, Obama called Greta \u201cone of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates.\"\n\n\u201cYou and me, we\u2019re a team,\u201d Obama told the teenager during their meeting Monday. (He didn\u2019t specify what they\u2019d teamed up on.) Then he wished her good luck, and, shaking his hand, Greta wished him luck in return.\n\nSeveral of Obama\u2019s environmental policies have been rolled back under President Trump\u2019s administration, most recently a 2015 rule that gave the Environmental Protection Agency broad authority to protect the nation\u2019s waterways.\n\nRead more:\n\nTeen activist Greta Thunberg takes her youth climate campaign to Washington\n\nMost American teens are frightened by climate change, poll finds, and about 1 in 4 are taking action", "description": "He called her \"one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates.\"", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "September At Pm", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
