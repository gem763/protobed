Eli Manning, right, is the new backup. (Michael Hickey/Getty Images)\n\nSooner or later, the New York Giants were going to make the difficult decision to bench Eli Manning and start Daniel Jones.\n\n\u201cSooner\u201d arrived Tuesday, with the team announcing that Jones, the No. 6 pick in April\u2019s NFL draft, would replace the two-time Super Bowl winner for Sunday\u2019s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. For the Giants, winless in their first two games, the decision was announced on a day when players are unavailable to the media.\n\n\u201cEli and I spoke this morning,\u201d Coach Pat Shurmur said, according to the team. \u201cI told him that we are making a change and going with Daniel as the starter. I also talked to Daniel. Eli was obviously disappointed, as you would expect, but he said he would be what he has always been, a good teammate, and continue to prepare to help this team win games. Daniel understands the challenge at hand, and he will be ready to play on Sunday.\u201d\n\nShurmur had on Monday declined to say which man would be his starter, a sign that the end was likely coming for Manning, who will turn 39 in January \u2014 particularly with the Giants 0-2 for the third consecutive season and for the sixth time in the last seven seasons.\n\n[Eli Manning being benched for Daniel Jones was inevitable. The only surprise is the timing.]\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is a move that I felt was best for this team at this time,\u201d Shurmur said Tuesday. \u201cI have said it since I got here, I am very fond of Eli. His work ethic, his preparation, his football intelligence. All those attributes are as good as I have ever seen in a player. And Eli worked as hard as you could ask of anybody to get ready for this season. This move is more about Daniel moving forward than about Eli.\u201d\n\nManning has completed only 62.9 percent of his passes, is averaging only 6.2 yards per attempt and has compiled a 30.0 QBR in two Giants losses. In a loss Sunday to the Buffalo Bills, he threw his first two interceptions of the season and failed to complete a pass in the first quarter for just the third time in his career. Manning was asked Monday if he would be more motivated to improve based on Shurmur\u2019s apparent no-confidence vote.\n\n\u201cThe motivation is to win,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more than that.\u201d\n\nJones completed 25 of 30 passes for 369 yards and two touchdowns during preseason, although he\u2019ll have to navigate the same depleted corps of receivers as Manning. Golden Tate was suspended for the first four games of the season after violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancing drug policy. Sterling Shepard missed Sunday\u2019s game with a concussion, and Cody Latimer suffered a concussion Sunday.\n\nManning\u2019s status as the starter has been threatened before. He was in the midst of a streak of 210 consecutive regular-season starts, second only to Brett Favre, when he was benched in ham-handed fashion by Ben McAdoo two years ago. The decision to go to Geno Smith flabbergasted New Yorkers, who were accustomed to seeing the city\u2019s sports legends handled gently as their careers waned. Manning was left to stand before his locker, explaining that he was given the option of starting to preserve his consecutive-starts streak. The veteran declined, so he was replaced by Smith, a quarterback with 28 touchdown passes and 36 interceptions in 34 games. That experiment lasted all of one game. Manning has been the starter since.\n\n[If Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger can\u2019t stay healthy, good luck to the NFL]\n\nManning, the No. 1 draft pick by the San Diego Chargers in 2004, was traded to the Giants for their fourth overall pick, Philip Rivers. He became the starter in Week 11 of that season. He has started 232 of the Giants\u2019 last 233 regular-season games; Sunday\u2019s loss dropped his record as a starter to 116-116. But he has shined in the playoffs, with an 8-4 record as a postseason starter, including victories in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI. Both times, he was named the game\u2019s most valuable player, making him one of only five players with multiple Super Bowl MVP awards. (Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Bart Starr and Terry Bradshaw are the others.)\n\nManning\u2019s benching comes in the same week that two fellow Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks suffered serious injuries. The Steelers\u2019 Ben Roethlisberger is out for the season with an elbow injury, and the Saints\u2019 Drew Brees is considering whether to have surgery for a thumb injury. This will be the first Sunday since late in 2003 that none of the three men will start an NFL game, according to the league.\n\nOf the 32 presumed NFL starting quarterbacks in Week 3, only four have won a Super Bowl: Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson and Joe Flacco.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nTanking Dolphins trade defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick to the reeling Steelers\n\nChris Smith suits up for Browns game days after his girlfriend\u2019s death, saying \u2018she\u2019s my why\u2019\n\nSally Jenkins: Case Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big\n\nNFL power rankings after Week 2: Cowboys, Ravens move up as other suffer quarterback unrest\n\nBen Roethlisberger out for the season, will have elbow surgery\n\nJohn Clayton: Can any of the NFL\u2019s 0-2 teams make a playoff run?\n\nThe NFL\u2019s pass interference replay rule has brought more confusion than clarity\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you", "description": "The team, winless in its first two games, needs a quick turnaround.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "September At Pm", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
