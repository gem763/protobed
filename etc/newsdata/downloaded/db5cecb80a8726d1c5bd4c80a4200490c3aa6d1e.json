REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India\u2019s foreign minister said on Tuesday that the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan belongs to India and that he expected New Delhi to gain physical control over it one day, as the two countries again traded barbs over the disputed territory.\n\nIndia rules the heavily populated Kashmir Valley, while Pakistan controls a wedge of territory in the west of the region that New Delhi describes as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\n\u201cOur position on PoK is, has always been and will always be very clear. PoK is part of India and we expect one day that we will have the jurisdiction, physical jurisdiction over it,\u201d Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told a news conference.\n\nLast month, New Delhi scrapped the special status of its part of Muslim-majority Kashmir in a bid to integrate the territory fully into India, a move that has prompted protests and anger in Kashmir and Pakistan.\n\nIn a statement, Pakistan\u2019s foreign affairs ministry condemned Jaishankar\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cComing from an occupying state, such irresponsible and belligerent statements have the potential to further escalate tensions and seriously jeopardise peace and security in the region,\u201d it said. \u201cPakistan stands for peace, but would be ready to respond effectively to any act of aggression.\u201d\n\nThe two countries, both nuclear-armed, have twice gone to war over Kashmir. Pakistan has condemned India\u2019s decision to change Kashmir\u2019s status and said India\u2019s crackdown on protests and dissent in the region would drive more of the world\u2019s Muslims into extremism.\n\nJaishankar said the revoking of Kashmir\u2019s special rights was an internal Indian matter.", "description": "India's foreign minister said on Tuesday that the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan belongs to India and that he expected New Delhi to gain physical control over it one day, as the two countries again traded barbs over the disputed territory.", "authors": ["Aftab Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430830608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0WX", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
