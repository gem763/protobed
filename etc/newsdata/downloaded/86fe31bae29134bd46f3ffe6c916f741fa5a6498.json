So you can only imagine how she felt when she failed her driving test.\n\n\"The examiner said to me: 'I can tell you can drive but I\u2019m going to have to fail you because you pulled out in front of a bus at a roundabout.',\" she recalls, looking mortified. \"I was crying, an absolute mess...\"\n\nIt was, thankfully, just a minor set-back. Munnings has already crammed more into her working life than people twice her age. Whereas the vast majority of 21-year-olds are only starting to think about what sort of career they would like to pursue, she has been hugely successful in two very different fields.\n\nAnyone with small children is likely to recognise her as the presenter of the hugely popular CBeebies Show, Catie\u2019s Amazing Machines, although, much to the disappointment of her young fans, she will not be presenting a second series.\n\nIt was a difficult decision, but her true passion has always been rally driving and, in order to try and break into the world rally championship, and with a sponsorship deal with Red Bull on the table, she could no longer juggle the two commitments.", "description": "Catie Munnings is one of British motor sport's most exciting young talents, a rally driver who flings cars around mountain tracks and winding country roads for a living.", "authors": ["Luke Edwards", "James Corrigan", "Maggie Alphonsi"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/sport/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000207612340-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXfJMPfENEq5oPh9E8lUElTlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
