Yesterday, a Group of Seven nations task force threw up another hurdle in a report, stating global stablecoins like Libra could potentially wreck the global monetary system and upend financial stability.\n\nTitled \u201cInvestigating the Impact of Global Stablecoins,\u201d the report is the result of a G7 working group, chaired by Benoit Coeure, a board member of the European Central Bank. \u201cThe G7 believes that no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed, through appropriate designs and by adhering to regulation that is clear and proportionate to the risks,\u201d the report reads.\n\nWhat makes stablecoins different from other cryptocurrencies is that they\u2019re backed by traditional currencies to offset the volatility associated with digital currencies, hence the stable moniker. That said, stablecoins have thus far been limited and remain highly unregulated. In particular, the G7 working group identified that stablecoins could botch attempts to curb money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as present risks to fair competition, cybersecurity, consumer privacy, and taxation.\n\nThe Libra Association\u2014the oversight group in charge of shepherding Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency\u2014also released a statement in response to the G7 report.\n\nIn it, the group tackles the G7's concerns point by point, vowing to work with regulators to address concerns. Because you know, it has to play nice if it wants a shot at ever existing.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the importance of the stability of the global financial system and national sovereignty over monetary policy, Libra is being designed to work with existing regulatory institutions and apply the protections they provide to the digital world\u2014not disrupt or undermine them,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nWhile the G7 report isn\u2019t the final nail in Libra\u2019s coffin, it is a telling sign that global regulators aren\u2019t sold on Facebook\u2019s vision either. That\u2019s already had consequences.\n\nWhen Libra launched back in June, it had 27 companies in its corner, including well-known payments institutions like Visa and Mastercard. But straight out of the gate, the cryptocurrency was met with opposition from the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nThat in turn led to rumours that Libra partners were getting cold feet by late August, with PayPal officially calling it quits in early October.\n\nA few days later, eBay, Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard also jumped ship. Adding salt to the wound, Calibra, the subsidiary running the cryptocurrency is facing a lawsuit alleging its logo was ripped off from Current, a mobile banking app.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on October 23. He\u2019ll likely need to address the many concerns brought up by the G7, as well as the fact that major backers meant to lend Libra credibility have since distanced themselves from the project.\n\nGiven how Zuckerberg\u2019s recent attempts at talking like a human have gone, maybe he\u2019ll be the one to inadvertently put Libra out of its misery.\n\n[Reuters]", "description": "The slow march to death for Libra, Facebook\u2019s forthcoming cryptocurrency, continues.
