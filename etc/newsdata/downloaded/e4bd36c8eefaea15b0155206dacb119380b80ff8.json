The school did not immediately appear threatened.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said the flames consumed about 60 acres in little more than two hours.\n\nMoraga police ordered evacuations in the town\u2019s Sanders Ranch neighborhood. Residents were told to take only essential items.\n\nThe community in Contra Costa County is part of Pacific Gas and Electric\u2019s ongoing pre-emptive electricity shutdowns.\n\nBefore the fire even broke out, much of northern California was facing life without electricity or gas for as many as five to seven days, after the country\u2019s largest utility company cut power to an unprecedented swath of the state as a preventive measure against wildfires.\n\nThe power shutoffs by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) may affect up to 2.5 million people by the end of the week. The first wave of shutoffs began on Wednesday to portions of 20 of the state\u2019s 58 counties. PG&E was expected to shut off power to 10 more later in the day.\n\nSanta Clara county, the home of Silicon Valley, declared a local emergency on Wednesday afternoon in hopes of spurring California to declare a state of emergency.\n\n\u201cIn Santa Clara county alone, 38,250 customers will be affected,\u201d said Miguel M\u00e1rquez, chief operating officer for the county. \u201cOf those customers, 1,100 are what are called medical baseline customers that have special energy needs due to the medical equipment they have.\u201d\n\nSwaths of wine country north of San Francisco, hit hard by wildfires in 2017 , sat in the dark for most of Wednesday, along with the region north of Sacramento devastated by the 2018 Camp fire.\n\nThe power shutoff zone stretched down the Sierra Nevada foothills and along the coast into the far north of the state, with large portions of the Bay Area set to turn off in the evening.\n\nPG&E has a 70,000 square-mile service area, and serves more than a third of the state. The utility declared bankruptcy in January, in part because of potential liabilities from its role in some of the 2017 fires and the Camp fire.\n\nPG&E began practicing preventive shutoffs this year during red flag fire weather conditions \u2013 high winds and low humidity \u2013 after investigators found it at fault in two of the deadliest wildfires in California\u2019s history, both within the past two years.\n\nSome of the wildfires started because of trees falling on power lines \u2013 trees that should have been cleared by PG&E because of their proximity to the lines. In the 2018 Camp fire, which killed 85, the utility\u2019s outdated infrastructure was implicated.\n\nAmid warm temperatures and strong winds, major shutoffs are expected to become a staple in a state gripped by the climate crisis.", "description": "Cal Fire said flames consumed about 60 acres in little more than two hours in the hills of a Bay Area community, Sanders Ranch", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d2d39d2f0dcd8e611137660a37d117ecf84b3f/0_112_5050_3030/master/5050.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d723b94f0875ee0615033c13138e8370", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
