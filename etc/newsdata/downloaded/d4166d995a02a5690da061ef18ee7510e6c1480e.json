Our position is consistent and clear.\u201d\n\nTrump said last week that Ukraine and China should investigate former vice-president Biden and his son, Hunter, and that he [Trump] had \u201ctremendous power\u201d and a \u201clot of options\u201d going into the China-U.S. trade talks.\n\n\u201c[Ukraine] should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed, and all these companies if you look at \u2013 and, by the way, likewise China should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe Republican president, who is subject to an impeachment inquiry in Congress for asking Ukraine\u2019s president to launch the investigation, claimed the Bidens were \u201ccorrupt\u201d but did not provide evidence. Trump had described the impeachment inquiry as \u201cbulls***\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for China to investigate the Bidens came ahead of trade negotiations between the two nations on Thursday and Friday. Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He will lead a delegation with officials from the commerce ministry, central bank, information technology ministry and agricultural ministry for the talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe latest round of talks precedes the U.S.\u2019 imposition of additional tariffs on Chinese products next Tuesday. The Chinese side will seek to determine if the U.S. will postpone the tariffs again.\n\n\u201cThe nature of China-US economic and trade relation is mutually beneficial,\u201d Geng said. \u201cIt is normal that disputes exist. But we have to stick to the basis of mutual respect, equal and mutual benefit in the process of resolving the dispute. I am afraid it is not a correct attitude if someone always wants to maintain an upper hand.\"\n\nDiplomatic observers said the impeachment inquiry would overshadow the trade talks, but Beijing would be unmoved by Trump\u2019s request to investigate the Bidens. In addition to maintaining the non-interference principle, a Chinese investigation into the Bidens would be likely to offend both Democrats and Republicans, further intensifying concerns that China is interfering in U.S. presidential election.\n\nTaoran Notes, the social media account affiliated with state-run Economic Daily, warned that remarks about China meddling in U.S. politics would complicate the trade talks.\n\n\u201cSuch acts are nothing but political blackmail,\u201d the commentary said. \u201cThey know China\u2019s long-held stance of not interfering in other nations\u2019 affairs, so [some people in the U.S.] unscrupulously manipulated related issues, adding further complications to the negotiations.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have criticized Biden for taking his son on the Air Force Two vice presidential jet in 2013 to China, a trip that took place months after the junior Biden became an unpaid board member of an investment fund with a Chinese private equity manager.\n\nHunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He was also on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at a time when the U.S. and Europe were trying to woo Ukraine away from neighbor Russia.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e9/d0/17be4ae74c8c9a4097a2ae7fcbef/191008-geng-shuang-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
