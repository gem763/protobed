Now, The Verge has obtained the first images of what that factory will look like, after they were filed with Casa Grande\u2019s Planning and Developing Department this week.\n\nIt\u2019s... big! And white! Perhaps unsurprisingly it... looks like a factory!\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness, though, Lucid Motors looks has soome 21 million square feet to play with, according to the master site plan filed with the city. But it will start off at this site with 820,000 square feet of factory space. And instead of a gleaming tourist attraction, like Faraday Future once hoped to build outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, this building looks far more appropriate to the needs of a cash-hungry automotive startup that\u2019s trying to get a luxury electric sedan (the Lucid Air) into production by late next year.\n\nLucid Motors doesn\u2019t own the land it will build on; instead, Pinal County bought the nearly 500-acre site and will lease it to the EV startup, with the goal of eventually handing it over. Pinal County raised $29.94 million through bonds to buy the land, and Lucid Motors will pay $1.8 million each year in rent, before being given the opportunity to buy the land in five years.\n\nPinal County and the city of Casa Grande are counting on the factory to provide 3,230 direct and indirect construction jobs over the first five years, according to a third-party economic analysis commissioned in late 2018. Over 20 years, the factory\u2019s expected to generate 4,800 direct and indirect jobs, $33.5 million in tax revenue to the city and county, and $22.2 million in tax revenue to local school districts.\n\nCasa Grande\u2019s economic development director said he expects the company to break ground before the end of this year, according to the Casa Grande Dispatch. Lucid Motors marketing manager David Salguero said the company has started grading the land, but declined to comment any further.", "description": "The Saudi-backed startup is expected to break ground this year on the site in Casa Grande, Arizona where it will build the all-electric Lucid Air sedan.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NT3RWBfqFt_90cBZtR5TbwT3R8o=/0x35:1884x1021/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19239740/Screen_Shot_2019_09_27_at_5.05.53_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
