It was this intrinsic concern.'\n\nNo holds barred: Ali Wong feels 'no topic is off limits - it just depends if I can make it funny'\n\nAli said: 'I didn\u2019t want them to feel like their son married a bad seed - and they didn\u2019t feel that way; they were very supportive.'\n\nShe clarified: 'And there was nothing that would indicate that they would ever think that way, but that\u2019s where my mind immediately went.'\n\nAli, who married tech executive Justin Hakuta in 2014, recorded Netflix stand-up specials during both of her pregnancies.\n\nLetting it out: The 37-year-old comedian covered the new issue of Health and discussed her onstage candor with the magazine\n\n'It was this intrinsic concern': She shared that when she put her miscarriage in her act: 'I remember hoping my husband\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t be disappointed'\n\nWhen the first of them, Baby Cobra, made her a star: 'I was shocked nobody was trying to talk to me about my gender or my race, which I loved. Everyone wanted to talk about me being pregnant and how I spoke about my miscarriage.'\n\nDuring the Baby Cobra miscarriage bit, she joked: 'Don't feel bad, okay? They were the size of poppy seeds. I've picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost.'\n\nWhile discussing the subject with Health, Ali shared that she had already told her loved ones she was pregnant when she miscarried.\n\nLucky: Ali said: 'I didn\u2019t want them to feel like their son married a bad seed - and they didn\u2019t feel that way; they were very supportive'\n\nLooking back: She clarified: 'And there was nothing that would indicate that they would ever think that way, but that\u2019s where my mind immediately went'\n\n'I didn\u2019t realize miscarrying was a thing that could happen. That\u2019s why I told everybody. I told the lady who cleans my house, and when she found out I was seven weeks along, she told me I shouldn\u2019t be telling people,' she said.\n\n'Now I know why. It\u2019s because then you have to tell everyone the bad news. Some people have insensitive reactions. Like, they will ask if it\u2019s because you had sushi or you were performing too much. They want to point to some cause and don\u2019t realize how bad that makes you feel,' Ali remembered.\n\nWhen it comes to material: 'I\u2019ll let my husband veto stuff. It\u2019s not so much about subject choice; it\u2019s about word choice. So no topic is off-limits - it just depends on if I can make it funny. I would love to talk about politics, but I\u2019ve never been able to craft my thoughts into jokes rather than just share anger.'\n\nSide by side: Ali, who married tech executive Justin Hakuta in 2014, recorded a Netflix stand-up special during each of her two pregnancies", "description": "Ali Wong feels 'no topic is off limits - it just depends if I can make it funny.'", "authors": ["Sameer Suri For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19550312-0-image-a-31_1570726225627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
