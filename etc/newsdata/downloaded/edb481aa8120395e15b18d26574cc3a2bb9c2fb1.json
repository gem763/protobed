The cooks and cleaners and construction workers caught the ferry from the Mudd.\n\nThe Mudd, in Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island, was an informal settlement, built with abandoned construction materials on low-lying, flood-prone ground, ravaged periodically by fires. It was an open secret: The rich and famous here were served by \u2014 relied on \u2014 the residents of what the Bahamian government called \u201can unregulated community.\u201d\n\nFor years, wealthy visitors to Baker\u2019s Bay could ignore the precarious living conditions in the Mudd. But now, in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, that\u2019s no longer possible. The shantytown has been destroyed. Many people were killed; the rest are homeless. The devastating human toll has exposed an economic dependency \u2014 there\u2019s no one to repair the mansions.\n\nThe inequality between rich and poor, tourist and worker, was laid bare as the storm approached. When Dorian made landfall on Great Abaco Island as a Category 5 hurricane, the people of Baker\u2019s Bay had cleared out. Its homeowners, almost all seasonal residents with primary homes in the United States or Europe, hired local workers to put up hurricane shutters and prepare for the storm while they tracked it from afar.\n\nBut the Mudd was full. Some residents wanted to stay to guard their homes and belongings. Others \u2014 many of them undocumented Haitians \u2014 fled to local churches for shelter. They said there was little opportunity to leave the island ahead of the storm.\n\nWithin hours, the entire community was flattened. Homes were blown to rubble. At least dozens were killed \u2014 the number climbs as more bodies are found.\n\nIn Baker\u2019s Bay, sturdily built homes lost chunks of roof. Palm trees, evenly spaced along the main road, were toppled over. Debris smashed golf carts.\n\nThe Baker\u2019s Bay Golf & Ocean Club hired a 16-person private security team, equipped with \u00adhelicopters and assault rifles, to protect the property.\n\nTom Brady, who has frequently stayed at Baker\u2019s Bay, posted a link to donate to the recovery effort. Michael Jordan, who has often golfed there, has contributed $1 million.\n\n[Crews in the Bahamas keep finding bodies.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nA portrait of inequality\n\nThe two worlds here \u2014 the ultrawealthy and the vulnerable residents of settlements such as the Mudd \u2014 have coexisted for years. In February, tourists on a catamaran near the coast of Baker\u2019s Bay came upon the bodies of 28 Haitian migrants lured by construction and maintenance jobs whose boat capsized. The Bahamian government, which had long accused Haitians of stealing jobs from locals, repeated long-standing promises to \u201ceradicate\u201d the shantytowns.\n\nMary Boyle, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, owns a second home in Great Guana Cay, not far from Baker\u2019s Bay. She rents it out for more than $1,000 a night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like India with its caste systems,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the white Americans and Canadians and European homeowners, all with different levels of wealth. And then you have the locals.\u201d\n\nNow those two worlds are again uncomfortably linked. To rebuild places like Baker\u2019s Bay, residents know they need the workers of the Mudd to return. But the Mudd is gone. It\u2019s unclear whether it will ever be rebuilt and whether its former residents will return.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put it as raw as I can,\u201d said Glen Kelly, the harbor master at Abaco Beach Resort, one of the largest marinas in the Bahamas. \u201cWe\u2019ve always depended on Haitian labor, legal or illegal, to maintain this place. Now it\u2019s a question of whether they\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nAs Dorian approached, the resort allowed some of its workers to weather the hurricane inside.\n\n\u201cBut eventually we had to turn people away,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough room.\u201d\n\nAt least two employees \u2014 a line chef and a dishwasher \u2014 died in the storm. Their bodies were found in the Mudd. Kelly said it\u2019s unclear whether they were among the workers who were turned away.\n\n[In Dorian\u2019s wake, a shattered town haunted by its missing]\n\n\n\nDamage at Baker\u2019s Bay Golf & Ocean Club. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nA man goes through the debris in the Mudd and Peas neighborhoods. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nOnce a libertarian dream\n\nThe Abaco Islands, which include both Baker\u2019s Bay and the Mudd, have long been a kind of semi-governed area. In the 1970s, a group of mostly white residents started an Abaco Independence Movement to turn the region into a libertarian refuge. The movement failed, but its ethos still pervades the islands.\n\nWhen Discovery Land Co. built the Baker\u2019s Bay Golf & Ocean Club in 2005, the developer found little sign of the government\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cWe literally had to create resources for the people of Abacos,\u201d chief executive Mike Meldman said. \u201cThe infrastructure was nothing.\u201d\n\nEven the islands\u2019 evacuation after the storm was managed partially by private companies, including Baker\u2019s Bay, which hired boats and planes. Now, some of those companies are trying to lure their workers back.\n\nAbaco Beach Resort is at the forefront of that effort. It has a ready new clientele: aid workers who need a place to stay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting hundreds of requests,\u201d said Harvey Moss, the guest experience manager. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting the word out \u2014 who survived, and is willing to come back and work.\u201d\n\nA week after the hurricane destroyed their own homes, some of those workers have already returned. The simple truth: They need to repair other people\u2019s properties so they can fix their own.\n\n\u201cI lost everything,\u201d said Rudolph Ash, 54. \u201cIf I want to make the money to rebuild my house, I need a job.\u201d\n\nAsh used to make $360 a week landscaping at the hotel. Now, he\u2019s sweeping up debris, trying to make the hotel inhabitable.\n\nOn a break, he went back to look for his own home in the Mudd.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\n[In the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, waiting for relief amid the bodies]\n\nThe Baker\u2019s Bay Golf & Ocean Club advertises townhomes for millions of dollars and houses for tens of millions. Members have raised $8 million for the \u201cimmediate disaster relief needs of Bahamian citizens including Baker\u2019s Bay employees.\u201d The goal is $100 million.\n\nBut beyond the humanitarian mission, homeowners and developers acknowledge, there\u2019s also the reality of their own needs: Baker\u2019s Bay and the exclusive enclaves in Great Guana Cay are going to need a huge amount of manual labor to rebuild. Two thousand of the employees on Baker\u2019s Bay came here daily from Marsh Harbor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one there to build now,\u201d Meldman said.\n\nHe said he\u2019s considering docking a \u201cmini-cruise ship\u201d off the coast, where workers can stay while they build more permanent buildings to house some of the club\u2019s workforce.\n\nMany have described the Mudd as a shantytown. Meldman said he wasn\u2019t aware of such conditions.\n\n\u201cI never saw that type of lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe employees and the members were truly a family.\u201d\n\nBoyle, from Ohio, is trying to get her own workers back to help rebuild. She considers it the next step in the symbiotic relationship between Baker\u2019s Bay and the Mudd. She paid her employees as much as $25 an hour, she said, which supported a number of families. She made sure her construction workers had health insurance, she said.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a need for workers, and they know that there will be jobs and money here for them, more than in Nassau,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t let their workers use their bathrooms. I get criticized for being too nice to my workers, but you\u2019ve got to treat a human like a human, or you don\u2019t get good quality work,\u201d she said.\n\n[First, 40 hours of terror. Then they ventured out \u2014 and saw their Bahamas destroyed.]\n\n\n\nA house at Baker\u2019s Bay Golf & Ocean Club after Hurricane Dorian. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nBahamian officials called the Mudd an \u201cunregulated community.\u201d (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nA question of who rebuilds\n\nIn recent years, the government has spoken of razing homes and deporting Haitians in the Mudd \u2014 but not building permanent homes or otherwise improving conditions for thousands of manual laborers.\n\nAfter an earthquake, Hubert Minnis, the Bahamian prime minister, spoke broadly about rebuilding the country, but he has not specifically referred to the Mudd, a community that he once said breaks \u201cevery regulation and law and safety standard in the country.\u201d\n\nFor now, on the islands once imagined as a libertarian utopia, it\u2019s the private developers who have laid out a plan to rebuild the homes of their laborers.\n\n\u201cWe need to create housing, even if it\u2019s temporary, because we don\u2019t want people to leave and not come back,\u201d Meldman said. \u201cWe need their help, and they need jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Abaco Beach Resort has managed to recruit a small team of workers, mostly men whose wives and children were evacuated to Nassau. For now, they\u2019re sleeping in the hotel\u2019s rooms, which are in various states of disrepair.\n\nOne of them was Jack Mentor, 49. On Tuesday morning, he was sweeping up debris.\n\n\u201cI owned my own house in the Mudd,\u201d he said. It had wooden walls, he said, painted yellow, and two bedrooms. He\u2019s committed to rebuilding it so that it can withstand another storm.\n\n\u201cIf I want to build it back, I need to work.\u201d\n\n\n\nJack Mentor, a member of the landscaping staff at Abaco Beach Resort, cleans a room. Mentor sheltered at the hotel during the hurricane. Once it passed, he found his home in the Peas flattened, so he sent his family to Nassau and stayed. He wants to earn money cleaning up so he can rebuild his own home.
