Gavin Newsom and mayors said President Donald Trump should be focused on funding rather than punitive measures. | Richard Vogel/AP Photo Newsom to visiting Trump: Help us on homelessness\n\nA day before President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other elected officials are greeting the president by pushing him to do more on homelessness.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s metastasizing homelessness crisis has been both a leading issue for Newsom and a flashpoint in his contentious relationship with the Trump administration. As Trump has mulled a federal intervention, Newsom has repeatedly implored the president to provide support rather than a crackdown and assailed him for cutting aid.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA letter from Newsom and local leaders reprises that critique, noting that \u201cyour Administration proposed significant cuts\u201d to public housing and community block grants. It asks Trump to increase the number and value of housing vouchers and to launch a program encouraging landlords to connect voucher users with housing.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of a broad, bipartisan coalition of California\u2019s elected mayors, councilmembers and members of county Board of Supervisors, we invite you to collaborate with us on solutions \u2014 tied to federal investments \u2014 to address homelessness and housing insecurity,\u201d says the letter to Trump, which was also signed by Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg and the respective heads of the California League of Cities and the California State Association of Counties.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to work in partnership with you to address this crisis with serious solutions that will actually help Veterans and other at-risk Americans exit homelessness,\u201d the letter concludes.\n\nIn public comments on Monday, Newsom said the \u201cunprecedented\u201d letter fleshed out requests \u201cnot with a clenched fist, but with an open hand.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump will be in California to fundraise, his administration last week dispatched a team to learn about homelessness in Los Angeles. After The Washington Post reported that the administration was contemplating razing encampments or pushing homeless people into federal facilities, Newsom and mayors said Trump should be focused on funding rather than punitive measures.\n\nU.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is set to visit California this week as well. A spokesperson did not respond to questions about Carson\u2019s agenda; Newsom said, \u201cI would hope that Ben Carson would read our letter\u201d and \u201cconsider the core request\" around vouchers.\n\n\u201cThe president and secretary Carson have the ability this week by executive fiat\u201d to make a major dent in the numbers of homeless people, Newsom said.", "description": "California\u2019s homelessness crisis has been both a leading issue for Newsom and a flashpoint in his contentious relationship with the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
