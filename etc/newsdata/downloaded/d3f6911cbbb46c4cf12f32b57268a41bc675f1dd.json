The subscription price won't be raised as part of the new agreement, he added.\n\n\"We wanted to simplify this convoluted world of so many offerings,\" Lennox said in an interview with The Canadian Press.\n\n\"Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon are inarguably ubiquitous goliaths \u2014 but when you add all this content... to the already substantial Crave offering, I really do believe we compete on the world stage.\"\n\nDenis Villeneuve's Dune included, but not Friends\n\nUpcoming titles in the HBO Max deal, which takes effect next year, include a spinoff of Gossip Girl, DC Comics series Green Lantern, and Dune: The Sisterhood, a project from Quebec director Denis Villeneuve that's set in the universe of Frank Herbert's Dune novels.\n\nBut not everything on HBO Max will be mirrored in Canada, since the agreement only covers output from Warner's television production operations.\n\nGame of Thrones is among the legacy HBO programming Canadians will see on Crave, but the deal doesn't cover other HBO Max content such as Sesame Street or Friends. (Bell Media/HBO)\n\nThat means certain TV shows produced by other companies will be excluded, among them Sony's update to the cult animated series The Boondocks, and Sesame Street, which has a U.S. deal with HBO Max for both past and upcoming seasons.\n\nWildly popular 1990s sitcom Friends was confirmed to be leaving Netflix for the HBO Max service in the United States, but won't be making that same leap in Canada. And Japanese animated films made by Studio Ghibli, including Oscar winner Spirited Away, aren't part of the deal either.\n\nLennox said the selection available through Crave's HBO package more than compensates for the missing programs.\n\nViewers will have access to HBO titles Game of Thrones and Succession and Hollywood movies Green Book and Crazy Rich Asians, as well as the basic tier of Crave, which features Showtime's cable programs and classic network TV hits Seinfeld and Big Bang Theory.\n\nExclusive content has become a valuable asset for all of the major streaming players, who have invested billions of dollars in producing new shows and films to attract more subscribers and retain their current ones.\n\nNetflix heads into the final months of the year with its strongest roster of potential awards contenders yet, including the Martin Scorsese drama The Irishman and Scarlett Johansson-Adam Driver divorce dramedy Marriage Story in an effort to reinforce its dominance. Amazon makes a similar play for accolades with the Driver's CIA whistleblower thriller The Report.\n\nThose films will be trying to wrestle attention away from the star-studded TV lineup debuting Nov. 1 on Apple TV Plus, and the extensive selection of family-oriented programs making their way to Disney Plus on Nov. 12.\n\nUnder the HBO Max contract, Bell also renewed its first-run rights for Warner Bros. feature films, which include recent blockbuster hits Joker and It Chapter Two.", "description": "As the battle for TV viewers intensifies, Bell Media says it's struck an agreement for the exclusive Canadian rights of original series made for the upcoming U.S. streaming platform HBO Max.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340690.1572438776!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tv-bell-media-hbo-max-20191030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
