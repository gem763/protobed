His answer on age was effective, and he avoided a prolonged exchange focused on his son\u2019s unseemly, foreign employment situations. But his lack of energy over three hours didn\u2019t back it up. That he ended the third fundraising quarter with less money on hand than Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Harris is yet another concern for his seemingly plateauing campaign.\n\nAdam Cancryn, health care reporter: The knives finally came out for Elizabeth Warren, and she ably parried them away across all three hours of the debate. Warren demonstrated she can handle the pressure that comes with being the frontrunner, even if it wasn\u2019t always comfortable or particularly easy. And she did take some hits: from Buttigieg on Medicare for All, Andrew Yang on workforce automation and Klobuchar on nearly everything, all of which could open up fresh lines of attack down the road. But on Tuesday, Warren managed to minimize her weaknesses and turn those criticisms more often than not into opportunities to promote her range of policy platforms.\n\nPutting 12 candidates on one stage means some are bound to get lost in the fray, and that was certainly the case for fringe candidates like Juli\u00e1n Castro and Tom Steyer. Both Castro and Steyer had some solid moments, particularly on impeachment and gun control. But they simply didn\u2019t command the stage for long enough \u2014 and notably enough \u2014 to make much of a dent in a debate that centered largely on the established 2020 frontrunners.\n\nNatasha Korecki, national political correspondent: Amy Klobuchar broke out in a way that she hasn\u2019t in past debates and at a time when more centrist Democrats are perhaps considering an alternative to Joe Biden. This could have been a big night for Biden, between Syria and Trump\u2019s recent attacks, but he just couldn\u2019t execute.\n\nBut Elizabeth Warren moved into clear frontrunner status, as evidenced by the attacks on her all night. She dominated talking time and framed her answers in the kind of clear manner that Biden could not when the knives were out for him in earlier debates.\n\nDavid Siders, national political correspondent: Elizabeth Warren won this debate, Joe Biden lost it \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t even close. Yes, Warren once again ducked questions about whether her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal would require a tax increase on Americans. But she\u2019s been dodging that question forever, to no noticeable effect. The difference on Tuesday was that nearly every other candidate was targeting Warren \u2014 on issues ranging from health care to whether President Donald Trump should keep his Twitter account. The effect was to keep Warren firmly at the center of the stage, giving her time to counter every attack. And Warren is a skilled debater, turning issue after issue to her critique of money in politics and inequality in the United States.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/1a/24/c2759c964961ba638ee9d87ffee6/elizabethwarren.png\"\n\nBiden didn\u2019t falter because he performed exceedingly poorly. He turned in a middling debate. But for the first time, expectations were higher for him Tuesday, with the Ukraine controversy and Warren crowding him at the top of public opinion polls. For a candidate who rests his entire candidacy on his ability to confront Trump, his answer on impeachment fell flat.\n\nDaniel Strauss, campaign reporter: Sen. Elizabeth Warren had a good night because this debate showed that other candidates regard her as the one they have to knock down. Warren\u2019s rivals were more eager to attack her than Biden, a clear sign they view her as the more important target.\n\nIt was a bad night for Tulsi Gabbard. After failing to qualify for the last debate, her return to the stage may be short-lived. She\u2019s not assured a spot in the next debate \u2014 and did little Tuesday to change broaden her appeal.\n\nNahal Toosi, foreign affairs correspondent: I thought Pete Buttigieg had a strong night. His criticism of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeast Syria seemed genuinely heartfelt and even indignant. He seemed passionate, not canned as he sometimes does on other topics.\n\nOn that same front, I\u2019d say the weakest candidates were the ones who got less time on the air, like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro. They simply couldn\u2019t stand out. One exception to that: Tom Steyer. In the short amount of time he had, the billionaire making his debate debut made sure to mention climate change as a national security issue, a message not heard often enough.\n\nWhat surprised you?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Klobuchar was at her best when she challenged her opponents on the left, something that has tripped up her and others in the first three debates. Sanders bounced back after a heart attack, again taking it to Biden over his support for the Iraq War. The pending endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ended a serviceable return for Sanders \u2014 who, for whatever you might think about him, is the most authentic figure in the field.\n\nAdam Cancryn: Klobuchar came out with a looseness and passion we haven\u2019t yet seen from her \u2014 or really any moderate Democrat during the debates, save for Buttigieg. She made the kind of positive case for pragmatism that\u2019s been in short supply this primary, while showing she\u2019s not afraid to challenge the soaring ambitions of Warren and Sanders on both politics and policy.\n\nNatasha Korecki: Buttigieg\u2019s face off with O\u2019Rourke \u2014 not because of the clash but Buttigieg\u2019s seemingly deeply personal exchange with the Texas congressman. \u201cI don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg sniped at the Texan. It\u2019s perhaps a testament to Buttigieg still feeling the need to draw a distinction with O\u2019Rourke.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/4b/69/3d9fa8864c10b3652c715b6e7861/pete-beto.png\"\n\nDavid Siders: Klobuchar, after drifting through three debates as a relative non-factor, in one night became a credible alternative to Joe Biden in the moderate lane. Her criticism of Warren on Medicare for All was some of the sharpest offered, and she landed one of the more memorable, off-the-cuff lines of the debate when she gave Warren what she called a \u201creality check.\u201d She said, \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nDaniel Strauss: I was surprised that Buttigieg decided to engage with Gabbard, the only other veteran on stage. Her base in the primary is small, and her supporters are not likely to cross over to him. But he decided to get into a heated exchange with her on Syria and the Middle East anyway.\n\nNahal Toosi: I was surprised that Warren did not specifically name Biden at all in crediting former President Barack Obama and others for supporting the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He pointed out that he helped get votes for it, and she blew him off in a way that I think some people will see as lacking in grace.\n\nDid we learn anything new?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Tom Steyer has spent more than a decade practicing for his moment, since plunging into politics in California. For a first-time debater, and with all the necessary caveats, Steyer managed to hold his own. \u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor,\u201d Steyer said in his most memorable exchange, where he agreed with Sanders, the candidate who doesn\u2019t think billionaires should exist. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely wrong. It\u2019s absolutely undemocratic and unfair,\u201d Steyer added, pointing to his early floating of a wealth tax.\n\nAdam Cancryn: Four debates in, a handful of candidates are ready to stop being polite and start getting real. Warren, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all showed a willingness to throw particularly sharp elbows when challenged, even as Democrats more broadly are pleading for the field to keep focused on defeating Trump. While there was plenty of Trump-bashing during the debate, Warren showed little willingness to entertain criticisms of her policy prescriptions. And Buttigieg and Klobuchar made firm cases for joining Biden as standard bearers for Democrats\u2019 moderate wing.\n\nNatasha Korecki: We saw how Warren took her punches; there were a lot of them tonight and many were coming from the right: Klobuchar and Buttigieg. She\u2019s going to get more questions on her plans, whether she can pay for them and if they\u2019re too pie-in-the-sky. But in the end she stood her ground while Biden faded.\n\nDavid Siders: Sanders is here to stay. This isn\u2019t startling, given his strong fundraising and relatively firm base of support. But it\u2019s possible that he is now a better candidate than he was before his heart attack. No gravelly voice tonight, as there was in the September debate. And he appears ready for a fight, as when he told Biden, \u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend: You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.\u201d\n\nDaniel Strauss: We learned that Sanders does indeed seem fine after his recent heart attack. He was back to his usual self, and now the oldest candidate in the field can pitch himself as the comeback kid.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3882/1155968404_6095140323001_6095137944001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nNahal Toosi: Cory Booker is a vegan. (I\u2019m kidding.) I can\u2019t say on the foreign affairs front that I learned much new. Despite the leftist views of some candidates, such as Sanders, at the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot of unanimity on the basic idea that the U.S. needs to have a presence on the global stage, maintain alliances and project consistency in its foreign policy. Easier said than done, I know.\n\nHow did the moderators do?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: The moderators mostly kept things moving. And, unlike in past debates, the questions setting up confrontations between candidates elicited some sharp contrasts. The final question off of Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush\u2019s unlikely friendship, however, evoked some of the most blatantly inauthentic and cringey politicking of the night.\n\nAdam Cancryn: The moderators will undoubtedly \u2014 and somewhat deservedly \u2014 take some flak from the left for asking questions that parroted Republican attacks on Medicare for All as too costly, liberal jobs programs as unrealistic and the concept of a wealth tax as demonizing the rich. But overall, they did a competent job managing the discussion and should get major credit for hitting subjects like abortion rights and the Supreme Court that had gone totally ignored in prior debates.\n\nNatasha Korecki: The moderators handled the age question tastefully, and that\u2019s no easy task. They could have reined in candidate answers and kept them on task, especially early on when candidates at times shifted and talked about what they wished.\n\nDavid Siders: The moderators controlled the conversation and hit a range of issues that lots of viewers will be happy with. But there was one missed opportunity: When questioning Warren about whether her Medicare for All proposal would require a tax increase, she ducked. The moderators followed up, checking the responsible moderator box. But given Warren\u2019s elevated standing in the race, this is one question where they could have kept going back to it to force the point.\n\nDaniel Strauss: They were fine until the very end with that unlikely friend question. There was nothing useful viewers could learn from that question. It was just a chance for each candidate to filibuster for a little bit.\n\nNahal Toosi: The moderators kept things under control for the most part, and they moved from subject to subject fairly efficiently. The decision to eliminate opening statements struck me as wise, and it was nice to see so many topics covered, though foreign policy deserved more time. Honestly, I was pretty impressed. (And I liked the last question about uncommon friendships. It made the candidates seem human.)\n\nWho had the most cringe-worthy moment?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Harris\u2019 pressing of Warren over suspending Trump\u2019s Twitter account may be the stuff of successful cable news segments \u2014 and, hell, a lot of Democrats likely agree with her given the violence he\u2019s incited. But it looked comparatively trivial on a presidential debate stage. Warren\u2019s refusal to agree magnified the awkwardness. Booker\u2019s \u201cWest Wing\u201d-inspired soliloquy came off as tone deaf given the era and the stakes.\n\nAdam Cancryn: Booker and Gabbard trying to jump in on the inevitable \u201cage\u201d question came off as completely contrived and was painful to watch in real time. Biden, meanwhile, struggled at times to come up with answers to Supreme Court-related questions that didn\u2019t name-check Robert Bork \u2014 a failed Supreme Court nominee from more than 30 years ago who likely isn\u2019t going to register with a wide swath of the electorate.\n\nNatasha Korecki: The heated exchange between Biden and Warren over Warren\u2019s push to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had more than one awkward moment. First, Warren\u2019s response to Biden interjecting that she did a good job of doing her job; she calmly thanked him. But it was equally awkward when Warren very obviously dissed Biden when she personally thanked Obama and purposely refrained from praising the former vice president who had just said he fought for votes for her. There\u2019s likely more of a story there, but it isn\u2019t clear that most viewers would get that.\n\nDavid Siders: Booker sounded all night as though he had a bag of one-liners he needed to empty. His assertion of his qualifications as \u201cthe vegan\u201d on stage to assess Trump\u2019s health \u2014 \u201cthe most unhealthy person running\u201d for president \u2014 was probably the pinnacle.\n\nDaniel Strauss: Harris and Gabbard, separately, pressed Elizabeth Warren to say something, and Warren didn\u2019t take the bait either time. Did they actually think she would? The result both times was just a lot of crosstalk.\n\nNahal Toosi: Gabbard kept using the phrase \u201cregime-change wars.\u201d I understand what she\u2019s trying to get at \u2014 the idea that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t engage in overthrowing other governments \u2014 but the phrase is clunky and awkward. And when she says a phrase like that in the context of questions about Syria, it\u2019s misleading. U.S. troops in Syria have been fighting the Islamic State terrorist group, not the regime of Bashar Assad.\n\nHow will this change the trajectory of the race?\n\nChristopher Cadelago: Several candidates have now established and broken the seal on lines of attack against Warren. Given her steady ascent, you can expect to hear a lot more of these types of attacks in the coming weeks as she faces the stress test of a frontrunner.\n\nAdam Cancryn: Warren is now the clear frontrunner \u2014 and the prime target for the rest of the field. She faced tough questions about her range of policy proposals, and those attacks are only likely to increase as Buttigieg, Klobuchar and other moderate candidates try to gain traction. Biden, meanwhile, faces yet another stretch where he\u2019ll need to prove he\u2019s not just the best Democrat to take on Trump, but the best Democrat to lead the nation beyond the era of Trump.\n\nNatasha Korecki: Biden faded tonight as Warren stepped into the limelight. We got a glimpse into the future: It won\u2019t necessarily be an easy ride for Warren. Two aggressive and articulate candidates \u2014 Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2014 are around to fact-check Warren and ask her to show her work.\n\nDavid Siders: For candidates outside of the top three, Warren is now the candidate to smack \u2014 not necessarily to draw support away from Warren, but to position her as a foil. The real play for moderates is still to hope that Biden collapses. What the debate showed is that if he does, the path to winning over his supporters runs right through a sharp critique of Warren and the liberal left.\n\nDaniel Strauss: Warren\u2019s exchange with Biden on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could provide a window into how other Democrats can navigate Biden\u2019s role in the Obama administration.\n\nNahal Toosi: If this debate, and the run up to it, have been any indication, Warren is now the frontrunner, and Joe Biden is fading. He didn\u2019t really reverse that perception Tuesday night.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/39/05/1ecb76744e318a065a9feb349e6b/191015-debate-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
