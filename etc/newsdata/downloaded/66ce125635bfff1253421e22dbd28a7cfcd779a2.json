Devin Nunes has been providing conservative politicians and journalists with information\u2014and misinformation\u2014about the anonymous whistleblower who triggered the biggest crisis of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, two knowledgeable sources tell The Daily Beast.\n\nDerek Harvey, who works for Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House intelligence committee, has provided notes for House Republicans identifying the whistleblower\u2019s name ahead of the high-profile depositions of Trump administration appointees and civil servants in the impeachment inquiry. The purpose of the notes, one source said, is to get the whistleblower\u2019s name into the record of the proceedings, which committee chairman Adam Schiff has pledged to eventually release. In other words: it\u2019s an attempt to out the anonymous official who helped trigger the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Saturday, The Washington Post reported that GOP lawmakers and staffers have \u201crepeatedly\u201d used a name purporting to be the whistleblower during the depositions. The paper named Harvey as driving lines of questioning Democrats saw as attempting to determine the political loyalties of witnesses before the inquiry. A former official told the Post that Harvey \u201cwas passing notes [to GOP lawmakers] the entire time\u201d ex-NSC Russia staffer Fiona Hill testified.\n\n\u201cExposing the identity of the whistleblower and attacking our client would do nothing to undercut the validity of the complaint\u2019s allegations,\u201d said Mark Zaid, one of the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys. \u201cWhat it would do, however, is put that individual and their family at risk of harm. Perhaps more important, it would deter future whistleblowers from coming forward in subsequent administrations, Democratic or Republican.\u201d Zaid has represented The Daily Beast in freedom-of-information lawsuits against the federal government.\n\nMore Potential Whistleblowers Are Contacting Congress\n\nThe whistleblower is not Harvey\u2019s only target. Another is a staffer for the House intelligence committee Democrats whom The Daily Beast has agreed not to name due to concerns about reprisals against the staffer. Harvey, both sources said, has spread a false story alleging that the whistleblower contacted the staffer ahead of raising internal alarm about President Trump\u2019s July 25th phone call attempting to get a \u201cfavor\u201d from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to damage Trump\u2019s rival Joe Biden. In right-wing circles, contact with Schiff is meant to discredit the whistleblower as partisan.\n\nThe eagerness of Republicans to go after the intelligence committee staffer so alarmed Democrats that they raised the issue with GOP leadership, according to a senior official on the intelligence committee.\n\nPhoto Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty More\n\n\u201cWe are aware of these unsupported and false attacks on a respected member of our staff,\u201d the official told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt is completely inappropriate, and we have previously urged the Republican leadership to address this situation.\u201d\n\nThe official would not comment on any aspect of the depositions\u2019 proceedings.\n\nTrump, who has called the whistleblower treasonous, has speculated baselessly that Schiff is the source of the whistleblower\u2019s account of the Zelensky call, even though Schiff was not on the call and Trump\u2019s own summary of the call corroborated the whistleblower\u2019s second-hand account.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos GettyA top aide to Rep.
