If an individual is assessed to be vulnerable to radicalisation, they may be offered support through the Channel programme in England and Wales, or the Prevent Professional Concerns (PPC) programme in Scotland. This is a voluntary process.\n\nChannel is run in every local authority in England and Wales and addresses all types of extremism, including extreme rightwing and Islamist-related.\n\n'My son was terrified': how Prevent alienates UK Muslims Read more\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but only 394 were escalated to the Channel process.\n\nThere are other aspects to the Prevent strategy. For example, the strategy says the government seeks to stop the spreading of terrorist material online as well as build counter-terrorist narratives. In 2016, the Guardian revealed the UK government had embarked on a series of clandestine propaganda campaigns intended to bring about \u201cattitudinal and behavioural change\u201d among young British Muslims.\n\nWhy is Prevent controversial?\n\nThe most common criticism levelled at the Prevent strategy is that it disproportionately impacts people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression.\n\nThere have been numerous reports over the last 15 years that have fuelled this perception: an eight-year-old questioned by Prevent after his teachers mistook his T-shirt slogan for Islamic State propaganda, a 17-year-old referred because he wore a \u201cFree Palestine\u201d badge to school and a student of counter-terrorism questioned after an official spotted him reading a textbook entitled Terrorism Studies.\n\nThe Prevent brand has been labelled \u201ctoxic\u201d in parts of the Muslim community. But senior policing and security figures continue to back Prevent. The UK\u2019s most senior counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, vigorously defended the programme in a speech in Israel last month, while security ministers and former home secretaries have insisted it has saved lives.", "description": "How does UK\u2019s controversial anti-radicalisation programme work and why is it criticised", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47c05619e147492a1d624f180e74a9d74aa0c6a/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=acf5b261041b90f66b3c66e3d017b8c1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
