They shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against, or subject to any type of violence, or denied any rights, and that\u2019s something I feel very strongly about.\u201d\n\nHe said the center\u2019s priorities include promoting its work in defense of Israel and opposing anti-Semitism \u201cfrom the far left and far right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of things \u2014 Korea, China, the Iran nuclear program, cybersecurity,\u201d Mr. Fleitz said. \u201cAnd we have talked about radical Islam, and that\u2019s just too politically incorrect for the left. They go after anybody who talks about this.\u201d\n\nMr. Fleitz, who served last year as chief of staff to then-National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, said the Nov. 23 banquet is still scheduled for Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMr. Trump no longer runs the Trump Organization \u2014 his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump took over after the 2016 presidential election \u2014 but the episode illustrates how Trump properties such as Mar-a-Lago and Trump National Doral have been pulled into the political fray by the right and left and even the president.\n\nMr. Trump late Saturday reversed his plans to hold the Group of Seven economic summit at Trump National Doral in Doral, Florida, after outcry over profiting from a federal contract. He fumed that it would have been \u201cthe best G-7 ever.\u201d\n\nMar-a-Lago offered no explanation for the cancellation of the Nov. 7 ACT for America gala but told CNN, \u201cThis event will absolutely not be taking place at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d The Washington Times has reached out to the resort for comment.\n\nMs. Malkin blasted CAIR and the SPLC for seeking to \u201csilence & eliminate political opponents by redefining criticism of their agenda & tactics as \u2018hate.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a chilling \u2018cancel culture\u2019 being waged on patriotic journalists & activists\u2014and apparently not even Mar A Lago is a safe space,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nTHREAD: Statement: I am disappointed at the cancellation of my 11/7 speech at @ACTforAmerica \u2018s annual banquet, but I will not be deterred. There is a chilling \u201ccancel culture\u201d campaign being waged against patriotic journalists & activists \u2014 /1 \u2014 Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) October 7, 2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Radical left smear machine\u2019\n\nThe Trump venue canceled the gala amid a longtime feud between CAIR and ACT for America. CAIR has accused the conservative group of \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d which ACT denies, while ACT has blasted CAIR as a \u201cterrorist organization,\u201d which CAIR denies.\n\nDespite the cancellation, Brigitte Gabriel, founder and chairman of ACT for America, said her organization would \u201ccontinue to stand with President Trump and support his fight for the soul of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe radical left smear machine like the SPLC, CAIR and the fake news media will lie, twist the truth, and take words out of context in order to destroy those with whom they disagree,\u201d Ms. Gabriel said in an Oct. 7 statement. \u201cWhile we are disappointed with the Trump Organization attorneys, we do not blame President Trump or the Trump family.\u201d\n\nCAIR and the SPLC cited Ms. Gabriel\u2019s statement at a 2007 anti-terrorism training event at the Defense Department\u2019s Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, where she said that a \u201cpracticing Muslim who believes in the teachings of the Koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a group that has been associated with Islamophobia in the worst form for many years and has also been associated with white supremacists and racist groups,\u201d CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said in an Oct. 5 statement.\n\nIn an Oct. 14 interview with PJ Media, Ms. Gabriel said the 2007 quote was part of a longer exchange that referred to any Muslim who \u201cadheres to the same ideology that al Qaeda \u2026 follows.\u201d\n\nACT for America grassroots director Thomas Hern said the group condemns \u201cwhite supremacy in all forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of @securefreedom\u2019s recent efforts to fight anti-Semitism & I\u2019m very disappointed that I repeatedly discussed this crucial program with numerous reporters, including @nytimes, and they refused to mention it,\u201d @FredFleitz told @PJMedia_com https://t.co/v93U0W4S9Z \u2014 Tyler O\u2019Neil (@Tyler2ONeil) October 18, 2019\n\n\n\nThe call to cancel the Center for Security Policy event focused on founder Frank Gaffney. In a Thursday press release, CAIR said the center was \u201cheaded by notorious Islamophobe Frank Gaffney,\u201d prompting Mr. Fleitz to point out that he heads the group. Mr. Gaffney serves as executive chairman.\n\n\u201cFrank Gaffney\u2019s not the president. I\u2019m the president. And CAIR knows that. I\u2019ve fought with CAIR for years. CAIR doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. This is a lie, this statement,\u201d Mr. Fleitz said.\n\nThe Center for Security Policy and ACT for America are listed as \u201chate groups\u201d by the SPLC, a designation decried on the right as a tactic to discredit leading conservative groups by lumping them with racist outfits such as the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe SPLC has faced heavy criticism for its aggressive fundraising, lavish headquarters and offshore accounts, as well as accusations of racial discrimination against its leadership. Co-founder Morris Dees was fired in March amid sexual harassment allegations, which he denies, and President Richard Cohen resigned two weeks later.\n\nMeanwhile, CAIR plans to celebrate its 25th anniversary with a Nov. 9 gala featuring two controversial figures: Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat, whose first term in Congress has been marred by allegations of anti-Semitism, and activist Linda Sarsour, who famously hugged convicted Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh at a farewell event shortly before she was deported in 2017.\n\nThe CAIR event won\u2019t be at a Trump property, but rather the Grand Hyatt Washington in the District of Columbia.\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
