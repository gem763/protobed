Guterres wants the rise in global temperatures to be limited to the Paris Agreement\u2019s more ambitious 1.5 degrees Celsius target in this century, for the world to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050 and for a 45 percent reduction in emissions by 2030.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely essential that countries commit themselves to increase what was promised in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause what was promised in Paris is not enough and what was promised in Paris is not even being implemented at the present moment. We need more ambition. We need a stronger commitment.\u201d\n\nGuterres spoke in the wake of the World Meteorological Organization finding that July was possibly the world's hottest month on record.\n\nTrump\u2019s lack of interest in the broad multilateral environmental agenda was on full display Monday.\n\nBut there\u2019s little sign that the G7 will form a common front.\n\nAfter years of fraught summits with Trump, this time his fellow world leaders decided it wasn\u2019t worth fighting with him \u2014 and concluded their meeting in Biarritz without a common communiqu\u00e9. The brief final declaration doesn't mention climate or the environment.\n\nThe leaders also didn't bother to dissuade Trump from his plan to drop out of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u201cWe know his position \u2026 and at the G7 we did not have [an] objective to convince him to return,\u201d said French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nGuterres didn't single out the famously prickly Trump for criticism, instead saying he was relying on U.S. states, the American public, businesses and civil society to galvanize support for his goals.\n\nAWOL\n\nTrump\u2019s lack of interest in the broad multilateral environmental agenda was on full display Monday. He was the only G7 leader not to bother turning up for a morning session devoted to climate change and the environment. Macron downplayed the significance of his absence.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump had several bilateral meetings \u2026 that meant he wasn\u2019t in the room, but his team was there,\u201d Macron said, adding that he spoke \u201cat length\u201d about the situation of the forest fires in the Amazon with Trump and \u201che shares the objective I have.\u201d The G7 agreed to set up a $20 million fund to help fight the fires.\n\nTrump explained his absence by saying he was meeting with leaders from Germany and India \u2014 both of whom were at the environment session.\n\nDuring the closing G7 press conference, Trump stressed that he\u2019s an \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d who wants \u201cthe cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air on Earth ... I think I know more about the environment than most people.\u201d\n\nBut he also said he wants the U.S. to cash in on its \u201ctremendous\u201d energy resources. \u201cI am not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills which frankly aren\u2019t working too well.\u201d\n\nMacron has made the Paris Agreement a key part of his presidency's environmental policy \u2014 a point of pride for France which hosted the 2015 summit and helped pull together the final deal. France and other climate allies are investing diplomatic effort into boosting the number of countries committed to cutting emissions to net zero by mid-century, Macron said.\n\n\u201cOthers are strengthening their commitments,\u201d he said pointing to major polluters such as Russia, China and India.\n\nThe U.N. secretary-general is trying to drum up support for more aggressive climate action ahead of a U.N. climate summit taking place in New York on September 23. He has appointed Macron and Jamaica\u2019s Prime Minister Andrew Holness to lead efforts to mobilize climate change financing for developing nations.\n\n\u201cThe G7 was an excellent opportunity to appeal for a very strong engagement of the international community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe youth have been leading the way. We will start the summit with a Youth Climate Summit in the U.N. but we need especially those countries that belong to the G7 to give a positive example.\u201d\n\nAs an example of the damage being caused by global warming, Guterres pointed to Greenland \u2014 which Trump talked of buying last week \u2014 saying: \u201cIf one looks at Greenland, the second-largest ice cap, Greenland is melting dramatically \u2014 179 billion tons of ice melted during the month of July.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure if all world leaders appreciate the magnitude of the climate crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article has been updated to include the final G7 declaration.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
