The anonymous massage therapist filed suit in September 2018, alleging that Spacey had forced him to grab Spacey\u2019s genitals and tried to kiss him during a session in Malibu.\n\nSpacey\u2019s attorneys filed a notice in federal court on Tuesday stating that the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys notified them on Sept. 11 that their client had \u201crecently passed.\u201d\n\nThe cause of death has been described as cancer, though that was not disclosed in the filing.\n\nSpacey was also accused of groping a busboy at a restaurant in Nantucket in 2016. That allegation resulted in a civil suit and a criminal charge, but both were dropped earlier this summer after the accuser pleaded the 5th Amendment during an evidentiary hearing. In that case, Spacey\u2019s attorney alleged that the boy and his mother had altered text messages before turning them over to the police.\n\nSpacey still faces an investigation in London.\n\nIn the Malibu case, the civil trial was supposed to take place on June 23, 2020, in federal court. Last month, the accuser\u2019s attorneys revealed that they would call two other unnamed massage therapists who alleged that they were also victimized by Spacey. The two accusers were said to be afraid to reveal their names publicly.\n\nSpacey\u2019s attorneys vehemently denied wrongdoing, and said that the accuser had failed to substantiate his allegations or even specify when and where the alleged assault occurred.\n\nUpdate: The accuser\u2019s attorney, Genie Harrison, is blasting Spacey\u2019s counsel for filing the notice with the court, saying they did so to gain a tactical advantage. Harrison did not identify the accuser or give additional information about his death. She says \u201chis fight for justice is still very much alive.\u201d\n\nI regret being forced to respond to Kevin Spacey\u2019s undignified, insensitive and inappropriate public filing of the notice of death of our client, John Doe. It is true that Mr. Doe recently died. His untimely death was, to his family, a devastating shock that they are struggling to process and is so recent that they have not yet held his funeral service.\n\nOut of professional responsibility, we notified Spacey\u2019s counsel of Mr. Doe\u2019s passing. We explained our intent to allow his family more time to get past their immediate, paralyzing grief and begin settling his affairs before we filed a death notice with the court \u2014 which is our prerogative as his counsel. Spacey ignored our request for compassion and filed the notice yesterday without our consent.\n\nWhile there is no court deadline for filing a party\u2019s death notice, filing triggers a 90-day countdown. That means that unless the estate is substituted in the party\u2019s place, the court may dismiss the case.\n\nFiling the notice yesterday was unnecessary and contemptible. I\u2019m not surprised, however, that Spacey prematurely filed the notice in an attempt to gain the advantage of a ticking clock. Mr. Doe\u2019s family must now open his estate at the same time as planning a funeral and processing their grief.\n\nMr. Doe was a dignified, kind, middle-aged man traumatized by Spacey\u2019s alleged sexually depraved attack. As a result of this case, other victims from around the world have reached out to our firm. Mr. Doe believed their harrowing stories, and in his final months he looked forward to standing up for all of them. His fight for justice is still very much alive.\n\nMy firm grieves the loss of Mr. Doe, who was truly a wonderful client and human being. He brought light and love every time he visited our office, and we were lucky to know him.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
