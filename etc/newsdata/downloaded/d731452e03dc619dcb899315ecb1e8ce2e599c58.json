However, that now appears to be impossible unless he can force an election, win a majority, and overturn the law preventing a no-deal exit in October.\n\nThe problem is that the opposition Labour party is wary of agreeing to Johnson's demands for an October election and want to hold one after he has been forced to ask Brussels for an extension, a move which the prime minister fiercely opposes and could hugely damage his standing in the polls.\n\nBebb, who supports a second EU referendum, said the prime minister's decision to suspend parliament from next week - a move apparently designed to stop MPs from blocking his Brexit plans - had backfired spectacularly, because it had unified his opponents and prompted them to prevent a no-deal Brexit in October.\n\n\"This crisis is of his own making,\"\n\n\"This crisis is of his own making,\"\n\nBebb said.\n\n\"There would not have been any significant action on no deal in this September sitting if it wasn't for the prime minister's decision to prorogue. This is a crisis that has been created by the prime minister acting on the advice he's been given by his advisers.\n\n\"He is now in a situation where, if everything I'm hearing is correct, he isn't going to get his election and he will have to extend,\" he said.\n\n\"And if he is saying he is not going to extend, he will have to resign, because it is inconceivable in my mind that a British prime minister will break the law.\"\n\n\"If people think this one through carefully, he will have no choice but to resign.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson will have no choice but to resign Guto Bebb MP, who had the Conservative whip removed after he voted to block a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7621/15d0baaf723544d0bb24e9580d3d074f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
