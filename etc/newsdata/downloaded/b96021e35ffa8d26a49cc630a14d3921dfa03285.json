And, you know, I grew up reciting Sojourner Truth's 'Ain't I a Woman' before I even knew what I was really saying.\n\n\"And I always recognized I've been carried by the ancestors. And Ta-Nehisi's book 'The Water Dancer' allows us to see that, but also to experience and feel what that carriage has been like.\"\n\nShe called it \"one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. Right up there in the Top 5.\n\n\"I was enthralled, I was devastated. I felt hope, I felt gratitude, I felt joy - I mean, it's the range of emotions,\" she said. \"That's why I think it has everything that a novel is supposed to [have]. I'm on my second read now, because the first read I was just reading to see if I was going to choose it. And then the second read, I actually am sort of spoonfeeding every word to myself.\"\n\nShe said to Coates, \"You are a magnificent writer ... The other day I was reading. I was thinking, 'Gosh, I wish Toni [Morrison] was alive to actually read this book.' She would be so proud.\"\n\nShe pointed to a passage on page 110 of the book in which Coates describes what slavery is:\n\n\"Slavery is every day longing. Is being born into a world of forbidden rituals and tantalizing untouchables. The land around you, the clothes you hem, the biscuits you bake. You bury the longing because you know where it must lead.\"\n\nCoates said he spent 10 years researching and writing \"The Water Dancer.\" \"It's deceptive because I actually started writing this before I started writing my second book, 'Between the World and Me,' before I wrote 'The Case for Reparations,'\" he said.\n\nCoates called being picked for the book club \"a tremendous, tremendous honor. You're going into the company of people like Toni Morrison, Colson Whitehead. This was, like, a huge, huge honor for me.\"\n\nThis Book Club pick is Oprah's first in partnership with Apple. \"That was my goal, was to partner with Apple and have a wide bandwidth so we can create a community of readers around the world,\" she said. \"I am most excited for people all the world to start reading this and go to @oprahsbookclub and have discussion about it. When you start reading it, you're going to want to talk to somebody.\"\n\n\"The Water Dancer\" goes on sale Tuesday.\n\nFor more from the conversation with Winfrey and Coates click on the video player below:\n\nOprah Winfrey talks Book Club pick with Ta-Nehisi Coates, \"The Water Dancer\"\n\nTune in to \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday for more with Coates on the inspiration for his novel.\n\nClick here for a reader's guide to \"The Water Dancer.\"", "description": "The acclaimed writer's debut novel tells the story of a young boy born into bondage on a plantation and the mysterious power he discovers", "authors": ["David Morgan"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/23/a629c950-4fae-4476-8827-6df7e0e73b7a/thumbnail/1200x630/0f41286d5e45aef09e8a6ee08b0d4260/0923-ctm-oprahsbookclubpart2-1938784-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
