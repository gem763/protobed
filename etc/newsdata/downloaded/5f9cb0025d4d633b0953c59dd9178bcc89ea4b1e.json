Col. Alexander Vindman on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said Schiff told the witness to not answer questions from some Republicans because Democrats were concerned they were trying to uncover the identity of the whistleblower who started the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"I think most of you know Chairman Schiff has prevented the witness from answering certain questions we have during the deposition,\" Jordan told reporters. \"You know, one of the things you do in these deposition is ask the basics, who, what, where, when, why. When we asked the whistleblower who he spoke to after important events in July, Adam Schiff said, 'No, no, we\u2019re not going to allow anybody answer that question.'\"\n\nJordan said that is despite how Schiff stated before the deposition that what is being discussed does not contain classified information. He said Republicans were not trying to identify the whistleblower, but trying to figure who to call for as a witness in future hearings.\n\n\"More importantly, who the sources are for the whistleblower that were the basis of him filing this complaint. And somehow, he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know that. Mr. Schiff and his staff are the only ones in America who can know...You saw it on display today when we tried to ask the witness certain questions and Mr. Shiff would not let him answer,\" Jordan said.\n\nDemocrats introduced the impeachment procedures resolution on Tuesday, which would finally give Republicans the ability to call their own witnesses and have subpoena power. Congress is expected to vote on the resolution on Thursday.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:58:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/302/182c2b25-f3ff-491f-9908-bac18e8af862.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
