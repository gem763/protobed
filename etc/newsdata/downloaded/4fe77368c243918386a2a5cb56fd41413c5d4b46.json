They can hang out in your pantry, undisturbed, for an eternity, and then when you\u2019re ready to bring them out to play, they do so with such power and energy the only downside is you feel guilty for not inviting them to the party earlier.\n\n[Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here]\n\nFor a plant-based cook, their appeal is even stronger, because they add the kind of depth and umami to your cooking that you may have thought was possible only through the use of low-and-slow-cooked meat.\n\nIn this soup recipe, dried porcini transform a simple combination of chickpeas, Swiss chard and aromatic vegetables. You soak them in hot water, strain them (they can also add grit if you don\u2019t) and use the soaking liquid as a mushroom stock \u2014 better than anything you can buy by the carton, trust me. You chop the rehydrated mushrooms and add them, too.\n\nThen the only issue is your patience: The soup is so flavorful, you may have to remind yourself that, rather than gulping it down, you should slow your pace and savor it. When you\u2019ve finished, be sure you have more dried mushrooms in your pantry for the next time the craving hits.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 ounce dried porcini\n\n3 cups hot water\n\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling\n\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter (may substitute vegan butter, such as Earth Balance)\n\n1 small yellow onion, chopped\n\n2 cloves garlic, finely chopped\n\nOne (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes, plus their juices\n\nOne (14-ounce) can no-salt-added chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n\n1 sprig rosemary\n\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\n10 ounces (1 bunch) Swiss chard, stemmed and shredded\n\nParmesan, hard goat cheese or other flavorful hard cheese, shaved (optional; may substitute vegan Parmesan)\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nSoak the porcini in the hot water for 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms with a slotted spoon, reserving the soaking water. Rinse the mushrooms brie\ufb02y under cold water (they can be gritty), pat dry with a clean dish towel and coarsely chop. Strain the mushroom soaking liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels into a bowl.\n\nStep 2\n\nIn a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the olive oil with the butter. When the mixture is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute, then add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes.\n\nStep 3\n\nAdd the tomatoes, chickpeas, rosemary, reserved mushroom soaking liquid, salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, and simmer gently until the flavors meld, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the chard and cook until it is tender, about 5 minutes.\n\nStep 4\n\nIf the soup seems too thick, thin it out with a little water. Discard the rosemary. Taste and add salt and/or pepper as needed. Ladle into warmed bowls, drizzle over some olive oil, and top with the cheese shavings, if using. Serve hot.\n\nTested by Joe Yonan; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.\n\nScale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nDid you make this recipe?
