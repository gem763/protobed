BreadTalk/Shin Min Daily News\n\nSingapore\u2019s BreadTalk group has been allowed to go ahead with its proposed acquisition of food court operator Food Junction Management (FJM).\n\nIn September, the bakery chain owner said it was looking to buy FJM\u2019s Singapore and Malaysia businesses, subject to shareholders\u2019 approval.\n\nBreadTalk said then that was looking to buy all of FJM\u2019s 1.489 million shares, which it would pay for in cash.\n\nReports at the time valued the proposed purchase at S$80 million.\n\nFood Junction currently runs 12 food courts in Singapore \u2013 including Jewel Changi Airport\u2019s Five Spice Food Court \u2013 and three in Malaysia.\n\nOn Tuesday (Oct 15), the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said that it had cleared the proposal by Topwin Investment Holding, a subsidiary of BreadTalk, which also owns brands such as Toast Box, Bread Society, The Icing Room and Food Republic.\n\n\u201cAfter consulting stakeholders and evaluating all relevant information, CCCS concluded that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, will not lead to a substantial lessening of competition within the relevant markets in Singapore,\u201d the authority said in a statement.\n\nCCCS said it reached the conclusion after public consultation and feedback from key stakeholders including landlords, competitors, food vendors and individual consumers. \u201cMost stakeholders indicated that they have no concerns with the proposed transaction, with a few raising concerns,\u201d it said.\n\nRelevant markets considered by CCCS include the selling of hot meals to individual consumers in food court premises, using catchment areas of 500 metres radius; and the rental of stalls in food court premises to food vendors within Singapore.\n\nCCCS found that the both companies \u201conly directly sell hot meals in a very limited number of stalls located within the food court premises they operate\u201d. They will also continue to compete with many stalls operated by third-party food vendors within their own premises as well as within other food court premises in the catchment areas after.\n\nRegarding concerns that the acquisition would reduce food quality, variety and push up price points, CCCS said its findings showed that shopping mall operators do help to ensure standards were kept acceptable.\n\n\u201cCCCS found that besides the presence of many competing third-party food vendors, shopping mall operators place significant emphasis on food court operators\u2019 ability to differentiate their food court concepts, food mix and price points, particularly if there is more than one food court premises in the mall.\n\n\u201cShopping mall operators also retain sufficient control over the prices, quality and choices of food available to individual consumers in their food court premises as they seek to attract more customer footfall to their malls. These concerns are therefore unlikely to materialise,\u201d it said.\n\nCombined market share of the companies post-merger will also remain below 20 per cent, which is \u201cconsiderably lower than the larger food court operators such as NTUC Kopitiam and Koufu\u201d, the authority said.\n\n\u201cThe merged entity may instead be able to better compete with the other larger food court operators post-merger,\u201d it added.\n\nCollusion between food court operators is also unlikely, as there are many competing operators with different cost structures and a low degree of transparency on rental fees which makes it difficult for food court operators to monitor one another\u2019s costs. Barriers to entry and expansion are also low, it said.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Combined market share of the companies post-merger will remain below 20%, CCCS said..
