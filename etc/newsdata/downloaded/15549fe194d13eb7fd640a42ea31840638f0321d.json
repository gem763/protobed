REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe Greater London Authority (GLA) said on Friday it had referred a \u201cconduct matter\u201d concerning Johnson to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which investigates complaints connected to the police.\n\nThe referral follows allegations, first reported by The Sunday Times, that when Johnson was mayor, he failed to declare close personal links to tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri who received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips.\n\nAsked about the referral, Johnson\u2019s spokesman told Reuters: \u201cThe prime minister as mayor of London did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK.\n\n\u201cEverything was done with propriety and in the normal way,\u201d he added.\n\nArcuri did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the police watchdog because Johnson was head of the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime, a role equivalent to a police commissioner, during his 2008-2016 term as mayor.\n\nUnder the referral, the authority will try to determine whether there are grounds for a full investigation that could lead to criminal charges of misconduct in public office.\n\nThe GLA said in a statement: \u201cThe Monitoring Officer of the GLA has today recorded a \u2018conduct matter\u2019 against Boris Johnson and referred him to the Independent Office for Police Conduct so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former Mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office.\u201d\n\nIt said the action had been taken in accordance with the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011.\n\nIn a letter to Johnson, the GLA said: \u201cSubject to any explanation provided by you, these matters give rise to a suggestion that there has been a failure to safeguard the public purse and if so that amounts to a significant breach of public trust.\n\n\u201cThese are the ingredients of the offence of misconduct in a public office,\u201d said the letter from the office of the authority\u2019s monitoring officer, which was made public.\n\nThe letter said Innotech, Arcuri\u2019s then company, received 11,500 pounds ($14,000) from London & Partners, the mayor\u2019s promotional agency, for two events in 2013 and 2014. She was able to attend a trade mission to Singapore and Malaysia in 2014 through Playbox, one of her companies, even though an initial application through Innotech had been declined.\n\nThe letter said the Monitoring Officer was also aware \u201cfrom media reports and elsewhere\u201d that Arcuri also had been allowed to participate in events around two other trade missions \u2014 to New York and Israel in 2015 \u2014 although she had not qualified for the New York mission and had been rejected for the mission to Israel.\n\nJohnson has vowed to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31. British opposition parties are discussing tabling a vote of no-confidence in Johnson as early as next week over his handling of Brexit, the Telegraph newspaper reported on Friday.", "description": "The government of London said it had referred\u00a0Prime Minister Boris Johnson to Britain\u2019s police watchdog for potential investigation over allegations of misconduct involving a U.S. businesswoman while he was mayor of London.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434889989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0FA", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
