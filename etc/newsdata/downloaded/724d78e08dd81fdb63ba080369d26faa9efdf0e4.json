It got an overall score of 39%.\n\nCleanliness was a major issue, with patrons calling the hotels \u201cfilthy\u201d, \u201cdreadful\u201d and \u201cscruffy\u201d.\n\neasyHotel, at 58%, and ibis budget, at 60%, were also among the lowest ranked.\n\nMore than 8,000 guests rated over 40 hotel chains for Which? Travel.\n\nWetherspoon Hotels topped the rankings for the first time, sharing the top spot with Premier Inn, the reigning champion for the last four years.\n\n(Image: Wetherspoons Hotels)\n\nWhich? Travel\u2019s Rory Boland said: \u201cThere really is no excuse for the grubby bathtubs and filthy rooms that we have seen year after year with Britannia, so it is best to avoid them.\u201d\n\nBritannia, which has 61 hotels in the UK, declined to comment.\n\nOn average guests were 10 times (31%) more likely to rate Britannia poorly in this category than across almost all the other hotel chains (3%).\n\nWhen a Which? investigator checked in to the Britannia Lodge at Gatwick, they were greeted with \u2018damp smells\u2019 emanating from a clogged ventilation fan and a \u2018grubby\u2019 bathtub.\n\nEven worse, an ultraviolet light showed up stains that could not be seen with the naked eye, on both the bed sheets and the walls surrounding the toilet.\n\neasyHotel, which is on average cheaper than Britannia, had a 58 per cent customer score and managed to avoid any one-star ratings, but was mediocre in most categories, earning two stars in areas including bathrooms, bed comfort and bedrooms.\n\nWhen Which? visited one of the budget chain\u2019s sites in London\u2019s Old Street the researcher found it had \u2018all the charm of a hospital ward\u2019.\n\nOne customer who had stayed in the hotel advised: \u2018Don\u2019t stay there unless you\u2019re very drunk and there\u2019s no way of getting home.\u2019\n\nIbis Budget was only slightly better rated, with a customer score of 60 per cent. While it scored three stars for customer service, value for money and cleanliness it was let down by the quality of its rooms and its food offering.\n\n(Image: Accor Hotels)\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Wetherspoon Hotels made it to the top of the rankings for the first time - sharing first place with Premier Inn, the reigning champion for the last four years.\n\nGuests raved to Which? about Wetherspoon for its \u2018huge stylish rooms,\u2019 which earned it a full five stars in the bedroom quality category - and a 79 per cent customer score overall.\n\nWetherspoon - with prices as low as \u00a339 for a one-night stay and \u00a35 extra for breakfast - was also the most likely of the chains to be rated excellent for value for money.\n\nRory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, added: \u201cIf you are looking for a cheap and cheerful stay in the centre of town you would be better off choosing the ever-reliable Premier Inn or a Wetherspoon Hotel, where even with paying extra for breakfast you can expect extraordinarily good value for money.\u201d\n\nBest hotels...\n\nPremier Inn - customer score 79% (average price paid \u00a370) Wetherspoon hotels - customer score 79% (average price paid \u00a360) Hilton Garden Inn - customer score 78% (average price paid \u00a3100) Radisson Blu Edwardian - customer score 77% (average price paid \u00a3139) Hilton Hampton - customer score 74% (average price paid \u00a3100)\n\nWorst hotels...", "description": "A Which? consumer poll saw patrons describe Britannia Hotels as \u201cfilthy\u201d, \u201cdreadful\u201d and \u201cscruffy\u201d", "authors": ["Stephen White", "Image", "Joseph Raynor", "Nottingham Post", "Wetherspoons Hotels", "Accor Hotels"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14153045.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wetherspoon-Hotels.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
