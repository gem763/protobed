We got ourselves back into it and finished really strongly.\n\n\"I'm definitely proud of our tactic against Fiji which was to work their forwards and to make them tackle and keep the ball on the park as much as we possibly could... and our fitness showed how hard we worked in the camps leading up to this competition.\"", "description": "Flyhalf Dan Biggar will miss Wales's final Rugby World Cup pool game after a sickening head clash in the 29-17 win over Fiji.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7875/aa01c9dba8094650b090c58cd22b16c4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
