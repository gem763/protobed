Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn Nevada, Sanders and Biden are deadlocked at 22 percent each, followed by Warren\u2019s 18 percent, well within the poll\u2019s margin of error. No other candidate got higher than 5 percent.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn South Carolina, Biden has a more comfortable lead. He has 37 percent, to Warren\u2019s 16 percent and Sanders\u2019 11 percent. The next candidate got 4 percent.\n\nThe polls come after other surveys over the past week of the first two nominating states, Iowa and New Hampshire, showed Warren inching in front of Biden and Sanders far behind the top two candidates.\n\nSouth Carolina has consistently been Biden\u2019s best-polling early nominating state, as he attracts a sizable amount of support from black voters, a crucial Democratic voting bloc in the state.\n\nForty-five percent of black Democratic primary voters said they support Biden. Sanders got 13 percent and Warren received 4 percent. But 29 percent of white voters in the state said they support Biden, compared with 28 percent for Warren and 8 percent for Sanders.\n\n\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Nevada is set to hold its caucuses on Feb. 22, with the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, just before the Super Tuesday primaries on March 3 .\n\nThe polls, which count toward qualification for the next two Democratic presidential primary debates, also bring good news for two candidates: billionaire Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nSteyer garnered 3 percent support in the South Carolina poll and 4 percent in Nevada, while Yang was at 3 percent in Nevada.\n\nThis leaves both candidates just short of qualifying for the November debate, with more than a month until qualification closes. Both have hit at least 3 percent in three polls approved by the Democratic National Committee, meaning both need just one more poll each to qualify. In addition to getting 3 percent in four DNC-approved polls, candidates also need to get donations from 165,000 unique donors, and both Steyer's and Yang\u2019s campaigns have said they\u2019ve hit that threshold.\n\nBiden, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang have all qualified for the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, along with seven other candidates: Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe DNC told campaigns on Friday that all the candidates will share one stage on Oct. 15, even if all 12 qualifying candidates participate, pending a final decision from the party committee. Qualification for the October debate closes on Tuesday, but no other candidate is expected to join them.\n\nThe Nevada poll was conducted by SSRS between Sept. 22-26 and surveyed 324 likely Democratic caucus participants, with a margin of error of plus or minus 7.1 percentage points. The South Carolina poll was conducted over the same time period and surveyed 406 likely Democratic primary voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.9 percentage points.", "description": "Black voters continue to propel Biden to a commanding lead in the first-in-the-south primary state.", "authors": ["Zach Montellaro"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1e/51/0ca937bd409c95e41dd9a4954885/20190929-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
