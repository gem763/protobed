(REUTERS/Kacper Pempel)\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence, addressing US and Polish armed forces in Warsaw on February 13, emphasized the importance of NATO, reaffirmed the US commitment to the principle of collective defense, and encouraged allies to meet the Alliance\u2019s defense-spending goal. It is an open question, however, whether his boss, US President Donald J. Trump, shares his conviction.\n\n\u201cWhile Vice President Pence\u2019s words were eloquent and reassuring, allies have learned that there is a disconnect between the administration\u2019s policy and the president\u2019s own feelings about NATO and other US alliances,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and a former deputy secretary general of NATO.\n\n\u201cWe saw this when Pence went on a similar \u2018reassurance tour\u2019 two years ago, featuring an appearance at the Munich Security Conference, only to see the president fumble several early opportunities to reaffirm his commitment to NATO\u2019s Article 5 guarantee,\u201d said Vershbow.\n\n\u201cTrump finally got it right on Article 5 during his own visit to Warsaw in the summer of 2017, and he seemed to declare victory on the burden-sharing issue during his State of the Union address two weeks ago. But allies worry that his transactional, zero-sum approach could flare up again at the slightest provocation\u2014for example, if the current truce on trade between the United States and the European Union breaks down,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his address in Warsaw, Pence said: \u201c[T]o confront the threats that we face today, the people of Poland know, and the people of the United States know, that the free world needs the members of NATO to be strong and united. And so we are. We stand together in defense of our alliance and all that we hold dear. And each member nation, we know, has a vital role to play.\u201d\n\nWhile affirming the US commitment to Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense, Pence also urged allies to meet the 2 percent of defense spending goal set at NATO\u2019s Wales Summit in 2014. \u201cAt the heart of our NATO Alliance is a solemn promise that an attack on one is an attack on all,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBut to keep this oath requires preparation, it requires investment. And for every NATO member to uphold their commitment to our common defense, we need to work together.\u201d\n\nDaniel Fried, a distinguished senior fellow in the Atlantic Council\u2019s Future Europe Initiative and Eurasia Center, said: \u201cVice President Pence\u2019s affirmation of the US commitment to its NATO allies is welcome. He did a good job integrating language of solidarity with a call for allies to invest more in their own security.\u201d\n\nNoting the significance of the location of Pence\u2019s address, Fried said: \u201cThe message of solidarity is especially good for Poland, a solid ally exposed to potential Russian aggression, eighty years after a failure of solidarity led to a Nazi-Soviet attack on Poland and the Second World War, and thirty years after Poland led the way to the downfall of the Iron Curtain and a generation of peace, prosperity, and democracy throughout Europe.\u201d\n\nFried said he hoped Trump \u201ccan make similar statements, not just in Poland but in Germany and other European countries.\u201d\n\nAfter surprising his closest advisers by failing to explicitly commit to Article 5 at a meeting of Alliance leaders in Brussels in May of 2017, Trump affirmed US commitment to NATO\u2019s collective defense article two months later.\n\nOn June 5, addressing the Atlantic Council\u2019s Distinguished Leadership Awards dinner in Washington, Pence affirmed the US commitment to NATO and Article 5.\n\nAffirmation of NATO from US officials is always welcome news for allies, but especially so when it comes from the Trump administration which is led by a president who has shaken the faith of some of the United States\u2019 closest allies.\n\nLike Barack Obama before him, Trump has pressed allies to meet the two percent of GDP defense spending goal. The target date for achieving that goal is 2024. But as allies\u2019 spending has inched up, Trump has touted this increase as a direct result of his pressure.\n\nTrump can \u201cclaim success in squeezing additional defense spending out of the allies since he took office and began hammering them to fulfill the two-percent-of GDP pledge. But the upward trend began before he took office, in 2015 and 2016, as allies reacted to the new threat posed by an aggressive Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2014,\u201d said Vershbow.\n\nFried pointed out that Trump and many presidents before him have urged NATO allies to spend more on their own defense.\n\n\u201cTrends are good and the president can claim some of the credit for pushing the issue. But the president\u2019s messages on NATO have been mixed\u2014it is one thing to push for more military spending by allies but another to suggest that the United States regards NATO as some sort of income-generating instrument,\u201d Fried said. \u201cAmerican power has kept the general peace in Europe for over seventy years. Casting doubt about whether America will honor its commitment to its allies, especially when allies fought at our side in Afghanistan and Iraq for many years, damages the United States, and could be taken as a green light for aggression.\u201d\n\nPence maintained that while the United States\u2019 security and prosperity is a priority for the Trump administration, \u201cAmerica first does not mean America alone.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Trump\u2019s approach to allies has forced some in NATO to look at what they can do by and for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe damage caused by the president\u2019s bullying to the trust and confidence that underpins NATO unity may be hard to repair, even as NATO\u2019s defense posture and readiness continue to improve,\u201d said Vershbow.\n\nMaking the point that the \u201cNATO Alliance is not something apart from the United States,\u201d Fried said: \u201cSome NATO allies, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, are increasing their readiness, making it clear that they will fight if attacked, a message which the Russians understand. Germany, Canada and Great Britain, as well as the United States, are leading NATO deployment in these countries.\u201d\n\nNoting that the European Union has discussed the possibility of raising its own defense profile for many years, Fried said: \u201cThis can help, if done in ways that improve defense capacity.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vershbow said, European capabilities are far too meager to allow the Europeans to take greater responsibility for their own defense.\n\n\u201cAs a first step, they should set a higher level of ambition so that, within a decade, Europe can deliver at least half of the key high-end capabilities NATO needs to deter and defend against Russia, capabilities now provided almost entirely by the United States,\u201d he suggested.\n\nAshish Kumar Sen is deputy director of communications, editorial, at the Atlantic Council.
