'It's a little bit early. There are one or two who have been at it for a period of time. That's not to say he won't get in because I've been to see him.\n\n'Last week was brilliant - it was great to see and great for football I thought. The whole crowd connected with it.\n\n'He's up against some good players in Tom Davies, Joe Willock, Phil Foden and Oliver Skipp. There is some talent there \u2013 it's a tough area to break into.'\n\nTwo of Boothroyd's former stars, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham, are set for involvement for Gareth Southgate's seniors in Czech Republic \u2013 something that is providing motivation for the Under-21 group.\n\nHe will be up against players such as Tom Davies, Joe Willock, and Phil Foden for the role\n\n'It gives us all hope, it gives us all job satisfaction,' he added. 'We're all working towards a common goal, which is to get players through to Gareth.\n\n'It's heart-warming. We saw them walking past our medical room (at St George's Park) waving as they go past.' Willock \u2014 who has three Arsenal goals already this season \u2014 believes watching his peers thrive offers incentives to this squad.\n\n'It's amazing to see that there is a pathway. Southgate puts young players in who are doing well and working hard,' Willock said.\n\n'I'm happy for them but I'm excited for myself as well because I know I can do it. One day I can hopefully represent the Three Lions in the senior team.'", "description": "Newcastle\u00a0hero Matty Longstaff is on the radar of England's Under 21s for future squads.
