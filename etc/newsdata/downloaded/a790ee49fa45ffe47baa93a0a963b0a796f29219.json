I never spoke of any other woman to Matt [Agnew], I never said anything insulting to any of the women and I certainly didn't make any of them feel the way that I felt. Yet somehow, I was the villain,' she wrote.\n\nAbbie said some of the women made her feel unwelcome in the mansion, and she found herself feeling paranoid and crying almost every day.\n\nShe added that having her heart broken in the finale (Matt chose Chelsie McLeod as his winner, leaving Abbie in second place) was made worse by the bullying she faced on social media.\n\nEmotional journey: The 24-year-old property analyst defended herself in a passionate essay, saying she was unfairly portrayed as the show's antagonist\n\nAbbie endured months of harassment on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram from strangers who shamed her for how she behaved on screen.\n\n'It is extremely disheartening and concerning to see the eager willingness of the Australian public to jump on this bandwagon,' she wrote.\n\nIn a final message to reality TV fans, Abbie concluded: 'Analyse your opinions, consider if your message or comment will add or take [away] from the recipient's day and finally, please, just be kind.'\n\nHer say: 'I never did anything mean to any of the women,' Abbie wrote in an article for Whimn\n\nIt's not the first time Abbie has taken aim at her online trolls.\n\nIn a recent Instagram post, she complained about being 'sl*t shamed' for the clothes she wore on The Bachelor as well as her steamy dates with Matt Agnew.\n\nShe wrote: 'This is something I did not expect in 2019.
