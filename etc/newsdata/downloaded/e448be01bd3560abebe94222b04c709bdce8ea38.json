He cut his communication with me and then reached out to me telling me that he divorced me. Then, after two months, he returned and wanted me back.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents were afraid that if he took me back to Al Dhale, he would continue mistreating me there. I stayed in my parents\u2019 house until I gave birth and got obstetric fistula.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him about my health condition and explained to him that I might go to have surgery abroad, he abandoned me. He did not support me financially or emotionally. He said he would divorce me.\u201d\n\nSalem, who alleges her husband subjected her to domestic violence during their marriage, said she developed obstetric fistula due to not receiving proper treatment in the hospital while giving birth. She said she was in such excruciating pain that she could not sleep.\n\n\u201cThere was no anaesthetic and I was bleeding,\u201d the mother-of-one says. \u201cI waited impatiently for a long time for them to take me into the operation room. I was in horrible pain and I wanted it to be over. After I left the operation room, the effects of the anaesthetic had worn off and the pain came again and it was even more awful. I was moving left and right screaming in pain.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation estimates more than two million young women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with untreated obstetric fistula.\n\nSalem, who now works as a midwife helping local women in her community, describes that period of her life as her \u201cdark days\u201d \u2013 saying she was deeply depressed. But things began to feel more hopeful after she managed to have surgery, after learning about an organisation which treated women who have obstetric fistula.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

When he learned that I was cured, he came back apologising, and said he wanted to live with me again. He said he was mistaken but I refused to go back to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there when I needed him the most and he treated me badly. I did not feel that I was his wife. I always felt that he married me for his pleasure only.\n\n\u201cThis time, I asked for the divorce. He asked for money in order to divorce me. He left me for months, not divorced nor married. He did not even send money for his daughter. Finally, we spoke to a religious leader who saw me and my daughter and I told him that I want to be divorced. In the end, my husband sent a message via WhatsApp that he divorced me.\u201d\n\nMs Salem is not alone in her struggle to access healthcare. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns a troubling dearth of funding for sexual and reproductive health services is placing the lives of women and babies in the war-ravaged country at grave risk.\n\nThe UNFPA, which has lent its backing to 268 reproductive health clinics in Yemen, was forced into shutting 100 services at the end of August and will have to close an additional 75 this month. They say 650,000 women and girls will subsequently be left with no way to reach life-saving services.\n\nThe UN organisation, which strives to improve reproductive health across the world, sayw they have already stopped being able to obtain medicine for those services that are due to close.\n\nThe UNFPA estimates there to be six million women and teenage girls who are of childbearing age in the poorest of the Arab countries and more than one million pregnant and lactating women in dire need of \u201cimmediate treatment for acute malnutrition and further medical assistance\u201d.\n\nThe agency is currently experiencing a funding gap of $77 million for its 2019 Yemen humanitarian response, having only managed to obtain $33 million.\n\nThe conflict, which has lasted more than four years and claimed tens of thousands of lives, has prompted what has been described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis by the United Nations.\n\nAnjali Sen, the UNFPA\u2019s representative for Yemen, said: \u201cThe closure of the facilities is very worrying. We have seen the collapse of the economy and social services during the conflict. Women and girls are bearing the brunt of the war. it has been particularly harsh for them and they remain the most vulnerable at risk group of people in the country.\u201d\n\nThe humanitarian worker, who has been based in Yemen for the last two and a half years, added: \u201cWe are talking about a country where every two hours a woman dies from complications with pregnancy and childbirth, while another 20 suffers injuries, infections or disabilities that could have been prevented.\n\n\u201cThe closures mean women might develop life-threatening diseases. Women and girls are at high risk of death from totally preventable causes or their babies being born stunted or malnourished. There are already many cases where women in far-flung rural areas giving birth without midwives to assist them. Sahar is one of the thousands of stories of women who have had complications surrounding their pregnancy.\u201d", "description": "Sahar Salem says her\u00a0husband immediately sought to divorce her when he discovered she had become incontinent after giving birth.
