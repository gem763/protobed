Dual polarization radar products argue otherwise and some of these returns are above 10,000ft\u201d.\n\nThe service added: \u201cMigrating dragonflies is a possibility...they migrate in fall, usually prior to cooler weather arriving, and towards areas where more precipitation has fallen recently. That said, not sure DFs can fly that high or if they move in numbers great enough to produce these returns\u201d\n\nAnother National Weather Service station in Cleveland also picked up the huge cloud and asked users on Twitter to guess what was causing it.\n\nThey later tweeted: \u201cWhile we are not biological experts, we have determined (through input from our followers) that it\u2019s most likely dragonflies mixed with other insects/birds!\u201d\n\nBit of a radar conundrum today.

The species is found from the northern US states down to Texas, Mexico and Panama.

Squirrels were going nuts.\u201d\n\nThe species is reportedly the common green darner \u2013 named due to their resemblance to a darning needle. They fly south at the end of the summer, following their prey \u2013 mosquitoes and flies \u2013 to warmer climates in the southern states and central American countries.\n\nRead more\n\nDragonflies were among the first winged creatures to evolve.
