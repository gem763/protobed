Case in point: The 37-year-old popstar just shared a new Instagram post of herself doing yoga in a bikini, and it\u2019s seriously impressive.\n\nIn the video, the \"Make Me\" singer can be seen wearing a teal bikini while doing yoga on top of a partner, who appears to be her boyfriend, personal trainer Sam Asghari. She does a couple of back bends followed by a few inversions while her partner holds her up. Brit doesn\u2019t stop there, though: She also raises her legs, spreads them, and does stuff in the air that most people can\u2019t even do when they\u2019re on solid land.\n\n\"Only in LA can you wear a bathing suit in October! It\u2019s so beautiful out .... and first time to walk on my hands up and down stairs,\" she wrote in the caption. Check out the acrobatic action here:\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Britney is flexible: She regularly shares videos on Instagram of herself doing handstands, back bends, and splits. She\u2019s also super into yoga and, apparently, bikini yoga.\n\nBack in May, she shared an Instagram video of herself doing yoga on what appeared to be a golf course set to the tune of Cardi B\u2019s \"I Like It.\" In that vid, Britney did more back bends and even walked on her hands\u2014ya know, as one does. \"Yoga on the green. I really like it LIKE THAT !!\" she wrote on the caption.\n\nSo yeah, you might say Britney\u2019s pretty good at yoga...\n\nFrom Women's Health\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Her core strength is legit.", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oK6orMeqaTBl7vEDp2pD0Q--~B/aD0yOTM7dz01ODQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/5bc4a79e739f97cdc86f3e8c0ee4e2ad", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
