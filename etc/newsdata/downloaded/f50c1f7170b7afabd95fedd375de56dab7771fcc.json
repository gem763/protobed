Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) of Montana.\n\nMontana state auditor Rosendale, who is running for Montana\u2019s at-large congressional district, spoke with Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle regarding the Democrats\u2019 move to impeach President Donald Trump, his proposals to reduce the cost of health care in Montana, and his Democrat opponent, Kathleen Williams.\n\nRosendale compared Williams to the progressive Democrat Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, often known as \u201cAOC.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cDemocrat Kathleen Williams is the AOC of Montana. She\u2019s educated in Berkeley California, there\u2019s a lot of people that don\u2019t know a lot about California, but they certainly don\u2019t have a lot of conservative ideas out of Berkeley and Kathleen Williams is going to be the gun-grabbing, green New Deal, industry eliminating\u201d candidate.\n\nRosendale said Williams is a \u201cpuppet for the left in Montana.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Williams, conservative leaders Reps. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Mark Meadows (R-NC), and Jim Jordan (R-OH) endorsed Rosendale for his congressional race.\n\nWhile serving as a state auditor, Rosendale led the way for Montana to lower the cost of health care.\n\nRosendale announced in August that, by enacting a reinsurance program, they have managed to lower health insurance premiums by eight to 14 percent.\n\nRosendale explained, \u201cThe good news is about me not going to the United States Senate means that I was able to spend another year helping our legislator pass some tremendous healthcare reform. And so number one, we went in and focused like a laser on the costs of insurance. Many across the nation have seen the absolute failure of Obamacare trying to say everyone has insurance, can\u2019t afford it, it\u2019s not working out. The cost has just been overwhelming for them so we focused on making sure people had access to good, affordable, healthcare.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe authorize direct primary care facilities which are delivering high-quality healthcare for $70-90 a month. We worked with the Trump administration on the Association Health Plans [AHPs] so that you can buy a product across a state line, extended the term for short-term duration for that 90-day window as much as three years as much as necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the big things that we focused on is that people with pre-existing conditions can continue to have that coverage and yet not drive up the cost of health insurance products for everyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.
