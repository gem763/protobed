Stier notified the FBI and senators about the incident. Although the FBI did not investigate the claim, two officials who communicated with Stier corroborated the story to the Times.\n\nIn the updated version of the article, the following passage was added: \"the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.\"\n\n\"An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article,\" read the editor's note at the bottom of the story that was added Sunday evening.\n\nAfter the report's publication Saturday, liberal activist organizations and some 2020 Democratic candidates called for Kavanaugh to be impeached. President Trump defended Kavanaugh in a salvo of tweets and urged him to \"start suing.\"\n\nStier's account echoes that of Deborah Ramirez, who previously accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis into her face at a drunken dormitory party, prompting her to swat it away and accidentally touch it in the process.\n\nAs noted in the Federalist, the Times reporters also did not mention that Stier was one of the attorneys representing former President Bill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation in the 1990s while Kavanaugh was part of Ken Starr's team leading the inquiry.\n\nKavanaugh faced other allegations of sexual misconduct, including that of Christine Blasey Ford, who last year testified during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings that he had attempted to force himself on her at a high school party in the 1980s. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations put forth by Ramirez and Ford, but did not answer questions about Steir's account.", "description": "More than a day after publishing a bombshell expos\u00e9 detailing a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the New York Times added a significant passage, along with an editor's note, that undercuts the claim.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a808bbb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+17/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F72%2Fb6%2Fe53c6b3942ae9c52a996dd33ae8d%2Fkavanaugh-091718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
