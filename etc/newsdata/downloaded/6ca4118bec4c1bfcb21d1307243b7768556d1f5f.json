Citing a Twitter thread Ya\u00ebl Eisenstat, in which she said she had previously suggested scanning ads for misinformation to \u201csilent\u201d responses from her bosses, Collins asked: \u201cWhat proposals has [the team] made, to what extent were these proposals determined to be feasible, and on what grounds were they not progressed?\u201d Collins also asked about whether Facebook would be formalising its relationship with its third-party fact checkers \u201cin the long-term\u201d.\n\nThe committee\u2019s letter comes after Facebook\u2019s vice-president, Richard Allan, announced the company\u2019s plans for a possible UK general election in the next few months. Writing in the Telegraph, Allan promised a \u201cdedicated operations centre\u201d in the UK if an election is declared, to quickly remove content that breaks Facebook\u2019s rules, such as misleading information about the mechanics of the election, or content aimed at encouraging users not to vote at all.\n\nAllan also promised a dedicated channel to report harassment for MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates, and a wider selection of adverts contained in the site\u2019s ad library, which will now store adverts about issues including immigration, health and the environment, as well as elections and referenda, as it previously did.\n\nCollins\u2019s letter comes on the heels of a major series of announcements by Facebook designed to plan for a US election in 2020, including stricter rules on disclosing who controls a popular page, and new bans on political adverts that attack democracy in general.", "description": "Commons committee demands explanation \u2018given constraints it will place on combatting disinformation\u2019", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df2fa97c75b649ed7ad253cb056fe71a4652260/415_242_2375_1425/master/2375.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=97bfb4b8a6a5d0c1bb5432ed7f93e538", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
