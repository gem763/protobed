The clip touches on little else outside of Liu\u2019s physical features.\n\nLiu, who acknowledged that he\u2019s \u201cnever been called ugly so many times in my entire life,\u201d explained in his post that it\u2019s almost impossible to avoid voices of doubt. However, he copes with the haters by accepting the critics.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s never been about trying to shut the voices out - it\u2019s a fruitless effort (especially if people happen to be making Youtube videos about it lol). Rather, it\u2019s about learning to let the voices exist and be OKAY with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still doing my thing, and I\u2019m still over the moon happy I get this amazing opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhile Liu said he won\u2019t allow the haters to take away from his casting and excitement around the film, he did add that the video could\u2019ve addressed far more legitimate reasons for audiences to discuss the upcoming movie, namely the at-times problematic source material the movie is based on.\n\nWhen Marvel had announced that \u201cShang-Chi\u201d was in the works, many Chinese viewers took issue with the origins of the storyline, namely the superhero\u2019s father in the comics, Fu Manchu. Fu Manchu had historically symbolized \u201cyellow peril,\u201d painting Asians as a threat to the West. While Marvel announced that The Mandarin, another character of Chinese descent played by Tony Leung, would serve as the villain in the movie, some fans were concerned that the character would be plagued with the same stereotypes attached to Fu Manchu.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope this Youtube channel will attack topics with a bit more journalistic and creative integrity in the future... there are a lot of real and valid reasons why audiences find Shang Chi\u2019s source material to be controversial and I love the discussion that\u2019s taking place,\u201d Liu wrote. \u201cThis... not so much.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d actor responded gracefully to a YouTube video targeting his appearance.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d51c0693b00004d00daeeb2.jpeg?cache=lqd9kvuuxg&ops=1778_1000"}
